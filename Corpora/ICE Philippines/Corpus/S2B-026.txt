Loi Ejercito my beloved country men
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#2:1:A>
I Joseph Ejercito Estrada President of the Republic of the
Philippines with the nation the world and God as my witness do hereby
reaffirm my unwavering commitment to democracy <O> applause </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#3:1:A>
I stand by my solemn oath to defend the Constitution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#4:1:A>
As President I will always uphold freedom in all its various forms
including the freedom of speech of the press of worship of assembly and of
choice
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#5:1:A>
<.> Na </.> <O> applause </O> None of these freedoms are under
threat
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#6:1:A>
Those who fear the loss of freedom do not share my faith in the
strength of our Constitution in the sturdiness of our institutions in the
passion of our people to preserve their freedom and in their determination
and power to defend it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#7:1:A>
Freedom may have been lost before it will never be lost again <O> 
applause </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#8:1:A>
Our people will see to that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#9:1:A>
I as President will stake my own life on it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#10:1:A>
Yet <O> applause </O> yet may I remind our people that liberty
without responsibility is license that freedom does not confer the right to
violate the law or the rights of others that freedom without responsibility
is a formula for chaos anarchy and lawlessness
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#11:1:A>
The paranoid will take that last statement as a hidden threat
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#12:1:A>
The rest will see it as a self-evident principle accepted
throughout the ages and needing neither apology nor defense
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#13:1:A>
Yet given a choice between freedom and restraint I will choose to
err on the side of freedom <O> applause </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#14:1:A>
To paraphrase Voltaire I may not agree with what you say but I will
defend to to the death your right to say it but that does not mean I waive
the right to argue with you
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#15:1:A>
That is as much my constitutional right as it is yours
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#16:1:A>
Let all doubts be erased democracy freedom and the Constitution are
alive and well in this country <O> applause </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#17:1:A>
Now to other issues
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#18:1:A>
Although I am blessed with many friends I have no cronies <O> 
applause </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#19:1:A>
I have turned down and will continue to turn down all requests for
a government bailout of financially-strapped companies as I did in the case
of Philippine Airlines owned by Mr Lucio Tan <O> applause </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#20:1:A>
The sequestered shares of Mr Eduardo Cojuangco Jr in San Miguel
Corporation are under litigation and will stay as such until the case is
resolved
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#21:1:A>
There is no deal involved here with Mr Cojuangco
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#22:1:A>
The extradition process involving Mr Mark Jimenez will proceed in
accordance with due process of law without obstruction
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#23:1:A>
There are no secret deals with the Marcoses
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#24:1:A>
I hope this answers your immediate concerns <O> several sentences
in Filipino interspersed with applause </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#25:1:A>
Today I fulfill my constitutional mandate to address Congress on
the first day of its regular session
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#26:1:A>
By tradition I am to dwell on the state of the nation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#27:1:A>
Let me start with a sincere apology to all those who expected or
wished to see me fail
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#28:1:A>
I 'm sorry to disappoint them <O> applause </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#29:1:A>
I am pleased to report that our nation is rising growing and
strengthening
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#30:1:A>
This is in contrast to the situation I described to you last year
and which I vowed to reverse <O> several sentences in Filipino </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#31:1:A>
Last year when I first addressed this august body our nation was in
an economic crisis
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#32:1:A>
Today we are out of it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#33:1:A>
Last year I told you that our aim was to help the country escape
the recession
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#34:1:A>
We did it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#35:1:A>
In nineteen ninety-eight most of our Asian neighbors sank into
recession
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#36:1:A>
In contrast our country managed a modest but positive growth of
one-tenth of one percent in our Gross National Product
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#37:1:A>
However our Gross Domestic Product dipped by one-half percent or
points or zero point five during the year
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#38:1:A>
In the first quarter of this year our G N P abruptly surged upward
by two percent and our G D P by one point two percent
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#39:1:A>
Last year we were struggling to keep ourselves from sinking
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#40:1:A>
Today we are sailing towards the high seas again
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#41:1:A>
It is time once more to pay tribute to a special class of Filipinos
our overseas workers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#42:1:A>
They as a group kept our G N P growth at positive rates even during
the worst of times
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#43:1:A>
They continue to be our economic saviors
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#44:1:A>
Last year I expressed my hope of keeping inflation at a
single-digit rate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#45:1:A>
We did it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#46:1:A>
In nineteen ninety-eight the inflation rate was at a full-year <.> 
av </.> average of nine point seven percent
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#47:1:A>
It improved further to a six-month average of eight point four
percent in the first half of nineteen ninety-nine
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#48:1:A>
In June alone inflation was down to five point eight percent
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#49:1:A>
Inflation is a vicious enemy of the poor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#50:1:A>
Last year I said that without undermining the independence of the
 <indig> Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas </indig> we would support the lowering of
interest rates
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#51:1:A>
We did it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#52:1:A>
In the past twelve-months period alone the benchmark ninety-one day
treasury-bill rate dropped steeply from fourteen point nine percent on the
first auction on July six nineteen ninety-eight to eight point four percent
last Monday
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#53:1:A>
This is its lowest level in more than twelve years
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#54:1:A>
Bank lending rates have also dropped to pre-crisis levels
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#55:1:A>
Last year I lamented the devaluation of the peso as imposing
burdens on our people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#56:1:A>
I inferred that we should strengthen our currency
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#57:1:A>
We did it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#58:1:A>
At the beginning of nineteen ninety-eight the peso plunged to an
all time low of forty-five pesos and forty-two centavos to one dollar
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#59:1:A>
At the beginning of my administration it was at forty-two pesos and
four centavos
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#60:1:A>
Since then the peso has strengthened dramatically
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#61:1:A>
It has stabilized within a range of thirty-seven to thirty-nine to
the dollar
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#62:1:A>
This was achieved largely by leaving the market alone and the
market responded with a show of confidence it sent billions of dollars of
loans investments and exports orders to the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#63:1:A>
The <indig> Bangko Sentral </indig> intervened only occasionally to
prevent wild swings and to forestall speculative attacks not to set the
trends of or levels of the exchange rate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#64:1:A>
Last year I committed to more effective and efficient tax
collection
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#65:1:A>
We did it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#66:1:A>
Despite the ravages of the Asian crisis on tax collections total
revenues amounted to four hundred sixty-two billion in nineteen ninety-eight
of which tax revenues constituted four hundred sixteen billion or four
billion pesos higher than in nineteen ninety-seven
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#67:1:A>
For the first <.> ti </.> for the first four months of nineteen
ninety uh nine nineteen ninety-nine B I R collection reached one hundred
twenty-six billion or three point two percent higher than in nineteen
ninety-eight
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#68:1:A>
Custom collections amounted to twenty-three point one billion pesos
and non-tax revenue fourteen point one billion pesos
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#69:1:A>
This does not mean that we are happy with our tax <.> re </.> <.> 
rep </.> effort
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#70:1:A>
We need to improve not only our collection performance but the tax
structure itself and hence our existing tax laws
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#71:1:A>
Last year we found the government in a deeper fiscal hole than the
public had been made to believe
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#72:1:A>
We committed to reduce the government deficit
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#73:1:A>
This time we didn't do it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#74:1:A>
It is not that we failed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#75:1:A>
We deliberately shifted shifted course
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#76:1:A>
At a time when the economy was threatened by recession uh the
administration has decided on a twenty-five percent across-the-board forced
savings on the expenditures of the government
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#77:1:A>
This was like administering the medicine for high blood pressure to
a patient with low blood pressure
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#78:1:A>
<X> <indig> Lalong lulubha ang pasyente dahil baka mamatay nang di
pa oras </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#X79:1:A>
That is why my favorite doctor the First Lady always makes sure
that my blood pressure is normal especially when I 'm reading the newspapers
 </X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#80:1:A>
We scrapped the forced cutbacks and did exactly the opposite
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#81:1:A>
We not only ensured that public services would continue at adequate
levels
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#82:1:A>
We also engaged in various pump-priming
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#83:1:A>
Our aim was not to save but to spend
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#84:1:A>
This was to counteract the slowdown in private consumption and
investment expenditures in other words to raise the country 's declining
blood pressure rather than let it sink further
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#85:1:A>
Our logic was simple
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#86:1:A>
A time of growth and threats of inflation calls for balanced
budgets or surpluses to prevent further inflation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#87:1:A>
But a time of recession and deflation calls for budget <.> de </.> 
deficits to jump-start a recovery
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#88:1:A>
Thus towards the end of nineteen ninety-eight we increased the
budget deficit to fifty billion or one point eight percent of the G N P
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#89:1:A>
For the first time and for the first five months of nineteen
ninety-nine we incurred as planned a deficit of forty-five point three
billion pesos still within the nineteen ninety-nine program deficit of
sixty-eight point four billion pesos or two point two percent of target G N P
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#90:1:A>
For the next two years we intend to reduce our deficit to one point
one percent and zero point four percent of G N P and eventually attain a
balanced budget in the year two thousand two and surpluses thereafter
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#91:1:A>
In other words I will not end my term with a deficit <O> applause
 </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#92:1:A>
One problem we faced was how to finance the deficit
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#93:1:A>
Borrowing locally would have raised interest rates at a time when
we wanted them to go down
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#94:1:A>
Borrowing abroad was too costly
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#95:1:A>
Monetary expansion would have triggered inflation and a run on the
peso
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#96:1:A>
Foreign exchange controls were untenable
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#97:1:A>
Raising taxes or cutting government expenditures would have led to
a deep recession
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#98:1:A>
It seemed like there was no way out
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#99:1:A>
But we found one anyway
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#100:1:A>
Substantial funds were located right under our noses the foreign
currency deposit <.> u </.> units or F C D Us so we borrowed from them on a
short term basis at relatively low cost
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#101:1:A>
As a result we brought down interest rates
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#102:1:A>
We brought down the inflation rate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#103:1:A>
And we strengthened the peso
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#104:1:A>
Experts say these all cannot happen at the same time because they
are inconsistent with one another
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#105:1:A>
But we did it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#106:1:A>
And we emerged out of the regional crisis ahead of most our of our
neighbors
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#107:1:A>
I narrate all these inside stories to make a point
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#108:1:A>
Those who make a career and a business out of hitting me are
saying that the improvement in the country 's economic performance was due to
pure luck to good weather or to anything but <indig> Erap </indig> <&> the
President 's nickname </&> <O> four sentences in Filipino </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#109:1:A>
Our recovery was due to the innovative way we analyzed situations
and made bold decisions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#110:1:A>
Our success was the result of effective governance
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#111:1:A>
It was a matter of having the right policies being supported by
competent and dedicated cabinet members respecting the freedom of the market
managing and budgeting our resource <.> ces </.> right and acting quickly
before the danger grew out or the opportunity disappear
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#112:1:A>
As a prominent Filipino economist Dr <.> Ber </.> Bernardo
Villegas recently wrote and I quote <quote> The economic team of the present
administration during its first year has been superior in cohesiveness
effectiveness and clarity in purpose when compared to the equivalent teams
during the first years of the previous administrations </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#113:1:A>
<X> With due respect to the President <,> Ramos I didn't say this
 </X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#114:1:A>
<quote> President Estrada 's first economic team is among the best
in Asia </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#115:1:A>
Effective governance by a team-powered administration also
explains the rapid recovery of the country 's international credit standing
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#116:1:A>
And I assure you that you know the definition of a banker
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#117:1:A>
He is a person who lends you his umbrella when it stops raining
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#118:1:A>
Credit markets are even more jittery
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#119:1:A>
So when the global market gobbles up one point two billion worth
of <.> Repub </.> worth of the Republic of the Philippines global bonds for
budget support from the first <.> ca </.> country to float such an issue
after the Asian crisis and when the market buys up the four hundred million
dollars of <indig> Bangko Sentral </indig> bonds issued for reserve
management purposes and when the Eurobond flotation of the national
government raises three hundred eighty-three million dollars obviously the
world believes that in the Philippines it has stopped raining
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#120:1:A>
We are getting a shower of umbrellas
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#121:1:A>
This is not to mention the billions of dollars of inflows in
medium and long term loans from bilateral sources banks and financial
institutions from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank from Japan 's
Export-Import bank and Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and from the
Monetary Fund among others <O> three sentences on lower unemployment figures
in Filipino interspersed with applause </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#122:1:A>
In the meantime our exports are zooming up at double-digit rates
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#123:1:A>
Our balance of current accounts are in surplus and our gross
international reserves are at all-time high currently amounting to fourteen
billion U S dollars
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#124:1:A>
With all these developments it is no wonder that in the space of
only one year the other Asian countries and indeed much of the world have
come to recognize the presidency of the Philippines as among the leaders of
the region
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#125:1:A>
This is indeed a long way from the skepticism that <.> greet </.> 
greeted this presidency when it began
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#126:1:A>
In APEC in ASEAN and in other regional international forums the
current leadership of the Philippines enjoys a high level of respect
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#127:1:A>
Our international prestige is on the rise
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#128:1:A>
The dramatic rebound in the stock market is a strong indication of
confidence and the people according to the latest surveys give the President
a seventy-seven point six percent approval rating
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#129:1:A>
The heads of the I M F and the World Bank also have a have had
good words to say
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#130:1:A>
Mr James Wolfenson president of the World Bank said and I quote
 <quote> What is clear is the Philippine situation is vastly different from
Korea Thailand and Indonesia
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#131:1:A>
<X> I think you all know you are weakened far less than anyone
else in the region with the exception of Singapore </quote> </X> end of quote
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#132:1:A>
And Mr Michel Camdessus managing director of the I M F said he
considered the Philippines as a model for countries in the ASEAN region
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#133:1:A>
Only last Thursday the I M F executive board completed the fourth
review under our standby arrangement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#134:1:A>
This will now allow us to draw about two hundred fourteen million
dollars which will further increase our gross international reserves
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#135:1:A>
The I M F executive directors also praised the <indig> Bangko
Sentral </indig> headed by Governor Gabriel Singson for the successful
implementation of monetary policy through the turbulence of the past two
years
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-026#136:1:A>
It is ironic that while foreign experts and the foreign press have
good reviews of our performance and while investors pour money into our
economy some quarters in our local media are undermining confidence in our
country </I>
