Okay I haven't really seen him

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#24:1:B>
But I think they 're really <indig> bagay </indig> what do you think

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#26:1:A>
Uhm I 'm not really sure <indig> pa </indig> but <&> break in the recording </&> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#27:1:B>
Anyway I had a bad thought
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#28:1:B>
I was at Bea 's house last night
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#29:1:B>
She <.> in </.> she invited me over to uh she uh she invited me to have dinner over at her house 'cause it was her <indig> lola 's </indig> birthday
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#30:1:B>
She even made me sing in front of her family

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#31:1:A>
Why didn't <,> she invite me

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#32:1:B>
Uhm because she realized sure that you can't make it <O> chuckle </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#33:1:A>
But anyway

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#34:1:B>
Anyway

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#35:1:A>
And then what happened

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#36:1:B>
<indig> Ay </indig> sorry

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#37:1:A>
It 's okay it 's okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#39:1:A>
What happened

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#40:1:B>
But anyway uh she she made <indig> kwento </indig> about Julio
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#41:1:B>
So they 've been dating for three months
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#42:1:B>
You know that

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#43:1:A>
Uhm <,> I uh well what I heard was she has a crush on him but not

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#44:1:B>
But you didn't know that <.> Ton </.> uh sorry Julio <,> like her dude

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#45:1:A>
No no no

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#46:1:B>
Really
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#47:1:B>
Anyway <,> so they 've been going out they 've been dating for three months and like they know that they like each other
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#48:1:B>
Uhm they confessed to each other already but the thing is uhm Bea I think she 's <.> fou </.> found out last night that I think she asked Julio if he was like okay he was if he was just fine with their relationship with what 's going on with them right now 'cause they 're like they 're <,> you can't say that they 're just friends 'cause they 're

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#51:1:A>
Already <{> <[> committed </[> with each other

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#52:1:B>
<[> Really </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#53:1:B>
Yeah they 're really close and like but you can't say that they 're lovers 'cause you know it 's so sad Tony is not uh sorry Julio
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#55:1:B>
Why do I keep mentioning that guy 's name I 'll forget him anyway
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#57:1:B>
Julio is not yet ready to commit
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#58:1:B>
What 's even more sad about it is that Bea

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#59:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#60:1:B>
Bea is ready I mean

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#62:1:A>
Julio is her her first guy I mean she hasn't had any boyfriend

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#64:1:B>
Yeah she haven't had any boyfriend
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#65:1:B>
Well Julio is not actually her boyfriend

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#66:1:A>
But

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#67:1:B>
Yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#68:1:A>
The one she 's willing to commit with

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#69:1:B>
<.> Ye </.> yeah
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#70:1:B>
And it 's so you know it 's so sad 'cause finally she 's done with her you know playing whatever she calls it games whatever with guys
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#75:1:B>
But <,> and now she 's finally ready to <,> have a commitment with a guy and

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#76:1:A>
And <unclear> word </unclear> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#77:1:B>
Yeah but I 'm sure <,> even though I don't know Julio that much I 'm quite sure that he really likes Bea a lot
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#78:1:B>
Maybe he 's just yeah scared

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#79:1:A>
So you think that 's what 's stopping him
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#80:1:A>
That 's it I mean he is just scared <{> <[> I mean not </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#82:1:B>
<[> Well <.> act </.> </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#83:1:B>
What what do you have to say

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#85:1:A>
I don't know 'cause if you just if you say that he 's just scared don't you think it 's a bit what lame
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#88:1:A>
Such a lame excuse to say that uh the guy is just afraid of committing or not yet ready
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#89:1:A>
I mean if you love someone you have to be willing to risk it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#90:1:B>
You know what you 're right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#92:1:B>
If <,> I don't know I just can't seem to blame this guy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#94:1:B>
I heard that he had a very bad break-up with his you know former girlfriend
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#95:1:B>
And like I think he left for States and uhm so he made <indig> paalam </indig> to the girl and then <,> the girl you know his former girlfriend

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#97:1:A>
His ex

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#98:1:B>
Yeah his ex uhm told him that it 's okay uh I 'll wait for you <{> <[> 'cause I really love you <indig> ganyan ganyan </indig> and all that stuff </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#99:1:A>
<[> <unclear> words </unclear> </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#100:1:B>
And like so the guy was like okay 'cause he was really in love with that girl and <,> when he came back from from States he found out that just a few months after he left the girl had a new guy

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#101:1:A>
Huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#102:1:B>
So okay

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#103:1:A>
Sad for him

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#104:1:B>
Yeah it 's so sad sad for him

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#106:1:A>
Oh yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#107:1:B>
So there you know

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#108:1:A>
So you think that 's his excuse

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#109:1:B>
Actually I haven't really talked to this guy so I 'm just assuming that it 's that 's his reason
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#111:1:B>
But you know it 's just so why do I keep on saying it 's sad well it is sad

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#114:1:A>
But I don't know I mean I 've met guys who like had bad break-ups and <{> <[> all </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#115:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#116:1:A>
But I mean to say that you 're afraid because of your past that you might do something wrong that whatever <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#117:1:B>
Well <{> <[> anyway </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#118:1:A>
<[> That 's </[> </{> not how love goes

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#119:1:B>
Yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#120:1:A>
That 's how I think

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#121:1:B>
Well we don't know their reasons so
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#122:1:B>
Would <,> let me just ask you what do you think about their relationship right now
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#124:1:B>
Like they go out they date uhm they 're more than friends they 're <,> you know <indig> parang </indig> M U <&> = mutual understanding </&> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#125:1:A>
Fun

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#126:1:B>
It 's actually more than that more than just M U <,> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#127:1:A>
Well <,> for me I think that I mean even if like she 's saying that she 's okay with that or they 're fine with that set-up I don't think that it is it 's enough
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#128:1:A>
I mean <{> <[> <,> </[> you if you really care for a person <,> you have to what be willing <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#129:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#133:1:B>
To risk

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#134:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#135:1:B>
To take the risk

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#136:1:A>
I mean even if you 're afraid I mean anything for love right

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#138:1:B>
That 's true
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#139:1:B>
Well <,> to some extent <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#140:1:A>
To some extent that 's true

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#141:1:B>
Yeah to some extent 'cause you know

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#142:1:A>
But still you have to know your levels
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#143:1:A>
<{> <[> But </[> still I mean what 's what 's to be afraid

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#144:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#145:1:A>
It sounds weird

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#146:1:B>
You know what
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#147:1:B>
Maybe you should talk to Bea give her a call or something

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#149:1:A>
Well yeah maybe I can do that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#150:1:B>
But she 's like <,> she 's so <.> e </.> you could see it in her eyes that she 's so happy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#151:1:B>
My gosh she talks about him every now and then every you know <indig> siya na 'yung buka ng bibig di ba </indig> <O> laughter </O> <&> break in the recording </&> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#153:1:A>
Speaking of <indig> buka ng bibig </indig> have you heard from Renee lately

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#154:1:B>
I was with her <indig> di ba </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#155:1:B>
We were in we were at the party but she didn't we didn't talk <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#156:1:A>
Have you heard of what happened to her I mean the crying scene and all

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#158:1:B>
Yeah I did but I don't know the whole story

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#159:1:A>
Uh so <{> <[> you don't know </[> about <,> Mike

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#160:1:B>
<[> Both of them </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#161:1:A>
I mean the story of Renee and Mike you know

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#162:1:B>
No no

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#163:1:A>
Uh okay

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#164:1:B>
Mike was with a girl that night

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#165:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#166:1:B>
I saw them <,> I I know that Mike liked that girl <{> <[> back in high school </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#167:1:A>
<[> Yeah that 's what </[> </{> I know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#168:1:A>
But the thing is you know I mean Renee had a crush on him since what since <,> I don't know I think a month ago a month or two ago

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#170:1:B>
Well anyway

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#171:1:A>
And then like one time <indig> kasi </indig> we talked right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#172:1:A>
And then like she tells me that she 's already in love with the <{> <[> guy </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#173:1:B>
<[> What </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#174:1:A>
I mean okay so you you you know him a month for a month
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#175:1:A>
How long have you been talking
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#176:1:A>
And then you love the person
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#177:1:A>
Don't you think it 's a bit weird

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#178:1:B>
Uhm I think she 's blinded <&> speaker A laughs </&> by the thought that being in love is good
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#180:1:B>
I mean it 's a good feeling so <,> initially she <.> ini </.> she 's in love with the thought

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#181:1:A>
Of love being

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#182:1:B>
Of finding someone to love

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#183:1:A>
Maybe

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#184:1:B>
You know

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#185:1:A>
Well anyway what 's funny about this is that she <unclear> word </unclear> at a guy who doesn't really like her <{> <[> okay </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#186:1:B>
<[> Ahhh </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#187:1:A>
Yeah I know it 's sad but it 's not a funny thing actually I 'm sorry

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#189:1:B>
It 's okay so

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#190:1:A>
So anyway what 's funny is last Saturday the guy was there and the guy Mike was there and I think <,> he was with this girl

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#191:1:B>
Sarah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#192:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#195:1:A>
So anyway when Renee saw this she 's like oh my God <O> laughter </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#196:1:B>
She was embarrassed

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#197:1:A>
Yeah she was she was and then <,> I don't know I mean her crush on him was a secret <,> right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#199:1:A>
And then what she cried in front of the people who she 's not really close to

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#201:1:B>
At the party

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#202:1:A>
Yeah she did she did

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#203:1:B>

Yeah <,> to Mike 's friends
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#217:1:A>
I mean she wasn't really close to that that 's what 's funny about it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#219:1:A>
It was a secret and then she cried she <{> <[> told them about it </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-081#221:1:B>
