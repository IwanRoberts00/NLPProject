<h> <bold> PCGG ready for showdown with Marcoses </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#2:1>
<bold> Christine Herrera </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#3:1>
<bold> AFTER 13 years, the Presidential Commission on Good
Government may finally be buckling down to serious work to prepare for the
<quote> &ldquo; biggest showdown &rdquo; </quote> with the Marcoses over the
wealth they had accumulated during the 20-year rule of their patriarch,
Ferdinand Marcos. </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#4:1>
The PCGG has hired five new lawyers to work full time to pursue
<quote> &ldquo; vigorously &rdquo; </quote> all cases against the Marcoses
and their cronies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#5:1>
The PCGG said yesterday that the pre-trial of all Marcos
ill-gotten wealth cases would start sometime this year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#6:1>
PCGG Commissioner Jorge Sarmiento said a new tack in pinning down
the Marcoses was being taken <quote> &ldquo; in the absence of any acceptable
agreement &rdquo; </quote> between the government and the Marcoses. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#7:1>
Sarmiento was referring to the 75-25 agreement being pushed by
President Estrada as the only way to recover the Marcos money. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#8:1>
But the PCGG said Malaca&ntilde;ang had also issued a directive to
pursue the cases since the government was <quote> &ldquo; confident of the
merits and strength of the forfeiture cases. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#9:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The hiring of experienced and seasoned lawyers is
meant to beef up the legal defense of the government, particularly in the
mother of all cases, Civil Case No. 0141 or Forfeiture Case, &rdquo; </quote>
Sarmiento told the <mention> INQUIRER </mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#10:1>
The forfeiture case would be the <quote> &ldquo; turning point,
&rdquo; </quote> Sarmiento said, in proving that the Marcoses <quote> &ldquo;
plundered" </quote> the economy during the strongman rule. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#11:1>
The PCGG tracked down the loot in two Swiss banks in the name of
six Marcos foundations and under the pseudonym of &ldquo; Jane Ryan &rdquo;
for Imelda Marcos and &ldquo; William Saunders &rdquo; for Ferdinand Marcos.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#12:1>
The Marcos accounts involving some &dollar;356 million in 1995
have since grown to &dollar;590 million as of Dec. 31, 1998 due to the
accrued interests. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#13:1>
The forfeiture case was filed seven years ago before the <indig>
Sandiganbayan </indig> . </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#14:1>
<h> <bold> 200 cases </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#15:1>
According to Sarmiento, the PCGG has 200 other ill-gotten wealth
cases filed against the Marcoses and the cronies since 1986 after the Edsa
Revolt. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#16:1>
All of these cases are pending in various courts and have yet to
reach the pre-trial stage after more than 12 years of litigation, he said.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#17:1>
Sarmiento attributed the delay to the lack of legal manpower.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#18:1>
Sarmiento said that the previous PCGG commissioners retained the
services of lawyers only on a part-time basis, including those recruited from
the Office of the Solicitor General. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#19:1>
This time, he said, the new lawyers will be concentrating on
nothing but the recovery of the Marcos assets with the collaboration of state
prosecutors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#20:1>
Sarmiento refused to divulge the lawyers ' identities to spare
them from possible pressures from interested parties. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#21:1>
<quote> &ldquo; With the help of the experienced lawyers that we 've
hired, we are optimistic that we can concentrate on fighting it out in
various courts, &rdquo; </quote> Sarmiento said.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#22:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Hopefully, we can now concentrate on handling the
pre-trial of the cases and win big for the government. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#23:1>
Sarmiento explained there was <quote> &ldquo; overwhelming
evidence &rdquo; </quote> for the government to win the cases. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#24:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The PCGG has been conducting a thorough review of
the cases filed against the Marcoses and their cronies, and the indications
are that the government will succeed in obtaining for itself favorable
decisions eventually, &rdquo; </quote> the PCGG statement noted. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#25:1>
<h> <bold> Escrow amount </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#26:1>
The money involved in the forfeiture case was remitted to the PNB
on April 16, 1998 pursuant to the escrow agreements signed between the PCGG
and the Philippine National Bank. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#27:1>
The validity of the escrow agreement has been upheld by the Swiss
Federal Supreme Court. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#28:1>
The PNB, in compliance with the Swiss high court 's decision,
invested the Marcos deposits in <quote> &ldquo; high-yield securities, bonds,
notes and precious metals &rdquo; </quote> in various investment houses with
&ldquo; AA &rdquo; rating in England, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Singapore and
the United States, Sarmiento had earlier told the <mention> INQUIRER
</mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#29:1>
The money, however, remained at the disposal of the Swiss
authorities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#30:1>
Sarmiento said the <quote> &ldquo; bottom line" </quote> in the
scheduled vigorous prosecution of the cases was to <quote> &ldquo; obtain
judgment" </quote> against the Marcoses to recover the &dollar;590 million in
Marcos deposits held in escrow at the Philippine National Bank. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#31:1>
While the escrow money was earning huge interest after it had
been invested in five foreign countries, Sarmiento said, the government could
not tap the money pending court judgment against the Marcoses. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#32:1>
<h> <bold> Why agreement stalled </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#33:1>
The agreement between the government and the Marcoses has been
stalled because the Supreme Court disallowed a settlement with the Marcoses
if it involved the dropping of criminal charges against the Marcoses and the
granting of immunity from suit and tax exemptions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#34:1>
The compromise would also violate the condition set by the Swiss
Federal Court that before the money could be touched, the Philippine
government must compensate the more than 10,000 human rights victims during
the Marcos dictatorship. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#35:1>
During negotiations with the Marcoses, it also became clear to
President Estrada that the Marcos heirs were not speaking with one voice.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#36:1>
While the Marcos children want an immediate settlement, Imelda
Marcos is intent on pursuing cases against her husband 's cronies, who had
allegedly been entrusted, according to her, with &peso;500-billion worth of
the Marcos assets. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#37:1>
The PCGG 's renewed commitment harks back to its original
mandate, which was to sequester and recover the Marcos loot and to file the
necessary criminal and civil cases against the dictator and his family and
associates. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#38:1>
Over the weekend, Makati Rep. Joker Arroyo, who was the executive
secretary when the PCGG was formed in 1986, proposed a formula on how to
recover the Marcos ill-gotten wealth: <quote> &ldquo; To prosecute the
Marcoses till kingdom come. &rdquo; </quote> </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Rigged biddings ' supplier exposes Napocor </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#40:2>
Jerry Esplana

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#41:2>
A SYNDICATE has been manipulating biddings for multimillion-peso
contracts at the National Power Corp. to favor multinational corporations
over Filipino firms, according to a Makati-based supplier of the state-run
firm. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#42:2>
Aside from the usual bribes, members of the syndicate got <quote>
&ldquo; free trips abroad with matching pocket money, sponsorships of wedding
banquets and Duty Free shopping sprees, &rdquo; </quote> among other perks
from some of those firms, it said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#43:2>
The disclosures were made by Renato Santos, president of R. V.
Santos Construction and Development Corp., a Makati City-based company and
one of the local suppliers of Napocor. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#44:2>
A high Napocor official confirmed the rigging of the bidding
process. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#45:2>
The official, who asked not to be named, said <quote> &ldquo;
people assigned to evaluate the bids can disqualify you anytime and you
cannot complain and recommend the awarding of the contract to another
company. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#46:2>
<quote> &ldquo; In most cases, &rdquo; </quote> the official
said, <quote> &ldquo; they rig the bidding process during the evaluation
stage. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#47:2>
The official added: <quote> &ldquo; It is sad because they always
have the final say.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#48:2>
That is why, if you are a supplier you have to be nice to them.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#49:2>
Another whistle-blower, also a local supplier of Napocor, said he
would also <quote> &ldquo; come out in the open and spill the beans &rdquo;
</quote> after he shall have consulted his lawyer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#50:2>
<quote> <indig> &ldquo; Tama na, sobra na </indig> ( Enough
already), Filipino companies are deliberately being eased out ( by the
Napocor syndicate), &rdquo; </quote> said the businessman, who asked not to
be identified. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#51:2>
The <mention> INQUIRER </mention> source said <quote> &ldquo;
biddings at Napocor were being conducted just to comply with the law, &rdquo;
</quote> a claim confirmed by Napocor insiders, including officers and
members of the Napocor Employees Consolidated Union. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#52:2>
In an unprecedented move, Santos expressed willingness to
cooperate with Malaca&ntilde;ang and the House of Representatives in their
investigation of reported bidding irregularities at the power firm. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#53:2>
At the same time, Santos appealed to President Estrada to <quote>
&ldquo; do something about the bidding irregularities at Napocor. &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#54:2>
<h> <bold> Erap 's order revoked </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#55:2>
In September, President Estrada formed an oversight committee to
ensure a graft-free bidding in the power company. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#56:2>
Mr. Estrada had earlier said he was seriously concerned about the
illegal activities of the Napocor syndicate. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#57:2>
But he was <quote> &ldquo; prevailed upon by proteges of ( former
Energy Minister) Geronimo Velasco to revoke the President 's memorandum (
late last year), &rdquo; </quote> a top Palace official said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#58:2>
The Malaca&ntilde;ang source was referring to Energy Secretary
Mario Tiaoqui, who is also Napocor chair, and Napocor president Federico
Puno. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#59:2>
Santos told the <mention> INQUIRER </mention> that his company
had won several biddings for power projects but <quote> &ldquo; lost some of
them to foreign companies favored by Napocor. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#60:2>
Santos cited, among others, Project 1159 for which <quote>
&ldquo; ( R. V. Santos Construction and Development Corp.) was the lowest
bidder at &dollar;28.7 million. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#61:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Some people in the bidding committee questioned
some minor technicalities in our bid.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#62:2>
Eventually, they awarded the contract to a foreign company with a bid
of &dollar;35 million, &rdquo; </quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#63:2>
The other bidders for Project 1159 included Hyundai (
&dollar;31.8 million), Hanil ( &dollar;31.9 million), Siemens ( &dollar;40.8
million), Asea Brown Boveri ( &dollar;42.4 million), Xiamen ( &dollar;44.1
million), GEC Malayan ( &dollar;46.1 million) and Holec ( &dollar;73.7
million). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#64:2>
In the bidding for Project 1121, Santos ' company was again the
lowest bidder in all three stages of the bidding. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#65:2>
<h> <bold> Pressure from above </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#66:2>
Santos said he got one of the biggest surprises of his life when
the Napocor bidding committee announced that it would give him only one
contract and award the other two to Xiamen and ABB. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#67:2>
<quote> &ldquo; And guess what they told me?

<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#68:2>
They said they had to distribute the other contracts to other
companies so everybody would be happy.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#69:2>
The engineering design manager, a certain Mr. Matulac, said they had
to do it because of pressure from above.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#70:2>
Of course, he didn't say who, &rdquo; </quote> Santos said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#71:2>
In Napocor Project 008, ABB got the contract with a bid of
&dollar;2.42 million although R. V. Santos offered the lowest bid of
&dollar;1.9 million. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#72:2>
A similar situation occurred in the bidding for Project 0100.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#73:2>
ABB bagged the contract with a bid of &dollar;286,000 although R. V.
Santos again submitted the lowest bid at &dollar;262,000. </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#75:3>
Donna S. Cueto and Lynda T. Jumilla

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#76:3>
THE GOVERNMENT has such <quote> &ldquo; overwhelming" </quote>
evidence against the Marcoses that it now expects to obtain a judgment of
forfeiture against them within the year, Solicitor General Ricardo Galvez
yesterday said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#77:3>
Starting this month, government lawyers will present the evidence
against the Marcoses on the main forfeiture case filed with the <indig>
Sandiganbayan </indig> , according to Galvez. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#78:3>
President Estrada said Tuesday the Marcoses could either forge a
settlement with the government or face forfeiture of their ill-gotten wealth.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#79:3>
Galvez said the anti-graft court had finally allowed the
government to present its evidence on Civil Case No. 0141 after a four-month
lull.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#80:3>
The last hearing was held in November. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#81:3>
<quote> &ldquo; We want to continue with the hearings.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#82:3>
We can finish this within the year if the <indig> Sandiganbayan
</indig> will allow us, &rdquo; </quote> he said in an interview. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#83:3>
But Galvez said the government could still settle amicably with
the Marcoses on the civil suit.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#84:3>
The case is open for settlement at any stage of the proceedings even
up to the point when the case is submitted for decision, according to the
government 's chief lawyer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#85:3>
The Presidential Commission on Good Government has hired five
top-notch lawyers to pursue with new vigor the forfeiture case.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#86:3>
This is part of the two-track approach of the Estrada administration
in recovering the ill-gotten wealth of the Marcoses. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#87:3>
The other is holding negotiations with the family for a possible
compromise agreement. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#88:3>
<h> <bold> List of evidence </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#89:3>
Galvez said he had submitted the government 's list of evidence
to the <indig> Sandiganbayan </indig> , including the income tax returns of
the late President Ferdinand Marcos, his wife Imelda and their children as
well as their admissions on the property that they own. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#90:3>
What government lawyers could do is just to compare the
discrepancies of the Marcoses ' income with their unexplained wealth,
including the &dollar;590 million held in escrow by the Philippine National
Bank. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#91:3>
The forfeiture case was filed in 1991 but it has been delayed by
the motions filed by the Marcoses, including their request to implement the
controversial 1993 compromise agreement which called for a 75-25 sharing in
favor of the government. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#92:3>
A motion to dismiss the forfeiture case was filed by the Marcoses
late last year. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#93:3>
<h> <bold> Public disclosure </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#94:3>
In the Senate, Malaca&ntilde;ang was asked yesterday to make
public the details of negotiations for a compromise on the ill-gotten wealth
of the Marcoses amid suspicions that the deal would favor the heirs of the
late strongman. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#95:3>
Senate Minority Leader Teofisto Guingona Jr. made the call in a
privilege speech in which he cautioned the government against entering into a
compromise <quote> &ldquo; unless legal and moral. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#96:3>
He also asked the Senate to look into the talks between the
Palace and the Marcos heirs to determine if the proposed deal would <quote>
&ldquo; bring justice to the nation. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#97:3>
<quote> &ldquo; There exists basic roadblocks to compromise,
roadblocks that are legal and moral, &rdquo; </quote> said Guingona, former
chair of the Commission on Audit. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#98:3>
He focused on two legal obstacles and left it to the government
and the people to determine the moral ones. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#99:3>
One legal obstacle to forging a deal with the Marcoses is the
family 's demand for immunity from prosecution in exchange for giving up a
portion of &ldquo; their &rdquo; assets. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#100:3>
<quote> &ldquo; The grant of immunity would seemingly not apply
to the Marcoses because they are the legal respondents in cases whose basic
purpose pursuant to law is to recover assets illegally acquired, &rdquo;
</quote> Guingona said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#101:3>
<quote> &ldquo; At most, settlement may only extinguish civil
liability, &rdquo; </quote> he said. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#102:3>
<h> <bold> Roadblock </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#103:3>
A second roadblock is the Marcoses ' demand for tax exemptions,
which according to Guingona, will be tantamount to giving the Marcoses
<quote> &ldquo; undue favor. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#104:3>
<quote> &ldquo; While Congress has the power to grant tax
exemption, especially so when it is to the public benefit or interest, the
exercise of such power to exempt is subject to the same general and specific
limitations imposed on the power to tax, &rdquo; </quote> Guingona said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#105:3>
Earlier, Sen. Raul Roco urged the government to call off the
negotiation with the Marcoses, saying nothing was coming out of it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#106:3>
Roco, co-chair of the Senate inquiry into Ms. Marcos ' claims of
ownership in several firms estimated at &peso;500 billion, said the
government should instead pursue the ill-gotten wealth and other cases
against the Marcos heirs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#107:3>
He said the two sides were nowhere near a settlement on the
recovery of the ill-gotten wealth.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#108:3>
Worse, he said, the Marcos family seemed to be the one dictating the
terms of the settlement. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-002#109:3>
Roco said aborting talks for a compromise settlement would take
some of the pressure off the government, especially on the matter of pursuing
the ill-gotten wealth cases. </p> </I>
