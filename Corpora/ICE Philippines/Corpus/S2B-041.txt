<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#3:1:A>
I 'd like to thank Atty Emmanuel Sales your faculty adviser for his kind and generous introduction
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#4:1:A>
The introduction was so well researched that it can only emanate from an associate justice of the Supreme Court <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#5:1:A>
Well uh <,> next time he files a petition I will remember the counsel for the petitioner Atty Emmanuel Sales <O> laughter </O> <O> clapping </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#6:1:A>
Well my friends I also recall having appeared before your Dean in nineteen eighty-nine
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#7:1:A>
And I had difficulty articulating my remarks at that time in nineteen eighty-nine in Cebu at the Cebu Plaza 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#> It was a PICPA National Convention and there was an overflowing crowd at the main ballroom of the Cebu Plaza and uh I had a hard time articulating and making myself understood because aside from the fact that the audience was fanning itself I also had to make do with the sound system that was barely heard by the audience because there was then a brownout in Cebu as it usually does <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#8:1:A>
Well my friends it is indeed a pleasure to speak before a select assembly of fellow La Sallites
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#9:1:A>
I say fellow La Sallites because during last Saturday 's commencement exercises I was conferred an honorary doctorate in management by your I mean our University which according to Brother President Rafael Donato made me an instant La Salle alumnus 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#10:1:A>
At the outset I wish to commend and congratulate the officers and members of the <foreign> Ley </foreign> La Salle for organizing and spearheading the ongoing fora which focus attention and elicit discussion on timely and paramount issues of the day
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#11:1:A>
I also wish to thank them for selecting a subject of vital concern to the nation and which I must admit is a topic close to my heart the administration of justice in the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#12:1:A>
Indeed the continuing dynamism of avenues of information and dialogue between the judiciary and our people is imperative if we are to sustain the momentum of reforms we have initiated in the past five years
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#13:1:A>
Our people must be made more aware of our resolve to bring to them a judicial system that effectively functions to safeguard their rights so that they may find enough reason to keep faith in our system of justice
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#14:1:A>
We must keep that faith alive for without it the very survival of the democratic institutions we have tried to rebuild in the aftermath of the former regime may be irreversibly prejudiced
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#15:1:A>
In this spirit let me then bring you closer to the arena of the Philippine judiciary
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#16:1:A>
I shall endeavor to guide you through the terrain of reforms we have explored in the past few years of my incumbency as principal steward of our judicial system
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#17:1:A>
Through the years the integrity of our judicial system as the haven of truth and the bulwark of equality before the law has been persistently questioned
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#18:1:A>
Our people increasingly confounded by laws they cannot seem to comprehend and court procedures that are as <?> fearfully </?> incomprehensible are unable to know how to protect the rights and liberties
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#19:1:A>
Worse the high cost of legal assistance and litigation the tortuously slow pace of court proceedings and the reality of corruption that has placed price tags on rights and liberties have further exacerbated our people 's alienation and sense of mistrust in our judicial system
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#20:1:A>
A people bereft of faith in the reality of truth justice and equality in society is like a dagger poised to strike at the very heart of our democracy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#21:1:A>
We had to reverse the tide of cynicism alienation and distrust
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#22:1:A>
Towards this end a blueprint for judicial reform was born
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#23:1:A>
Our end goal an independent moral and efficient judiciary
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#24:1:A>
I have brought the message of the Philippine judicial reform to every available forum here and abroad as my time and schedule permit
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#25:1:A>
In all my appearances in various parts of the country before lawyers judges and government organizations I have tried to impress the urgency of these reforms
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#26:1:A>
Allow me to share with you some of the recurring questions asked in these fora as a springboard of my discussion on the extent of reforms we have so far been able to initiate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#27:1:A>
What measures have been adopted to ensure that only qualified persons of proven integrity and competence are chosen as judges in our courts
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#28:1:A>
We have fully activated the Judicial and Bar Council a constitutionally mandated body composed of members of the judiciary and selected members of the bar to screen prospective appointees to judicial positions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#29:1:A>
Aside from extensive investigation and appraisal of qualifications the Council publishes the list of nominees to enable any citizen to question the fitness of those whose names are included in the list
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#30:1:A>
So if you feel a person is incompetent if you feel a person is dishonest or does not have does not possess integrity then feel free to object to his nomination by writing the Judicial and Bar Council
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#31:1:A>
Thereafter the Council draws up at least three names for each judicial office for submission to the President whose choice is limited to the list submitted
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#32:1:A>
Not only does the Council ensure that only those who are qualified are to be appointed the Council also ensures that the process of judicial appointment is insulated from the vagaries of political pressure and patronage
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#33:1:A>
Given the risk and paucity of remuneration for judicial officers what have we done to attract the best and the brightest into the judiciary
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#34:1:A>
For your information the lowest paid justices of the Supreme Court in Asia-Pacific region we just learned about it last week when we were in Perth Western Australia are the members of the Indian Supreme Court
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#35:1:A>
They receive only three hundred U S dollars a month three hundred which is even lower than our municipal trial court judge
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#36:1:A>
But the highest paid Supreme Court associate justice in the Asia-Pacific region are the justices of Singapore
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#37:1:A>
And they receive twenty-five thousand U S dollars per month plus a brand new Mercedes Benz plus the use of a government house plus free light <.> wa </.> water <foreign> etcetera etcetera </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#38:1:A>
See so and yet in spite of that not very many are attracted to join the judiciary because they make more money in the practice of law
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#39:1:A>
There are multitudes of qualified members of the bar who are sincerely committed to dedicate their talents to the judiciary
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#40:1:A>
But to fortify that commitment so that they can make the final leap into our court system there is the guarantee of security of tenure
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#41:1:A>
The Constitution proscribes the Martial Law practice of reorganizing the judiciary as it was done during the Marcos administration in a manner that prejudices the security of tenure of judges
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#42:1:A>
In addition we have also rationalized existing pay scales although we are still lagging behind all the many countries in the Asia-Pacific <.> re </.> region
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#43:1:A>
In addition we have also rationalized our existing pay scales and benefits so as to assure prospective judges of adequate remuneration
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#44:1:A>
Beyond these considerations are the irrevocable lures of rendering meaningful public service as well as the dignity and respectability that come with the position of a judicial officer
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#45:1:A>
Assuming we <.> ap </.> we appoint qualified judges to the bench how do we guarantee that they will perform creditably and efficiently
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#46:1:A>
With regard to newly appointed judges the Supreme Court conducts an orientation program composed of various seminars <.> to des </.> designed to equip new judges with court administration and decision writing skills 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#47:1:A>
As regards our existing crop of trial judges we have instituted a judicial career development program to update their knowledge of the law and upgrade their case and court management skills
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#48:1:A>
Parallel to our programs to enforce and instruct our judges is a continuing effort at sustaining the highest level of judicial discipline
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#49:1:A>
To this end the Supreme Court promulgated a code of judicial conduct which sets a framework of ethical standards that must be set by members of the judiciary 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#50:1:A>
Yet in this arena public support and the support of lawyers groups is vital if we are to completely eradicate misfits in the judiciary
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#51:1:A>
From nineteen eighty-three to nineteen eighty-five before we joined the Court while there was still an authoritarian government no R T C judge was dismissed from the service by way of administrative proceedings although many were eased out by way of reorganization
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#52:1:A>
Since nineteen eighty-six when I joined the Court thirty-four judges were admonished and warned nine judges have been reprimanded twenty-six imposed a fine one suspended and twelve dismissed from the service
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#53:1:A>
As for erring lawyers we have instituted a more systematic grievance procedure through appropriate amendments to the rules of court
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#54:1:A>
The new grievance procedure allows for erring lawyers to be investigated and disciplined by their peers in the Integrated Bar who after all are in a better position to assess the veracity of complaints against their fellow lawyers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#55:1:A>
In addition to and with the purpose of narrowing down the latitude of temptations for unscrupulous and irresponsible conduct the Supreme Court implemented a program for periodic visitation and performance evaluation of judges
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#56:1:A>
Tasked to administer the court performance monitoring system is the judicial planning and development implementing office headed by a former member of the board of trustees of De La Salle University Justice Cecilia Mu&ntilde;oz-Palma
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#57:1:A>
Now while we punish the erring judges we also reward the good ones those who perform excellently
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#58:1:A>
We commend them and at the same time we give them awards by way of this Judicial Excellence Award
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#59:1:A>
You know last June eleven we gave six judges special awards as outstanding judges three of them regional trial court judges and the other three metropolitan and municipal court trial court judges
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#60:1:A>
Aside from the awards and plaques that they received they we gave them fifty thousand pesos each
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#61:1:A>
In other words if you are a good judge and you are chosen an outstanding judge on a yearly basis you will receive a cash prize of fifty thousand pesos not given by the government or by the judicial funds but by the Judicial Excellence Foundation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#62:1:A>
But easily the most critical arena of concern is the problem of court delay and pathetically clogged court dockets
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#63:1:A>
We have been asked frequently what we have done to remedy these perennial afflictions of the judiciary
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#64:1:A>
All right first let us talk about the Supreme Court because you know after I assumed as Chief Justice the complaint of many is <,,> Chief my case has been pending for so many years until now it has not been resolved can we not speed up the judicial process 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#65:1:A>
So we had to look for ways and means to speed up the judicial process
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#66:1:A>
Well one possible explanation is there are just too many cases
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#67:1:A>
With a fast-growing population and not enough judges for the purpose it would be just well nigh impossible to dispose of these cases speedily as they come in fast
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#69:1:A>
Well anyway we have adopted certain reforms but first with respect to the Supreme Court
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#70:1:A>
For so many years the number of cases filed with the Supreme Court exceeded the number of cases disposed of by the Supreme Court
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#71:1:A>
So that every year the backlog kept on mounting <indig> ha </indig> at an alarming proportion as in a time will come when so many cases will be pending for ten or so years and they will not be disposed of
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#72:1:A>
So we had to redouble our efforts
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#73:1:A>
We had to engage the services of more researchers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#74:1:A>
We had to adopt measures like memorandum decisions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#75:1:A>
In other words don't make your decisions too long although that is the defect of many
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#76:1:A>
Each justice feels that every decision should be a <foreign> magnum opus </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#77:1:A>
It should not be that way uh
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#78:1:A>
A memo decision briefly a few pages would suffice as long as you state the facts the issues involved what is the law applicable and then the ruling of the Court
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#79:1:A>
So <,> working speedily and uh every day I used to hear the complaint of my associate justices but never mind if they are complaining anyway their production improved
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#80:1:A>
And in nineteen eighty-nine for the first time after so many years we were able to turn the tide
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#81:1:A>
And for the first time the number of cases filed <,> was below the number of cases disposed of
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#82:1:A>
In other words more cases were disposed of than the number of cases filed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#83:1:A>
This is the exact figure 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-041#84:1:A>
In nineteen eighty-nine the Supreme Court received five thousand four hundred ninety-four cases or an average of four hundred fifty-seven docketed per month then you divide that among fifteen justices
