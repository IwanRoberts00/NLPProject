<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#1:1:A>
<&> The Presiding Officer calls on the speaker </&> 
Mr Chief Justice Your Your Honors please <,> I 've never given much importance to an oath but all of us have taken our oaths
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#2:1:A>
Our Chair Congressman Belmonte has read the oath but I will read the oath again of the President <,> because it 's only now that I realize what this oath is all about
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#3:1:A>
When <.> Jos </.> when Joseph Ejercito Estrada took his oath high noon of June thirty nineteen ninety-eight he said <quote> I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully and conscientiously fulfill my duties as President of the Philippines preserve and defend its Constitution execute its laws give justice to every man and consecrate </quote> <&> break in recording </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#4:1:A>
In nineteen ninety-eight he promised the province of Ilocos Sur that he would release the monies that were <.> wilheld </.> withheld by President Ramos
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#5:1:A>
Then on June twenty-seven July twenty-seven nineteen ninety-eight when all of us listened to his State of the Nation Address he said that the nation is bankrupt <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#6:1:A>
But then here comes Governor Singson and tells the President Mr President could you make good the promise you gave to the people of Ilocos Sur 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#7:1:A>
The President said yes 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#8:1:A>
But he gave a condition
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#9:1:A>
What was that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#10:1:A>
He said that fifteen percent of all those monies that he would send to Ilocos Sur should go to him
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#11:1:A>
Now this was barely a month one and a half months after he took his oath and after he declared that the government was bankrupt
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#12:1:A>
But he provided money for Ilocos Sur
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#13:1:A>
So sometime in August he released through the budget two hundred million for Ilocos Sur
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#> Well and good
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#14:1:A>
But then comes Atong Ang Presidential adviser and tells the President and tells Governor Singson the President wants one hundred thirty million of the two hundred million 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#16:1:A>
Singson asked why 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#17:1:A>
He gave only two hundred why should I give one hundred thirty 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#18:1:A>
Atong Ang says that is the partial one hundred thirty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#19:1:A>
You will get some more 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#20:1:A>
So it is on that basis that <,> that prosecution will detail how the highest and supposedly the most exalted official of our nation systematically diverted the people 's money to himself and his family
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#21:1:A>
And we will show how it was what transpired 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#> And what we will show clearly indicates that the diversion of taxes to the President 's <.> pock </.> pocket was a planned and swiftly executed maneuver
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#23:1:A>
In fact the transaction was completed in less than three days
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#24:1:A>
Three individuals Delia Rajas Eleuterio Tan and Alma Alfaro acted as fronts and dummies
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#25:1:A>
They conspired with Atong Ang who was acting on the President 's behalf to divert to Mr Estrada one hundred thirty million originally intended to alleviate the plight of tobacco farmers of Ilocos Sur
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#26:1:A>
The manner in which these individuals accomplished was truly ingenious
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#27:1:A>
Let 's start the first day
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#28:1:A>
Thursday August twenty-seven nineteen ninety-eight check number zero nine six seven five zero for the amount of one hundred seventy million for the cash advance approved by the Provincial Board was released to Governor Singson
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#29:1:A>
Governor Singson authorized members of his staff Maricar Paz and <.> Mari </.> Marina Atendido to represent him in transactions with the Vigan branch of the Land Bank of the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#30:1:A>
From the one hundred and seventy million forty million went to the curing barn bar supplier while the one hundred thirty legitimate forty million while the one hundred thirty million that Atong asked went to the President and his family
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#31:1:A>
You may ask why
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#32:1:A>
How was this done
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#33:1:A>
Governor Singson instructed the Land Bank Vigan to remit to Land Bank Shaw Boulevard fifty million for the account of Delia Rajas forty million for the account of Eleuterio Tan forty million for the account of Alma Alfaro
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#34:1:A>
You ask the question
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#35:1:A>
How in the world can these private individuals become uh-uh should open accounts of public funds
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#36:1:A>
They 're private individuals <,> no connection with the government no connection with the tobacco industry but accounts were opened already on their behalf
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#37:1:A>
Now with undue haste Alma Alfaro tried to withdraw the forty million in cash on the same day or on August twenty seven nineteen ninety-eight but since the bank did not have the cash she was advised to go back the following day twenty-eight August
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#38:1:A>
Alfaro returned on that day and withdrew the forty million in cash at around ten A M
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#39:1:A>
Remember the forty million that 's already cash
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#40:1:A>
On August twenty-eight a Friday with extreme haste Eleuterio Tan withdrew the forty million
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#41:1:A>
With indecent haste Delia Rajas also withdrew the fifty million
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#42:1:A>
Then with the ninety million forty plus fifty-three cashier 's checks were purchased from Land Bank Shaw Boulevard payable to Eleuterio Tan
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#43:1:A>
Strange as it may seem on the same day August twenty-eight nineteen ninety-nine another person using the same name Eleuterio Tan opened a savings account this time with another bank Westmont Bank Mandaluyong branch under savings account number two zero one one zero zero seven seven two dash seven
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#44:1:A>
What must be emphasized if Your Honors please is that these two Eleuterio Tans had two different faces two different dates of birth two different addresses and two different specimen signatures
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#45:1:A>
Yet Eleuterio Tan number two had in his possession the same three cashier 's checks <.> pur </.> purchased by Eleuterio Tan number one and Delia Rajas
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#46:1:A>
So here is the money trail of what was originally public funds already messed up into private funds
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#47:1:A>
The next day Saturday and Sunday <indig> sana </indig> no transactions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#48:1:A>
The third working day August thirty-one Monday Eleuterio Tan number two deposited in his Westmont Bank Mandaluyong branch savings account the three cashier 's checks totaling ninety million which came came from Eleuterio Tan number one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#49:1:A>
The deposit was made at nine fifty-two A M
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#50:1:A>
For those around they could see the money trail clearly it 's all there
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#51:1:A>
On the same day in an unprecedented banking transaction the three cashier 's checks were encashed and the money was withdrawn from the Westmont Bank Mandaluyong branch
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#52:1:A>
These withdrawals were as follows twenty million at twelve thirty-two P M forty million at one fifty-five P M and thirty million at one at two forty-eight P M
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#53:1:A>
All in cold cash
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#54:1:A>
All in uh two hours
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#55:1:A>
After each withdrawal the money in thick bundles of crisp bills was brought to the nearby house of Atong Ang 's mother in Mandaluyong City where Governor Singson was waiting
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#56:1:A>
Atong Ang had even to involve his mother in this kind of transaction
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#57:1:A>
The brazen manner in which the President finally took custody of these public funds shows the depths of shame and disgrace to which that office has fallen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#58:1:A>
The prosecution will prove that from the house of Atong Ang 's mother Governor Singson together with the President 's intermediary Atong Ang brought the crispy bills totaling one hundred thirty million the ninety million withdrawn from Westmont Bank the forty million earlier drawn by Alma Alfaro from Land Bank Shaw Boulevard directly to the President 's home in one Polk Street North Greenhills
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#60:1:A>
At this juncture Your Honors please this one hundred thirty million is different from what Congressman uh Apostol said that 's <indig> jueteng </indig> money
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#61:1:A>
This one is tobacco money and these are public funds
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#63:1:A>
That 's why the seriousness of this how public funds <,,> got into the pocket of the President is something we we would request you to ponder very carefully
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#64:1:A>
After all both Governor Singson and Mr Ang were close friends of the President and could be trusted to be complicit partners in this transaction
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#65:1:A>
Governor Singson will reveal in detail what happened at the President 's house
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#66:1:A>
He will narrate how Mr Estrada scolded Atong Ang for giving part of the money to the First Lady and Presidential son Jinggoy Estrada
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#67:1:A>
Governor Singson will narrate how the President also berated Atong Ang for pocketing a portion of the funds for himself without the President 's knowledge and permission
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#68:1:A>
Governor Singson will also tell us that the First Lady even expressed her profound thanks to him for the millions of pesos she received
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#69:1:A>
Governor Singson will give us a first account of how public funds intended to alleviate the living conditions of our needy tobacco farmers in Ilocos Sur instead found their way into the pocket of a greedy President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#70:1:A>
This creative and bald-faced manner of diverting cash shows how the people 's money could be easily stolen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#71:1:A>
It couldn't be done no way unless they 've been under the instruction and under the auspices of the Office of the President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#74:1:A>
The amount is just so big <,> and the transaction so fast
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#75:1:A>
In three days public funds were converted into private funds
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#76:1:A>
In three days they were in from Vigan
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#77:1:A>
In three days they were in the pocket of the President of the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#78:1:A>
By authorizing the release of public funds with the clear and deliberate intention of ultimately appropriating these amounts for himself the President must account to the people he has sworn to serve and protect
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#79:1:A>
He is clearly unfit to lead
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#80:1:A>
He must go
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#81:1:A>
Article Two consists of two parts
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#82:1:A>
I 'll now proceed to the second part
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#83:1:A>
Article eleven Section seventeen of the nineteen eighty-seven Constitution provides that a public officer or employee shall upon assumption of office and as often thereafter as may be required by law submit a declaration under oath of his assets liabilities and net worth
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#84:1:A>
All of us here did that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#85:1:A>
All of them did it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#86:1:A>
Republic Act three zero one nine and six seven one three also require public officers to submit a sworn true and detailed statement of assets and liabilities including a statement of the amounts and sources of his income and financial and business interests
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#87:1:A>
On April twenty-nine nineteen ninety-nine and April twenty-eight two thousand President Joseph E Estrada filed his nineteen ninety-eight and ninety-nine statement of assets and liabilities respectively with disclosing under oath only his wife 's interests and financial connections in three corporations and making it appear that he himself has no interest and financial connection in any company
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#88:1:A>
In the course of the impeachment proceeding we will prove him wrong
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#89:1:A>
We will provide indisputable evidence that President Estrada lied under oath because he deviously concealed his interests and financial connections in the following corporations among others but not limited to <&> break in the recording </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#90:1:A>
St Peter <,,> St Peter Holding Company Dex Resources Company Hady States Holdings Company Verdant Resources Company F V C now V F C Wealthy and Development Company Valhalla Resources Company <?> Gelf </?> Real Estate and Development Company J E Films and Video One Corporation Erap Youth Erap Youth Muslim Foundation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#91:1:A>
We will prove that in July nineteen ninety-nine President Estrada through Presidential Counsel Edward <.> Serap </.> Serapio remember if Your Honors please remember this name because it may keep on recurring
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#93:1:A>
It was it was mentioned by uh Congressman Apostol in the <indig> jueteng </indig> thing now he is also involved here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#94:1:A>
He is the President 's personal lawyer 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#> Serapio caused the incorporation of St Peter 's Holdings and Dex Resources for the purpose of acquiring real property
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#95:1:A>
Now remember this under the Articles of Incorporation each of these corporations have identical stockholders identical directors identical incorporators
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#96:1:A>
All were partners and associates of President Estrada 's personal lawyer Edward Serapio
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#97:1:A>
All the companies also had the same office address the law office of Edward Serapio 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#98:1:A>
In addition they have the same authorized capital of one million and a mere paid-up capital of sixty-two thousand five hundred pesos
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#99:1:A>
Remember this <,> paid-up capital of sixty-two thousand five hundred
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#100:1:A>
We shall prove that on October one nineteen ninety-nine Jose Luis Yulo again remember this name a close friend of the President acquired all but four qualifying shares in St Peter 's Holdings and caused the increase in the paid-up capital of the corporation to two hundred fifty thousand
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#101:1:A>
Then as evident in a deed of sale dated October one nineteen ninety-nine which we 'll show in the impeachment proceeding St Peter 's Holdings purchased from Vicente and Gerardo Madrigal a seven thousand one hundred forty-nine square meter property in New Manila otherwise known as Boracay for eighty-six million
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#102:1:A>
Now pray tell me how can a corporation with a capital of fifty-two thousand five hundred acquire a property worth <,> eighty-six million
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#103:1:A>
By no stretch of imagination can Serapio ever say or even Jose Yulo say that <,> he capitalizes or his corporation has a paid-in capital of sixty-two thousand five hundred and he can buy a property from the Madrigals for eighty-six million
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#104:1:A>
Now we shall also prove that St Peter 's Holding paid the eighty-six million with a B P I cashier 's check and more which St Peter 's Holdings purchased using funds from his newly opened account in B P I
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#105:1:A>
We shall show that St Peter 's account was funded from Jose Luis Yulo 's personal account in B P I and that Jose Luis Yulo 's account personal account in B P I <,> turned was in turn funded with check number zero one one zero seven one four nine five one issued by a person whose signature appears on the screen <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#106:1:A>
We want you to see this signature
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#107:1:A>
Study very closely
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#108:1:A>
You 'll notice look at the lower portion which has an arrow
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#109:1:A>
Look at the signature
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#110:1:A>
Examine it carefully
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#111:1:A>
It purports
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#112:1:A>
Then look at the signature of the President in a five hundred peso bill which is on top
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#113:1:A>
You need not be an expert to see the similarity
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-063#114:1:A>
The name may be different but there are unmistakable signs that <,> the signature in that check is the signature of the handwriting of the President of the Philippines
