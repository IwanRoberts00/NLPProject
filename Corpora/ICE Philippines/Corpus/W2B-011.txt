LAST Feb. 2,1998, Philippine stocks posted the biggest gain in
seven years.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#4:1>
The surge was seen all over Asia.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#5:1>
Then the market dampened a few days later. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#8:1>
The Asian crisis is not going away this year or next year.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#9:1>
This seems to be the mainstream thought in the annual World Economic
Forum in Davos, Switzerland. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#10:1>
Much of this analysis is taken from <mention> Newsweek 's

Tens of millions of jobs in Asia are at stake.

But there is more. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#20:1>
The crisis seems foreign to Europe which is busy with its plans
for monetary union.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#21:1>
Companies are pushed into becoming more competitive because of it.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#22:1>
The advent of the <foreign> Euro </foreign> has lowered interest
rates across Europe, and that has energized growth. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#23:1>
On the minus side, Europe has to deal with its high unemployment
and its unwieldy welfare system. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#24:1>
The <mention> Asian flu </mention> is also less urgent for the
United States, which is enjoying glowing economic figures.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#25:1>
The US budget is balanced, interest rates are low and dropping, and
consumer spending is healthy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#26:1>
But the United States is aware that the crisis can wash upon its
shores.

<quote> &ldquo; Asian financial instability ( is still a threat) to

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#28:1>
Trouble looms if Asian countries default on their foreign debts,
made heavier by the devaluations.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#29:1>
Defaults could bring down banks all over the world and plunge the
globe into depression. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#30:1>
Two countries bear special attention.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#31:1>
Developments there may determine the future of the Asian crisis.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#32:1>
Will it be contained or will it spread across the globe? </p>

<h> Japan 's Big Bang </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#36:1>
Because of the devaluations around Asia, these countries must go
full blast with exports.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#37:1>
So they need markets besides the US and Europe.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#38:1>
Japan can supply this critical need as she is the second-largest
economy in the world. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#39:1>
Japan is Asia 's prime saver, for the nation has accumulated a
huge hoard of foreign exchange overtime: &dollar;12 trillion in savings.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#40:1>
It supplies half the net savings needed by borrowers round the world.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#41:1>
Japan can use its savings to buy goods from the rest of Asia and
thus prime the pump of growth.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#42:1>
However, the Bank of Tokyo reports that Japan 's economy is stagnant.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#43:1>
The 1990s have been called the one percent decade because of the low
growth rate. </p>

<quote> &ldquo; We are very rich, but we don't know how to use
our money, &rdquo; </quote> notes Kiichi Miyazawa, former Japanese Prime
Minister. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#45:1>
The Japanese brand of capitalism is noted for social harmony, and
protecting the main instruments of that harmony, the banks. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#46:1>
It 's like this.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#47:1>
In the ' 70s and ' 80s Japan dumped its cheap exports abroad while
limiting its imports.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#48:1>
That built up huge reservoirs of capital.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#49:1>
Much of the money went abroad in the form of notoriously cheap
credit. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#50:1>
Thus arose the building spree across Southeast Asia.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#51:1>
Lenders lent recklessly and borrowers borrowed recklessly.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#52:1>
Overcapacity resulted, triggering the business failure in Thailand.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#53:1>
Back in Japan, cheap credit allowed companies to maintain
unproductive workers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#54:1>
That 's why the unemployment rate is a rather low 3.5 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#55:1>
Because they serve as social stabilizers, banks are allowed to keep
accumulating much capital.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#56:1>
So while they hold tremendous assets, they show the lowest return on
equity in the world. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#57:1>
The fattened banks are as big as <foreign> Sumo </foreign>
wrestlers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#58:1>
Sumitomo Bank 's assets alone equal South Korea 's gross domestic
product.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#59:1>
The fear is that one of those giants may collapse, hence the Ministry
of Finance rushes to rescue the ailing ones.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#60:1>
But that coddling leads to imprudent investment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#61:1>
Japan needs to turn its financial system, bolster domestic
demand, and open its markets more. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#62:1>
IMF officials have said quietly that Japan 's refusal to change
may post the most serious threat to the world economy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#63:1>
The government plans to liberalize the financial sector by April,
a move nicknamed <mention> the Big Bang </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#64:1>
It will open up Japan 's securities, brokerages and asset markets.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#65:1>

international standards. </p>

<h> Trigger Indonesia </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#69:1>
Another crucial actor is Indonesia, whose turbulent currency has
rocked markets all over the world.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#70:1>
Whenever its market drops, so does the rest of Asia. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#71:1>
Stability is important for Indonesia, a powderkeg of 190 million
people.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#72:1>
This will require obedience to the rigid reform package imposed by
the International Monetary Fund. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#73:1>
Towing the IMF line will be difficult.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#74:1>
President Suharto signed an agreement with the IMF in January but
declared that he will run for a seventh 5-year term.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#75:1>
One wonders if that will prolong the corruption that mars the First
Family which controls major chunks of the economy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#76:1>
Then there 's the concern that President Suharto is ailing.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#77:1>
Suharto hinted that B. J. Habibie will be his successor.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#78:1>
Habibie is not well regarded by the Western financial community, so
the announcement rocked markets across the globe. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#79:1>
Adding to Indonesia 's woes is the drought caused by <mention>
<foreign> El Ni&ntilde;o </foreign> </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#80:1>
That can foment social unrest. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#81:1>
Indonesia 's crisis is very deep.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#82:1>
Earlier on she had suffered a devaluation equal to our peso falling
to 100 per dollar.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#83:1>
Jakarta estimates that some one million Indonesians will be thrown
out of work in 1998. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#84:1>
Certain foreign banks have given up on the hope of being repaid
in dollars.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#85:1>
They are accepting payment in <foreign> rupiah </foreign> rather than
in dollars. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#86:1>
Noting that the <foreign> rupiah </foreign> has depreciated 80
percent in its value, Moody 's Investors Services, a rating agency, stated
that firms are finding it hard to service their foreign currency debt.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#87:1>
Jakarta said that around 220 local companies were in danger of
defaulting. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#88:1>
A senior IMF official reported that some corporations were
already defaulting. </p> </I>

Lately we have been pretending to have been overwhelmed by an

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#93:2>
To be sure, the current crisis is entirely man-made.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#94:2>

Asia is abundant in clothing.

Housing materials are in the stocks.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#98:2>
We still have the material and human resources to educate and
entertain ourselves.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#99:2>
We are still secure from natural calamities.

In fact, lately, there have been nearly none that visited the

Our security problem comes from criminality; but that again is

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#103:2>
This crisis is artificial.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#104:2>
It is fed by greed.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#105:2>
The bounty of Asia is not yet equitably distributed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#106:2>
The situation does not get better when some would desire to
possess more of its finances.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#107:2>
Ours is not a problem of generating wealth but of distributing it.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#108:2>
Some would want more, leaving others with less. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#109:2>
The financial crisis is rooted in the desire to partake of more
money in circulation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#110:2>
Philanthropy is indeed the art of giving away publicly what one

A rebirth of central planning might just come about.

His alleged sudden withdrawal of investments from Asia after Asean
admitted Burma, effected falls in Wall Street and dampened sales of European
goods. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#128:2>
Another theory says the West wants Asia to remain as a food
basin.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#129:2>
It wants Asia to be weak.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#130:2>
But the Westerners cannot put down Asia without the US and Europe
crashing with it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#131:2>
What lessons do we learn?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#132:2>
One: Rethink globalization.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#133:2>
Think Asia.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#134:2>
Two: Lessen dependence on the dollar.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#135:2>
Three: Asia must have an internally dynamic economy.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#136:2>
Four: Foreign divestment can be a sword of Damocles; hence we must
not pin our hopes on Western money.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#137:2>
Fifth: we should not take too much even if we have the chance.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#138:2>
Let others live decently. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#139:2>
The currency crisis will only make Asia learn its lesson well

<h> <bold> Kawit and Malolos: Lessons for the 21st century </bold>
</h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#141:3>
<bold> Pablo S. Trillana III </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#142:3>
<bold> TODAY </bold> we celebrate the centennial of the First
Philippine Republic.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#143:3>
In all of colonized Asia, it was the Filipinos who first gave flesh
to the ideal of freedom by declaring independence in Kawit on June 12, 1898
and establishing a constitutional republic in Malolos seven months later.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#144:3>
The Filipinos were thus the forerunners of the freedom movement in
Asia.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#145:3>
As such, the Kawit proclamation and the Malolos Republic--pivotal
links in the progressive chain of events that brought us to where we are
today--could well be the focal point of the Centennial celebrations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#146:3>
Still there is a compelling reason to be concerned.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#147:3>
It is not only that controversy still surrounds the arrest and death
of Andres Bonifacio, the Father of the Revolution, upon orders or with the
consent of Emilio Aguinaldo, the Father of the Republic.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#148:3>
It has much to do also with the seeming perception that their
tragically interconnected lives directed the passage of the country for the
succeeding 100 years into opposite and contrary horizons. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#149:3>
The worrisome thing about Kawit and Malolos is that they may
keep us focused on the trappings of statehood just as they did 100 years ago,
without allowing us to sort out the moral underpinnings of nationhood.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#150:3>
They may keep us off-balance and divert our national consciousness
from the full import of the Rizal-Bonifacio-Mabini vision for a moral nation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#151:3>
They may devour us just as Tejeros and <indig> Biak-na-Bato </indig>
sucked us into a vortex of <foreign> <it> rigodon </it> </foreign> politics,
which we now fondly call <mention> <indig> &ldquo; <it> Kalayaan </it>
&rdquo; </indig> . </mention> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#152:3>
There is a world of difference between statehood ( <indig> <it>
bansa </it> </indig> ) and nationhood ( <indig> <it> bayan </it> </indig> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#153:3>
Statehood establishes the institutional infrastructure of command;
nationhood generates the organizing spirit of rule.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#154:3>
Statehood builds the bureaucracy, foreign relations, roads, schools,
communications, the emblems of government; nationhood develops the bond, the
grit, the verve, the temper, the energy, the soul of governance.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#155:3>
Statehood is a modality of power; nationhood is the morality of
power. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#156:3>
Jose Rizal hinted at a further distinction when he said: <quote>
&ldquo; I have always loved my country and wished for her moral and material
development. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#157:3>
Statehood develops the materials of society; nationhood nurtures the
morals of the community.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#158:3>
Statehood emphasizes the external; nationhood, the internal. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#159:3>
To confuse statehood and nationhood then is to miss completely
the point of what Rizal and Bonifacio died for.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#160:3>
Rizal fought not only to give birth to a state but to a moral nation
and died at the hands of those who would maintain a foreign state 's royal
control over a nascent nation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#161:3>
Bonifacio fought not only to drive the Spaniards home but to build a
nation of &ldquo; <indig> <it> mga kapatid </it> </indig> &ldquo; steeped in
the practice of brotherly love.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#162:3>
He died at the hands of those who would establish an indigenous
sovereign state to control a newborn nation in order to maintain political
and economic power. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#163:3>
It was a tragic case of state versus nation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#164:3>
To miss this point is to condemn ourselves to make the same mistakes
of history over and over again.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#165:3>
The greater mistake, however, is to fail to see that the
requirements of state and nation are not contradictory.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#166:3>
They are interdependent and complementary.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#167:3>
Taking stock of the last 100 years of our history should be an
exercise in refocusing our directions and efforts not only on the external
and the material but also on the internal and the moral.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#168:3>
Both are important in the equation of the nation-state. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#169:3>
It is necessary to cultivate what Rizal, Bonifacio and Mabini
prescribed for the nurturing of our nationhood: a strong and solid moral
foundation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#170:3>
Anchored on Rizal 's overarching idea of education, reinforced by
Bonifacio 's insistence on &ldquo; <indig> <it> mahal at magandang ugali ng
ating bayan </it> </indig> &ldquo; and distinguished by Mabini 's dream of a
country marked with &ldquo; virtue, &rdquo; the complete revolution had to be
a harmonious reconciliation between the forces of state, which Aguinaldo
commanded, and the moral interests of the nation, which Rizal, Bonifacio, and
Mabini demanded.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#171:3>
To borrow Adib Majul 's description of Mabini 's revolutionary
ideology, <quote> &ldquo; the revolution was to be both a technique for the
attainment of independence and a process for the moral development of a
people. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#172:3>
In this sense, Rizal, Bonifacio, Mabini and Aguinaldo are not
antithetical ideologists.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#173:3>
They are complementary heroes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#174:3>
How do we cultivate the moral fiber of the people to achieve
this dynamic balance between the concerns of statehood and nationhood?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#175:3>
Among other things, by projecting in the clearest light possible the
compelling <foreign> persona </foreign> of <indig> <it> Inang Bayan </it>
</indig> , engaging the attention of a critical mass of people to focus on
her message that we are, at the very heart of all state concerns for
political, economic and military governance, also <indig> <it> Mga Anak ng
Bayan </it> </indig> , whose equally foremost duty is to unite in a national
solidarity of honor and dignity-- <indig> <it> ang Katipunang Kagalang-galang

One hundred years ago, the medium of engaging the attention of a
critical mass of people through satire and <foreign> <it> comedia </it>
</foreign> entertainment was the <foreign> <it> nobela </it> </foreign> and
the <foreign> <it> zarzuela </it> </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#177:3>
Today, the medium of grabbing such mass attention and of reorienting
our people 's values and attitudes--by satirizing the colonizer 's language
and usages--seems to be the <foreign> <it> pelikula </it> </foreign> .

Erap has <it> Famas </it> - ly harnessed it, rubbing the same on
elitist <foreign> ilustrado </foreign> noses to trim them down to the proper
<indig> <it> pagka-pango--masyado na kasing tumangos ang mga ilong ng ating
mga kababayan sa ka-iingles at natakpan na ng katangusang ito ang kanilang
pananaw sa lupang tinubuan at tinatayuan </it> </indig> . </p>

Looking back at the harried pageantry of statehood on June 12,
1898 and Jan. 23, 1899, and seeing how they deflected us from the full
founding vision of <indig> <it> Inang Bayan </it> </indig> ( coming as they
did on the heels of the Maragondon executions), can we now set our sights not
only on sovereignty but also on sobriety and gaze with humility on what lies
ahead of us as a people?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#180:3>
Can we now, under the direction of one honed in the art and
technique of transforming masses of movie spectators into motivated actors of
political change, train our spotlights on <indig> <it> Inang Bayan </it>
</indig> in the theater of <indig> <it> Kasaysayan </it> </indig> so that the
obsession with power and statehood now segues definitively into the
Rizal-Bonifacio-Mabini vision of a model <indig> <it> sambayanan </it>
</indig> , braiding together the demands of the state and the nation and
healing our land at last? </p>

It is high time we sang and lived the <indig> Katipunan </indig>
national anthem-- <quote> <indig> <it> &ldquo; Mabuhay, mabuhay ang
kalayaan/Pasulungin ang puri't kabanalan! &rdquo; </it> </indig> </quote> as
a lesson and a call for the next century.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-011#182:3>
The ideals and sacrifices of 100 years ago demand no less from us.
