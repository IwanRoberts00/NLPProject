<h> <bold> Wrap your imagination </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#3:1>
<bold> THE WAY </bold> you wrap gifts actually increases their
value.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#4:1>
But you don't have to spend &peso;200 to buy a box and trimmings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#5:1>
All you need is imagination, says Rachy Cuna, Metropolitan Museum
consultant.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#6:1>
Forget cellophane and silk satin ribbons.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#7:1>
<indig> <it> Sinamay </it> </indig> is the in thing for wrapping
gifts, whether the material is used as wrapper or ribbon. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#8:1>
Divisoria is Cuna 's favorite source of materials--for pines,
baskets, lace, bells, fans, birds, ribbons, miniature wheels, miniature
<indig> <it> bayong </it> </indig> , <indig> <it> sinamay </it> </indig> in
bright colors or with metallic threads, boa feathers, miniature fruits and
flowers, beads and <foreign> faux </foreign> pearls. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#9:1>
A blow gun and glue pellets, available in hardware and craft
stores, are also needed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#10:1>
The hardware section also offers nontraditional wrappers such as
colored screens which make nifty wrappers.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#11:1>
Ask friends who do wallpaper to give you remnants. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#12:1>
For drama, if you 're attending a big function where you have to
lug your gifts, wrap them up in the same color and wear an outfit that
matches it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#13:1>
It 's fun to wrap the presents according to the receiver 's
personality, says Cuna. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#14:1>
Tie a <indig> <it> tampipi </it> </indig> with dried water lily
stalks instead of the usual ribbon.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#15:1>
Add plastic cranberries as accents.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#16:1>
A red <indig> <it> tampipi </it> </indig> goes well with a <indig>
capiz </indig> star. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#17:1>
For the person who loves to cook, wrap braided garlic in gold
tinsel and use a tulle veil as dramatic accent.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#18:1>
Braided garlic also looks good with a red feather boa wound on top,
accented by gold tinsel. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#19:1>
<foreign> <it> Queso de bola </it> </foreign> can be wrapped with
glazed paper, and studded with anise stars. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#20:1>
Fruitcakes can be packaged in little <indig> <it> bayong </it>
</indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#21:1>
Highlight a cookbook by adorning the wrapper with dried bay
leaves. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#22:1>
To pack local <foreign> delicatessen </foreign> such as special
rice, put it in a dried gourd flask, available in Baguio, and accessorize
with gold <indig> <it> sinamay </it> </indig> ribbon.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#23:1>
Add dried <indig> <it> palay </it> </indig> stalks for accent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#24:1>
<indig> <it> Itlog na maalat </it> </indig> can be packaged in an
<indig> abaca </indig> <foreign> fez </foreign> and wrapped with tulle and
handmade ribbon with tiny Christmas balls. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#25:1>
Cuna gives his vegetarian friends boxes adorned with fresh
chillies or garden vegetables. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#26:1>
For the sweet tooth, pack cookies and cakes in <indig> <it>
sinamay </it> </indig> boxes.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#27:1>
Top them with surplus Christmas decor such as <indig> <it> sinamay
</it> </indig> angels, or put them in bird cages tied up with copper wire.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#28:1>
For the nun or grandmother, get a <foreign> celadon </foreign>
glazed vase with lilies and Australian wild grass.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#29:1>
Tie dyed raffia around the vase and finish with gold berries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#30:1>
The contents of Filipiniana gifts can be highlighted with
handmade paper.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#31:1>
Use a blowgun to spread feathers around it, or paste <indig> abaca
</indig> stars on it and tie with a gold chain. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#32:1>
For the traditional woman, use a grass box and enliven it with a
miniature poinsettia and gold ribbon. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#33:1>
Small bamboo steamers make interesting jewel boxes.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#34:1>
Tie them up with gold tinsel and add an <indig> abaca </indig> star.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#35:1>
Or, get a <indig> <it> bayong </it> </indig> and dot it with red
balls and wrap it with hollies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#36:1>
For the sophisticated woman, put the gift in a large bowl and
cover the bowl with pink and magenta tulle.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#37:1>
Tie the ends of the tulle and catch them with gold pine, cypress and
<indig> <it> agoho </it> </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#38:1>
For accent, cover with gold beads. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#39:1>
For someone sweet, wrap the gift in pastel paper and paste a
spiral out of handmade paper ribbon.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#40:1>
Add a dash of fresh flowers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#41:1>
There are many ways to package liquors.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#42:1>
You can put them in cylindrical baskets found in trade fairs and wrap
them with <indig> coco </indig> leaf ribbons, gold wire and gold poinsettia.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#43:1>
For the yuppie, use the rubber mat for draining dishes to wrap
the liquor bottle and tie it up with electrical wire. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#44:1>
An <indig> abaca </indig> doormat in strong colors is suitable
for wine bottles.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#45:1>
Tie them up with tinsel. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#46:1>
For the child, use a <indig> <it> moras </it> </indig> teddy
bear, available in Divisoria, instead of a ribbon. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#47:1>
For the boss, wrap your gift in mottled handmade paper and cover
with gilt <indig> <it> sinamay </it> </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#48:1>
Or, use plain <indig> abaca </indig> as the second wrapper and accent
it with dried twigs. </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#49:2>
<h> <bold> Look around, then choose your line of small enterprise
</bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#50:2>
<bold> Dennis M. Arroyo </bold> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#51:2>
<bold> THERE 'S </bold> this exemplary taxi driver I read about
somewhere.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#52:2>
He 's dressed impeccably like a true professional.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#53:2>
The interior of the cab is sparkling.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#54:2>
When you get in, he offers you a choice of newspaper to read.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#55:2>
Even some soft drinks--and they are all free.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#56:2>
Then when you reach your destination, he opens the door for you. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#57:2>
How can he afford the free newspaper and the drinks?

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#58:2>
The guy makes a killing on tips.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#59:2>
Now that 's an example of excellence in a small business.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#60:2>
It was all superbly planned. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#61:2>
This article will provide some advice for those venturing out on
their own small enterprises.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#62:2>
We start with how to choose your particular business.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#63:2>
The principles were largely drawn from a book by the Small
Enterprises Research & Development Foundation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#64:2>
To start, what is your general line of business? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#65:2>
You may want to go into manufacturing products.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#66:2>
These may be for the mass market or for specialized demand.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#67:2>
Mass goods include items like T-shirts and bottled water.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#68:2>
Specialized products may be those that cater to doctors, dentists,
lawyers, journalists.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#69:2>
Imagine the fortune to be made by a pocket laser that can change the
traffic light. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#70:2>
You may want the process industries.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#71:2>
That is, you handle one or two stages of the entire manufacturing
process, not the entire chain.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#72:2>
For example, you can focus on cutting, welding or milling.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#73:2>
Or you may want to handle packaging and canning. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#74:2>
Another option is to be a subcontractor.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#75:2>
Large companies subcontract specialized work to the smaller fry
partly because their capacity is much too big for the task.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#76:2>
Or they do not have the expertise for such activities.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#77:2>
It may also be faster and cheaper for them to delegate that work.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#78:2>
However, there is a danger of becoming too dependent on one major
client. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#79:2>
Then another viable option is to go into services.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#80:2>
There are more service enterprises among the small industries than
manufacturing outfits.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#81:2>
Many services can be conducted from the home, and they appeal to
talented types. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#82:2>
The major fuel is creativity.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#83:2>
For example, a high school senior may have a part-time job talking to
teens to find out what 's in and out fashion-wise.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#84:2>
The information will prove useful for department stores. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#85:2>
Services have been stereotyped as being performed by individuals
for individuals.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#86:2>
That is not necessarily so.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#87:2>
Through technology, machines get to serve customers with minimum
human contact.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#88:2>
( Think of the ATMs, notwithstanding jokes about the hidden midgets.)
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#89:2>
<h> <bold> Generating business ideas </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#90:2>
Then, how do you get many ideas for your enterprise? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#91:2>
First ask what skills you have picked up with experience.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#92:2>
Many times have small businesses emerged from talents developed in
previous jobs.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#93:2>
Executives have often ventured into management consultancy as a
result of accumulated years in the office. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#94:2>
Then again, you may excel in a particular passion or hobby
unrelated to your former jobs.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#95:2>
If you feel you are the authority on research via the Internet, you
may want to cash in on that skill. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#96:2>
Another tack is to look at the data on imports.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#97:2>
What goods does the Philippines still import which can be
manufactured locally?

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#98:2>
If you can produce them at lower cost then you have quite an edge.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#99:2>
Devaluation has made imports more prohibitive and the trend may last
long.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#100:2>
Besides, you can always alter your product to make it more suitable
to local demand.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#101:2>
Foreign manufacturers can't easily do this. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#102:2>
A third way is to read up on new technologies.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#103:2>
Check them out in <mention> TIME </mention> , <mention> Newsweek
</mention> , or <mention> Discover </mention> magazine.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#104:2>
Better yet, use the Internet 's search engine for getting the latest
technologies.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#105:2>
You can be the first to introduce a particular technology here, and
that translates into a temporary monopoly advantage. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#106:2>
Fourth, take a look of the product lines encouraged in the
latest official investment priorities plan.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#107:2>
These are often pioneer areas or those with few producers competing
among themselves. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#108:2>
Fifth, check social trends.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#109:2>
If reading the business pages won't suffice, you may want to look at
official data, or those of <mention> Social Weather Stations </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#110:2>
For example, Metro Manila traffic will get heavier before it is
relieved by the new light rail transit.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#111:2>
What products will ease the purgatory of the daily driver or
commuter? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#112:2>
Incidentally, enterprising Indonesians cashed in on a traffic
ordinance that there must be more than one person in a car.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#113:2>
Street children would look for cars with solo drivers then get money
for hitching with them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#114:2>
A sixth way is simply to have a brainstorming session with your
friends.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#115:2>
Over a round of beer, get their opinions on what new services can
arise.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#116:2>
What needs have not been met?

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#117:2>
How can some current products and services be improved? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#118:2>
Wild but viable ideas may arise.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#119:2>
In the US, some actors hire themselves out to supermarkets.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#120:2>
They pretend to shoplift, are &ldquo; caught &rdquo; by the security
guards, and hauled away.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#121:2>
The commotion and embarrassment deter would-be shoplifters. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#122:2>
What are the capital requirements?

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#123:2>
If the needed funding is the size of Godzilla, then think twice.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#124:2>
The size of the loan does matter in these days of high interest
rates. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#125:2>
What is the rate of return on investment?

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#126:2>
Some enterprises may yield such meager fruit that they may not be
worth the effort. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#127:2>
Do you really have the training and liking for the project?

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#128:2>
If it 's far from your heart, you will eventually slacken and the
business may go belly-up. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#129:2>
<h> <bold> Planned expansion </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#130:2>
Then dream about the growth of the business. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#131:2>
Ask: How will the business be a year from now?

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#132:2>
The targets should be specific, measurable, attainable.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#133:2>
For example, you may want your risk analysis consultancy to make
&peso;70,000 a month.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#134:2>
Or you want your Thai cuisine catering service to open a small
restaurant.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#135:2>
Or you want to increase the income from your cell phone repair
service by 25 percent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#136:2>
Ask: What changes do you see in your industry, and how should
you prepare for them? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#137:2>
People may be getting more health-conscious and wary of
cholesterol.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#138:2>
Filipinos ' command of English may be slipping.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#139:2>
Experts see much growth in telecommunications.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#140:2>
While forecasts may not be always accurate, they may help you design
a tentative response plan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#141:2>
Ask: What means are needed to attain my goals? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#142:2>
You must draw up a marketing plan, among others.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#143:2>
Will you rely more on advertising or direct marketing?

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#144:2>
How deeply can you discount for bulk purchases?

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#145:2>
Assuming an increase in sales, can you afford a corresponding
increase in production? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#146:2>
Ask: What is my timetable?

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#147:2>
Projects with no deadlines have no teeth.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#148:2>
A schedule is needed to put order into the entire scheme.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#149:2>
For example, in two weeks the research should be finished.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#150:2>
On week three, the draft report should be ready.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#151:2>
On week four, the legal papers should be finished.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#152:2>
<foreign> Etcetera </foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#153:2>
Getting all the necessary information is crucial for business
success.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#154:2>
As the carpentry adage goes, measure twice, cut once. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Orchid-for-rent is a blooming business </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#156:3>
<bold> Marietta Velasco Giron </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#157:3>
<bold> ORCHID </bold> hobbyist Kelvin Neil Manubay discovered
that winning trophies and ribbons for his beautiful plants is only half the
fun.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#158:3>
The other half is earning money from the hobby. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#159:3>
When you see driftwoods of blooming orchids in church weddings
and big receptions, these are likely from Kelvin 's rent-an-orchid business.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#160:3>
He also rents out pots of blooming cattleyas and <foreign>
dendrobium </foreign> , as well as sell fresh flowers to artists. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#161:3>
<quote> &ldquo; It 's only a small backyard business, something
that grew out of my hobby over the years, &rdquo; </quote> Kelvin says. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#162:3>
He has about 100 pots of cattleyas, 12 driftwoods of <foreign>
vanda teretes </foreign> , and an odd assortment of potted <foreign>
dendrobiums </foreign> and <foreign> phalaenopsis </foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#163:3>
Each driftwood has about 10 <foreign> vandas </foreign> , all
prolific bloomers that produce about 400 flowers a month.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#164:3>
Half of the flowers are sold at &peso;5-&peso;10 each.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#165:3>
The rest are left on the plants for the rent-a-driftwood customers.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#166:3>
<quote> &ldquo; Cattleyas are not as prolific bloomers as the
<foreign> vanda teretes </foreign> , and they bloom sparingly at different
times of the year.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#167:3>
But their flowers are very saleable, and they fetch higher price,
&rdquo; </quote> Kelvin explains. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#168:3>
His cattleyas produce about 25 flowers a month.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#169:3>
At &peso;100-&peso;150 a flower, depending on the size, the
cattleyas bring in, at least, &peso;2,500 a month. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#170:3>
<quote> &ldquo; <foreign> Dendrobium </foreign> and <foreign>
phalaenopsis </foreign> flowers are also saleable.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#171:3>
<foreign> Dendrobium </foreign> flowers sell at &peso;70-&peso;160
per dozen spikes, while <foreign> phalaenopsis </foreign> blooms fetch about
&peso;100 per stalk. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#172:3>
He gripes that he cannot grow enough of both orchids due to limited
space in his garden. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#173:3>
Kelvin, who helps manage the family business <mention> Aksem
Reflexology </mention> , assures other orchid hobbyists that marketing orchid
flowers is easy.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#174:3>
His advice: Just leave your name and telephone number in as many
flower shops as you can find in the telephone directory. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#175:3>
<quote> &ldquo; Once you 've given out your contact number, you
can expect a lot of orders to pour in. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#176:3>
Kelvin adds that you won't even have to deliver the flowers to the
florists.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#177:3>
They are used to picking up freshly cut orchids from growers,
particularly for small orders. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#178:3>
Renting out driftwoods and pots of blooming orchids is a fairly
new business in the country.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#179:3>
Kelvin first tried it out among friends.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-015#180:3>
