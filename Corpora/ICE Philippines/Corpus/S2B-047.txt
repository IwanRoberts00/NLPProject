<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#1:1:A>
Good morning <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#2:1:A>
Uh we would like to thank the organizers for inviting us Professor Karaan and myself uh to present a paper at this Conference
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#3:1:A>
Uh we were a bit hesitant about accepting the invitation since we really had not done any in-depth study of Philippine English in the classroom in the manner of the Gonzalez Alberca and Llamzon studies
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#4:1:A>
But since the paper expected of us was supposed to be on how the policy on the use of English in education is actually being applied in our schools at the present time uh we felt that we could very well talk on that 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#5:1:A>
So at the outset we would like to let you know that our paper <,> is not a definitive <.> cat </.> categorical presentation of Philippine English in the classroom and in the playground
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#6:1:A>
Rather it is more of a <.> mos </.> a collage of concerns of English teachers <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#7:1:A>
After six years of elementary schooling the Filipino student would have had approximately three thousand two hundred forty hours of instruction in English
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#8:1:A>
That is about one thousand eighty hours learning English as a second language and two thousand one hundred sixty hours learning Science and Mathematics with uh English used as medium of instruction
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#9:1:A>
He would have had about five hundred four hours of English as a second language and one thousand eight hours of Science and Mathematics in English in the secondary level or a total of one thousand five hundred twelve hours
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#10:1:A>
Uh four thousand seven hundred fifty-two hours of English in ten years time
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#11:1:A>
That is if neither the student nor the teacher gets absent and if neither code-mixes or if there are no suspension of classes due to typhoons fiestas floods or sports activities
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#12:1:A>
Considering that English is learned as a second language almost exclusively in school with only the teacher as the provider of both oral and uh written input sometimes incomprehensible and the textbooks the only print material readily available it should be of no wonder that most Filipino users of English are proficient in the formal style or what can be called <mention> textbook English </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#13:1:A>
Gonzalez and Alberca in their book Studies on Philippine English nineteen seventy-eight observed that Philippine English of the mass media at least for casual and formal styles seems to be by-and-large textbookish
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#14:1:A>
Written Philippine English follows a classroom uh register classrooms a composition style prevalent in Philippine classrooms 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#15:1:A>
Spoken English is close to textbook English
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#16:1:A>
The prevalence of spelling pronunciation is very evident
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#17:1:A>
Likewise Philippine literature in English reflects a classroom register
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#18:1:A>
A factor which may have contributed to this classroom English phenomenon is the curriculum development process in the Philippine educational system at least in the lower levels of schooling
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#19:1:A>
Curriculum development for the elementary and secondary levels is centralized in specific offices in the Bureau of Elementary Education and in the Bureau of Secondary Education of the Department of Education Culture and Sports
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#20:1:A>
There was a time when institutions of higher learning were designated uhm <,> curriculum development centers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#21:1:A>
The Philippine Normal University was designated Curriculum Development Center for English and Filipino
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#22:1:A>
One of its tasks was to develop the elementary and secondary level textbooks and <w> teachers' </w> manuals in English and Filipino
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#23:1:A>
These materials were to be used in all schools nationwide
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#24:1:A>
In nineteen eighty-three the B E E or Bureau of Elementary Education implemented the New Elementary School Curriculum or N E S C
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#25:1:A>
Minimum learning competencies for English and for all other subjects in each grade level were identified
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#26:1:A>
A document titled Minimum Learning Competencies was printed and issued to all elementary school teachers in the country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#27:1:A>
The M L C was used as the basis for classroom instruction achievement assessment and textbook development
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#28:1:A>
In nineteen eighty-nine the New Elementary School Curriculum was implemented in the secondary schools
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#29:1:A>
This time desired learning competencies for English and for all the other subjects were identified
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#30:1:A>
A document titled Desired Learning Competencies was printed and copies issued to all secondary teachers nationwide and used for the same purposes as the M L C
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#31:1:A>
Today those who go to the public schools from Batanes to Tawi-tawi use the same textbooks the PRODED or Program for Decentralized Educational Development textbook uh Development uh the PRODED textbooks for the elementary level and the S E D P <,> uh textbooks for the secondary level
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#32:1:A>
S E D P stands for Secondary Education Development Program
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#33:1:A>
The earlier generation of Filipinos <,> used Correct English uh grades one to six for language and spelling Philippine Readers for reading during the postwar years Philippine Language Series in the nineteen fifties the <.> bo </.> the books developed by the <.> Phi </.> Philippine Center for Language Study or the P C L S books during the audio-lingual era in the Philippines and the EDPITAF books in the late nineteen seventies
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#34:1:A>
While privately-owned publishing houses produce textbooks for use by private schools these books are nonetheless M L C based or D L C based with additional concepts and tasks which supposedly make the books more difficult than the PRODED or S E D P books
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#35:1:A>
This is based on the perception that private school pupils are intellectually able and can therefore cope with more difficult material
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#36:1:A>
The avowed goal of English language instruction in Philippine schools is the development of communicative competence
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#37:1:A>
The term has become a catch word especially among textbook writers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#38:1:A>
Majority claim that their books develop communicative competence but fail to adequately explain or operationalize the construct
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#39:1:A>
For purposes of this Conference and this paper we look at English in the Philippine classroom as <,> uh a basilect basilect uh mesolect <.> ac </.> acrolect continuum
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#40:1:A>
We go by the definitions suggested by the Conference organizers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#41:1:A>
Basilect or basilect is the low form of the language usually existing only in the spoken form and clearly not regarded as proper English
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#42:1:A>
Acrolect is the high form the prestigious form of English spoken or written which is thought of as appropriate for formal contexts
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#43:1:A>
Mesolect is the intervening form
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#44:1:A>
The basilect to acrolect continuum has been regarded by many second language acquisition researchers as corresponding in many respects to the route followed by second language learners
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#45:1:A>
They have hypothesized that L two learners progress along an interlanguage curriculum uh continuum that series of interlocking systems which Corder nineteen sixty-seven called the learner 's built-in syllabus
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#46:1:A>
Interlanguage also refers to the structured system which the learner constructs at any given stage
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#47:1:A>
Selinker nineteen seventy-two noted that many L two learners perhaps as many as ninety-five percent do not acquire competence in the target language
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#48:1:A>
They do not reach the end of the interlanguage <.> curri </.> uh continuum
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#49:1:A>
He <.> refe </.> uh they stop learning when their interlanguage contains at least some rules different from those of the target language system
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#50:1:A>
He referred to this as <mention> fossilization </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#51:1:A>
Fossilization occurs in most language learners and cannot be remedied by further instruction
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#52:1:A>
You may recall that Braj Kachru uh considers interlanguage a myth <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#53:1:A>
Offhand we can say that uh basilect mesolect and acrolect or the low and high varieties are found in Philippine classrooms in the speech and writing of students teachers supervisors and administrators at the elementary secondary and tertiary levels
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#54:1:A>
In other words many school people like students may be construed as still progressing along the interlanguage continuum their speech and writing probably basilectal
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#55:1:A>
Many others like teachers and supervisors and administrators may have already reached a post-basilectal or near-acrolectal or acrolectal stage
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#56:1:A>
That is they have reached points somewhere near the end of the interlanguage <.> cur </.> continuum
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#57:1:A>
Other may others may have reached a point where both uh right and wrong forms have already fossilized
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#58:1:A>
In this presentation we have restricted ourselves to acrolectal Philippine English as suggested by the Conference organizers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#59:1:A>
We have further restricted ourselves to written English
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#60:1:A>
We have hypothesized that besides professional books and magazines what may also be considered acrolectal written Philippine English in the classroom is the <w> teachers' </w> manuals
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#61:1:A>
The writers and editors of these publications are assumed to have acquired a high level of proficiency in English and are specialists in language education
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#62:1:A>
Therefore they could be expected to be models and provide models of what is acceptable and prestigious English in the classroom
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#63:1:A>
In order to test our hypothesis we decided to do a limited content analysis of a number of <w> teachers' </w> manuals
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#64:1:A>
We did not discount the possibility that unusual lexical and syntactic usage referred to as distinctive features of Philippine English by Gonzalez and Alberca may surface in the instructional materials to be examined
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#65:1:A>
If they do their presence may be explained in several ways
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#66:1:A>
One that the forms are acceptable and have become part of acrolectal Philippine English
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#67:1:A>
Two that the writers and or editors committed performance errors 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#> Or three that the writers and or editors committed competence errors
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#68:1:A>
We decided to focus our analysis on written English in the classroom simply because it is rather difficult to identify the models of spoken classroom acrolect
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#69:1:A>
Unlike Gonzalez and Alberca we hesitate to consider the influential and the elite in the higher echelons of Philippine of the Philippine educational system as the models for either careful or casual spoken English
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#70:1:A>
Having achieved something in the profession is not always a qualification for being a model of spoken classroom acrolect
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#71:1:A>
A set of criteria other than that used by Gonzalez and Alberca in their analysis of spoken English of the mass media may have to be developed <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#72:1:A>
Besides the analysis of <w> teachers' </w> manuals that we did we 'll also present to you uh our textbook analysis done by some graduate students and uh some uh summaries of studies done by uhm some <.> wri </.> also by some uh uh <.> grad </.> teachers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#73:1:A>
May we now present the <.> re </.> the results of our analysis of <w> teachers' </w> manuals
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#74:1:A>
We analyzed eight <w> teachers' </w> manuals written by thirteen textbook writers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#75:1:A>
The main purpose of a <w> teachers' </w> manual is to guide the teacher use the <w> pupils' </w> textbook
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#76:1:A>
Hence there is an extensive use of imperatives
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#77:1:A>
That is why some editors have commented that <w> teachers' </w> manuals are too preachy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#78:1:A>
Interrogatives come in the form of exact questions to be asked of the students but embedded in the imperative sentences
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#79:1:A>
The explanatory notes or background information for teachers very often are couched in the declarative sentences
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#80:1:A>
Our analysis of the <w> teachers' </w> manuals revealed that majority of the distinctive features of written English as identified by Gonzalez and Alberca <,> uh were also present in written classroom English
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#81:1:A>
Here are some examples <,> <&> numerous examples given; they have been omitted from this text </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#> These data can be quite disconcerning disconcerting to many E S L E F L teachers specialists and also to linguists
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#> Now uhm in some instances they can be magnanimous and consider the constructions to be errors of performance
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#> Nonetheless it cannot be denied that there are there are many which may be considered errors of competence that these are wrong forms or that these uh are wrong forms which have fossilized in the idiolect of the writer or they can say that or have the constructions become acceptable so that the editors pass them off as correct
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#> At this point probably Murcia and Freeman 's comment can be illuminating <X> long quotation </X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#> Rather than pass judgments on these <.> in </.> constructions and wring our hands in dismay and lament over the sorry state of English in Philippine classrooms or accept the forms as they are and wait until they become part of acrolectal Philippine English implications for textbook development grammar instruction and lexicography can be drawn and probably also on the editorial standards of our local publishing houses
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#> Now uh what how about our high school students what are they capable of doing in the language 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#> Pe&ntilde;aranda conducted a study to determine the syntactic complexity of the editorials feature stories and essays written by staff members of the school papers of several secondary schools in the City of Manila
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#> For this purpose she used minimal terminable units or T units but limited herself to structures which resulted from sentence-embedding <.> transform </.> transformations
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#> She fond found out that as the students advanced in years the staff members used uh they also used more sentence-embedded structures and more adjectival than nominal and adverbial sentence-embedded structures
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#> She also found out that length and number of T units advanced correspondingly with advance in year level
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#> She surmised that on the basis of the <.> stati </.> statistical predominance of sentence-embedded adjectivals the students had already mastered the use of simple adjective modifiers and that they could handle restrictive clauses <mention> of </mention> -phrases and some prepositional phrase post-modifiers relatively relatively well
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#> It should be noted however that the compositions examined were written by a select group
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#> A similar study was conducted earlier by Mendiola in fact she 's uh here right now
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#> She analyzed the constituents of noun phrase and verb phrase constructions the kinds of sentence patterns the kinds of sentences according to clause structures and the kinds of subordinate clauses used by one hundred fifty grade four five and six pupils
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#> She also used T units as a measure of syntactic complexity
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#> Mendiola found out that the length of T units increased significantly with advance in grade level 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#> The grade five and six pupils produced more <.> structu </.> structurally complex structures than grade four pupils and the pupils used adverbial clauses more frequently followed by nominal and adjectival clauses
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#> The foregoing findings bode well for our young learners
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-047#> We take it as a signal that they are capable of acquiring a high level of proficiency of in English of course under appropriate circumstances
