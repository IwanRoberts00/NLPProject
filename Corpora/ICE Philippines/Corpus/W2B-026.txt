<h> <bold> What you should know about dengue fever </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#2:1>
<h> <bold> Government must realize the outbreak is serious, that
insecticides, fogging and antibiotics won't help </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#3:1>
<bold> Dean Jorge Bocobo </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#4:1>
EPIDEMIC or not, it is time for the authorities and the public to
take the current outbreak of dengue fever seriously and to take appropriate
action. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#5:1>
There are actually two types of dengue fever.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#6:1>
The first, which we may call <mention> &ldquo; classical dengue fever
&rdquo; </mention> has been known for over 200 years, with the first reported
cases arising in 1779 and 1780 from a simultaneous outbreak in Cairo, Egypt,
Jakarta, Indonesia and Philadelphia, USA. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#7:1>
Since then, classical dengue has been reported in Asia, Africa and
the Americas with epidemics every 30 or 40 years.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#8:1>
Despite severe symptoms of pain and fever, classical dengue was seldom
fatal. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#9:1>
But in 1953-54, an epidemic broke out in the Philippines in which
a much more severe and potentially fatal form, <mention> &ldquo; dengue
hemorrhagic fever &rdquo; </mention> was observed by E. N. Quintos and other
health researchers here who reported their historic findings in the
Philippine Journal of Pediatrics ( Volume 3).

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#10:1>
During that epidemic, they observed a frightening and often fatal
form of dengue fever in which many victims died from the shock that
accompanied internal bleeding.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#11:1>
This form of dengue is accompanied by acute bleeding through the nose
and in the gastrointestinal tract which can lead to dengue shock syndrome, a
life-threatening condition requiring immediate hospitalization and medical
care.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#12:1>
The effects and symptoms have been likened to that of <foreign> ebola
</foreign> in Africa. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#13:1>
Recent news reports contain anecdotal evidence that the current
outbreak of dengue in the Philippines has significant component of this more
virulent strain of the disease.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#14:1>
The US Center for Disease Control reports that there are up to 100
million cases of dengue fever worldwide, mainly in the tropics, and several
hundred thousand cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#15:1>
Dengue is actually caused by four distinct strains of a virus, so
that persons living in epidemic areas can potentially come down with dengue
four times before acquiring immunity.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#16:1>
The virus is carried and transmitted by the <foreign> <it> Aedes
Aegyptii </it> </foreign> mosquito ( see accompanying illustration), which is
known to be a daytime feeder that prefers human blood.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#17:1>
Only the pregnant females bite, delivering a virus load present in
their salivary glands.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#18:1>
The viruses themselves are exceedingly small ( much smaller than a
millionth of a meter) and can hijack the body 's cell machinery to breed and
reproduce. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#19:1>
There is no vaccine or direct antiviral drug proven to be
effective against classical or hemorrhagic dengue fever.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#20:1>
For the milder strain, supportive care such as bed rest and antifever
medications are normally enough.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#21:1>
However, blood transfusions, supplemental oxygen and shock therapy
are required for the more virulent strain. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#22:1>
Past experience has shown that in countries such as the
Philippines, the peak of an epidemic has been reached or surpassed long
before the authorities can declare its existence because there is no truly
effective monitoring or reporting system.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#23:1>
Therefore, the present situation may already be more serious than the
government claims it to be. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#24:1>
Moreover, the standard approach of spraying or fogging with
insecticides may not be effective for several reasons.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#25:1>
First, these are usually capable of killing off only the adult
mosquito carriers, not their dormant eggs.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#26:1>
With the rains increasing, even the most persistent insecticide
programs may be insufficient to control the carriers which inherit the virus
from their mothers through viral infection of their eggs.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#27:1>
The insects themselves are not affected by the viruses. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#28:1>
Second, insecticide control is progressively ineffective; just as
in antibiotic overuse, insecticide programs only kill off the susceptible
mosquitoes, leaving resistant varieties to dominate the overall population.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#29:1>
Therefore, prevention and sanitation are essential to successful
control of the mosquito carriers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#30:1>
Since the females lay their eggs in water, the public should
eliminate all possible nesting sites, such as rubber tires and other
containers of stagnant water in their neighborhoods and immediate
surroundings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#31:1>
Children are most at risk so parents should take any flulike
symptoms seriously, especially those accompanied by high fever, and seek
immediate medical attention in such cases. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#32:1>
Because the principal carrier is a daytime feeder, schools must
take especial care to eliminate mosquito infestation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#33:1>
The same applies to factories, churches and offices since adults can
be just as susceptible to the disease, depending on overall immune condition
and genetic disposition. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#34:1>
Government inaction is most deplorable.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#35:1>
However, the public should not wait for its uncertain and
undependable reaction to the warning signs.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#36:1>
The virus and its carrier may be exceedingly small creatures but the
damage of which they are capable certainly is not. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Alternative sources of calcium for the lactose-intolerant
</bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#38:2>
<bold> Rowena C. Burgos </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#39:2>
MOST Filipinos consume very little milk ( traditionally a good
source of calcium), that is, one-fourth cup a day.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#40:2>
This is equivalent to only 340 milligrams of daily calcium intake,
just 67 percent of the recommended dietary allowance ( RDA) of 600 mg, says a
National Nutrition Survey done a few years ago. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#41:2>
Despite the emergence of many nutraceutical additives like
<foreign> ginseng </foreign> and bee pollen, calcium has remained one of the
best around. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#42:2>
In the human body, which consists of about two percent calcium by
weight, about 99 percent of this calcium occurs in the bones and teeth and
the remainder in body cells and fluids.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#43:2>
This remainder is essential to muscle contraction and hence to
cardiac function, transmission of nerve impulses and in blood coagulation.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#44:2>
Parathyroid and thyroid hormones help maintain proper calcium
balance in the tissues.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#45:2>
Without enough calcium, the body searches for another source of
calcium - - the bones in a process called calcium cannibalism.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#46:2>
It can impair growth and lead to such conditions as rickets, tetany
and osteoporosis. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#47:2>
Low-fat milk and dairy products, water, <foreign> tofu </foreign>
, leafy green vegetables and fermented fish are sources of dietary calcium.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#48:2>
But for some adults and even infants, milk and other dairy products
cause a discomfort known as lactose intolerance.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#49:2>
Others worry about the high-calorie content of such products.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#50:2>
Still others are simply allergic to these food supplements. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#51:2>
But we may soon be able to enjoy calcium-fortified ice cream,
cookies, pies, juices and even coffee through a new calcium treatment process
unveiled recently in the United States. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#52:2>
This new treatment process enables calcium to be soluble in low
viscosity liquids and stabilized in high-acid products.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#53:2>
This could lead to food processors being able to add nutritionally
significant levels of calcium to ice cream, cookies, pie fillings, powdered
cheese mixes, coffee creamers and liquid nutrition products. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#54:2>
The new method combines calcium salts with milk or soy proteins
and then spray dried.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#55:2>
The outcome is a combination of high-calcium proteins, which when put
back into water, results in calcium being suspended.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#56:2>
The process uses calcium carbonate which makes it inexpensive and
practical to add enough of the said mineral in a wide array of food. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#57:2>
One of the biggest potential applications for the new method is
liquid nutrition supplements.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#58:2>
Nutritionists are looking at giving consumers more calcium-fortified
liquid products such as juices to provide an alternative to traditionally
calcium-enriched milk products. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#59:2>
One of them is the Philippine Health Food Center, Inc. (
PhilHealth) which recently introduced Calciumade, the first high-calcium
drink in the country which comes in a refreshing natural orange flavor. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#60:2>
Available in powder form, a glass of Calciumade is equivalent to
300 mg of calcium, the same amount supplied by a glass of milk.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#61:2>
Two glasses of Calciumade provides the Philippine RDA for calcium.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#62:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Milk is still the best source of calcium but
since there are people who cannot tolerate it, Calciumade, a little on the
acid side, would be a good alternative.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#63:2>
Seven to nine servings of broccoli a day which is equivalent to three
to four glasses of milk is also a very good source of calcium but broccoli is
too expensive," </quote> said Dr. Imelda Ayaso-Sapalo, director of the
medical affairs division of United Laboratories, Inc. during the product
launch of Calciumade. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#64:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Calcium tablets can also be taken but they have a
bitter after-taste.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#65:2>
Unlike Calciumade which is delicious, easy on the stomach, light and
lactose-free, it also contains Vitamins A, B, C and E, Niacin, Pantholenic
Acid, Phosphorus and Magnesium, &rdquo; </quote> added Stephanie Co, product
manager of PhilHealth. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#66:2>
Calcium is the essential mineral that builds bones and keeps them
healthy and strong.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#67:2>
Bones constantly undergo remodeling, says Dr. Sapalo, at a rate of 50
percent a year in young children and five percent a year in adults. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#68:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Bone takes a lot of stress so it has to be
remodeled.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#69:2>
Bone resorption is followed by bone formation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#70:2>
For this to take place, calcium intake is very important.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#71:2>
The phase in remodeling becomes abnormal once it results in bone
fracture," </quote> explained Dr. Sapalo. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#72:2>
Research reveals that in aging men and women, especially
post-menopausal females, calcium absorption and bone formation is reduced and
rapid bone loss of 15 percent in five years occurs.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#73:2>
Osteoporosis, the thinning and weakening of bones, results from lack
of calcium.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#74:2>
Its prevalence rate is 21 percent among Asians and Caucasians; 16% in
Hispanics; and 10% in African-Americans who have higher bone mass than Asians
and Caucasians. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#75:2>
Women are more likely to develop this bone disorder because they
have less bone tissue and lose bone more rapidly than men due to the changes
involved in menopause. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#76:2>
Aside from not enough calcium intake, aging, female menopause,
white/Asian ancestry, small-boned or petite form, the other risk factors for
osteoporosis are family history of osteoporosis, certain diseases and
medications like anticonvulsants and thyroid medication, caffeine, smoking, a
diet heavy in salt, animal protein or fiber, alcohol, carbonated beverages,
inadequate or excessive exercise resulting in cessation of menstruation and
emotional stress. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Artificial coral reef - a new home for marine life </bold>
</h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#78:3>
<bold> Ronald M. Henson </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#79:3>
IF THE natural runs out, try artificial means! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#80:3>
This is the moral of the story behind Project SOMAL ( Save Our
Marine Life) located in Aplaya, Digos, Davao del Sur where young
student-environmentalists rehabilitated the damaged sea corals using the
twig-like spadices from the coconut that serve as the new sanctuary for the
marine life. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#81:3>
The major problem of coral reefs in this country is caused by the
pressure of human population.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#82:3>
There are just too many fishermen who overfish the seas, and stress
the coral reef ecosystem.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#83:3>
Even during low tide, the gleaners composed of men, women and
children comb the area for edible and marketable marine products.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#84:3>
As a result, the reef flats rapidly become less diverse, less
productive and plundered. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#85:3>
In view of these, what management measures can be recommended to
restore our corals?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#86:3>
One way to save our reefs is to limit access to them.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#87:3>
But this will be one mean task.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#88:3>
Another move is to establish marine parks and reserves, however, they
can only serve as limited replenishment areas for marine organisms. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#89:3>
Cognizant of this situation, the first year students of Davao del
Sur National High School ( DDSNHS) have come to the rescue.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#90:3>
They bundled the coconut spadices which are the fleshy spikes in a
leaflike structure of the coconut tree that are brownish in color, tied them
to stones as sinkers and dropped in the sea to serve as substitute for coral
reefs.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#91:3>
The first dropping was done in September 1994, some 500 meters away
from the shoreline, at 12 feet deep during low tide.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#92:3>
With continuous droppings of bundles of spadices, fishers found a new
<quote> &ldquo; home where they can lay eggs, hatch and shelter the young, or
even collect their food from the artificial reef. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#93:3>
For the success of Project SOMAL which is benefitting the people
of the entire province of Davao del Sur, President Fidel V. Ramos awarded the
students and advisers of DDSNHS the Grand Prize for the 2nd 1995 <indig>
Gawad </indig> AGKATEK, a yearly search-competition sponsored by the Science
Education Institute ( SEI) of the Department of Science and Technology (
DOST). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#94:3>
The DDSNHS Science Club sought the assistance of the officials of
<indig> Nagkahiusang Mangingisda sa Katawhan </indig> ( NAMANGKA), and the
personnel of the Aquatic Services Development Economic Council ( ASDEC) in
putting up the project.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#95:3>
But at first, NAMANGKA and ASDEC were hesitant to do the project
based on the past experience of using spare tires for artificial reefs which
never worked at all. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#96:3>
With persistence and zeal, the young students who showed concern
over the endangered marine ecosystem finally convinced the government and the
non-government agency to launch Project SOMAL.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#97:3>
On July 30, 1994, a one-day seminar was held by the ASDEC staff for
the students ' awareness of the protection and preservation of the marine
life. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#98:3>
Thus, Project SOMAL came into existence with the following
objectives: 1) to restore the habitat of the marine fishes using the coconut
spadices as artificial coral reef, 2) to help small fishermen increase their
income when more fishes abound along the coastal communities of Digos, Davao
del Sur, and 3) to promote awareness of marine protection and conservation
among the youth. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#99:3>
The making of an artificial &ldquo; home &rdquo; for the fishes
is in low cost.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#100:3>
The spadices are collected free, then bundled using a nylon and tied
to stones serving as sinkers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#101:3>
A truck is needed to haul the spadices and stones.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#102:3>
The fishermen of NAMANGKA helped a great deal in dropping the
spadice-bundles into the sea, and in keeping a vigilant watch of the
operation of the project. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#103:3>
The procedures from collection of spadices to dropping of the
bundles are simple.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#104:3>
Here 's how a community can go into artificial coral reefing:

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#105:3>
1. Collect the spadices, assign a quota to a community in order to
maximize collection of spadices.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#106:3>
2. Gather the stones of 2-3 kgs. each.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#107:3>
3. Make the bundles, about 3-4 are tied tightly together by a nylon
to make a bundle.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#108:3>
4. Make the sinkers by placing the stones in the nylon baskets and
tying at the bottom of the bundles.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#109:3>
5. Drop the bundles of spadices 500 meters away from the shoreline,
at 12 feet deep, the bundles must be five meters far apart from each other.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#110:3>
6. Keep watch and safeguard the artificial reef.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#111:3>
7. Add bundles of spadices at least yearly to have a continuous
stock of artificial coral reef for the marine life. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#112:3>
After 11 months, some favorable results were observed by the
Davao fishermen and divers--more fish supply, more fish eggs have been laid
for the future, and a safer nursery and habitat for fishes and other marine
organisms. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#113:3>
The environment-consciousness efforts extended by the NAMANGKA,
ASDEC, BFAR, <indig> barangay </indig> and school officials are indeed
commendable.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#114:3>
And the young science clubbers ' efforts at the restoration of this
sea habitat which had been damaged by man 's reckless disregard of nature is
a badge of courage. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-026#115:3>
Now, if you go to the project site, you can see thousands and
thousands of fingerlings inhabiting the SOMAL artificial coral reef, an
indication that the fishes happily thrive in a newly-found home. </p> </I>
