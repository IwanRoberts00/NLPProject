<h> SOCIOLOGY and the Red Violin </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#3:2>
First of all, what is the red violin?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#4:2>
The violin was born in France, lived through its youth in a monastery,
taken by a young musical miracle from thence to fair Verona, crossed
thousands of miles, climbed high mountains, and sailed through vast seas and
oceans to reach Asia and the New World.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#5:2>
Now, this infamous blood-coated violin is in the hands of an
African-American living in New York.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#6:2>
What great importance does this musical artifact bare that it was
treasured by all its masters and kept in care with costs insignificant?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#7:2>
How is it that many of the great men have tempted their fates by
challenging culture, attempting to transcend massive cultural boundaries and
found scampering back, while this artifact had traveled to most of the world
with wounds that have proved not to be irreparable?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#8:2>
How can it be that the violin had, instead of being affected by the
effects of culture, reversed the natural way and turned the tables in
inflicting to that culture the effects of the Red Violin? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#9:2>
The violin was originally a European musical instrument.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#10:2>
It then, like many other European cultural influences, diffused to
even some of the remotest parts of the third world.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#11:2>
The violin is a material component of Europe 's culture.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#12:2>
It is the embodiment of music, the universal nonmaterial aspect, of
Europe.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#13:2>
Violins in general are handcrafted.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#14:2>
This one in particular was especially made.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#15:2>
It was a masterpiece.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#16:2>
Judging by that fact, violins are part of high culture mainly due to
their unavailability to the masses because of price.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#17:2>
Therefore, in continuity, the violin is a material component of the
high European culture. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#18:2>
Referring to a single situation in the movie instead of
explaining the movie in whole in order to concentrate our efforts within a
limited perimeter, we shall take the part of the movie wherein the Red Violin
had arrived at Mainland China.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#19:2>
It is evident here that the Chinese are highly unreceptive to foreign
influences that they actually reached the point that they burned these
foreign ( to be more specific European) artifacts just to openly show their
disgust.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#20:2>
As the Chinese woman high official had said, <quote> &ldquo; Foreign
things are worthless and useless; they are nothing in comparison to what our
culture has to offer. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#21:2>
Ethnocentrism is very evident here.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#22:2>
There is even no need to expound more on it being that it is already
very obvious.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#23:2>
This ethnocentrism is even taken to the next level when the head
military woman looked very ready to condemn and even outcast ( and who knows
what more) the man who was found to be in possession of a violin.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#24:2>
It is also equally evident as the value of Love is shown to have less
bearing in comparison to their ethnocentricity driven nationality when the
husband of the woman in possession of the Red Violin reported his own wife to
the authorities knowing what the effects of these allegations are.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#25:2>
His wife could have been removed from her high position in the
military and maybe even worse punishments could have been given to her not
only for her possession of these artifacts but also for her deceit in trying
to hide them being a military woman of her stature.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#26:2>
This just serves as a great portrayal of either their great hatred
for the Europeans/foreign culture, jealousy for the high advancement of these
other countries, or just simply their love for their own nation and culture.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#27:2>
Enough of the one sided conversation, we shall now take it in the
perspective of the other side.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#28:2>
Naturally if there is a pro side there will always be a con side.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#29:2>
In this case, these characters were played by the woman with the Red
Violin and the man whose violin was burned.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#30:2>
They symbolize the cultural minority and also they embody not only
their state of minority but also their reversal of perspective.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#31:2>
They are not only culturally relative regarding the European culture,
the violin in particular, but as shown, they possess a passion and love of
it.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#32:2>
In a way, a xenocentrism is evident within them.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#33:2>
The only deviation is the fact that the Chinese were never really
colonized as a whole at the same point in time, but some of their regions
have been colonized; therefore, the term xenocentrism may and may not
completely suit them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#34:2>
The culture of a society defines the who, what, where, when, and
more importantly the how of the people within that cultural boundary.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#35:2>
It identifies exactly their society as a whole.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#36:2>
The receptivity in this case varies depending on the people in
question.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#37:2>
The Chinese are highly unreceptive, so are the Japanese.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#38:2>
We Filipinos are the contrast of these countries.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#39:2>
We are highly xenocentric.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#40:2>
Some would even say that we are the epitome of xenocentricity.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#41:2>
We are said to be the full embodiment of the colonial mentality.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#42:2>
The United States of America, being a multicultural society, is
receptive to the influence of various cultures.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#43:2>
The French are highly anti-African.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#44:2>
Most Africans in turn are highly Afrocentric, and the Europeans is
general are Eurocentric.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#45:2>
This perspective varies, and it may be included as part of the
society 's culture.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#46:2>
This phenomenon was, though not fully but significantly, explained by
the Sapir-Whorf theory, a theory that states that a country 's language may
serve as the &ldquo; lenses &rdquo; in which the people of that country see
the world.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#47:2>
This serves as minimal explanation why the Japanese and Chinese (
whose languages are drastically different from those of the rest of the
world, specifically those that are of the west) are highly ethnocentric and
possess strict norms regarding culture preservation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#48:2>
We then begin to wonder where had all these patterns of
sociological thinking begun?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#49:2>
If culture is derived from the societies ' practices and various
beliefs, norms, and values, then what had started the unending train of
belief created after belief, norm derived from another norm, and values
revised to create a new but essentially the same value?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#50:2>
This is related to the question we had posed in the beginning of this
essay.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#51:2>
Why does it seem that the culture had less effect on the Red Violin
as it had traveled through the various continents than the effect the Red
Violin had posed on those cultures?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#52:2>
It is evident that as different things come and go passing through
and out of the cultural boundaries that time had defined so clearly, the
piece of culture that transcends through these boundaries is not as much
affected by being in the current culture than the culture is being changed by
the presence of that object.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#53:2>
Objects have already been created in their permanent form.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#54:2>
The form that they are made into is the same form that they shall
leave existence as.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#55:2>
These creations of culture or embodiments of culture are but
representations of culture itself; therefore, it is unchanging.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#56:2>
Culture, on the other hand, is dynamic.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#57:2>
It is ever changing.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#58:2>
As time passes, culture changes.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#59:2>
This can be clearly seen in the movie, <mention> the Red Violin
</mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#60:2>
When the violin was born, it was an instrument found almost only in
Europe alone, but as time passed, it had been a bit more spread out and in
some regions, like China, it was banned.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#61:2>
Finally, the present showed that the Red Violin became one of the
most coveted artifacts of that time, and ironically, those who had thrown (
Chinese) or given ( the monks) it away were present in the auction lusting
for the Red Violin.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#62:2>
They wanted it back so much that they were willing to buy it back at
auction price ( much more risky and expensive than the retail price).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#63:2>
The violin had changed the culture in which it had traversed.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#64:2>
The monks were forever left with a hope of finding a gifted musician,
their only source of fame or attention from the outside world.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#65:2>
The Chinese were left with the minority group, who would eventually
rebel for the love of music.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#66:2>
The Europeans were given the title of being the greatest musicians
due to the fact that they had created one of the greatest and most famous and
ingenious musical instruments the world had ever seen.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#67:2>
To me all of this is a bit exaggerated, these people seem to take
things pretty quickly to the next level, but that 's how society works.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#68:2>
These are the effects of the great interwinding and interdependency
of the various components of culture to give a result of minor to massive
changes to the said culture. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#69:2>
The Red Violin is here not just an object of musical art where an
aesthetic emotion can be derived but it has now evidently become a tool of
cultural diffusion and cultural change.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#70:2>
It has the power of the greatest war machine because it instills men
and women to be influenced by what is seemingly a harmless object of art but
what can be used to propagate a war, incite a revolt, or for any reason the
creator deems necessary.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#71:2>
The Spanish had used religion, specifically Christianity, to put us
into chains.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#72:2>
The Americans used education to exploit our resources, and who knows,
the Red Violin might have then been used to inspire the musicians to band
together in revolt as the martial artists in China had once formed an
alliance against the government in the Boxer rebellion. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#73:2>
Culture is the embodiment of its many small parts.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#74:2>
One of which is the Red Violin.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#75:2>
Culture shapes our society into what it is, and culture defines us
for who we are and what we stand for.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#76:2>
Culture shapes everything we do.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#77:2>
So, wouldn't it be deducible that the violin in its own little
significant way decides who and what the violinists are?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#78:2>
Notice that the music played by each using the Red Violin is the
same.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#79:2>
Doesn't it signify the similarities the violinists have judging by
the mere fact that they all play the violin and have a special taste for that
specific violin? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#80:2>
Operating in the same line of thought, we can say that if we
replace the violin with some other object of culture, the effects would be
similar?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#81:2>
I 'm now using a computer to type this essay and in the same way,
others are also typing their reports.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#82:2>
This creates an impalpable link between people.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#83:2>
If the Sapir-Whorf theory stated that language serves as the lens
through which people see the world, then we could also say that the artifacts
serve as the link through which we see others without the illusion of the
lens of language for we can relate with another who does not speak our
language, but by the mere fact that you play the same instrument you have an
unbreakable link through which communication is possible.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#84:2>
Music is then one way to see the world through the lens of another.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#85:2>
Isn't it a wonder how the most insignificant of objects may through
the course of its life alter so much?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#86:2>
The Red Violin, at the moment of its death, had lived a greater life
than any hero of any country had.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#87:2>
It had instilled changes that even the great conquerors like Napoleon
Bonaparte, Adolf Hitler, Alexander the Great, or Attila the great king of the
Hans could have ever done.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-007#88:2>
Then it can be said that the individuals who had influenced the world
the most were not the great conquerors or the great heroes of the nation but
the creators whose masterpieces shall live nearly forever and through the
course of its long life, build cities, move capitals, and alter even the most
ethnocentric cultures. </p> </I>
