<h> <bold> ABSTRACT </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#4:1>
Use of botanical biocides is suggested as solution to problems
associated with synthetic pesticides, especially environmental pollution and
toxicity to non-target organisms.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#5:1>
Research initiatives to achieve full acceptance and policy action on
research support, patenting and registration are discussed. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#6:1>
<h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#7:1>
One of the greatest challenges facing the world today is the
production of adequate food for a rapidly rising population.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#8:1>
The Population Reference Bureau ( U.S.A.) projected that the world 's
population could expand from today 's 5.5 to 6 billion by year 2000 and 10 -
14 billion by year 2045.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#9:1>
The pressure to increase food production has been particularly acute
in Africa and in the developing countries of Asia.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#10:1>
The latter 's population is projected to rise to 4.9 billion by year
2025. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#11:1>
During the past 20 years, the Asia-Pacific countries such as
Australia, China, Japan, South Korea, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Bangladesh
and the Philippines, increased rice production by an amount far exceeding the
yield level achieved during the preceding decades.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#12:1>
This was due to the introduction of semi-dwarf, photo-sensitive and
high yielding varieties of rice.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#13:1>
This was followed by the introduction of high-yielding varieties of
other crops. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#14:1>
However, the conditions favoring better crop growth also favor
the proliferation of pests and diseases.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#15:1>
The very technologies that help increase the yield per unit of land,
water, time and energy also often cause low yields due to pests.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#16:1>
On world wide basis, the pre-harvest losses due to weeds, plant
disease and arthropod and vertebrate pests range from 30 to 35% ( Cramer
1967).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#17:1>
Post-harvest losses may amount to an additional 10 to 20%.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#18:1>
The losses due to pests are indeed enormous.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#19:1>
For rice alone, the estimated value of yield loss due to pests in the
Philippines is about &peso;9.2B ( US &dollar; 360M).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#20:1>
In Vietnam losses is about 1.6M tons of harvested rice valued at
US&dollar;350-360M ( Highley 1995). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#21:1>
Agriculture has been revolutionized by the use of material inputs
such as quality seeds, fertilizers, irrigation water and pesticides.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#22:1>
Among these, pesticides and fertilizers account for a big portion of
the farmer 's production expense.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#23:1>
In the Philippines, pesticide input was estimated to be about 20-25%
of the total cost inputs in the production of vegetables, rice and corn in
1982. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#24:1>
The role of the synthetic pesticides in the green revolution in
many countries of the world cannot be underestimated.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#25:1>
However, the indiscriminate use and overuse of these pesticides have
caused detrimental effects on non-target organisms, development of
resistance, pest resurgence and environmental pollution.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#26:1>
These predicaments and the energy crisis in the late ' 70s prompted
researchers especially in South Asia to revive interest towards naturally
occurring pest control compounds from plants. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#27:1>
More than 2,000 plants species reportedly possess pest control
properties ( Grainge and Ahmed 1988).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#28:1>
Plants are doubtless an abundant source of active compounds which can
serve as insecticides, rodenticides, molluscicides, bactericides,
nematicides, weedicides, etc.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#29:1>
These compounds may act as toxicant and/or may influence the growth,
development, behavior, reproduction and fitness of the pests in various ways.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#30:1>
These are categorized as toxicants, growth hormones or regulators,
feeding and egg laying deterrents, sterilants, attractants, repellants,
<foreign> etc. </foreign> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#31:1>
Plants containing active compounds can be utilized directly or as
a basis for synthesizing novel pesticides.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#32:1>
The plants can be used directly in three forms or ways:

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#33:1>
1. As whole plant ( or parts) with simple processing: chopped, ground
or extracted with water or organic solvent ( crude extractives);

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#34:1>
2. as active fraction extractive; and

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#35:1>
3. as formulated crude or active fraction extractive or formulated
isolated active principle. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#36:1>
In this paper, I will use the term plant biocides or botanical
biocides to refer to the plant-derived products for pest control to
differentiate it from the synthetic analogues of the active chemical compound
from plants.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#37:1>
This is to remove the anathema to the word <mention> &ldquo;
pesticide &rdquo; </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#38:1>
For instance, natural pyrethrin will be botanical biocide and
synthetic pyrenthroids as botanical pesticides. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#39:1>
<h> <bold> RESEARCH ACTIONS </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#40:1>
<h> <bold> Technical Needs </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#41:1>
In whatever form the plant biocides are envisioned to be used,
research has to address some technical, ecological, and socioeconomic issues
to facilitate their acceptance in crop protection. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#42:1>
For a plant biocide to be accepted by the regulatory agency,
farmers and the public, data have to be generated about its activity and
efficacy, cost effectiveness, safety to man and non-target organisms and
degradability in the environment. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#43:1>
<h> <bold> Biological Evaluation </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#44:1>
Laboratory and field screening are very important to obtain,
produce and eventually utilize potential biocidal plants.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#45:1>
Fig. 1graphically presents the different biological evaluation
schemes of plant biocides that have been implemented in the laboratory of the
Department of Entomology at U.P. Los Ba&ntilde;os. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#46:1>
Many of the studies on botanicals in the region follow Scheme A.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#47:1>
In this scheme, the potential material can be selected rapidly and
utilized with little processing like the use of <foreign> neem </foreign>
cake ( <it> <foreign> Azadirachta indica </foreign> </it> ) and <foreign>
neem </foreign> oil ( Ketkar and Ketkar 1993) and the use of ground or
powdered <indig> makabuhai </indig> ( <it> <foreign> Tinospora crispa
</foreign> </it> ) for broadcasting in the field ( Morallo-Rejesus and
Garcia, 1988).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#48:1>
But this scheme does not answer questions on safety.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#49:1>
In 1988, we decided to follow Scheme B and recently Scheme C and D.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#50:1>
The very objective of Scheme B is to immediately identify the
safe extractives to man and/or fish ( if used in lowland rice) and the
beneficial insects of the target pests for immediate evaluation in the field.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#51:1>
With the knowledge that <indig> makabuhai </indig> extractive is very
safe, ( oral and dermal LD50 's mg/kg) I was confident in recommending its
use, which in earlier evaluations showed to be very effective against rice
green leafhopper ( GHL), brown planthopper ( BHP) and rice stemborers (
Morallo-Rejesus and Gracia, 1988).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#52:1>
Although, plant extractives can be freely prepared and used by the
farmers without restrictions, surveys showed that most farmers would rather
buy the extractives than plant or procure and process it themselves. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#53:1>
If botanical biocides will be formulated and sold, it will be
subjected to the same government regulations as synthetic chemicals.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#54:1>
At present, the acute mammalian and fish toxicity data derived from
testing extractives are unacceptable to regulatory agencies.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#55:1>
Safety to non-target organisms, stability and standardization are
major questions to be hurdled before a product can be registered and sold to
farmers.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#56:1>
These requirements necessitate the isolation and identification of
the active principle.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#57:1>
In our recent works, active fractions have been isolated and
bioassayed ( Scheme C) and/or purified, identified, formulated and field
evaluated ( Scheme D).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#58:1>
For instance, rotenone was isolated from <it> <foreign> Derris
elliptica </foreign> </it> and was formulated and evaluated in the field.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#59:1>
It was found to be effective against <it> <foreign> Myzus persicae
</foreign> </it> and <it> <foreign> Melanagromyza phaseoli </foreign> </it>
on legume, <it> <foreign> Atherigona oryzae </foreign> </it> on corn and <it>
<foreign> Plutella xylostella </foreign> </it> on crucifers (
Morallo-Rejesus, 1994). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#60:1>
<h> <bold> Bioassay </bold> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#61:1>
In all the schemes, biological assays play a very important role in
ascertaining the toxicity on the target pests ( weeds, pathogens and insects)
and non-target organisms. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#62:1>
There are a number of problems in the bioassay of extracts of
many plant species.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#63:1>
The activity of an extract may depend on the plant part used; the
place, method and time of collection, extraction and solvent used; the test
organism ( age, stage, sex, rearing media); and the method of application.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#64:1>
To be able to accurately ascertain activity and select promising
materials, there must be a proper biological assay.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#65:1>
Updated bioassay procedures are reported by Reichelderfer ( 1992)
Yopp ( 1992) and Redfern ( 1992). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#66:1>
Many papers on botanical biocides particularly on insects in the
Philippines and other Asian countries reveal the usage of high dosages,
insect mixed sexes, and not so sensitive methods; the studies measure
toxicity effect only in their bioassays.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#67:1>
The bioassay for insecticidal action, for instance, should include
toxicity ( contact, stomach, ovicidal and systemic), deterrent to feeding (
antifeedant) and egg laying ( anti-ovipositant), attractancy/repellancy,
insect growth inhibitory effect ( juvenile and moulting hormone mimics),
sterilant effect, <foreign> etc. </foreign> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#68:1>
A material exhibiting behavioral and growth inhibitory ( IGR)
effects may tend to be selective and exclude man and other non-target
organisms, hence, it will probably be more acceptable to the regulatory
agency and the public, especially if utilized in the context of IPM.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#69:1>
Further, the additive effects can make the material more effective on
variety of insects and may have multifarious uses.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#70:1>
Several plants such as <foreign> neem </foreign> , <it> <foreign>
Melia </foreign> </it> spp., <it> <foreign> Anoma </it> sp. </foreign> , <it>
<foreign> Ayuga </it> sp. </foreign> , <it> <foreign> Vitex </it> spp.
</foreign> , etc. have been bioassayed for different activities.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#71:1>
The divergent effects of various preparations of <foreign> neem
</foreign> on different stages of the insect is shown in Table 1 (
Schmutterer 1992) and of 14 plants from the Philippines in Table 2 (
Morallo-Rejesus <foreign> et al. </foreign> , 1993). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#72:1>
Further the plant biocides should be evaluated against different
pest organisms to maximize its use.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#73:1>
For example, <foreign> neem </foreign> was found to be active on 250
insects but biocidal on certain viruses, fungi, bacteria, nematodes and
snails ( Ketkar and Ketkar 1993; Maini and Morallo-Rejesus 1993; Saxena 1993;
Singh 1993, Warthen 1989).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#74:1>
Among the many plants evaluated at UPLB, ( Morallo-Rejesus <foreign>
et al. </foreign> , 1993a), 20 plants show two or more biocidal actions (
Table 3).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#75:1>
The ten promising plants evaluated for biocidal activity by most
Asian countries are shown in Table 4. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#76:1>
<h> <bold> Field Efficacy Evaluation. </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#77:1>
In many cases, on-farm evaluations of botanical biocides were by
prophylactic treatments similar to the evaluation of synthetic pesticides.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#78:1>
Field trials are needed to determine the value of using botanical
pest control in the IPM system.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#79:1>
The trials should be on crops infested by target pests, replicated in
several locations, and designed, implemented and analyzed in the same manner
for all locations.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#80:1>
<foreign> Neem </foreign> has been field evaluated in several
locations in the Philippines, India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Indonesia, Nepal (
IRRI, 1992; Islam 1983).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#81:1>
Some field trials showed that <foreign> neem </foreign> is effective
against rice pests, including BPH, GLH and whorl maggot.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#82:1>
Other trials showed <foreign> neem </foreign> to be ineffective
against rice pests.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#83:1>
The differences could be due to the various sources of plants or
extractives, formulations used, and the species and level of pest
infestations.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#84:1>
This was also observed in the evaluation of <indig> makabuhai
</indig> in three regions of the Philippines ( Adalla <foreign> et al.
</foreign> , 1993). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#85:1>
<h> <bold> Phytotoxicity </bold> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#86:1>
The effect of the extractive with or without formulation on the seed
germination, seedling emergence, vegetative and reproductive vigor should be
determined on the host crop of the targeted pests.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#87:1>
Some data on the phytotoxicity of <foreign> neem </foreign> extracts
and formulations were reported by Singh ( 1993).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#88:1>
<foreign> Neem </foreign> seed kernel ( NSKE) suspension at 0.5%
caused no phytotoxicity on cabbage, tomato, peas, onion, cucurbits, wheat,
tobacco, rose, castor, litchi, fig, citrus, pomegranate, mango and maize.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#89:1>
NSKE at 5% was not phytotoxic to rice.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#90:1>
However, aqueous NSKE at 3% was phytotoxic to tobacco seedlings, and
<foreign> neem </foreign> oil at 10% to muskmelon at various stages of
growth. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#91:1>
<h> <bold> Formulation </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#92:1>
Botanical biocides are generally easily degraded under UV light.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#93:1>
This constraint may be overcome easily by formulation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#94:1>
This is a process of transforming a material into a product which can
be applied by practical methods to permit its effectiveness and economical
use.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#95:1>
The development of ready-to-use formulations is a must for easy
adoption of botanical biocides by farmers who find the preparation of
extractives to be cumbersome. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#96:1>
The material can be formulated as oil concentrates or solutions,
emulsifiable concentrates, aqueous concentrates, dusts, wettable powders,
granules, aerosols, seed dressings, poison baits, encapsulated formulations
and fertilizer mixtures.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#97:1>
Based on the report of Singh ( 1993), a tabulation of the different
formulations of <foreign> neem </foreign> is presented in Table 5.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#98:1>
<foreign> Neem </foreign> has been formulated for veterinary,
cosmetic and medicinal uses.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#99:1>
Five countries in Asia are formulating botanical biocides for farmers
use ( Table 6). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#100:1>
At the Entomology laboratory, three formulations of derris
containing either crude extract, active fraction or rotenone ( active
principle) were found to have reduced oral mammalian toxicity than the
unformulated extractive or rotenone ( Morallo-Rejesus 1994; Ocampo 1994).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#101:1>
These were also effective in the field against DBM of crucifers,
beanfly and corn fly maggots.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#102:1>
However, with the present government regulations on the use of
formulated products, I cannot officially recommend these to the farmers. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#103:1>
<h> <bold> Phytochemical Investigation </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#104:1>
Botanicals are natural products which are hard to standardize,
because of their inherent impurities and multiple chemical constituents.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#105:1>
The latter characteristics make the isolation and identification of
the chemical component(s) responsible for the activity complicated.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#106:1>
This difficulty can be overcome by international research
collaboration similar to <foreign> neem </foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#107:1>
The isolation and identification of the active principle(s) of
at least one component of chemical group are necessary to standardize and
determine the stability of the formulated product, the fate of the botanical
biocides in the environment and for registration.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#108:1>
For instance, the identification of azadirachtin, the principle
responsible for the antifeedant, IGR and ovicidal activity of <foreign> neem
</foreign> , crude extractives and active fractions of <foreign> neem
</foreign> seed have been formulated and standardized ( Larson 1986, Singh
1993). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#109:1>
In the interest of having cheap pest control agents and for
resistance management, it may be good if some variations and impurities
remain in botanical biocides.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#110:1>
The activity of isolated active fraction or active principle is less
than the crude extract or mixed fractions or principles.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#111:1>
This has been shown in <foreign> neem </foreign> and marigold.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#112:1>
In marigold, <foreign> ( <it> Tagetes </it> ssp. </foreign> - the
activity of Principle A ( 5-(3-buten-lynyl)2-2'bithienyl) or Principle B ( -
terthienyl) is less than the activity of A+B or active fraction against
diamondback moth and BPH ( Morallo-Rejesus and Eroles 1980; Morallo-Rejesus
and Decena, 1983).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#113:1>
Schmutterer ( 1992) reported that <it> <foreign> Azadirachtin
</foreign> </it> was less active than the <foreign> neem </foreign> oil or
seed bitters and showed different effects on the larvae/nymphs and adults of
insects. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-028#114:1>
Extractives formulation can be standardized based on biological
activity or specific activity as Sharma <foreign> et al. </foreign> ( 1983)
did with Neemrich I, II and III. </p> </I>
