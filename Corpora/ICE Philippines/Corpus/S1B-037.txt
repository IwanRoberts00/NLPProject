<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#61:1:A>
Excellent
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#62:1:A>
I was watching again <mention> American Beauty </mention> just last night and you know I have to add I didn't pay attention to the role of Annette Bening but she really is good in that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#63:1:B>
Yeah uhm 'cause initially <indig> para bang </indig> God this is an annoying character
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#64:1:B>
Yeah and she 's so shrill and

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#65:1:A>
On second viewing you realize hey
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#66:1:A>
Okay uh more directors any news about Roman Polanski

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#67:1:B>
Uhm oh I just saw the <mention> E News </mention> uh
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#68:1:B>
Was it it wasn't <mention> Mysteries and Scandals </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#69:1:B>
It was <mention> E News True Hollywood Stories </mention> which raked up his uhm statutory rape conviction in the States and so he fled to France right

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#70:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#71:1:B>
I don't know if he has already set foot in the States if they have cut some kind of deal but he can't go back to the States 'cause they 'll imprison him

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#72:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#73:1:B>
'Cause he has a standing conviction for statutory rape

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#74:1:A>
Isn't there a statute of limitations on this

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#75:1:B>
I don't know but I think that since uhm in the years after that conviction he has behaved pretty well uhm they could probably cut a deal some kind of deal but uh let 's see
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#76:1:B>
I saw his last movie <mention> The Ninth Gate </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#77:1:B>
Boy was it bad but it was kind of a fun bad movie because there are bad movies that are just uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#78:1:A>
Bad

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#79:1:B>
You know a complete waste of time but some movies are so bad they actually border on good 'cause they get to be fun
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#80:1:B>
And uhm I saw <mention> The Ninth Gate </mention> that was okay and I think the last really good movie Roman Polanski did was <mention> Tess </mention> and that was <,> shortly after he fled to Europe

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#81:1:A>
Nastassia Kinski <{> <[> yeah </[>

<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#103:1:B>

<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#124:1:A>
Yeah
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#125:1:A>
No my favorite is <mention> Scanners </mention> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#126:1:B>
Oh yes I have a special fondness for that movie in which heads explode

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#127:1:A>
<{> <[> Yeah </[>

<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#128:1:B>
<[> Brains fly </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#129:1:A>
The first time I saw Michael <?> Ironside </?> was in that movie
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#130:1:A>
I love that guy

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#131:1:B>
Yeah and <indig> di ba </indig> as as Noel Vicious pointed out you know David Cronenberg always the decay of the human body as seen in <mention> Scanners </mention> <mention> The Fly </mention> <{> <[> <mention> Dead Ringers </mention> <mention> <foreign> Existenz </foreign> </mention> </[> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#132:1:B>
What else uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#133:1:A>
<[> Uhm yeah yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#134:1:A>
<mention> Naked Lunch </mention> was

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#135:1:B>
<mention> Naked Lunch </mention> yes although well he also made <mention> M Butterfly </mention> which was just embarrassing 'cause there was no way in hell that anyone would be convinced that John Lone was a woman
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#136:1:B>
He 'd stubble <&> speaker A laughs </&> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#137:1:A>
Okay uhm
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#138:1:A>
Oh hold on
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#139:1:A>
What do you mean by an indie film an A film and a B film

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#140:1:B>
An <mention> indie </mention> is an independently financed movie
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#141:1:B>
It 's usually low budget because uhm you raise the funds yourself
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#142:1:B>
You don't go to a major Hollywood Studio <,> a studio being some uh a production uh uh a studio like <mention> Warner Brothers </mention> or <mention> Dreamworks </mention> or you know those things
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#143:1:B>
And then an A movie would be uhm I guess uh a mainstream <,> quality <,> type movie although Jean Claude Van Damme movies are considered A films right

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#144:1:A>
I don't know <O> laughter </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#145:1:B>
Not necessarily
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#146:1:B>
And then B movies are just those <,> think Michael Dudikoff

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#147:1:A>
Yeah that 's it <,> Mr B movie
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#148:1:A>
Uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#149:1:B>
Yeah what else

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#150:1:A>
I don't know

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#151:1:B>
And and then and there 's also these slight distinctions like David Haselhoff no matter what he does will always look like a B movie actor <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#152:1:B>
No matter <{> <[> how much success </[> he gets on T V he would always come off as B uh uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#153:1:A>
<[> Okay yeah poor guy </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#154:1:B>
Uh uh at least you know at least he can laugh at his own image

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#155:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1B-037#169:1:B>
Your expectations are way too high

 <$A>
