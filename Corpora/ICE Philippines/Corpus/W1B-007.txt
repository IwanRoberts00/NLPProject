<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#2:1>
Dearest Laureen,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#3:1>
Hi!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#4:1>
I 'm taking the time to write to you 'coz I was in DLSU the other day
and I saw your name on the board and I thought of writing to you. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#5:1>
So, how are you?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#6:1>
How are your studies?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#7:1>
I bet you 're busy catching up on your language classes or something
like that.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#8:1>
Is it already freezing there?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#9:1>
Sigh!!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#10:1>
I wish I could enjoy the snow with you. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#11:1>
By the way, my grandmother in the States is petitioning us
finally.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#12:1>
I don't know how it 's going though.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#13:1>
I think that we 're supposed to go there sometime in 1996 should
everything be approved.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#14:1>
Honestly, I want to go to the States already.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#15:1>
Marc is there.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#16:1>
Wyny is there.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#17:1>
And it 's probably a far cry from Manila life.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#18:1>
I 'll keep you posted on this although I do plan to finish my M.A. by
April 1997 <indig> pa </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#19:1>
So, we 'll see.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#20:1>
It 'll probably take ages before things get finalized with the
papers.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#21:1>
Plus I still have to take care of Carlo 's papers 'coz I want to take
him with me.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#22:1>
Marc told me to list down what I really want in my life and it 'll
probably come to pass.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#23:1>
Plus as long as I 'm dilly-dallying about my plans, nothing will
happen to them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#24:1>
I do plan to visit you in Japan though.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#25:1>
Is it feasible to visit you?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#26:1>
Will I have a place to stay in while I 'm there?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#27:1>
Is it really expensive?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#28:1>
Lastly, is it worth spending for? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#29:1>
What 's happening here?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#30:1>
The usual stuff: <indig> jeepney </indig> strikes, traffic, corrupt
politicians, bickerings, <foreign> etc. </foreign>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#31:1>
I think it really is best to immerse myself in books, movies and
cross-stitching rather than go out and be subject to all these negative
stuff.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#32:1>
Yup!!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#33:1>
I really believe that it 's only here in the Philippines that these
things do happen. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#34:1>
Nothing exciting with my life.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#35:1>
No love life as well.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#36:1>
I 'm just enjoying being myself and doing all these &ldquo; quiet
&rdquo; things.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#37:1>
Oh, by the way, I 've started a morning exercise ritual already.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#38:1>
It 's the pits!!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#39:1>
My body was really making creaking sounds.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#40:1>
Yup!!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#41:1>
I 'm not fit at the moment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#42:1>
The new semester will prove to be a lighter load for me.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#43:1>
And I think I 'll enjoy teaching my classes.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#44:1>
I have one cute male student who happens to be a very polite man.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#45:1>
I keep telling my friends that I 'll probably have sinful thoughts
about this person.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#46:1>
Heh heh heh! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#47:1>
Anyway, this will be all for now.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#48:1>
Do take care of yourself, okay?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#49:1>
I hope that you continue to have a grand time there.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#50:1>
Write when you can. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#51:1>
With much love and affection. ...

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#52:1>
As Always,

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#53:1>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#57:2>
Subject: Cosmic Journey

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#58:2>
Ton and I discovered new things in Baguio which I would like to
share with you in case you visit the place again. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#59:2>
Last weekend, we spent almost half-a-day at the Maryknoll
Ecological Sanctuary. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#60:2>
The place was developed only in the last two or three years and
it 's been a regular destination of local and foreign tourists as well as
school children on their science, culture and religious field trips.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#61:2>
But how could these three - - - science, culture and religion - - -
be integrated in one outdoor activity? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#62:2>
That 's the pioneering work of the Maryknoll Sisters in Baguio.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#63:2>
The eco-tour we had is called <mention> &ldquo; Cosmic Journey
&rdquo; </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#64:2>
It was such a wonderful experience for all of us, eight Ateneo
teachers and Ton, and I would highly recommend that you arrange for the
guided tour.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#65:2>
What made it wonderful, at least for me, is not so much on knowing
new facts about the earth for many of these we already know, but on gaining
new insights about our lives, our environment, and most especially how God
had all along planned this evolution. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#66:2>
When we were told <mention> &ldquo; cosmic &rdquo; </mention> ,
we immediately associated it with astronomy.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#67:2>
Ton and I thought what else could be new when we had seen the air and
space museum in Washington and the NASA in Houston.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#68:2>
But anyway, we kept our minds open and our disposition cheerful. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#69:2>
Later as we went through the experience, we discovered that this
eco-tour is unique in the sense that it is natural science with spiritual and
cultural recollection. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#70:2>
After the 1991 earthquake, according to our tour guide Sr. Ann
Braudis, the convent of the Maryknoll sisters was badly damaged.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#71:2>
So what they did was to capitalize on the ruins and on the natural
landscape of the hill on which the convent used to stand, and develop a
nature trail with 14 stations.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#72:2>
Not stations of the cross.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#73:2>
Each station is like a garden corner where our guide engages us in an
amusing and insightful storytelling.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#74:2>
Each garden station has either wooden benches or rocks to sit on,
usually in a circular arrangement, with an object of interest at the center.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#75:2>
Her stories usually revolve around this object. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#76:2>
For example, the fifth station is entitled <mention> &ldquo;
Mammals Arrive &rdquo; </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#77:2>
In that garden, there is an antique wooden sculpture of a mother
elephant of about 3 feet high with a baby elephant beside it.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#78:2>
Ton was able to take a photo of this.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#79:2>
We sat on the big rocks surrounding these elephants, and like little
children, listened to Sr. Ann 's story of the evolution of mammals millions
of years ago.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#80:2>
In almost all the stations, she usually starts off with the
scientific facts.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#81:2>
Then she brings the discussion into a more soulful experience. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#82:2>
At this point, she drew out the values that were developed when
mammals arrived.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#83:2>
Parenting.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#84:2>
Caring for young ones.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#85:2>
Sensitivity to the family 's needs.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#86:2>
And by this time, she was talking as if she 's giving a retreat to
each of us and made us personally reflect on these values.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#87:2>
She paused every now and then, which made me wonder at the depth of
her spirituality...

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#88:2>
Then she went further to say that they put the wooden elephants in
that garden for the public to know that elephants existed in the northern
provinces, probably even in the Cordillera mountains thousands of years ago!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#89:2>
And it is so unfortunate that they have been driven to extinction in
these places.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#90:2>
She cited as evidence the indigenous artworks made by the early
tribesmen.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#91:2>
Somehow, she commented, it is difficult to explain how these early
people were able to carve these images if they had not actually seen them.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#92:2>
And if I remember correctly, she also mentioned that fossils have
been uncovered that make them believe all the more this theory.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#93:2>
And when we recall that there are still elephants today in some
corners of Southeast Asia, and relate this to the theory of the land bridges
that connected the thousands of islands in the region, then it is no longer
difficult to convince us that elephants might have indeed been among the
early inhabitants of this place. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#94:2>
So that is another thing that makes Sr. Ann 's storytelling
interesting.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#95:2>
She contextualizes natural science history with the Philippine
anthropological history.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#96:2>
So we get to appreciate our own country and culture. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#97:2>
Moving from one station to another meant trekking up and down the
gently-sloping hill and even crossing a suspension bridge with rope-rails to
hold on and wooden steps to walk on!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#98:2>
That put a little excitement in the journey. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#99:2>
Well, actually, for those with height problems, the architects
made the bridge secure by providing some steel support.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#100:2>
No longer indigenous but extra safety measures especially for
children. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#101:2>
But before we crossed this bridge, we passed by the ninth and
tenth stations, respectively called <mention> &ldquo; Early Humans Live in
Caves &rdquo; </mention> and <mention> &ldquo; The Hunting and Gathering Age
&rdquo; </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#102:2>
Here we climbed up on firm steps of stone until we found ourselves
into a small Ifugao burial cave!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#103:2>
Eerie!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#104:2>
Although the cave was man-made, it looks almost real.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#105:2>
Our guide talked about rituals and burial practices, and their team 's
plan to eventually &ldquo; decorate &rdquo; this cave with burial jars.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#106:2>
Empty, I hope.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#107:2>
We stayed inside only for a short time for which I am glad.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#108:2>
Not much to see anyway, but so much to imagine anyhow. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#109:2>
Then we climbed up further to a replica of the Tabon caves of
Palawan.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#110:2>
We stayed here for quite awhile sitting on big stones.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#111:2>
The cave looked more hospitable.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#112:2>
Sr. Ann narrated to us how some early cavemen lived.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#113:2>
In all their primitiveness, she explained, early human beings
appreciated beauty.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#114:2>
One can see it in the way they chose their dwelling places.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#115:2>
They chose to live in caves aesthetically designed by nature to be
pleasing to their eyes.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#116:2>
They also chose caves which face magnificent views like the blue
sea.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#117:2>
Facing the west, the Tabon men must have marvelled at the sight of
the awesome sunset at the horizon of the South China sea.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#118:2>
Later we learned that Maryknoll has a research team engaged in
extensive studies on the Tabon men. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#119:2>
Living and gathering together in caves, these early human beings
developed Language and rituals.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#120:2>
Sr. Ann brought the discussion deeper for us to realize the value of
language and communication.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#121:2>
The age of language and communication is one of the longest, dating
back to these primitives up to today. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#122:2>
By this time, one would have noticed already that Sr. Ann uses
so many hand gestures.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#123:2>
Out of habit, I guess, since they normally relate with deaf
children.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#124:2>
I could also surmise that they bring these children to this place
also. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#125:2>
After that, we walked along a narrow path and crossed the bridge
I mentioned towards a sample Ifugao or Igorot village, with authentic Ifugao
huts!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#126:2>
One of these is elevated, though I can't remember if it was anchored
on a tree, and Sr. Ann invited us to climb it and rest inside it to have a
feel of how the early tribesmen lived.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#127:2>
It was ingenious how the natives designed the posts on which their
huts stood to prevent rats from climbing up. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#128:2>
Sr. Ann, by the way, is very energetic even though she must be
in her late 40s or 50s.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#129:2>
My guess is that she 's an American who had long been stationed in
the Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#130:2>
And by the way she talks, she must be in love with our country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#131:2>
The small village only has three huts, each one perhaps
representing a design by a different tribe.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#132:2>
Sr. Ann said that they hired local old natives to work on these, so
they tried to be as faithful to the indigenous form and function.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#133:2>
Needless to say, the development of this nature trail was done with
the assistance of some consultants.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#134:2>
As an aside, part of the funds came from the sale of a small
Maryknoll property in Quezon City. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#135:2>
So, that is only a preview.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#136:2>
The next time you are in Baguio, be sure to visit the Maryknoll
Ecological Sanctuary.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#137:2>
Don't expect anything spectacular.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#138:2>
Nothing high tech. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#139:2>
At the entrance of this friendly mini-forest park, there is only
one rule written on a wooden board: <quote> &ldquo; Those who enter here. ...
Enjoy! &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#140:2>
Their brochure says <quote> &ldquo; The Cosmic Journey is an
experience of the origins of the earth and its inhabitants. ... <X>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#X141:2>
More than a physical journey through a nature trail, it is a
journey into our inner selves. .... challenges us to reassess our role and
relationship with the Universe, and to refashion our way of life in
conformity with nature. &rdquo; </X> </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#142:2>
This may sound deep but the Maryknoll sisters have a way of drawing
the children 's enthusiasm for non-formal experiential learning. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#143:2>
By the way, this is not a passive tour.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#144:2>
Don't expect to just look and listen.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#145:2>
The tourists are encouraged to participate.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#146:2>
In fact, in the first station <mention> &ldquo; The Universe comes
into Being &rdquo; </mention> , Sr. Ann, as well as our group, was amusingly
surprised that Ton just suddenly walked towards the huge antique rusty
<indig> &ldquo; batingaw &rdquo; </indig> and tested if it still works.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#147:2>
Donnngggg!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#148:2>
It works alright, the sister remarked.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#149:2>
She laughed at Ton 's childlike spontaneity and curiosity.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#150:2>
She said, <quote> &ldquo; I 've been asking guests to come and try
this bell, and they are usually shy to do it. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#151:2>
The guided tour only costs &peso;35.00 per head.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#152:2>
Really cheap for an interesting experience.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#153:2>
The nature trail took us around 2 hours.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#154:2>
At the end of the journey, it is like having undergone a
recollection.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#155:2>
It connects God with nature and with culture. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#156:2>
For those interested, the telephone number of the Maryknoll
office in Baguio is ( 074) 442-4602.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#157:2>
Be sure to ask about the schedule of their guided tour by one of the
sisters.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#158:2>
They can also make their own schedules for you.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#159:2>
It is located at
#27 Sto. Tomas Road, Campo Sioco.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#160:2>
That is near Legarda Road, just before you exit to the Marcos
Highway.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#161:2>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#162:2>
It is safe for children, as long as there are accompanying
adults.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#163:2>
But I don't know how young is their youngest visitor or how old is
their oldest.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#164:2>
You can ask them that. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#165:2>
The Maryknoll office also has an art gallery, and they regularly
change their exhibits.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#166:2>
The theme is of course nature.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#167:2>
When we were there we looked at the paintings of deaf children and
photo-exhibit by professionals including the famous BenCab.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#168:2>
You can buy these.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#169:2>
Other features of the place include an Earth Resource Center,
small-scale camping areas, seminar center, picnic area, and living facilities
for retreat or special workshop participants. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-007#170:2>
For instance this summer, their program includes &ldquo;
Eco-Vacation", on April 11-14, &ldquo; Growth and Wellness Workshop Series
&rdquo; on April 17-19, Earth Day Celebration on April 22 and the &ldquo;
Sanctuary Eco-Retreat &rdquo; on May 5-7. </p> </I>
