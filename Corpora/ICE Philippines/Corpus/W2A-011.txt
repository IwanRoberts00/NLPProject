<bold> Filomeno V. Aguilar, Jr. </bold> <O> four quotations </O>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#3:1>
Better opportunities in a new place, separation from family and
community, marital dissolution, emotional attachment between server and
served: these themes could well be those of today 's Filipino overseas
contract workers ( OCWs), and the statements cited above could well have been
uttered in the context of present-day international labor migration.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#4:1>
But, in fact, they belong to a different era.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#5:1>
Appearing in the admirable study by James Warren ( 1981) from where I
had culled the above extracts, these statements were recorded in the context
of the slave raiding and slave-master relationship as practiced by the Sulu
Sultanate in the late nineteenth century.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#6:1>
The slave workers in Sulu 's external-trade driven economy were
captured from various parts subsumed in what today we call <mention>
Southeast Asia </mention> - - Ilocos, Cavite, Cebu, Catanduanes, Albay,
Samar, Iloilo, Menado, Gorontalo, Bugis, Moluccas, Makassar, Kelantan,
Patani, etc. - - and forcibly brought to the Sulu zone.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#7:1>
As coerced migrants, the Sulu slaves spent a life of captivity
vestiges of which may be observed in the contemporary OCW phenomenon ( cf.
Hing this volume).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#8:1>
Certainly, Sulu 's slavery and present-day contract labor migration
share a common ancestry in global capitalism, albeit issuing from different
stages of its revolution.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#9:1>
But one aspect that was conspicuously absent in the reports of roughly
a century ago was the sense of national identity on the part of the slaves.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#10:1>
Abducted from various parts of the Philippines and island Southeast
Asia, they were treated equally as <it> <indig> banyaga </indig> </it> ( "
chattel-slaves", Warren 1981:215).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#11:1>
The slaves themselves did not express their social identities in the
anachronistic categories of <mention> 'Filipino', 'Indonesian', 'malaysian',
or 'Thai' </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#12:1>
Whatever geographic attachments they cherished were limited to the
highly specific entities of family or village or to the ports or townships
from where they had originated.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#13:1>
Ethnic identities were then extremely fluid in Sulu as elsewhere in
the region. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#14:1>
Of the innumerable quotes cited by Warren, only one referring to
a Spaniard betrayed any identification with a nation: <X> <quote> &ldquo; The
Spaniard had lived for fifteen years in the interior of [ Sulu], where his
master treated him very well, and his only reason for escaping was an
unconquerable yearning to behold his native country once again &rdquo;
</quote> </X> ( Warren 1981:250).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#15:1>
I find this brief quote suggestive of the man 's sense of territorial
bond with his homeland, the nativeness of which became even clearer and
dearer to him from the remoteness of his captivity in Sulu.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#16:1>
But in longing to see his literal country and not necessarily those
dear to him ( who might not be traceable after fifteen years, or whose lives
might have taken a course with which he would not be happy), his cognitive
nation was characterized by the erasure of people.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#17:1>
But the physical terrain of his land of birth was different for,
despite the years of separation, it could be imagined as unchanging and
eternally welcoming, probably buttressed by the vision of a map that remained
vivid in his memory, his native land thus becoming the object of the fondest
yearning.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#18:1>
The Spanish slave 's love of nation as expressed in the naturalistic
vocabulary of the homeland, following Benedict Anderson 's ( 1991:142-4)
argument, is rather analogous to Jose Rizal 's <it> <foreign> patria
</foreign> </it> in his &ldquo; <it> <foreign> Ultimo Adios </foreign> </it>
&ldquo; in which the great patriot, while awaiting his execution, said his
moving farewell to a nation literally of land and sea.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#19:1>
Apart from this Spaniard, however, the reports on the other slaves in
the Sulu Sultanate quoted by Warren showed no affective ties to a modern
nation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#20:1>
Also markedly absent was any personal or collective feeling of shame
at their enslavement.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#21:1>
On the contrary, it was not unusual for slaves to feel contented at
the fair treatment they received and to relish the material advantages they
reaped from their forced migration. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#22:1>
At about the same period of history, however, at the other side
of the globe the young and wealthy <it> <foreign> ilustrados </foreign> </it>
from the Spanish Philippines who lived in Europe, mainly to obtain a
university degree, were displaying passions that were undoubtedly tied to an
emergent nationhood.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#23:1>
A number of newspapers in Spain printed articles the <it> <foreign>
ilustrados </foreign> </it> found offensive and insulting not just to their
individual persons but to a collectivity - - the 'Filipino people', <it>
<foreign> los indios bravos </foreign> </it> - - with whom the mainly Chinese
<foreign> mestizo </foreign> <it> <foreign> ilustrados </foreign> </it>
identified ( cf. Schumacher 1973:55-56, 213-6).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#24:1>
For instance, the Filipino was pictured as <quote> &ldquo; no more
than a big child...lacking even the beard which is the sign of virility in a
race &rdquo; </quote> , and his supposed racial inferiority was further
underscored: <X> <quote> &ldquo; What does the poor <it> <foreign> indio
</foreign> </it> , weak in body and weak in mind...understand of all this
chatter of motherhood and brotherhood, of civilization and of culture?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#X25:1>
...Bodies without clothes, brains without ideas...an inanimate heap
of human entities... &rdquo; </quote> </X> ( <it> <foreign> Ibid. </foreign>
</it> .:56). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#26:1>
In response to one such slew of invectives, Antonio Luna, after
failing to obtain the right to reply to a &ldquo; series of insults &rdquo;
from a Spanish writer, recounted in a letter addressed to Rizal dated 26
November 1889 that he <quote> &ldquo; felt the compelling need to look for
Mir Deas and spit on his face &rdquo; </quote> ( Terra 1996).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#27:1>
Luna 's letter reported that:

<p> <quote> Upon finding him, I asked who he was ( as I did not know him), I
told him he was dishonourable, a coward, a despicable low-life. <X>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#X28:1>
I spat at him, then flung my calling card on his bespattered face.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#X29:1>
The result: a lot of disorder, confusion and riot... </quote> </p>

<p> <quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#X30:1>
The series of insults which he directed at me asked for no other
reply than what I did.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#X31:1>
With luck, I hope he accepts my challenge to a duel....

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#X32:1>
In this way, I would like to show that we Filipinos have more honour
than the cringeing [ sic], grovelling ... coward... </quote> </p>

<p> <quote> I think I am satisfied that by doing this our dignity would be
enhanced... </quote> </p> <quote> This is called for, it is unavoidable if he
continues to malign the good name of the Filipino </quote> </X> ( <it>
<foreign> Ibid. </foreign> </it> ) .

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#33:1>
After making an appeal to Rizal and other compatriots then in
Paris ( whom he expected would be reading his letter) to support their own
paper, the <it> <foreign> La Solidaridad </foreign> </it> , by taking out
subscriptions, Luna 's last line read: <X> <quote> &ldquo; Greetings to all
and share the news with our fellow countrymen &rdquo; </quote> </X> ( <it>
<foreign> Ibid. </foreign> </it> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#34:1>
Clearly, the expatriate Luna like Rizal had cultivated the national
imagination: shared by these <it> <foreign> ilustrado </foreign> </it> exiles
was the conception of a community, an anonymous mass of countrymen linked by
a common land of birth.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#35:1>
More than that, these fellow sojourners in Europe were imagined as
sharing the same sentiment of revulsion at the racial slurs that maligned
&ldquo; the good name of the Filipino. &rdquo; Luna could probably envisage
his countrymen identifying with his bruised feelings and cheering him on for
the feat of bravery and retribution he had singlehandedly achieved on behalf
of them all.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#36:1>
Hence his reminder to Rizal to <quote> &ldquo; share the news.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#37:1>
The Sulu slaves and the <it> <foreign> ilustrados </foreign>
</it> demonstrate contrasting patterns of migration and nationalism in the
late nineteenth century.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#38:1>
The early Philippine nationalists reacted to the felt humiliation at
the racial abuse of an inchoate collectivity they believed defined their
social identity.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#39:1>
Among the peripatetic elements of the native intelligentsia, the
feeling was most acute in the imperial metropole where they aspired to prove
their parity with and gain acceptance from the colonial overlords.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#40:1>
The insults that negated such aspirations seemed to have strengthened
the perception of separateness and difference, as well as the resolve to
defend the dignity and honor of the Filipino as defined by the <it> <foreign>
ilustrados </foreign> </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#41:1>
From its early beginnings Philippine elite nationalism was thus
intertwined with colonial racism, resulting in a profound sensitivity to the
shaming of the nation-cum-race and in an insecurity borne of the Filipino
<foreign> mestizo </foreign> elite 's internalization of such racism (
Aguilar 1995).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#42:1>
In contrast, the fishermen, peasants and artisans enslaved in Sulu at
the same historical period were positively unaffected by any notion of
nationalism.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#43:1>
But neither were the <it> <foreign> ilustrados </foreign> </it>
concerned about the Sulu social system which was virtually unlinked to the
elite 's concept of the nation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#44:1>
At the close of the twentieth century, the embeddedness of
nationalism in migratory movements is unravelling in new dimensions.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#45:1>
Educated Filipinos overseas of middle and upper class extraction - -
regardless of political persuasion - - are anxious that the Filipino diaspora
has compromised what they perceive to be the dignity and honor of the nation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#46:1>
Some elite nationalists outrightly refer to the OCW phenomenon as an
embarrassment to the nation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#47:1>
Writing from New York, Ninotchka Rosca calls the participation of
Filipinas in the international labor market as the Philippines ' <mention>
&ldquo; shameful export &rdquo; </mention> ( Rosca 1995).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#48:1>
How I came across Luna 's letter is instructive of other elite
attempts to come to terms with bruised national feelings.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#49:1>
In a news feature entitled <mention> &ldquo; Bad Press, 19th Century
&rdquo; </mention> that appeared in &ldquo; <it> The Filipino </it> &ldquo; (
published in London with a readership in other parts of Europe), Luna 's
letter was quoted in full, but in its English translation, precisely to
encourage <quote> &ldquo; Filipinos in Europe [ who] are regular recipients
of deprecating, racist and abusive coverage by the media, whether it be in
the news, documentaries or comedy skits &rdquo; </quote> ( Terra 1996).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#50:1>
The aim was to reawaken the spirit of Luna among the paper 's largely
middle-class readership most of whom merely &ldquo; endure &rdquo; the
&ldquo; racist drivel, &rdquo; &ldquo; shrug if off, &rdquo; or rationalize
the abuse &ldquo; philosophically &rdquo; ( <it> <foreign> Ibid. </foreign>
</it> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#51:1>
In other words, well-heeled Filipino migrants in Europe are
immobilized by attacks on their social identities, as if insults and
humiliation are the common lot of the Filipino. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#52:1>
In contrast, the contract workers, this time free migrants
compared with Sulu 's slave captives, do not necessarily see - - despite
individual misfortunes - - their own sojourn overseas as a tragedy for the
nation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#53:1>
But, unlike the Sulu case, international labor migration has a strong
connection to nationness, hence to the broader pattern of
transnationalization ( Basch <it> et al. </it> 1994).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#54:1>
&ldquo; Bro. Gino, &rdquo; the columnist who gives public advice in
the tabloid <it> News Today </it> in response to letters from OCWs, counsels
migrant workers in the post-Contemplacion era: <quote> <X> <it> <indig> Kung
gagawa tayo ng kapalpakan, hindi lamang pangalan natin ang mapapasama kundi
pati ang ating lahi </indig> </it> </X> ( if we misbehave or do something
wrong, it is not only our name that will be tarnished but our race) </quote>
( Dormiendo 1995;3).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#55:1>
Apart from negative individual behavior ( <it> <indig> kapalpakan
</indig> </it> ) that may reflect badly on &ldquo; our race &rdquo; - -
nationality and race are here conflated - - going overseas for employment is
not deemed by the contract worker to be a shameful act.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#56:1>
That the labor migrant moves about with the badge of his or her
nationality is, however, irrefutable. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#57:1>
The scattering of Filipinos to various corners of the planet has
undoubtedly exerted a profound impact on national identity and consciousness,
affecting the non-migrant population in the Philippines as well as the
different classes of migrants overseas.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#58:1>
This essay explores recent changes in the Filipino world view while
seeking to analyze the interconnections between the international migration
of labor, Filipino nationhood, and what may be broadly termed as <mention>
social class </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#59:1>
The thoughts and propositions laid out here have been influenced
unavoidably by my own personal experiences of having lived in several
countries in the course of my studies and working life, although my stay
overseas has been punctuated by annual visits to the Philippines lasting
several weeks.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#60:1>
In writing this article, I have also drawn from formal interviews and
casual conversations with Filipino professionals and domestic workers in
Singapore, where I lived for three years from 1993 to 1996.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#61:1>
In the sections that follow, I discuss what I observe to be the
transformations in the Filipino national imagination, the imprint of the
exilic experience upon the national identities of Filipino workers overseas,
and the contestatory challenge posed by ordinary OCWs to the definitions of
the nation preferred by Filipino elites and professionals. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#62:1>
<h> <it> Nationness and serialization </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#63:1>
As Anderson ( 1991:166) notes, Filipino nationalism <quote>
&ldquo; has been, for a century now, on the trail of an aboriginal Eden,
&rdquo; </quote> in other words, stunted in its growth, unable to move beyond
its embryonic stage following the symbolic birth of the nation in 1896.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#64:1>
This predicament of Filipino nationalism I attribute not merely to
the stultifying effects of colonial racism nor to the relative weakness of
the Philippine state, but more fundamentally to the aborted serialization and
pluralization of the national imagination of the Filipino.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#65:1>
As can be learnt from Anderson 's ( 1991) brilliant study, the birth
of the modern nation did not occur in obscurity or isolation but rather the
national idea emerged when its creole pioneers were enabled in the late
eighteenth century to envisage, through print-capitalism and bodily journeys
through administrative state structures and spaces, the territorial
jurisdiction in the Americas as constituting separate imagined communities.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#66:1>
Bound by the fatality of birth outside Europe, the innumerable but
finite members of each of the national communities formed a comradeship
distinguishable as the creole 'us' from the metropolitan 'them'.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#67:1>
Territorialized, relativized and serialized, the dynastic realism in
Europe subsequently underwent a similar horizontal transformation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#68:1>
But the relativization of the national political community
necessitated the existence of other entities from which the nation could be
conceptualized as a community apart, from which the nation could be
differentiated by its supposed uniqueness shared by everyone within but not
by those without.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#69:1>
Thus the birth of the national idea occurred in a historical epoch in
which a number of nations were forming coevally involving the simultaneous
processes of inclusion and exclusion.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#70:1>
National consciousness emerged in a world of plurals: an
indispensable prerequisite to the nation was its Others. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#71:1>
Moreover, the nation was given discursive and pictorial
representation as a person framed in social intercourse with other nations-
<it> <foreign> qua </foreign> </it> - persons on an international stage.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#72:1>
The embodiment of collective identity, the nation was seen as part of
a series of other nations, all of them imaginable as persons that by their
very existence constituted a so-called <mention> 'community of nations'
</mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#73:1>
Emerging from the absolutist past, modern nationalism partook of the
ideology of individualism accentuated and legitimated by capitalist relations
of production: nations were thought to be separate, unique, and equal, a
dogma that translated into the political principle of national sovereignty.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#74:1>
Nonetheless, international parity was always unstable in a collection
of individuals not connected, indeed separated, by nationality since, much
like individual persons, nations competed for ranking and dominance in a
hierarchized world.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#75:1>
In any event, sufficient human qualities were projected onto the
nation, despite its being a reified object of representation, a subject of
devotion, as well as an empirical political reality, such that the nation
could be concomitantly fetishized as though it were like you and me.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-011#76:1>
The consequence has been that, as Geoffrey Benjamin ( 1988:12)
observes, <quote> &ldquo; international relations have been conducted as if
they were inter- <it> personal </it> relations, to the extent that as much
attention must now be paid to a country 's supposed honour and shame as to
its economic or political condition. &rdquo; </quote> </p> </I>
