Excerpts from the De La Salle University Student Handbook

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#2:1>
<h> <bold> Section 4: Social Norms </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#3:1>
Each student of the University is expected to act as a mature
Christian at all times, whether on or off campus, showing respect for proper
authority, for the rights of fellow students, and for the good name of the
University.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#4:1>
To ensure an atmosphere conducive to the formation of Filipino
Christian men and women, and to maintain an order necessary for the common
good, students are expected to adhere to the following norms: </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#5:1>
4.1. Students are given the liberty to dress according to their
individual tastes but they are urged to adhere to the conventions of good
grooming.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#6:1>
The following are considered attires offensive to the sensibility of
other members of the academic community: <indig> sandos </indig> , plunging
necklines, halter tops, bicycle shorts, leggings, pants with holes, PE shorts
and athletic shorts ( except during PE), very short shorts ( with hem higher
than 4 inches above the top of the kneecap), clothes with frayed hems,
slippers, sleeveless shirts with wide and loose armholes, and micro-mini
skirts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#7:1>
4.1.1. P.E. shorts should be worn only during P.E. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#8:1>
4.1.2. Wearing of inappropriate student campus attire shall be
considered a minor offense. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#9:1>
4.2. In dealing with all the members of the university community,
students are expected to observe the usual norms of politeness, etiquette,
and courtesy.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#10:1>
Faculty members, administrators, or staff members, in their
obligation to exercise the judgment of good parents, <foreign> in loco
parentis </foreign> , may call the attention of students who display
unbecoming behavior in campus or during officially sanctioned University
activities outside campus. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#11:1>
4.3. Students should follow the usual classroom policies and
procedures as well as those pre-set by the teacher.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#12:1>
The latter should have been communicated to and accepted by the
students.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#13:1>
Students who violate the above may be sent out of class.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#14:1>
Such students must then report to the Director of Discipline.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#15:1>
A student sent out of the class must carry a written note from the
Director of Discipline authorizing him/her to re-enter class at the next
meeting.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#16:1>
Students absent for reasons indicated here are to be marked <mention>
&ldquo; Absent &rdquo; </mention> for all sessions missed.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#17:1>
Persistent occurrences of this type of behavior render the student
liable to being asked by the University Discipline Board to discontinue
classes, with a grade of 0.0 for that particular course. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#18:1>
4.4. Boisterous conduct, whistling, running or any action by
students which tends to distract other students from ongoing activities in
class is to be avoided. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#19:1>
4.5. The blackboard and chalk are to be used only for
instructional and official announcements from school authorities.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#20:1>
Feet should be kept off furniture and walls, and equipment should be
handled with reasonable care and properly stored after use.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#21:1>
Smoking, eating, drinking and playing cards in classrooms are
prohibited. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#22:1>
4.6. It is expected that respect and deference be shown to all
visitors on campus.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#23:1>
The usual norms of etiquette, as well as all posted directions,
should be carefully observed in classrooms, in the library, in the canteens,
in dealing with administrative and office personnel, with members of the
faculty and their staff, coeds and the security guards. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#24:1>
4.7. It is considered unethical for any student to make any
unfavorable remark towards another, including sexist remarks.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#25:1>
Areas exclusively used by men/women which are marked accordingly (
ladies ' and men 's rooms) are off limits to the opposite sex. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#26:1>
4.8. Healthy interaction with members of the opposite sex is
encouraged by the University Administration.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#27:1>
However, acts or gestures which tend to offend other members of the
community, including public display of physical intimacy, are not tolerated.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#28:1>
4.9. The University encourages student use of campus facilities
for business meetings and for social, cultural and recreational activities.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#29:1>
At the same time, it also holds that it has a corresponding right to
deny the use of facilities to those who are unable or unwilling to abide by
University regulations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#30:1>
4.10. Students who invite guests from outside the campus ( e. g.
lecturers, speakers, seminar participants) are requested to submit a visitors
list to the Office of the AVP for Administrative Services, indicating the
names of campus visitors, the purpose of their visit, and the expected time
of their arrival.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#31:1>
This will be forwarded to the security-on-detail for proper
information.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#32:1>
Guests should be accorded the proper courtesy due their position or
rank at all times. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#33:1>
4.11. Any report of a student exhibiting unbecoming behavior
automatically brings about an inquiry by the Director of Discipline.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#34:1>
Such action may render a student liable to be discharged from the
University, upon investigation by the University Discipline Board. </p> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#35:1>
4.11.1. Any student exhibiting behavior with indications of
psychological imbalance may be referred to a counselor.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#36:1>
The counselor, after an initial assessment, may bring the case to the
attention of the Guidance Director if the student is found to be a
threat/danger to himself/herself and others.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#37:1>
The Guidance Director in turn may convene a committee, whose members
are appointed based on the circumstances surrounding the case, to evaluate
and make recommendations to the Dean concerned on how the student can be
helped.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#38:1>
The Dean, upon relevant consultation, may make a decision on whether
to allow the student to enroll or to go on leave.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#39:1>
This decision is final and executory. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#40:1>
4.12. Students may not participate in any outside activity,
contest, play, band, orchestra, choir, conference, association, society, or
group as a representative of the University or any of its recognized student
organizations, without written authorization by the Dean of Student Affairs.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#41:1>
Participation in activities as individuals and not as representatives
of the University is, of course, not contemplated in this reservation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#42:1>
4.13. Students may release to the press, or similar channels of
public communications, notices of University or student activities upon
securing a clearance from the Dean of Student Affairs and furnishing a copy
of the same. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#43:1>
4.14. Hazing and initiation activities which clearly inflict
bodily and/or psychological harm or demean the dignity of the individual are
not allowed.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#44:1>
Such an act constitutes a major offense and is subject to the
disciplinary sanctions listed in this handbook.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#45:1>
The University is not responsible for the actions of students who on
their own, without regard for the existing law, and despite awareness of
possible grave punitive sanctions, will engage in such activities, either
actively or passively. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#46:1>
<h> 4.15. Guidelines on Academic Honesty </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#47:1>
<h> Preparation of Papers and Other Works: Plagiarism </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#48:1>
All work submitted--homework assignments, papers,
examinations--is expected to be the student 's own work.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#49:1>
Students should always take great care to distinguish their own ideas
and knowledge from information derived from sources.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#50:1>
The term <mention> &ldquo; sources &rdquo; </mention> includes not
only published primary and secondary material, but also information and
opinions gained directly from other people.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#51:1>
The responsibility for learning the proper forms of citation lies
with the individual student.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#52:1>
Quotations must be properly placed within quotation marks and must be
completely acknowledged.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#53:1>
Whenever ideas or facts are derived from a student 's reading and
research, the sources must be indicated. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#54:1>
A student who reiterates or draws on ideas or facts used in
another paper that he or she is writing, or has written, must cite that other
paper as a source. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#55:1>
A computer program written to satisfy a course requirement is,
like a paper, expected to be original work of the student submitting it.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#56:1>
Copying a program from another student or any other source is a form
of academic dishonesty, as is deriving a program substantially from the work
of another. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#57:1>
A student 's papers and other work are expected to be submitted
to only one course.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#58:1>
If the same or similar work is to be submitted to any other course,
the prior written permission of the instructor must be obtained.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#59:1>
If the same or similar term, the prior written permission of all
instructors involved must be obtained. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#60:1>
( Adopted from the Harvard University handbook through the INTERNET)

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#61:1>
4.16. The university recognizes the value of being genuinely
concerned for the environment.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#62:1>
All members of the University are encouraged to observe practices
which put this value into action. </p> <O> Section 5. </O>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#63:1>
<h> <bold> Section 6: Attendance </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#64:1>
6.1. Prompt and regular attendance in all classes is required of
all students from the first meeting of every course. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#65:1>
6.2. A student is considered absent from class if he/she is not
present within the first third fraction of the scheduled time but not to
exceed thirty minutes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#66:1>
Thus, a student is considered absent if he/she arrives after:

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#67:1>
20 minutes for a 60-minute class;

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#68:1>
30 minutes for a 90 to 180 minute class ( laboratory or lecture) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#69:1>
6.3. A student is considered late or tardy and receives a
half-absence if he arrives in class during the first third fraction of the
scheduled class time, <foreign> i.e. </foreign> if he arrives within the time
schedule described above.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#70:1>
A half-absence may be added to another half-absence to make a full
absence recorded against a student. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#71:1>
6.4. Although members of the faculty are expected to begin their
classes promptly, various contingencies which are sometimes unavoidable may
cause some faculty members to be late for class.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#72:1>
In such cases, the following guidelines are to be observed: </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#73:1>
6.4.1. For 60-minute classes, students should not leave until
after 20 minutes; for 90 to 180-minute classes, students should wait 30
minutes.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#74:1>
Students may be marked absent by a professor if they leave their
classes earlier than the prescribed time. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#75:1>
6.5. Students render themselves ineligible for a passing grade in
a given subject for the trimester if they are absent from class for more than
two and a half times the number of class meetings in a week, such as: more
than 12-1/2 times in a class meeting five times a week; more than 10 times
for a class meeting four times a week; more than 7-1/2 times for a class
meeting thrice a week; more than five times for a class meeting twice a week;
more than 2-1/2 for a class meeting once a week. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#76:1>
6.6. Regulations regarding approved absences are as follows:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#77:1>
6.6.1. An approved absence is one authorized through an Approved
Absence Form by the Dean of Student Affairs because the student concerned has
officially represented his/her duly accredited organization ( with the
recommendation of the Director of Student Activities) and/or the University (
with the recommendation of an Administrator) at some function or activity.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#78:1>
6.6.2. Absences due to sickness, even if duly certified by a
doctor, parent, or guardian, are not considered approved absences and should
therefore be counted against the student 's attendance.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#79:1>
However, a faculty member may give special consideration to a student
who has been absent due to sickness before giving him/her a grade of 0.0 in
cases where the student, aside from showing great scholastic aptitude, has
been consistently performing well.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#80:1>
For absences due to prolonged illness, a student, or his/her duly
authorized representative, must notify the Associate Dean as soon as
possible. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#81:1>
6.6.3. In case of an approved absence, the event is recorded in
the faculty class record, but such absence is not counted toward a student 's
<mention> &ldquo; excess, &rdquo; </mention> as indicated in Section 6.5.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#82:1>
6.7 A student is held responsible for all assignments and for the
entire content of the course missed, regardless of the reason for his/her
absence. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#83:1>
6.8. Students are not allowed to sit in a class unless they are
enrolled ( for credit or audit) in the said class, are taking the course
under the College of Liberal Arts free elective program, or are allowed by
the teacher to stay inside the classroom. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#84:1>
6.9. All honor students ( with a grade point average of 3.0 or
above in the preceding trimester) are given the privilege of unlimited cuts
or absences in academic subjects ( except P.E. for students with ID number 91
and below) but only upon presentation of a Certification for Unlimited Cuts
to the instructor concerned.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#85:1>
Such certification may be obtained from the Registrar 's Office. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#86:1>
6.9.1. Academic courses are those offered and taught by academic
departments and, as such, are under the supervision of an academic dean. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#87:1>
6.9.2. <mention> ORIENT </mention> , <mention> ROTC </mention> ,
and <mention> typing </mention> are non-academic courses.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#88:1>
<mention> P.E. </mention> is classified as a non-academic course for
students with ID number 91 and below. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#89:1>
6.10. Once a student accumulates half the number of absences
which render one ineligible for a passing grade, the instructor normally
warns the student concerned and informs the student 's academic dean, who, in
turn, summons the student and warns him.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#90:1>
A list of students who have acquired such absences is usually posted
on the administrative bulletin boards.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#91:1>
This warning, however, is not a prerequisite for dropping the student 's
course card once the number of maximum allowable absences is reached.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#92:1>
It is the student 's responsibility to keep a record of his/her
absences.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#93:1>
However, he/she may verify such from his/her instructor. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-005#94:1>
6.11. The dean of the college in which the student is enrolled
has the final power to adjudicate all problems arising due to absences from
regularly scheduled classes in the college. </p> </I>
