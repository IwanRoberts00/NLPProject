Dear Sir:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-024#7:1>
I am writing to express my intention to apply as a part-time
<bold> Language Instructor/Lecturer </bold> in your department.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-024#8:1>
As my <foreign> resume </foreign> outlines, I have had an extensive
experience in this function. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-024#9:1>
I believe that the experience I have acquired from varied academic
environments would be valuable to the department.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-024#10:1>
In addition, my exposure to this university, both as a student and as
a Language Instructor ( at CELL), serves as an advantage since I have already
imbibed the thrust of the school curriculum, that of communicative competence
among students.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-024#11:1>
My dedication, resilience, and innate love of teaching and of the
language prod me to pursue the pinnacle of my ambition - - - to join the
faculty of this prestigious university. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-024#12:1>
The enclosed <foreign> resume </foreign> gives specifics on
several of my accomplishments in this field.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-024#13:1>
I would certainly appreciate if you would grant me an opportunity to
discuss further my qualifications in person and to show my teaching skills.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-024#14:1>
I may be reached at the CELL office at 5219345, or at my residence
telephone number at 7835392, or at my mobile phone number, 09175286260,
anytime. </p>

Dear Dr. Dayag:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-024#44:3>
It has always been my dream to be a part of the De La Salle
University community.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-024#45:3>
I feel that my training in English language teaching and experience
in the field of theater arts qualify me for a part-time teaching position.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-024#46:3>
Please regard this letter as my formal application. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-024#47:3>

Laude </foreign> , with a degree of Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science
in Education, with English as my major.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-024#48:3>
In summer 2001, I obtained my Master of Arts in Theater Arts degree
from the University of the Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-024#49:3>
My MA degree has strengthened my background in using creative
dramatics in teaching writing and speaking.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-024#50:3>
I have eleven years of teaching language, literature, public
speaking, and drama courses in the tertiary level. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-024#51:3>
As a drama and speech teacher, I conduct speech choir, readers
theater, and chamber theater presentations.

programs and organize university-wide celebrations.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-024#54:3>
At present, I am one of the curriculum materials writers for the
special program for the arts ( theater arts) of the Department of Education.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-024#55:3>
My present position has been quite satisfactory but having
enrolled in the Ph.D. Applied Linguistics program in this university, I seek
the further challenges of teaching in your prestigious school. </p>

Dear Miss Villa:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-024#117:7>
This is to inform that I am presently under Dr. Romeo Lee 's
advisorship on thesis writing for my Masters Degree in Health Social Science.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-024#118:7>
And I am about to write the entire research proposal for
presentation.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-024#119:7>
During one of my consultations with him he informed me of the
on-going study being conducted by your office on adolescents aged 10-14 years
old.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-024#120:7>
It so happened that it 's one of my areas of interest.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-024#121:7>
He suggested that I better come up with a separate quantitative
paper making use of the raw data you are about to gather in full on the month
of September. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-024#122:7>
In view hereof, I would like to request your permission for me
to have a copy of the research instrument as well as learn about what exact
results you envision so I can avoid any particular duplication.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-024#123:7>
I will have to anchor my study 's features from the instrument used.
</p>

<p>
