Dear Laureen,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#8:1>
Your first letter arrived at home whilst I was still in Hongkong.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#9:1>
Yes, I 've tasted a persimmon.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#10:1>
I tasted it in London.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#11:1>
My host peeled one for me and it tasted like a very sweet <indig>
chico </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#12:1>
Yes, yes, yes. ...buy the computer!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#13:1>
Cristy says WAVE in Roponggi ( wrong spelling <indig> yata </indig> )
or HMV in Shinjuku may help you with Mishima.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#14:1>
If you can't find it, don't exert too much effort in looking.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#15:1>
Have fun! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#16:1>
The contract between Hongkong and England will expire on 01
January 1997.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#17:1>
Sorry... we will have to go in 1996 if we can.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#18:1>
My sister wants to go before they turn red.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#19:1>
But when I was there, I didn't enjoy it at all.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#20:1>
First and foremost, I was billeted at the new territories... some 20
km away from downtown.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#21:1>
Then, Hongkong was hot, polluted, dirty and crowded.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#22:1>
I had to walk on the street itself to get from one place to another.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#23:1>
People were bumping into me thrice every second.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#24:1>
I hated it.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#25:1>
According to some people, many are already going in 1997 to witness
the turnover.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#26:1>
Why they want to do that, I have no idea. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#27:1>
Anyway, if you can afford it, go to Europe!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#28:1>
The experience is worth too much compared to &yen;125,000.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#29:1>
Although, it might be cheaper to leave from here.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#30:1>
You might want to come home ( depending on how much it is to come
home) then leave for Geneva from Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#31:1>
I think that you can get a ticket for &dollar;1,000 two ways to
Europe.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#32:1>
Philippine Airlines <indig> lang nga </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#33:1>
Try to get a student fare from Japan if you can.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#34:1>
The U.S. is hot during July and August.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#35:1>
California may be more pleasant, though.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#36:1>
But SanFo might be hot.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#37:1>
So prepare. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#38:1>
Yes, it is alright to send &ldquo; the Dean &rdquo; a message
through e-mail.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#39:1>
DO IT!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#40:1>
DO IT!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#41:1>
DO IT!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#42:1>
Then, when he sends you e-mail messages print it out and keep it in
your wallet.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#43:1>
I can vouch for the fact that Jollibee is still orange.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#44:1>
And Ronald McDonald is still red. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#45:1>
Anyway, the ABS-CBN Christmas party was a blast.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#46:1>
Our department won first prize in the inter-department presentation.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#47:1>
We won PH&peso;15,000!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#48:1>
Also, many people in our department won in the raffle.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#49:1>
Ramil won a trip for two to Hongkong.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#50:1>
Patrick won a 21-inch TV.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#51:1>
Pat-P won PH&peso;50, 000.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#52:1>
And I was supposed to have won a mini-compo.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#53:1>
But I wasn't there to claim the prize so technically it has been
forfeited.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#54:1>
But my friends here are trying to get it for me.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#55:1>
So, I 'll update you on that. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#56:1>
Pat-P was saying <indig> kanina </indig> how much blessings she
received this year.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#57:1>
I, too, have counted my blessings.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#58:1>
The London trip being the biggest.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#59:1>
Next, my new car. .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#60:1>
Then my merit increase... so many. .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#61:1>
It 's true that you have to go into some sort of suffering for
purification before receiving blessings.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#62:1>
I guess it makes it more valuable than receiving them regularly.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#63:1>
Although I never discount the fact that I make it home everyday
unscathed.. .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#64:1>
Matthew takes care of me so well.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#65:1>
I light candles for him everytime I go to Mass.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#66:1>
Mass... that reminds me...

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#67:1>
I sang for the Immaculate Conception Mass last Friday ( day of the
ABS Christmas party)...

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#68:1>
The priest wanted the common <indig> Ama Namin </indig> to be sung...

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#69:1>
Midway through the Mass, I realized that I did not know anymore the
tune of the common <indig> Ama Namin </indig> . .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#70:1>
PANIC!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#71:1>
<indig> Naghatak pa ako ng tao para lang masundan ko ang tune.
</indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#72:1>
Strange. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#73:1>
Your letter miraculously arrived 5 days after you posted it.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#74:1>
I think <indig> narinig ka yata sa complaint mong two weeks siya
hanggang makarating sa akin. </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#75:1>
I was doubly surprised to know the sweater reached you only in two
days.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#76:1>
DON'T MACHINE WASH THE SWEATER.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#77:1>
Hand wash it.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#78:1>
I wanted to get you a brighter colored one but all the other colors
were so drab.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#79:1>
Also, I wanted to write you a note but I was so busy and tired that I
just stuffed it into the envelop and left it with the <foreign> concierge
</foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#80:1>
Anyway, enjoy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#81:1>
We 're looking for the <indig> kweba </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#82:1>
It 'll be ready when you arrive.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#83:1>
See you soon, if not later. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#84:1>
Love,

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#85:1>

2-3-1 Nishiwaseda

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#90:2>
Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#91:2>
Japan

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#92:2>
Dear Laureen,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#93:2>
It was nice hearing your voice again and talk to you without any
time pressure from an unsympathetic public telephone. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#94:2>
I 'm very happy at the opportunities that are opening for you
with this Japan thing.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#95:2>
Just like Joy, who 's had to work hard for all the things she has
now, you deserve everything you can get your hands on.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#96:2>
I 'm just worried about Fanny, though... she wants many things but
true to her form, she 's going about it in the wrong ways.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#97:2>
Even if you say <indig> na </indig> she should not &ldquo; consume
&rdquo; me, there will always be a well of affection- <foreign> cum
</foreign> - friendship that I will automatically draw from from time to
time.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#98:2>
But I can't help feeling angry and sad that someone whose <foreign>
facade </foreign> is strong can be very unreasonably weak with stuff that
need fortitude and strength. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#99:2>
As for the movies that you are offering to look for, <indig>
hindi ko pinapahanap ang mahahanap dito </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#100:2>
Remember that war movie I 've been looking for for the past 20
years?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#101:2>
Well, <indig> baka may makilala kang expert sa war movies at
ma-identify niya ang cine.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#102:2>
Yung malaking problema diyan ay hindi ko na nga alam kung ano ang
title, hindi ko pa kilala ang actor!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#103:2>
Ano ba 'yan?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#104:2>
Anyway, ma-swerte ka naman, heto ang story </indig> ...

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#105:2>
The main character ( let 's call him <mention> Joe </mention> ) is
established as a criminal and is in prison ( first scene).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#106:2>
He is scheduled to be executed by guillotine.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#107:2>
He is brought to the guillotine and he goes on an existential
tirade...

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#108:2>
<quote> &ldquo; People think that death comes when the blade hits
your neck.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#109:2>
They 're wrong... death begins when they cut the collar off your
shirt... when they lay you down on the plank... &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#110:2>
( It 's funny, after 20 years, I still remember the dialogue but not
the title nor actor).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#111:2>
Then, <indig> siguro, may lahing Filipino ang director, </indig> the
compound is victim to a direct hit of a bomb <indig> at si Joe lang ang
nabuhay </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#112:2>
Anyway, he escapes and joins some underground force ( most likely
French) and meets their &ldquo; head saboteur".

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#113:2>
He learns what the saboteur does and bonds with them.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#114:2>
While all this is going on, the Germans ( the enemy) threatens to
shoot 10 village men everyday until the saboteur surrenders himself.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#115:2>
<indig> Hindi naman maka-surrender ang saboteur kasi nag-iisa siyang
hope ng tao.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#116:2>
Madami nang nag-sacrifice na sila daw ang saboteur pero tinatanong
ng Germans kung papaano sila mag-sabotage, hindi nila masagot </indig> , so
the killings continue.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#117:2>
So, I just don't remember if the village people asked him to
surrender or he did it out of his own will but he surrenders.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#118:2>
So the German general was skeptical about Joe...

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#119:2>
<indig> Kasi marami na ngang nag-surrender pero fake.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#120:2>
So tinanong ng general si Joe kung papaano siya mag-sabotage.
</indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#121:2>
For a split second, Joe had a choice whether or not to really
surrender and tell the general what he knows. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#122:2>
Very Sartre-tric, <indig> 'di ba </indig> ?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#123:2>
Existential <foreign> angst </foreign> ...

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#124:2>
In the end, he matter-of-factly relates how the sabotages are done
and the last words of the movie <quote> &ldquo; General, we have found the
saboteur. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#125:2>
I find this movie a great teaching aid for our philosophy classes
<indig> 'di ba </indig> ?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#126:2>
To show what existential <foreign> angst </foreign> is really about.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#127:2>
How to distinguish between <foreign> angst </foreign> and <it>
existential </it> <foreign> angst </foreign> ... kids can't invoke
existential <foreign> angst </foreign> when they 're problematic with
personal problems... they invoke existential <foreign> angst </foreign> when
there is a choice whether to further the cause of oneself or one of
mankind... that 's where existential <foreign> angst </foreign> comes in.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#128:2>
I find this movie a perfect example <indig> kasi </indig> , he was a
convicted criminal... he escapes and is free... he was about to be
executed... he is released from this sentence. .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#129:2>
He runs away like a coward...

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#130:2>
But in the end he is a hero... wow... existential... </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#131:2>
So, itinerary suggested by MLZ:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#132:2>
Enter Europe via Rome - From Rome train to Florence - Train from
Florence to Venice - train from Venice to Milan - train from Milan to Geneva
- train from Geneva to Paris - train from Paris to Calais - Eurail from
Calais to London - Underground rail from London to Oxford and back - British
Rail from London to Edinburgh and back - Plane to Madrid - go around Spain by
train ( wherever the wind takes you) - Plane from Madrid to Athens - meet
Milette in Athens - Plane to Cairo </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#133:2>
Option one Cairo to Manila

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#134:2>
Option two Cairo to Bangkok - Bangkok to Hongkong - Hongkong to
Manila

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#135:2>
Sounds good, eh?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#136:2>
Ask Aeroflot to make you an itinerary and attach the costs so you
can decide how to go about your travels.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#137:2>
Ask them to make arrangements for Eurail also.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#138:2>
Choose the cheapest route.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#139:2>
<indig> Huwag kang pa-balik-balik na route. </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#140:2>
Try as much as possible to travel in a straight line. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#141:2>
I 'm asking my friend in London to take you in as part-time
border.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#142:2>
Will advise you about this.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#143:2>
Shows to watch in London: 1. Sunset Boulevard - see if Elaine Paige
is doing the show; 2. Miss Saigon; 3. An Inspector Calls ( if still on); 4.
Cats; 5. Phantom of the Opera - see if Simon Bowman is doing the show; 6.
Five Guys Named Moe; 7. At least one Shakespearean play; 8. Ask around for
others, Oliver - Lea 's doing one of the lead roles. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#144:2>
The best way to maximize your time watching shows is to
itinerize it.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#145:2>
<indig> Iba-iba ang matinee show days ng mga plays. </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#146:2>
So you can watch two shows per day.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#147:2>
As far as I know when I was there, Matinees are as follows: 1. Miss
Saigon - Wednesday; 2. Sunset Boulevard - Thursday; 3. Cats - Saturday; 4.
Phantom - Wednesday; 5. Blood Brothers - Thursday. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#148:2>
All shows have evening performances everyday except Sunday.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#149:2>
You can, for example, watch <mention> Miss Saigon </mention>
Wednesday afternoon then watch <mention> Phantom </mention> that same night.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#150:2>
Get a map and chart the theaters, which are close to each other.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#151:2>
You can just walk from one theater to another.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#152:2>
When you get to London, the first thing you do is make the rounds of
all the theaters and buy the tickets.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#153:2>
You can sight-see in the morning.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#154:2>
<indig> Tuhugin mo ang </indig> Parliament plus Big Ben, Westminster
Abbey, Tower of London - Tower Bridge, then take a cab to Buckingham Palace.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#155:2>
Then when you go to see the shows, walk around before each show
around Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly Circus, Oxford Circus and Leicester (
pronounced Lester) Square.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#156:2>
Then Hyde Park and Pall Mall.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#157:2>
One day <indig> balikan </indig> to and from Edinburgh.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#158:2>
Finished! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#159:2>
<indig> Paris kaya ng four days.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#160:2>
Intense lang nga ang sight-seeing. </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#161:2>
Rome, at least 5 days.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#162:2>
<indig> Venice kaya ng overnight. </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#163:2>
<indig> Florence kaya ng overnight. </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#164:2>
Very intense <indig> lang talaga ang sight-seeing </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#165:2>
<indig> Parang hindi ka lang matutulog ng mahaba. </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#166:2>
Athens allot 3 days.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#167:2>
Cairo another three days.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#168:2>
If it is cheap enough allot 3 days each for Bangkok and Hongkong.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#169:2>
This plan should give you an idea as to how long your &ldquo;
vacation &rdquo; will take.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#170:2>
Itinerize and advise initial plans <indig> para maka-pag-plano din
ako </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#171:2>
This year would be the best time to go to Hongkong as well.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#172:2>
In 1997, there will be a lot of people who will go to HK to witness
the turn-over.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#173:2>
I don't think we 'd want to be there at that time.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#174:2>
Besides, HK is now too congested with people, too polluted and dirty
and damn hell expensive!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#175:2>
Since two years ago, you don't go to HK to shop anymore.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#176:2>
<indig> Ang mahal mahal na. </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#177:2>
It 's not fun to shop there anymore.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#178:2>
What 's worse, you can find everything in HK here in Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#179:2>
<indig> Parang wala ng </indig> premium and motivation to go to
Hongkong <indig> na </indig> , except of course, to eat. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#180:2>
We will be transferring to the big building this week.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#181:2>
Most likely, I 'll have e-mail there already.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#182:2>
We can communicate everyday <indig> na </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#183:2>
Exciting!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#184:2>
<indig> Pati Internet mayroon din... </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#185:2>
Wow, awesome...

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#186:2>
Cool. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#187:2>
See you soon. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#188:2>
Love,

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#189:2>
Milette

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#190:2>
P.S. <indig> Ok na ang London mo! </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#191:2>
<indig> Nag-ok na ang friend ko </indig> for your board & lodging.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#192:2>
<indig> Tuloy na! </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#193:2>
I may meet you there & we 'll go down to Athens together.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-005#194:2>
<indig> O, di ba? </indig> </p> </I>
