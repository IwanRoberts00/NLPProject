<h> <bold> Brotherhood gone wrong </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#2:1>
Fraternities are organizations that were formed to foster
comradeship among civilized individuals from diverse cultures. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#3:1>
Yet recent tragic events saw parents lose their sons over
senseless loyalties and abusive initiation rites. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#4:1>
The fraternity war at the University of the Philippines in Diliman
last February claimed another boy 's life - that of <foreign> Alpha Phi Beta
</foreign> member Den Daniel Reyes from the rival camp of <foreign> Sigma Rho
</foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#5:1>
Sometime ago, some members of Ateneo 's <foreign> Aquila Legis
</foreign> were convicted by the Caloocan Regional Trial Court of having
participated in initiation rites that led to the death of Lenny Villa.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#6:1>
Their appeal is still pending before a higher court. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#7:1>
Even at the country 's premier military school, the Philippine
Military Academy, there has been two reported hazing deaths. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#8:1>
Three cases of maltreatment were also exposed last year.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#9:1>
One of the victims during that bizarre hazing - electrocuting the
plebes - is now in a comatose state. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#10:1>
A fraternity is supposed to instill in the minds of its members
the group 's ideals and philosophy which should help frat men become better
citizens who respect the rights and individualities of others and appreciate
their self worth. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#11:1>
Something, however, is definitely wrong with the system.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#12:1>
Brazen acts of violence are alarmingly on the rise.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#13:1>
What is more chilling is the upswing of mob mentality among college
and high school students. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#14:1>
What triggers beastly behaviors among frat men when they
initially join the group to become part of an extended family?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#15:1>
What makes fraternities appealing to young students? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#16:1>
The young people join fraternities for worthwhile causes, the
need to belong, to uphold a tradition set by parents and even secure contacts
for future career moves. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#17:1>
Students who sign up without asking questions or pondering the
consequences of joining fraternities should also be answerable for the
actions they take. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#18:1>
Parents who push their children to follow their footsteps without
considering their children 's needs should be made accountable for any
tragedy that befalls the family. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#19:1>
People in government may also be held culpable for conveying a
certain sense of materialism.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#20:1>
They are too preoccupied in associating with influential persons who
can later be considered assets since appointments in certain offices depend
on not what you know but who you know. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#21:1>
Being a member of the same fraternity appears to bear more weight
on the outcome of hiring or firing decisions.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#22:1>
This appears to penetrate into the consciousness of the youth. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#23:1>
More often than not, senior frat men are the perpetrators of the
mess in which the group finds itself.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#24:1>
Being the elders in their organization, it is presumed they take it
upon themselves to ensure no harm comes to their members and to keep their
organization 's reputation intact.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#25:1>
Sadly, this is often not the case, for they, the leaders, usually
initiate the abuses. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#26:1>
There is also the possibility that fraternity leaders themselves
could have been the victims of abuse as well during their own initiation
rites.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#27:1>
These senior frat men might have never fully recovered from the
physical pain and emotional torture they also had to endure.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#28:1>
The need to extract their revenge on the fledgling members could have
been subconsciously nurtured through the years of silent suffering. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#29:1>
When things go wrong, ambitions of parents, peer pressure, school
officials ' indifference, power tripping of fraternity leaders and the kids '
lack of initiative to question the pros and cons of their actions, are
blamed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#30:1>
A lot of questions may be left unanswered on the merits or
demerits of joining a fraternity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#31:1>
War-freak individuals, although a minority, do more harm to the
image of the true meaning of brotherhood, specially when this free-for-all
causes the death or injury of a member. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#32:1>
Is it worth joining a fraternity? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#33:1>
There is no clear-cut answer to this dilemma.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#34:1>
An individual is responsible for the actions he takes.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#35:1>
His need for joining a fraternity would depend on his convictions,
needs and level of maturity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#36:1>
Fraternities are probably here to stay.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#37:1>
But hazing need not continue to exist.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#38:1>
Our young leaders can make that choice and make the difference. </p>

<h> <bold> The people 's will </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#40:2>
A little over a decade ago, Filipinos were one in their fight to
replace the dictatorship and restore democracy in their country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#41:2>
They fought for, and won, democracy by staging an uprising in
Edsa in 1986. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#42:2>
Today we, the Filipino people, are enjoying the blessings of
democracy.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#43:2>
Today we are a people who can freely elect our political leaders.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#44:2>
Yet those at Edsa who claimed then that they were fighting for
democracy are now crying for the ouster of a President who was elected in
1998 in a clean and orderly election. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#45:2>
A group, reportedly composed of former political activists, media
personalities, Makati-based businessmen and veterans of the Edsa revolt, with
its spokesman Jose Luis Alcuaz, is mounting a &ldquo; silent protest &rdquo;
against Mr. Estrada whom the group wants replaced, the <mention> <it>
Philippine Daily Inquirer </it> </mention> bannered yesterday. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#46:2>
Alcuaz hardly enjoys any social and political credibility.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#47:2>
He has been dismissed many times over in the past as a crackpot.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#48:2>
Why the <mention> <it> Inquirer </it> </mention> chose to banner a
story based on Alcuaz 's statements is baffling unless the paper has decided
to come out openly as the Estrada opposition press. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#49:2>
It appears that it is not democracy the group wants restored but
a return to dictatorship; one where a small group imposes its will and
dictates to the nation who it believes fit to lead the country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#50:2>
Like Mr. Estrada or not, he was the democratic choice of the
Filipino people in 1998.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#51:2>
The people gave him a six-year mandate without any conditions
attached, save for his being subject to impeachment for willful violation of
the Constitution. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#52:2>
Under constitutional rules, which the same &ldquo; yellow &rdquo;
<&> yellow=color of protest </&> group designed, the President cannot be
removed from office except by impeachment or when the President is
permanently disabled.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#53:2>
The President has the option to resign, but the decision to step down
before his term is up is up to him - not any group 's decision. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#54:2>
The Alcuaz group says it wants Mr. Estrada replaced, by whom, the
group does not say.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#55:2>
How it wants him replaced wasn't mentioned either.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#56:2>
But as the so-called campaign has the Edsa flavor, it appears that
the group 's way is the extra-constitutional way. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#57:2>
Under a dictatorial reign, this is perhaps understandable and
even admissible, but it is ridiculous for the group to take the extra-legal
route under a democratic setup. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#58:2>
Does the group seek to replace Mr. Estrada through snap
presidential elections?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#59:2>
But this route is an impossibility under the Constitution since the
Charter mechanism for presidential succession is clear. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#60:2>
Only when both the vice president and the president resign
simultaneously can an election be called by Congress within 45-60 days to
elect two new leaders of the nation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#61:2>
Within that period of time, an adventurous military can take over
the reins of government, given a vacuum in congressional leadership. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#62:2>
And then, we are back to a military regime and a dictatorship.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#63:2>
Alcuaz says the group is done with Mr. Estrada.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#64:2>
Enough of Estrada.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#65:2>
No more.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#66:2>
Replace him.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#67:2>
Estrada is floundering.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#68:2>
Stop cronyism, corruption and nepotism, the group 's &ldquo; silent
protest &rdquo; says. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#69:2>
Notice that the group does not call for the resignation of Mr.
Estrada, but a replacement. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#70:2>
What system then does the group want to establish when it, under
a democracy, calls for Mr. Estrada to be replaced? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#71:2>
The replacement of a democratic system and the establishment of a
political system where a minority decides how long a President should stay in
office? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#72:2>
The group 's true colors are showing.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#73:2>
Democracy was never its goal.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#74:2>
A dictatorship, where the group 's members will regain position and
power, is. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#75:2>
The Filipino people voted for Mr. Estrada to be the Philippine
president for six years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#76:2>
The people 's will should never be thwarted. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#77:2>
That was what Edsa should have taught this group. </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#78:3>
<h> <bold> Buying Power </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#79:3>
It does not shock the nation that congressmen were recipients of
at least half a million pesos each in bribe and hush money for the passage of
the Omnibus Power Bill. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#80:3>
It is hardly a state secret that our congressmen can be bribed,
even when the price is not quite right. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#81:3>
Our congressmen hardly have a sterling reputation when it comes
to selling out national interests in exchange for personal and vested
interests. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#82:3>
It is also not the first time our congressmen have been caught
with their hands in the cookie lobby jar.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#83:3>
Not too long ago, in another Congress, largely made up of the same
members, it was discovered that money made the rounds to get another bill
passed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#84:3>
What disturbs, however, is that many of the whistle blowers of
bribe practices in Congress invariably blurt this information to the media
only after the fact. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#85:3>
In Congress, as the Constitution states, three readings of any
bill are required before its passage into law, whether this is performed in
the House or in the Senate. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#86:3>
On third and final reading, no amendment is allowed and a vote is
immediately taken, with the <foreign> yeas </foreign> and <foreign> nays
</foreign> entered in the journal. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#87:3>
Stated differently, the third reading of any bill is a formality
once a bill passes second reading. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#88:3>
Congressmen, including the whistle blowers, are certainly aware
of this constitutional requisite and they must have already been alerted to
the fact that whatever provisions were included in the Omnibus Power Bill on
second reading would be no different when the third reading comes about. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#89:3>
So the money came after the passage of the bill and party list
candidates such as Representatives Renato Magtubo and Loretta Anne Rosales
revealed to the media that legislators were bribed into passing the power
bill.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#90:3>
They had the money as evidence, to the photographers ' delight. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#91:3>
That money made the rounds in Congress is undeniable. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#92:3>
But what disturbs again, is the spin some of the whistle blowers
placed on the story. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#93:3>
Rosales and Magtubo admitted that as early as last week, word
about the bribe money had started to circulate a week before the House
approved the bill. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#94:3>
Why then did not Rosales and Magtubo denounce this in a privilege
speech, if only to derail the passage of the power bill?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#95:3>
Media would certainly have given it a big play, enough for the power
bill 's passage to be killed or, at the very least, delayed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#96:3>
Rosales, who voted against the bill, also claimed that those who
voted for the bill 's passage probably got more than half a million.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#97:3>
She also claimed that while the money was being distributed in
Minority Leader Felicisimo Belmonte 's office, she nevertheless believes the
money came from House Speaker Manuel Villar. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#98:3>
Yet what evidence does Rosales have to prove her allegations that
the money came from Villar, specially when she herself admitted that she was
handed an envelope containing the money in the office of Belmonte. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#99:3>
This is not to say that the money could not have come from
Villar.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#100:3>
But without any evidence to support her allegations, it is highly
irresponsible for Rosales to make such a claim, specially as the envelopes
were being distributed in the office of Belmonte. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#101:3>
Why then make such a claim without first producing the evidence
to support it?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#102:3>
Why did Rosales immediately clear Belmonte of such charges as though
Belmonte did not know what was going on in his office and did not know as
well that his office, the distribution center, was awash with millions in
bribe money for House members? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#103:3>
It is good that these members of the House exposed the bribery,
but it would have been better if they, for reasons of their own, proved
themselves to be more responsible lawmakers by first, blowing the whistle
when word on the bribery practice went around before the second reading and
second, after getting the evidence that was the bribe money, they had
presented the facts to the media without putting their own political spin to
it. </p> </I>


<I>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#104:4>
<h> <bold> Let the heavens fall </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#105:4>
Congress has no choice but to insist on a full-scale
investigation to be conducted by an independent probe body on the payola
scandal attached to the third reading passage of the Omnibus Power Bill. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#106:4>
For Congress to do less will merely cause a disastrous erosion
of the public 's trust and confidence in yet another government institution.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#107:4>
If the country and its democratic system of governance are to
survive, Congress, the makers of the laws of the land, the representatives of
the people and the purse giver must undergo a public cleansing through a
thorough and impartial investigation.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#108:4>
And let the chips fall where they may. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#109:4>
In the course of a probe, it may be discovered that indeed, the
interested buyers of the National Power Corp. tempted legislators and their
other friends in government with filthy lucre.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#110:4>
Reputations may be ruined, businesses may fold and political careers
may be destroyed, but the Congress, the nation and the democratic ways for
which the Filipinos fought fiercely in 1986, will emerge the stronger for it.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-009#111:4>
And it will have become a painful lesson learned by the present
and future members of Congress - one mistake they may no longer want to
repeat when they remember the shame and the loss of respect of their
constituents for such acts unbecoming of a legislator and a public servant.
</p> ... </I>
