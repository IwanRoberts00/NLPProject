<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#3:1>
<h> <bold> What is the retirement benefit? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#4:1>
It is a cash benefit paid to a member who can no longer work due
to old age. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#5:1>
<h> <bold> Who may qualify for a retirement benefit? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#6:1>
1. A member who is 60 years old and unemployed and has paid at
least 120 monthly contributions prior to the semester of retirement. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#7:1>
2. A member who is 65 years old, whether employed or not.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#8:1>
If employed he should have paid 120 monthly contributions prior to the
semester of retirement, whether employed or not. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#9:1>
<h> <bold> What are the types of retirement benefits? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#10:1>
They are:

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#11:1>
1. the monthly pension, and

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#12:1>
2. the lump sum amount. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#13:1>
The monthly pension is a lifetime cash benefit paid to a retiree
who has paid at least 120 monthly contributions to the SSS prior to the
semester of retirement. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#14:1>
The lump sum amount is granted to a retiree who has not paid the
required 120 monthly contributions. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#15:1>
<h> <bold> How much monthly pension will a retiree receive? </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#16:1>
The monthly pension will be the highest of:

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#17:1>
1. the sum of &peso;300 plus 20 per cent of the average monthly
salary credit plus two per cent of the average monthly salary credit for each
credited year of service in excess of 10 years; or

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#18:1>
2. 40 per cent of the average monthly salary credit; or

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#19:1>
3. &peso;1,200, provided, that the monthly pension is paid for not
less than 60 months. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#20:1>
The lowest monthly pension is &peso;1,200 if the member has 120
monthly contributions; &peso;2,400 if he has at least 20 credited years of
service. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#21:1>
A retiree has the option to receive his first 18 monthly pensions
in lump sum discounted at a preferential rate of interest to be determined by
the SSS.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#22:1>
The option should be exercised upon filing of the first retirement
claim.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#23:1>
Only advance payments shall be discounted on the date of payment.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#24:1>
The dependents ' and 13th month pensions are excluded from the
18-months lump sum pension. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#25:1>
Should there be an increase in the monthly pension within the
18-month period, the discounted interest rate will be applied. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#26:1>
The member will receive his monthly pension on the 19th month.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#27:1>
The advanced amount will be deducted from future pensions. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#28:1>
<h> <bold> What happens when the retirement pensioner resumes
employment? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#29:1>
The monthly pension of a retirement pensioner who resumes
employment and is less than 65 years old will be suspended.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#30:1>
He and his employer will again be subject to compulsory coverage.
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#31:1>
<h> <bold> How much is the monthly pension of a member who retires
after age 60 with 120 monthly contributions? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#32:1>
The monthly pension of a member who retires after age 60 and has
paid the required 120 monthly contributions, will be the higher of either:

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#33:1>
1. the monthly pension computed at the earliest time he could have
retired had he been separated from employment plus all adjustments;

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#34:1>
2. the monthly pension computed at the time when he actually retires.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#35:1>
A member who retires more than once shall be entitled to the
higher of:

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#36:1>
1. the monthly pension computed for the first retirement claim; or

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#37:1>
2. the recomputed monthly pension for the new claim. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#38:1>
<h> <bold> How is the monthly pension paid? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#39:1>
The monthly pension is paid through the member 's designated
bank. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#40:1>
A member who becomes a pensioner starting Sept. 1, 1993 is
allowed to choose the bank nearest his residence through which he wishes to
receive his pension benefits under the <indig> &ldquo; Mag-Impok sa Bangko
&rdquo; </indig> Program. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#41:1>
A benefit claimant who has a single savings account that he wants
the SSS to use for payment of his pension should submit his savings account
number and a photocopy of the passbook 's first and second pages to the SSS
upon filing of application for retirement claim.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#42:1>
He should also show the original passbook during the filing of his
application for authentication. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#43:1>
Upon approval of the claim, the SSS will mail a notice-voucher to
the claimant informing him when he can withdraw his benefit from the bank.
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#44:1>
<h> <bold> Can a member receive his retirement claim on the actual
date of retirement? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#45:1>
Yes.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#46:1>
The retirement benefit will be paid to the qualified member on the
actual date of technical retirement provided that he submits the necessary
documents six months before the actual date of retirement. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#47:1>
<h> <bold> How much is the lump sum amount? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#48:1>
The lump sum amount is equivalent to the total contributions paid
by the member and his employer, plus interest. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#49:1>
<h> <bold> Aside from the retirement benefit, what else can a retiree
receive? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#50:1>
The retiree is entitled to a 13th month pension payable every
December. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#51:1>
He and his dependents are also entitled to Medicare benefits
under the administration of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (
PhilHealth). </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#52:1>
<h> <bold> Are the children of a retiree member entitled to the
dependent 's pension? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#53:1>
The dependent legitimate, legitimated, legally adopted and
illegitimate children, conceived on or before the date of contingency, will
each receive the dependent 's pension equivalent to 10 per cent of the member 's
monthly pension or &peso;250, whichever is higher. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#54:1>
Only five minor children, beginning from the youngest, are
entitled to the dependents ' pension.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#55:1>
No substitution is allowed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#56:1>
Where there are more than five legitimate and illegitimate
children, the legitimate ones will be preferred. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#57:1>
<h> <bold> For how long will the dependent child receive his pension?
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#58:1>
The dependent 's pension stops when the child reaches 21 years
old, gets married, gets employed and earns &peso;300 a month or more, or
dies.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#59:1>
However, the dependent 's pension is granted for life to children who
are over 21 years old, provided they are incapacitated and incapable of
self-support due to physical or mental defect which is congenital or acquired
during minority. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#60:1>
<h> <bold> What will happen to the monthly pension of a retiree in
case of death? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#61:1>
Upon the death of a retiree-pensioner, his primary beneficiaries
will get 100 per cent of his monthly pension plus the dependents ' pension
for each child.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#62:1>


<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#63:1>
If he dies within 60 months from the start of his pension and he
has no primary beneficiaries, his secondary beneficiaries will receive a lump
sum benefit equivalent to the difference of 60 times the monthly pension and
the total monthly pensions paid by the SSS excluding the dependent 's
pension. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#64:1>
<h> <bold> What papers are needed in filing for retirement benefit?

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#73:1>
Application forms for retirement benefit are filed at any SSS
branch or representative office. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#74:1>
<h> <bold> Sickness Benefit </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#75:1>
<h> <bold> What is the sickness benefit? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#76:1>
The sickness benefit is a daily cash allowance paid for the
number of days a member is unable to work due to sickness or injury. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#77:1>
<h> <bold> How does an SSS member qualify for the sickness benefit?
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#78:1>
A member is qualified to avail himself of this benefit if:

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#79:1>
1. he is unable to work due to sickness or injury and is thus
confined either in the hospital or at home for at least four days;

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#80:1>
2. he has paid at least three monthly contributions within the
12-month period immediately before the semester of sickness;

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#81:1>
3. he has used up all current company sick leaves with pay for the
current year; and

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#82:1>
4. he has notified his employer or the SSS, if he is a separated,
voluntary or self-employed member. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#83:1>
<h> <bold> How much sickness benefit is an employee entitled to
receive? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#84:1>
The amount of an employee 's sickness benefit is computed as: the
daily sickness allowance times the approved number of days. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#85:1>
Effective May 24, 1997, the daily sickness allowance is 90 per
cent of the average daily salary credit ( <it> Section 14 of Republic Act
8282 </it> ) . </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#86:1>
<h> <bold> How is the sickness benefit computed? </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#87:1>
1. Exclude the semester of sickness.

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#88:1>
A <it> semester </it> refers to two consecutive quarters ending
in the quarter of sickness.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#89:1>
A <it> quarter </it> refers to three consecutive months ending on the
last day of March, June, September or December. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#90:1>
2. Count 12 months backwards starting from the month immediately
before the semester of sickness.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#91:1>
3. Identify the six highest monthly salary credits within the
12-month period.

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#92:1>
<it> Monthly salary credit </it> means the compensation base for
contributions and benefits related to the total earnings for the month.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#93:1>
( The maximum covered earnings or compensation increases by
&peso;1,000 beginning at &peso;7,000 in 1994 and every January of each year
thereafter until the maximum of &peso;12,000 is reached.) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#94:1>
Please refer to the following table: <O> ( table) </O> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#95:1>
4. Add the six highest monthly salary credits to get the total
monthly salary credit.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#96:1>
5. Divide the total monthly salary credit by 180 days to get the
average daily salary credit.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#97:1>
6. Multiply the average daily salary credit by 90 per cent to get the
daily sickness allowance.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#98:1>
7. Multiply the daily sickness allowance by the approved number of
days to arrive at the amount of benefit due.

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#99:1>
<bold> For example </bold> , let us say that an SSS member falls
sick or gets injured in October 1998 for 20 days:

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#100:1>
a. The semester of sickness would be from July 1998 to December
1998.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#101:1>
b. The 12-month period would be from July 1997 to June 1998 within
which the six highest monthly salary credits will be chosen.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#102:1>
c. Let us assume that the six highest monthly salary credits are
&peso;11,000 each.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#103:1>
Thus, the total monthly salary credit is &peso;66,000 ( &peso;11,000
x 6).

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#104:1>
d. The total monthly salary credit would be divided by 180 to get
the average daily salary credit or &peso;366.67 ( &peso;66,000/180).

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#105:1>
e. The daily sickness allowance is 90 per cent of the average daily
salary credit or &peso;330 ( &peso;366.67 x 0.9).

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#106:1>
Thus, the daily sickness allowance for 1998 is &peso;330.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#107:1>
This amount was derived by determining the daily salary credit as
follows: &peso;11,000 ( maximum salary credit) x 6/180 = 366.67.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#108:1>
Ninety per cent of &peso;366.67 is &peso;330.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#109:1>
f. The total sickness benefit is &peso;6,600 ( 330 x 20 days). </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#110:1>
<h> <bold> How many days in a year can a member avail himself of the
sickness benefit? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#111:1>
A member can be granted sickness benefit for a maximum of 120
days in one calendar year.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#112:1>
Any unused portion of the allowable 120 days sickness benefit cannot
be carried forward and added to the total number of allowable compensable
days in the subsequent year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#113:1>
The sickness benefit shall not be paid for more than 240 days on
account of the same illness.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#114:1>
If the sickness or injury still persists after 240 days, the claim
will be considered a disability claim. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#115:1>
<h> <bold> Who should an employee notify regarding his sickness or
injury? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#116:1>
A member should notify his employer within five calendar days
after the start of the sickness or injury.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#117:1>
The employer, in turn, has another five calendar days to notify the
SSS.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#118:1>
Notification to the employer is not necessary if an employed member 's
confinement is in a hospital or if he fell sick or was injured while working
or was within the company premises.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#119:1>
In this case, the employer has to notify the SSS within five days of
the employee 's sickness or injury.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#120:1>
This is the rule on notification. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#121:1>
<h> <bold> What is the procedure for notification for unemployed,
self-employed and voluntary members? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#122:1>
If a member is unemployed, a self-employed person or voluntarily
paying, he should directly notify the SSS within five calendar days after the
start of confinement, unless such confinement is in a hospital in which case,
notification is not necessary. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#123:1>
<h> <bold> What are the effects of failure or delay in notification?
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#124:1>
1. If the employee notifies his employer, or the SSS, in the
case of an unemployed member, self-employed or voluntarily paying member,
beyond the prescribed five-day period, the confinement shall be deemed to
have started not earlier than the fifth day immediately preceding the date of
notification. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#125:1>
2. If the employer notifies the SSS beyond the five calendar
days after receipt of the notification from the employee, the employer shall
be reimbursed only for each day of confinement from the 10th calendar day
immediately preceding the date of notification to the SSS. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-004#126:1>
If the employee has given the required notification to his
employer, but the employer fails to notify the SSS within the prescribed
period resulting in the reduction or denial by the SSS of the claim, the
employer shall have no right to recover the daily sickness allowance he paid
to his employee. </p> </I>
