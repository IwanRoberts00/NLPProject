<I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#1:1:A>
<O> music </O> We hope we did not scare you when I said <indig> ipapatawas namin kayo </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#2:1:A>
But today <,> uh we will show you the many other uses of <indig> tawas </indig> and uh from the market it is now available in every major department stores and supermarkets all over the country
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#3:1:A>
And of course today Dr Sonny Acha will talk to us about the many uses of <indig> tawas </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#4:1:B>
Well to start with uh <,> <indig> tawas </indig> as it <.> i </.> as we call it in the local medium Filipino is in English uh <mention> alum </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#5:1:B>
Now the chemical name <,> we have several <.> varie </.> <.> vari </.> variations like <.> alum </.> uh potassium aluminum sulfate uh which is this crystal group
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#6:1:B>
Now as far as the uses we can trace as far as history from the old folks that they 've been using it for simple treatment like uh for ailments like mouth sores or <indig> singaw </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#7:1:B>
So from there you can see that it has the medicinal sort of medicinal uses which we have adopted into these cosmetic lines <O> music </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#8:1:A>
I see and uh what is the ingredient in <indig> tawas </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#9:1:A>
For example I know that you have gone into the deodorant line

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#10:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#11:1:A>
Which is actually a more sophisticated way of just <indig> pukpuk pukpuk </indig> you know

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#12:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#13:1:A>
You pulverize it and people use it and it gets messy you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#14:1:A>
And now you 're using <indig> tawas </indig> with <indig> calamansi </indig> and <indig> tawas </indig> pure alum

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#15:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#16:1:A>
Now uhm what 's the difference of uh the <indig> tawas </indig> with <indig> calamansi </indig> and pure alum

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#17:1:B>
Now with regards the differences in the deodorants we <.> ha </.> we came out with two varieties now one with the pure <indig> tawas </indig> uh alum and one with the <indig> calamansi </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#18:1:B>
Now we added the <indig> calamansi </indig> extract
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#19:1:B>
This is uh intended for people who perspire heavily especially the overweight
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#20:1:B>
So we thought of just not using plain <indig> tawas </indig> but plus another additive which could help prevent heavy perspiration especially the odor emitted after perspiring

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#21:1:A>
Uh-huh
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#22:1:A>
And uh I understand that these uh two uh products are now available in roll-on <{> <[> and uh </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#23:1:B>
<[> And spray </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#24:1:A>
And uh spray

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#25:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#26:1:A>
Alright
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#27:1:A>
Now uh how about the other uh lines that you are doing

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#28:1:B>
One popular line right now that we have is the astringent group
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#29:1:B>
Now it comes in four different types
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#30:1:B>
We have one for normal skin one for oily skin this is the <indig> tawas </indig> with uh pineapple extract and then one for skin discolorations like <indig> an-an </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#31:1:B>
We added the radish extract
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#32:1:B>
And then lastly we have the <indig> tawas </indig> with avocado cucumber and <foreign> aloe vera </foreign> extract
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#33:1:B>
This is uh intended for dry skin
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#34:1:B>
Now what makes our astringent different from the usual astringents that you see in the market is that we have instead of the usual boric acid uh content we added the <indig> tawas </indig> crystals
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#35:1:B>
So this is pure and natural crystals without any chemical uh additives

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#36:1:A>
Okay I 'd like to go back you know one by one because sometimes uh we we see all these labels of products and you really don't know why this is so and why you should buy for example uh an astringent with pineapple
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#37:1:A>
Now tell us one by one exactly what is the importance of choosing one from from the other

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#38:1:B>
Yeah
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#39:1:B>
So let 's start with the <indig> tawas </indig> facial lotion with pineapple extract
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#40:1:B>
That says here this is uh intended for oily skin 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#41:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#42:1:B>
Because you have the pineapple which is uh which whose basic ingredient is vitamin C
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#43:1:B>
Now that helps dissolve the oils from the skin especially in the face

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#44:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#45:1:B>
So and then the next one is the <indig> tawas </indig> facial lotion with the radish extract

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#46:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#47:1:B>
This is the first actually the first of its kind if not here in the country

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#48:1:A>
<{> <[> But in the world yes </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#49:1:B>
<[> World yes </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#50:1:B>
Yes because we we were the first to put the radish extract

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#51:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#52:1:B>
Now radish has the ingredient of sulfur and potassium which helps uh stabilize skin discolorations

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#53:1:A>
<{> <[> I see </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#54:1:B>
<[> In short </[> </{> if you have whitish spots it helps bring back the normal color of the skin

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#55:1:A>
Uh you were mentioning uh a while ago about <indig> an-an </indig> you know

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#56:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#57:1:A>
And that 's something that normally you always hear people saying oh I have <indig> an-an 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#58:1:A>
In effect uh that 's not a skin disease that external skin disease it 's really uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#59:1:B>
It 's a vitamin <{> <[> deficiency </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#60:1:A>
<[> Deficiency </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#61:1:B>
Of the skin

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#62:1:A>
I see

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#63:1:B>
And then the supplement you can get from the radish extract

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#64:1:A>
But but don't we hear people say <indig> na nakakahawa 'yang an-an </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#65:1:B>
Yes it 's a very common skin disease and it 's very readily communicable <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#66:1:B>
<{> <[> You </[> get in contact with people with this uh skin disease and you get it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#67:1:A>
<[> But </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#68:1:B>
You get the same skin problem

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#69:1:A>
Even if the other person is not uh who gets it and somebody else who has uh uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#70:1:B>
<indig> An-an </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#71:1:A>
A low of potassium uh thing or just anybody gets it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#72:1:B>
You can have many causes one as I mentioned is vitamin deficiency plus it 's a communicable skin disease

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#73:1:A>
So it 's a skin disease really

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#74:1:B>
Now if you have a potentially you you are already deficient in vitamins <,> involved with that problem you get it readily

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#75:1:A>
I see okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#76:1:A>
And radish when you eat radish it increases your potassium and your sulfur

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#77:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#78:1:A>
Uh-huh okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#79:1:A>
Now you just mentioned about sulfur and uh and uh potassium
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#80:1:A>
Like for example we 're having Mount Pinatubo now erupting and people are talking about skin diseases and what can happen you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#81:1:A>
I mean is this uh uhm astringent uh going to be very helpful to people that suffer from this type of uh problem

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#82:1:B>
Yes one potential danger if you have fall-outs from the volcanic eruption is you get a very irritating skin disease wherein you have <.> li </.> a freckle-like uh spots
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#83:1:B>
Now this is timely the radish extract uh facial lotion could help cure <,> this this said disease

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#84:1:A>
This said disease

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#85:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#86:1:A>
Okay let 's go to the next one

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#87:1:B>
Now the next is the triple combination of uh avocado cucumber and <foreign> aloe vera </foreign> extract

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#88:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#89:1:B>
Which we added with the <indig> tawas </indig> facial lotion
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#90:1:B>
Now this we intended for dry skin because uh especially <foreign> aloe vera </foreign> it 's a very popular herbal extract which is popularly known for moisturizing the skin

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#91:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#92:1:B>
Together with avocado and cucumber that helps uh even out even small freckles or wrinkles in skin

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#93:1:A>
In the skin

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#94:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#95:1:A>
Even freckles can be taken out

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#96:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#97:1:A>
Wow
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#98:1:A>
I 'm sure that will be uh very much uh appreciated by <O> chuckle </O> especially the over forty <O> chuckle </O> people <O> chuckle </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#99:1:B>
And then lastly we have the uh <indig> tawas </indig> facial lotion which is uh for general use
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#100:1:B>
We recommended this for all types of skin

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#101:1:A>
Uh-huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#102:1:B>
So for daily use maintenance in just cleaning the face the <indig> tawas </indig> facial lotion clear <,> which has no color

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#103:1:A>
I see 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#104:1:A>
Now you I know we 're discussing about <indig> tawas </indig> and you 're talking about astringents <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#105:1:A>
Uh there is this uh uh notion that uh any kind of tea can also be very good you know for skin
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#106:1:A>
Is that is that something that uh is true

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#107:1:B>
Yes as a matter of fact it 's an accepted practice in <,> in China and Japan and even Korea
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#108:1:B>
You notice the skin of these people they 're very fair and very smooth

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#109:1:A>
And clear

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#110:1:B>
Yes because it 's an ancient tradition in these countries to to take a bath using herbal teas

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#111:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#112:1:B>
Now the extract from these uh the plants where we get the tea from <,> they have I think most of the vitamins needed for smoothing smoothening the wrinkles plus the moisturizing effect

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#113:1:A>
I know we 're talking about <indig> tawas </indig> but supposing we have you know for example in my yard I have <indig> tanglad </indig> you know the lemon tea grass or or this uh <indig> tsaang gubat </indig> you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#114:1:A>
Is that something that I can use too for for washing and bathing and uh using for shampoo
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#115:1:A>
It can be good

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#116:1:B>
Yes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#117:1:B>
It could be a daily routine and it would be very good for the skin and hair

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#118:1:A>
And the hair too

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#119:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#120:1:A>
I see what what is it for the hair that makes it good

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#121:1:B>
Well the tea because it 's a plant

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#122:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#123:1:B>
'Cause one very common <.> el </.> uh ingredient in plants is that you have well you have chlorophyll

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#124:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#125:1:B>
That is a <.> ve </.> a normal plant protein and that is very good for the hair
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#126:1:B>
And then most of these some of them contains <foreign> saponin </foreign> like what we find in <indig> gugu </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#127:1:A>
Uh-huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#128:1:B>
Some other plants also contain <foreign> saponin </foreign> with uh another variety

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#129:1:A>
I see
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#130:1:A>
You mentioned a while ago about uh you know this grass wild grass <indig> 'yong uh </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#131:1:B>
<indig> Kugon </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#132:1:A>
<indig> Cogon </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#133:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#134:1:A>
And you were saying that <indig> cogon </indig> also has uh is very good for shampoo

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#135:1:B>
Yes especially the part of the <indig> kugon </indig> where you have uh before the roots

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#136:1:A>
Yes

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#137:1:B>
That part
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#138:1:B>
That 's very good for the hair
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#139:1:B>
It helps the

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#140:1:A>
But just uh about how many inches from the roots

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#141:1:B>
About two or three inches from the roots

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#142:1:A>
From the roots two or three inches

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#143:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#144:1:A>
You cut it and you boil it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#145:1:B>
You get the extract from that and then that 's very good for washing the hair
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#146:1:B>
It helps moisturize also the hair follicles

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#147:1:A>
I see
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#148:1:A>
How do you get the extract
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#149:1:A>
You boil it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#150:1:B>
Just boil it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#151:1:A>
Or you pound it and then

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#152:1:B>
You can pound you can make a decoction or extraction <O> music </O> <&> break in the recording </&> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#153:1:A>
Sonny you have such a vast knowledge about uh <,> you know natural things you know natural uses of uhm trees plants uh barks and all of that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#154:1:A>
If there 's some people or groups of people who are interested in getting themselves involved in this type of uh endeavor would you be able to help them

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#155:1:B>
Yes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#156:1:B>
Uh I will be more than willing to help them if they just come to me and I could give them advice on how to go on and how to start with the some little things which could go <,> grow big later on

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#157:1:A>
Yes like for example you were saying <indig> cogon </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#158:1:B>
Yes <{> <[> <indig> kugon </indig> </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#159:1:A>
<[> You know somebody else </[> </{> can do it you know

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#160:1:B>
And <indig> tawas </indig> is only one of the <,> vast <.> mate </.> resources we have

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#161:1:A>
So now uh tell me about the soap

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#162:1:B>
Now the soap
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#163:1:B>
Our <indig> tawas </indig> line we have three basically three different varieties <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#164:1:B>
Now the first one is the plain <indig> tawas </indig> uh herbal soap which we we with the hypo-allergenic property which means it could be used even for babies
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#165:1:B>
Now this is highly recommended for pimples
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#166:1:B>
Now it takes about a week 's time and you have pimples drying up after using this
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#167:1:B>
And then the second variety is the <indig> tawas </indig> clear soap with <foreign> aloe vera </foreign> extract
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#168:1:B>
Now this as I 've mentioned before <foreign> aloe vera </foreign> is a moisturizing ingredient
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#169:1:B>
So this is recommended for dry skin
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#170:1:B>
Now the third type is our plain uh <indig> tawas </indig> bleaching soap
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#171:1:B>
This is not the transparent soap but opaque
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#172:1:B>
Now if you want the bleaching properties of <indig> tawas </indig> we recommend this one

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#173:1:A>
How long before do you get uh to see the results by using this soap

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#174:1:B>
Well our studies show from about a month to about an average of three to one to three <w> months' </w> time

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#175:1:A>
Uhm and uh of course with the astringent goes with it also some body lotions <indig> 'no </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#176:1:B>
Yes uh we came out with two varieties of the hand and body lotion
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#177:1:B>
One would be <indig> tawas </indig> with <foreign> aloe vera </foreign> <.> ex </.> extract again
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#178:1:B>
As I 've mentioned this has an a moisturizing effect the <foreign> aloe vera </foreign> extract <,> and then the second kind is the hand and body lotion with uh carrot and papaya extract

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-047#179:1:A>
