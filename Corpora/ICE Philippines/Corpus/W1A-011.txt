<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#1:1>
1. ( a). The difference of the 2 articles is that in the 1st
article, the intervention of the state in the economy is highly reduced; the
democracy of the country highly affects the economy 's growth.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#2:1>
The state possesses a great difference in economic development.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#3:1>
Whatever decision the state makes affects the economy.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#4:1>
Maybe because of the fact that the people control the future of their
economy based on their present actions and decisions.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#5:1>
Whereas in the 2nd article, it says that the economy is fast rising
ever since the Ramos Administration started.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#6:1>
The optimism showed in the second article states that the government 's
efforts will not be sent down the drain and that the state helped in the
economic dev't. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#7:1>
b. The strategies in the 2nd article is based on the decrease in
the public 's hold on the economy.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#8:1>
If ever the state 's hold becomes lesser and lesser, the economy 's
growth will zoom up.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#9:1>
In the first article it also says that the intervention of the state
is highly reduced to bring about economic growth.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#10:1>
So I guess both articles have the same strategy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#11:1>
c. The main player in the first article is the state, but it says
in the article that they are <unclear> one word </unclear> with state
withdrawal.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#12:1>
The public 's hold and functions tend to be underemphasized.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#13:1>
The economy 's development doesn't grow, but instead it weakens.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#14:1>
There are people from the state who are rich and still become richer,
while the others, <foreign> vice versa </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#15:1>
In the 2nd article, the private sector is given more attention rather
than the state or the public sector.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#16:1>
With the rapid depletion of the public sector, to the economy, new
strategies are formed.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#17:1>
And as the growth of the economy zooms even higher, the state is
greatly reduced. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#18:1>
d. The 1st analysis didn't quite emphasize everything I thought
were necessary, there were some things left out, like <unclear> one word
</unclear> did state withdrawal have to be done, and when it started.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#19:1>
Maybe they answered the question already by saying the first 3 years
of the Aquino adm. <&> =administration </&>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#20:1>
But I 'm not really sure.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#21:1>
Although the analysis of both were good and in understandable terms.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#22:1>
The strategies, though, were not clearly stated, and also who were
really pointed out as center of attraction. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#23:1>
2. The Philippines ' government has already been known for its
inefficiency & corruption.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#24:1>
But I think now the Ramos Administration is working quite well.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#25:1>
The service needed for economic development cannot be totally
attained or assumed by the private sector, I think the state should help in
the economy 's growth.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#26:1>
Each organization in the country should be connected to the other
orgs <&> =organizations </&> in the country.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#27:1>
They should join their services to be of greater help to the economy.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#28:1>
Maybe, one by one we can make our economy warm up, but together, we 'll
get there. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#29:1>
3. Power is basically the capacity to get others to comply with
the use of threat of severe sanctions or the promise of national rewards.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#30:1>
Having power means getting others to do your bidding by threatening
them something not good happening.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#31:1>
Power has 2 properties, Relational and intentional.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#32:1>
Power in the Relational Aspect measures the capacity of a political
actor 's power to another.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#33:1>
The other is intentional, in which you have a certain purpose why you
threaten others or get them to comply to your bidding. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#34:1>
A concrete example of power would be the Marcos Administration.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#35:1>
We were threatened by the Marcoses of punishment if we didn't follow
orders or the rules of the Marcoses, especially when he proposed the Martial
Law.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#36:1>
We were also threatened by the Spaniards with punishment and even
death, in our Philippine History.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#37:1>
When the Spaniards took over our land, they were controlling us and
were using us as slaves in our own lands.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#38:1>
And another example would be the American regime.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#39:1>
The Americans were supposedly helping us from the clutches of the
Japanese, but their true intention was to make us inferior to them. </p> <X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#X40:1>
1. What is Politics?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#X41:1>
Is Politics a restricted activity confined on what goes within
government or state or does it occur in all areas of social life?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#X42:1>
How would you explain the concept of Politics to Juan de la Cruz?
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#X43:1>
2. Is government necessary or can societies be stable and
successful in the absence of government?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#X44:1>
Discuss the present state of Phil. government and cite a current
issue. </p> </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#45:1>
( 1) Politics is the activity directed toward or taking place
within the formal institutions we call our government.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#46:1>
It may also be cited as the use of power for one 's own benefit.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#47:1>
Many people and politicians use Politics to gain power, and when they
do, they abuse it.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#48:1>
Politics is not a restricted activity confined to the government.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#49:1>
It happens all around us.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#50:1>
Maybe fighting over something like a can of food between two kids may
be called politics.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#51:1>
Depending on how they themselves and how or what they do to get what
they want.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#52:1>
I 'm not really sure on how I would explain the concept of Politics
to Juan de la Cruz.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#53:1>
Maybe Juan de la Cruz would be a type of person who would try
anything and do anything to get what he wants.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#54:1>
Typical attitude among us Filipinos.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#55:1>
Politics would be something Juan would use to gain Power.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#56:1>
He would use politics to be among the people in the higher and upper
class.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#57:1>
Politics would be just a stairway to power for Juan de la Cruz. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#58:1>
( 2) I 'm not really sure if societies can be stable and
successful in the absence of government.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#59:1>
They probably would have a hard time in decision making, without
anyone to lead or watch over them.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#60:1>
Societies would probably fall down and not be able to stand up
without a responsible, fair and just government watching over and governing
them.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#61:1>
A large society may not be able to decide for themselves and help
themselves out if not for a government.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#62:1>
I think the Philippine government is in a state of panic and shock
because of the flash floods and damages brought about by the monsoons.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#63:1>
They probably are in a hurry to make some necessary actions to fix up
the damages like dikes being destroyed, floods, and holes in the roads.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#64:1>
I think the government is also in panic because they probably are
deciding on how to cut the traffic jam in our country.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#65:1>
Everywhere is traffic.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#66:1>
In the provinces, in the city.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#67:1>
But I think our government has been doing their job, not really
excellently, but in a fine way and they may have been doing their job fairly
and justly.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#68:1>
So I think our government 's status is okay. </p> </I>


<I>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#69:2>
1. a) The role of the state in economic dev't in the 1st article
is to allocate/distribute equal power and control of businesses to both rich
and poor people.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#70:2>
The first article is against the withdrawal of state from the
economy.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#71:2>
If the state withdraws from the economy, big business elites will
have greater control of productive assets while the poor will be poorer and
poorer.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#72:2>
On the other hand, the 2nd article explains that the role of the
state in the economy isn't needed in order to achieve economic dev't.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#73:2>
In this article, the privatization process is the most appropriate
way in order to achieve the true economic dev't.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#74:2>
The privatization of the business establishments especially the big
ones will pull up our economy since privatization process will open more
areas for investment activities in the Phil. economy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#75:2>
b) In the first article, the strategy for development is the
intervention of the state in business.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#76:2>
This means that state plays a role in economy.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#77:2>
In the 2nd article, the strategy for dev't is the privatization
process.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#78:2>
This means that state withdraws their participation in the economy.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#79:2>
c) In the first article, the main player for nat'l dev't is the
state.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#80:2>
In the second article, the main player for nat'l dev't are the
private sector. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#81:2>
d) <h> Strengths: </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#82:2>
1st Article- because of the state 's intervention in economy, the
poor will be given a chance to also participate in the economy.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#83:2>
This will help eradicate the <indig> &ldquo; pagsasamantala &rdquo;
</indig> of some big private establishments in terms of pricing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#84:2>
2nd Article- privatization of businesses will help in the
economic dev't since there will be no or less corrupt officials.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#85:2>
Another strength is that state won't manage to run some big business
establishments which need great amount of money.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#86:2>
So, no need to collect taxes/funds from the people just to run such
businesses. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#87:2>
<h> Weakness: </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#88:2>
Article 1- If the state will intervene in the economy, this means
that more corrupt officials are there.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#89:2>
Corrupt officials will just cause the downfall of the economy.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#90:2>
Another is that the money which will be used will come from the
people.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#91:2>
So this means that even people will still give some money even if
their money isn't enough for their daily needs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#92:2>
Article 2- Overpricing of goods might be the result since it 's
in the control of private sectors. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#93:2>
2.) I don't think the state should privatize its <unclear> one word
</unclear> to have economic dev't.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#94:2>
The poor will be getting poorer since they won't have the chance to
participate in business affairs if privatization process will be implemented.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#95:2>
The poor will become poorer.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#96:2>
Overpricing of goods & services may result.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#97:2>
What the state & gov't should do in order to improve their public
service is to remove the suspected corrupt officials.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#98:2>
They should also apply some trend in the economy use by both rich
countries which they think will help in the economic growth and betterment of
public services.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#99:2>
For me, just the prompt payment of taxes by the citizens will
contribute greatly to the dev't of Phil.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#100:2>
I say so because, tax is the main and the hugest source of the Phil.
funds. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#101:2>
3.) Historically, throughout the years, power have been used to
let others comply with one 's wishes.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#102:2>
Power is use in order to achieve one 's goal.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#103:2>
Even in the earlier years, power had been already exercise by our
leaders.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#104:2>
One of the three examples of this is that about the choosing of our
nat'l <&> =national </&> language during the reign of Pres. Quezon.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#105:2>
We all know that Tagalog was chosen as our nat'l language before
because of the power of the Pres.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#106:2>
Another example is about the Martial Law during the reign of former
Pres. Marcos.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#107:2>
Without the knowledge of the people, Martial Law was still declared.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#108:2>
The last example which is the most recent among the three is about
the SPCPD.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#109:2>
SPCPD was also approved by Pres. Ramos even though many people or
majority are against its implementation.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#110:2>
So basically, the use of power already happened before. </p> <X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#X111:2>
1.) What is politics?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#X112:2>
Is politics restricted or confined to what goes within gov't or
state, or does it occur in all areas of social life?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#X113:2>
How would you explain the concept of politics to Juan de la Cruz?
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#X114:2>
2.) Is gov't necessary or can societies be stable or successful
in the absence of Gov't?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#X115:2>
Discuss the present state of Phil. Gov't and cite a current issue
to backup your argument. </p> </X>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#116:2>
<h> ANSWERS: </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#117:2>
1. Politics is a <ul> set of activities--as human activities and
social activities. </ul>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#118:2>
Politics <ul> developed out of diversity </ul> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#119:2>
<ul> Existence of conflict happens in Politics </ul> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#120:2>
Since conflicts arise in politics, then politics is also about <ul>
decision making </ul> in order to solve the conflicts within the activities.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#121:2>
And these decisions do not only come from one person, rather
decisions are from the people involve in the activities.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#122:2>
The decisions is called <ul> collective decisions </ul> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#123:2>
By the way, these human activities include power, influence, money,
authority, laws, bills, leaders, competition, organization, and many other
activities which can be considered as human activities.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#124:2>
There are 2 major components in the study of Politics--the normative
& the empirical.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#125:2>
Those who are interested in human activities are called <unclear>
<ul> one word </ul> </unclear> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#126:2>
Politics <ul> does </ul> occur in all areas of social life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#127:2>
Politics does not only happen inside the gov't but also outside the
gov't.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#128:2>
Base on the definition itself that it is a set of human activities,
so politics really occurs in all areas of social life, since what are involve
here are all humans.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#129:2>
And about explaining the concept of politics to Juan de la Cruz, I
would tell him that he is also involve in politics.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#130:2>
Rich or poor people are involve in politics so they should cooperate
and join the politics or human activities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#131:2>
2. No, societies won't be successful if there is no Gov't.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#132:2>
Gov't is necessary because it 's the gov't that plans, manages, &
imposes rules and regulations.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#133:2>
Without the gov't, lots of misunderstandings & conflicts will arise
than having a gov't since all if not part of the societies will proclaim
themselves leaders of the societies.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#134:2>
One will not follow another.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#135:2>
So what the Phil Gov't has is the division of power in the country.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#136:2>
For example, the Phil. gov't has air force, police, NBI, marines,
Senate <foreign> etc. </foreign> which are responsible for the task only
assigned to them.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#137:2>
Now, there is this SPCPD issue.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-011#138:2>
The gov't officials ( Pres., Senators, <foreign> etc. </foreign> )
are the ones who were given the power to discuss this issue not the armed
forces of the Phil. </p> </I>
