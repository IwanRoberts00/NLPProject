<bold> ZAMBOANGA CITY --

<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#4:1>
Government peace negotiators will meet Moro separatists today to
hammer out a solution to more than two decades of insurgency that has
pestered Mindanao. </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#5:1>
The three-day talks between the government and the <indig> Moro
</indig> Islamic Liberation Front will take place at the Dawa'h Center in
Sultan Kudarat. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#6:1>
But while the government said it would exert all efforts to reach
an accord with the MILF, the military reported violations of a truce signed
last week. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#7:1>
Topping the agenda in today 's low-level negotiations is the
identification of so-called MILF camps in Mindanao.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#8:1>
Both sides failed to resolve the rebels ' demand for recognition of
their 46 camps in Mindanao during previous meetings, the last of which was on
Dec. 12. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#9:1>
The two panels will also discuss the effective implementation of a
ceasefire agreement forged by the government and the MILF following recent
clashes in Maguindanao that have left 35 people dead and scores wounded. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#10:1>
Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice chair for political affairs, said the
MILF panel would ask the government to address the plight of about 110,000
Maguindanao residents displaced by the fighting. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#11:1>
Fr. Eliseo Mercado, chair of the Quick Reaction Team ( QRT)
formed by the government and the MILF, said both sides would also discuss the
results of a two-day workshop at the <foreign> Notre Dame </foreign>
University Peace Center, which was attended by Army and MILF field
commanders, and town mayors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#12:1>
Government panel chair Orlando Soriano and his MILF counterpart,
Aleem Mimbantas, will attend today 's meeting. </p>

<quote> &ldquo; The scheduled meeting of President Estrada and (
MILF) chair Hashim Salamat is giving us bright hopes for the success of the
negotiations, &rdquo; </quote> Jaafar told the <mention> INQUIRER </mention> .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#14:1>
Jaafar said the <quote> &ldquo; ceasefire forever" </quote> and
<quote> &ldquo; peace forever &rdquo; </quote> statements of Salamat and
Presidential Adviser on Flagship Projects in Mindanao Robert Aventajado on
Thursday <quote> &ldquo; restored our confidence in the government. &rdquo;
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#15:1>
<h> <bold> No to MILF demands </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#16:1>
Mr. Estrada had said he would not give in to the rebels ' demands
but agreed to meet Salamat late this month to discuss economic prospects in
mineral-rich Mindanao. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#17:1>
<quote> &ldquo; If I get to talk to Chairman Salamat, I would ask
him to set aside the conflict and help the government develop before talking
about their demands, &rdquo; </quote> Mr. Estrada said in his weekly radio
program <indig> &ldquo; Jeep ni Erap &rdquo; </indig> on Saturday. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#18:1>
Field reports received by the military 's Southern Command (
Southcom) in Zamboanga City indicated large guerrilla movements in nearby
Bukidnon, where they have allegedly occupied several areas and set up
temporary camps. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#19:1>
The guerrillas, armed with small rockets and mortars, were
believed to be strengthening their positions, having constructed bunkers and
foxholes in several hinterland villages in Bukidnon, Army spokesman Col.
Horacio Lapinid said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#20:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The MILF forces are not supposed to be there,
&rdquo; </quote> Lapinid said, stressing that this violated the truce that
called for both camps to maintain positions and refrain from firing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#21:1>
MILF guerrillas were only an &ldquo; eyeball &rdquo; away from
Army frontlines in one village, he said. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#22:1>
<h> <bold> No troop movement </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#23:1>
Jaafar denied any troop movement, saying the MILF was <quote>
&ldquo; strictly observing the truce signed with the government. &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#24:1>
<quote> &ldquo; We do not have any reports from our field
commanders about ( Lapinid 's) allegation, &rdquo; </quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#25:1>
Jaafar, quoting chief government negotiator Soriano, earlier
disclosed Malaysia and Libya had offered to host the peace negotiations
between Manila and the rebels. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#26:1>
He said <quote> &ldquo; secret negotiations" </quote> between
Manila and Kuala Lumpur were ongoing but the MILF was also looking at South
Africa, Indonesia, Turkey and Saudi Arabia as other possible venues. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#27:1>
The MILF, the country 's largest remaining <indig> Moro </indig>
insurgent group, has been fighting for the separate Islamic state since 1978,
when it split with the larger <indig> Moro </indig> National Liberation Front
( MNLF). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#28:1>
The MNLF signed a peace accord with Manila in 1996 and was
granted limited autonomy in several provinces in Mindanao. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#29:1>
MILF legal counsel Ferdausi Abbas, however, said his group
remained <quote> &ldquo; wary of entering into an agreement &rdquo; </quote>
with Manila, citing several provisions in the MNLF-Manila deal that have not
been implemented three years after the accord. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#30:1>
<h> <bold> Cause, solutions unclear </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#31:1>
Although fighting between Muslim separatists and government
troops may have ceased in Maguindanao, the cause of the clashes remains as
unclear as the possible solutions to the festering conflict. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#32:1>
Preliminary peace talks between the government and the MILF have
been going on for more than a year, but last month 's fighting in Maguindanao
has indicated the distrust between the two sides. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#33:1>
Anti-government groups have charged that the military
orchestrated the clashes to either force an increase in the military budget
or to help some officers get promotion. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#34:1>
Military officers and Christian civilians blamed the MILF, saying
the separatists ' main concern was protecting their criminal activities, such
as extorting money from drivers on a major highway and giving refuge to
kidnap gangs targeting Christians and ethnic Chinese. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#35:1>
The guerrillas denounced abuses by armed gangs of Christians and
the military in the 1970s, including the slaughter of 1,000 Muslims hiding in
a mosque and the rape of Muslim women. </p>

<h> <bold> Napocor: Bidding not rigged </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#38:2>
<bold> Clarissa S. Batino </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#39:2>
NATIONAL Power Corp. yesterday denied the allegation of a
Filipino supplier that a syndicate was rigging the bidding of its projects to
favor foreign suppliers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#40:2>
Napocor officials said this issue was being raised anew to
discredit Energy Secretary Mario Tiaoqui, Napocor chair, who is scheduled to
face the Commission on Appointments today. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#41:2>
Asiselo Gonzaga, Napocor vice president and chief operating
officer, said the allegation of Renato Santos, president of RV Santos
Construction and Development Corp., was unfounded. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#42:2>
Gonzaga said the contracts Santos was complaining about had long
been awarded to winning bidders.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#43:2>
The Napocor vice president noted that even the source quoted by
Santos, Galicano Matulac, had died in 1995. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#44:2>
Santos had quoted Matulac, Napocor engineer design manager, as
saying that his group had to award two of the three contracts for Project
1121 won by RV Santos to two foreign firms because of <quote> &ldquo;
pressure from above. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#45:2>
Santos said members of the Napocor syndicate got not only bribes
but also <quote> &ldquo; free trips abroad, sponsorship of wedding banquets
and Duty Free shopping sprees. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#46:2>
Gonzaga disclosed that Santos was the subject of an ongoing
investigation by Napocor 's internal audit department following his firm 's
repeated failure to deliver &dollar;2-million worth of equipment for Napocor
substations in Laguna as part of Project 1140. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#47:2>
RV Santos ' non-compliance with the supply contract has delayed
the project by more than two years, according to the Napocor vice president.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#48:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Napocor has called RV Santos ' attention to this
as early as 1997 but time and again, he has not been able to deliver the
necessary supplies on schedule, &rdquo; </quote> Gonzaga said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#49:2>
He said all of Napocor 's bidding were conducted <quote> &ldquo;
with utmost transparency and strict compliance with government-set bidding
guidelines. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#50:2>
Before a contract is awarded it must go through the contract
awards committee, which includes Napocor 's engineering, finance and legal
departments, according to Gonzaga. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#51:2>
Then the contract has to be approved by the management committee
comprised of top Napocor officials and group managers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#52:2>
The contract is then submitted to the board for approval.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#53:2>
Finally, the contract is evaluated by the creditor bank which
extended the loan or grant to the project. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#54:2>
<h> <bold> Sourgraping. </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#55:2>
A supporter of Tiaoqui and Napocor president Federico Puno in the
Napocor management team said the <quote> &ldquo; Velasco boys were getting
the flak for things they have no hand in. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#56:2>
Tiaoqui and Puno are proteges of former Energy Minister Geronimo
Velasco. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#57:2>
A Napocor source said a member of the board of the state-run
power firm was behind the smear campaign against Tiaoqui and Puno. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#58:2>
The board member was said to be &ldquo; sourgraping &rdquo; after
Malaca&ntilde:ang revoked the order creating an oversight committee on bids.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#59:2>
The committee was headed by Carmelo Santiago, owner of Melo 's
Steakhouse and a close associate of businessman Eduardo Cojuangco and
President Estrada.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#60:2>
Santiago has not attended any board meeting this year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#61:2>
Tiaoqui and Puno were last attacked by a Napocor employees union
in late December.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#62:2>
This was the same union who took their oath under Santiago. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#63:2>
The oversight committee was created after a scam on coal bidding
was publicized last September. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#64:2>
An international bidding for coal supply worth about &dollar;24
million was postponed after Malaca&ntilde;ang had intervened to allegedly
accommodate traders close to Mr. Estrada 's friends Robert Aventajado and
Atong Ang. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#65:2>
To prove it had nothing to do with the coal scam,
Malaca&ntilde;ang created the committee on bids. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#66:2>
But Tiaoqui and Puno, who were offended by the creation of the
committee, lobbied Malaca&ntilde;ang to revoke the order, according to
sources. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#67:2>
<quote> &ldquo; There is obviously a power play here but Tiaoqui
and Puno are above-board, &rdquo; </quote> another member of the Napocor
management team said. </p> </I>

CAMP ABUBAKAR, Maguindanao--

<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#71:3>
The government and the <indig> Moro </indig> Islamic Liberation Front
yesterday resumed low-level peace talks as the MILF chief proposed a &ldquo;
formula &rdquo; to <quote> &ldquo; settle the problem once and for all"
</quote> - - a referendum to determine if Muslims really want to be
independent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#72:3>
MILF chair Hashim Salamat suggested the referendum on the same
day President Estrada rejected another proposal--to have a third party broker
the peace talks between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#73:3>
<quote> &ldquo; This is a civilized way of resolving the question
of statehood to the <indig> Bangsamoro </indig> , &rdquo; </quote> Salamat
said in interviews with the British Broadcasting Corp. ( BBC) and the
<mention> INQUIRER </mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#74:3>
Salamat noted that the solutions the government had offered in
the past had <quote> &ldquo; failed miserably. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#75:3>
<quote> &ldquo; ( Former President) Corazon Aquino offered the
ARMM, ( former President Fidel) Ramos had the SCPPD but did it help? &rdquo;
</quote> Salamat said.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#76:3>
<quote> &ldquo; Certainly not. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#77:3>
He was referring to the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao
which started under the Aquino administration, and the Southern Philippines
Council for Peace and Development which was formed during the Ramos years.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#78:3>
Membership in the ARMM was determined through referendum. <quote>
&ldquo; Unless the MILF formula is adopted, the rebellion could go on for
more years, &rdquo; </quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#79:3>
But the acknowledged that the <quote> &ldquo; independent state"
</quote> might not comprise the entire Mindanao. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#80:3>
<h> <bold> Seven provinces </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#81:3>
<quote> &ldquo; Realistically speaking, &rdquo; </quote> he said,
only about seven provinces could be categorized as Muslim-dominated areas
<quote> &ldquo; because of the heavy influx of settlers during the past 30
years. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#82:3>
He said Muslim-dominated towns in Christian-dominated provinces
may choose to join the independent state. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#83:3>
Mindanao has 24 provinces and 20 cities.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#84:3>
Among the Muslim-dominated provinces are Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi,
Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#85:3>
Salamat said he is set to meet with President Estrada <quote>
&ldquo; two weeks from now &rdquo; </quote> in <quote> &ldquo; a neutral

Mr. Estrada plans to meet the MILF chair during his visit to
Mindanao, which is scheduled after Feb. 22. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#88:3>
<quote> &ldquo; I think we can solve it on our own because we are

<quote> &ldquo; We must exhaust all remedies as Filipinos to solve
our problems. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#90:3>
Earlier, MILF vice chair for political affairs Ghadzali Jaafar
revealed that Malaysia and Libya had offered to broker and host the peace
negotiations between Manila and the rebels. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#91:3>
Mr. Estrada also said the peace formula that the government would
offer to the MILF would focus on development of MILF areas. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#92:3>
<quote> &ldquo; I 'm giving them all the top priority in the
development in Mindanao, so ( that 's) the only formula, I would say, that
would be the best for the peace process, &rdquo; </quote> he said. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#93:3>
<h> <bold> After the fighting </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#94:3>
The government and the MILF resumed preliminary peace talks after
halting two weeks of sporadic fighting that killed at least 35 people,
injured scores of others, and displaced more than 107,000 in Mindanao. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#95:3>
The talks are being held at the Dawa'h Center in Sultan Kudarat
in Maguindanao province, between the ceasefire committees headed by Maj. Gen.
Santos Gabison for the government and lawyer Lanang Ali for the MILF. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#96:3>
Yesterday 's meeting centered on the reactivation of the
coordinating committee for cessation of hostilities ( CCCH) as embodied in
the 1997 general ceasefire. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#97:3>
Maguindanao Gov. Zacaria Candao, host of the meeting, said both
sides were still selecting who would sit as chair of the CCCH, an umbrella
organization of the government-MILF ceasefire committee, the Quick Reaction
Team, the Fact-Finding Team and other sub-committees monitoring the cessation
of hostilities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#98:3>
The CCCH was first chaired by the former Southcom chief, now AFP
chief Lt. Gen. Joselin Nazareno.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#99:3>
It became dormant when Nazareno was promoted Armed Forces chief of
staff. </p>

<h> <bold> No thorny issues </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#101:3>
As of press time last night, the panels had not discussed the

of a workshop conducted by the <foreign> Notre Dame </foreign> University
Peace Center. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#102:3>
Jaafar said the two panels set aside the thorny issues of
sovereignty and separatism and focused on workable solutions to frequent
skirmishes that have threatened to scuttle the entire peace process. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-001#103:3>
<quote> &ldquo; We have agreed not to talk about issues of
