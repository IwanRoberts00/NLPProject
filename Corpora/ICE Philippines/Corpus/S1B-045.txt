Guys uh Michael Jackson pretty good <&> referring to music just played </&> uh I liked Michael Jackson before but not so much now <O> laughter </O> but anyway okay it 's Christmas here on the set but we still have a lot of things to tell you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#4:1:B>
In fact today we 're premiering our health portion on the show so every Friday from now on you can count on us to give you the latest developments and information in health news that affect not only your health but also your families as well and uh your health update is supported by Generation E from Mead Johnson
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#5:1:B>
Help make your kids part of Generation E exceptional and extra-smart </quote> and of course somebody who 's exceptional and extra-smart is Alex 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#6:1:B>
She 's gonna give us a health update Alex <&> not recorded </&> 

 <$C>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#7:1:C>
Okay thank you very much uh Alex and uh we will be going to this serious health issue in detail as we speak with the <?> pediatrist </?> uh from the intensive care unit of the Makati Medical Center Dr Michael Wassmer
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#8:1:C>
Good morning

 <$D>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#9:1:E>
Good morning

 <$C>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#10:1:C>
Okay uh so uh this is not a good thing to say that business has been pretty <.> bu </.> uh I mean it has been pretty busy for you nowadays
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#11:1:C>
How many patients do you get on the average per day per week
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#12:1:C>
Let 's say dengue related

 <$D>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#13:1:D>
Uh there 's a lot of uh admissions and a lot of uh kids who are getting admitted in the hospital on a suspected case of dengue

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#14:1:A>
Okay

 <$D>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#15:1:D>
And uh some of those uh recover quite fast and the others uh require more intensive uh monitoring where uh in an I C U setting

 <$C>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#16:1:C>
Do you have a number ten a day twenty a day

 <$D>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#17:1:D>
I would say at least ten a day

 <$C>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#18:1:C>
Ten a day

 <$D>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#19:1:D>
Yeah

 <$C>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#20:1:C>
Has it grown through the years like last year it 's less and before that or is it still the same

 <$D>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#21:1:D>
Uh the number of admissions basically is uh the same but uh what differs is that uh as before that it was occurring on certain months
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#72:1:D>
Now we 're seeing dengue uh earlier like it 's a uh whole year illness as compared to before that we used to see them only in the rainy season
 <$C>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#23:1:C>
Why is that 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#24:1:C>
Is that a weather thing 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#25:1:C>
Is that uh
 <$D>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#26:1:D>
Uh I 'm not so sure on what the actual cause is

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#27:1:B>
There 's classic dengue D H F and then there is the dengue shock syndrome
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#28:1:B>
Can you define please

 <$D>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#29:1:D>
Okay when you say uh dengue fever this is basically a child who has had fever for three to five days and has basically all the symptoms of a viral infection like a cold a cough and everything and basically uh because of the persistence of the fever they consult their doctor uhm and uh when they do some blood test uh it shows that uh there is a reduction in their platelets and everything which could be classified as dengue fever
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#30:1:D>
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is basically uh more like the child has actual bleeding like nosebleed gum bleed uh G I or gastrointestinal bleed
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#31:1:D>
Dengue shock syndrome is basically uh there 's no bleeding
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#32:1:D>
You don 't see any bleeding but there 's massive loss of fluids in the body and therefore uh the blood pressure could go down <unclear> word </unclear>  the hypotensive and this would affect the other organs in the body

 <$E>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#33:1:E>
What causes this the dengue shock syndrome

 <$D>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#34:1:D>
Uhm well it 's basically a uhm immune-related uh it you the virus creates a reaction in the body which causes uh inflammation and it releases a lot of uhm what we call chemical mediators which uh basically uh uh drops your blood pressure and uh affects your other organs in the body

 <$C>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#35:1:C>
Doc Bam Bam Bam was saying a while ago that uh he he was a victim of dengue twice as a kid <{>  < [> and he </[> said he thinks it 's because he was a plump fat kid

 <$D>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#36:1:D>
 <[> Yeah </[> 

 <$C>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#37:1:C>
Does does that have a connection <,> the chubbier kids get hit get infected more or something

 <$D>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#38:1:D>
No uhm when uh actually uh <,> it affects everybody regardless whether they 're fat or they 're

 <$E>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#39:1:E>
Uh-uhm

 <$D>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#40:1:D>
Skinny young uh

 <$E>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#41:1:E>
Kid or adult

 <$D>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#42:1:D>
Kid or

 <$E>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#43:1:E>
There 's this notion <indig> na </indig> kids <indig> lang 'eh </indig> 

 <$D>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#44:1:D>
No no even adults in fact a lot of adults uh have dengue

 <$E>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#45:1:E>
Uhm

 <$D>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#46:1:D>
The only reason is that they don't normally uh adults don't normally go to the doctor right away
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#47:1:D>
They try to self-medicate and uh

 <$E>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#48:1:E>
Uh uhm

 <$D>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#49:1:D>
And before they know it <indig> yun pala </indig> they already have uh dengue

 <$E>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#50:1:E>
Uh-uhm

 <$D>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#51:1:D>
But basically it affects <.> al </.> all types of children

 <$C>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#52:1:C>
I see

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#53:1:B>
Doc uhm how do we detect dengue

 <$D>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#54:1:D>
Uhm the only way to detect dengue is to basically have a uh blood test done <indig> e </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#55:1:D>
Uh basically uh it 's it 's called uh uh C B C or complete blood count with platelets and uh if you monitor that and uh if your platelets are dropping then you are a dengue suspect
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#56:1:D>
Although this can happen in other illnesses as well
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#57:1:D>
There are certain tests like a dengue blood test or an <?> Elyssa </?> test which can be done but basically this can only be done uhm after the fifth day of the fever

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#58:1:B>
So <indig> kunyari </indig> uhm I noticed uh that <indig> kunyari </indig> my my uh little girl or boy has fever
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#59:1:B>
Do I bring him right away to the doctor since I know that this is the month <indig> na yung maraming nagkakadengue 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#60:1:B>
The rainy season <,> is it okay to bring him right away

 <$D>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#61:1:D>
Yeah well early consultation with a physician is always important
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#62:1:D>
Uh they uh have the skills to basically identify uh which children uh have uh a high risk or a high prospect for for dengue especially like uh when we examine the child and basically the child has very very high fever and yet uh on physical examination you do not see any locus or any area in which uh the child may have where the fever is coming from
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#63:1:D>
Then uh this child basically is a dengue suspect until proven otherwise

 <$C>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#64:1:C>
Why why are pediatricians uh the best people to go to aside from I mean as compared to other doctors
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#65:1:C>
Even even if you 're an adult you still go to the pediatrician for the dengue because they are supposedly the specialists in dengue

 <$D>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#66:1:D>
Well it 's because basically uh we handle so many cases a year of uh of dengue so we are basically uh more attuned in uh identifying uh patients with dengue although uh when it comes to adult I think an internist will be in the same realm as a pediatrician in uh diagnosing dengue

 <$C>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#67:1:C>
Okay

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#68:1:B>
Can I just call my doctor and say my my son or my daughter has this high fever and these are the symptoms can I treat uh that at home
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#69:1:B>
Can I treat that kind of sickness at home

 <$D>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#70:1:D>
Uh I think it would be best for the child to be brought to the pediatrician because uh the pediatrician will have to make a decision whether the child has to be admitted and observed in a hospital setting or can be managed at home

 <$E>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#71:1:E>
Is there a vaccine being uh made for this 'cause I know there 's a flu vaccine and there 's hepa <&> =hepatitis </&> so is there a vaccine being

 <$D>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#72:1:D>
I think they are doing initial studies or initial trials on a vaccine for dengue although I think uh it 's <.> be </.> it 's a little bit difficult because we are not dealing only with one strain there are several strains of dengue so therefore in order to create an effective vaccine it has to be effective for all the different strains of dengue

 <$C>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#73:1:C>
Anyway uh before we wrap this discussion up uh Dr Mike maybe give it to us in black and white maybe in just uh tips for the viewers at home uh you know before they leave the house they have to work <indig> na </indig> important things they should remember maybe just some several things that uh they should do or should not do uh with relation to dengue

 <$D>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#74:1:D>
Well uh uh I would recommend to all mothers and uh to all mothers or uh adults who have uh children or themselves persistent fever of more than three days uh or who have have episodes of nosebleed or gumbleed or feeling very very weak uh to please consult your doctor at the earliest possible time so that the necessary uh tests could be done in order to identify whether you have dengue fever or not

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#75:1:B>
Okay alright thank you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#76:1:B>
And uh well thank you very much Dr Wassmer

 <$D>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#77:1:D>
Thank you 
 </I> 


<I> 
 
 <$Z>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#1:2:Z>  <X> Welcome back to <mention> Points of View </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#2:2:Z> We 're talking about whether using one 's native uh tongue in the educational system
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#3:2:Z> Joining us is Ed Lapis he 's the head pastor but of <mention> Day by Day Christian Ministry </mention> President of <indig> Kaloob </indig> Cultural Foundation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#4:2:Z> We also have Bart Guingona he 's a theater actor and a director and Mrs Ledinila Santos Director of Bureau of Elementary Education DECS and I think </X> 

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#5:2:A>
Okay so you were saying <indig> na Mrs Santos na mali daw ang ano mali ang sinabi naming </indig> uh policy in terms of the DECS
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#6:2:A>
Now what is the real policy of the DECS

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#7:2:B>
Uh the real policy is that we 're just using the <foreign> lingua franca </foreign> 

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#8:2:A>
 <indig> Oo </indig> 

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#9:2:B>
As a pilot for a pilot study in sixteen grade one classes in sixteen schools in the region

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#10:2:A>
As a pilot project

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#11:2:B>
It 's just a pilot project wherein we are going to use uh Tagalog

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#12:2:A>
Yeah

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#13:2:B>
In the in the areas where Tagalog is widely spoken Cebuano in the regions where Cebuano is widely spoken and in Ilocano

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#14:2:A>
Ilocano

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#15:2:B>
Where Ilocano is widely spoken

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#16:2:A>
Yeah

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#17:2:B>
Uh from our roster of schools uh there will be eight which will be using Tagalog

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#18:2:A>
Alright

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#19:2:B>
Five which will be using uh Cebuano and three which will be using Ilocano <{>  <[> as a medium of instruction </[> for all uh grade one subjects

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#20:2:A>
 <[> But is this right right </[>  </{> 

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#21:2:B>
But in the second quarter we will just we will be starting them with oral <unclear> word </unclear>  <indig> 'no </indig> and probably oral English if they are ready

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#22:2:A>
But this is does this indicate a direction <indig> na </indig> eventually you really want to widen the scope of uh of Filipino as a medium of instruction in all elementary schools

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#23:2:B>
Well if uh the results of the study would show that the children will be learning better in the <foreign> lingua franca </foreign> then probably we could well not just immediately a policy but we could widen the scope of the experiment

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#24:2:A>
 <indig> Pero ngayon hindi ba </indig> they are already using Filipino <{>  <[> in terms of certain subjects like uh <indig> Sibika </[> mga ganon hindi ba </indig> 

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#25:2:B>
 <[> They are using Filipino </[>  </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#26:2:B>
Yeah they are using Filipino for uh <indig> Sibika at Kultura </indig> 

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#27:2:A>
Yeah

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#28:2:B>
Uh <mention> Good Manners and Right Conduct </mention> but uh and of course Filipino as a subject and reading in Filipino

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#29:2:A>
Uh huh

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#30:2:B>
And they use English for Mathematics and for Science and English as a language but in the <.> ling </.>  <foreign> lingua franca </foreign> experiment we will be using we are not abandoning the bilingual program

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#31:2:A>
Right right

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#32:2:B>
But we are just using the <foreign> lingua franca </foreign> as a bridge from the home setting to the school setting from the known language to an unknown language
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#33:2:B>
Uh uh we are using the <foreign> lingua franca </foreign> as sort of a bridge so that the children can be led step by step to the new language to a new setting in the school rather than plunging them directly <{>  <[> to something that is not </[> 

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#34:2:A>
 <[> Alright whether gradual or uh </[>  </{>  <.> whe </.> whether gradual and then do you know uh modulated and all that <indig> pero ang katotohanan nito </indig> we 're really going towards a policy where English will be de-emphasized and more Filipino will be implemented

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#35:2:B>
Oh no I don't think so
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#36:2:B>
Uh we are still uh as I said we are not abandoning the bilingual uh policy we are just finding out a way by which we could teach English better probably if we start the children in a lingua franca
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#37:2:B>
Meaning in a language <{>  <[> that is </[> not new to them

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#38:2:A>
 <[> Yeah </[>  </{> 

 <$Z>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#39:2:Z>  <X> So does </X> 

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#40:2:B>
Uh we are looking forward to the time when when they learn because I think studies show that if the child learns the concept in his own <{>  <[> native language </[> there is better transfer to the new language

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#41:2:A>
 <[> In his own native <indig> oo </indig>  </[>  </{> 

 <$Z>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#42:2:Z>  <X> So this is also trying to like uh students learn English better if we do that </X> 

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#43:2:B>
I hope we hope that we can that that they will learn English better because I believe there are so many studies <{>  <[> that have already been conducted </[> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#44:2:B>
 <indig> Oo </indig> so for example

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#45:2:A>
 <[>  <indig> Pag naintindihan na nila pag naintindihan na nila saka na mas madali </[>  </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#46:2:A>
Yeah <indig> pero </indig> excuse me <indig> lang </indig> I 'm sorry

 <$C>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#47:2:C>
How do we evaluate success uh because if correct me if I 'm wrong but uh it 's it 's been done I remember when I was a kid
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#48:2:C>
Uh an experiment like this was done where uhm the medium of instruction was uh was in Filipino

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#49:2:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#50:2:C>
And that was abandoned a few years later 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#51:2:> Uh obviously there there there 's a whole generation of kids who are running around very confused out there
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-045#52:2:C>
Uh so there 's a unless you can evaluate it and quantify its its success then uhm it 's just going to be an experiment

 </I>
