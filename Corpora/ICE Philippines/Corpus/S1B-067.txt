<ICE-PHI:S1B-067#42:1:C>
The interview was uh relative to the burning issues of those days
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-067#43:1:C>
It has something to do with uh issues raised during the investigation of the Senate Committee on Public Accountability otherwise known as the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-067#44:1:C>
It has also something to do with the the allegations made by uh the Governor of Ilocos Sur uh Luis Singson uh alleging among others uh the implication of the President uh on several other uh alleged graft and corruption and other misdemeanor

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-067#45:1:D>

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-067#53:1:D>
