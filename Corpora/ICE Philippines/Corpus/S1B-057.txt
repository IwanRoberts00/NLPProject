<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#1:1:A>
Uh Senator Gonzales <,,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#2:1:B>
Uh before we vote on the motion may I just uh interject one statement <{> <[> Your Honor </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#3:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#4:1:B>
Well I think the making representations with the Japanese government on a parliamentary level uh as suggested by Senator Lina is indeed uh worthwhile
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#5:1:B>
But I 'm also thinking that the biggest uh investors in our country are Japanese
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#6:1:B>
There 's so many huge uh Japanese uh companies doing business in the Philippines and I think uh uh appeal also <{1> <[1> uh </[1> to these uh Japanese uh uh businesses uh which are actually branch offices of industrial and manufacturing giants in the United States and who have actually uh have uh great influence upon <?> order </?> upon their <{2> <[2> government </[2> <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> can also be uh made and uh without necessarily without saying that we 're uh uh applying undue pressures upon them but certainly their cooperation in this respect can be uh can be obtained
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#12:1:B>
Don't you think so Sir 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#7:1:C>
<[1> Yes </[1> </{1> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#8:1:D>
<[2> That 's correct </[2> </{2> yes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#10:1:D>
<[3> Yeah </[3> </{3> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#13:1:D>
Yes uh certainly Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#14:1:D>
All extra-legal uh approaches should be done and uh this should include as uh Senator Gonzales suggested approaches to uh existing Japanese uh investments <indig> e </indig> in the country would uh I think produce a significant uh dent upon the bureaucracy in Japan

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#15:1:B>
Uh thank you <{> <[> Your </[> Honor

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#16:1:D>
<[> Yes </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#17:1:B>
Mr President there is a pending motion

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#18:1:A>
Any objection to the motion
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#19:1:A>
Senator Laurel <,,> 

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#20:1:E>
This is not an objection Mr President but before uh uh voting uh on the motion I would like to ask uh some questions also

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#21:1:D>
With uh pleasure Mr President

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#22:1:E>
Uh specifically on the point of <foreign> carageenan </foreign> </foreign> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#23:1:D>
Yes Mr President

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#24:1:E>
May we be advised <,> on uh <foreign> carageenan </foreign> as an industry export industry of our country
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#25:1:E>
Wasn't there a time that uh somehow the Philippines was the principal source of <foreign> carageenan </foreign> uh in the world

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#26:1:D>
Mr President uh not exactly of <foreign> carageenan </foreign> but of seaweeds

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#27:1:E>
Correct

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#28:1:D>
Yes

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#29:1:E>
Uh in other words there was a time that the Philippines practically had a monopoly of seaweed for the purpose of making <{> <[> <foreign> carageenan </foreign> </[> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#30:1:D>
<[> <foreign> Carageenan </foreign> </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#32:1:D>
That 's correct Mr President yes

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#33:1:E>
And how is it that now uh we <.> care </.> uh uh <foreign> carageenan </foreign> or seaweed uh is <.> ne </.> being uh barred by other countries
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#34:1:E>
Does that mean those importing countries like the E E C E E C C uh have other sources of uh of seaweed

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#35:1:D>
Yes uh Mr President there are now uh seaweeds from Indonesia from Thailand from uh Ireland <{> <[> among other </[> nations

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#36:1:E>
<[> <indig> Pa'nong <.> nang </.> </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#37:1:E>
Pa'no hong nangyari 'yon </indig> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#38:1:D>
<{> <[> Uh </[> 

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#39:1:E>
<[> <indig> Wala </[> </{> sila nung una
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#40:1:E>
Tayo lang ang meron
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#41:1:E>
Ngayon eh pati eh </indig> Ireland as you said Indonesia <indig> e meron na rin
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#42:1:E>
Naku kalaban na natin ka-kompetensya </indig> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#43:1:D>
Uh <indig> tulad siguro ng sikreto ng </indig> atom bomb <indig> 'yan </indig> Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#44:1:D>
<indig> Nung una Amerika lang ang may alam ngayon marami na </indig> <&> recording ended and continuation is in side B of the tape </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#45:1:D>
A country oh which produced uh <indig> bangus </indig> you know in a large scale and uh with uh with finesse
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#47:1:D>
But now our <indig> bangus </indig> has uh been stolen by other countries to put it very bluntly and now several countries are growing <indig> bangus </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#48:1:D>
So I suppose that uh the situation is much similar to what happened to <foreign> carageenan </foreign> 

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#49:1:E>
Mr President I had the privilege of visiting uh the principal or major uh uh producer of uh <foreign> carageenan </foreign> in the Philippines that is in Cebu

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#50:1:D>
Yes

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#51:1:E>
And uh I learned uh in the course of my visit uh in the plant that uh there were exports of the Philippine variety the very good variety exclusive to the Philippines and uh exported by our countrymen Mr President some of our countrymen uh which to my mind is a very unpatriotic uh act
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#52:1:E>
Now is that uh do you know Mr uh President if uh this exporting practice of uh choice Philippine seaweed is still going on

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#53:1:D>
I I uh I would suppose so Mr President because there is no ban against such exportation and uh as I earlier mentioned uh Mr President even the export of <indig> bangus </indig> fry which is prohibited is being circumvented uh as you know very well Mr President so I will not be surprised if uh this is also being done insofar as uh Philippine uh seaweeds are concerned

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#54:1:E>
Uh would you say that there is need to not only to enact legislation if there is no legislation to that effect uh prohibiting the export of uh choice Philippine seaweed that is the main source of <foreign> carageenan </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#55:1:E>
<indig> Meron ho bang uh batas ngayon </indig> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#56:1:D>
Uh that can be considered Mr President and uh for it is for this reason that probably it is best that this particular issue is really referred to the appropriate committees so that uh all these repercussions uh which which might uhm arise from our act on this issue can be studied thoroughly

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#57:1:E>
I understand I 'm just was just informed Mr President that our colleague in this chamber Senator Shahani has a bill prohibiting filed with this chamber prohibiting the exportation of uh fresh seaweeds
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#58:1:E>
I think uh we should have that calendared if possible and uh acted upon as one of the measures that this uh uh chamber should take with a view to alleviating the sad situation of uh confronting the <foreign> carageenan </foreign> uh industry of our country
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#59:1:E>
And then of course to be followed as suggested by the uh distinguished Senator from Mindanao of enforcing strictly whatever law we pass in this chamber
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#60:1:E>
Now uh coming now to to prawns

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#61:1:D>
Yes uh Mr President <,,> 

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#62:1:E>
Uh <,,> apart from uh <,> this uh uh <,,> <{> <[> move </[> to or suggestion that we try to send a a parliamentary delegation to take up in <.> th </.> behalf of our countrymen engaged in the prawn industry uh do you think it would be a good idea <,> to open the door now <,> to foreign interest investors so that they may go <.> ahe </.> get into the prawn industry in our country

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#63:1:D>
<[> Move </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#64:1:D>
Uhm Mr President I am not aware that uh it is prohibited of uh foreigners to do so even as of now uh particularly in joint ventures

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#65:1:E>
<{> <[> Uh </[> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#66:1:D>
<[> I </[> </{> my understanding is that it can be done

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#67:1:E>
It can be done
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#68:1:E>
And would you go to the <.> e </.> because that is now it would seem allowed by the Foreign uh Investment Incentives Act <indig> 'no </indig> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#69:1:D>
By uh by existing law yes and that 's my understanding Mr President

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#70:1:E>
<O> chuckle </O> Would you go to the extent of uh welcoming now foreign investment into this field where Filipinos are now engaged in

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#71:1:D>
Uh that 's what I was trying to say Mr President there <.> i </.> there seems to be no law that uh prohibits this kind of uh participation by foreigners

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#72:1:E>
In in other words Mr President my point is this
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#73:1:E>
Here uh the good Senator from Mindanao says that well we are behind in technology we cannot produce uh we don't have the equipment to produce uh copra that has very low content of uh <{> <[> what </[> is that

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#74:1:D>
<[> <.> Afp </.> </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#75:1:D>
Aflatoxin

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#76:1:E>
Well whatever that is Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#77:1:E>
So uh-huh we can uh the Foreign Incentives Act of our country that is now in the process of uh of uh <.> fi </.> being firmed up between the two houses of Congress will now allow uh or <.> en </.> even encourage uh foreign investors to come in here engage in the same business so that well at least the Filipinos our countrymen who are employed in this uh industry may not be deprived of their means of livelihood
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#78:1:E>
Uh would you <,> <{> <[> consider </[> that

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#79:1:D>
<[> <indig> Ha </indig> </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#80:1:D>
Mr President I am supportive of the amendments that have been introduced to the Foreign Investments Act
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#81:1:D>
Uh it does not mean however that simply because we are opening the doors a little bit wider to foreign investments in this country that necessarily this will result in the prejudice of our own people
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#82:1:D>
Uh uh I 'm not quite sure whether I got the thrust of His Honor 's question but I would like to just establish that premise
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#83:1:D>
And therefore whatever uh foreign investments may be allowed as a result of our action here in the Senate I will support

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#84:1:E>
In order to maintain our exports uh <.> e </.> export income in these particular industries like uh <foreign> carageenan </foreign> uh copra and prawns and shrimps

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#85:1:D>
Uh <,> frankly Mr President I don't uh quite see the point uh you will allow foreigners to come in so so that we will maintain our

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#86:1:E>
Well Mr President uh very simple
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#87:1:E>
If you bring in foreigners they will try to protect this industry that they are now involved in or probably control

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#88:1:D>
Yeah

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#89:1:E>
And so being in uh foreigners maybe Japanese they will <.> me </.> be the ones to negotiate and make arrangements with their country to allow uh uh the exports continue exports of uh the the Philippines

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#90:1:D>
Uh

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#91:1:E>
To

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#92:1:D>
Yes

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#93:1:E>
Of foreign markets

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#94:1:D>
Yeah now I see the point
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#95:1:D>
That that might be a good tactic to employ Mr President as long as we do so within the context of our laws and our Constitution
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#96:1:D>
Certainly

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#97:1:E>
Yes because uh these are industries uh uh which the Filipinos are involved uh in and as a matter of fact are adequately supplying uh for export purposes particularly
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#98:1:E>
The and we say that that should be a reserved territory for uh our countrymen but yet we have I understand forthcoming a transition period that would allow foreigners and probably this is if we must uh take the position that we will allow a transition period to for the foreigners to come in
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#99:1:E>
Then this should be directed towards that end although <{> <[> I 'm not </[> convinced about the wisdom of that uh move Mr President because that would be to the great prejudice of our people uh at least those who have invested uh uh a great deal of money in these uh uh ventures

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#100:1:D>
<[> Yes </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#101:1:D>
Uh <.> ma </.> Mr President before His Honor will continue <&> speaker E clears his throat </&> let me just uh emphasize that insofar as Japan is concerned in this particular uh moment we are discussing the uh decision of the Japanese authorities to prohibit the entry of uh prawns and shrimps which have uh more than uh zero point one percent antibiotic content
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#102:1:D>
And uh we want to emphasize that very clearly because trading with Japan in prawns and shrimps last year amounted to one hundred twenty-five billion uh <.> mil </.> million million I 'm sorry one hundred twenty-five million pesos <.> whi </.> uh dollar dollars Mr President which uh really is a lot of money

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#103:1:E>
And uh one last point Mr President I 'm particularly intrigued by the statement of the uh good senator uh that uh the move of Japan to uh bar actually to bar Philippine exports <&> break in the recording </&> <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#104:1:E>
Uh how would you draw that uh <.> deduct </.> make that deduction Mr President

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#105:1:D>
Uh actually Mr President uh we can perhaps uhm uh just speculate that uhm <.> Ja </.> the Japanese will do everything uh within their powers to induce to induce if not to pressure our country to uhm accept the presence of the U S military bases within uh the next uh few years after the expiration of the Military Bases Treaty in uh nineteen ninety-one
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#106:1:D>
And uh primarily we can tie this up with the with the statements of the Japanese Prime Minister himself when he was here uh who did not uh find it uh you know out of uh protocol to say publicly that Japan is in favor of the maintenance of the U S bases in this country
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#107:1:D>
So what I 'm saying Mr President that is this that it will not be above the Japanese to do everything to bring uh pressure to bear upon our decision-making process on the issue of the bases

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#108:1:E>
And that is what we would uh characterize Mr President as <foreign> realpolitik </foreign> meaning uh the harsh uh <.> ha </.> hard realities of international politics
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#109:1:E>
Do you think we we should be able to anticipate those uh realities
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#110:1:E>
Do you think we <.> sh </.> are in a position to resist such pressures

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#111:1:D>
I uh I really wonder Mr President because I am told that even Taiwan has been making unofficial uh shall we say sending unofficial uh messages uh to the effect that they would also wish to see the bases extended in this country and once the bases are extended in this country then probably we will be able to secure uh favorable uh loans

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#112:1:E>
And

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#113:1:D>
Uh Mr President from <{> <[> uh </[> 

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#114:1:E>
<[> And </[> </{> probably even the E

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#115:1:D>
Other countries

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#116:1:E>
E E C pressure <{> <[> is </[> tied up also with this uh U S military bases uh uh question

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#117:1:D>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#118:1:E>
Thank you very much <,> 

 <$Z> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#119:1:Z> Thank you Mr President <&> uttered by Majority Floor Leader Teofisto Guingona </&> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-057#120:1:D>
We really cannot discount that Mr President
