<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#3:1>
ABEL DIA surfaced from a deep sleep as the aroma of coffee and
frying venison came to him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#4:1>
He smiled and turned over, snuggling deeper into the frayed blanket.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#5:1>
He peered through a crack in the split bamboo wall of his shack and
saw that it was still dark.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#6:1>
Anyway, he thought, <it> Gene will wake me up in time </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#7:1>
In a few minutes, his breathing became regular again. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#8:1>
Generoso Dia, or Gene, slid another slice of the dried deer meat
into the frying pan and stepped back as the cooking oil spattered.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#9:1>
He glanced out of the lean-to kitchen to the east.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#10:1>
On the earthen ledge that served as cooking range, he flipped the
frying meat and the aroma made his mouth water.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#11:1>
He swept his eyes to check their meager breakfast: steamed rice,
black coffee with sugar, ripe tomatoes and fried <indig> tapa </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#12:1>
The fighting cock in the cage by the lean-to crowed his greetings to
the coming dawn as Gene speared the meat from the frying pan and brought it
down onto the enamel plate.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#13:1>
Lifting the frying pan to a corner of the ledge, he wiped his hands
on the back of his shorts and scooped a handful of peeled corn from a sack
near the stacked firewood, tossing the feed between the bamboo strips of the
rooster 's cage.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#14:1>
He pivoted to the bamboo outer shelf and gathered the tableware
needed, plunking these on a small table by the steps that led to the upper
level of their shack. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#15:1>
With a wooden spoon, he rapped on the split bamboo wall.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#16:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I don't want to be late for the trip.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#17:1>
Come on, <indig> Tay </indig> <&> short for Father </&> ! &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#18:1>
Abel grunted a reply, slipped out of the mosquito net, and
jackknifed into a sitting position.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#19:1>
He smiled at his son standing below with a wooden spoon, glaring at
him in mock anger. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#20:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Good morning, Gene. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#21:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Good morning, <indig> Tay </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#22:1>
C 'mon, I 'll just feed the hogs and the chickens, then I 'll be with
you. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#23:1>
Abel moved fast once awake.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#24:1>
He crumpled the mosquito net into a ball, then rolled it with the
frayed blanket and the pillow with the reed mat.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#25:1>
He shoved these into a corner of the shack and slipped down to the
kitchen.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#26:1>
He stepped outside just as a small arc of the sun crested the ridge
of the mountain.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#27:1>
He splashed water on his face and snorted with pleasure as the cold
spring water removed the last cobwebs of sleep out of his mind, then he
rubbed his face with a common towel from the bamboo rack above the clay jar
that held the water. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#28:1>
In the kitchen he reached for two enamel mugs and dipped them
into the huge kettle of boiling coffee, placing these on the table.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#29:1>
He opened a jar of sugar, spooned out the last of the foraging ants
and with the same spoon took out a generous portion for each mug and stirred
each one of them.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#30:1>
Seated, he started sipping his coffee. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#31:1>
<quote> &ldquo; God is merciful, &rdquo; </quote> he muttered as
the hot liquid spread warmth down his throat and side wards to his arms and
legs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#32:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Amen to that, <indig> Tay </indig> , &rdquo;
</quote> intoned Gene as he came in. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#33:1>
Gene sat across his father and reached for his coffee mug.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#34:1>
The hot liquid made him shudder.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#35:1>
Putting down the mug, he transferred a good portion of the newly
cooked rice from the pot to his plate, and speared a slice of the fried
venison and a ripe tomato. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#36:1>
Abel duplicated the movements of his son and the two tackled
their breakfast in silence.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#37:1>
Afterwards, they took their second mugs of coffee into the clearing
in front of their shack. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#38:1>
Father and son watched in silence as the sun crested the mountain
ridge and slowly spread light in the heavily forested area that sloped away
to the Ragay Gulf.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#39:1>
Their shack was situated at the foot of a high bluff with its sheer
face to the east.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#40:1>
Their front yard rolled gently to the Kambal River which meandered in
the forested area below them and debouched into the sea.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#41:1>
It was in the forested semi-valley to their front that Abel derived
his little income--the gathering of minor forest products, from <indig> <it>
almaciga </it> </indig> to wild honey, bananas and an occasional deer or wild
boar. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#42:1>
By roaming the forests and doing occasional <indig> <it> kaingin
</it> </indig> <&> slash-and-burn </&> farming, Abel was able to send his
only son through secondary school.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#43:1>
They lived alone, for he had lost his wife at childbirth.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#44:1>
No lowlander girl would accept a hand-to-mouth existence with him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#45:1>
The peculiar terrain of his part of Ragay divided the people into
lowlanders and uplanders.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#46:1>
They who lived by the sea earned their living as fishermen and
farmers, while those in the uplands, as <indig> <it> kaingin </it> </indig>
farmers and hunters.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#47:1>
Intercourse was limited to market days when both converged in the
public square and bought each other 's wares and products. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#48:1>
But Abel was content with his life, for he was by nature a loner
and seldom made friends.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#49:1>
His immediate neighbor who lived some five kilometers from him in a
<foreign> cogon </foreign> - thatched hut more miserable than his was a
Negrito named Iklim. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#50:1>
Iklim had also lost his wife to childbed fever after giving birth
to a son, Nog-nog.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#51:1>
During full moon, Iklim and Nog-nog would just show up at the Dia 's
place with a bunch of ripe bananas, a freshly killed deer or wild boar.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#52:1>
Abel would then add more rice to his cooking pot, roast, fry or grill
the fresh meat and they would have a feast.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#53:1>
Afterwards, Iklim and Nog-nog would creep to a corner of the shack to
lie down and sleep.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#54:1>
Their friendship involved a minimum exchange of words. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#55:1>
If Gene happened to be home, the two boys, only two years
difference in age, would seek their own corner and talk of things important
to boys of their age.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#56:1>
Gene took extra pains to increment his friend 's schooling.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#57:1>
Nog-nog had been able to finish only Grade Six in the lowland
elementary school.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#58:1>
This was not for reasons of dullness, but rather he just had enough
of the persecution by his classmates.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#59:1>
Short, his complexion the color of bituminous coal, and hair like
steelwool, Nog-nog was always the butt of jokes and pranks.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#60:1>
To avoid complications, he just stopped going to school.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#61:1>
He was a bright boy and easily assimilated whatever Gene imparted to
him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#62:1>
In return, he taught Gene woodcraft, from hunting with bow and arrow,
to setting traps for wild boar.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#63:1>
Nog-nog dubbed Gene the Uplander Nog-nog, while Gene called him
Brother.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#64:1>
Gene became so adept in woodcraft that he could cross a bamboo
thicket with nary a rustle or a snapped twig; he could drive an arrow through
a medium-sized deer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#65:1>
The families of Abel and Iklim were close beyond the ties of
blood and marriage and they were content and happy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#66:1>
Abel broke the silence just as the sun touched them.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#67:1>
<quote> &ldquo; So, Gene, today is the day.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#68:1>
From Ragay you will be reporting to the Army Depot in Naga.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#69:1>
Then what? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#70:1>
Gene looked at a scrawny chicken scratching the earth at his
feet, then answered, <quote> &ldquo; Perhaps, to Manila, <indig> Tay </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#71:1>
I 'm not so sure.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#72:1>
I 'll write, don't you worry.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#73:1>
My induction papers are there in that box with your papers that cover
this small piece of land and the papers of our family.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#74:1>
Remember, whatever happens, makes sure that that box stays with you,
<indig> Tay </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#75:1>
Okay? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#76:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Yes, my son.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#77:1>
And better wrap up what 's left of our breakfast.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#78:1>
Nog-nog is sure to be at the bend of the trail by the spring.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#79:1>
And I 'm sure that Nog-nog skipped breakfast just to be able to bid
you goodbye.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#80:1>
Let 's go, son. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#81:1>
Gene spotted his friend by the spring and waved. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#82:1>
Nog-nog sprang up, sprinted up the trail, embraced Gene, then
bowed his head before Abel, asking for the blessing of the old man. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#83:1>
Abel placed his gnarled hand on top of the kinky hair and said,
<quote> &ldquo; God bless you, my boy. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#84:1>
Turning to his son, he said, <quote> &ldquo; Gene, I think a drink of
cold spring water will do us good. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#85:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Yes, <indig> Tay </indig> , &rdquo; </quote>
answered Gene and looked at his friend.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#86:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Nog-nog, please prepare a place where <indig> Tay
</indig> can stretch his legs. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#87:1>
Arm in arm, the two scurried down the trail and reached the
spring, a good five minutes before the old man. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#88:1>
Gene eased down his <indig> tampipi </indig> <&> carrying case
made of woven rattan </&> on the ground and hunkered down beside it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#89:1>
Meanwhile, Nog-nog had cleared a space beside him and placed two
bamboo tumblers full of cold spring water.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#90:1>
Apparently satisfied with his preparation, Nog-nog squatted beside
Gene and looked at his friend.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#91:1>
<quote> &ldquo; When do we see each other again, Gene? &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#92:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I don't know.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#93:1>
They said when we were called that the cadre training would be for
six months.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#94:1>
Some say that it will be for three months only as the government does
not have enough money to train us for an extended period.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#95:1>
I will know for sure when I get to the Naga Depot. &rdquo; </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#96:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Nog-nog, &rdquo; </quote> Abel hailed as he
neared them, <quote> &ldquo; come here and help me with my <indig> tampipi
</indig> <&> carrying case made of woven rattan </&> . &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#97:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Yes, <indig> Ta </indig> Bel. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#98:1>
The Negrito rose and hurried to assist the old man.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#99:1>
They went down the trail, Abel leaning on the shoulder of the
Negrito, his breath coming in rasps. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#100:1>
The old man leaned gratefully against the bole of the tree stump
and sighed.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#101:1>
Pulling the rattan pouch he was carrying closer, he opened the
basket and lifted out the banana-leaf-wrapped food package and placed it on
the ground beside him. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#102:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Nog-nog, come here and pull your brother with
you.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#103:1>
I want you to eat breakfast as we rest my son. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#104:1>
The Negrito did not wait for a second invitation as his stomach
had been grumbling since the crack of dawn.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#105:1>
He had slipped out of their shack while his father was still asleep
to make sure he was by the trail when they passed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#106:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Come, Gene.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#107:1>
<indig> Ta </indig> Bel will get mad and might whack me again.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#108:1>
Besides, I 'm hungry. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#109:1>
Gene obliged his friend and they moved.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#110:1>
He reached for the tumbler and drank deep.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#111:1>
The cold water, tasting slightly of bamboo, revived him and he
leaned back against an outcrop of stone beside his father. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#112:1>
Nog-nog made straight for the food and squatted down.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#113:1>
With a shy smile at the old man and his friend, the Negrito
commenced eating. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#114:1>
Gene smiled approvingly. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#115:1>
Nog-nog finished the food and belched.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#116:1>
Stretching up, he went to the spring and lowered his face into the
shallow pool.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#117:1>
Kinky hair dripping wet, he wiped his face with the sleeve of his
ragged shirt.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#118:1>
Then he unclasped something from around his neck and sat beside
Gene. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#119:1>
<quote> &ldquo; My brother, I want you to wear this around your
neck from now on.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#120:1>
Please.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#121:1>
I know that someday it will save your life.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#122:1>
In a tight situation, try to reach the mountains where my people
are.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#123:1>
When you wear this, it will make you one of us.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#124:1>
You cannot be denied.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#125:1>
I 'll be here for you when you come home.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#126:1>
In the meantime, I promise that I will look out for your father.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#127:1>
Gene looked at the object his friend had given him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#128:1>
Threaded through a length of cured deer-gut was a piece of hardwood,
coin-like in shape, with indentions on both sides.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#129:1>
Try as he would, he couldn't make out what the indentions were.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#130:1>
He slipped it over his head and around his neck.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#131:1>
Hiding it in the folds of his shirt collar, he looked at his friend
and smiled.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#132:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Thank you, Nog-nog, my brother.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#133:1>
Thank you. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#134:1>
Gene stood up.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#135:1>
His father did the same.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#136:1>
<indig> <it> Tampipi </it> </indig> clasped in his left arm, Gene
proferred his right hand to Nog-nog.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#137:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Goodbye, my brother.

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#139:1>
Nog-nog grasped the proffered hand, clasped it with a firm grip,
then he embraced Gene with his left. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#140:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Come home, my brother.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#142:1>
The Negrito scuttled up the trail, paused, pivoted and ran after
them.

Abel heard the faint cry and stopped.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#145:1>
<quote> &ldquo; He 's forgotten something and I think I know what it

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#153:1>
The railroad station when they arrived was bedlam.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#154:1>
Gene and his father picked their way over bundles and packs and
groups of families hunkered down on the station platform.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#155:1>
They smiled and greeted acquaintances.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#156:1>
More than once, Gene felt a sharp slap in a leg as a friend or
classmate gave him an appropriate greeting. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-010#157:1>
Gene presented himself to a Philippine Army sergeant who was
standing importantly near the ticket booth with a clipboard.
