<h> <bold> Long break awaits execs of Kalookan </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#3:1>
IF MALACA&Ntilde;ANG approves a recommendation of the Department
of Interior and Local Government ( DILG), the Kalookan city government will
find itself without a mayor, a vice mayor, and eight councilors for six
months. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#4:1>
This is because the DILG has recommended the six-month suspension
of Kalookan City Mayor Reynaldo Malonzo and eight other officials for alleged
malversation of public funds amounting to &peso;39 million. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#5:1>
DILG Undersecretary Ronaldo Puno said Malonzo 's admission to
charges of double appropriation of funds have left the DILG with no recourse
but to recommend his suspension. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#6:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Since he admitted it, <indig> wala na kaming
option </indig> <&> ( trans., we have no other option) </&> except to
recommend the penalty ( of six months suspension).

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#7:1>
If he questions the jurisdiction over the matter, that is not up to us
to decide.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#8:1>
<indig> Sa iba nila itanong kung may jurisdiction talaga kami,
</indig> <&> ( trans., they should ask others if we really have jurisdiction)
</&> &ldquo; </quote> Puno said in an interview with radio station DZMM. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#9:1>
DILG legal counsel Julius Raboca said President Estrada received
the recommendation for suspension yesterday morning.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#10:1>
The suspension order will reportedly be announced anytime this week.
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#11:1>
<h> <bold> Waiting for Erap </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#12:1>
Malonzo and eight council members, including actors Dennis
Padilla and Tito Valera, are just waiting for President Estrada, concurrent
DILG secretary, to issue the suspension order after Puno forwarded his
recommendation the other day. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#13:1>
The six other officials who were included in the list are Vice
Mayor Oscar Malapitan, and councilors Chito Abel, Benjamin Manlapig, Edgar
Erice, Zaldy Dolatre, Susan Punzalan and Henry Cammayo. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#14:1>
Puno explained that since the case filed against Malonzo and his
six officials was administrative in nature, <quote> &ldquo; it is but natural
for us to submit a recommendation to the Office of the President. &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#15:1>
According to Puno, Malonzo admitted that his council had indeed
used the &peso;39-million fund for purposes other than what it was intended
for. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#16:1>
But Malonzo claimed there was nothing wrong with it, since former
mayor Macario &ldquo; Boy &rdquo; Asistio, his predecessor, had done the same
thing during his term.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#17:1>
Besides, he said, Administrative Order No. 47 signed by then
President Fidel Ramos gave local executives the power to move or transfer
funds. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#18:1>
<h> <bold> Political move? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#19:1>
Malonzo, who defeated Asistio thrice in a row, said the charges
were instigated by his political rivals.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#20:1>
He questioned the DILG for allowing Raboca to handle the case, saying
the latter was a close associate of Asistio. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#21:1>
He said the Department of Budget and Management is the more
proper agency that should be giving the needed recommendation to
Malaca&ntilde;ang. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#22:1>
Malonzo and his men 's case stemmed from a complaint filed by
Eduardo Tibor, a <indig> barangay </indig> secretary and alleged supporter of
Asistio. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#23:1>
Tibor filed dishonesty, abuse of authority, misconduct and
alleged conspiracy against the city officials for passing City Ordinance No.
9254 which transferred some &peso;39 million worth of unexpended funds to
support the supplemental budget of the city for 1998. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#24:1>
The amount was taken from the original &peso;50-million budget
allotted for the construction of a bus terminal along North Diversion Road.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#25:1>
The project, however, did not materialize since Malabon officials
claimed the 89-hectare where the terminal was supposed to be built was within
their jurisdiction and not Kalookan 's. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#26:1>
Thus, Kalookan officials reverted the &peso;39 million to the
city government 's supplemental budget for salary, cash gifts and incentives
for casual and regular employees. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#27:1>
Originally, the accused were charged with three cases of
misappropriation of funds in connection with the city 's budget for 1998.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#28:1>
They were exonerated from the two other cases but they failed to
contest the remaining case. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Selective phone metering mulled </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#30:2>
<bold> Aries Rufo </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#31:2>
A SELECTIVE version of the controversial telephone metering
scheme might still proceed despite opposition from consumers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#32:2>
This possibility surfaced yesterday when Department of
Transportation and Communication ( DOTC) Secretary Vicente Rivera announced
he is working on the compromise plan to break an impasse on the issue without
risking the survival of affected telephone companies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#33:2>
Rivera made the disclosure after he emerged from a Senate
hearing, where he testified and enlightened the lawmakers regarding issues
surrounding the DOTC 's local measured service ( LMS) program, or phone
metering scheme. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#34:2>
But Manuel Pangilinan, president of Philippine Long Distance
Telephone Co. ( PLDT), immediately rejected a parallel Senate proposal to
work out a <quote> &ldquo; special arrangement," </quote> which will cushion
the scheme 's impact on business and appease ordinary subscribers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#35:2>
Pangilinan said the proposal might run counter to the equal
protection clause embodied in the Constitution. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#36:2>
<quote> &ldquo; The potential issue on the selective scheme, is
that we might be accused of favoring one to the other, &rdquo; </quote> he
said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#37:2>
Rivera earlier ordered the National Telecommunications Commission
( NTC), to recall a 1998 order, giving PLDT a provisional authority to meter
local calls of subscribers.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#38:2>
PLDT is the country 's biggest telephone company. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#39:2>
But yesterday Rivera said he had issued a new order to the NTC,
this time, instructing the DOTC-attached agency to study a selective phone
metering scheme. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#40:2>
<quote> &ldquo; There are pros and cons, advantages and
disadvantages with the phone metering scheme, &rdquo; </quote> he stressed.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#41:2>
Rivera, however, did not disclose what criteria will NTC use in
selecting areas or sectors to be included--or exempted--from the metering
scheme. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#42:2>
NTC earlier reserved its stand on the issue, because of the
vigorous opposition of consumer groups and high-tech firms that provide
internet service to their own subscribers.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#43:2>
These so-called Internet service providers ( ISPs) use phone lines to
reach their own subscriber base. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#44:2>
But Rivera said there is basis to PLDT 's argument that phone
metering will discourage <indig> &ldquo; telebabad, &rdquo; </indig> or the
extended and unproductive use of a telephone unit. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#45:2>
PLDT was supposed to start the program in May 1999 by introducing
it in franchise areas outside Metro Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#46:2>
The program was supposed to be introduced in Metro Manila the
following month. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#47:2>
Under the stalled metered scheme, subscribers will pay 40
centavos per minute of call that exceeds 800 &ldquo; free &rdquo; minutes per
month. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#48:2>
Subscribers actually pay a flat rate for the first 800 minutes of
call per month.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#49:2>
The flat rate amounts to &peso;348 for residential subscribers and
&peso;748 for business subscribers. </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#52:3>
THE Philippines yesterday sold another &dollar;200 million in
20-year global bonds in the US, adding to the &dollar;500 million bonds sold
early January, to take advantage of the recent decline in US interest rates.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#53:3>
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said the government plans to
issue more bonds to replace its short-term foreign debts with long-term
obligations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#54:3>
The flotation of the additional &dollar;200 million bonds brought
to &dollar;700 million its 20-year benchmark bonds maturing in 2019. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#55:3>
Early last month, the government issued &dollar;1 billion global
bonds of which &dollar;500 million have a 20-year maturity while the balance
mature in 10 years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#56:3>
The Philippines became the first among the crisis-hit countries
in Asia to issue the bonds.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#57:3>
It was also the Estrada administration 's first sovereign bond issue
in the US. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#58:3>
The &dollar;1 billion bond issue received an overwhelming
response from international investors as total subscription reached
&dollar;2.5 billion, over 20 percent higher than the &dollar;750 million
offering. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#59:3>
The &dollar;200 million new issue has a coupon rate of 9.787
percent, 436 basis points over the benchmark US Treasury, slightly lower than
the 9.875 percent rate that the earlier 20-year bonds got. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#60:3>
The bond issue was managed by JP Morgan & Co., Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter & Co., and Warburg Dillon Read. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#61:3>
The government plans to issue some &dollar;500 million bonds in
Europe early next month following the warm response it got on its &dollar;1
billion global bonds in January. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#62:3>
<quote> &ldquo; The global bonds and Eurobonds will not be the
last for this year, &rdquo; </quote> Espiritu said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#63:3>
Government officials would stage a road show on Feb. 21 to 28 in
six key cities in Europe namely Paris, Frankfurt, Zurich, Milan, Madrid, and
London.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#64:3>
A five to 10-year maturity is being eyed for the Eurobonds. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Oil firms warned against abuse </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#66:4>
FOLLOWING reports of yet another round of fuel price increases,
Malaca&ntilde;ang reiterated yesterday its warning to oil firms not to abuse
the situation with unreasonable actions that will cause greater misery to the
people, especially the poor. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#67:4>
Secretary Edgardo Espiritu of the Department of Finance ( DOF)
said President Estrada has repeatedly sent concerned government officials to
relay this message to the oil companies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#68:4>
<quote> &ldquo; The President has been communicating with these
oil firms.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#69:4>
He has sent Secretary Mario Tiaoqui of the Department of Energy to do
this, &rdquo; </quote> Espiritu said in a radio interview. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#70:4>
He added that moral suasion appears to be the only practical
solution to the situation because the government has no control over oil
price increases which are dictated by global markets. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#71:4>
<quote> &ldquo; We are telling the oil firms that while there is
nothing wrong with making money, it should not be at the expense of the
people, &rdquo; </quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#72:4>
While the government cannot intervene in the pricing of fuel in
view of the deregulation of the oil industry, Espiritu said oil firms should
not abuse the situation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#73:4>
<quote> &ldquo; We have deregulated the oil industry, we are
committed to free market, but oil firms should not abuse the situation,
&rdquo; </quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#74:4>
President Estrada, for his part, said he and Secretary Tiaoqui
have not stopped appealing to oil companies to defer the increases. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#75:4>
&ldquo; We have not spared efforts to stop the oil price hikes.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#76:4>
The only thing I have not done is kneel down before these oil
companies, &rdquo; </quote> the President said in his program, <indig>
&ldquo; Itawag Mo Kay Erap. &rdquo; </indig> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#77:4>
But the President said he is willing to do that for the sake of
the people if such act would bring down the oil prices. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#78:4>
<quote> &ldquo; If by kneeling down we can stop the oil price
hikes, then I would do it for the sake of our people, &rdquo; </quote> Mr.
Estrada said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#79:4>
Despite this, though, Espiritu said prospects remain bright for
the economy for the last quarter of 1999, following the continued high growth
posted by the agriculture sector. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#80:4>
Espiritu said most of the beneficiaries of the agricultural boom
are in the rural areas where the majority of the people rely on agriculture
for livelihood. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#81:4>
<quote> &ldquo; Our farmers are experiencing improvements in
their lives.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#82:4>
Growth may not be felt in the cities, but it is now felt in the
provinces where many residents rely on agriculture, &rdquo; </quote> he said.

<h> <bold> House to look into sale of military camps </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#84:5>
DISAPPOINTED over the implementation of a law calling for the
privatization of several military camps in the country, the House leadership
has formed an oversight committee that would evaluate whether the law passed
by Congress has been effective. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#85:5>
Speaker Manuel Villar, in creating a Special Oversight Committee
on Bases Conversion and Development, designated Assistant Majority Leader
Allan Peter Cayetano as chairman with 10 others as members.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#86:5>
Most of them come from Central Luzon. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#87:5>
Cayetano said the special committee will give priority in its
evaluation to the unfulfilled obligations in the sale of Fort Bonifacio by
the Bases Conversion Development Authority ( BCDA), whose proceeds are
supposed to help fund the Armed Forces ' Modernization Program. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#88:5>
The evaluation will be used by the House as the basis for
amending Republic Act 7227 to make it a better and a more effective law. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#89:5>
Cayetano said the multibillion-peso proceeds from the camp 's
sale would also help replenish the government 's coffers to finance its
pro-poor projects such as low-cost housing and agricultural modernization.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#90:5>
The government is eyeing the sale of other military camps
following the conversion of Fort Bonifacio, Camp John Hay, Clark and Subic to
special economic zones. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#91:5>
The members of the oversight committee, aside from Cayetano, are

<h> <bold> 'Sinking' earth menaces Metro </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#95:6>
<h> <bold> Liquefaction during earthquake could occur in several
areas </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#96:6>
<bold> AREAS in Metro Manila lining Manila Bay and Laguna Lake
are in great danger of being swallowed up by soil that liquefies during a
strong earthquake, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (
Philvolcs) has warned. </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#97:6>
Liquefaction, according to Philvolcs, occurs in areas where the
soil is made up of loosely compacted, water-saturated sediments such as sand.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#98:6>
The movement during a strong quake could cause the underlying
foundation to become semi-liquid, Philvolcs said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#99:6>
Structures built with no special engineering designs against
liquefaction tend to settle or sink as the earth underneath them loses
strength, Philvolcs said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#100:6>
Philvolcs said the districts of Binondo, Intramuros, Paco,
Pandacan, Port Area, Quiapo, Sta. Cruz and Pasig City were affected by
liquefaction in the past. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#101:6>
New reclaimed areas, especially those along Manila Bay, have
likewise been affected by liquefaction by recent earthquakes, Philvolcs said.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#102:6>
Structures affected by liquefaction normally remain intact
although some may tilt. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#103:6>
<quote> &ldquo; Other associated liquefaction effects such as
sand fountaining, lateral spreading and ground undulation may also cause
damage to bridges, roads and other infrastructures, &rdquo; </quote>
Philvolcs said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#104:6>
Citing previous earthquakes, Philvolcs said liquefaction has
caused extensive damage to various areas like Dagupan City. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#105:6>
At the same time, historical data indicate that liquefaction has
selectively affected various parts of the Philippines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#106:6>
Philvolcs liquefaction could occur in areas as far as about 50
km from the source of a magnitude 7 earthquake and 200 km in the case of
magnitude 7.3 quake. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#107:6>
Studies of liquefied sites have shown that grain size, the depth
of the water table, and thickness of the deposits influence an area 's
susceptibility to liquefaction. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#108:6>
<quote> &ldquo; The soils in the city of Manila are very similar
to those that have liquefied elsewhere, &rdquo; </quote> Philvolcs said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#109:6>
The identified liquefaction-prone areas have a
characteristically shallow water table with thick piles of water-saturated
fine sediments. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#110:6>
These areas are those on the shore areas of Manila including the
newly reclaimed portion of the Pasig River delta plain, the Marikina alluvial
plain and those lying on the floodplain deposits and abandoned meanders of
the Pasig and Marikina Rivers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#111:6>
Among areas classified under high liquefaction zones include:

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#112:6>
* Reclaimed areas

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#113:6>
* Manila proper except the extreme north northwest districts

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#114:6>
* Malabon and Navotas

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#115:6>
* Western portion of Valenzuela

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#116:6>
* Extreme northwest part of Pasay and Para&ntilde;aque and Las
Pi&ntilde;as

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#117:6>
* Southwestern half of Caloocan City

<ICE-PHI:W2C-014#118:6>
* Lakeshore areas immediately adjacent to Laguna de Bay that include
parts of Muntinlupa and Taguig, Pateros, central Pasig, extreme western parts
of Marikina and extreme eastern Quezon City </p> </I>
