<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#3:1>
Nestor Divinagracia will never cease to surprise me.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#4:1>
He follows a different drummer from everyone else, a unique rhythm in
his inner mind which tells him when to twist and when to turn as he wends his
way along life 's road.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#5:1>
I follow a more ordinary beat, which prevents me from anticipating
Nestor 's directions.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#6:1>
The result is that I lose money when Nestor loses, and also when
Nestor wins, in his complicated schemes to invent a surefire winning approach
to cockfighting. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#7:1>
It could be because Nestor comes from a much richer family and,
freed from having to worry about supporting himself and his family, his
motivations are entirely different from mine.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#8:1>
Or perhaps his superior intelligence and wide reading make his thought
processes incomprehensible to me. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#9:1>
Whatever.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#10:1>
He blew my mind once again by visiting me in my house without warning
late one night.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#11:1>
I was watching TV with my wife and young daughter in the bedroom and
stepped out to the <foreign> sala </foreign> to behold an apparition from the
past.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#12:1>
The old Nestor sat on the sofa, <foreign> sans </foreign> sandals,
earring, ponytail, and shabby hippie clothes.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#13:1>
He was neatly dressed in expensive imported Dockers tan slacks, Marks
and Spencer ruby shirt, and light-brown Bally shoes.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#14:1>
His thick hair was cut short once more and slicked straight back.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#15:1>
He greeted me formally with a straightforward demeanor. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#16:1>
It was obvious that Nestor had gotten over the mid-life crisis
that had caused him to divorce his wife, become a ' 60s hippie called <indig>
Kapitan Kidlat </indig> <&> Captain Thunder </&> , and turn to magical
cockfighting despite his advanced degree in biology.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#17:1>
He was now once more the rich, sophisticated scientist who had taught
me all I knew about cockfighting. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#18:1>
In quick, clipped tones, he informed me that he had met this
unusual girl, Katrina Vandenberg, while exploring the Buddhist temples of
South Korea.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#19:1>
She was visiting her Dutch father, a diplomat, and Filipina mother in
Seoul while on vacation from her job with the Renault car company in Paris.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#20:1>
She was an engineering graduate of the French Polytechnic, the finest
technical school in Europe and spoke French, German, English, and Filipino
fluently. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#21:1>
She had become fascinated with our slasher style of cockfighting
during her visits to the Philippines and had become quite an expert cocker
through intensive reading and total immersion in our cockpits for brief
periods.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#22:1>
They had talked for days about their common passion and fallen in
love.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#23:1>
Nestor had married her in Seoul and they had just settled in his
house in San Lorenzo Village in Makati, which he had previously been renting
out.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#24:1>
He wanted Abet and me to visit and meet his new wife. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#25:1>
Abet and I, with our wives, had dinner with the newlyweds a few
days later.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#26:1>
Katrina was a most charming hostess.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#27:1>
The food, though, was very European, rather heavy with meats, and the
wines that accompanied every dish were unfamiliar to us.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#28:1>
I was greatly relieved when, after dinner, Katrina invited our wives
to chat in the <foreign> lanai </foreign> and Nestor took Abet and me to the
living room to drink some 15-year-old J & B whiskey and to shoot the bull.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#29:1>
Nestor outlined his latest cockfighting scheme.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#30:1>
He had abandoned magical cocking and was back to the scientific
breeding of four trios which he had recently imported from Ray Alexander and
Jerry Douglas in the States.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#31:1>
He had also acquired a couple of dozen Bacolod aces to enter in the
bigtime derbies.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#32:1>
But this was not the scheme; the gamefowl were just the means for
testing a new slasher knife which he and Katrina had invented and produced.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#33:1>
Our host opened the antique carved Chinese chest which served as
our coffee table and retrieved a small attach&eacute; case which contained
his <indig> <it> taris </it> </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#34:1>
He took one out and we examined it in detail.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#35:1>
It was shaped like a <foreign> <it> kris </it> </foreign> , the sword
used by Muslim warriors in Mindanao.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#36:1>
The wavy pattern, however, was only in the sharp edge of the knife;
the bottom edge was the same as in other slasher knives.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#37:1>
There were two canals cut into both sides to allow the blood of the
cock that was hit to spurt out.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#38:1>
It had a kind of arrowhead design at the tip, to maximize its ripping
action when withdrawn. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#39:1>
It looked deadly, but Abet and I did not know enough about
slasher knives to determine whether it worked.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#40:1>
Nestor assured us that it would prove to be the deadliest weapon in
cockfighting as it was designed according to his and Katrina 's formidable
knowledge of the mechanics of how a gamecock delivers its blows.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#41:1>
It was produced from the finest European steel alloy and on precise
European machines brought in by Katrina according to the exacting standards
learned by her at the Polytechnic.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#42:1>
And it would be tested in a six-cock derby at the Roligon cockpit the
following Monday and Wednesday. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#43:1>
It became obvious on our way home to Cainta that our wives had
been enthralled by the young, beautiful, and brown-haired Katrina.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#44:1>
They were attracted by her European sophistication and were
captivated by her stories of life abroad.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#45:1>
We were relieved to discover that Katrina had already sold them on
the idea of testing a new <indig> <it> tari </it> </indig> in Roligon.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#46:1>
For a change, it was our wives who eagerly offered to pinch some
money from their household budgets to bet on Nestor 's cocks.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#47:1>
With silent laughter in our hearts, Abet and I agreed to their
suggestions that we altogether put up a quarter of the 20,000 peso pot money
and bet 3,000 on the first cock, doubling the amount with every win. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#48:1>
The Roligon derby 's elimination round on Monday night had a full
house.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#49:1>
There were 98 entries and the champion 's prize reached more than 1.2
million pesos.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#50:1>
Our wives insisted on coming with us, and had bought new dresses and
had had their hair done for the occasion.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#51:1>
Like all beginners in cockfighting, they were absolutely certain that
the championship belonged to us.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#52:1>
I must admit that Abet and I were also excited by the prospect of
winning a quarter of the championship purse, which was 300 thousand pesos.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#53:1>
The first fight of our entry, which Nestor had named <foreign>
<it> Kris </it> </foreign> , was called at nine p.m.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#54:1>
We rushed to join Nestor and Katrina in their cockhouse.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#55:1>
The cock was already in a small limbering cage, being warmed up by
Nestor through teasing it with a catchcock.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#56:1>
It was an impressively tall gray with long silver hackles, refined
green shanks and toes, and a tail so long that its streamers had been cut to
keep them from reaching the ground.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#57:1>
The cock was obviously alert and extremely aggressive; it tried to
strike the catchcock twice and only Nestor 's quick reflexes kept the gray
from fighting before its appointed time.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#58:1>
Abet and I were explaining to our wives the especially fine points of
the gray when the cockpit runner arrived to tell us to heel the knife on our
cock. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#59:1>
Nestor performed the elaborate ritual of tying on the slasher.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#60:1>
He wound the cotton padding around the cock 's left spur with deft
motions and carefully adjusted it so that it would provide a firm base with a
perfect trajectory for the knife.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#61:1>
Nestor took his miniature <foreign> <it> kris </it> </foreign> ,
pressed its forked base firmly onto the padding, and precisely aligned it
with the cock 's breastbone, prop toe, and asshole.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#62:1>
We did not stay to watch him secure the knife with endless loops of
waxed string and electrical tape and, later, to fasten the sheath.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#63:1>
We hurried back to our ringside seats, worried that the overflowing
crowd may have grabbed them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#64:1>
Pride welled up in us when Nestor entered the pit with the
thoroughbred gray.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#65:1>
He let the gray loose for a couple of minutes: it goose-stepped
slowly around the ring with a measured rhythm, stopped often to heartily crow
its challenge to the world, and went back to Nestor to be picked up.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#66:1>
The impressive display made the gray a favorite and the odds were ten
to eight in our favor by the time Nestor 's handler started to enrage the
gray by making the catchcock peck it repeatedly in the ears. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#67:1>
The gray rose six feet in the air during the first buckle and
drove its knife deep into its red opponent 's chest.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#68:1>
The red collapsed and our cock quickly killed it on the ground with a
murderous shuffle.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#69:1>
The crowd clapped at the awesome display of ferocity, strength, and
accuracy of the gray. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#70:1>
Nestor broke out a bottle of Remy Martin VSOP cognac to cap our
jubilation in the cockhouse.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#71:1>
The gray was unhurt and was put back into its holding stall.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#72:1>
Nestor and I went to see the damage the new knife had inflicted on
the gray 's opponent.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#73:1>
It was a sickening sight: the red 's chest had been torn apart and we
could see part of its stilled heart and ripped lungs through the monstrous
wound; its right leg was nearly severed at the hip from the ground shuffle.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#74:1>
I was awed by the terrible damage wrought by Nestor 's invention.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#75:1>
News of the deadly <indig> <it> tari </it> </indig> spread
quickly through the crowd and our next fight was delayed by a protest lodged
by the opposing entry against our unconventional weapon.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#76:1>
The cockpit owner inspected the <indig> <it> tari </it> </indig>
himself and ruled it legal because it had the same dimensions as the opponent 's
knife.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#77:1>
It helped a lot that Nestor and the owner had been classmates at the
Ateneo in their youth. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#78:1>
We were heavy favorites in our second fight, and rightly so, for
it ended as quickly as the first one.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#79:1>
Our second gray cock, a full brother to the first, got its white
opponent on the first fly with a billhold and drove it to the ground with an
air-borne shuffle.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#80:1>
Our cock didn't let go of its billhold and never stopped hitting: the
referee had to forcibly pull it away when he was certain the white cock was
stone dead.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#81:1>
Again, the crowd clapped. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#82:1>
The usual hangers-on milled about the cockhouse, greedily
imbibing the winning vibrations from the <foreign> <it> Kris </it> </foreign>
entry that had just topped the elimination round with perfection.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#83:1>
Nestor and Katrina were animatedly discussing the finer points of
their knife with their backs turned to the crowd, so as not to reveal their
secret.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#84:1>
We drank some <foreign> cognac </foreign> for a while with our wives,
but had to leave shortly, as Abet and I had to report for work early that
morning. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#85:1>
We may as well not have gone to work on Tuesday and Wednesday.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#86:1>
The glory of Monday night lingered in our minds and we spent most of
our time in our offices on the phone, endlessly reliving both fights and
elevating them to myths with each recounting.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#87:1>
This made the interminable waiting for the final round of the derby
on Wednesday night a bit more bearable. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#88:1>
We had won nearly 6,000 pesos in the elimination round and our
wives decided to invest a good part of it on new outfits and hairdos for the
championship round.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#89:1>
We did not complain, as Abet and I had won another 4,000 pesos with
furtive side bets on the two grays.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#90:1>
Thus did we go that Wednesday night to the Roligon cockpit, our wives
decked out for a dinner party and Abet and I with singing hearts from our
secret winnings and our dreams of grabbing a share of the gigantic
championship prize. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#91:1>
The bettors at ringside were lavish in their praise of our deadly
cocks.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#92:1>
This spurred Abet and me to hold forth at some length on the art and
science of cockfighting.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#93:1>
Our confidence in our expertise must have been catching, for the
whole second row at ringside bet on our choices for the first four fights.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#94:1>
We won all our bets. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#95:1>
The fifth fight was our entry and we scrambled to the cockhouse
to lend moral support to Nestor and Katrina as they prepared the cock for
battle.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#96:1>
The cock was a splash red, the type that is called a <indig> <it>
lasak-langawin </it> </indig> because the countless white flecks on its red
and black feathers make the cock look like hundreds of flies have descended
on it.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#97:1>
It was another magnificent Bacolod cock, restlessly pacing its
limbering cage, wishing only to be let loose so that it could explode in
fury. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#98:1>
After the runner told us the fight was on, Nestor calmly brought
the <indig> <it> lasak </it> </indig> to the cockpit office to weigh it
before the eagle-eyed opposing entry and the derby managers.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#99:1>
Then he heeled the cock and pushed his way through the crowd to the
pit.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#100:1>
We followed in his wake; once in the pit, we whispered sundry inane
comments in his ear as he waited for the <foreign> <it> casador </it>
</foreign> to match the center bets.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#101:1>
It was our way of making sure that everyone knew that we were
partners in the <foreign> <it> Kris </it> </foreign> entry. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#102:1>
The splash red was a hothead and rushed to its white opponent
upon being released.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#103:1>
The white glided ever so slightly to its left to evade our cock 's
charge, turned, and pounded our <indig> <it> lasak </it> </indig> 's back
before it could stop its forward momentum.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#104:1>
The crowd roared at what looked like a fatal blow, but our cock
wasn't finished yet.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#105:1>
The white 's knife had got stuck on our cock 's back and the turning
of our cock sent the white tumbling.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#106:1>
This was all the <indig> <it> lasak </it> </indig> needed: it
quickly got a billhold and turned on a fierce shuffle that immediately killed
the white.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#107:1>
The <indig> <it> lasak </it> </indig> was spitting blood and losing
consciousness, but its toughness enabled it to peck twice in the <foreign>
<it> careo </it> </foreign> before dying.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#108:1>
We had won our third fight. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#109:1>
The fourth fight was not as close.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#110:1>
Our cock was another beautiful gray, full brother to the two that
had won handily in the elimination round.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#111:1>
It topped its blue opponent and destroyed its left wing.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-013#112:1>
It got hit in the furious shuffling which followed the first buckle,
but won because the crippled wing was too big a disadvantage for the blue to
overcome. </p> </I>
