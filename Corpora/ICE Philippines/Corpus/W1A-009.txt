<h> <bold> Introduction </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#5:1>
The preoccupation of Cavite&ntilde;o historiography with the
1896-98 &ldquo; watershed &rdquo; produced a marked genre of town histories,
which are nationalist, political and hero-centered.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#6:1>
These works were instrumental in bolstering the Cavite&ntilde;o 's
enthusiasm for history and homegrown heroism.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#7:1>
It should be stressed however, that there 's more to the Tagalog
province than the sagas of men in <foreign> <it> rayadillo </it> </foreign> .
<fnr> <sp> 1 </sp> </fnr> <footnote> <foreign> <it> rayadillo </it>
</foreign> - the standard blue and white striped uniform of the army of the
First Philippine Republic. </footnote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#8:1>
This study aims to be part of the growing body of works that dared to
go beyond the bounds of politics, into the sparsely explored realm of
Cavite&ntilde;o religious history. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#9:1>
<h> <bold> Background of the Problem </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#10:1>
Literature-wise, that of the Virgin of <foreign> <it> Porta Vaga
</it> </foreign> of Cavite City remains the most explored religious devotion
in the province. <fnr> <sp> 2 </sp> </fnr> <footnote> Officially named
<foreign> <it> Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Soledad de Porta Vaga </it>
</foreign> ( Our Lady of Solitude of Porta Vaga), it is a small painting of
the Virgin Mary on the night of Good Friday.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#11:1>
The Virgin is shown wearing mourning robes while contemplating the
instruments of Jesus ' passion.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#12:1>
This 17th century icon was supposedly found floating near the Porta
Vaga gate of the walled port city, the day after a Spanish sentry claimed to
have witnessed a nocturnal apparition of the Virgin.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#13:1>
Popular devotion to this icon was tied to the galleon trade and its
perceived role in abating the 1882 cholera epidemic that swept the province.
</footnote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#14:1>
It continues to be the focal point of grandiose hispanized
festivities dating back from the time of the galleons ( although it suffered
a decline after the city was destroyed by Japanese bombs in 1941).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#15:1>
Extant historical writings on the said icon dates back to the 17th
century.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#16:1>
Contemporary scholarly literature on the subject is readily available
in libraries and even the world-wide web.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#17:1>
Apart from this, at least two other towns in Cavite hosts devotions
of similar following ( but received lesser scholarly attention): Ternate (
<foreign> <it> Santo Ni&ntilde;o </it> </foreign> ) and Tanza ( <foreign>
<it> San Agustin </it> </foreign> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#18:1>
In both cases, the devotion does not only show borrowed colonial
elements, but more importantly, indigenous idioms woven into the complex web
of ritual and folklore.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#19:1>
The cult of the <foreign> <it> Santo Ni&ntilde;o </it> </foreign> in
Ternate for instance, is not only the focus of massive January pilgrimages.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#20:1>
It also has been the object of curiosity of local researchers,
fascinated by the devotion 's eclectic interplay of Filipino, Spanish and
Indonesian ( <foreign> <it> Mardikas </it> </foreign> ) historical
connections. <fnr> <sp> 3 </sp> </fnr> <footnote> This image of the <foreign>
Santo Ni&ntilde;o </foreign> was brought to the country in 1663 by a group of
East Indian Christian converts called the <mention> <foreign> <it> Mardikas
</it> </foreign> </mention> , who chose to follow the Spaniards after the
fall of the port of Ternate in the Spice Islands ( now known as the Maluku
Islands).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#21:1>
Apart from the dark skinned Christ Child, the <foreign> <it> Mardikas
</it> </foreign> also left two tangible legacies of their East Indian
homeland: the current town adopted the name <mention> <it> Ternate </it>
</mention> and a patois called <mention> <foreign> <it> Ternate chavacano
</it> </foreign> </mention> ( unique for its intermingling of Filipino,
Spanish and Indonesian words). </footnote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#22:1>
It is the <foreign> <it> San Agustin </it> </foreign> devotion of
Tanza however, that remains relatively untapped.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#23:1>
This, despite being a mainstay of Cavite&ntilde;o popular culture for
more than two centuries now.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#24:1>
Every 28th of August, devotees flock to this lowland town to pay
homage to <indig> <it> Tata Usteng </it> </indig> ( as he is fondly called.)

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#25:1>
Curiously, this day is not even the official fiesta of the town 's
major parish, nor is <foreign> San Agustin </foreign> the real patron of the
town.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#26:1>
How this phenomenon grew in such an unusual circumstance made it
somewhat an object of curiosity.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#27:1>
More interesting, are the multi-faceted roles that <foreign> <it> San
Agustin </it> </foreign> plays in this town 's social life: patron yet not,
local patriarch, rain and water deity, miracle-worker, community symbol.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#28:1>
Such a unique religious tradition deserves not only a second look.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#29:1>
For delving into this subject may shed light on the dynamics of the
Tanze&ntilde;os' perception of the heavenly, and more importantly, their own
history. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#30:1>
<h> <bold> Statement of the Problem </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#31:1>
This study focuses on the history of the devotion to the 18th
century image Saint Augustine of Hippo enshrined in the municipality of
Tanza, Cavite ( formerly, <foreign> Santa Cruz de Malabon </foreign> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#32:1>
Specifically, it aims to draw a preliminary survey of the said
devotion 's history.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#33:1>
Towards this end, it is particularly important to dwell into the
following problems:

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#34:1>
1. How did the San Agustin devotion start in Tanza?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#35:1>
2. What were the developments that marked the devotion 's rise from
an obscure saint cult in the early 19th century to one of Cavite 's most
popular religious traditions in modern times?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#36:1>
3. What were the marked changes in Tanza 's devotional text ( novena)
and how does it reflect the historical shifts in attitude of the local
clergy?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#37:1>
4. How does the oral tradition revolving around the devotion mirror a
particular historical mentality of the town? </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#38:1>
<h> <bold> The Significance of the Study </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#39:1>
There was renewed enthusiasm towards the origins of the devotion
to <foreign> <it> San Agustin </it> </foreign> since the 1990s.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#40:1>
This was especially evident in 1995 when the people of Tanza
celebrated the 200th anniversary of the discovery of the said image.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#41:1>
To put an emphasis on the long history of the devotion, an exhibit
highlighted the celebrations.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#42:1>
Featured in the exhibit, among other things, were the saint 's
&ldquo; belongings": finely embroidered clothes, antique miters and staffs,
old photos, invitation, novenas <foreign> etc. </foreign>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#43:1>
At the same time, short articles about the history of the said image
( including alleged contemporary miracles) were published in souvenir
programs and other tracks.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#44:1>
The discovery of the image was even re-enacted through the narrow
streets of the <foreign> <it> poblacion </it> </foreign> , functioning as a
visual history book for the throngs of people who gathered.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#45:1>
These efforts are enough assurances that at least, &ldquo; <foreign>
<it> San Agustin </it> </foreign> histories &rdquo; exists at the communal
level, and is very much part of popular consciousness.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#46:1>
The term <mention> &ldquo; histories &rdquo; </mention> is used to
highlight the plurality and the fragmentary nature of these accounts ( oral
and written).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#47:1>
What 's interesting is that despite the popularity of such, there was
no effort to gather or organize these into a more formal and scholarly
narrative.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#48:1>
It is for this reason that this study is primarily conceived: to come
up with a short monograph that would give readers an overview of the history
of the <indig> <it> Tata Usteng </it> </indig> phenomenon, as sources permit.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#49:1>
This study will not only be of use within the bounds of religious
history, but of local history as well.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#50:1>
Since 1998, Cavite saw an increase in the number of town histories
published locally, apart from the traditional texts that had become perennial
features in souvenir programs.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#51:1>
Towns like Kawit, Noveleta and Silang can now boast of comprehensive
histories of more scholarly tone.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#52:1>
Tanza, on the other hand, has yet to see a comprehensive town history
in print.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#53:1>
Local historical committees and teachers had already initiated
efforts to achieve the end, particularly in the political plane.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#54:1>
Even earlier than this, previous efforts of native historians had
already made considerable gains, especially when it comes to the role of the
town in the Philippine Revolution ( Austria, 2001: 30-31). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#55:1>
There 's still much to be done however, if it 's a <quote>
&ldquo; total history &rdquo; </quote> that is wanted.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#56:1>
New developments in historical research had pushed to the forefront
this supreme ideal.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#57:1>
As the historical field embraces the whole of human experience as its
subject, the narrative centered in politics, or what happened in the town, is
deconstructed.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#58:1>
Therefore, total histories are looking towards studies of subjects
that are not to be found nor were given emphasis in local historiography.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#59:1>
This has always been the dilemma of Cavite&ntilde;o
historiography.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#60:1>
Same with Tanza.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#61:1>
In the past, prime importance was given to topics like Aguinaldo 's
oath-taking at Sta. Cruz convent ( 1897) <fnr> <sp> 4 </sp> </fnr> ,
native-born national officials, the succession of mayors and other town
officials, <foreign> etc. </foreign> <footnote> Emilio Aguinaldo took his
oath as President of the Revolutionary Government on March 23, 1897, a day
after the controversial convention at the Casa Hacienda de Tejeros in the
neighboring town of Rosario. </footnote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#62:1>
There 's nothing intrinsically wrong in choosing these topics.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#63:1>
They deserve attention.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#64:1>
But since much material had already been written on these ( at least
locally), it should also serve as a signal that it 's time to focus on other
things.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#65:1>
Aspects like the economy, education, social structures, significant
institutions, demography, folk culture, literature and religion remains
sparsely explored.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#66:1>
Only excursions to these relatively unexplored topics can ensure that
a future <quote> &ldquo; total town history &rdquo; </quote> would not end up
being solely <quote> &ldquo; a political history of a town &rdquo; </quote> (
Austria, 2001: 31-32).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#67:1>
This study hopes to be a modest contribution to this ideal, if only
to prove that Tanza is still interesting, independent of the favor Aguinaldo
bestowed upon its humble convent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#68:1>
The term <mention> <it> popular </it> </mention> in our subject
matter brings to mind the divide between the historically important local
personalities and the &ldquo; significant", faceless <indig> <it> masa </it>
</indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#69:1>
Traditional historiography has always been generous towards the
contribution of homegrown heroes in each town 's saga.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#70:1>
Nobody can deny the importance of these people, especially in a
province where the <mention> <it> Great Men Theory </it> </mention> is still
faithfully adhered to.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#71:1>
One of the classical canons in presenting history to the readers, the
<mention> <it> Great Men Theory </it> </mention> focuses on the exemplary
life and deeds of so-called <mention> <it> heroes </it> </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#72:1>
This preoccupation with great individuals fulfill a two-point
purpose: first, for history to be more attractive and fascinating for the
readers; secondly, the heroism epitomized by these men may inspire people to
imitate them, particularly in the service of the motherland ( Delagoza,
1993:101).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#73:1>
But the ideal of &ldquo; total history &rdquo; certainly demands a
more egalitarian view of a town 's saga.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#74:1>
A Tanza viewed from the top of the social spectrum is definitely an
incomplete picture.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#75:1>
To put some semblance of balance, ways must be done to study the
historical perspective of the unnamed, the masses.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#76:1>
Reynaldo Ileto had long espoused the idea of writing &ldquo;
histories from below".

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#77:1>
He believes that in traditional history, the masses are not allowed
to speak for themselves.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#78:1>
We cannot simply dismiss the masses as submissive and receptive to
the forces coming from the <foreign> <it> pueblo </it> </foreign> center (
Gealogo, 1993:52-53).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#79:1>
It also stressed that the masses were not simply unknowing victims of
the determining forces of history.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#80:1>
Instead, they highlighted the capacity of the peripheral to make
their own history, distinctly apart from that of the politically empowered
and the economically significant. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#81:1>
It is in the cultural front that the proactive power of the
labeled &ldquo; nameless &rdquo; is most evident.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#82:1>
Since this study 's subject matter is a part of popular religious
culture, it may present a different picture of Tanza as a society.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#83:1>
The folk appeal of <indig> <it> Tata Usteng </it> </indig> is
definitely a good text in studying the mentality of Tanza 's historical
consciousness.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#84:1>
This study intends to present a new, periphery-based perspective
through which the town 's history can be viewed. <fnr> <sp> 5 </sp> </fnr>
<footnote> Several studies on Philippine rural history saw local cultural
traditions and their material aspects reflectors of a society 's historical
perspective.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#85:1>
For an excellent treatise using this approach, see Mojares ( 1985).
</footnote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#86:1>
To sum up, this study is of significance to local historiography
for three reasons.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#87:1>
First, it presents a preliminary overview of the development of a
local religious devotion in an organized historical narrative.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#88:1>
Second, it is a contribution to a much wider project, which is the
completion of a comprehensive town history for Tanza.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#89:1>
And third, it seeks to present an alternative perspective of history,
through the eyes of ordinary people, with a religious tradition as locus of
study. </p>

<h> <bold> Review of Related Literature </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#91:1>
Since this work is pioneering in nature, it does not have the
luxury of past serious studies on the subject matter as points of reference.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#92:1>
In fact, researches using rigid documentation and a framework for
analysis are totally non-existent.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#93:1>
Nevertheless, there is one particular manuscript that provided the
researcher the necessary footing needed to go on with the study. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#94:1>
Entitled <mention> <ul> The History and Cultural Life of Tanza,
Cavite </ul> </mention> ( 1953), this unpublished manuscript by Mariano
Montano was the product of the earliest attempt of locals to consolidate oral
testimonies into a formal written history.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#95:1>
Apparently, this work was intended to be part of the Historical Data
Papers ( HDP) of the National Library.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#96:1>
For some reason, this manuscript never reached its destination.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-009#97:1>
There 's absolutely nothing on Tanza to be found in the current HDP
collection. </p> ... </I>
