<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#1:1:A>
Thank you Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#2:1:A>
Mr President we gather here today in search of peace security and
welfare of the Filipino people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#3:1:A>
They elected us to this august Chamber to discharge our
Constitutional duties one of the most important of which is to ratify or
reject treaties or international agreements that have vital influence in
their lives and fortune
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#4:1:A>
Mr President and distinguished colleagues outside this hall are
rallies demonstrations and loud protests of our people holding divergent
views seeking to sway our decision
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#5:1:A>
In a democratic institution like ours we encourage them to do so
because the people must be free to choose their own future without fear or
favor without dictation or domination without suppression or subversion
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#6:1:A>
But guided by our obligation to secure their safety freedom and
progress as Divine Providence gives us to see the light we cast our vote
today in accordance with our conscience unafraid of the indictment of
posterity
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#7:1:A>
Let history be the final judge of our deeds
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#8:1:A>
We are called upon to accept or reject Senate Resolution Number four
four three under Committee Report Number forty-two which declares its
concurrence on the Visiting Forces Agreement between the government of the
Philippines and the government of the United States
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#9:1:A>
It must be pointed out that we have an existing Mutual Defense
Treaty with the United States signed in nineteen fifty-one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#10:1:A>
We could have renounced it after the Senate rejected the proposed
Treaty of Friendship Economic Cooperation and Security with the United States
in nineteen ninety-one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#11:1:A>
But we did not because that was not our intention
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#12:1:A>
Despite the bases pull-out we chose to keep the M D T because the
need to maintain the security alliances with the most powerful nation in the
world must remain
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#13:1:A>
In the present circumstances prudence dictates that we give
substance and effect to the R P - U S Mutual Defense Treaty through the
concurrence of the Senate in the Visiting Forces Agreement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#14:1:A>
The V F A is not crafted to recolonize the Philippines or to
resurrect the foreign bases that we had discarded
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#15:1:A>
Voting for it does not mean a surrender of our sovereignty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#16:1:A>
It simply permits the short troop visits upon approval by our
government for purposes of joint military exercises to ensure our security
relationship under the aforesaid Treaty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#17:1:A>
To ordinary citizens this gey this gathering may have little or no
real impact on their daily struggle for their survival
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#18:1:A>
Yet in the life of our beloved nation today 's event holds
surpassing meaning and unprecedented significance destined to etch in our
country 's history
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#19:1:A>
Mr President distinguished colleagues in the Senate I stand here
today on behalf of seventy million Filipinos whose future depends on the
security of our shores and the sustenance of their livelihood
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#20:1:A>
I come here today to cast my vote a vote that embraces the lesson
of history and takes careful consideration of learned opinions of legal and
political experts on this Agreement requiring our sound judgment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#21:1:A>
We are at a time of relative peace we are not a country at war
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#22:1:A>
But we should not let this lull us into a false sense of security
because the string that holds this peace is weak
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#23:1:A>
For while we are peace-loving people willing to go the extra mile
for peace there are also those willing to go the extra mile to disturb that
peace
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#24:1:A>
The greatest threat to this fragile state of security in fact lies
in slumber only a few hundred nautical miles away from our shores
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#25:1:A>
Mr President today we make another hard and momentous decision for
our people one that seeks to guarantee that peace continue to reign a peace
that is crucial in sustaining our gains as a nation and leading us toward the
next millennium where we can match <?> stride </?> with most prosperous
economies and countries of the world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#26:1:A>
Deciding the fate of the Visiting Forces Agreement I believe is a
choice between preserving that peace or treading the path toward a future of
uncertainty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#27:1:A>
People say that our decision today would either set us back to the
time when we were ruled by foreign colonizers or affirm the independence we
have achieved when the last warship in Subic Bay the helicopter carrier <?> 
Bella Wood </?> sailed out of Philippine waters
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#28:1:A>
It is the obligation of the Senate according to the critics of the
V F A to preserve the gains we have achieved in nineteen ninety-one when we
threw the military bases out of the country and finally ended the last form
of foreign domination in our country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#29:1:A>
Mr President I am all for keeping and fighting for independence and
sovereignty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#30:1:A>
A brief look of history would show that my family had been deeply
involved in the elusive quest for freedom from foreign rule
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#31:1:A>
My grandfather fought the Americans during the Philippine war for
independence the centennial of which we are celebrating this year
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#32:1:A>
My father was a delegate during the passage of the
Hare-Hawes-Cutting Law and the Tydings-McDuffie Law which paved the way for
Philippine Independence from the United States
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#33:1:A>
My brother Ninoy who was erroneously tagged as an Amboy by his
detractors maintained his position for Philippine sovereignty although the
 <.> U </.> the United States provided him refuge from the dictator
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#34:1:A>
Another brother Butz as a Senator cast his vote against the
continued stay of the U S bases in nineteen ninety-one despite the pro-bases
stand taken by our sister-in-law the former President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#35:1:A>
Now it is my turn to make a choice
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#36:1:A>
Mr President every generation must write a new kind of history
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#37:1:A>
Times have changed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#38:1:A>
Today 's challenges are different
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#39:1:A>
They are of a broader kind
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#40:1:A>
They are of a global nature
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#41:1:A>
The choice I am about to make and the circumstances that surround
it differ from those on which the members of my family based their option
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#42:1:A>
But we are one in principle
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#43:1:A>
We are entering a new millennium when there is a great economic
competition fueled by the dizzying pace of technological advances
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#44:1:A>
But with progress comes more threats to our national security
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#45:1:A>
These threats have to be confronted now not with a narrow
nationalism but with a broader perspective of cooperation and mutual support
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#46:1:A>
This is where alliances treaties and agreements like the V F A will
come in
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#47:1:A>
But before we talk about what the V F A can do for us it is
necessary first to discuss what it cannot do
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#48:1:A>
The V F A alone cannot provide us military dominance the V F A
alone cannot bring us economic progress and more importantly the V F A alone
cannot prevent any foreign act of aggression
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#49:1:A>
Regional security will largely depend on the number of bilateral
alliances and agreements
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#50:1:A>
The U S presence in the Asia Pacific is anchored on treaties and
security agreements with countries like the Philippines Thailand Singapore
Indonesia Malaysia and Brunei with similar arrangement on the status of
forces
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#51:1:A>
One thing is certain Mr President we need friends we need allies
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#52:1:A>
With friends and allies we can collectively guarantee our regional
security and stability
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#53:1:A>
Not many will agree with the idea of a superpower like the United
States extending its reaches in our region
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#54:1:A>
I am one of those who believe that our security as a nation our
sovereignty should be defended and upheld by the Filipino people neither
through the might of a superpower nor the cover of a military alliance
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#55:1:A>
Mr President I realize that we are fifteen years and several
billions of pesos away from becoming truly able to defend our borders and
protect our people from external aggression
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#56:1:A>
We lack the time and resources to assure our people that we can
uphold our sovereignty in the complex environment that exists today
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#57:1:A>
And it is our responsibility to make sure that our people be
provided the means to make to have a secure future
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#58:1:A>
That is why I have opened my mind to forging military alliances
with the United States
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#59:1:A>
It is in the larger context of peace that we have to ratify this
Agreement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#60:1:A>
The R P - U S Mutual Defense Treaty is an <.> ef </.> is an
effective deterrent against ambitious neighboring countries
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#61:1:A>
Every potential aggressor is put on notice that any aggression
against the Philippines may result in armed confrontation with the United
States
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#62:1:A>
Our respective forces Armed Forces should be given the opportunity
to train together so that there should <&> should be <mention> should there
 </mention> </&> be exigencies they can effectively work together as one
fighting unit
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#63:1:A>
That is what the V F A seeks to accomplish
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#64:1:A>
We share with the Americans a passion for democracy and human
rights
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#65:1:A>
We fought side by side with them when our freedom was threatened
during World War two
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#66:1:A>
The Senate has put in place enough safeguards that would allay
fears and abuses are bound to take place
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#67:1:A>
One of which is the creation of Legislative Oversight Committee
that would monitor and oversee this its implementation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#68:1:A>
We have fo poured our undivided attention and spent urgent critical
deliberation on the V F A
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#69:1:A>
Two years were spent by the government of the Philippines and the
government of the United States in negotiating the V F A
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#70:1:A>
Let us give the Agreement a chance and let us give the Filipino
people a rare opportunity to pre to prove their capability to uphold this
treaty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#71:1:A>
While the Agreement took such a long time to study and prepare we
also recognize that the V F A is not permanent
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#72:1:A>
When we are ready we can do away with it and when that time comes I
will be one of those cheering at this great achievement of our people of
taking complete control of our security
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#73:1:A>
Fears have been raised Mr President over the possible resurgence of
prostitution rings with the ratification of the V F A
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#74:1:A>
Nothing ranks higher in my consideration of the V F A that may <&> 
should be <mention> than my </mention> </&> concern for the fate of the women
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#75:1:A>
When we rejected the U S Bases Treaty in nineteen ninety-one it was
a rejection of the commodification of our women in Angeles and Olongapo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#76:1:A>
Ratifying the V F A does not mean that we are allowing our women to
be exposed against the same humiliating <.> vi </.> vices
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#77:1:A>
I say ratify the V F A and pass Senate Bill Number fifteen
sixty-two or the Anti- Prostitution Act
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#78:1:A>
That proposed measure would decriminalize the prostitute and would
penalize the reason for the crime the pimp and the buyer
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#79:1:A>
Pass this bill into law and enforce so whoever engages the services
of prostitutes be they Filipino American or any other nationality will be
prosecuted and charged accordingly
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#80:1:A>
Rejecting the V F A will not solve our country 's problem on
prostitution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#81:1:A>
Whether the V F A is here or not we will we still have to work very
hard to provide a solution to this moral and social problem
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#82:1:A>
Mr President and my dear colleagues I would like to make an appeal
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#83:1:A>
A rejection of the V F A would not give the country the respect it
wants from other independent nations
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#84:1:A>
Rejecting the V F A would be an act of cowardice and fear a fear of
the past and a fear of the unknown
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#85:1:A>
Rejection would be a silent admission that we are still unable to
stand on equal footing with other independent countries such as the United
States
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#86:1:A>
Mr President the time has come to show to the whole world that we
can hold our own in the community of nations
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#87:1:A>
Now is the time to prove that we can see eye to eye with other
countries match them stride for stride
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#88:1:A>
We determine our own destiny we can only be dominated if we choose
to be dominated
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#89:1:A>
In nineteen eighty-six we as a people rose against the domination
of an oppressive government and despotic ruler
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#90:1:A>
In nineteen ninety-one we again as a people decided against the
continued stay of the U S bases in the country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#91:1:A>
In nineteen ninety-six we collectively rallied against any form of
Charter change that would bring the country back to the throes of dictatorial
rule
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#92:1:A>
And only last year through our votes we reaffirmed our commitment
to democracy and put in place a government truly representative of the people 's
will a government which truly is our own
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#93:1:A>
In closing Mr President the V F A will not eliminate conflicts it
will not put an end to war it will not secure freedom for all
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#94:1:A>
But I cast my vote in favor of Senate Resolution four four three
concurring in the Agreement between the governments of the Philippines and
the United States regarding the treatment of U S Armed Forces visiting the
Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#95:1:A>
I cast my vote in favor of V F A because it will help preserve
peace
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#96:1:A>
And the peace that we seek does not rest in treaties and agreements
or charters and covenants alone
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#97:1:A>
It is the peace that lies also in the hearts and minds of the
Filipino people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#98:1:A>
Let us therefore ask them to fully support and totally commit to
preserve our peace and freedom to assure a stable and bright future
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#99:1:A>
<indig> Mabuhay ang Pilipinas </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-034#100:1:A>
Thank you Mr President </I> 1
