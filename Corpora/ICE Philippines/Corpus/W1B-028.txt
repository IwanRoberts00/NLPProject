MEMORANDUM

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#5:1>
TO: ALL DLSU Budgetary Units

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#6:1>
FR: The Finance Director

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#7:1>
RE: 1999-2000 Budget

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#8:1>
We are now ready to start the budgetary process for schoolyear
1999-2000, and I would like to ask again your kind cooperation in projecting
your operating and capital needs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#9:1>
Our Board of Trustees had suggested during the last board meeting
that we do zero base budgeting to improve our planning and budgetary process.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#10:1>
However, we feel we are not ready at this time to start from zero.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#11:1>
Instead, we are requesting all budgetary unit heads to review,
analyze and reevaluate each item in their budgets and project these items
based on their future needs and at the same time keeping within the limits of
available resources.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#12:1>
Please evaluate your current activities together with your new
programs, if any.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#13:1>
Then you can establish your priorities and identify tradeoffs between
your expenditure levels and operating needs.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#14:1>
New activities can be ranked higher than current ones and, thus, new
programs can be funded with existing funding levels. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#15:1>
For schoolyear 1999-2000, your budget for operating expenses (
excluding salaries and benefits) and capital expenditures may be increased by
7%.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#16:1>
You are at liberty to distribute the funds in any manner you deem
best for your unit provided you do not exceed the limit.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#17:1>
Attached to this memo are some guidelines to help you in the
preparation of your budget.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#18:1>
Please pay particular attention to no. 6 in the guidelines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#19:1>
We are requesting all budgetary units to submit their proposed
budgets using the attached budget forms properly <bold> totaled </bold> ,
within the approved limits to the <it> Finance Director, Accounting Office
</it> on or before <it> February 15, 1999 </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#20:1>
All budgetary requests exceeding the approved limits should be
submitted on the same date to the office of the Executive Vice-President,
copy furnished the Vice-President for Academics for budgetary requests from
academic units. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#21:1>
Thank you. </p>

The Board of Directors

<@> Magnificence Tower </@>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#29:2>
Gentlemen:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#30:2>
With reference to your letter dated September 1, 2001 increasing
the association dues from &peso;40.00/sq.m. to &peso;59.94/sq.m, we are
raising the following points:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#31:2>
1. Please let us know how the total area of 6,770.98 sq.m. was
computed.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#32:2>
In our simple computation, the total area of the 12 units per floor
is 330.98 sq.m. and granting that there are 23 floors, the total area should
be 7,612.54 sq.m.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#33:2>
This does not even take into account the fact that the first two
floors should have a bigger area and, also, the floors being used as your own
residence undoubtedly have a bigger area. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#34:2>
2. We are shocked that your estimated monthly electric bill of
&peso;53,000 would now increase by more than 200% to &peso;183,000 as per
your revised estimate dated September 1.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#35:2>
We would like to know what electrical equipment, machinery, and
lighting fixtures are being serviced by Meralco meter no. xxxxxx. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#36:2>
3. We are also shocked that your estimated monthly water bill of
&peso;4,000 would now increase by 200% to &peso;12,000 as per your revised
estimate dated September 1, considering that there has been no increase in
the common areas.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#37:2>
We would like to receive documentation supporting this proposed
increase. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#38:2>
4. We would also like to request a listing of office
equipment/furniture/fixtures amounting to &peso;60,000 supported by invoices.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#39:2>
5. We would like to reiterate our request for a listing of the
units sold per floor and their respective owners. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#40:2>
6. We would also like to inform you that we intend to exercise
our right under the Corporation Code to inspect the books of the condominium
corporation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#41:2>
We will withhold payment until after all these concerns have been
addressed to our full satisfaction. </p>

Dear Engr. <@> Colina </@> :

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#51:3>
Greetings for a happy 2002 to you. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#52:3>
As you know, we have questions about the computation of the
Association dues.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#53:3>
Although we have been exchanging several letters, the issues remain
unresolved.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#54:3>
The undersigned therefore wish to ask for a meeting with the Board of
Directors to discuss our concerns.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#55:3>
May we request you to set up a meeting this coming Wednesday (
January 9) or Friday ( January 11), at 2 p.m., at <@> Magnificence Tower </@> .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#56:3>
We hope to hear from you soon.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#57:3>
Thank you very much. </p>

Dear Engr. <@> Colina </@> :

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#67:4>
Thank you for your letter of January 9. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#68:4>
We hope that your books will reveal the information as to why we
are being assessed &peso;59.94 per square meter, from the original assessment
of &peso;40.00.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#69:4>
Attached is our letter of September 18, 2001; please note that
Questions 1, 2, and 3 have not been answered. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#70:4>
Although Mrs.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#71:4>
<@> Canlas </@> wrote us a letter on October 2 itemizing replies to
1, 2, 3, and 5, the points she makes ( complete with insults) really do not
answer Questions 1, 2, and 3. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#72:4>
For Question 1, she gives receipts for association dues for the
units/floors owned by <@> Canlas Properties </@> , but what we want to know
is very simple - the area for each floor and the total for the 22 floors, to
explain the discrepancy between your computation of 6,770.98 sq.m. versus our
computation of 7,283.32 sq.m. ( 331.06 sq.m./floor x 22 floors). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#73:4>
For Question 2, Mrs. <@> Canlas </@> said: <quote> &ldquo; You
were asking what machineries, <foreign> etc. </foreign> were tapped with
Meralco meter No. xxxxxxx, I think it 's a waste of time answering this since
you do not trust us. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#74:4>
This does not answer our question.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#75:4>
We are willing to trust Mrs. <@> Canlas </@> , a Board member at
that, but she must give us a reason to trust her.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#76:4>
Instead, she heaps insults on us, in effect saying <quote> <indig>
hindi kami sanay tumira sa condo o village, wala kaming matinong isip, wala
kaming common sense at fair judgment. </indig> </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#77:4>
The question is simple: With all due respect, may we know what
equipment, machinery, fixtures are serviced by this particular Meralco meter.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#78:4>
For Question 3, we have studied Annex 16, but without any
explanation from Mrs. <@> Canlas </@> or you, we cannot see the connection
between our inquiry and that particular receipt from Maynilad Water.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#79:4>
It is questions like these that we would have wanted to discuss in
the meeting that we were requesting with the Board. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#80:4>
For your information, we have taken the trouble of making a
survey of the condominium units around De La Salle University.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#81:4>
We have found out that the association dues being charged by <@>
Florentino Tower </@> and <@> Topaz Balconies </@> are much lower than the
dues that you are assessing - and they offer much better amenities.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#82:4>
We have learned that <@> Florentino Tower </@> , which has a big
lobby, a beautiful swimming pool, a gym, a function room, and three
elevators, charges &peso;42.00 per square meter, while <@> Topaz Balconies
</@> , also with a lobby, a swimming pool, a gym, a game room, a function
room, and three elevators, charges &peso;35.00 per square meter.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#83:4>
Notice that your <it> original </it> assessment of &peso;40.00 per
square meter is completely in line with what those two condominium buildings
are charging. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#84:4>
For this reason, we really would like answers to our questions so
that we can see the justification for the increase of almost 50% in the
association dues starting October 2001.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#85:4>
Since Mrs. <@> Canlas </@> has been expressing her anger at us ( both
in letters and in person), we might as well also mention our frustration with
the <@> Canlases </@> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#86:4>
May we remind you that per contract to sell, you were supposed to
deliver the units to us in October 1998, but - understanding the economic
realities of the times - we patiently waited until the units were given to us
in May 2001.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#87:4>
Now that we are withholding the payment of the balance between the
original assessment and the revised assessment of our association dues until
our objections are answered, you are slapping a 4% monthly interest on the
balance.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#88:4>
When you were selling the units to us, your brochure promised an
attractive lobby, parquet floors, and wooden base; notice that we did not
press the issue when these were not given to us.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#89:4>
We wanted to have a member on the Board so that all transactions
could be explained to the minority credibly and so that we could have a voice
on the Board, but that role in the Corporation was denied us; we accepted
that defeat graciously. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#90:4>
In short, we are willing to meet the <@> Canlases </@> halfway if
they are willing to do the same.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#91:4>
Mrs. <@> Canlas </@> says, <quote> &ldquo; We are here as a family,
so we have to contribute. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#92:4>
You know that we are willing to contribute, and we have been doing so
faithfully since the very beginning, in 1996, when we started paying for our
units, but give us a solid justification before asking us to increase our
contribution.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#93:4>
And treat us like family, not as your enemies.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#94:4>
We too have a stake in <@> Magnificence Tower </@> Condominium
Corporation. </p>

<bold> RE: <h> GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS </h> </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#102:5>
Each term, our office handles cases involving graduating
students who are not aware of requirements that they have to fulfill in order
to graduate.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#103:5>
A great number of these students are those who claim to be deeply
engrossed with their theses such that they miss out on important
announcements.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#104:5>
In line with this, may I request you to please help our office in
disseminating information regarding graduation requirements. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#105:5>
All graduating students on their final term should apply for
evaluation of records with the College Records In-Charge at the Registrar 's
Office.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#106:5>
This term, application forms for evaluation will be available from
<bold> February 8 </bold> to <bold> March 12, 1999 </bold> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#107:5>
After the student 's records have been evaluated, they will need
to secure a copy of the <bold> Letter-of-Intent to Graduate </bold> from <it>
Window 4 ( Office of the University Registrar) </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#108:5>
<bold> LOI </bold> Forms will be available starting <bold> February
22, 1999 </bold> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#109:5>
The accomplished form should be submitted to the same Window on or
before <bold> April 8, 1999 </bold> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#110:5>
Please help us emphasize the importance of these requirements.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#111:5>
<bold> THE STUDENTS <ul> NEED NOT BE </ul> ABSOLUTELY SURE OF
PASSING THEIR REMAINING SUBJECTS BEFORE FULFILLING THEM. </bold> </p>

Re: <h> Faculty Outing </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#117:6>
This is to inform you that the Special Projects and Campus
Affairs Committee under the chairmanship of Mrs. Evangeline Andaya is
presently making arrangements for our faculty outing at the end of the
current school year.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#118:6>
The faculty outing is going to be a 3-day and 2-night affair to be
held on April 16-18 in Baguio City with accommodations at the Teacher 's
Camp.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#119:6>
While there, faculty members will have free time to visit places of
interest to them on their own expense but there are planned common activities
which are the following:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#120:6>
Morning fun run at Track Oval

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#121:6>
Night 1 - Bonfire

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#122:6>
Night 2 - Disco

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#123:6>
Workshop on Future Thrusts and Directions of the Faculty Association
( to be held either in the afternoon of the 1st day or morning of the 2nd
day). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#124:6>
You may notice that this is the first time that we are holding a
serious activity like the last one mentioned above during our annual faculty
outing.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#125:6>
We are doing this now in response to questions raised by
representatives of the Board of Trustees during two meetings of the Council
of Representatives about what activities our organization is doing other than
social activities and advocacy work for improvement of benefits and working
conditions.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#126:6>
It is also a way of addressing the questions communicated to us by a
concerned DLSUFA member about how ideas of the general membership of the FA
may be tapped in the making of major decisions for our organization.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#127:6>
Hence, the workshop which will take only a small portion of our stay
in Baguio City may be participated in by those among us who have ideas to
share or who are concerned enough with the affairs of the organization to
wish to be counted in charting the future directions of our organization.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#128:6>
For the purpose of making arrangements for accommodation,
transportation and funding, could you please fill up the survey form below
and return it to the FA Office on or before Thursday, March 4? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-028#129:6>
Thank you for your cooperation on this matter. </p> </I>
