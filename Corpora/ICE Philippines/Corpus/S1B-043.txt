<I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#1:1:A>
<O> music </O> Her family own a printing press
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#2:1:A>
Her mother is a regular lecturer on export
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#3:1:A>
And of course her father used to be the Minister of Trade and Industry and now Governor of Camarines Sur
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#4:1:A>
This lady is a graduate of the business administration course in U P
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#5:1:A>
What can you expect <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#6:1:A>
Well she says it was a product of all of these ingredients
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#7:1:A>
And so today Marita Villafuerte <,> uh agreed to have us look at her studio and of course the factory where she 's doing her thing
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#8:1:A>
She 's now into stationery and greeting cards
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#9:1:A>
So here we are at Marita 's uh <,> little place here
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#10:1:A>
It 's so exciting
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#11:1:A>
It 's such a cozy studio
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#12:1:A>
And uh Marita first of all welcome to our show <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#13:1:B>
Thank you for inviting me
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#14:1:B>
It 's a pleasure to be here in your show

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#15:1:A>
And well you know that stationery is a very major ingredient in any store around the world any store
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#16:1:A>
It is one of the items one of the top ten items that stores around the world stock up <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#17:1:A>
And uh I 'm very very happy that you are in this field
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#18:1:A>
And uh of course from the work that you 're doing we can see that there 's a lot of influences from the area where you come from

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#19:1:B>
From Bicol

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#20:1:A>
Yes <,> uh probably you can tell our <,> viewers what exactly inspired you to use a lot of these materials

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#21:1:B>
Actually since we own a printing publishing firm ever since I worked for them in college I 've been uh printing greeting cards and stationeries which I market locally
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#22:1:B>
So at the moment I 'm supplying fifty bookstores
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#23:1:B>
But uh since my Mom is a regular lecturer in export and I see a lot of her clients coming here consulting her about export and you know she has this export fever actually it 's her it 's her ambition for all her children to go into export
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#24:1:B>
So she was the one who encouraged me to venture into this business
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#25:1:B>
And uh I know that our province my Dad being Governor of Camarines Sur I saw a lot of uh raw materials that has a lot of potentials
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#26:1:B>
Because <,> the province of Camarines Sur is well endowed with a lot of resources like especially the <indig> abaca </indig> and uh bark and uh the the materials which I use for the handy paper which is <indig> cogon </indig> grass and uh so many things so many exotic indigenous materials <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#27:1:B>
So <,> I decided to venture into making <,> handcrafted greeting cards with uh something Filipino in it using Filipino materials

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#28:1:A>
You actually don't have a fine arts uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#29:1:B>
I don't have <{> <[> any </[> background

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#30:1:A>
<[> Background </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#31:1:A>
No background at all <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#32:1:A>
So how does these designs <,> you know get to to be developed

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#33:1:B>
Actually I feel like a pseudo-artist because <,> I 'm a designer because of force of circumstance

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#34:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#35:1:B>
But uh I just imagine I have a very imaginative mind so I didn't really believe that I could do it but my Mom was the one who encouraged me she said I could do it so anything anything under the sun is a <,> stimulus already to me stimuli really

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#36:1:A>
Uh-huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#37:1:B>
So I think I have this card mentality
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#38:1:B>
Anything I see I try to adjust it in a what I can make out of it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#39:1:A>
Uh-huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#40:1:B>
So a card or a wrapper or a stationery

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#41:1:A>
I see and now uh one of the things that I think was very interesting in what you 're doing is that you have started to put uh music

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#42:1:B>
Yes <O> music </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#43:1:B>
This is locally available uh the electronic components are made here in the Philippines

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#44:1:A>
Uh uhm and uh you don't have any problem at all uh incorporating them in all of your designs

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#45:1:B>
Uh <,> the very first time I did because I didn't know how to install it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#46:1:B>
And you know I didn't know the technical aspect

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#47:1:A>
Uh-huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#48:1:B>
But when I consulted the one installing the music I had to adjust some of my designs

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#49:1:A>
I see

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#50:1:B>
So I can fit the music

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#51:1:A>
I I see so the those things you have already uh <,> somehow <,> gone over the <{> <[> hump </[> of those problems

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#52:1:B>
<[> Yes </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#53:1:A>
Uh I notice also Marita that you not only do greeting cards and uh <,> you 've also ventured into stationery items

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#54:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#55:1:A>
Like the all-purpose uh <,> <{1> <[1> cards </[1> and uh slowly you 're getting into wrapping <{2> <[2> gift wrapping </[2> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#56:1:B>
<[1> Cards </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#57:1:B>
<[2> Uh-huh wrapping paper </[2> </{2> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#58:1:A>
Uh-huh
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#59:1:A>
So can you tell us more about that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#60:1:B>
Well actually since I 've been uh actually these designs that I have which I recently <,> uh shipped to Australia <,> these designs I I actually sell locally <,> but uh the Australian buyer asked me what else do I do so I just showed the wrappers and all the stationeries that I do and she told she asked me to design for her
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#61:1:B>
So I made some new designs for her and I made some wrappers for her because it 's the in thing actually

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#62:1:A>
Uh-huh uh-huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#63:1:B>
There 's a big demand for cards wrappers and stationeries

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#64:1:A>
Yes well many of the materials that you have here now are really <,> indigenous to uh the Philippines

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#65:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#66:1:A>
Uh you 're also using handmade paper and uh the other one is pine <indig> 'no </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#67:1:B>
Yes pine corrugated board
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#68:1:B>
It 's recycled paper actually

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#69:1:A>
Uh really <indig> ha </indig> and uh is this recycled paper already readily available also or someone else is doing it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#70:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#71:1:A>
Oh that 's nice
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#72:1:A>
So uh <,> when you are actually thinking

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#73:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#74:1:A>
Of some of the designs <,> somehow how how do you <,> get this to to finally get into uh production

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#75:1:B>
Actually I start with a concept <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#76:1:B>
I think of the occasion and then I start uh I start thinking of ideas and then I let it incubate in my mind
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#77:1:B>
'cause sometimes there are there are designs which took days or weeks some months
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#78:1:B>
But there are some designs that I already have the concept I just sit down I play with the materials and all of a sudden there 's the design already
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#79:1:B>
So it really depends but all the while I just keep my eyes open and look for stimulus

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#80:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#81:1:B>
From anything anything actually from fabric or <,> anything actually anything under the sun <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#82:1:A>
So how about your the people helping you you know the workers

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#83:1:B>
Well uh since this is a family business the printing I mean some of the workers knew me since I was still a kid <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#84:1:B>
Actually they never realized that one of these days I 'll be the one I 'll be the one managing the press
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#85:1:B>
But ever since I took over the company two years ago I started <.> recu </.> recruiting young people

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#86:1:A>
Uh-huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#87:1:B>
Because uh I have uh easier <,> easier time dealing with them because I 'm also young

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#88:1:A>
Uh-huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#89:1:B>
But the old people I retain them because they 've been loyal to our company they 've been here for about fourteen years already

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#90:1:A>
There 's nothing that is wasted in this place you know Marita actually uses all the tiny little bits of <,> pieces and you know and uh swatches and uh whatever she can get hold of to make into things
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#91:1:A>
And uh you can almost see a whole line of wreath done in three dimensional

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#92:1:B>
This is one of my collections
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#93:1:B>
It 's called <mention> the wreath collection </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#94:1:B>
It 's actually one of the favorite and most saleable and marketable probably because of the <,> season because Christmas is the most favorite season I suppose <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#95:1:B>
So uhm the wreaths are made of different materials
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#96:1:B>
The paper again I use uh some for some are made of handmade paper and some are corrugated corrugated boards because I 'm marketing or selling this to different kinds of countries and uh these countries have different tastes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#97:1:B>
Usually the Europeans and the Australians they prefer the natural which is the fine corrugated board
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#98:1:B>
And the Asians they love the pastel colors of the handmade paper
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#99:1:B>
Some some wreaths wreaths are made of garlands <,> some are made of <indig> abaca </indig> twine <,> some have stockings <,> some are made of uh <,> beads <,> so <,> I consider this collection as east meets west because <,> they look native but I injected some uh western <,> styles and I put also some high-tech elements like the electronic music with lights
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#100:1:B>
Like this one <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#101:1:B>
This is one of the designs that I uh shipped to Oman that 's in Middle East <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#102:1:B>
This one is also one of the favorites the pearls
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#103:1:B>
It 's something different
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#104:1:B>
It 's uh not the traditional green and red Christmas <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#105:1:B>
It 's a wreath made of white lavender and pink
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#106:1:B>
Lavender is actually my favorite color and I 'm I 'm happy that when I participated in CITEM this is one of the favorites
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#107:1:B>
In fact all the eight countries that I shipped to they ordered this

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#108:1:A>
I know there are several women who regularly watches the show and always look for something that they could do and probably in their spare time they could also do this as a hobby
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#109:1:A>
Marita how long has this been going on

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#110:1:B>
The export <{> <[> business </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#111:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#112:1:B>
I started actually just last year

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#113:1:A>
Last year

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#114:1:B>
And my d&eacute;but was when I joined the CITEM
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#115:1:B>
The <mention> Thirteenth Market Week </mention> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#116:1:A>
Uh uhm and uh since then you 've received buyers from

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#117:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#118:1:A>
From other countries

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#119:1:B>
Uh uhm
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#120:1:B>
I 've had uh the most important thing for me even though I 'm starting very modestly is that I 've had the opportunity to enter the market in eight countries

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#121:1:A>
Eight countries right away

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#122:1:B>
Eight countries

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#123:1:A>
Oh that 's good

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#124:1:B>
And at the moment I 'm already corresponding and answering some inquiries from other <,> prospective buyers

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#125:1:A>
Uh uhm
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#126:1:A>
And what is the most saleable uh <,> item that you have right now

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#127:1:B>
The most saleable I have is the wreath collection and also the twine collection
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#128:1:B>
This uh weaving

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#129:1:A>
Uh-huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#130:1:B>
<{> <[> So we do some weaving </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#131:1:A>
<[> And now </[> </{> which countries uh particularly like this

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#132:1:B>
Usually the Asians and the Australians
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#133:1:B>
May maybe because it 's very simple
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#134:1:B>
They find beauty in it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#135:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#136:1:B>
So they like it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#137:1:A>
But of course Marita is not only in stationery <,> uh Marita is also in puppetry <O> laughter </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#138:1:B>
Uhm that 's true

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#139:1:A>
So we have asked her to to give us a sample
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#140:1:A>
She 's a member of what what 's the puppetry

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#141:1:B>
Uh I 'm <,> a member of Puppeteers Association of the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#142:1:B>
It 's a two-year old non-stock non-profit organization

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#143:1:A>
Uh uhm and you have members all over the country

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#144:1:B>
Yes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#145:1:B>
We 're composed of different active puppet groups and uh <,> the members are classified from professional to hobbyists to students educators
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#146:1:B>
I 'm one of the hobbyists actually <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#147:1:B>
Anyone interested in puppetry can call us at eight three three zero seven seven eight
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#148:1:B>
They can look for me <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#149:1:B>
If they 're interested to learn the art of puppetry we conduct regular puppet workshop

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#150:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#151:1:B>
So we teach children
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#152:1:B>
We teach teachers educators and professionals

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#153:1:A>
When does this happen

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#154:1:B>
Monthly actually
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#155:1:B>
We schedule it and it 's also upon invitation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#156:1:B>
So we also go on provincial tour
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#157:1:B>
<X> Hello
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#158:1:B>
How are you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#159:1:B>
Hi Mom
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#160:1:B>
It 's my first time on T V
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#161:1:B>
Yey I 'd like to greet all my puppet friends from Puppeteers Association of the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#162:1:B>
How are you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#163:1:B>
I hope you can see me on T V right now <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#164:1:B>
And I 'd like to thank <,> <indig> Tita </indig> Violy for my clothes and Sam for my make-up
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#165:1:B>
<indig> Ay nagkabaliktad 'ata 'yon ah </indig> </X> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#166:1:A>
One of the items I uh that caught my fancy was that packaging item that you were doing

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#167:1:B>
Okay

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#168:1:A>
So Marita can you tell me something about what <,> your plans are in this area

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#169:1:B>
I have about three kinds of packaging <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#170:1:B>
The first is the traditional this is the envelope and then uh I have another kind of envelope which is expandable because some of my products are two-dimensional or three-dimensional so it 's protruding
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#171:1:B>
So I use expandable envelopes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#172:1:B>
And another thing is this one <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#173:1:B>
This is the new kind of <.> pack </.> packaging that I make <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#174:1:B>
It 's almost like a gift <,> because I believe especially in Europe and in Australia the U S and Canada they uh they <,> value the cards that they receive
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#175:1:B>
They keep it and they display it during Christmas and other special occasions <&> commercial break </&> <O> music </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#176:1:A>
What is in a name
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#177:1:A>
The first time we heard about the company called <mention> Abstraction </mention> you know we were saying what is it about this company that made them use the word <mention> abstraction </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-043#178:1:A>
And now that we are here we understand why they chose this name


 </I>
