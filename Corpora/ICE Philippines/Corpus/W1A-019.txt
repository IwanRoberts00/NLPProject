<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#X2:1>
1. Obligatory Question: Explain/interpret the following statement
and give concrete examples from an academic setting: <quote> &ldquo; The
classroom...is not simply a neutral channel for the passage of information
from teacher to learner.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#X3:1>
It is a dynamic, interactive environment which affects the nature
both of what is taught and what is learnt.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#X4:1>
The classroom thus generates its own syllabus. &rdquo; </quote> </p>
</X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#5:1>
At a time when learners are considered <foreign> TABULA RASA
</foreign> , the teacher 's role is that of a <foreign> MAESTRA/MAESTRO
</foreign> - the sole source of knowledge that learners are expected to
absorb.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#6:1>
There was little room for interaction and questions were addressed
because they are means of knowing, understanding, and clarifying, not because
they are signs that the learners are thinking and generating ideas.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#7:1>
Communication, being restricted to this type, was between teacher and
student, hardly between and among peers.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#8:1>
As views on the nature of language and language teaching evolved, so
did the roles played by teachers and learners.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#9:1>
The classroom became learning and learner-centered and teaching became
more flexible, that is, adjustments and modifications are made to suit
learners ' needs and learning style.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#10:1>
The syllabus stands as a representation of the end goals set within
the curriculum, the attainment of which varies according to the dynamics
displayed by the learners.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#11:1>
In a class, for instance, that best performs when competition is
involved, games may be utilized more than socialized recitation as a tool for
learning. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#12:1>
Teachers also learn to take a cue from students.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#13:1>
In my research writing class, this is best illustrated by an activity
I adopted as an aid to teaching students how to paraphrase.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#14:1>
Having cited the importance of presenting the ideas of other writers
in one 's own words, we proceeded to the quite predictable task of
paraphrasing 2-3 passages, which the students hardly appreciated, judging by
the grunts and groans I hear in the duration of the activity - which stands
in stark contrast to the enthusiasm they show when there are group tasks.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#15:1>
Consequently, the result showed a prevalence of literal paraphrasing,
hardly reflective of any appreciation for paraphrasing as a useful
reader-writer tool.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#16:1>
Obviously, we had to go through another round - and perhaps more,
until the result becomes satisfactory, that is, until they realize that
paraphrasing is not synonymous to substituting words and phrases. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#17:1>
So the meeting after that, in order to elicit the same level of
excitement they show in activities that involve friendly competition, I
devised a game that will earn them points for every correct answer and added
incentive to the first five that finishes ahead.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#18:1>
In groups of 3, they were tasked to find the popular quote or rhyme
that corresponds to each of 10 sentences that make use of uncommon terms,
usually high-faluting words.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#19:1>
One example is <quote> &ldquo; scintillate, scintillate, miniscule
asteroid &rdquo; </quote> which translates into <quote> &ldquo; Twinkle,
twinkle, little star. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#20:1>
Another is <quote> &ldquo; Vapors & fumes appear where conflagration
exists &rdquo; </quote> which is simply said as <quote> &ldquo; Where there 's
smoke, there 's fire. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#21:1>
Although the items proved to be difficult, the students claimed they
enjoyed it and it made them understand that as research writers, they make
use of the skill of paraphrasing to aid comprehension & to say things in
simple words, not to impress their teacher with their use of &ldquo; BIG
&rdquo; words that are almost always misused. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#22:1>
By adjusting to learners ' needs, interest, & style, the
classroom, as illustrated in the preceding account, becomes a place for
AUTHENTIC learning that follows a two-way traffic. </p> <X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#X23:1>
2. Language experts argue that reading and writing are <quote>
&ldquo; two sides of the same coin. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#X24:1>
a. Explain what the argument means.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#X25:1>
b. Discuss the pedagogical implications of the argument. </p> </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#26:1>
Of the four MACRO SKILLS, reading & writing are associated with
receptive & productive skills, respectively.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#27:1>
The reading-writing connection has seen a lot of changes, however,
and the view that both reading & writing are interactive processes is now
widely considered.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#28:1>
This paradigm, as represented by the model below <O> drawing of
circles with captions </O> stresses that reading goes beyond bottom-up &
top-down processing and writing ceases to be product-oriented.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#29:1>
Connecting the two macro skills is THINKING which signifies that
interaction is present when one reads a text because he/she engages in a more
complex socio-cognitive process which is manifested in the strategies he/she
employs in comprehending the text, the prediction he/she makes, the judgment
he/she passes, the questions he/she raises, the schema he/she activates,
<foreign> etc. </foreign>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#30:1>
Likewise, THINKING is evident in writing, this, too, being a complex
socio-cognitive process whose goal is to communicate the writers ' thought to
the readers, who in turn, interacts with the writers by responding to the
text in such ways as those enumerated above.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#31:1>
The terms <mention> INTERACTIVE </mention> & <mention> RECURSIVE
</mention> have taken center stage, relegating to the background terms like
<mention> MECHANICAL </mention> & <mention> ISOLATED </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#32:1>
The language teacher adjusts as well, giving more importance to
PROCESS than PRODUCT, allowing room for changes & revisions, treating errors
as opportunities for learning rather than reflections of inadequacy.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#33:1>
Hence, although reading & writing are two distinct skills, they share
the view that THINKING is an ongoing process that is activated by the onset
of reading and/or writing BUT NOT TERMINATED at the same time the reading or
writing stops.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#34:1>
In that sense, they are <quote> &ldquo; two sides of the same coin
&rdquo; </quote> & should be regarded as such in the language classroom. </p>
<X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#X35:1>
3. The last three decades have seen the development of writing
instruction as a separate discipline.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#X36:1>
Theories of writing instruction have emerged and influenced
classroom teaching.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#X37:1>
a. Discuss the current status of writing instruction in the
Philippines within the context of the theories that have developed in the
last few decades.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#X38:1>
b. State which of these theories have primarily influenced your
teaching of writing, and why. </p> </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#39:1>
The flurry of methods, approaches, & techniques in the teaching
of writing can be streamlined into 3 basic/distinct paradigms : 1) PRODUCT
ORIENTATION; 2) PROCESS APPROACH; and 3) PRAGMATIC VIEW. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#40:1>
The first is influenced by prescriptivists & structuralists who
view language as a set of rules & patterns that should be internalized to
achieve accuracy.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#41:1>
This is best represented by the era of composition writing, which my
grade school & high school teachers subjected me to.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#42:1>
Students who are under the tutelage of a product-oriented approach to
writing are made to write essays that adhere to the set objectives which
often dictate the type of rhetorical discourse & the specific language forms
to be used.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#43:1>
The grade for each composition is usually based on criteria that
include GRAMMAR & MECHANICS. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#44:1>
The second contests this emphasis on correctness & instead treats
writing as a PROCESS; hence the term...

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#45:1>
Rhetorical moves are not prescribed and elements of grammar are least
considered.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#46:1>
If writing were to be recognized as a product, it is a PRODUCT OF
REVISION because writing is not considered final until the idea ( a product
of brainstorming or any prewriting strategy) is satisfactorily communicated
to the intended audience ( via peer editing and constant revising). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#47:1>
The third shifts the focus from PROCESS to CONTEXT.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#48:1>
The pragmatic view underscores the interplay between the WRITER and
the SITUATION/DISCIPLINE/CONTENT/CULTURE.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#49:1>
This is where such approaches as WAC ( Writing across the
Curriculum), ESP ( English for Specific Purposes), & CBI ( Content-Based
Instruction) belong, the bottom line being that each field or discipline has
its own convention & register, so writing style must adjust accordingly.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#50:1>
Writing is subjected to correctness or accuracy as the field sees
fit.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#51:1>
In that sense, the pragmatic view becomes a combination of PRODUCT &
PROCESS. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#52:1>
Of these, it is the third that suits me best as a teacher of
research writing.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#53:1>
The course aims to help students write research reports on topics
generated in their specific field of discipline.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#54:1>
With this objective in mind, I combine PRODUCT with PROCESS by
prescribing the format ( Introduction-Method-Results-Discussion) and letting
the students go through revision of both content & structure. </p> <X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#X55:1>
3. Empirical research in reading instruction has advanced
strongly the importance of schema theory in reading instruction.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#X56:1>
a. Explain fully what schema theory is and what its implications are
for teaching.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#X57:1>
b. Explain and illustrate how culturally based and culturally biased
schema can cause comprehension problems among students. </p> </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#58:1>
<mention> Schema </mention> refers to an individual 's set of
beliefs shaped by his/her culture, background, personal experiences.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#59:1>
The Schema theory advocates the importance of this in comprehending a
text.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#60:1>
To the teacher, this means that since readers interact with the text,
the reading selections should not be culture-based & biased as this would
impede comprehension & sometimes mislead learners. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#61:1>
A Chinese short story, <mention> &ldquo; A Country Boy Quits
School, &rdquo; </mention> written as a strong reaction against western
colonization, matches the sentiments of readers who feel marginalized by
culture-based texts.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#62:1>
The author employs humor in the story, as evidenced by the following
accounts:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#63:1>
After a week in school, the boy learns a fable that features a
horse & an ox in a tea party.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#64:1>
Having heard of this, the grandmother is terrified because it was the
first time she heard of oxen & horses talking & drinking tea the way humans
do.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#65:1>
She thought these must have been frightful creatures that were
possessed by evil spirits ( which were common in Chinese myths).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#66:1>
But she kept this to herself. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#67:1>
On another occasion, she heard the boy reciting <quote> &ldquo;
This is mama," </quote> <quote> &ldquo; this is papa &rdquo; </quote> with
his gaze fixed on the pages of the book ( on his part, for fear that the
pictures would walk away).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#68:1>
She couldn't understand why the boy speaks of <mention> mama
</mention> & <mention> papa </mention> but does not mention <mention> grandma
</mention> & <mention> grandpa </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#69:1>
She became so furious, she wanted to leave the house on the account
that her grandson no longer loves his grandparents.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#70:1>
When the mother heard of this, she consulted the boy 's book &
wondered why <quote> &ldquo; This is mama &rdquo; </quote> showed somebody
else 's picture, not hers!

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#71:1>
Upon confrontation with the father, a series of other humorous scenes
ensue - all illustrating how TEXTS that speak of experiences beyond a person 's
schema can result in confusion because of differing cultures. </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#72:2>
<h> <bold> LANGUAGE THEORY </bold> </h> <X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#X73:2>
1. There is general agreement among scholars in the field that
one major property of discourse is <bold> MEANING </bold> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#X74:2>
Discuss the notion of meaning from <bold> two </bold> of the
following perspectives:

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#X75:2>
a. Speech Act Theory

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#X76:2>
b. Gricean Pragmatics

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#X77:2>
c. Conversational Analysis

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#X78:2>
d. Ethnography of Communication </p> </X>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#79:2>
<h> GRICEAN PRAGMATICS </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#80:2>
Meaning is inferred from utterances and is made clear between
interlocutors who abide by the COOPERATIVE PRINCIPLES that adhere to the FOUR
MAXIMS: Quantity, Quality, Relevance & Manner.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#81:2>
If the speaker communicates his/her intention in a way that is clear
& truthful & does not go beyond what is asked of him/her nor does he/she omit
information or add what he/she does not have proof of, then MEANING is
successfully communicated & the interlocutors understand each other because
there exists cooperation between speaker & hearer. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#82:2>
<h> CONVERSATIONAL ANALYSIS </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#83:2>
There exists a NEGOTIATION OF MEANING between the interlocutors &
this negotiation lasts in the same duration as that of the transaction.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#84:2>
Hence, meaning is created at the same time it is communicated; it is
interpreted and / or understood while it is being created.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#85:2>
This displays the complex ability of interlocutors who, when engaged
in conversation, are preoccupied with the burden of creating & transacting
meaning SIMULTANEOUSLY.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#86:2>
Likewise, this reflects the impressive capacity of humans to include
paralinguistic signals in the process of negotiating meaning; <foreign> i.e.
</foreign> accounting for the change in intonation or expression or other
non-verbals, in order to interpret what one wished to communicate.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#87:2>
Expressions used for REPAIR lend concrete evidence to this
NEGOTIATION OF MEANING; <foreign> e.g. </foreign> <mention> &ldquo; What did
you say?", </mention> <mention> &ldquo; Do you mean...", </mention> <mention>
&ldquo; You 're probably referring to... &rdquo; </mention> </p> <X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#X88:2>
2. Recent theories of second language acquisition have given
emphasis to communicative competence.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#X89:2>
Discuss this notion as a shift from the early paradigm of linguistic
competence and in terms of its relevance to you as an English teacher. </p>
</X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#90:2>
Communicative competence entails linguistic competence; <foreign>
i.e. </foreign> one cannot claim to have communicative competence if he/she
does not have knowledge of the grammar of the language he/she speaks, or what
is termed as <mention> LINGUISTIC COMPETENCE </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#91:2>
One who has knowledge of the inventory of sounds in a language, the
allowed ways by which these sounds can be combined, the knowledge of how
these combinations can constitute a word, a phrase & a sentence clearly has
linguistic competence - a manifestation of the internal or mental grammar
that is biologically endowed exclusively to humans.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#92:2>
Its correct application as gauged in utterance is termed as <mention>
LINGUISTIC PERFORMANCE </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#93:2>
When this performance accounts for APPROPRIATENESS; <foreign> i.e.
</foreign> what is said is in the right context - to the intended recipient,
at the right time, in the intended or socially acceptable manner, then one is
said to have COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#94:2>
Clearly, the shift is made from WHAT IS RIGHT ( a concern of
prescriptivists) to WHAT IS APPROPRIATE ( a concern of sociolinguists, in
general). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#95:2>
A <mention> Tarzan </mention> comic strip by Gary Larson
illustrates how encompassing & ( much more) important communicative
competence is: </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#96:2>
In the first 3 frames, Tarzan rehearses what he will say to Jane
on the occasion of their first meeting ( in which he displays linguistic
competence).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#97:2>
In separate thought bubbles are ( with some alterations as I couldn't
remember the sequence of the words exactly):

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#98:2>
Frame 1 : <quote> Hi.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#99:2>
Allow me to introduce myself, I am Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle.
</quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#100:2>
Frame 2 : <quote> My name is Tarzan, & I believe you are known as
Jane. </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#101:2>
Frame 3: <quote> It 's a pleasure to meet you.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#102:2>
I am Tarzan.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#103:2>
And you?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#104:2>
In the last Frame, however, upon meeting Jane face-to-face, he
fumbles ( which could be interpreted as lack of communicative competence):

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#105:2>
<quote> Me Tarzan! You Jane! </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#106:2>
after which he covers his face in shame. </p> <O> Smiley face </O>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#107:2>
As an English teacher, this paradigm shift demonstrates the
shift in focus of the English classroom.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-019#108:2>
Emphasis now should be given to the learner 's ability to produce
relevant/appropriate utterances, with feedback on grammatical construction
taking the sidelines & will be explicitly stated only on occasions where
meaning is obstructed by lack of linguistic competence. </p> </I>
