 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#1:1:A>
My name is Grandmasta Sleek <&> a disc jockey name </&> and uhm my real name is Adrian

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#2:1:B>
I am this is O D B and my real name is Jem

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#3:1:A>
And who is this guy <,> La Salle school <,> okay

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#4:1:B>
So anyways uh <,> G M S <,> uh what what do you have in mind for uh tomorrow evening

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#5:1:A>
Well it depends O D B it 's like uhm <,> well you got you already you got already the music the rap the free rap for the jingle

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#6:1:B>
I had the lyrics
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#7:1:B>
I think that uh Spoon will take care of uh the background
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#8:1:B>
I think he has an idea already what background music will fit the lyrics I wrote for the song
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#9:1:B>
So probably you know it 's for the big things that we have to do right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#10:1:B>
But I suggest we should just really <,> <unclear> 1 word </unclear> tonight if you have any <.> thesi </.> drag on papers and uh more organized when we when we wake up tomorrow something like that <,> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#11:1:A>
What I think you know uhm <O> laughs </O> there 's this uh radio ad radio ad though it 's in <unclear> word </unclear> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#12:1:A>
Yeah and what they did was uhm there 's this song for for for that you know for that commercial and then what they do is uh sample not really a sample but uh they sang the full song but they included a rap thing <unclear> words </unclear> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#13:1:A>
What do you think <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#14:1:B>
You know I 'm open to anything you know me I 'm a team player
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#15:1:B>
I I I just think I I think that we all agree that we 'll have to expand and have more jingles played uh <unclear> word </unclear> is calling me about single jingle they ask me about the different styles of jingles
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#16:1:B>
And due to circumstances right now because there 's a trend we can't get it done but I 'm looking forward to tomorrow evening hopefully we 'll get our work done and uh you know well I just just get it done tomorrow

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#17:1:A>
Oh but you know I it just so happened that I know this person in <?> Texas </?> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#18:1:A>
He said that uh the jingle sucks but the D Js encourage it <,,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#19:1:B>
Well you know good observation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#20:1:B>
I just wonder who this person is 



<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#> I mean if he is like a media mogul I might respect what he has to say
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#21:1:B>
But if he is a regular person is you know whatever you know you can't please everybody
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#22:1:B>
We have you know maybe there 's one person saying <,> this I can't see it negative I mean they <.> accur </.> we 're amateurs uh you know and stuff like that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#23:1:B>
But uh for the one we for the one we uh get negative feedback we have but ten maybe more positive feedback you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#24:1:B>
So that 's all
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#25:1:B>
But you can't please everybody you know I mean hey that 's the way it is right uh you know <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#26:1:B>
Hey what can you do you know exactly you can't please them all can you

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#27:1:A>
It 's true but then uhm what what we need to do probably is uh is like this
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#28:1:A>
Probably we could choose to jingle in such a way that this uh studio studio type of the jingle and uh <.> wha </.> I well actually my friend 's gonna do is like uh he 'll make up the jingle again and he 'll uh transcribe really transcribe and then he 'll put it you know in a in a winzip rap

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#29:1:B>
With

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#30:1:A>
Zip rap and then track by track I think he 'll be recording them
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#31:1:A>
He 'll be transferring them and uh into the studio on Wednesday like midnight and do it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#32:1:A>
He 'll do the rap <unclear> words </unclear> and it 's free

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#33:1:B>
Yeah you know uh it 's a <,> sign to uh <,> really get going I mean there are there are listeners out there who like the station and it 's true we have to sort of become more you know presentable right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#34:1:B>
Not just blah you know what I mean I think that 's enough that 's an excuse already you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#35:1:B>
We don't have the time and maybe lack maybe lack of uh financial resources but uhm <,> we have if we 've had time to really uhm to start uhm creating uhm let 's say a <unclear> word </unclear> jingle or or whatever to make it seem more like a viable or a real uhm radio station you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#36:1:B>
I understand you know that you know that we could use comments or criticisms
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#37:1:B>
I oh you know what <,> that 'll only make us stronger you know no matter if it 's negative or positive criticism it should only make us stronger
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#38:1:B>
It should make us try to improve ourselves and uh do better at the station and uh you know <,> I 'm I 'm satisfied with so far what 's going on
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#39:1:B>
Uhm of course of course I wanna do much more you know before uhm before I 'm done with my thing here
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#40:1:B>
I really want a nice set-up really and uhm and uh basically whoever comes in after us you know has an easier time than us you know pioneering this stuff
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#41:1:B>
You 've got to remember uhm this is pioneering stuff you know this is uh we 're the first college to ever have our own F M radio station not just it 's not easy you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#42:1:B>
You can't just you can't mimic exactly what they do in uh other stations because they have the resources they have the technology you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#43:1:B>
We we we 've worked hard to uh set certain criteria or certain uh uh protocol to to be a to be you know to to maximize uhm to be effective
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#44:1:B>
But uh you know I 'm <,> I 'm satisfied with what 's going on you know but of course there 's so much so much more room for improvement
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#45:1:B>
I mean <,> we we 're we 're just only beginning you know

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#46:1:A>
That 's true and probably and the thing is uhm we 're doing we 're doing good now and <,> the the booboos that we that we uh <.> commi </.> commit uh before is is part of it first time thing you know first time we lose
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#48:1:A>
Now I think I could probably I could probably say that uhm we 've gone far away from what we had before
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#49:1:A>
And you know I I 've talked to Mr Marasigan a while ago and uhm and he told me that uhm well the station should like uh the station is quite good compared to before
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#50:1:A>
So it 's you know booboos and the mistakes you know we made we got those uh bad air times sort of things like that right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#51:1:A>
Well uhm more of that well the thing that I got a feedback that we 're not amateurs <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#52:1:A>
Well what I think about that is that we 're really amateurs
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#53:1:A>
We don't we don't get paid with this right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#54:1:A>
That 's why we 're we 're still amateurs
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#55:1:A>
Professionals do get paid and we 're lucky to be the first uhm college or university to be to get an L M an F M band
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#56:1:A>
It 's the first time in the Philippines I think

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#57:1:B>
Oh <.> abso </.> absolutely
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#58:1:B>
You know I I think that uh the difference between professionals and amateurs has been simply cash flow
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#59:1:B>
We don't have the money and uh with that in mind we 've had to you know be basic but you know we were able to uhm minimize uh minimize losses maximize gains
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#60:1:B>
And uh you know with that I I I I 've been really uhm you know happy even proud you know that uh that uh stuff has turned out the way it has
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#61:1:B>
You know where we 're trying we 're trying to be professional in the in the office you know and that 's the place where we should be professional and uhm and outside you know we can be friends or whatever
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#62:1:B>
That 's fine I think people have been able to start really now to divide uh personal and professionalism
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#63:1:B>
That 's very important I think amongst the group
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#64:1:B>
So you know things have gotten better
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#65:1:B>
Of course I can't say it 's been perfect
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#66:1:B>
We 've had some rock rocky times you know and uhm some things going on here but uh I 'm glad to say that we were able to work things out and uh in the end you know we all have to remember that we 're a team
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#67:1:B>
It 's not about just one of us one part of the of the of the body we 're a complete body and we work best when we all function function well you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#68:1:B>
So uhm you 've got never mind you know it 's it 's it 's just uhm <,> it 's just getting better I mean I can't I can't see us going down anyway
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#69:1:B>
I mean I mean we 're just gonna <?> flung </?> one uhm upper and up uh I I 'm really confident that uh we 're gonna get more listeners and get more attention that 's uh they probably out of the <unclear> word </unclear> entry
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#70:1:B>
You know we 've been known already and uh no matter no matter if it 's positive or negative we 're making noise you know that 's the point
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#71:1:B>
That 's how we want to do you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#72:1:B>
We have to capture them like before but if it were if it we 're causing a stir that makes people talk
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#73:1:B>
Hey why not you know any publicity is good publicity even if it 's bad so <O> stutter </O> that 's what I can say about that

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#74:1:A>
What I think is that uh <O> laughs </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#75:1:A>
Why are you laughing

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#76:1:B>
Uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#77:1:A>
<indig> Ha </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#78:1:A>
You 're all good <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#79:1:A>
I guess that uhm <,> we should we should like uhm <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#80:1:A>
Oh here 's this thing uhm we should like probably uhm <,> get some more uhm advertisement not really advertisements but then some more promotions for our radio station 'cause sometimes you know and then know there was this one time <,> <O> laughs </O> at band camp <&> a line from the movie American Pie </&> <,> you know that movie <O> laughs </O> no no no

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#81:1:B>
I know exactly the movie you 're talking about but we won't mention it right now

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#82:1:A>
You know exactly the movie

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#83:1:B>
But I know what it is

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#84:1:A>
What is it come on

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#85:1:B>
I know the flute <O> laughs </O> yes <O> laughs </O> and I didn't know anyway basically thanks for bringing that up
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#86:1:B>
I 'm curious about <mention> American Pie </mention> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#87:1:A>
I was I was doing a line actually

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#88:1:B>
Uh okay

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#89:1:A>
Oh yeah there was this like a while ago there was this uhm classmate of mine she was in the what 's this INTEORG <&> course code for International Organizations </&> classmate of mine
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#90:1:A>
She she goes like and said uhm I go like about did you hear the radio station and she said oh you have a radio station <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#91:1:A>
She goes like oh I didn't know that 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#92:1:A>
I said yeah we have it it 's it 's like eighty-nine point five 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#93:1:A>
Oh by the way O D B why did you transfer from eighty-seven to eighty-nine point five

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#94:1:B>
Uhm as far as as I know I remember Sir explaining that uhm the frequency anything below eighty-eight is considered emerging frequencies and uh uh this does not exist like on the radio dial for some strange reasons
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#95:1:B>
So like uh when Sir went to the N T C <&> National Telecommunications Company </&> to discuss it they explained to him that and uh then we had to make our change
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#96:1:B>
You know from eighty-eight point seven but strangely enough someone else 's already there I mean I believe right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#97:1:B>
So uhm like adjust eighty-nine point five you know I I mean we 're we 're the new boys now eighty-nine point one eighty-nine point nine but uh it 's it 's been okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#98:1:B>
So far so good
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#99:1:B>
Uh you know I might have considered so about other stations maybe are trying to turn out our signal or or what
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#100:1:B>
I don't know I 'm sure but uh since it 's been okay it 's been what it 's been a while now it 's been some time now
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#101:1:B>
Uhm but concerning about uh the uh <,> the ads and the promotion uhm I think the main the main <.> pr </.> the main problem is that uh when when they when they decided to develop this project and uh whatever uhm <,> they did not think about the bigger picture
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#102:1:B>
Like months it 's finished where where it will be in outlets for the students and teachers to actually you know enjoy and listen to it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-026#103:1:B>
And strangely enough we 've had to go on to canvass and discuss with certain uh avenues like uh uh the canteen and uh that 's why I really uh uhm not that uh it angers me but it it irks me kind of thing you know 

 </I>
