<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#1:1:A>
If Your Honors please uh we received at uh one thirty-five uh
this afternoon a copy of the comment opposition to motion to quash filed by
the prosecution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#2:1:A>
We note in this comment which the prosecution has filed that they do
not dispute the facts on the basis of which the motion to quash is predicated
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#3:1:A>
I shall therefore no longer deal with the facts and proceed <,> to
deal with the arguments
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#4:1:A>
The motion to quash uh is based on no less than the Constitution
itself particularly Article eleven entitled <mention> Accountability of
Public Officers </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#5:1:A>
Under Article eleven Section three Subparagraph six <quote> The
Senate shall have the sole power to try and decide all cases of impeachment
 </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#6:1:A>
When is there a case of impeachment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#7:1:A>
There is a case of impeachment when pursuant to Section three
Subparagraph one <quote> The House of Representatives exercises its exclusive
power to initiate a case of impeachment </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#8:1:A>
The Senate would have no jurisdiction to deal with a matter of
impeachment unless the impeachment case comes to the Senate from the House of
Representatives which under Section three Subparagraph one has <quote> the
exclusive power to initiate all cases of impeachment </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#9:1:A>
So now if Your Honors please I shall deal with the power of the
House of Representatives
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#10:1:A>
The Constitution itself provides as to how the House of
Representatives may exercise its exclusive power to initiate a case of
impeachment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#11:1:A>
This is described and provided for in Subparagraphs two three and
four of Section three Article eleven
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#12:1:A>
Let me first deal with our first ground if Your Honors please that
the House of Representatives has not initiated a case of impeachment and that
the case of impeachment now before the Senate was not initiated by the House
of representatives
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#13:1:A>
As I have stated if Your Honors please Section three Paragraph one
says <mention> the House of Representatives </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#14:1:A>
It does not say one-third of the members of the House of
Representatives
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#15:1:A>
It says <quote> The House of Representatives shall have the
exclusive power to initiate all cases of impeachment </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#16:1:A>
The case of impeachment before the Senate was not forwarded to the
Senate by the House of Representatives
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#17:1:A>
I have looked at transmissions of bills approved by the House of
Representatives for concurrence of the Senate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#18:1:A>
They are sent by the Secretary-General and the Secretary-General
explicitly states in his letter of transmission that he does so upon
instruction of the House of Representatives
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#19:1:A>
The case of impeachment now before the Senate if Your Honors please
and we have appended as Annex A of our motion to quash the Journal of the
House of Representatives of November thirteen two thousand
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#20:1:A>
<quote> The meeting was called to order the National Anthem was
sung the Speaker read a prayer and immediately he made a manifestation the
entire manifestation consisting of a reading of the report of the Committee
on Justice to the House on the verified complaint for impeachment against His
Excellency President Joseph Ejercito Estrada </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#21:1:A>
There were some attempts on the part of members of the House to
raise point of order but they were ignored by the Speaker
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#22:1:A>
He continued uh to read simply the report of the Committee on the
Judiciary and I call your attention particularly to this portion of the
report and this is quoted at page six of our motion the second full paragraph
and I quote <quote> Likewise upon motion which was unanimously approved the
body resolved to refer to the plenary for further appropriate action the
verified complaint and the verified resolutions of endorsement of
seventy-seven members of the House filed by them apparently in line with the
 <unclear> 2 words </unclear> <foreign> etcetera </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#23:1:A>
I emphasize if Your Honors please that what the Committee on the
Judiciary approved was to refer to the plenary not to the Speaker to refer to
the plenary for further appropriate action the verified complaint and the
verified resolutions of endorsement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#24:1:A>
Of course if Your Honors please at the conclusion of the report it
says <quote> accordingly the impeachment complaint which shall constitute the
articles of impeachment together with the verified resolutions of endorsement
are hereby forwarded to the Speaker </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#25:1:A>
This obviously Your Honors please is not a pronouncement of the
Committee on the Judiciary
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#26:1:A>
This perhaps was a statement of the chairman of the Committee on
the Judiciary
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#27:1:A>
And if you are to read this and relate this to the portions of the
report of the judiciary I have read this would mean that the matter is
referred to the plenary through the Speaker for further appropriate action
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#28:1:A>
Now <,> after reading the report of the Committee on the Judiciary
Speaker Villar simply said and this is I 'm reading from the Journal <quote> 
Speaker Villar thereafter manifested that since the Constitution mandates
that when at least one-third of all the members of the House files a verified
complaint or a resolution of impeachment the same shall constitute the
articles of impeachment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#29:1:A>
<X> And the duty of the House becomes peremptory and ministerial to
endorse it to the Senate for trial in the same manner as an approved bill
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#X30:1:A>
Accordingly the Speaker directed the Secretary-General to
immediately transmit to the Senate the impeachment complaint constituting the
articles of impeachment together with the verified resolutions of endorsement
 </X> </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#31:1:A>
You will note if Your Honors please that even Speaker Villar spoke
of the duty of the House not the duty of the Speaker but the duty of the
House whether peremptory whether ministerial or by whatever way you describe
it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#32:1:A>
The power and to Speaker Villar the duty was vested is vested by
the Constitution in the House of Representatives and not in the Speaker
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#33:1:A>
So then it may be asked but what could the House have done
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#34:1:A>
One-third is just a matter of counting numbers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#35:1:A>
There can be no dispute about that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#36:1:A>
Perhaps none but even the counting of the number is a
responsibility of the House and not a responsibility of the Speaker
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#37:1:A>
But apart from that and perhaps even more substantial I would
concede that Speaker Villar would have no difficulty counting whether there
is one-third but perhaps he would have had trouble determining whether the
complaint and the resolutions were verified
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#38:1:A>
If these were submitted to the House questions would have been
raised as in fact these questions were manifested in a subsequent session of
the House of Representatives as to the adequacy of the verification which
appeared in the resolutions appended to the complaint
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#39:1:A>
So it is clear the House took no action on the complaint and the
resolutions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#40:1:A>
Speaker Villar merely acted as a post office transmitting it to the
Senate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#41:1:A>
But the Constitution requires that even if Speaker Villar were to
be a post office the stamp had to be placed there not by Speaker Villar but
by authority of the House of Representatives
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#42:1:A>
That is our first ground if Your Honors please
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#43:1:A>
That is why it is our submission that the case before the Senate is
not a case of impeachment over which the Senate may exercise jurisdiction
simply because it has it did not come to the Senate by virtue of the exercise
the exclusive the exercise of the exclusive power to impeach of the House of
Representatives
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#44:1:A>
Now we now go to the second ground
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#45:1:A>
While Section three Subparagraph one speaks of the House of
Representatives having the exclusive power to initiate all cases of
impeachment Subparagraphs two three and four describe how the House of
Representatives may initiate a case of impeachment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#46:1:A>
It provides ways that is described in Subparagraph two and that
which is described in Subparagraph four
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#47:1:A>
It is our submission well that what is before the Senate has come
purportedly pursuant to Section three Paragraph four which provides <quote> 
In case the verified complaint or resolution of impeachment is filed by at
least one-third of all the members of the House the same shall constitute the
articles of impeachment and trial by the Senate shall proceed forthwith
proceed </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#48:1:A>
We emphasize if Your Honors please that firstly the complaint or
resolution must be verified and secondly that it must be filed by at least
one-third of all the members of the House
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#49:1:A>
It 's not disputed that the complaint <.> bef </.> now before the
Senate was not filed by one-third
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#50:1:A>
The number of representatives who endorsed amounted to more than
one-third because of resolutions of endorsement which were appended or added
to the original endorsers that is after October twelve two thousand
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#51:1:A>
The complaint was originally endorsed only by thirty-eight
representatives
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#52:1:A>
But on November six two thousand the Committee on Justice took note
that there were now seventy-seven representatives
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#53:1:A>
So it is not disputed that the complaint was not filed by at least
one-third
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#54:1:A>
The more important requirement in our view is the requirement that
the complaint or resolution be verified
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#55:1:A>
It is our submission that this requirement is substantial in nature
and may not be dispensed with
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#56:1:A>
Let us recall that under Section three Subparagraph two which is
another mode of initiating a case of impeachment before the House of
Representatives not now by at least one-third but possibly by a complaint by
a private citizen which is endorsed by any member of the House
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#57:1:A>
What is significant up under Section three <.> par </.> 
Subparagraph two is that after the complaint is filed it 's ceasing it is
required to be included in the order of business within ten session days and
then this is the more important part <quote> and referred to the proper
committee within three session days thereafter </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#58:1:A>
The Committee the Constitution provides the Committee after hearing
and by majority of all its members shall submit its report to the House
 <foreign> etcetera </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#59:1:A>
For what purpose does the Committee conduct a hearing
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#60:1:A>
Well the <.> hul </.> the rules of the House are clear
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#61:1:A>
This hearing under its Rule three entitled <mention> Finding a
Probable Cause </mention> the hearing is conducted to determine whether there
is probable cause
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#62:1:A>
Evidence is received by the Committee for the complainant as well
as evidence for the respondent
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#63:1:A>
The Committee will then determine will then evaluate the evidence
and determine whether there is probable cause
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#64:1:A>
And after having determined whether there is probable cause the
matter is then submitted through a report of the Committee to the House for a
vote
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#65:1:A>
We emphasize this because under Subparagraph four where at least
one-third of the members of the House file a complaint for impeachment the
hearing is dispensed with
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#66:1:A>
In other words evidence is not received
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#67:1:A>
There is no determination of probable cause
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#68:1:A>
But in lieu of that the Constitution requires that the complaint be
verified
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#69:1:A>
Why does the Constitution consider verification of a complaint by
one-third of the members of the House sufficient
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#70:1:A>
Why does the Constitution consider this in lieu of a hearing uh
adequate to determine probable cause
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#71:1:A>
In our motion we have quoted the provisions of the rules of court
which were then enforced in nineteen eighty-seven when the Constitution was
uh written and ratified
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#72:1:A>
Verification means taking an oath attesting to the truth of the
allegations of the complaint on the basis of one 's own knowledge
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#73:1:A>
Otherwise stated at least one-third of the members of the House
would be saying under oath the allegations of facts of the complaint are true
because we know it to be true
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#74:1:A>
I would assume therefore I would assume that when one-third of the
members of the House say under oath and under pain of perjury that the
allegations of the complaint are true that can be accepted in lieu of a
hearing
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#75:1:A>
Let it not be suggested that that would make it difficult for any
complaint of <.> imp </.> for impeachment to be passed by the House
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#76:1:A>
There is no difficulty because then if not one-third of the members
of the House swear under oath that the allegations of the complaint are true
of their knowledge then you go to the first method and that is refer the
complaint to the Committee on the Judiciary receive evidence and on the basis
of that evidence determine probable cause <O> several seconds pause </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#77:1:A>
I apologize my attention has been called that in the House it is
called Committee on Justice perhaps it is a more appropriate name than
Judiciary <O> clears throat </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#78:1:A>
Now <,> what is the verification we find in the complaint and the
resolutions appended to the complaint which is now before the Senate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#79:1:A>
The verification reads and I will read the the positive portion
 <quote> that we have caused the complaint </quote> uh <quote> that the
allegations therein </quote> that is in the complaint <quote> are true of our
own knowledge and belief on the basis of our reading and appreciation of
documents and other records pertinent thereto </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#80:1:A>
Let me repeat it <quote> the allegations are true of our own
knowledge and belief </quote> but the key clause or the key phrase after that
is this <quote> on the basis of our reading and appreciation of documents and
other records pertinent thereto </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#81:1:A>
So whoever signed the verifications to this complaint as well as
the resolution did not say this uh the allegations of facts are true of my
knowledge he says they are true because I believe them to be true on the
basis of my reading and appreciation of documents and other records pertinent
thereto
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#82:1:A>
Indeed nobody knows what these records and pertinent records are
they are not identified
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#83:1:A>
This we submit is not a verification of fact
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#84:1:A>
When one speaks of verification in law it is verification of facts
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#85:1:A>
This is not a verification of fact it is a statement of an opinion
because when one says based on my reading and appreciation of documents one
makes renders an opinion
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#86:1:A>
Two persons can easily disagree on one how one appreciates a
document
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#87:1:A>
And now you are talking of seventy-seven persons or even more
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#88:1:A>
Each one of them could have had their appreciation of documents
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#89:1:A>
And these are documents which we are unable even to verify as to
whether those appreciations are reasonable enough for them to be accepted
because the documents and the records are not identified
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#90:1:A>
So we then have before the Senate articles of impeachment on the
 <.> ar </.> articles of impeachment on which there has been no finding or
warrant of probable cause either by evidence or by the oath of one-third of
the members of the House of representatives
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#91:1:A>
That being the case if Your Honors please the complaint before the
House cannot qualify under Section three Subparagraph four of Article eleven
of the Constitution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#92:1:A>
Let me suggest if Your Honors please why the Constitution perhaps
require this
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#93:1:A>
It will be recalled that under the nineteen thirty-five
Constitution perhaps uh the Constitution which we have had which was least
exposed to partisan considerations other than perhaps our desire then to
become independent
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#94:1:A>
Under that Constitution in order that the House of Representatives
may impeach an official a vote of two-thirds was required and in order that
the Senate may convict a three-fourths vote was required
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-061#95:1:A>
This requirement has been relaxed </I>
