<I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#1:1:A>
Just leave it here <&> talks to speaker Z about
cassette-recorder </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#2:1:A>
So anyway like I was saying right

 <$Z> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#3:1:Z> <indig> Lakasan nyo na lang ang boses nyo </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#4:1:A>
What was I saying
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#5:1:A>
<indig> Ayun nga </indig> so <indig> parang </indig> I said I don't
care
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#6:1:A>
<&> says to Speaker Z </&> You can go now <O> coughs </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#7:1:A>
What was I saying I mean uhm <,> uh so I told James right <{> <[> 
that </[> <.> tha </.> what Trish told me

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#8:1:B>
<[> That </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#9:1:A>
Trish is like please tell James I don't care if it means having
to stop seeing him but her point is that she is just tired already
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#10:1:A>
Trish is like if you care about me the way you say you are then
show it right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#11:1:A>
And then so James he <.> feel </.> he feels bad
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#12:1:A>
James is like he 's sitting there and he said I 'm really sorry and
he hugged me you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#13:1:A>
He goes you know I understand now what your sister is saying
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#14:1:A>
And then he goes I 'm sorry I took you for granted you know you had
you didn't deserve to feel that way I 'm really sorry
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#15:1:A>
At least James understands that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#16:1:B>
Right

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#17:1:A>
And then after but he said like little by little that 's when
he 's gonna let it out
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#18:1:A>
So that night <,> with the whole gang there right <,> uh Trish was
like they better not play that song and then they did right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#19:1:A>
They played the song

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#20:1:B>
Uhm what song was that

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#21:1:A>
<unclear> words </unclear> and that 's part of the C D that uh
that James gave James bought Trish right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#22:1:A>
So Trish looks at him
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#23:1:A>
It was so funny 'cause Trish looks at him with this look on her
face
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#24:1:A>
Oh my God that 's our song right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#25:1:A>
And James looks at her like don't come any closer or I 'm gonna you
know lean over and lay one on you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#26:1:A>
So James James goes I 'm about to give in I really am I said and
then Trish goes uhm are you sure I mean everyone 's here
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#27:1:A>
And then James says I don't care anymore I don't care who knows in
fact I want the whole world to know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#28:1:A>
Of course that meant a lot to Trish <unclear> word </unclear> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#29:1:A>
Are you serious
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#30:1:A>
So that everyone started dancing right and that both that singer
guy goes over to Trish and gets her hand right and she goes on <?> playing
 </?> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#31:1:A>
But then that guy calls her up later on and says hey I saw you and
James uh you were pretty sweet
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#32:1:A>
Trish is like uh so so we are right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#33:1:A>
And then yeah he was I I guess well James keeps saying that that
guy likes Trish but Trish doesn't care because Trish is in love with James

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#34:1:B>
<unclear> words </unclear> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#35:1:A>
And for the first time you know Trish found someone who when
when she looks at him everyone else falls into <unclear> words </unclear> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#36:1:A>
It 's just him I mean not that she disregards everyone
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#37:1:A>
They 're there but it 's just him
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#38:1:A>
He 's all that is important
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#39:1:A>
And she doesn't care if her ex-boyfriend passes by or his
ex-girlfriend passes by
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#40:1:A>
All that matters is that they 're together in the same area

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#41:1:B>
Trish is a lot prettier than his ex-girlfriend

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#42:1:A>
<O> laughs </O> Well I 'm sure Trish would like that would
like to hear that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#43:1:B>
Yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#44:1:A>
But for a while Trish felt it she was like you know <unclear> 
words </unclear> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#45:1:B>
Was she the reason why they broke up

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#46:1:A>
I don't think so <,> I hope not

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#47:1:B>
I hope not

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#48:1:A>
I 'd hate for Trish to be a home-wrecker I mean you know it 's
bad enough what Trish went through in the first relationship with you know
all that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#49:1:B>
Yeah <,> I remember that

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#50:1:A>
<O> laughs </O> And yeah and oh yeah uhm James was saying
something like oh there 's something about what you said that I was uhm Trish 's
uhm uhm ex-relationships right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#51:1:A>
James James was just telling her it 's all in the family you know
family and it was fun because they were trying to be they would see her that
they 're together <,> and Trish even said you know James I 'm sorry about the
break-up but I 'm even sorrier because I 'm not really sorry
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#52:1:A>
Get it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#53:1:A>
Trish is like I feel bad that you guys broke up but I don't feel
that bad oh but I feel worse that I 'm not sincere I mean in fact <{> <[> I 'm
happy </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#54:1:B>
<[> It only </[> </{> shows she doesn't love him that much

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#55:1:A>
Yeah but I was happy that you know

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#56:1:B>
Said Trish

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#57:1:A>
Yeah Trish was saying that I was happy that you broke up I
guess not that she wanted James to be hurt it 's because I don't know I guess
she felt that she wanted to give James something more <unclear> words
 </unclear> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#58:1:B>
<unclear> words </unclear> and Trish calls her

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#59:1:A>
Trish never calls his ex-girlfriend by her full name by her
full name
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#60:1:A>
Trish always calls her <mention> would-be ex-girlfriend </mention> 
like Trish <unclear> word </unclear> she said that you know you and your
ex-girlfriend because if if Trish calls her by her real name it would sound
like they knew each other right

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#61:1:B>
But that 's <unclear> words </unclear> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#62:1:A>
We they were introduced uh we were all in here and then they
were introduced
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#63:1:A>
In fact James goes oh yeah you know this is my sweetie and then you
know sweetie this is Trish
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#64:1:A>
So it was kind of weird you know because the next I think a couple
of weeks after that they broke up

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#65:1:B>
Uh-uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#66:1:A>
And then a week later on or a couple of weeks later on <,> she 's
walking down the street sees his car knocks on a window she he puts he rolls
the window down and she looks in and Trish and James were in the car right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#67:1:A>
So she looked she gave Trish this mean like <,> bad
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#68:1:A>
Trish didn't know what to do she was sitting there oh my God <,> 
James she shouldn't have seen me I shouldn't have been here
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#69:1:A>
And James is like I don't care you know screw that she you know she
left me she 's got her own reasons why can't I go out on my own
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#70:1:A>
But I guess for a while James was struggling to make Trish feel
like she 's the most important person in his life he kept calling her up
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#71:1:A>
I guess sometimes <unclear> words </unclear> because like yesterday
Trish and James were somewhere there right after uhm James <unclear> word
 </unclear> and then James 's ex-girlfriend happened to be there

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#72:1:B>
Oh the other one the older one

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#73:1:A>
Yeah the older

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#74:1:B>
Yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#75:1:A>
Yeah that girl

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#76:1:B>
That <{> <[> bitch </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#77:1:A>
That <[> girl </[> </{> yeah that B S
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#78:1:A>
Right so I was sitting by the lobby you know where the photocopying
machine is and she was there and I said hey what 's up you know

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#79:1:B>
That 's true <unclear> words </unclear> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#80:1:A>
<O> laughs </O> I think so I mean not to <unclear> words
 </unclear> about but you know when I see that girl she 's like a like a like
a prostitute or a dead person

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#81:1:B>
Yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#82:1:A>
She 's so white I mean she used to stare at me in a mean way
every time I 'm near her

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#83:1:B>
She did it to Trish too <,,> all of her <unclear> words
 </unclear> when she comes in

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#84:1:A>
<O> laughs </O> Holy cow
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#85:1:A>
So you know uhm Trish walked over sat down and then the girl Shelly
goes hey hi you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#86:1:A>
Trish was like hey hi and then Shelly 's like oh that 's a nice
jacket and Trish was like thanks but it 's not mine
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#87:1:A>
Whose jacket is that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#88:1:A>
James
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#89:1:A>
Oh and she has a look like oh okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#90:1:A>
Shelly 's like so uhm are you tired why don't you go home
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#91:1:A>
Yeah I will in a while I 'm just waiting
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#92:1:A>
And then she asks like what are you waiting for right and she was
like when James is finished
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#93:1:A>
Oh okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#94:1:A>
And then for a minute there I think Shelly gets it then she looks
then she goes so what 's up with you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#95:1:A>
I mean Trish and Shelly would never boast

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#96:1:B>
Correct yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#97:1:A>
Yeah right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#98:1:A>
In fact when they came to the station <,> you know Shelly was like
hi hi hi d hi but then in the hallway they wouldn't look at each other

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#99:1:B>
Not

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#100:1:A>
Yeah
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#101:1:A>
So you know it 's not fishy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#102:1:A>
And then uhm she goes so what 's up with you I mean do you have a
boyfriend
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#103:1:A>
Then Trish is like what no I broke up with him a long time ago
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#104:1:A>
It is a long time ago I mean you know if you think about it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#105:1:B>
Pretty much

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#106:1:A>
Yeah I mean emotionally it 's not like a long time ago and
then Shelly goes oh so are you going out with anyone
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#107:1:A>
But then James told her already before <,> a couple of weeks after
I don't care if she finds out that we 're dating
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#108:1:A>
In fact James told his best friend <,> that you know <,,> that
they were dating
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#109:1:A>
And I you know like Trish is just oh my gosh she was telling me
right she 's like I 'm the happiest girl alive because I mean how would you
feel when your guy tells his best friend that he 's finally dating
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#110:1:A>
That 's a sweet thing when it comes from a guy right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#111:1:A>
So when I heard about it I was happy for her too but oh my God
that 's that 's exciting and and he he he 's got the same birthday as Trish
 <,> same day yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#112:1:B>
Really

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#113:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#114:1:B>
It 's so weird

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#115:1:A>
I know it 's so weird right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#116:1:A>
And then yeah so there and I was thrilled when I heard about it I
was <unclear> words </unclear> and James sounded so excited
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#117:1:A>
He sounded like a little boy who 's just got a star in class like
you know what I told my best friend we were dating and Trish was like oh my
God that is really sweet

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#118:1:B>
And then uhm to think that they 're going out on a week-end I
think uhm Trish uhm James their friends the other couple Marlon <,> <&> 
corrects herself </&> Marlo and <,> Junior

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#119:1:A>
Marlon and Junior yeah there we go Marlo and Junior
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#120:1:A>
It 's gonna be Marlo Junior Trish James and then uhm Bert <O> 
laughs </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#121:1:B>
And his uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#122:1:A>
His wife Rubber Ducky <&> a DJ name </&> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#123:1:B>
Yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#124:1:A>
His Rubber Ducky
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#125:1:A>
It 's gonna be fun well I don't know I heard that James invited
Bert but Bert is not sure

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#126:1:B>
Yeah <unclear> words </unclear> James Trish Marlo

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#127:1:A>
I know because it will give us you know it will give them the
chance

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#128:1:B>
Yeah it 's like a double date for them

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#129:1:A>
I know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#130:1:A>
Well James asked Trish if it was okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#131:1:A>
Trish is like he 's your best friend
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#132:1:A>
Again I 'm not gonna say no to that she says but then I guess yeah
it would be sweeter to <unclear> words </unclear> other you know I mean I I

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#133:1:B>
Marlo already asked her Dad or told her Dad to leave her

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#134:1:A>
When was that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#135:1:B>
Her Dad said <unclear> words </unclear> so I guess it 's all
right

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#136:1:A>
Yes

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#137:1:B>
Yeah it is and then

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#138:1:A>
I heard

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#139:1:B>
And then Marlo just said <unclear> words </unclear> Trish 's
sister is there right now

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#140:1:A>
Oh you know what 's so cool

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#141:1:B>
What

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#142:1:A>
'Cause Trish Trish said that it was it was uh Marlo 's
birthday right

<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#144:1:A>

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-015#146:1:B>
