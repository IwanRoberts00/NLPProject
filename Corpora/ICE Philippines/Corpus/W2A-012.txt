<h> <bold> ABSTRACT </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#4:1>
<it> In December 1995, a grant was provided by the UNFPA through
the DOH Family Planning Service to De La Salle University Social Development
Research Center ( SDRC) to undertake an evaluation of quality of care in
family planning services in different service delivery points ( SDPs) in the
country.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#5:1>
The objectives of the evaluation were as follows: ( 1) to describe the
availability and quality of family planning activities in a sample of service
delivery points in the country; ( 2) to analyze the relationship between
subsystem functioning and the quality of services and posit modifications at
the programmatic and policy levels; and ( 3) to derive meaningful indicators
for the assessment of quality of care which relate to client satisfaction and
program performance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#6:1>
The approach to assess the quality in family planning service
delivery was to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the program focusing
on all major subsystems.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#7:1>
Using both observation and interviewing techniques, information was
collected on the key indicators of family planning subsystems, quality of
care, and SDO performance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#8:1>
Three basic questions were addressed by this study to help program
managers and administrators develop policy recommendations for the program
guidance and possible redirection; make necessary improvements in the range,
type, and quality of services provided; and establish baseline measures for
planning and evaluating future improvement: ( 1) Is each subsystem in place,
that is, ready to provide services?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#9:1>
These are: ( a) logistics/supplies; ( b) facilities/equipment; ( c)
staff; ( d) supervision/management; ( e) information, education, and
communication ( IEC); and ( f) record keeping.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#10:1>
( 2) If in place, is each subsystem functioning and ready to provide
quality services?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#11:1>
( 3) If each subsystem is functioning, are quality of services
actually being provided and received?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#12:1>
The six components include: ( a) choice of contraceptive methods; (
b) provider-client information exchange such as understanding client needs
and information given to clients; ( c) provider competence; ( d)
client-provider interaction; ( e) mechanisms to encourage continuity; and (
f) constellation of services. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#13:1>
A set of forms was utilized.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#14:1>
Results were tabulated and recommendations were generated. </it> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#15:1>
<h> <bold> Introduction </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#16:1>
The 1993 Philippine National Demographic Survey ( NDS) revealed a
wide gap between awareness and utilization of family planning methods.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#17:1>
Virtually all currently married women knew of one or more family
planning methods ( 97 percent), while 61 percent had never used any.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#18:1>
The contraceptive prevalence rate was estimated as 40 percent of
currently married women.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#19:1>
One common method of assessing the quality of contraceptive practice
is to examine the first year continuation rates defined as the proportion of
acceptors who are still using a method within 12 months after the start of
use.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#20:1>
Results showed that overall, one in three users discontinued their
chosen method in the first year of use.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#21:1>
The discontinuation rate was highest for the condom ( 59 percent),
followed by withdrawal ( 41 percent), and the pill ( 40 percent).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#22:1>
Side effects were cited as the major reason for termination of pill
use. <fnr> <sp> 1 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#23:1>
However, it was recognized that other factors might have accounted
for the low rate of acceptance and continuation which could be related to the
service provision itself. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#24:1>
Bruce ( 1990) cited a neglected dimension in the use-continuation
of family planning - - the quality of care rendered.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#25:1>
She posited that improvements in the quality of service will result
in a larger, more committed clientele of satisfied contraceptive users.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#26:1>
Over the long term, this expanded base of well served individuals
will translate into higher contraceptive prevalence, and ultimately,
reduction in fertility.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#27:1>
Within publicly-supported programs, both clinic and community-based,
it is likely that improvements in the quality of services will result in
greater initial acceptance and more sustained use.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#28:1>
Speculating more broadly and in simplistic terms about the societal
impacts of improved care in Asia, Bruce averred that it is the inadequacies
in the array of services, and not contraceptive supply, that constrain
expanded use of contraceptives and further reductions in fertility.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#29:1>
Beyond the global hypothesis that improvements in the quality of care
are essential from human rights and demographic perspectives, she posited
that the largest potential reward for improving services exists where
societal demand for child spacing and fertility regulation is low or
unsteady, and as a corollary, where maternal and child health is poor. <fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#30:1>
<h> <bold> Quality of Care Defined </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#31:1>
Donabedian ( 1980), the leading expert in modern quality
assurance, formulated the classic definition of quality of care as <quote>
&ldquo; that kind of care which is expected to maximize an inclusive measure
of client welfare, after one has taken account of the balance expected of
gains and losses that attend the process of care in all its parts. &rdquo;
</quote> <fnr> <sp> 3 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#32:1>
High quality of health care traditionally consists of a scientific or
technical component and an interpersonal element that together enables the
client to attain the highest possible functional state and psychological
result.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#33:1>
As such, quality is determined by three factors: the user of the
service ( or client), the provider of the service ( or staff member), and the
organization that provides the structure in which the staff operate. <fnr>
<sp> 4 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#34:1>
Bruce pointed that the word <mention> quality </mention> and its
imputed meaning have emerged in contradictory contexts; early family planning
literature discussed quality largely in relation to clinical operations to
the neglect of the interpersonal dimensions of care, suggesting that high
quality meant technically sophisticated, expensive equipment.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#35:1>
Previous perceptions counted availability and/or accessibility of
contraceptives as synonymous to quality considered as vital determinants of
contraceptive use. <fnr> <sp> 5 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#36:1>
Bair ( 1987) defined quality in terms of potential demographic impact
such as the proportion of women using long-term methods as a measure of
family planning service quality. <fnr> <sp> 6 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#37:1>
Roemer and Montoya Aguilar ( 1988) viewed it from the perspective of
actions as the proper performance ( according to standards) of interventions
that are known to be safe, affordable, and able to produce the desired impact
on fertility. <fnr> <sp> 7 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#38:1>
Leebov ( 1991) expanded the definition considerably by elaborating on
the slogan <quote> &ldquo; doing the right things right &rdquo; </quote> to
mean obtaining the best possible outcomes ( fertility reduction, usage of
effective methods, high continuation rates); satisfying all clients; and
retaining competent staff. <fnr> <sp> 8 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#39:1>
<h> <bold> Quality of Care Framework </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#40:1>
Bruce presented the six salient elements of family planning
programs which constitute quality, namely: choice of methods, information
given to clients, technical competence, interpersonal relations, follow-up
continuity mechanisms, and appropriate constellation of services.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#41:1>
As such, the framework provides an ordered point of departure from
which to develop a description of the service unit and define its quality.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#42:1>
Figure 1 graphically presents the framework with the three broad
headings: program effort, quality of the service experience, and its impacts.
<fnr> <sp> 9 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#43:1>
Choice of methods pertains to the number of contraceptive methods
offered on a reliable basis and their inherent variations.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#44:1>
The degree to which the needs of specific subgroups ( adolescents,
pre-menopausal, spacers, lactating) are addressed and the choices given to
clients are considered significant.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#45:1>
The information provided during the interaction between the provider
and the client includes the range of methods available, the
contraindications, advantages, details on the use of method, impacts on
sexual practice, potential side effects, support and referral.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#46:1>
<mention> Technical competence </mention> means the capability of the
provider to adhere to the standards that the specific technique requires, the
observance of protocols, and asepsis required for specific clinical methods.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#47:1>
<mention> Interpersonal relations </mention> refer to the human
dimension of the services such as quality of relationship between the
providers and clients as well as the degree of concern for the clients '
welfare.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#48:1>
Mechanisms to encourage continuity include referral, identification
of supply source, and follow-up plans either through forward appointments or
home visits.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#49:1>
The constellation of services to the related programs - - MCH,
postpartum care, or reproductive health - - situate family planning within a
comprehensive health framework. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#50:1>
<h> <bold> The Philippine Family Planning Program </bold> </h> <fnr>
<sp> 10 </sp> </fnr>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#51:1>
The Philippine Family Planning Program ( PFPP) recognizes that
the aggregation of individuals ' and couples ' decisions and action has an
impact on overall fertility and population growth.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#52:1>
It regards this summation as a separate issue altogether distinct
from the principal program focus of assisting couples for their own benefit
according to their aspirations.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#53:1>
The program intends to respond to the household demand for
information and services relative to family planning on the assumption that
the satisfaction of individual couples would also mean the achievement of
overall fertility reduction goals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#54:1>
The Program defines the demand for family planning in two ways: (
a) in terms of the expressed desire of couples to space or limit their
children for a variety of reasons; and ( b) the need to reduce the identified
risks to the health of mothers and children due to pregnancy and childbirth.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#55:1>
The Program regards demand on the basis of the couple 's fertility
aspirations and health needs.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#56:1>
Thus, it seeks to meet the demand for information and services by
those who want to practice family planning because they prefer wider child
spacing or smaller families, and also by those who may need to practice
because pregnancy and childbirth pose higher risks than they may be willing
to bear. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#57:1>
<h> <bold> Emphasis on Service Quality </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#58:1>
The Program relies on voluntary acceptance and compliance among
service users.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#59:1>
In order to maximize efficiency and effectiveness in supporting
couples ' choice, the Program emphasizes service quality as a means to expand
initial use by those who want and need these services, and continuing use by
those who initiate practice. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#60:1>
Service quality in family planning includes: ( a) assurance of
safety in methods and supplies utilized in the program; ( b) cost-efficient
coverage of service outlets in terms of physical reach and financial
considerations; ( c) reliable links with associated maternal and child care
services necessary for women of reproductive age contemplating the prospects
of pregnancy and childbirth; ( d) availability of a range of choice
appropriate for various reasons and circumstances; ( e) correctness and
completeness of information provided to potential acceptors; ( f) adequate
support for continuation of practice by those acceptors who wish to do so; (
g) regular, predictable, standardized, pleasant, and supportive clinic
services; and ( i) priority provision for rural couples with low education
and income. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#61:1>
The revitalization of the family planning service delivery
network is largely built on improving service quality along the lines
described above.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#62:1>
The planning, organizing, budgeting, logistics, monitoring, and
evaluation functions are undertaken for the purpose of assuring service
quality.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#63:1>
The impact of improvements is measured in terms of utilization of
services by new acceptors and continuing users. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#64:1>
<h> <bold> Decentralized Service Delivery at the Department of Health
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#65:1>
To effectively become demand-driven and quality-conscious, the
Program is decentralized in terms of service delivery.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#66:1>
Central control is exercised through: ( a) clear policy articulation
after broad consultation; ( b) nationally-organized logistics support system;
( c) standard reporting and evaluation; and ( d) national planning of
information, education and communication ( IEC), training, clinical
standards; and other technically-determined functions.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#67:1>
Actual management of service outlets and implementation of service
programs through each participating organization are likewise decentralized.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#68:1>
Thus, the tasks of demand estimation, client identification and
prioritization, establishment of outlets, upgrading or expansion of outlets,
conduct of training, execution of IEC plans, clinic operation, area
coordination, and other services are undertaken at each locality via an
appropriate regional, provincial, district, municipal or <indig> barangay
</indig> mechanism following the administrative structure of the Department
of Health ( DOH). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#69:1>
In addition, as the overall decentralization of government
proceeds and as local governments take on roles in the Program, the service
delivery maximizes linkages with local governments at the provincial,
municipal, and <indig> barangay </indig> levels. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#70:1>
<h> <bold> Service Content of the Programs </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#71:1>
The Program provides information and services.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#72:1>
Information consists of factual explanations of health and other
benefits of family planning, descriptions of various family planning methods
included in the Program, and other materials that couples need to make fully
informed choices.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#73:1>
It also provides motivational materials to enable couples to explore
reasons and options for responsible parenthood.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#74:1>
Furthermore, the Program provides specific information to allow
couples to take steps to seek out and obtain services. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#75:1>
The Program makes available modern contraceptive methods, as well
as information on other ways of managing fertility such as natural family
planning and breastfeeding.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#76:1>
The current methods available are low dose combination pills,
intrauterine devices ( IUD), male or female voluntary surgical contraception,
condoms, and natural family planning ( NFP).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#77:1>
The Program provides an adequate range of choices on an area-wide
basis even as each outlet may opt to specialize in one or a few methods.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#78:1>
In the provision of services, the choice made by the client is the
principal consideration.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#79:1>
There is no coercion in behalf of family planning or any specific
method.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#80:1>
Providers are required to advise and recommend, and care is always
taken to avoid misinformation or any action that could compromise the clients '
right to a free and informed choice in managing their reproductive lives.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#81:1>
All supplies and techniques provided under the Program are
controlled for safety and quality.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#82:1>
No special accommodation or compromise is made that deviates from
normal prudent practice for accepting and utilizing contraceptive supplies in
the Program.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#83:1>
Since all program procedures are elective, patient safety is
pre-eminent.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#84:1>
New methods are thoroughly considered, studied, evaluated, and
tested, prior to inclusion in the Program. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#85:1>
Method shifting on the part of program acceptors is fully
supported.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#86:1>
Program dropouts are given due attention by responding to their
family planning needs or supporting them in their chosen pregnancy and
childbirth.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-012#87:1>
While the Program emphasizes client satisfaction in one or some other
chosen methods, the DOH continues to make its other health services equally
available to clients who have chosen pregnancy and childbirth. </p> </I>
