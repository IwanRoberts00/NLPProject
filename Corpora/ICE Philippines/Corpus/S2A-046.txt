 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#1:1:A>
Thank you Owen that 's a funny name for a for a girl <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#3:1:A>
I 'm not used to using the podium so I hope you don't mind if I just move this aside
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#4:1:A>
Can I sit down
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#5:1:A>
Okay uhm
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#6:1:A>
First and foremost I 'd like to thank uh the organizers of this activity
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#7:1:A>
It 's an <.> alter </.> alternative class program
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#8:1:A>
It 's uh interesting to note that uh despite the fact that you have your classes you uh put put aside <indig> 'no </indig> your regular academic uh requirements at least for an hour and a half in order to come up with discussions on issues that are not necessarily well academically <.> rel </.> you know uh <.> incli </.> uh what do you call it are not necessarily academic in nature
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#9:1:A>
I 've always believed that uh you should not let your academics interfere with your education
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#10:1:A>
In other words uhm education is not limited to the four walls of your classroom
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#11:1:A>
I suppose many of you know this
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#12:1:A>
But then we are in another classroom but this time we 'll be we will be discussing the First Quarter Storm as was requested by the organizers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#13:1:A>
What is the First Quarter Storm
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#14:1:A>
Does anybody have an idea
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#15:1:A>
It happened some twenty-two years ago most of you were not born yet
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#16:1:A>
I was still in I wasn't even in elementary
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#17:1:A>
I 'm still young but I 'm not as young as you are
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#18:1:A>
So so don't don't think that I belong to the the era of the First Quarter Storm <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#19:1:A>
No I don't
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#20:1:A>
If at all my only recollection of the First Quarter Storm is that we used to live in U P Village and that 's uh very lose to the U P Diliman campus
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#21:1:A>
And I was playing in our in our garden and all of a sudden I smelled tear gas
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#22:1:A>
And we all ran to the house <.> cry </.> we were all crying at least we were four or five because of the tear gas and we were wondering what the hell that was
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#23:1:A>
Of course nobody told us that uh U P the U P Diliman campus was in fact invaded because of the Diliman commune anybody familiar with the Diliman commune
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#25:1:A>
Well the students decided to take over the university after a five centavo increase in uh in transport rates were hiked <indig> 'no </indig> were raised uh were imposed by the government
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#26:1:A>
You can imagine how volatile the situation was
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#27:1:A>
But that was one part of the First Quarter Storm
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#28:1:A>
What is the First Quarter Storm
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#29:1:A>
Well twenty-two years ago at uh this time there were massive mobilization there were several mobilizations <indig> 'no </indig> massive mobilizations of students and youth marching in the streets calling for radical reforms and changes in our country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#30:1:A>
That was around twenty-two years ago from January to around March wave after wave of student protests engulfed the entire country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#31:1:A>
Leaders like Edgardo Jocson Nilo Tayag uhm Chito Santa Romana Ericson Baculinao uh student leaders were actually marching in the streets calling for reforms in the country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#32:1:A>
That was twenty-two years ago
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#33:1:A>
Some of you are probably asking what so what <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#34:1:A>
So they were marching in the streets and uh that 's good or is it good
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#35:1:A>
Why discuss the First Quarter Storm in the first place
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#36:1:A>
Why are we here discussing it today after twenty-two years 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#37:1:A>
Well <,> you it will be a surprise to some of you perhaps many of you are also familiar with it and I suppose many will agree when I say that reforms are still very much necessary even up until today
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#38:1:A>
The problems of poverty the problems of social inequality the problems of social unrest or the roots of social unrest which were actually the uh reasons for the mobilizations some twenty-two years ago they still exist today
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#39:1:A>
Except that perhaps there are some uh qualitative changes in terms of population in terms of gravity of the problem or incidence of poverty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#40:1:A>
But the reason why students marched in the streets over two decades ago and the reasons for poverty and hunger and unemployment that that exists today are very much the same <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#41:1:A>
<indig> Naroroon pa rin </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#42:1:A>
<indig> Naroon pa rin 'yung usapin ng kagutuman naroon pa rin ang usapin ng kawalan ng hanapbuhay </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#43:1:A>
<indig> Ngunit 'yung </indig> First Quarter Storm <indig> ang namuno nu'n ang mga mag-aaral ang mga estudyante </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#44:1:A>
I suppose none of you will debate with me when I say that our country is in a rut right
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#46:1:A>
I mean we have problems right grave problems
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#49:1:A>
Poverty incidence is seventy percent <.> seven </.> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#50:1:A>
What does poverty incidence mean
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#51:1:A>
What does that mean <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#52:1:A>
You have to earn something like four thousand pesos uh uh monthly and you still belong to the poverty line
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#53:1:A>
And the minimum wage is way way below the poverty threshold
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#54:1:A>
In other words the workers and the professionals at least as far as minimum wage is concerned will have to work two days in order to be able to feed an average family of six for one day 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#55:1:A>
Because as far as NEDA is concerned I think the minimum wage is one hundred uh eighteen uhm right one hundred eighteen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#57:1:A>
During my time five years ago it was only sixty-four <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#58:1:A>
But then NEDA says that for an average family of six in order to provide for the basic the must basic of needs food shelter clothing he has the family must earn something like two hundred forty to two hundred sixty pesos a <.> mon </.> uh a day
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#59:1:A>
So that 's where we are now
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#60:1:A>
The uh <foreign> per capita </foreign> income of uh the Philippines if you are to compare it to other countries in Asia ours is something like seven hundred dollars per capita
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#61:1:A>
Hong Kong is something like eleven hundred dollars
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#62:1:A>
China is something like uh no I I stand corrected uh
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#63:1:A>
Taiwan and uh Japan Japan is something like twenty-three thousand <foreign> per capita </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#64:1:A>
So you can imagine how 's how far behind we are
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#65:1:A>
Uhm Indonesia is something like five hundred
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#66:1:A>
And uh Bangkok is something like eleven hundred <,> <indig> 'no </indig> much higher than four hundred dollars higher than our <foreign> per capita </foreign> income
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#67:1:A>
And that 's already Malaysia Malaysia too <indig> 'no </indig> around thirteen hundred
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#68:1:A>
We are lagging far far behind
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#69:1:A>
In nineteen sixty-two we were only second to Japan in terms of uh development
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#70:1:A>
Today we 're second to Bangladesh in terms of underdevelopment <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#71:1:A>
Many of you are perhaps familiar with the power shortage at least in Mindanao we 've we read about it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#72:1:A>
The water shortage which we expect in uh the summer months
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#73:1:A>
The power rates are being increased <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#74:1:A>
The incidence of violence is also a a a concern
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#75:1:A>
Perhaps some of you are familiar with C P Lopez who was a student here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#76:1:A>
Maureen Hultman is another
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#77:1:A>
Uhm Leny Villa
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#78:1:A>
The incidence of violence and the victims of lawlessness and violence in our country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#79:1:A>
On a daily basis kidnapping has been has been uh is already syndicated
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#80:1:A>
Eldon Maguan was shot dead simply because he couldn't back out his car
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#81:1:A>
And most of them if you will notice most of the victims are are from our ranks from the youth
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#82:1:A>
There is still social unrest very much even in the countryside
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#83:1:A>
The insurgency continues to take its heavy toll on our people Marag Valley for example
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#85:1:A>
There are problems in our country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#86:1:A>
There are grave problems in our country and we are in the process of trying to I hope formulate solutions to these problems
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#87:1:A>
The I M F World Bank continues to burden us with a foreign debt service uh agreement that allows for close to both local and foreign debt close to around forty percent of our national budget goes to debt service both local and foreign
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#88:1:A>
But they say that the local debt ballooned because of the need to service our foreign debt
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#89:1:A>
So forty percent of your one peso instead of buying food instead of buying medicines instead of buying the necessary needs the necessary the basic needs of our people we have to pay debt service
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#90:1:A>
Tough luck for those who cannot afford medicines and they happen to be the majority in our country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#91:1:A>
The incidence of poverty when you say poverty incidence there are three factors <indig> 'no </indig> indicators
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#92:1:A>
Seventy percent of the of our people live below the poverty line
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#93:1:A>
And there are three indicators of what the poverty line is
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#94:1:A>
One you can only afford two square meals a day
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#95:1:A>
Two if you get sick you cannot afford medicines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#96:1:A>
And three two changes of clothing in a week <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#97:1:A>
That uh <.> indic </.> these are indicators of the poverty line and <,> more than half of our population find themselves in such a situation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#98:1:A>
Not to mention of course the fact that many of our people the unemployment rate is so high I think the underemployment rate is something like thirty-five percent and the unemployment rate is somewhere between ten to fifteen percent
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#100:1:A>
It 's no wonder why most of our people have to go abroad to find work there
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#101:1:A>
They end up becoming prostitutes in Japan chambermaids in Singapore house domestic help in Malaysia and contract workers in Saudi Arabia
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#102:1:A>
I mean why is this
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#103:1:A>
This is this happens because our economy is unable to provide for necessary employment and the decent wages
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#104:1:A>
And hence our people have to go abroad have to be separated from their families and have to be subjected to the most cruel and inhuman conditions in certain areas
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#105:1:A>
Of course to us the youth what the hell do we care
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#106:1:A>
For studying we hope to get a good job especially D L S U if you are a graduate of D L S U it 's you know it 's like a ticket to I don't know where <O> laughter </O> a ticket to a a a good paying job in a multinational corporation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#109:1:A>
We are students we are reviewing we go through our daily work daily homework daily assignments
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#110:1:A>
But the situation in the country is there too
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#111:1:A>
Environment I failed to mention the environment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#112:1:A>
Perhaps some of us are familiar with the massive destruction of our forests
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#113:1:A>
If we continue to log the way we 're logging today by the year two thousand virgin our virgin forest cover will be gone
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#114:1:A>
A friend of mine took a trip to Isabela Cagayan the Cagayan province in Isabela province rather
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#115:1:A>
From here Manila up to Isabela is something like eight hours
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#116:1:A>
And he counted the number of trucks that were covered with uh what do you call it <indig> 'yung </indig> canvas <indig> 'yung </indig> illegal logs <,> for eight hours
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#117:1:A>
He counted just one day and that 's the average on a daily basis
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#118:1:A>
Who can give us a guess as to how many trucks
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#119:1:A>
Hundred twenty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#120:1:A>
Hundred
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#121:1:A>
He counted hundred eighty-seven trucks <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#122:1:A>
That 's on a daily basis
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#123:1:A>
The movement which I had which was mentioned earlier National Movement of Young Legislators we are a an organization of city municipal and provincial uh elected officials who are all young who are to a certain degree idealistic <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#124:1:A>
Isabela our regional assembly in Isabela came up with a position for total log ban
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#125:1:A>
Two days after they received candles telling them not to interfere in the logging that is being undertaken in their province
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#126:1:A>
It was a death threat
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#127:1:A>
Each of them received uh a a candle
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#128:1:A>
I don't know how big the candle was but it was a candle
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#129:1:A>
But the level of of destruction in our environment is so great that we might end up in an uninhabitable hell in the future
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#130:1:A>
The present generation does not really benefit much or will not really be affected much because in fifteen twenty years they will not be here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#131:1:A>
But we will
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#132:1:A>
And we will be here inheriting whatever is left of the continuing destruction of our environment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#133:1:A>
The pollution in Metro Manila is two hundred percent more uh is higher than the acceptable world standards
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#134:1:A>
So of course many of us go home in our air-conditioned cars
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#135:1:A>
We 're not familiar with the pollution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#136:1:A>
Why don't you try it one day
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#137:1:A>
<indig> Buksan n'yo </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#138:1:A>
And others of course who take the jeep would know this
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#139:1:A>
Once you get to your house you clean your nose you know you think gosh where did all that black particles come from
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#140:1:A>
But that 's pollution for you
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#141:1:A>
Anyway all these problems we encounter
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#142:1:A>
Some of us are perhaps more familiar to this <.> pro </.> about these problems than others
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#143:1:A>
The question is the First Quarter Storm was in fact a mobilization of students and youth in order to address societal ills the ills the problems of the country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#145:1:A>
Who here would say that our country is is in a heavenly position
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#146:1:A>
I I suppose no one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#147:1:A>
But who here is willing to really act on the problems
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#148:1:A>
Many of us will say as students and I 'm a student too yeah right
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-046#150:1:A>
I 'm a student too I 'm just on leave <indig> 'no </indig> but I have eighteen units more to go 

 </I>
