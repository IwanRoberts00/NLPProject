<I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#1:1:A>
Yes

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#2:1:B>
Chapter eleven
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#3:1:B>
We should start with chapter eleven

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#4:1:A>
We start with

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#5:1:B>
Chapter eleven

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#6:1:A>
Chapter eleven
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#7:1:A>
You if you remember when we took up chapter nine we left out the last part of the discussion <,> which was on bureaucracy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#8:1:A>
You remember
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#9:1:A>
Okay we did not discuss bureaucracy because bureaucracy is a topic that is to be covered with the other institutions
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#10:1:A>
Now after chapter nine we took up chapter ten which is on family
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#11:1:A>
And family is not a bureaucracy okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#12:1:A>
So before we go to the study of chapter eleven on religion let us go back to chapter nine that aspect on bureaucracy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#13:1:A>
And take a look at what that is so that we can by the way because somebody 's taping the session you don't have a quiz

 <$Z> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#14:1:Z> <X> Yehey </X> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#15:1:A>
<&> teacher addresses the one taping the session </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#16:1:A>
You wanted me to conduct the lecture rather than have uh <indig> sige </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#17:1:A>
Okay

 <$Z> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#18:1:Z> <X> Yehey </X> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#19:1:A>
But you have to talk louder so your your voice can get recorded <&> students make noise </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#20:1:A>
Okay so uh what we are going to take up before <,> discussing religion <,> is the subject of bureaucracy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#21:1:A>
Mitch do you want to start
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#22:1:A>
Uh <.> o </.> <indig> ako pala ano teka muna </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#23:1:A>
I 'll have to discuss it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#24:1:A>
So what do we mean by <mention> bureaucracy </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#25:1:A>
What do we mean by <mention> bureaucracy </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#26:1:A>
Don't you have anything to say about <mention> bureaucracy </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#27:1:A>
What what do you know about <mention> bureaucracy </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#28:1:A>
Anna

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#29:1:C>
A hierarchy of of jobs or tasks

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#30:1:A>
Now from your understanding from your familiarity with the term what does <mention> bureaucracy </mention> in a sense uh uh make you think of

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#31:1:D>
<mention> Red tape </mention> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#32:1:A>
<mention> Red tape </mention> okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#33:1:A>
What else

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#34:1:E>
Checks and balances

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#35:1:A>
<mention> Red tape </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#36:1:A>
Just what is <mention> red tape </mention> 

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#37:1:F>
When it is when one person goes to another to an official and then <unclear> words </unclear> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#38:1:A>
One person goes to an official

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#39:1:F>
A person who needs something let 's say in an organization he 's asked to go to an official and then he 's asked to go to a higher official and it goes on and on and <unclear> words </unclear> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#40:1:A>
Uh-huh
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#41:1:A>
Any other idea
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#42:1:A>
Edwin
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#43:1:A>
<mention> Red tape </mention> 

 <$G> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#44:1:G>
<unclear> words </unclear> the long process of a person trying to ask a favor from an institution

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#45:1:A>
A long process <,> involving request for favor from an institution
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#46:1:A>
What about it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#47:1:A>
When does it become <mention> red tape </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#48:1:A>
Does just having a long process uh make it <mention> red tape </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#49:1:A>
Analie

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#50:1:H>
I think <mention> red tape </mention> is a kind of hindrance that

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#51:1:A>
Uh-huh

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#52:1:H>
Makes uh a process which is supposed to be this this short

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#53:1:A>
Yes <{> <[> uh-huh </[> 

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#54:1:H>
<[> Long </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#55:1:A>
Okay so the idea is there
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#56:1:A>
What else can we say about <mention> bureaucracy </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#57:1:A>
From your own familiarity with the term
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#58:1:A>
You don't you 've met the word <mention> bureaucracy </mention> okay so that brings to mind uh implies <mention> red tape </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#59:1:A>
Another Wilson

 <$I> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#60:1:I>
Uhm <mention> bureaucracy </mention> is a system uh if an in an organization which is supposed to make a process more efficient but in many cases it makes it even more inefficient

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#61:1:A>
<mention> Bureaucracy </mention> you say is a system
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#62:1:A>
Okay what is in that system
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#63:1:A>
Ramon

 <$J> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#64:1:J>
System of checks and balances

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#65:1:A>
Well let 's say uh you 're talking about the system here
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#66:1:A>
Presence of procedures you 're referring to the existence of rules regulations uhm
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#67:1:A>
What else
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#68:1:A>
Let 's take a look at what <mention> bureaucracy </mention> is really
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#69:1:A>
It is defined as what
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#70:1:A>
It refers to <&> students answer in chorus but answer is inaudible </&> okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#71:1:A>
It talks about a particular system but that system refers to a hierarchy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#72:1:A>
Of what
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#73:1:A>
A hierarchy of positions <,> in a large usually when we talk about large organizations this is a secondary group setting <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#74:1:A>
A large organization which makes possible <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#75:1:A>
What <,,> 

 <$K> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#76:1:K>
The performance uh the performance of certain tasks

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#77:1:A>
Okay which makes it possible for the institution or the organization to perform its tasks and functions
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#78:1:A>
Okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#79:1:A>
So look <,> it refers to that hierarchy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#80:1:A>
And by hierarchy you 're thinking about what
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#81:1:A>
What comes to mind
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#82:1:A>
What does the word brings to mind <&> students answer </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#83:1:A>
Pyramidal
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#84:1:A>
That means what
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#85:1:A>
Does it always have to be pyramidal
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#86:1:A>
It brings to mind layers
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#87:1:A>
It brings to mind what

 <$Z> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#88:1:Z> <X> <&> students answer in chorus </&> Levels </X> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#89:1:A>
Levels more appropriately ranking <indig> di ba </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#90:1:A>
<indig> May mataas may mababa </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#91:1:A>
So ranking
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#92:1:A>
There are people at the top and people at the bottom
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#93:1:A>
Excuse me we have to end this <&> break in the recording </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#94:1:A>
What transpired before you because we will use that to discuss when we talk about politics and education
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#95:1:A>
Okay so let 's go back to what we were discussing
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#96:1:A>
Uhm when you when you talk about bureaucracy you 're actually referring to what
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#97:1:A>
A hierarchy of positions in a large secondary organization which makes sure that the tasks and function of that organization are accomplished
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#98:1:A>
Okay now when you talk about hierarchy you imply ranking
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#99:1:A>
There are people at the top all the way down to the bottom and all these people are necessary to make this organization run or function
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#100:1:A>
Now uh that is why uh I suppose it will be very easy for you now to connect the existence of a hierarchy the presence of what
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#101:1:A>
Different kinds of people running the organization and the necessity for procedures rules and regulations to make the entire organization run smoothly
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#102:1:A>
As a result of this need the presence of the hierarchy uh to ensure that the organization runs smoothly you may encounter certain problems
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#103:1:A>
That 's why one of the problems you have encountered is what we call <mention> red tape </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#104:1:A>
Isn't that uh uh a fact that if you have a large the larger the organization what have you learned
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#105:1:A>
The larger the organization <,> the

 <$Z> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#106:1:Z> <X> <&> students answer in chorus </&> More complex </X> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#107:1:A>
Of course the more complex <,> the more important it is to make sure that each member of that organization knows what he or she is supposed to do
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#108:1:A>
Isn't that right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#109:1:A>
Okay so therefore you must have what
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#110:1:A>
Systems <,> systems
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#111:1:A>
You must install systems so that this organization will be able to operate smoothly <,> efficiently <,> effectively
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#112:1:A>
If it 's an organization that is uh what
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#113:1:A>
Whose goal is to <,> deliver services <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#114:1:A>
The services have to be <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#115:1:A>
What is the test of the performance of the organization the <,> what
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#116:1:A>
The results or the <.> act </.> 

 <$?> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#117:1:?> Performance

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#118:1:A>
That services are actually delivered to communities that it 's supposed to serve
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#119:1:A>
How do you do that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#120:1:A>
If you do not ensure a smooth flow of operations so they would like to be efficient they would like to be effective so you they set up what
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#121:1:A>
Systems
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#122:1:A>
Systems of procedures okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#123:1:A>
Systems involving procedures involving rules how to how to
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#124:1:A>
Now when they do that what happens is <.> i </.> it 's really for this purpose
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#125:1:A>
The objectives are noble <indig> di ba </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#126:1:A>
They want to deliver in that that example that we presented
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#127:1:A>
Let 's say the what I mean <indig> ano </indig> a department a government uh uh agency Department of Transportation for example or a department for social services <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#128:1:A>
So what happens is they want to deliver
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#129:1:A>
They want to perform well so they want to deliver what they 're supposed to deliver
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#130:1:A>
Now uhm <,> in the interest of performing well what happens is they become <.> fle </.> uhm inflexible
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#131:1:A>
You have set up systems and procedures right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#132:1:A>
Now people follow that to the letter
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#133:1:A>
So what happens is you have inflexibility okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#134:1:A>
And what happens is because this is a large organization with a lot of people with a lot of functions what happens is the procedures become long-winded right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#135:1:A>
That 's why you are referring to <mention> red tape </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#136:1:A>
<indig> Parang matagal bago magawa ang isang bagay </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#137:1:A>
Take a look at something you are following up uh what we call <mention> paper-chase </mention> in government
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#138:1:A>
Not only government
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#139:1:A>
Educational systems all of the other institutions from religion
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#140:1:A>
So you have next education the economy and the political institutions
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#141:1:A>
All of these are what <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#142:1:A>
Large organizations or involves excuse me all of them involve large organizations which tend to become if they are not already <,> what
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#143:1:A>
Bureaucracies
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#144:1:A>
Okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#145:1:A>
So all of them would have problems like this
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#146:1:A>
Problems of wanting to perform well and as a result <,> encountering other problems like inflexibility
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#147:1:A>
So they 're so inflexible such that what do we what do we see in in in the case of processing papers
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#148:1:A>
If the a certain person it 's like if this is your <.> pi </.> piece of paper and the routes for this paper is from person A to B to C to D before it goes out again to you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#149:1:A>
<indig> Di ba </indig> okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#150:1:A>
So <mention> paper in paper out </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#151:1:A>
What are the stages or the routes that are taken by this paper
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#152:1:A>
A person A B C D what happens
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#153:1:A>
What happens in actual situation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#154:1:A>
These these are only four people usual or these these might be four persons or four offices or four units or four departments okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#155:1:A>
Now what happens
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#156:1:A>
If there are departments to go to it would be more awful because there are people in the departments who take charge of that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#157:1:A>
There are two or three persons in a department in a unit uh who have to take charge of that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#158:1:A>
What is going to happen to the process
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#159:1:A>
It will be lengthier longer right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#160:1:A>
<indig> Kaya sinasabi natin </indig> red tape <indig> di ba </indig> okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#161:1:A>
Now what happens when when this piece of paper goes to A and if let us say A is not there

 <$?> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#162:1:?> The whole system is held up

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#163:1:A>
Okay 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#164:1:A>
The whole the processing is held up or delayed
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#165:1:A>
So you have to wait for A
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#166:1:A>
And sometimes the inflexibility can be carried to such an extent that nobody else takes the place of A
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#167:1:A>
So if A is on vacation for two weeks you 'll have to return maybe two weeks uh you 'll have to give two weeks more to the processing
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#168:1:A>
If it will take a matter of one week for <mention> paper in </mention> to <mention> paper out </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#169:1:A>
What happens
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#170:1:A>
A will have to be out for two weeks and the the paper cannot move from A to B because A is absent so you 'll have to be to add one week of processing plus two weeks of absence by A so you have to have three weeks
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#171:1:A>
So it 's longer
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#172:1:A>
It takes longer
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#173:1:A>
Now why does this happen
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#174:1:A>
Because you have what
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#175:1:A>
Very clear-cut procedures
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#176:1:A>
Only A can sign
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#177:1:A>
Something like that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#178:1:A>
What is that for
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#179:1:A>
Perhaps it is to meet another objective of the organization which is to make sure that things are done in proper

 <$?> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#180:1:?> Order

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#181:1:A>
Order
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#182:1:A>
Proper systems
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#183:1:A>
So you have a system of check and balance
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#184:1:A>
<indig> Hindi puwede na hindi dumaan dito </indig> for some kind of <,> what
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#185:1:A>
Approval <,> sanction okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#186:1:A>
So you have uh a very long-winded process resulting from this particular instance
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#187:1:A>
So we talk about what
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#188:1:A>
In the bureaucracy you have red tapes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#189:1:A>
In the bureaucracy the bureaucracy becomes so inflexible <,> okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#190:1:A>
If the person is not there nobody else can take his place
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#191:1:A>
So the system gets derailed or gets delayed is held up okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#192:1:A>
Now isn't that what we experienced
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#193:1:A>
Take a look
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#194:1:A>
Why why do we say that this is true even in religion
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#195:1:A>
Take a look at our Catholic Church which is one big what

 <$?> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#196:1:?> Bureaucracy

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#197:1:A>
Yes bureaucracy organization in the religious institution
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#198:1:A>
There are many others
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#199:1:A>
I suppose every other church organization would qualify as a bureaucracy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#200:1:A>
The <indig> Iglesia ni Kristo </indig> is another big bureaucracy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#201:1:A>
The different Protestant churches would be bureaucracies in their own right <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#202:1:A>
So take a look at positions even
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#203:1:A>
What did I say the other time
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-013#204:1:A>
Did I mention this about even in the in the heavens you have a hierarchy
