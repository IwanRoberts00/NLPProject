<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#20:1:B>
I was able to present only about half of of all the slides
that I prepared

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#21:1:A>
Oh really

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#22:1:B>
And you know the L C D didn’t work

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#23:1:B>
You know you really can’t count on these I T gadgets and all these

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#28:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#30:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> true true

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#31:1:B>
But at least they enjoyed

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#32:1:B>
They enjoyed the presentation I guess

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#33:1:B>

And no English films being shown

<$A>

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#64:1:B>
<indig> Ha </indig>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#65:1:B>
So of course I wouldn’t watch Volta or whatever

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#66:1:A>
<O> chuckle </O> But I heard it 's the top grosser so far

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#67:1:B>
Which one Volta

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#68:1:A>
Yeah Volta

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#69:1:B>
Oh <,> okay so pathetic

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#70:1:B>
Anyway uhm <,> hey uhm speaking about films which reminds me you
know what I I where where did I see that

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#71:1:B>
I think it 's in the internet I I I read something like a review of
the Troy the movie

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#72:1:B>
Remember that Brad Pitt Troy

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#73:1:A>
Yeah yeah I 've watched it too

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#74:1:B>
Oh but of course

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#75:1:B>
I was a bit confused with the you know uhm the introduction or
something about Troy actually the background

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#76:1:B>
Perhaps you can shed light you know you 're the authority here when
it comes to literature

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#77:1:A>
Uh-hmmmh

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#78:1:B>
Uh-hmmmh uh

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#79:1:A>
Well actually that movie is a compressed version of different
literary works

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#80:1:B>
What what different

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#81:1:B>
You mean it was not only based from Iliad

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#82:1:A>
No the Iliad talks about the tenth year of the war up to the
death of Hector

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#83:1:B>
Oh oh

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#84:1:B>
That 's something new huh

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#85:1:A>
Oh yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#86:1:B>
Uh-huh

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#87:1:A>
But even prior to that there were already works that pertained
to the gods the goddesses and the heroes of Troy and Greece

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#88:1:B>
Uh-hmmmh uh-hmmmh

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#89:1:A>
Maybe what the producers of the movie Troy did was they
compressed everything into a single commercialized film with a romantic plot
and all the works

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#90:1:B>
Oh yes oh yes

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#91:1:A>
<unclear> words </unclear> to impress viewers so they would
enjoy it

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#92:1:B>
Uh-hmmmh uh-hmmmh

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#93:1:A>
And there were a lot of differences <{> <[> <unclear> words
</unclear> </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#94:1:B>
<[> Yeah actually </[> </{> there were a lot of what <,>
differences okay

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#95:1:B>
Well what I know only is the Iliad

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#96:1:B>
I I don’t know the one you were telling me is that it was based
from many works so aside from Iliad

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#97:1:A>
Uh-hmmmh

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#98:1:B>
Uhm so what there were there are some confusing parts there
like uh uh a lot of them were able to escape from Troy is that true

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#99:1:A>
No that 's not true because

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#100:1:B>
Isn’t it it 's only <.> Ae </.> what 's that Aeneas right

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#101:1:A>
Aeneas

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#102:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#103:1:A>
The father and his son were the only men who escaped from
Troy

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#104:1:B>
That 's according to Iliad

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#105:1:A>
No no not that 's not in the Iliad

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#106:1:B>
Uh-hmmmh

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#107:1:A>
The later work by a Greek poet

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#108:1:B>
Oh I see

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#109:1:B>
But according to Iliad it was only Aeneas who was able to escape
right

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#110:1:A>
Uh-huh

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#111:1:B>
Uh-huh

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#112:1:A>
The women they were the women they all became concubines of
the Greeks

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#113:1:B>
Oh Briseis

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#114:1:B>
Briseis became also a concubine you mean

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#115:1:A>
Briseis

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#116:1:B>
Briseis

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#117:1:A>
I forgot

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#118:1:B>
The love interest of of Achilles Achilles

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#119:1:A>
Uh

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#120:1:B>
Did she die <,> at the end I don’t remember anymore

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#121:1:B>
Uh Briseis

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#122:1:A>
In the movie she didn’t die

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#123:1:B>
Uh-hmmmh she escaped right

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#124:1:A>
Yeah she was able to escape <{> <[> <,> </[> the pillaging of
the <.> troo </.> of the Greeks

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#125:1:A>
But in the in Greek literature I forgot what happened to her

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#126:1:B>
<[> Uh-huh </[> </{>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#127:1:B>
Oh I see okay and what what else

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#128:1:B>
Uhm who who is now the character of Legolas

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#129:1:B>
What was the character being

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#130:1:A>
Paris

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#131:1:B>
Paris Paris what about Paris

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#132:1:B>
Wasn’t that the start actually the start of the Troy like uhm of
course he abducted Helen right

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#133:1:A>
He abducted Helen and uh took her to Troy

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#134:1:B>
Yeah

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#135:1:B>
Was it was it like that in in Iliad

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#136:1:A>
Yeah it was also like that

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#137:1:B>
No because in the film I remember in the film uh uh like uh
Paris and Helen were like romantically linked right

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#138:1:B>
But in the original version in Iliad Helen was actually given to
Paris as a gift

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#139:1:A>
Oh yeah <{> <[> by </[> Aphrodite

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#140:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#141:1:B>
By Aphrodite

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#142:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#143:1:B>
Okay or or what 's this it 's not actually a gift or a bribe
<,> for choosing her as the

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#144:1:A>
For choosing her as the most

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#145:1:B>
As the fairest woman

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#146:1:A>
Yeah her <unclear> words </unclear> Hera and Athena

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#147:1:B>
Yeah Athena

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#148:1:B>
But in the film okay uhm it it looks like Paris and Helen had what
had an affair an illicit affair and so

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#149:1:A>
Yeah because in the <,> in Greek literature when Paris came
to <,> Sparta

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#150:1:B>
Uh-huh

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#151:1:A>
Menelaus wasn’t there so he had the chance to abduct Helen

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#152:1:B>
Uh-hmmmh

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#153:1:A>
But in the movie he saw there Menelaus <{> <[> and Hector
</[>

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#154:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#155:1:A>
They were all in Sparta but actually it 's not true

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#156:1:B>
Oh

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#157:1:A>
It didn’t really happen

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#158:1:B>
Oh I see

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#159:1:B>
Okay uhm another part in the film that which I enjoyed not really
I enjoyed or which I remember

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#160:1:A>
Uh-hmmmh

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#161:1:B>
Based from the Iliad is the fight between Hector and Achilles

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#162:1:A>
Oh yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#163:1:B>
How did you find that

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#164:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#165:1:B>
That <{> <[> was sexy right </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#166:1:A>
<[> It 's a very realistic </[> </{> portrayal

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#167:1:B>
What about the what about the performance of Achilles there
like or or Achilles or he was he was kinda dancing

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#168:1:A>
Yeah they were like dancing flamingoes <O> chuckle </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#169:1:B>
Okay it was like what

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#170:1:A>
It was like a choreographed fight

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#171:1:B>
A choreographed fight

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#172:1:B>
I I was supposed to say that <quote> a choreographed fight
</quote>

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#173:1:A>
Uh-huh

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#174:1:B>
Uh-huh okay

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#175:1:B>
And then in the original version Achilles was supposed to drag the
body of Hector inside uh Troy right inside the walls of Troy right

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#176:1:A>
No it was uh when Patroclus was killed by Hector they created
a funeral pyre for him

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#177:1:B>
Uh-huh

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#178:1:A>
And then when Achilles killed Hector he dragged

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#179:1:B>
The body of

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#180:1:A>
The body to their camp to the Greek camp

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#181:1:B>
That 's already in the film but in the original version
around Troy

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#182:1:A>
No no not around Troy

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#183:1:B>
Around the walls

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#184:1:A>
Dragged Hector 's body around Patroclus ' funeral fire

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#185:1:B>
Oh I <{> <[> see </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#186:1:A>
<[> Funeral </[> </{> pyre for eleven days

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#187:1:B>
I see I see

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#188:1:B>
Okay uh-huh

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#189:1:B>
But originally I mean did the did the father of <,> Priam did King
Priam really retrieve the body of Hector in the original version

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#190:1:A>
He was able to go to the Greek camps because Hermes helped
them Hermes is the messenger of the gods

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#191:1:B>
Yeah yeah Hermes of course I remember

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#192:1:A>
Yeah he was able to cloak Priam

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#193:1:B>
Oh

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#194:1:A>
<?> Disguise him so </?> he was able to go to Achilles ' camp

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#195:1:B>
Uh-huh

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#196:1:A>
But in the movie the gods were absent none of them were there

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#197:1:B>
Yes yes yes which makes the movie realistic right

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#198:1:B>
Okay because there were no gods or or goddesses in the film right

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#199:1:B>
There <.> wa </.> there was a uh mention of it okay but just a
mention right

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#200:1:B>
They didn’t appear

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#201:1:A>
That 's the liberty of the director to do what he wants so
that the movie will be commercially viable

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#202:1:B>
Uh-hmmmh

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#203:1:B>
Oh true uhm okay so that 's all about Troy

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#204:1:B>
I 'm waiting actually for the Spiderman Two

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#205:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#234:1:B>
I still have to do a paper in Corpus

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#235:1:B>
Oh I can’t afford to read anymore Book Five of Harry Potter <{>
<[> although I really want to </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#236:1:A>
<[> So reading for you </[> </{> has become <{> <[> reading
</[> has become a luxury for you

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#237:1:B>
<[> Harry Potter is </[> </{>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#238:1:B>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#242:1:A>

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#244:1:A>
Uh-huh

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#245:1:B>
But when I 'm here in school or in the class oh I have to
check paper or read assignments or review or what do a paper oh or stuff like
those

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#246:1:A>
Well my friends also collect Harry Potter books and they
think they enjoy it

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#247:1:A>
I don’t know why because I haven’t read any <{> <[> of the Harry
Potter </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#248:1:B>
<[> I was telling </[> </{> you already to start reading them

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#249:1:A>
Maybe you can convince me to read them <unclear> words
</unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#250:1:B>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#251:1:B>
I 'm just telling you to start reading <O> laughter </O> okay

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#252:1:A>
I don’t know I can’t find any reason <{> <[> to read </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#253:1:B>
<[> You have to start </[> </{> with Harry Potter One

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#254:1:A>
What about the first book

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#255:1:B>
Or what you can do perhaps is to watch the film first

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#256:1:B>
I can lend you One and Two I have them with me One and Two the
film and then uh read Books One and Two and then you compare

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#257:1:B>
And you 'd love also Three Harry Potter Three

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#258:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#259:1:B>
The Harry Potter Four is already very thick

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#260:1:B>
<{> <[> But have you </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#261:1:A>

Harry Potter Two

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#262:1:B>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#263:1:A>
Yeah <{> <[> yeah </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#264:1:B>
<[> That 's still </[> </{> the best version of all uh in my
own perception

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#265:1:B>
The Harry Potter Two uhm not really the Three I hate it

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#266:1:A>
<{> <[> Uh-huh </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#267:1:B>
<[> The Three </[> </{> I think is the worst version

<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#268:1:B>
The Harry Potter One is still the best

<$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-100#269:1:A>
Uh-hmmmh

<$B>
