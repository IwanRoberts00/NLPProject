<ICE-PHI:W2D-010#2:1>
Persons considering intercountry adoption have a right to accurate
information about these adoptions and the process involved.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-010#3:1>
Such information will enable them to make informed decisions on
initiating and completing such an adoption, the kind of child/ren they can
best parent, and whether they are willing to make the lifetime commitment
which is required. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-010#4:1>
The Intercountry Adoption Board ( ICAB) is mandated by law (
Intercountry Adoption Law of 1995 or Republic Act 8043) to be the Central
Authority on matters relating to the foreign adoption placement of Filipino
children to applicants who are either former Filipinos or foreigners
permanently residing abroad.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-010#5:1>
The Intercountry Adoption ( ICA) Law stipulates certain eligibility
requirements for adoptive applicants intending to adopt a Filipino child who

In the Philippines, Filipino children need to be made socio-legally
free for adoption prior to any kind of alternative family placement.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-010#7:1>
In line with the ICAB 's mandated authority is the compliance of the
Philippines to an international instrument, The Hague Convention on the
Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Inter-country Adoption,
to which the Philippines is a State Party and is denominated as a Sending
Country. </p>
