Today I decided not to speak on education because it 's I think
over-discussed over-talked and still no action
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#2:1:A>
So it 's there is a sense of frustration on my part that despite the
very familiar and well-known problems of education in this country not not
much in terms of policy change in terms of uh of reform initiatives have
taken place
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#3:1:A>
And uh so I said I 'm going to choose another topic which also
affects in a way not directly but affects in a way our educational our
education our standards our or or the state of education and that is
corruption <indig> e </indig> corruption in our country <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#4:1:A>
I have a Powerpoint <&> = presentation </&> here like like Dan 's
introduction it 's also a summary also a summary presentation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#5:1:A>
This will not be the last word on the state of corruption in our
country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#6:1:A>
But I 'd like to sketch to you in general terms the magnitude of uh
official and political corruption in our country and uh how in my mind it
affects the the even the direction of our country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#7:1:A>
So let me begin by saying that the stench of corruption is the only
constant it seems in our public life
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#8:1:A>
For every peso for every peso spent on infrastructure projects and
the procurement of goods and services you know public bidding for goods and
services between twenty to fifty centavo of that peso is lost to corruption
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#9:1:A>
So if you have a let 's just for simplicity a one hundred peso road
that road is only fifty peso worth so very very shallow and one night of rain
will be washed away <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#10:1:A>
Now this is the this is an official study an official study
conducted by the World Bank not just of the Philippines but of uh of several
member nations of the world in uh last year
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#11:1:A>
You see the magnitude of money of public resources lost to official
corruption in the last twenty years forty-eight billion U S dollars and as of
twenty O one that would have been sufficient to pay off our debt our foreign
debt
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#12:1:A>
You know I attended an anti-corruption conference in Ottawa in the
middle of October
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#13:1:A>
One of the resource persons is the president of the World Institute
which initiated this study and gave an overview of corruption in the world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#14:1:A>
And I really sat so embarrassed because he cited us specifically as
one country that has not done anything to stem the tide of corruption
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#15:1:A>
Well this is familiar data the Transparency International a
Berlin-based monitoring and surveillance agency last August issued this <.> 
sur </.> this uh finding
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#16:1:A>
Our country is the eleventh most corrupt among one hundred two
countries that places us in the same category as <.> Paki </.> Pakistan <.> 
Zim </.> Zimbabwe and Romania
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#17:1:A>
I think that this uh level of corruption is also eating up into our
competitive status into our competitiveness
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#18:1:A>
Because another study by the World Economic Forum which is a
Geneva-based uh uh group of uh businessmen that holds regular fora all over
the world came up with this competitiveness <unclear> 1 word </unclear> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#19:1:A>
Last year we were forty-eight number forty-eight in the
competitiveness ranking today just one year later we have dropped to
sixty-one a change of thirteen thirteen levels
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#20:1:A>
The same group the World Economic Forum has a Public Institution
Index and the components of this index is how we administer contracts what is
the state of our law the independence of the judiciary <foreign> etcetera
 </foreign> and the other is the corruption level
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#21:1:A>
How do we rank in the Public Institution Index
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#22:1:A>
Last year we were number sixty-three today this year barely a year
we have dropped to number seventy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#23:1:A>
So the the pace the pace and and character of corruption in our
country is is on a rapid decline rather on a rapid rise
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#24:1:A>
Now how much does our country lose every year in terms of purchase
of goods and equipment and the commissioning of civil works
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#25:1:A>
That is the calculation not by us the opposition that is the
calculation of our own Department of Budget
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#26:1:A>
We 're losing twenty-two billion pesos a year <.> bec </.> on
account of corruption in the public bidding process
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#27:1:A>
What can twenty-two billion do
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#28:1:A>
This is a rough translation of what twenty-two billion a year if we
have that can do
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#29:1:A>
Well it can we can build forty-four thousand seven hundred new
classrooms we can buy twenty-four million new books we can purchase four
million desks and acquire forty-four thousand computers new computers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#30:1:A>
So if we can only save on what we lose through corruption I think
this perennial school crisis that we encounter every school opening of lack
of classrooms lack of teachers lack of desks and textbooks can be alleviated
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#31:1:A>
We I think we we remain the only country in the whole of North and
South East Asia with the largest class size
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#32:1:A>
Our class size is averaging fifty-five to sixty pupils per per per
class
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#33:1:A>
China with one point two billion pesos <&> should be people </&> 
has a class size of only thirty-two thirty-two pupils
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#34:1:A>
Malaysia Malaysia and Singapore of course they are relatively
prosperous has a class size of nineteen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#35:1:A>
So that that measures the magnitude of the lack of basic basic uh
needs of the education sector in our country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#36:1:A>
Now but what can we do
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#37:1:A>
Should we just uh uh tell each other and relate this sad story to
each other and not do anything
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#38:1:A>
What can be done as a practical doable way
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#39:1:A>
I suggest that uh this I think this can be done
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#40:1:A>
Number one we must strengthen the oversight function of Congress
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#41:1:A>
Unfortunately our people the public doesn't doesn't think that <.> 
congressio </.> that Congress could be a redeeming factor which is quite
unfortunate and that congressional investigation helps
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#42:1:A>
But in in any in any parliamentary democracy Congress oversight
function is an effective deterrence to public wrongdoing of government
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#43:1:A>
So we we ought to to do this and strengthen the oversight function
of Congress
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#44:1:A>
We must reform the the public bidding process of our country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#45:1:A>
The the bidding process of our country which requires a
pre-qualification uh stage then a main main evaluation is so designed that it
can be easily manipulated
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#46:1:A>
For instance my own experience in the Department of Agriculture
when we were bidding out not just millions but billions of pesos for
irrigation projects shows that in the pre-qualification process itself you
can already favor the contractor you want
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#47:1:A>
Somehow they 're able to to arrange that a favored contractor and a
favored contractor is usually one who can give the most is chosen even before
ahead of the main evaluation of the uh tenders
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#48:1:A>
So I have filed and I am I have we are now debating in the plenary
a Government Procurement Reform Act and this essentially this essentially
contains the the following requirements
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#49:1:A>
We are now going to announce bids not just in a newspaper but uh
but in the Internet we 'll put we 'll post it on the web site
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#50:1:A>
Every government agency must post it on the web site
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#51:1:A>
This practice of putting a floor also deprives government of the
opportunity to get really the best price because usually the the floor set
the floor set is generally higher than what the market tells us
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#52:1:A>
We 're going to prohibit or at least regulate the so-called price
adjustments and change orders
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#53:1:A>
What what does what does this mean
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#54:1:A>
When you are a contractor you will bid and you will submit probably
a ridiculously low low bid
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#55:1:A>
And under our rules since the lowest bidder is the is awarded the
contract then I will get the contract but after we 've concluded the contract
I will ask the agency to change I will submit a change order or the agency
will submit a change order
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#56:1:A>
And it 's not unusual that the original bid which won can be
doubled through these change orders and price adjustment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#57:1:A>
The classic case of that is the so-called Diosdado Macapagal Avenue
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#58:1:A>
It doubled not because of the original bidded price but because of
change orders
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#59:1:A>
The contractor won it because he really underbidded everybody and
by our rules he he got the contract
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#60:1:A>
We 're now going to impose a five-year warranty which there is none
as of the moment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#61:1:A>
A contractor can build that road to your village in one year it may
be wiped out by the rains and he 's not liable at all even if you can
demonstrate that he put in less gravel he put in less cement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#62:1:A>
And finally this open and competitive public bidding
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#63:1:A>
As I said tenders now will be placed on the Internet on the web
site
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#64:1:A>
Anyone anywhere in this country can bid
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#65:1:A>
So we hope that uh by making public bidding more open and more
transparent we would at least reduce the incidence of under-the-table and
corrupt practices
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#66:1:A>
The third uh the third area of concern to us is campaign finance
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#67:1:A>
In this country you can really pinpoint the business interests the
businessmen who regularly finance electoral campaigns whether for president
or senators or congressmen or
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#68:1:A>
And maybe I am exaggerating but Sonny knows this there are regulars
they 're professional fund uh campaign donors year in election after election
they are the regular regulars
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#69:1:A>
But when you are elected as a result of the support of this these
few who do you think you owe your allegiance or your loyalty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#70:1:A>
Do you think you can really introduce radical and structural reform
in business in the society if your funder or his interests will be hurt
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#71:1:A>
But that is the traditional state of campaign finance in our
country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#72:1:A>
But there is a new even more sinister funding source and that is
the gambling and the drug and the drug lords
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#73:1:A>
<indig> Jueteng </indig> lords have always funded especially the
local elections but we 've seen that even national elections have been
supported by <indig> jueteng </indig> lords and we 've tolerated it I think
and we have not made any outcry at all up to now
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#74:1:A>
But we are seeing drug money going into the electoral uh system and
to me that is that is so dangerous
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#75:1:A>
And that 's why that 's uh we I I put together with other Senators
a Campaign Finance Reform Act and I 've convinced my colleagues in the House
to file it too
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#76:1:A>
That will may not eliminate it totally but at least bring it out
into the open compel candidates and donors to disclose their donations in the
same manner that many countries outside the Philippines have done so
consistently and uniformly in the past two or three years
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#77:1:A>
We 're the only country now remaining without a Campaign Finance
Reform Act
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#78:1:A>
Because when you come come to think of it maybe the state of
politics in this country is such because we 've not taken care of the way we
are financing and choosing our leaders
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#79:1:A>
And if unless we do something about it I think we will be
perpetually held hostage by vested interests gambling and other illegal
activities syndicates as well as drug drug lords
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#80:1:A>
Now let me go back to effective oversight <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#81:1:A>
Really if uh if our parliamentarians realize the the good that can
be achieved by the proper exercise of of parliamentary oversight of
congressional oversight I think we will we will it will serve a very powerful
deterrence to wrongdoing in government
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#82:1:A>
But unfortunately as I said you know people don't look very kindly
on Congress and on our investigation and that 's why it 's important that we
invest our Congress that quality of integrity and credibility otherwise we
will never we 'll never be able to effectively provide the check and balance
that we need in in our country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#83:1:A>
And also that means that the committees and and its staff must be
well-trained and well-motivated
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#84:1:A>
I 've been to to several international fora discussing all this and
I 'm really quite impressed at the efforts being exerted by many parliaments
by many governments in providing support in terms of training and resources
to to parliaments and and the professional staff which we are not doing in
this country <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#85:1:A>
Now let me <O> clears throat </O> go back again to the political
parties
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#86:1:A>
We must also worry about the political parties because political
parties both in theory and practice is supposed to be the the screening
mechanism by which we select potential leaders of our society and of our
politics and supposed to provide the training and the orientation to them
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#87:1:A>
That 's not being performed by any political party in this country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#88:1:A>
Because as you very well know and I 'll repeat the trite remark
political parties in this country are more factions rather than genuine
political parties based on ideology based on programs it 's more
personalistic than you can ever find
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#89:1:A>
I just attended over the weekend an international conference of
political parties of Asia and uh and uh many political parties in Asia except
the except the totalitarian states really have a competitive party system
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#90:1:A>
They look to the parties to to influence the course and content of
public policy and through their selection of the present and future leaders
they really make a big impact on the society
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#91:1:A>
Now what is the bane of our political parties apart from the lack
of ideology
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#92:1:A>
Why is it that it 's so easy to leave your party and join another
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#93:1:A>
The <indig> yung balimbing </indig> <&> star fruit, a many-sided
fruit, reference to turncoatism </&> I think that 's unique to us
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#94:1:A>
I think that that 's also a function of the of the political system
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#95:1:A>
Our political system is a winner-take-all system
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#96:1:A>
Uh <indig> pag natalo ka talagang talo ka e </indig> <&> = if you
lose you really lose </&> you 're wiped out and all the all the patronage and
the advantages go to the winner who now dispense the perks and the pork
barrels
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-043#97:1:A>
But that 's not I think the main goal of of the party system just
to patronage and all but yet that is how it operates in our country </I> 3
