<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#3:1>
AS IT WAS IN THE BEGINNING, he was dust again, except that which
was left of his mortal self was contained in a white marble vessel -- smooth,
symmetrical from whatever angle one viewed it.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#4:1>
True, it was shaped in the classic form that should date back to long
before Jesus Christ was made Man--the ones perched on the shoulders of women,
strung astride humps of camels and donkeys.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#5:1>
But there are vessels and vessels.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#6:1>
This, the grains were mostly vertical but for a few horizontal ones
which splashed in maverick moods of ivory and whisper streaks of blue-gray.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#7:1>
His son, a young businessman into pharmaceuticals--had chosen it.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#8:1>
But he, the dead one who had been a civil engineer and an architect
with his all-time preoccupation of fusing form and function, could not have
done better. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#9:1>
They, folks and friends, had just started to put away the lunch
boxes which they ate out of while they waited in the crematory site.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#10:1>
It takes four hours for fire to consume man 's physical being.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#11:1>
The bones, the stubborn calcium, are ground into powder. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#12:1>
A special courier had delivered the vessel.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#13:1>
<it> Look </it> , the son, John, said, holding it up, <it> this will
hold Daddy 's ashes. </it>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#14:1>
Some drew near, touched the marble jar.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#15:1>
Beautifully crafted, cool, sensuous to the touch.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#16:1>
<it> Way to go </it> said the nephew who covered the police beat.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#17:1>
But it was Mark 's opinion that John sought more.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#18:1>
Mark whose labors in an advertising agency assured him of the
wherewithal for his Sunday paintings and snazzy bachelor 's pad.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#19:1>
From where he was, which was a perch beside a plaster-of-Paris angel,
he tilted his chin in the direction of that end of the shed.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#20:1>
<it> It 's him </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#21:1>
Meaning the uncle who was now being resolutely consumed by the
crematory flame. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#22:1>
The widow, Ann, maintained the calm and the poise of the
well-bred.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#23:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Well into middle age &rdquo; </quote> is a verbal
<foreign> fandango </foreign> for people in their sixties who gracefully ward
off, without the help of derrick jobs, the <foreign> fiat </foreign> of time
with neatness and style and a few well-chosen cosmetics.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#24:1>
At one time, she had taught school but decided early enough that all
that five-foot-four endearing young charm could better be used as a flight
stewardess.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#25:1>
This, rather than endless lesson planning for forty-to-a-classroom
snotty-nosed kids.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#26:1>
But it was when smarty pants digs like <quote> <it> coffee? tea? or
me? </it> </quote> had yet to be.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#27:1>
When the fly-now-pay-later sales concept would have been for the
birds; when passengers bought their tickets at the airport counter and
surrendered these when the plane was well into the clouds and there was no
known case of some Slippery Sam having been pushed out from up there because
he had slipped in with the baggage loader.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#28:1>
Yes, Ann was quite lively.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#29:1>
It was probably one of the reasons why Joe married her, partial to
beauty that he was, although it was also said that she waylaid Joe like he
was the last man on earth.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#30:1>
But then there 's no accounting for directions projectiles of acids
take--in this case, of course, from across the aisle in the groom 's section.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#31:1>
But it was a fine middle-middle class wedding all told. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#32:1>
Jose ( look, he even had a bread-and-butter name, taken after the
carpenter saint, but which in the inevitable process of crisp acculturation
became Joe) was predictable enough.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#33:1>
The Filipino &ldquo; good &rdquo; man that emerges from the &ldquo;
clean-cut &rdquo; young man.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#34:1>
He gave up varsity basketball because he had to clerk his way through
college; talking, of course, of the pre-fat-stipend days for agile young
brawns.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#35:1>
His folks once living on the blessings of the copra trade were no
longer.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#36:1>
That war was a nasty one.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#37:1>
True, there was once talk of cleaning out the wild guavas grown
happily among the coconut trees, but who was going to do that?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#38:1>
The old tenants were dying out; their children were finding it more
lucrative to work as clerks, day laborers, <foreign> <it> lavanderas </it>
</foreign> <&> =laundrywomen </&> and, yes, there was even a singing barber
servicing a platoon of American G.I. s whose tents were spread under the
coconut groves.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#39:1>
When the soldiers left, inclinations were no longer for tenancy and
the children of landlords would not take another look at one more glassful of
fresh coconut toddy.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#40:1>
Joe?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#41:1>
All he wanted was to build houses. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#42:1>
But did Joe ever regret giving up varsity?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#43:1>
Did his heart turn a bitter twist when he watched schoolmates walk
away with cheers and pennants and loving cups?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#44:1>
He never gave any indication.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#45:1>
It seemed that all the looking back he did was that: through the
years there was nothing in the world that could keep him out of ringside
Memorial Stadium during basketball seasons or, if out of town, nothing that
could keep him away from ringside television set.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#46:1>
He cheered, cursed, laughed, tsk-tsking mistakes, slapping the arm of
his chair, a piece of furniture of splendid construction and by now with a
kind of lived-in stuffing.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#47:1>
During the commercial, he would reach out for an orange, popcorn,
potato chips, peanuts, pop drinks--just like what those in the bleachers were
doing.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#48:1>
No, no beer.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#49:1>
He neither drank nor smoked.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#50:1>
It was no little puzzle then to folks when they were told that he had
cancer of the liver. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#51:1>
Doctors.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#52:1>
The first, a young <indig> <it> balikbayan </it> </indig> <&>
returnee to the country </&> , supervised the tests, examined this father of
his best friend.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#53:1>
He said, <quote> <it> John, I 'm afraid your Daddy 's case is
terminal.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#54:1>
The best that can be done, </it> </quote> he said, <quote> <it> is to
keep him as comfortable as possible and prepare him spiritually </it> .
</quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#55:1>
Then he added, <quote> <it> But w-e-l-l, you might take him to an
internist. </it> </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#56:1>
Then he took off for Canada, to make good the requirements of his
green card. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#57:1>
The internist ordered for more tests, identical to the first
ones, kept Joe in the hospital and himself hied off for a five-day sojourn in
cool Hong Kong.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#58:1>
When he came back, he endorsed Joe to a specialist who himself had
just flown in from parts of Europe.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#59:1>
This one was to operate, expose the patient to the rays--the works!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#60:1>
The fee was astronomical.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#61:1>
Hope does not come cheap.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#62:1>
<it> <quote> No, Doc </quote> </it> , Joe said, turning rural, <it>
<quote> if I have to cough up all that, I 'll have to sell my <indig> carabao
</indig> </quote> </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#63:1>
The specialist said, <quote> <it> no, you 'd have to sell hundreds of
<indig> carabaos </indig> </quote> . </it>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#64:1>
A crisp urban put-down.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#65:1>
<quote> <it> If I 'm going to die anyway, damn if you 'll get any of
my <indig> carabaos </indig> . </it> </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#66:1>
Yokel Joe went home. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#67:1>
Food.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#68:1>
Joe knew and enjoyed food and at one period in his life showed it:
the expanded girth, the chubby cheeks, the booming laugh of the well-fed.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#69:1>
But he dropped the pounds when it was time.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#70:1>
His best friend 's ticker covered with fat had quit and his widow
blamed pork <indig> adobo </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#71:1>
Joe took the cue from there.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#72:1>
He took to jogging, walking, and hopping.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#73:1>
In hole-in-the-wall discos, he sweated it out to the beat of beat
music taking along face towels, the ones printed with messages of smiling
goodwill in red Chinese characters on one end and on the other end, the
translation in Roman: Good Morning.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#74:1>
Indeed, Joe 's common gestures were of good will, gusty, teasing
humor.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#75:1>
A wisecrack here, there, corn a-plenty. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#76:1>
Anyway, food.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#77:1>
Foreigners remark on the Filipino fascination for food.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#78:1>
<quote> You 're always eating, </quote> they say.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#79:1>
Asians do, really.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#80:1>
There seems to be a philosophy behind it or it won't be charming.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#81:1>
A gracious Chinese lady welcomes one to her house on a hot summer day
with a glass of cold fruit juice.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#82:1>
<it> <quote> Drink </quote> </it> , she urges.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#83:1>
Minutes after, she asks, <quote> C.R.? </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#84:1>
<mention> C.R. </mention> is <mention> comfort room </mention> , a
Philippine euphemism for <mention> toilet </mention> , mincing steps away
from <mention> Ladies/Gentlemen </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#85:1>
Nowhere in other English-speaking countries are they <mention>
&ldquo; comfort rooms. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#86:1>
Well, then, O.K., to the C.R.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#87:1>
Only then, after the cool loading and the warm unloading would the
lady talk business.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#88:1>
Right on!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#89:1>
<foreign> Yang </foreign> , <foreign> yin </foreign> in place.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#90:1>
Did <mention> C.R. </mention> start in a Philippine Chinatown?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#91:1>
Joe swore so at one time.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#92:1>
He said he was there when it happened.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#93:1>
In an Ongpin restaurant among the best of Chinese <foreign> <it>
mestizo </it> </foreign> <foreign> hombres </foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#94:1>
So, right across Joe 's sickbed was a <foreign> mahjongg
</foreign> table laden with food.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#95:1>
Joe could no longer suck a fourth segment of an orange but was still
directing traffic to the food pile.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#96:1>
<it> <quote> Willie </quote> </it> , he says to the young <indig>
<it> balikbayan </it> </indig> doctor who had just walked in.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#97:1>
<quote> <it> There 's Hormel ham and fresh French loaf.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#98:1>
Tell the maid to fix you a sandwich before you settle down to work on
my carcass. </it> </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#99:1>
Laughter here.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#100:1>
Always, they met his sallies with amused, appreciative laughter.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#101:1>
Especially now. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#102:1>
There 's a daughter.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#103:1>
She 's well on the way to matron fat.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#104:1>
Three children, husband, all fat.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#105:1>
Joe misses her when she 's not around.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#106:1>
<quote> <it> Where 's Betty?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#107:1>
Why isn't she here? </it> </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#108:1>
Ann answers, <it> <quote> She 'll be here after office hours.
</quote> </it>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#109:1>
He bristles.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#110:1>
<quote> <it> She has to slave to feed that nitwit of a husband </it> .
</quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#111:1>
Ann 's lips press, her sigh almost imperceptible.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#112:1>
Yet Rudy had not always been a dependent.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#113:1>
He is a photographer.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#114:1>
At one time his job was to follow a very important person with
unlimited powers over life and death, to record her poses for prosperity.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#115:1>
Oh, he loved that job!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#116:1>
When the power, pelf and glory of his employer went <foreign> <it>
kaput </it> </foreign> , Rudy floundered, thrashed about--a fish out of the
water.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#117:1>
There was no job he would hold on to, no other job he would seek.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#118:1>
He had judged himself overqualified for whatever the term meant in
job classification manuals and the state of the family larder.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#119:1>
But his wife and--yessir, his mother-in-law--backed him up in this
self-esteem that justified his present state of non-productivity.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#120:1>
But there was the summary of his worth recorded in an enlarged color
photograph of the lady he once served, framed in gilt and hung where everyone
who walked in the front door of his home could see immediately--placed a bit
to the right of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and a bit to the left of the Virgin
of Fatima. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#121:1>
But solicitude and tender care for Joe there was no lack of.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#122:1>
Two hired professional nurses worked in shifts, two male clerks from
the son 's office did the tasks which needed muscles, assorted folks and
friends lent willing hands.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#123:1>
He loved people; he got them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#124:1>
Martha, a sister, had flown in from California, taking time off
from the nursing home duties to be with her sick brother.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#125:1>
From the airport, she went straight to his bedside.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#126:1>
She bent over to kiss him, smooth his brow and is yet surprised to
feel shoulder blades pushing against skin cover.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#127:1>
In a short while, she opened a valise.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#128:1>
Gifts for just about everyone.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#129:1>
But ah! three pairs of Florsheim shoes, a pair, of course, for Joe.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#130:1>
He 's so pleased.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#131:1>
He holds up the very elegant pair.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#132:1>
They seem to have dropped out of the pages of <mention> <it> Esquire
</it> </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#133:1>
Then softly he says, <quote> <it> What use would I have for this
now? </it> </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#134:1>
A pall, dark, cold, sweeps over the room.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#135:1>
Now he ups and verbalizes the truth; how inconsiderate of him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#136:1>
Martha winces, breathes deeply.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#137:1>
But, brightening just as quickly, says, <quote> <it> I thought you
might wear them to my wedding. </it> </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#138:1>
She 's overweight by twenty pounds and sassy as hell, but that 's
not why they met her statement with laughter.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#139:1>
They 're all familiar with the story of one of her charges--an old
man, carcass of a once-warrior who had to be helped to the bathroom, who
offered to marry her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#140:1>
The old codger never missed an opportunity to pinch her ass.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#141:1>
Then she threatened to sue for sexual harassment.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#142:1>
He was so flattered, he almost died laughing.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#143:1>
At this point Martha would end her narrative: <quote> <it> I 'm not
kidding, we had to clamp on the respirator. </it> </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#144:1>
They laughed over it again, adding other asides, laughed again.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#145:1>
The thought of death is scuttled into the atmosphere, which the wife
constantly sprays with verbena scent from a mauve aerosol can.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#146:1>
Now the son tries on the gleaming Florsheim.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#147:1>
His face brightens, <quote> <it> Hey look, they fit me! </it>
</quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#148:1>
Joe smiles.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#149:1>
Everybody o-h-hs, a-h-hs.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#150:1>
All is right again. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#151:1>
There is no shortage of advice.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#152:1>
Anything from dietary changes, restrictions, musts, a trip to a cave
in Laguna, the mountains of Pangasinan, an ancient church in Cebu, an open
field in a politician 's cash-strapped bailiwick in La Union, where an
open-faced youth directs the multitude to look straight into the glaring sun
for the vision of the Blessed Virgin; never mind that ophthalmologists have a
heyday fixing sun-blinded peepers afterwards.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#153:1>
Faith--not mild, not middling; faith that moves mountains, dries up
seas.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#154:1>
Ask and ye shall be given.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#155:1>
Certain priests, certain nuns have special gifts for healing.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#156:1>
They, the chosen mediums for miraculous cures.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#157:1>
Of health regained, deferment of mortality.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#158:1>
Father X does healing on certain days.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#159:1>
Sister Y will not be available until next month.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#160:1>
She 's in Rome, summoned by the Pope.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#161:1>
Said in awed whisper.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#162:1>
Oh, but so was Father Z of our parish.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#163:1>
Now, he holds healing sessions in the Luneta.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#164:1>
Any number of healing, healing, healing.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#165:1>
All signs lead to all manner, methods of prayers, sacrifices,
abstentions, herbs, pills, and potions.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#166:1>
Joe is not without hope for a miracle.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#167:1>
There are no atheists in the foxhole.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#168:1>
Try, knock that.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#169:1>
But it has to be a miracle if health is given back to this festering
belly.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#170:1>
Yet time came when Joe no longer saw it right to leave the bed in
the homeground.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#171:1>
He had rushed out of the church during one of the healing sessions
fearing that he would keel over.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#172:1>
He was fighting for oxygen with the devotees and the candles.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#173:1>
The sister from America rushed out after him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#174:1>
<quote> <it> Gee, that was something!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#175:1>
I was wondering how long you 'd last.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#176:1>
I was going to drop dead myself </it> . </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#177:1>
But there will always be faith and hope.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#178:1>
So, O.K., the formula changes from believer to believer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#179:1>
The older sister, Rosario came, the folks called <mention>
Charing </mention> , <mention> Sergeant </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#180:1>
She was the only one left who called Joe, <mention> Pepito
</mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#181:1>
A retired schoolteacher, she continued to occupy the old family
house in the province.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#182:1>
She gave piano lessons to the town 's children and recited poetry,
her own or others ' at the least provocation.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#183:1>
She remained single, having once judged it her bounden duty to take
care of siblings when their parents could no longer.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#184:1>
Rosario--the quintessential Filipino woman: dutiful daughter,
sister-mother, the aunt to run to, and the teacher who cares.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-009#185:1>
