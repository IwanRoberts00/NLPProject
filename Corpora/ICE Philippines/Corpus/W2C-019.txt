<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#3:1>
WITH RAINS now starting to fall regularly, the Estrada
administration is going full-blast on the disaster and rehabilitation phases
of its program geared to minimize the damage to be wrought by <foreign> La
Ni&ntilde;a </foreign> weather phenomenon. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#4:1>
Five government agencies, led by the Department of Agriculture are
implementing this program. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#5:1>
Other agencies involved are the Department of Public Works and
Highways, the National Food Authority, the Bureau of Soils and Water
Management, and the National Irrigation Administration. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#6:1>
In a report, acting Agriculture Secretary William Dar said the
government has already set aside &peso;1.1 billion in guaranteed loans for
banks supporting the <foreign> La Ni&ntilde;a </foreign> preparation program.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#7:1>
At present, Dar said, the DA is distributing &peso;5 million worth
of seeds to farmers for replanting. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#8:1>
Its regional field units do not only administer farm
rehabilitation work, but also provide timely information to the DA secretary
and to the National Disaster Coordinating Council, he added. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#9:1>
For its part, the banking sector provides emergency credit for
farmers whose crops are affected by <foreign> La Ni&ntilde;a </foreign> 's
rains and floods. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#10:1>
The loans involve a total of &peso;750 million for some 75,000
hectares of ricelands that the government expects <foreign> La Ni&ntilde;a
</foreign> 's rains and floods to affect. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#11:1>
Banks also set aside &peso;350 million for some 50,000 has. of
corn lands with affected farmers standing to each get a &peso;7,000 loan for
every hectare damaged by <foreign> La Ni&ntilde;a </foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#12:1>
Under the program, the NFA deploys rice stocks in strategic
warehouses to ensure the availability of grain supplies in time of need. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#13:1>
It also offers drying facilities to farmers at subsidized rates
should the disaster hit during the harvest season, and is planning a more
intensified grain procurement program. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#14:1>
The NIA implements repair and rehabilitation works and deploys
equipment and machinery for cleaning operations of irrigation canals during
and after major typhoons. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#15:1>
NIA also helps the DPWH maintain farm-to-market roads to make
sure they remain passable during and after major typhoons. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#16:1>
For its part, BSWM is supervising the construction of structures
and facilities for agricultural rehabilitation in vulnerable areas. </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#19:2>
FILIPINOS greeted the New Year with much reduced casualties from
firecracker explosions and stray bullets but with the same intensity of
merriment and revelry. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#20:2>
Reports reaching the Department of Health and the Philippine
National Police as of noon yesterday said 14 people were hit by stray bullets
and 310 were victims of firecracker explosions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#21:2>
The total, said Health Secretary Alberto &ldquo; Quasi &rdquo;
Romualdez Jr., represented a more than 50 percent reduction in casualties
compared to last year 's which recorded 593. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#22:2>
The PNP also said at least five people - - a member of the PNP
Traffic Management Group, an Air Force soldier, a member of the Philippine
Marines and two security guards - - were arrested for firing their guns into
the air during the celebration. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#23:2>
President Estrada himself warned that soldiers and policemen
caught firing their guns to greet the New Year would be dismissed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#24:2>
Meanwhile, civilians violating the ban would be charged in court,
according to authorities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#25:2>
The DOH reported that 492 people were injured in the past 10 days
nationwide, including 37 who needed amputations.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#26:2>
Most of the injuries occurred on Thursday night and a vast majority
of the injured were sent home after treatment, it said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#27:2>
There were no deaths. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#28:2>
At least 14 people, including 10 in Manila, were injured in
gunfire when people fired into the air to celebrate the advent of the new
year, authorities said, despite government appeals for people not to fire
their guns. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#29:2>
Most of the others were burned or sustained eye injuries from
firecrackers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#30:2>
Filipinos traditionally let off firecrackers at the stroke of
midnight on Dec. 31 - - and for some hours on either side - - to ward off
evil spirits in the new year.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#31:2>
But each year hundreds of people are injured and some are killed in
accidents. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#32:2>
Thursday night was little different.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#33:2>
The sky over Manila, a city of 12 million people, was ablaze at
midnight with rockets showering pockets of light into the air while there was
a cacophony of noise on the streets below. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#34:2>
Car drivers, huddled in their seats as firecrackers burst around
their vehicles, tooted their horns at midnight while people on balconies
showered coins on the revellers below and beat on the railings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#35:2>
But this year the noise all but died out half an hour into the
year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#36:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Usually there 's noise until two or three in the
morning, &rdquo; </quote> said a security guard outside a bar in Makati, the
financial heart of the capital, as the lingering smoke from the firecrackers
slowly began to lift.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#37:2>
<quote> &ldquo; It 's much quieter now. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#38:2>
Others said the economic crisis in the country had led to less
fervent celebrations - - and a corresponding decline in the severity of
accidents. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#39:2>
<quote> &ldquo; There are many factors that caused this decline,
among them is the economic situation, &rdquo; </quote> Romualdez told
reporters.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#40:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Injuries are less severe this year, which really
means that people are more careful. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#41:2>
However, Romualdez conceded that the number of victims could rise
as soon as all reports from all regions come in. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#42:2>
Of the 14 victims of stray bullets, 10 came from Mindanao and the
four others from Metro Manila. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#43:2>
Based on the partial reports, firecracker explosions and firing
of guns decreased by 58 percent compared to 1997. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#44:2>
This was the first time that the country experienced a less
explosive New Year 's Eve celebration, which Filipinos usually observed in
the past with unabated explosion of firecrackers all over the land,
particularly in Metro Manila. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#45:2>
Aggravating the situation was the indiscriminate firing of guns
by soldiers, policemen and civilian gun owners. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#46:2>
Weeks before the Christian holidays, the government and
non-government organizations launched a massive campaign nationwide asking
gunholders to refrain from firing their firearms to celebrate the incoming
New Year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#47:2>
The drive also discouraged citizens from exploding firecrackers,
particularly the big ones which had caused injuries to thousands of victims
the previous years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#48:2>
The PNP said that while the celebration of the New Year was not
devoid of gunfires and firecracker explosions, there was less in the 1999 New
Year 's observance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#49:2>
Aside from the government 's big success in convincing people not
to fire their guns and explode firecrackers, another reason could be the
economic crisis the country has been experiencing the past 18 months. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#50:2>
But there were still those who were hard-headed who insisted on
playing with firecrackers and firing their guns. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#51:2>
As a result, one had his arm amputated when he picked and lit up
an unlit fountain early dawn yesterday.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#52:2>
The fountain exploded in his hand. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#53:2>
All 16 major hospitals in Metro Manila reported a big decrease in
the number of victims of firecracker explosion and gunfire. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> House frowns on new taxes </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#55:3>
<bold> Tita C. Valderama </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#56:3>
THE HOUSE leadership is not keen on giving priority to any tax
measure in the first six months of the new year, according to acting Speaker
Eduardo Gullas. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#57:3>
<quote> &ldquo; We will give due importance first to reforms in
the power sector, banking, grains importation, environment and securities
market before any revenue measure is taken up, &rdquo; </quote> said Gullas.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#58:3>
Speaker Manuel Villar, who is on a month-long annual family
vacation in the United States, has designated Gullas, the senior deputy
speaker, as acting Speaker. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#59:3>
It was Gullas who represented Villar in the signing of the
&peso;579.5 billion national government budget for this year in
Malaca&ntilde;ang on Dec. 30. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#60:3>
According to Gullas, Villar has specified the House priorities
this year in various meetings with chamber 's leadership before the end of
1998. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#61:3>
Reforms in the power sector, Gullas said, will be highlighted by
the approval of the Omnibus Power Bill which restructures the electric power
industry through the privatization of the National Power Corp. to allow
private entities to engage in power generation, transmission and
distribution. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#62:3>
The Committee on Energy, chaired by Camarines Sur Rep. Arnulfo
Fuentebella, has consolidated several bills related to the power sector
restructuring into House Bill 4579. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#63:3>
At present, power generation is undertaken by the Napocor,
independent power producers and self-generators.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#64:3>
Power transmission, on the other hand, is centralized and vested in
the Napocor while electric distribution is fragmented with over 130
facilities consisting of private utilities, municipal utilities and electric
cooperatives, mostly small and uneconomic. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#65:3>
Napocor 's huge debt, roughly &peso;500 billion, and the highly
capital-intensive character of the power industry have been considered
critical constraints to the expansion of the industry.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#66:3>
Data from Napocor show that the demand for electricity is expected to
increase by 58 percent annually over the next 10 years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#67:3>
This will require government to raise at least &dollar;1 billion
a year or &dollar;10 billion over 10 years to meet this growing demand. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#68:3>
Aware of the government 's limited resources, legislative and
executive officials of the previous administration arrived at a decision to
encourage private capital into the power sector by opening up the industry
through restructuring and privatization instead of squeezing scarce
government funds or raising power rates to generate the needed amount for
expansion projects. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#69:3>
In the banking sector, Gullas said several bills seeking to
strengthen the financial system against problems similar to those associated
with the currency turmoil last year will be consolidated. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#70:3>
This will have to be rushed considering that the Committee on
Banks and Financial Intermediaries was just organized in early December, with
Batangas Rep. Jose Macario Laurel IV as chairman. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#71:3>
One of the reforms in grains importation is to open up the
authority to import rice and corn in order to lessen the burden of the
National Food Authority, Gullas said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#72:3>
The Clean Air Act will also be a priority among the many
environment bills pending in the House. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#73:3>
Gullas said the controversial provision on incinerator, which
hampered its approval in the previous Congress, had been deleted to hasten
the measure 's enactment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#74:3>
Tax bills, including the amnesty and census of taxpayers, soft
drinks tax and road users ' or motor vehicle tax, will have to wait until the
second regular session in July, Gullas said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#75:3>
<quote> &ldquo; The leadership has agreed on this, that the tax
bills will not be prioritized in the first half of the year, &rdquo; </quote>
he said. </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#78:4>
THE SEPARATIST <indig> Moro </indig> Islamic Liberation Front
continued to buildup its forces, recruiting 3,790 fighters during the past
three years, a military yearend report said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#79:4>
The report said the MILF under Hashim Salamat has now a total of
11,990 guerrillas as of the end of 1998, compared to the 8,200 in 1996. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#80:4>
In 1997, the MILF added 1,130 recruits to its forces in Southern
Philippines, mostly in Central Mindanao where the MILF has established its
headquarters at Camp Abubakar. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#81:4>
At the same time, the military said the MILF also acquired
additional firepower.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#82:4>
The military estimates that the MILF has a total of 8,240 assorted
firearms, up by 1,275 from the 6,965 in 1996.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#83:4>
In 1997, the MILF had some 8,200 firearms of various calibers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#84:4>
The build-up of firepower and recruitment activities occurred
while a ceasefire agreement between the government and the MILF is in place,
the military said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#85:4>
However, it noted that gun battles between the government and the
MILF had gone down a bit from 369 in 1997 to 293 in 1998.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#86:4>
This was attributed to the existing truce in effect. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#87:4>
Armed encounters initiated by the MILF in 1998 were recorded at
185 compared to 222 in 1997.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#88:4>
On the other hand, government forces initiated 108 attacks against
MILF, down from the 147 AFP-initiated in 1997. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#89:4>
As a result of the ceasefire, fatalities from both sides had
decreased drastically since 1996. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#90:4>
The military said that 33 government troops died from clashes
with the MILF in 1998, compared to 51 in 1997.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#91:4>
In 1996, the government suffered 104 dead.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#92:4>
The fatalities on the government side included military personnel,
policemen and a Cafgu paramilitary unit. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#93:4>
MILF fatalities also went down from 168 in 1996 to 80 in 1998.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#94:4>
In 1997, the MILF suffered 165 dead. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#95:4>
A total of 690 MILF surrendered the past three years with the
biggest at 405 surrenders in 1997, followed by 278 in 1996 and 207 in 1998,
the military report said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#96:4>
Captured MILF rebels in 1998 were placed only at seven.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#97:4>
In 1997 and 1996, there were 24 and 0 MILF rebels who surrendered,
respectively. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#98:4>
In firearms exchange, the military had the upperhand.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#99:4>
The AFP captured 60 firearms in 1998 and lost only 14, or a net gain
of 46 firearms in favor of the government.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#100:4>
In 1997, government forces recovered 13 firearms and lost only 17 to
MILF rebels.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-019#101:4>
In 1996, the AFP seized 91 firearms and lost 52, or a net gain of
39. </p> </I>
