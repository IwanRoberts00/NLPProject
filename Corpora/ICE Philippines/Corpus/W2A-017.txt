<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#4:1>
The spread of the industrial revolution to lands that had once
been colonies wasn't the only accomplishment of the nation-state.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#5:1>
Nation-states have served as the live laboratories in which numerous
approaches to deep-seated social problems of diverse societies have been
tried, and continue to be tried.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#6:1>
Those approaches would never have been for the nation-state. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#7:1>
Concrete examples abound.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#8:1>
We can begin with the New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt, which was
aimed at the Great Depression, fashioned by Bismarck, under which labor was
assured of co-participation the management of nation 's factories; the
Democratic Socialism enshrined in the Indian Constitution, which was the
handiwork of Jawarhalal Nehru, and which incorporates many principles dear to
the heart of the papal encyclicals; the Welfare System of the Scandinavian
countries, generally looked upon as a viable alternative to marxist
socialism; the Pragmatic Socialism of Singapore, fashioned by its founder,
Lee Kuan Yew, which combines a heavy element of direct state ownership of
business enterprises with a liberal policy toward foreign capital; the
Managed Market Economy of Indonesia; the notion of the Corporate State
conceived by the Meijis of Japan, and avidly followed by South Korea; the
Socialist Market System initiated by Deng of China; the pure communist system
of Fidel Castro 's Cuba; the New Economic Policy of Malaysia aimed at
rectifying the social and economic disparity between the indigenous Malays
and the Malays of Chinese descent; and, of course, our own Filipino First
policy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#9:1>
Nation-states brought governments to people who needed them and
their emergence represented a quantum leap by humanity away from the
universally autocratic system of royal dynasties and toward the system of
representative government. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#10:1>
Thus, with the nation-states came a system of welfare legislation
that varied according to the political and economic circumstances of each
nation-state: Unemployment benefits to the unemployed; minimum wage;
prohibition of child labor; social security for workers and the aged;
medicare for the needy; state patronage of the arts; vast network of public
transport systems and physical infrastructure; free education; grants and
aids to scientific research and inventions, and a host of others.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#11:1>
None of these would have been available to innumerable races of the
world had they not separated from the system of empire or from the system of
colonies to which they had originally belonged; if they hadn't in brief,
constituted themselves as sovereign nation-states by writing their own
Declaration of Independence. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#12:1>
But today, this system of nation-states and the doctrine of
mercantilism are under mortal threat from the powerful adherents of an
international movement out to drive these two interdependent concepts to
extinction.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#13:1>
That threat is what free trade, globalism and the IMF are about, and
we shall discuss that threat in some detail. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#14:1>
But before we do, it is important that we take a more detailed
view of mercantilism than what we have done so far because popular
understanding of it, even in the world of academe, is pitifully limited and
misleading.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#15:1>
And that limited understanding prevents us from appreciating the full
dimension of the stakes involved in this war of ideologies that has now
deeply unsettled Asia. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#16:1>
This developmental ideology is widely associated with <mention>
protectionism </mention> , a term that is essentially defensive in
connotation, making it vulnerable to popular criticism.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#17:1>
It is negatively interpreted as a way by which existing domestic
industries, many of them inefficient, are shielded from the competition of
imports through high tariffs and a network of import quotas, prohibitions and
even environmental and health standards designed to place obstacles to
foreign goods.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#18:1>
Protectionism, however, although an important component of
mercantilism, is only one aspect of that ideology and is not necessarily the
most important. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#19:1>
Mercantilism is more than protectionism.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#20:1>
The doctrine represents a strategic complex of affirmative policy
tools and practices designed to enable nation-states saddled with
pre-industrial economies to engineer their industrial revolution and catapult
themselves to the industrial age, by their own bootstrap. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#21:1>
Practiced by the most pre-eminent mercantilist of his time, Jean
Baptiste Colbert, who served as finance minister of France under Louis XIV,
mercantilism took shape as a conscious and positive strategy to make France
an industrial and commercial power.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#22:1>
An article on Colbert in the <it> Encyclopedia Britannica </it> (
1964 ed.) said of this program that it <quote> &ldquo; gave privileges to a
number of private industries and founded state manufactures. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#23:1>
The economic historian, George Soule, said of Colbert: <X> <quote>
&ldquo; He fostered manufactures and commerce by tariffs on imports, bounties
to French shipping. ...improved transportation at home.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#X24:1>
Colbert granted monopolies to encourage new enterprises, especially
in overseas trade, stimulated inventions, established model industries.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#X25:1>
Within a decade he doubled the King 's revenues, and made France the
most powerful nation in Europe. &rdquo; </quote> ( Ideas of the Great
Economists, New American Library). </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#26:1>
European mercantilism deeply influenced the thinking of America 's
first economic architect, Alexander Hamilton. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#27:1>
Tasked to map out an economic course for his young nation
Hamilton saw, as discussed earlier, the danger and folly of free trade, the
path suggested by American agricultural interests who wanted free trade with
Britain.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#28:1>
He opted for the formula applied by the European mercantilists and
urged his government to promote industry and manufactures through a system of
tariffs, bounties and subsidies.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#29:1>
( Miller, <foreign> op. cit. </foreign> ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#30:1>
Like every economic nationalist, Hamilton was a consummate
realist.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#31:1>
He knew that the business of developing a nation-state was a business
far too formidable and serious to be left alone to businessmen.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#32:1>
And so, like Colbert before him, and the host of Asian statesmen who
would eventually come after him, he proposed that government and private
business join hands in a conscious, coordinated effort to develop the economy
by <quote> &ldquo; fostering the growth of manufactures. &rdquo; </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#33:1>
In pleading that the nation 's industrial development be
undertaken jointly by government and private business, linked to each other
under government guidance and influence, Hamilton reasoned that <quote>
&ldquo; the closer the bond between government and businessmen, the better
for the state: in such a connection the government would benefit from the
wealth they produced and it would be in a position to direct their
acquisitive instincts into channels beneficial to the country as a whole.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#34:1>
Hamilton 's mercantilist proposal for a close bond between
government and private interests became a prominent principle in the strategy
of the Asian tigers to industrialize in record time.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#35:1>
Japan 's pioneering years at industrialization during the Meiji
regime in late 19th century leaned heavily on the extensive application of
that Hamilton principle.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#36:1>
That explains the pervasive presence of the Japanese state in the
economy during the initial years of its industrial program, not only central
planner but as entrepreneur and proprietor engaged in virtually every mode of
enterprise, from manufacturing to mining, trade, agriculture and even the
vice industries, tobacco and liquor. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#37:1>
After Colbert of France and Hamilton of America came Bismarck of
Germany.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#38:1>
Influenced by the ideas of Friedrich List, the German economic
nationalist ( who in turn had been influenced by Hamilton and the American
experience), Bismarck went about organizing Germany as an industrial state
around the mercantilist formula.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#39:1>
While starting out ideologically as a free trader, his ambition to
make Germany the most powerful state in Europe and his search for ways which
would bring that about led him inescapably to mercantilism.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#40:1>
The German statesman, however, met formidable opposition from
conservative landholders who feared that protectionism would work against
their interest.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#41:1>
Bismarck hurdled the opposition by offering to extend protectionism
to the farm sector as well. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#42:1>
As a biographer said of Bismarck 's ideological conversion and
his tactic to persuade the agrarian free traders toward protectionism:
<quote> &ldquo; Having abandoned Free Trade, he now wanted thoroughgoing
Protection, and stirred the sectional interests to bid against each other.
<X>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#X43:1>
The conservative agrarians, for instance--most of them
aristocrats--agreed to the tariff on iron and steel only in exchange for high
tariff on grain." </quote> ( see A. J. P. Taylor, Bismarck, Nel Mentor
Books). </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#44:1>
From continental Europe and America, mercantilism spread as a
worldwide religion and became the battlecry of every nation-state that came
to being.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#45:1>
Mexico, Brazil and Argentina in Latin America carried its torch
through economies that industrialized by way of steep tariffs, import
restrictions, control of foreign investments, and the proliferation of
state-owned enterprises. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#46:1>
In Asia, Japan for a long time was the lone but fanatic
practitioner, and that fanaticism made her the lone but fanatic state in Asia
before the outbreak of the last war.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#47:1>
Pulverized by American air power, she literally rose from the dead to
become in time the second largest economy in the world.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#48:1>
This spectacular feat she accomplished through her unyielding
post-war application of mercantilism, of which she continues to be an
embodiment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#49:1>
China, of course, is the latest, and overpowering, evidence of
how mercantilism can radically alter for the better the lives of nations and
peoples by transporting them to the machine age.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#50:1>
The rise of China as the third largest economy in the world when only
fifty years ago she was with India, the begging bowl of Asia, is a monumental
testament to the transforming impact of the doctrine. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#51:1>
It wasn't communism that changed China from a pre-industrial
economy to an industrial giant, and from a land once plagued by hunger to one
that can now feed more than a billion people, and be a major exporter of food
besides. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#52:1>
It was mercantilism that did it, and to this day China, along
with Taiwan, remains outside the WTO because she refuses to open up her
economy to foreign goods and foreign capital to the extent demanded by that
organization. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#53:1>
It is easily seen that the policies and practices associated with
the mercantilism of the Asian tigers have their roots in the West, and many
of those policies and practices remain in force in the West, the most
prominent of which are the program of agricultural subsidies and the system
of quotas which limit imports to a specified share of the domestic market.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#54:1>
But the one ingredient in the package of mercantilist tools which
the tigers appear to have developed to a point of perfection in terms of its
impact is the mix of state and private capitalism; the combination of private
and state entrepreneurial initiative.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#55:1>
It is this mix that has given the Asian drive toward industrialism
its peculiarly Asian kick. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#56:1>
Recognizing the pressing need to industrialize their economies in
record time, Asian governments have not waited for private capital to
undertake the pioneering mission it performed in the West.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#57:1>
Asian states have invariably taken the initiative to convert feeble
agrarian economies, which the colonial powers bequeathed to them, into
industrial dynamos.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#58:1>
Fully aware that colonialism left them with a shortage of
entrepreneurial skills and private capital resources, Asian states on gaining
their independence had to assume the role of capitalists, industrial pioneers
and business entrepreneurs, and to define the priorities of economic activity
through central planning in order to avoid the wastage of scarce resources
that comes with chaotic, unplanned economies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#59:1>
And in Japan, which was the first Asian state to have
successfully worked out her industrial revolution through a mix of state and
private capitalism, the tigers saw their appropriate model and precedent.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#60:1>
From the history of mercantilism, in the West and in Asia, we see
that there is something much more to that economic doctrine than mere
protectionism.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#61:1>
It is an affirmative strategy for modernizing obsolete economies, and
for spreading the industrial revolution, science and modern technology to
societies that otherwise would remain in the darkness of a pre-industrial
age. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#62:1>
This remarkable doctrine, which came with the nation-state, is
now the target of an international movement bent on eradicating from the face
of the earth and on resurrecting an opposite creed inextricably identified
with one of the darkest periods of human history: the period of western
imperialism, the widespread colonization of peoples, and the deliberate
suppression by the western powers of the industrial revolution in their
colonies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#63:1>
If the Asian crisis has any positive note at all, it is to have
alerted us to the fundamental confrontation of our times. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#64:1>
The repercussions that lurk behind that confrontation are
considerably deadlier than those which lurked behind the ideological
confrontation that was reflected in the Cold War.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#65:1>
It is the confrontation between, on one hand, an economic ideology
that, on historical and contemporary evidence, has done so much to make the
system of nation-states a viable and dynamic vehicle for human progress and,
on the other, an economic ideology whose only function in history has been to
serve as the economic basis of colonialism and the exploitation of peoples.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#66:1>
Free trade in fact has been consistently denounced by the papal
encyclicals since the 1930s, a point which should be brought home to the
<foreign> <it> Opus Dei </it> </foreign> , an agency vigorously pushing for
free trade. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#67:1>
Even as &ldquo; theory, &rdquo; a free trade is an utterly
discredited one, as discredited as the Ptolemaic view that the sun revolves
around the earth.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-017#68:1>
Three earth shaking events before the last world war totally
demolished free trade as an economic &ldquo; doctrine. &rdquo; </p>
