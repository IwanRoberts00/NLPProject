<h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#4:1>
More than ever, the agricultural sector will experience
significant changes and trends in production systems, economics and marketing
of agricultural goods and processed food products.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#5:1>
Rapid population growth in many developing countries, the fast
economic growth and consequently changes in food consumption pattern towards
high meat-low cereal intake in the Southeast Asian region, and the imminent
shift to an international liberalized trade policy will accelerate major
structural changes in the country 's agricultural sector between now and the
turn of the century. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#6:1>
Of the many domestic agricultural products, beef is one commodity
that will greatly be affected by the repercussions of the development within
the ASEAN region due to the above factors which will, in turn, be manifested
through domestic economy-wide, sectoral and institutional policies as well as
international trade agreements.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#7:1>
With the ratification by the government of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade ( GATT), the beef cattle industry, which has remained in
the doldrums for more than a decade now, requires more than just palliative
measures if it is to recover under stiffer market competition. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#8:1>
Because of higher income due to rapid industrialization in the
periphery of the major urban areas, the beef supply has predictably lagged
behind an increasing demand for a product that has a high income demand of
elasticity.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#9:1>
The increasing volume of live cattle and beef importation ( BAS, 1992)
attests not only to an increasing demand for beef, but also to the inability
of the domestic sector to satisfy the demand. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#10:1>
Given this scenario, the government will be under pressure
whether:

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#11:1>
1) to support domestic cattle production or rely more on importation,

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#12:1>
2) to satisfy the interest of the cattle producers or that of the
consumers and

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#13:1>
3) to allow market forces to dictate the price of beef or be
influenced by government intervention. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#14:1>
Any action taken by the government will result in a number of
significant modifications in the production system, feeding management,
breeding and marketing of cattle, to which the commercial producers and big
entrepreneurs are in the best position to respond accordingly.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#15:1>
Unless sound strategies and development plans are drawn, the
smallholder cattle producers will be unable to cope with the forthcoming
changes in the production and marketing of cattle. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#16:1>
Even with the proliferation of biotechnology to improve cattle
productivity, its beneficial effects at the national level will be felt only
in a slow manner.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#17:1>
The long reproductive cycle of cattle and the difficulty in transfer
of novel techniques to small farms contribute largely to the slow progress in
improving the productivity of cattle in the countryside.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#18:1>
It is therefore imperative to draw a long-term innovative master plan
for cattle production to ensure a steady supply of beef and to enable farmers
to augment their unstable income from crops.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#19:1>
The fact that cattle are now in the hands of this sub-sector suggests
that further deterioration of the cattle industry will have its greatest
effect on the well-being of the smallholder farmers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#20:1>
Thus, this paper is an attempt to identify prospects and
opportunities and problems in cattle production and to formulate appropriate
strategies/approaches to promote sustainable cattle production for the
Philippines. </p> <h> <bold> PROSPECTS AND CONSTRAINTS TO CATTLE PRODUCTIVITY
</bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#21:1>
<h> <bold> A. Agroecological </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#22:1>
The Philippine cattle production system is currently at the
&ldquo; pre-industrial &rdquo; stage, i.e. majority of the animals subsist on
valueless resources.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#23:1>
However, a shift toward a higher level of intensification within this
stage of cattle production is expected to materialize due to rapid
urbanization, high demand for beef, stronger purchasing power, decreasing
farm size and increasing farm mechanization, but only if the support services
are available and the policy environment is favorable. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#24:1>
<h> <it> Ranching </it> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#25:1>
Operations in ranching are deemed to become less and less viable
because of problems regarding forest grazing land agreement ( FGLA) which is
formerly known as the pasture lease agreement, unauthorized settlement, low
productivity, lack of infrastructure, and an unfavorable peace and order
condition and social and political environment now faced by ranchers.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#26:1>
Consequently, ranching will become more and more location specific or
concentrated in marginal areas unsuitable to human migration and settlement
and cash crop cultivation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#27:1>
Do we have the comparative advantage with this extensive type of
cattle production system?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#28:1>
With FGLA priced as a relatively cheap primary cattle production
resource at &peso;20.00/ha from only &peso;1.00/ha then, the production
system favored and will continue to favor extensive management practices and
discourage the application of technology or infusion of capital investment as
well as efficient allocation of resources.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#29:1>
While safeguards exist for the proper utilization of leased pastures,
enforcement of the lease agreement provisions is apparently lax based on the
degenerative productivity of the pastures, thus resulting in low cattle
productivity.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#30:1>
Recent data gathered by Marban ( 1995) on the performance of selected
ranches in the provinces of Misamis Oriental and Bukidnon in Northern
Mindanao revealed a stocking rate of as low as 0.25 a.u. / ha, a calving rate
of 54%, calf crop of 52%, and an extraction rate of 21%. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#31:1>
<h> <it> Feedlot </it> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#32:1>
The proliferation of feedlots loaded with imported feeders which is
an aberration of the cattle production trend as a result of an acute supply
problem, will not be sustainable and will be restricted by economy of scale.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#33:1>
Expansion of feedlots will be deterred by three factors namely,
feed shortage, unpredictable supply and environmental concern.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#34:1>
Feedlots are ideally established within an area where there is a
concentrated source of feeds ( pineapple canneries, beer plants, sugar mills
and other agroindustries).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#35:1>
The size of feedlot operation is thus limited by volume of the
potential feeds produced by these industries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#36:1>
Unreliability in supply and unpredictability of price will be
deterrents to expansion of feedlots other than those based on agroindustries.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#37:1>
For example, a severe drought in Australia will increase the price of
the feeder stock the following year.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#38:1>
The concentration of feed wastes and manure poses an environmental
problem since many of the independent feedlots are within the periphery of
urban areas. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#39:1>
<h> <it> Smallholder Cattle Production System </it> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#40:1>
Considering the wide array of appropriate agroecosystems for cattle
production, the socio-economic profile of the country 's rural population and
the national concern for the environment, the potentially sustainable cattle
production system for the Philippines will basically be ( a) smallholder farm
system and ( b) supported by semi-intensive and agroindustrial-based systems
of either feedlot or cow-calf operation ( Sevilla, 1994). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#41:1>
Being an integral part of farming systems, smallholder cattle
production will remain at a low level if the productivity of the crop
sub-system remains low.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#42:1>
Throughout most of Asia, the rural-based ruminant industry has lagged
behind the swine and poultry industry due to the low adoption of technology
and lack of feed resources.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#43:1>
The low productivity of ruminants associated with scarcity of feed
resources will prevail as long as large land areas are tied to crop
production.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#44:1>
This will prohibit the expansion of the feed resource base into
improved pastures, while the cost of by-product concentrates remains high.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#45:1>
The low adoption of cattle production in smallholder farms may be
attributed to the low priority of ruminants in the allocation of the limited
farm resources. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#46:1>
<h> <bold> B. Socioeconomic </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#47:1>
The country 's socioeconomic structure as well as the pre- and
post-production schemes now in place in the rural areas are conducive to
small-holder cattle production.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#48:1>
The existing intrinsic cattle operation schemes in the rural areas,
if strengthened and fully supported by government, can be the starting point
of an organized and efficient smallholder-based cattle production for the
country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#49:1>
The credit scheme, known as <indig> &ldquo; paiwi &rdquo;
</indig> <fnr> <sp> 1 </sp> </fnr> , is working extremely well, giving
resource-poor farmers access to raise animals and therefore contribute to the
efficiency of farm operations.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#50:1>
In Pangasinan, for example, up to 60 animals are loaned out under the
<indig> &ldquo; paiwi &rdquo; </indig> system to individual farmers by a
single rural entrepreneur without cash outlay from the beneficiary and no
interest being charged.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#51:1>
This facility is adopted in many parts of the country and therefore
is indicative of a viable informal non-cash credit scheme compared with
similar programs of the government.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#52:1>
The success of the <indig> &ldquo; paiwi &rdquo; </indig> system
<foreign> vis-&agrave;-vis </foreign> government credit programs may also be
attributed to some cultural values, which should be considered in the
planning stage of a cattle production program.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#53:1>
These successful rural entrepreneurs can be tapped as catalysts or
even conduits of financial and technical services in the implementation of a
countryside cattle production program. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#54:1>
Marketing is a complex factor affecting the cattle industry if
one considers the wide discrepancy between the farm gate price of cattle on
the hoof, the retail cost of beef in the wet market and the big differences
in the prices of cattle in the different regions.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#55:1>
Lack of infrastructure, support services and grading system of
livestock, carcass and meat quality are factors that contribute to
inefficient marketing of the commodities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#56:1>
It is important to look at the supply side of cattle to be able
to appreciate the intricacies and the future of cattle marketing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#57:1>
From 1980 to 1989, beef cattle progressively exhibited a decline
in population as well as in production relative to other economically
important ruminants, i.e. goat and <indig> carabao </indig> ( Table 1).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#58:1>
Compared with the performance for the same species in the whole of
Asia, the country 's cattle industry again lagged behind whereas those of
goats and <indig> carabao </indig> were within the Asian averages.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#59:1>
This is a clear evidence of a serious problem besetting the local
cattle industry, the depletion of the supply of stock. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#60:1>
If any, the most notable change in the beef cattle industry
profile is the marked reduction of the population in the commercial sector by
an average of 9.8% annually from 1983 to 1992 ( Table 2).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#61:1>
Hence, the inventory in the commercial sector now represents only
9.7% of the total population from a high of 22.0% in 1983.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#62:1>
On the other hand, the smallholder sector exhibited a slower decline
in population of only 0.4% over the same period and therefore now holds more
than 90% of the total cattle inventory.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#63:1>
These figures tend to suggest that the two sectors are relatively
independent of each other.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#64:1>
Otherwise, a similar marked reduction in cattle population in the
smallholder farms would have occurred, since it has been presumed that the
commercial cow-calf or ranching operation supplies the bulk of the feeder
stock requirement of the small farms.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#65:1>
This is noteworthy in that it implies stock replenishment within the
smallholder farms. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#66:1>
The number of cattle slaughtered has increased from 17% of the
population in 1983 to as much as 31% in 1990 or an annual slaughter rate of
26% ( Table 3).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#67:1>
Based on these data, it can be deduced that the significant increase
in the number of cattle slaughtered originated from the commercial farms and
that there was no drastic nor unusual unloading of the stock by the
smallholder raisers.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#68:1>
This is in consonance with the observation of a prolonged holding age
of cattle among Asian farmers ( Jarvis, 1982).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#69:1>
The multi-utility of large ruminants other than as singular source of
meat, such as ( a) draft, security and milk, and its ability to survive on
low quality feeds, ( b) a hedge against price fluctuations <foreign>
vis-&agrave;-vis </foreign> the swine and poultry products, and ( c) the
difficulty in acquiring stock replacement, influence the smallholder farmers
to hold on to their large animals unless there is an extreme necessity to
dispose of their stock. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#70:1>
The smallholder sector will therefore remain for a while as a
major source of cattle in the country, hence, development efforts should be
exerted within this sector.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#71:1>
One possible socio-economic constraint will be the perception by the
local producers of the government 's move to indefinitely resort to cattle
and beef importation, which may dampen rural-based cattle production. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#72:1>
<h> <bold> C. Biological </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#73:1>
Feeds and feeding systems, breed improvement, and health and
management practices are the three biological aspects that need particular
attention toward increasing cattle productivity.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#74:1>
However, these disciplines are inseparably intertwined thus making it
impossible to dissociate one discipline from the other in packaging a
specific cattle production system for a given agro-ecosystem.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#75:1>
Often, failure of livestock projects can be traced to incompatibility
among breeds, level of nutrition and appropriate health and management
practices ( Asian Development Bank, 1993).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-029#76:1>
In tropical cattle production, the matching of these resources,
especially the genetic potential of the animal with the available feeds, is
of paramount importance ( Leng, 1989). </p> </I>
