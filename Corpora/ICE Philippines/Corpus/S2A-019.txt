<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#1:1:A>
Good afternoon Philippines <indig> Mabuhay </indig>

And we welcome you back here at the International Broadcast Center <indig> dito po sa </indig> Sydney Australia for the continuing exclusive coverage of People 's Television Network in the on going twenty-seventh Olympiad
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#3:1:A>
<indig> Ngayong hapon mga kaibigan nakita niyo po yung </indig> medal tally <indig> mukhang magiging </indig> exciting <indig> yung labanan ng U S at China dahil tatlong </indig> gold medals <indig> na lang ang uh lamang ng U S sa China </indig> so any time any moment <indig> ay pwedeng uh mapantayan or malampasan ng China ito dahil </indig> on-going <indig> pa rin po ang mga </indig> gold medal matches <indig> dito po sa </indig> twenty-seventh Olympiad
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#4:1:A>
At this point in time <indig> mga kaibigan uh ang ating </indig> coverage <indig> ay ililipat po natin sa </indig> Exhibition Center <indig> sa </indig> downtown Sydney for the on-going uh quarterfinal round of men 's volleyball
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#5:1:A>
<indig> Nandoon po ang ating kasamang si Sev Sarmenta at Maila Gumila upang ibigay sa atin ang </indig> match <indig> ng </indig> Cuba against Russia in the quarterfinals of men 's volleyball

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#6:1:B>
Uh losing the number one rank seeding to Italy in one set to three and finally this team this Russian team gets the second place in pool B in the preliminaries
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#7:1:B>
And Cuba on the other hand is currently in third place in the team standing from the <.> pre </.> preliminary in pool pool A losing uh two matches against Brazil and the Netherlands in three straight sets but winning the matches against Spain in three three sets to one and uh Egypt three straight sets and Australia also in three straight sets
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#8:1:B>
And the winner of this match will end up going up against the winner of the Brazil Argentina match
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#9:1:B>
And here we go <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#10:1:B>
Now you should watch out for Yakolev of Russia number ten and in the Cuban side Dennis Angel Dennis who can really fly Sev

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#11:1:C>
Yes and this is our first sit-in into the men 's competition because of the schedule that we 've followed here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#12:1:C>
And the men 's game <indig> mas mabilis ano <{> <[> mas uh </[> </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#13:1:B>
<[> Yes this is much faster yes </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#14:1:B>
That 's right
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#15:1:B>
This is really fast
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#16:1:B>
And uh you know if you 're used to seeing power volleyball in the women the men 's uh well you know of course it 's expected that it 's gonna be faster because of the power of these uh these guys

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#17:1:C>
So how each one manages the power dealt by each other will be the factor here and you were absolutely correct

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#18:1:B>
Yakolev with that point

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#19:1:C>
<indig> Sobra lumilipad talaga si Yakolev </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#20:1:C>
Yakolev also is quite tall standing six seven

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#21:1:B>
But you know it was really an interesting match these Russians played against the Koreans because uh they really didn't expect that 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#> They almost lost that match

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#22:1:C>
<indig> Sabi mo nga nung </indig> bus trip <indig> natin papunta rito medyo nakakapanghinayang din na nawala yung mga </indig> Koreans because they did quite well <{> <[> in the course of the tournament </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#23:1:B>
<[> Yes yes </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#24:1:B>
And uh last night we we saw that match the Americans going up the Korean women

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#25:1:C>
<indig> Sa </indig> women 's <indig> ano </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#26:1:B>
That was really something else
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#27:1:B>
And uh the Koreans almost got that one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#28:1:B>
And they could have just moved to the <{> <[> semi-finals already </[> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#29:1:C>
<[> Yes </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#30:1:B>
And snatched that one from the Americans

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#31:1:C>
As of the moment this stands at three two in favor of the Russians
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#32:1:C>
However it it 's the Cubans who will be serving

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#33:1:B>
Pavel Pimienta now on your screen to serve

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#34:1:C>
<indig> <{> <[> Tapos agad ang puntos ano </indig> </[> <O> laughter </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#35:1:B>
<[> Oh what a shot </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#36:1:B>
That 's that was Olikhver of Russia

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#37:1:C>
<unclear> words </unclear> <indig> pati yung </indig> first name <indig> niya </indig> Russian <unclear> words </unclear> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#38:1:B>
Jump serve
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#39:1:B>
Go to the right
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#40:1:B>
Strong one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#41:1:B>
What a shot
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#42:1:B>
Osvaldo Hernandez stands six eight
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#43:1:B>
His serve strong one again from Hernandez as Yakolev is easily putting that one over
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#44:1:B>
From the left it 's <.> Den </.> Angel Dennis

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#45:1:C>
The Cuban squad extremely loaded unveiling quickly the arsenal of strength
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#46:1:C>
Now who will be craftier here scrappier perhaps may have the edge
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#47:1:C>
Let 's see let 's let this game flow

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#48:1:B>
Hernandez nice service there
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#49:1:B>
<indig> Alam mo Sev yang si Angel Dennis </indig> uh he 's he is actually short <indig> 'no </indig> he 's uh compared to the other players
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#50:1:B>
He 's just six four but that guy can really hit the ball way up you know he can fly

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#51:1:C>
<indig> Karamihan naman dito talagang lumilipad e </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#52:1:B>
Sometimes uh small but terrible <indig> e di ba </indig> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#53:1:C>
Actually <indig> sa T V mukhang hindi ganun kalaki 'no pero pag katabi ninyo silang nag-aantay kayo ng bus diyan sa labas mukha kaming mga dwende kahit sa </indig> women 's side <indig> ano </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#54:1:B>
That 's true
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#55:1:B>
And the winner from Tetyukhin of Russia

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#56:1:C>
Talk about height <indig> anong </indig> average height <indig> ng </indig> Cuba
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#57:1:C>
Six six

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#58:1:B>
Yeah

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#59:1:C>
<indig> Sa kabilang panig naman </indig> and uh we 'll see this point being played while we check out the average height of the Russian side
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#60:1:C>
The Russian side the average height six seven
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#61:1:C>
That 's tall

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#62:1:B>
Hernandez putting that one away
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#63:1:B>
Going down in the Russian squad is Tetyukhin
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#64:1:B>
Too strong
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#65:1:B>
Here 's the team captain Yosvany Hernandez
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#66:1:B>
<?> That 's a club </?> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#67:1:C>
<indig> Patay na ang puntos oo </indig> 
 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#68:1:B>
Not being able to get that one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#69:1:B>
He was blocked
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#70:1:B>
You know Kazakhov is quite a big quite a tall uh player

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#71:1:C>
Seven one <indig> ano </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#72:1:B>
Oh yeah he is always there you know when you need him to make points but that that error is from Kazakhov 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#73:1:C>
<indig> Alam mo itong sa </indig> international volleyball <indig> ano patuloy na na nare- </indig> redefine <indig> yung </indig> game <indig> dati-dati hindi mo makikita ang mga </indig> seven one <indig> pupunta na ng </indig> basketball <indig> yan </indig> but now <indig> dami nang </indig> seven one <indig> ano </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#74:1:C>
And Russia can like that gentleman on your screens right now
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#75:1:C>
That is the gentleman who stands seven one

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#76:1:B>
Yakolev
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#77:1:B>
It goes to the left down the line
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#78:1:B>
There was there was a touch
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#79:1:B>
The point goes to Cuba
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#80:1:B>
And the score now is eight seven

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#81:1:C>
Because this is the first technical time-out when we reach the level of eight we press the button for the first technical time-out
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#82:1:C>
We 'll use it <,,> <&> break in recording </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#> <indig> Patuloy po ang </indig> Olympic volleyball attack points over the <.> Cub </.> Cubans seeding at an <> efficien </> efficiency rate rather of seventy-five percent
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#83:1:C>
The attack points six to four the edge to the Cubans
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#84:1:C>
<indig> Hindi nagtatagal ang bola walang uh hindi na umiikot ano </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#85:1:C>
<indig> Ang </indig> game is set attack set attack and who overpowers the other is going to be the trend here

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#86:1:B>
That 's men 's volleyball for you
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#87:1:B>
Eight all
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#88:1:B>
Diago <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#89:1:B>
Hammering that down was number six of Cuba Ivan Benito Ruiz Cuesta <,> a long name Sev

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#90:1:C>
<indig> Oo galit siya nung </indig> Grade One <indig> kasi ang daming isusulat na pangalan e </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#91:1:B>
That 's right
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#92:1:B>
From the back that was Tetyukhin swept over by the <w> Cubans' </w> back set

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#93:1:C>
<indig> Huli </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#94:1:C>
Well done

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#95:1:B>
And the Cubans getting that point <,> from the net

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#96:1:C>
Angel Dennis stands six four doing an excellent job of protecting their surface and protecting them from any kind of attack

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#97:1:B>
The Cubans ahead now by two
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#98:1:B>
Back set
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#99:1:B>
That 's in
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#100:1:B>
Great shot <{> <[> <unclear> name </unclear> </[> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#101:1:C>
<[> <indig> Alam mo sa </indig> men 's volleyball </[> </{> <indig> mas nagiging </indig> more valuable <indig> yung </indig> role <indig> nung </indig> <foreign> libero </foreign> <indig> kung minsan yung mga uh </indig> announcers <indig> natin sa </indig> Australia <foreign> libero </foreign> Italian <indig> yan pero itong </indig> <foreign> libero </foreign> <indig> ang gagamitin natin </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#103:1:C>
So <indig> sa </indig> power game <indig> ano importante ang laro ng </indig> <foreign> libero </foreign> <indig> ano </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#104:1:B>
Oh yeah
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#105:1:B>
It is interesting to note that Sev in the women 's team there is no <foreign> libero </foreign> <{> <[> but in the men 's team </[> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#106:1:C>
<[> <indig> Sa </indig> Cuba <indig> sa </indig> Cuba </[> </{>

<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#107:1:B>
There is there is a <foreign> libero </foreign> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#108:1:C>
<indig> Kanya-kanyang </indig> philosophy <indig> e </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#109:1:C>
The Cuban team which is uh going to go up against Brazil in a major major showdown in the women 's category
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#110:1:C>
<{> <[> They 're actually looking for a double <indig> e </indig> </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#111:1:B>
That 's tomorrow

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#112:1:C>
They 're looking for a double 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#> If the women can score because the volleyball program in uh that area <indig> 'no </indig> Cuba Brazil <indig> malutong </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#113:1:C>
Uh Cubans playing well here <indig> ano </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#114:1:B>

<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#115:1:C>
<[> <indig> Malutong </indig> </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#116:1:B>
Single blocking there by Hernandez blocking Yakolev of Russia

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#117:1:C>
As you mentioned the Cubans ending up only in third place in their pool which is pool A dropping two matches and uh anything can happen here because one loss you 're gone

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#118:1:B>
That 's right
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#119:1:B>
<{> <[> Just like last night </[> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#120:1:C>
<[> Yes </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#121:1:B>
The the U S almost lost that match against the Koreans
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#122:1:B>
That 's it <,> Olikhver <,> not successful over the net

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#123:1:C>
<indig> Natutuwa talaga ako dito sa </indig> back-up dancers <indig> yung nasa nagwa- </indig> warm up <indig> sa kanto </indig> endless stretching <indig> yan e ano </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#124:1:B>
Oh yes because they can be called to play <{> <[> anytime </[> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#125:1:C>
<[> Anytime </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#126:1:C>
Anytime they don't occupy the bench <indig> e </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#127:1:C>
<indig> Sa </indig> culture <indig> ng </indig> volleyball <indig> ayaw nilang paupuin lahat ng </indig> players <indig> dun sa </indig> bench area <indig> yun lang pinalitan ipapalit at saka yung mga kailangan lang </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#128:1:B>
And do you know the people who were there at the Phil Sports at the Grand Prix
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#129:1:B>
They 're pretty familiar with that already because they saw they saw Liela Barros there <{> <[> a lot of times </[> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#131:1:C>
<[> <indig> Oo </indig> </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#132:1:B>
Because she hardly played because she had an injury and she wasn't playing at her best

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#133:1:C>
But I think she 's playing very well

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#134:1:B>
Oh she 's playing <{> <[> very well </[> in the Olympics

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#> <[> Her heart out here </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#136:1:C>
<O> laughter </O> Look at these Russians trying to pursue that one

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#137:1:B>
Tetyukhin

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#138:1:C>
Tetyukhin did not want to give up
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#139:1:C>
That was way outside
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#140:1:C>
The Cubans are dictating the flow of this first set fourteen eleven
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#141:1:C>
They are ahead

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#142:1:B>
Here 's Dennis Angel Angel Dennis with uh jump service
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#143:1:B>
Tetyukhin now <,> blocked

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#144:1:C>
<indig> Pero pasok </indig>

<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#145:1:B>
That 's in

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#146:1:C>
<indig> Pasok </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#147:1:B>
Cubans getting another point there fifteen eleven now

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#148:1:C>
Cubans doing a little of everything not allowing the Russians to get any of their cannons firing and uh the Cubans just simply awesome here on the first set

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#149:1:B>
Two teams counterpart of the two best teams here in the world in fact Cuba and Russia in the women 's volleyball
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#150:1:B>
<{> <[> Now we 're seeing the men </[> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#151:1:C>
<[> Service A service A unleashed that time </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#152:1:C>
And the Russian side has fallen behind as we hit our second technical time-out
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#153:1:C>
We will be back <&> break in recording </&> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#154:1:B>
Volleyball quarterfinals you 're seeing Russia against Cuba
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#155:1:B>
You know in attack <.> perce </.> percentage uh seventy-five percent for Cuba and fifty sixty percent for Russia
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#156:1:B>
So Cuba has been hitting a lot of balls there in this first set

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#157:1:C>
And already the Russians have committed two errors
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#158:1:C>
It used to be the Cubans with four and just in about every statistical category the Cubans have the edge and the score reveals and confirms that particular advantage those advantages in fact
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#159:1:C>
<indig> Ang ganda nung </indig> style <indig> nitong si Angel ano uh si Dennis Angel ano </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#160:1:B>
Oh yes

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#161:1:C>
<indig> Sa </indig> side view <indig> muna tapos saka niya pakakawalan </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#162:1:B>
He really has a different or unique kind of uh service
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#163:1:B>
From the back right Hernandez <,> through the blockers of the Russians
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-019#164:1:B>
That 's Hernandez

 <$C>
