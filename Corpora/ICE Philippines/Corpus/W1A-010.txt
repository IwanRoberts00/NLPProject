<h> <bold> ABSTRACT </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#4:1>
Human technology has developed fast through several stages of
innovations and improvements, from simple machines such as levers and pulleys
to complex machines which have their own thinking such as personal computers
and artificial intelligence.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#5:1>
Today, human technology took a greater leap by attempting to add the
essential human quality of emotions to artificial intelligence.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#6:1>
This paper aimed to acquaint the readers with some of the important
points in the budding field of emotion addition to computers.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#7:1>
Data were gathered from journal articles and Internet articles dated
from 1996 up to present.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#8:1>
The articles provided valuable information such as the affecting
reason of this new wave of technology, examples of recently developed systems
and projects under this area, as well as the present problems that
researchers and scientists encounter in pursuing these projects.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#9:1>
These information were then connected, combined, and presented in the
paper. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#10:1>
<h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#11:1>
Continuous evolution happens in every corner of our world today.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#12:1>
And one species has progressed more rapidly than the others, the
human species.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#13:1>
Humans have developed to a great extent that they 've reached
profound stage of knowledge.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#14:1>
This knowledge is powerful enough to make non-living things to
evolve.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#15:1>
One of which is technology.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#16:1>
Technology has changed from very simple machines that humans use in
their simple work to very complex computers, which have their own way of
logical thinking, which they use in their now more multifaceted, thus very
complicated activities.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#17:1>
The logical thinking of the present computers was successfully
patterned from humans ' logical thinking.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#18:1>
And same as the evolution of living things, the technology 's
evolution is in a continuous process.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#19:1>
This time, humans are trying to incorporate to computers another
important aspect they have, emotions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#20:1>
According to Picard as cited by McCauley and Franklin ( 1999), we
have reached a point in the development of computers where we need to study
and utilize the abandoned role of emotion.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#21:1>
Scientists and researchers think that emotions should be added to
computers because it was found out that emotions play a critical role in
rational and intelligent behavior [ PICA, ETAL01].

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#22:1>
Furthermore, several studies have supported the claim that emotions
have a significant role in decision-making and performance as well [
KORT&REIL02].

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#23:1>
In addition, the integration of emotions to computers would help
produce more believable artificial intelligence, which humans could use in
their work [ PERR96]. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#24:1>
Due to these findings, several projects and systems have been
developed for this field.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#25:1>
However, researchers are still discontented with these models.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#26:1>
They attributed this production of shallow models with the
difficulties encountered in this new field.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#27:1>
Despite the many difficulties in the development of artificial
intelligence with emotions, several researchers and projects are still being
done in this field in order to build a better relationship between humans and
computers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#28:1>
This paper presents some of the important points in the field of
emotion addition to computers.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#29:1>
This paper focuses on the purposes of emotion addition to computers.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#30:1>
It also discusses some of the recent systems and projects being
developed in this field.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#31:1>
And also, the some of the difficulties researchers encounter in
developing these systems and projects. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#32:1>
<h> <bold> THE ROLE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN HUMAN-COMPUTER
RELATIONSHIP </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#33:1>
Our technology has shown a great development in the past years.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#34:1>
This flourishing technology has a primary purpose of rendering human
users with a more efficient and convenient work environment.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#35:1>
Thus, each and every step in any technological development aims to
bring more convenience to human users. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#36:1>
An example is the step-by-step development of the personal
computers we have today.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#37:1>
The very first computers were built to assist humans in their
computations.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#38:1>
However, humans have a wide variety of works and activities aside
from doing computations such as photo editing, document editing, and even
program development.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#39:1>
Thus, the computer systems were slowly innovated to accommodate these
activities.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#40:1>
This can be clearly seen in the personal computers or desktops we
have in our homes and offices today.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#41:1>
People are now really dependent on our technology.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#42:1>
Some may see their computers as their best friends and interact with
them like the way they interact with humans. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#43:1>
This attitude may be justified by the connection between a
human-human relationship and human-computer relationship.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#44:1>
Picard ( 2000a) presents the idea that a connection exists between
the two in the sense that the factors, which affect human-human relationship,
are also the factors, which affect human-computer relationship.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#45:1>
Correspondingly, as Picard stated, one of these factors in a
human-human relationship is emotional intelligence. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#46:1>
To be emotionally intelligent, a person should be able to
recognize the emotions of the other person and be able to give an appropriate
response to them [ PICA00a].

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#47:1>
The acquisition of this ability is said to play a very important role
in the process of learning.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#48:1>
Also, it can influence a person 's capability of meeting important
parts of his or her life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#49:1>
Furthermore, it also has a role in the field of medicine and
entertainment [ PICA, ETAL01].

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#50:1>
Since emotional intelligence is a very influential factor in a
human-human relationship, it is also considered as an important factor in a
human-computer relationship.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#51:1>
This analogy drives scientists and researchers to work in the
production of agents and systems, which are emotionally intelligent.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#52:1>
For them, the incorporation of emotions to artificial intelligence
paves the way for a better interaction between human users and computers.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#53:1>
As humans become more and more dependent on computers, they begin
to entrust them with very important jobs.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#54:1>
However, some human activities produce a lot of questions when
entrusted to computers because they are said to be for humans only.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#55:1>
Examples of these are babysitting and counseling. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#56:1>
When a mother leaves her child in the care of a babysitter, this
means that the mother trusts the babysitter.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#57:1>
Actually, in a human-human relationship, every person must have to
trust another person if he or she leaves something valuable to him or her.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#58:1>
This trust may arise from the thought that the other person knows how
to take care of something valuable meaning that the caretaker should have
enough knowledge about it and should be able to efficiently apply this
knowledge in his or her work.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#59:1>
This ability includes not only the use of intelligence but also the
use of emotions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#60:1>
Since present systems and agents are already incorporated with
artificial intelligence, the problem is that of emotions.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#61:1>
If artificially intelligent agents could show signs of emotions,
human users might be able to entrust them with the mentioned activities
because the users might feel that the agents have the ability to understand
them.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#62:1>
In the process, trust would be built in the human-computer
relationship. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#63:1>
In interacting with computers, human users could feel different
emotions.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#64:1>
Some of the most commonly felt emotions in human-computer interaction
are negative in nature.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#65:1>
Examples are frustration, irritation, and other stress-related
feelings [ PICA01a].

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#66:1>
These negative emotions may arise from the dissatisfaction of the
user to the computer.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#67:1>
The presence of these negative feelings might cause more problems in
a human-computer relationship.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#68:1>
A possible solution to this problem is for the computers to have
emotions or recognize the user 's emotions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#69:1>
An advantage of making the computer recognize the user 's emotion
is that it can try out different possible responses to the user.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#70:1>
This can be done by determining which response is the most pleasing.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#71:1>
In this view, the computer must also be able to sense user feedbacks
[ PICA01b]. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#72:1>
These responses to the users may help the users to manage their
emotional state.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#73:1>
For example, when a user suddenly experiences frustration because of
the slow data processing of a computer, the emotionally intelligent computer
may lessen the user 's frustration by giving an apologetic message or by
improving the speed of its data processing.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#74:1>
In this process, information where the users feel frustrated may be
collected and be sent to system developers for them to use in performance
improvement.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#75:1>
The improvements made may positively contribute in building a better
human-computer relationship. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#76:1>
<h> <bold> RECENT DEVELOPED SYSTEMS OR PROJECTS OF COMMUNICATING
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WITH EMOTIONS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#77:1>
In line with the challenge of successfully adding emotions to
artificial intelligence, several recent projects and systems are being
developed.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#78:1>
These include both hardware and software tools, which enables the
computer to sense emotions and its patterns. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#79:1>
The projects and systems are classified under two main
categories.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#80:1>
These two main categories are the <mention> &ldquo; self-report
system &rdquo; </mention> and <mention> &ldquo; concurrent expression system
&rdquo; </mention> [ PICA00a]. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#81:1>
The first category is the &ldquo; self-report system".

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#82:1>
Projects and systems under this category provide the user with a set
of choices through words or icons, or hardware input devices for the user to
convey his or her emotions [ PICA00a].

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#83:1>
Whenever the user feels a certain emotion, he or she can relay it to
the system by selecting one of the choices.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#84:1>
Each and every item in the selection represents a certain emotion.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#85:1>
This category primarily gives the user with awareness on the
message he or she will give out to the computer [ PICA00a].

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#86:1>
This ability of the system serves as its advantage over the other
category, which will be discussed later.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#87:1>
If the user has a full conscious control over his or her message, the
input emotion would be more or less accurate because the one who experienced
it has chosen it himself or herself.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#88:1>
In addition, the user could just give the computer only the type of
emotion he or she wants. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#89:1>
However, this also serves as its disadvantage in the sense that
the user 's main task being performed is interrupted [ PICA00a].

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#90:1>
If the user needs to convey his or her emotions to the computer in a
certain situation, the user has to stop what he or she is doing for him or
her to be able to choose from the set of words, icons, or other input
devices.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#91:1>
As a result, the user is distracted from his main activity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#92:1>
An example of a project, which uses the &ldquo; self-report
system', is the <mention> &ldquo; thumbs-up feedback &rdquo; </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#93:1>
This system is attached to a machine, which provides consumers with
ready-made coffee [ PICA00a].

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#94:1>
This system includes two choices, namely the thumbs-up and
thumbs-down icons.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#95:1>
Whenever the user is satisfied with the produced coffee of the
system, the user can just tap the thumbs-up icon to let the computer know of
his or her satisfaction.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#96:1>
On the other hand, the thumbs-down icon can be tapped whenever the
user is dissatisfied with the system 's performance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#97:1>
Another example of a project under this category is the ASQ or
Affective Social Quotient.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#98:1>
This project intends to aid autistic children in expressing and
communicating their emotions in different situations [ PICA01a].

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#99:1>
The system executes this by showing the children chosen videos, which
could arouse different emotions.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#100:1>
For the child to communicate his or her emotion, he or she could
pick one or more dwarfs in the choices.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#101:1>
Each dwarf denotes an emotion being studied. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#102:1>
The other category used in the development of systems and
projects of artificial intelligence with emotions is the &ldquo; concurrent
expression system".

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#103:1>
Systems under this category can sense emotions with the help of
different sensors.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#104:1>
The type of sensor to be used will be up to the user 's decision or
choice [ PICA00a]. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#105:1>
As stated earlier, one disadvantage of the &ldquo; self-report
system &rdquo; is the frequent interruption of the user 's main task just to
communicate his or her emotion [ PICA00a].

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#106:1>
The solution to this problem is provided by the second category.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#107:1>
In this category, the sensors remove the user 's impediment in
communicating his or her emotion because the sensors perceive emotions
independently [ PICA00a].

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#108:1>
In this way, the user doesn't need to stop what her or she is doing
in order to relay what he or she feels. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#109:1>
However, this does not mean that the second category has no
hindering difficulty.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#110:1>
This category is far from being perfect.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#111:1>
It still has a disadvantage for the users.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#112:1>
And this is connected with the issue of privacy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#113:1>
Privacy is one of the most treasured ideas of individuals.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#114:1>
This, however, is said to be hindered with the use of the systems
and projects under this category.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-010#115:1>
Users might feel uneasy with the thought of having a machine sense
his or her feelings [ PICA00a]. </p> ... </I>
