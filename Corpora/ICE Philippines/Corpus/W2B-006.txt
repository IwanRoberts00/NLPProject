<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#3:1>
THE LOCAL art conservation movement has received a modest boost
with the recent visit of two Spanish experts from the <mention> <foreign>
Curator Conservacion Restauracion de Madrid </foreign> </mention> , the
highly respected institute making forays into restoration and conservation in
developing countries like the Philippines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#4:1>
Starting Sept. 1, Maria Hita Bojahar and Emilio Mezcua Santamaria
conducted an intensive, hands-on seminar-workshop on painting and polychrome
restoration and conservation at the College of Architecture and Fine Arts (
Cafa) of the University of Santo Tomas. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#5:1>
Brought here through the initiative of Fr. Isidro Abano, O.P., the
Cafa regent and director of the UST Museum of Arts and Sciences, the two
Spaniards had been so moved by the enthusiastic response of Cafa professors
and students that they extended the five-day course up to last week. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#6:1>
Participants received a certificate from the institute that would
vouch for their having mastered the rudiments of restoration and
conservation, enough for them to pass on the knowledge to others.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#7:1>
( Father Abano and Cafa Dean Yolanda Reyes are strengthening the
restoration and conservation component of the fine arts curriculum of UST;
moreover, the former has recommended to the UST Office of Academic Affairs
and the UST Graduate School the introduction of a Diplomate on Museology to
professionalize museum personnel in the Philippines). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#8:1>
The importance of the seminar-workshop cannot be underestimated.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#9:1>
While museums and art faculties have to send only their most select
men to Europe to take part in one-month certificate courses in restoration
and conservation, often at costs that put further pressure on already taxed
budgets, the UST initiative - - of importing experts to do the training here
with larger classes - - was brilliant and cost-efficient.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#10:1>
It also &ldquo; localized &rdquo; European methods of restoration and
made them more responsive to Philippine needs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#11:1>
At the UST workshop, in fact, professors and students applied
what they had learned from Bojahar and Santamaria 's lectures by restoring
items from the famed UST Museum collection.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#12:1>
Under the guidance of the two Spanish experts, the participants
checked the flaky outgrowth in two Botong Francisco paintings, tidied up
Felix Resurrection Hidalgo 's <mention> &ldquo; <foreign> Costas de Normandia
</foreign> , &rdquo; </mention> removed the coastal shelf of dirt and mold
from an 18th-century portrait of a UST rector <foreign> magnificus </foreign>
of that era, and cleaned and trimmed the twisted horse mane that passed off
for hair of a <foreign> <it> santo </it> </foreign> mildewed by the
centuries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#13:1>
The restored works were later put up in an exhibit at the UST
Museum that was formally opened on Sept. 8 by Ignacio Cabria, the chancellor
of the Spanish Embassy, and Angelita Cruz, wife of construction magnate F. F.
Cruz.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#14:1>
The show runs until Sept. 22. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#15:1>
Through restoration, UST fine arts professors were able to
discover certain things.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#16:1>
Prof. Jaime de los Santos said that canvases used in the 18th and
19th centuries appeared more built to last, while those of the 20th century
were ephemeral.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#17:1>
<quote> &ldquo; It reveals the <indig> <it> pwede-na </it> </indig>
mentality of the 20th century, &ldquo; </quote> he rued.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#18:1>
Prof. Rhoda Recto learned that she has to mix consistently her paint
next time she takes up her brush in order to ensure that her canvas will
last. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#19:1>
<h> <bold> Restoration tips </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#20:1>
The restoration was no easy matter.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#21:1>
<quote> &ldquo; This work does not require you to hurry, you must do
it patiently, &rdquo; </quote> the two experts told the participants.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#22:1>
In fact, the reason the seminar-workshop lasted up to last week was
because the process was often painstaking and careful. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#23:1>
<quote> &ldquo; We 're trying to cram a process that we have
learned and mastered in 15 years in just five days, &rdquo; </quote> the two
complained during the workshop.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#24:1>
That, and the enthusiasm of Bojahar and Santamaria to share their
knowledge with the equally eager participants. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#25:1>
In fact, Father Abano expressed surprise that the Madrid duo had
been so generous in sharing their expertise, even revealing certain trade
secrets.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#26:1>
In Italy, where Abano specialized on sacred art and the church 's
cultural patrimony, one-month certificate courses on restoration usually
scrimp on revelations.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#27:1>
In contrast, his Spanish guests had been <quote> &ldquo; unselfish
and really eager to be of help." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#28:1>
Bojahar and Santamaria 's generosity can be better appreciated if
one considers that they mastered their discipline after much difficulty and
sacrifice.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#29:1>
The two came from diverse though not antipodal backgrounds. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#30:1>
Bojahar earned her diplomate on easel restoration at the
<mention> <foreign> Escuela Superior de Conservacion y Restauracion de Madrid
</foreign> </mention> , where she also got a second diplomate on book
restoration.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#31:1>
She also specialized in molding and excavation at the <mention>
<foreign> Escuela de Artes y Oficios </foreign> </mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#32:1>
Santamaria, on the other hand, is a senior industrial engineer.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#33:1>
He has since worked as a partner and technical assistant to Bojahar
in the restoration and conservation of organic materials, devising the
laboratory processes and the analytical proofs for the work. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#34:1>
In 1985, the two were commissioned by the <mention> <foreign>
Museo de America de Madrid </foreign> </mention> to restore Indian basket and
leather artifacts from Spain 's <foreign> conquistador </foreign> days in the
Americas.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#35:1>
But the work was made doubly hard by the lack of published materials
on the artifacts: without any working knowledge of them in their original
form, they did not have any rudimentary conception of the scope of the
restoration. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#36:1>
The partners had to operate by taking short and careful but
highly experimental steps.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#37:1>
As a result, it took them three months to restore two meters of
buffalo hide with ceremonial paintings on them by the plains Indians of North
America. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#38:1>
By persistence, imagination and experimentation, the two were
able to develop chemicals and certain approaches to restoration.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#39:1>
<quote> &ldquo; We encountered problems that were common and thereby
devised measures to deal with them, &rdquo; </quote> they say. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#40:1>
Their hard work paid off.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#41:1>
At the 1994 Brussels Fair of International Inventors, Bojahar won the
<mention> <foreign> Premio Eureka </foreign> ( Gold Medal) </mention> and a
<mention> Special Jury Mention </mention> for her &ldquo; <mention> <foreign>
<it> Metodo para el tratamiento de la recuperacion de las pieles </it>
</foreign> </mention> . &rdquo; </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#42:1>
<h> <bold> Care and discernment </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#43:1>
The approach included the use of restoration creams and drugs
that she and Santamaria concocted.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#44:1>
She also got a special award for the same method from the chamber of
inventors of Spain. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#45:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Our innovative products are nontoxic, they 're
not acidic, &rdquo; </quote> Santamaria said.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#46:1>
<quote> &ldquo; They do not affect adversely the original work.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#47:1>
They allow, for instance, for the removal of dirt from a painting or
sculpture without affecting the varnish or original color.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#48:1>
They leave the work as they are. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#49:1>
Although <mention> <foreign> Curator </foreign> </mention> claims
special expertise with ethnographic materials, it also has mastery of
painting and polychrome, as well as document restoration.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#50:1>
Recently, they restored the original <foreign> magna carta </foreign>
of Costa Rica ( at one time during the UST seminar, an official of the Manila
Archdiocesan Archives dropped by to get some tips on conserving the local
church 's ancient manuscripts). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#51:1>
After their Philippine stint, they will go back to Spain to
resume a work commissioned by the University of Alcala to restore 2,000
ancient fans, including oriental fans, as well as reconstruct the old tiles
of the floor of the grand hall of the antique center of learning. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#52:1>
Asked if there 's a unique <mention> <foreign> Curator </foreign>
&ldquo; technique, &rdquo; </mention> they insisted that what is required of
any restorer and conservator are care and discernment.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#53:1>
<quote> &ldquo; <mention> <foreign> Curator </foreign> </mention>
tries to determine what is really the nature of a work and only then
determine what method to use, &rdquo; </quote> they explained. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#54:1>
Restoration, Bojahar and Santamaria insisted, should follow the
basic principle of &ldquo; reversibility. &rdquo;

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#55:1>
This means that any restoration work must have the makings of its own
undoing to give way to an approach that can better fashion the original
lineaments of a work.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#56:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Nothing should be final with restoration, &rdquo;
</quote> they say.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#57:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Everything should be reversible. &rdquo; </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#58:1>
In the UST workshop, for instance, watercolor was used to restore
certain damaged portions of Botong Francisco 's <mention> &ldquo; <indig>
Harana </indig> </mention> . &rdquo;

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#59:1>
Should the color used be proven later to be not faithful to the
master 's original spirit, then it could be removed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#60:1>
As an example of good restoration, the two Spaniards praised the
work done on the Sistine Chapel.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#61:1>
According to them, the restoration yielded the original colors of
Michelangelo: &ldquo; <foreign> <it> el color limpio </it> </foreign> ,
&rdquo; that is, clear, bright and pristine.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#62:1>
In the process, they say, Michelangelo 's dramatic and colossal
figures came out. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#63:1>
<h> <bold> Complex and elaborate </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#64:1>
But restoration, they said, is complex and elaborate. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#65:1>
At the UST workshop, the restoration of G. Cordero 's 1941
<mention> &ldquo; The Philippine <foreign> Angelus </foreign> &ldquo;
</mention> - - its big canvas having suffered from poor storage and
insect-infestation - - was made doubly difficult by the rough brush strokes
of the painter that deeply ingrained the dirt that had accumulated through
the decades. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#66:1>
Even the cotton used to initially wipe the dirt off was caught in
the canvas and had to be removed by a special emulsion.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#67:1>
Some of the dirt appeared to be a cloud of white dust that was
detected by ultraviolet rays trained by the Spanish experts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#68:1>
Aside from cotton, the participants used a double brush to gently
wipe the canvas.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#69:1>
The cleaning used special <mention> <foreign> Curator </foreign>
</mention> creams and concoctions.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#70:1>
Then animal glue brewed in a special manner by <mention> <foreign>
Curator </foreign> </mention> was applied to the work - - or portions of it
that needed repair or reconstruction - - and then covered with special
cellulose paper ( onion skin and <foreign> <it> papel de japon </it>
</foreign> were good substitutes). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#71:1>
The work was left to dry for 24 hours.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#72:1>
Afterward, tepid water was used to remove the cellulose, and the
final work was a work restored to much of its original sheen.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#73:1>
Some portions was left unrestored for instruction purposes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#74:1>
The same process more or less was observed in restoring Botong
Francisco 's <mention> &ldquo; Give Us This Day &rdquo; </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#75:1>
To check for flaking, parts of it were applied with animal glue then
overlaid with onion skin.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#76:1>
The paper was then ironed to the canvas with a small soldering iron
of 30 watts.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#77:1>
Damp water was then applied to remove the paper and <mention> Oleo
</mention> , a special <mention> <foreign> Curator </foreign> </mention>
cream, to dislodge dirt and dust, yielding Botong 's brilliant colors and
provoking the class of wannabe restorers and conservators to cheers of
triumph, joyous as they were at every small victory achieved over the talons,
of time, neglect, dirt and desuetude. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#78:1>
Such small victories should be repeated elsewhere - - in our
other vanishing works of artistic, cultural and historical patrimony.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#79:1>
The work won't be easy, warned Bojahar and Santamaria.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#80:1>
For one, there 's the lack of awareness.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#81:1>
In fact, they said the European conservation movement is relatively
young - - only in the last 40 years or so has it gained headway.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#82:1>
Even then, the consciousness of the need to conserve the decaying
hallmarks of western civilization had been forming earlier, although it
yielded concrete fruits only later.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#83:1>
That consciousness still needs to be evolved in the Philippines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#84:1>
But while evolution takes time, patrimonial disintegration has
been radical and fast.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#85:1>
That is especially true of the Philippines, according to Bojahar and
Santamaria, because it is a tropical country.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#86:1>
As a rule, they say, excessive temperatures and extreme humidity and
dryness are unkind to documents and artifacts.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#87:1>
Adding to the nemeses of our cultural artifacts are bugs, moths,
fungi and pollution.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#88:1>
Thus, the enemies of our patrimony are both man-made and natural.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#89:1>
But even nature 's punishments can be tamed by effective man-made
interventions.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#90:1>
Although Bojahar and Santamaria admit that lack of money is
problematic for any conservation campaign, a government worth its salt and
mindful of the national interest should make restoration and conservation a
priority.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#91:1>
They suggest the creation of a <mention> National Institute for
Restoration and Conservation </mention> to foster a healthy consciousness
among the populace to preserve the showcases of their civilization, as well
as competently deal with the challenges of conservation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#92:1>
Initially, they say, a country trying to put into work a viable
conservation establishment needs to hire or import experts to teach its
people the ropes.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#93:1>
But the end-view should be the formation of <foreign> <it> el pais
</it> </foreign> - - that is, a professional core of locals who can do the
restoration themselves. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#94:1>
In that case, the UST workshop is significant.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#95:1>
By coming here, like Magellan and the missionaries, from the other
side of the globe to teach Filipinos highly prized techniques of restoration
and conservation, Bojahar and Santamaria laid the groundwork for a truly
native and Filipino cultural conservation movement that will preserve for
posterity the hallmarks of its civilization, a civilization which,
incidentally, got its soul from Spain.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-006#96:1>
With the visit of <mention> <foreign> Curator </foreign> </mention> ,
the Philippines and Spain have entered a new chapter in their colorful
relationship. </p> </I>
