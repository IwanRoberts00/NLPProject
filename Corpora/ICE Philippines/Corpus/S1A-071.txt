 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#1:1:A>
Uhm next question what do you think is the more effective review method the self-study approach or or what 's this or the <.> form </.> and the formal thing where you go to class and all of you review

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#2:1:B>
Self-study or class

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#3:1:C>
I think it 's important to have a mixture of both

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#4:1:B>
What did you do

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#5:1:C>
Uh self-review and then go to the review class but actually what I did <indig> e </indig> I chose the subjects where I was weakest and so with those subjects where I 've not had a good background I would attend review classes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#6:1:C>
<indig> Pero </indig> those subjects where I felt I I had a strong background I studied it on my own and then I just referred to the notes which my other batchmates <.> ha </.> took when they attended review classes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#7:1:C>
But I think uh most people no I think most people I know who really did well in the bar exams they studied on their own

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#8:1:D>
Oh

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#9:1:C>
Yeah

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#10:1:D>
That 's what I did I just attended the preview

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#11:1:C>
Yeah you were always in the gym

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#12:1:D>
No I know I regret that now but uh <O> laughter </O> I was uh I I studied at my own pace decided not to keep up with everybody and yes because I wanted to do other things while I was reviewing
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#13:1:D>
And then I attended the pre-week pre-week is that week right before the Sunday that 's where they give you the areas which uh <.> poss </.> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#14:1:C>
They feel

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#15:1:D>
Yeah from which possible questions may arise and which they feel you must concentrate on

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#16:1:B>
Examiners may change every year <indig> 'no </indig> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#17:1:C>
Yeah

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#18:1:D>
Yes

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#19:1:B>
You have no way of knowing who the examiners will be

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#20:1:D>
<{> <[> Next </[> year no

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#21:1:C>
<[> No </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#22:1:C>
We don't even know the examiners now <{> <[> we </[> only have guesses

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#23:1:D>
<[> Now </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#24:1:D>
We only have guesses we don't know for sure who they are

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#25:1:C>
Like we just know the chairman of course because he 's Justice Davide
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#26:1:C>
He 's appointed by the the <indig> kwan 'no </indig> by the Chief Justice

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#27:1:D>
Chief Justice appoints <{> <[> the </[> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#28:1:C>
<[> Appoints him </[> </{> and then usually it 's the most junior justice who becomes the head of the Bar Exams Committee and then the Chairman Justice Davide chose the examiners
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#29:1:C>
Rumor has it that he chose some of his <indig> kwan </indig> his close friends Cebuanos so political law

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#30:1:D>
I well I don't know I don't really care

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#31:1:C>
So we have guesses like rumors <indig> na naman </indig> and you rely on rumors
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#32:1:C>
Usually some of these rumors are really true
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#33:1:C>
Like last year I know that they anticipated it that Pascual <{> <[> will be the examiner </[> for labor

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#34:1:D>
<[> Yes yes </[> </{> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#35:1:C>
So a lot of people really prepared for that exam

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#36:1:D>
Yes

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#37:1:C>
'Cause he 's very exacting <indig> e </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#38:1:C>
He wants you to to phrase it phrase the law accurately and he has his own way he has his buzz words
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#39:1:C>
<{> <[> If you don't write down </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#40:1:B>
<[> What 's buzz words </[> </{> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#41:1:C>
Words that he thinks are important

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#42:1:B>
Ahhh

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#43:1:C>
Things are you know which <,> you give it a specific meaning
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#44:1:C>
So he wants those buzz words so they had to study his book and he was really the examiner

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#45:1:B>
These people are they have they become your teachers before

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#46:1:C>
Pascual was my teacher

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#47:1:D>
He teaches in U P so uh

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#48:1:C>
Some of them like our senior partner

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#50:1:D>
What

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#51:1:C>
Rene Cayetano was the examiner

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#52:1:D>
Rene Cayetano the <{> <[> senior partner of this firm </[> yeah in nineteen eighty-nine

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#53:1:C>
Labor also

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#55:1:B>
Uhm

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#56:1:D>
Labor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#57:1:B>
Eighty-nine

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#58:1:D>
Nineteen eighty-nine

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#59:1:C>
Most of them didn't know even Pia because Pia is my batchmate or classmate
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#60:1:C>
<{> <[> She 's the daughter </[> of Rene

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#61:1:D>
<[> His daughter </[> </{> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#62:1:C>
And before the nineteen eighty- <?> nine </?> bar exams there were rumors that he was the bar examiner but Pia was saying of course not if he was the bar examiner I 'm good at I should know this is my Dad he didn't tell us <unclear> word </unclear> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#63:1:B>
Uhm do you think that like you need <indig> parang </indig> you need to devote like a part of the test to psychological exams also <indig> parang </indig> just to <indig> parang </indig> you know to know if <&> speakers C and D speak at the same time </&> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#64:1:C>
If you don't have the right frame of mind if you 're

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#65:1:B>
You won't do it

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#66:1:C>
You you can't you can't do well in that exam you it requires a lot of mental <.> energ </.> <indig> ano 'yon </indig> mental well-being <indig> e </indig> just to survive that exam

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#67:1:B>
And there <unclear> words </unclear> perhaps also

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#68:1:C>
Yeah

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#69:1:D>
The tension and the <{> <[> pressure </[> create the psychological tensions that uh normally

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#70:1:C>
<[> Pressure </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#71:1:C>
Break anybody <{> <[> who 's not </[> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#72:1:D>
<[> Yeah yeah </[> </{> they would <.> unrav </.> yes of course and <{> <[> of course </[> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#73:1:C>
<[> And there were </[> </{> cases right

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#74:1:D>
Yes people cracked after the

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#75:1:B>
Uh yeah

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#76:1:D>
During the exam itself
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#77:1:D>
They break down and cry

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#78:1:C>
Or they drink ink

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#79:1:D>
Or they <{> <[> scream </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#80:1:B>
<[> Oh </[> </{> <{> <[> you 're kidding </[> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#82:1:C>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> there are some girls <unclear> word </unclear> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#83:1:D>
<{> <[> No uh </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#84:1:B>
<[> During your </[> </{> exam

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#85:1:C>
Yeah during our exam

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#86:1:D>
What do I didn't know anything about that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#87:1:D>
I remember about the <{> <[> girl </[> who <indig> ano </indig> who had to be carried out in a stretcher

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#88:1:C>
<[> Well </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#89:1:C>
Uh no I didn't know about that but I knew about the girl who drank the ink because my classmate was her roommate

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#90:1:D>
Uh

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#91:1:C>
We were so <unclear> words </unclear> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#92:1:D>
Oh many of those every year anyway uh law school should be the primary meeting of uh <unclear> word </unclear> like we start out in Ateneo we start out with five classes we only graduate two <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#93:1:D>
So there there you should already get the <{> <[> the </[> wackos out

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#94:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#95:1:D>
But seeing if you look at many practitioners <indig> na </indig> you see plenty of weirdoes walking around also that means that <,> uh the practice of law and schizophrenia are not necessarily incompatible <indig> 'no </indig> <O> laughter </O> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#96:1:C>
In fact when I when I was in my freshman year <,> we had this batchmate turned out to be a wacko <,> she turned out to be insane
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#97:1:C>
At first we but she 's very intelligent <{> <[> <indig> e </indig> and she </[> writes really good in in poems

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#98:1:D>
<[> Uh uhm yeah </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#99:1:B>
Poems

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#100:1:C>
It turned out we thought she was just weird she was just an artist

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#101:1:B>
Yeah <indig> parang </indig> eccentric

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#102:1:C>
Until she started fantasizing about burning a classmate <{> <[> or </[> saying that she was the wife of a certain person
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#104:1:C>
And then she 's being pursued by <.> th </.> the New People 's Army and the Yellow Army and what was this the clincher was that she was the daughter of Jackie Onassis 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#103:1:B>
<[> Uh uhm </[> </{> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#105:1:D>
Uh

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#106:1:C>
Yeah that was the clincher
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#107:1:C>
She would stay out in the rain and then <indig> oy </indig> <@> Chari </@> come in you 're going to be you 're going to get sick <indig> sabi niya </indig> no I 'm used to the cold I was born in Connecticut and my mother was Jackie Onassis until Cory Aquino kidnapped me and brought me to this damned wretched place <indig> ganon </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#108:1:C>
But when they found out she was you know mentally off-balanced
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#109:1:C>
It was really true <indig> ha </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#110:1:C>
She passed the entrance exam she passed the interview with flying colors and she turned out to be

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#111:1:D>
Did they ask her to leave

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#112:1:C>
They did

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#113:1:D>
Uh I see
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#114:1:D>
Because you 'll pass the bar even if you 're crazy as long as you autistic people can take that bar and pass it <,> and then uh well whether uh whether he is qualified to be a lawyer or not later on <,> is decided by what either the clients who choose him or

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#115:1:C>
Firm that he works for

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#116:1:D>
Yeah people who would like to commit him later on <unclear> word </unclear> crazy that bar exam is not going to indicate <,> your psychological world view

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#117:1:B>
Uh uhm <,> uhm <,,> Joyce you wanna choose a question

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#118:1:A>
Uhm okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#119:1:A>
It says that quality of preparation you underwent do you think that having been educated in an elite and <indig> di ba yung </indig> elite institution gave you an edge over other like other aspirants

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#120:1:C>
That 's what I thought the bar exam <,> it was an equalizer some sort 'cause nothing <indig> ewan ko </indig> feeling <indig> nga </indig> nothing ever prepares you for the bar exams <indig> e </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#121:1:C>
<indig> Kasi </indig> it 's not it 's not the usual <indig> di ba yung </indig> the technique what do you call that in teaching that you have one professor and then you learn from him <{> <[> <indig> parang </indig> </[> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#122:1:D>
<[> Socratic </[> </{> method

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#123:1:C>
No no it 's the <,> <.> Pavlo </.> <.> quer </.> <?> query query </?> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#124:1:C>
What do you call that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#125:1:B>
<.> Pedag </.> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#126:1:D>
Pedagogic

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#127:1:C>
Yeah pedagogic method <indig> na </indig> you <indig> parang </indig> you share the same universe <indig> di ba </indig> that there 's one teacher the teaching is not it 's not that way <indig> e di ba </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#128:1:C>
It 's this outside you 're a stranger who didn't teach you anything who 's going to choose the question
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#129:1:C>
Now your his universe is different from yours <,> like you may be <.> ha </.> have been taught different things like in U P <indig> kasi </indig> <,> I 've noticed <,> we were taught the <indig> kwan e </indig> complex questions <indig> yung </indig> <,> each question must you must you must analyze it because it 's not as easy as it seems <indig> na parang </indig> you don't trust a simple question <indig> ganon na </indig> you always think no there is a trick in this 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#130:1:C>
<indig> Kaya </indig> during the bar exam I was I was also thinking <indig> ganoon </indig> no this question is too easy there must be a catch <indig> ganyan ganyan 'yun pala </indig> <,> it was just it was just <{> <[> simple </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#131:1:B>
<[> Simple </[> </{> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#132:1:C>
Just asking me uh you know a fundamental question but I answered in a complex way

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#133:1:B>
Uhm 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#134:1:C>
So you see the training is different and the emphasis is different
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#135:1:C>
So that 's the <,> <{> <[> that 's the problem </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#136:1:B>
<[> Did you you have </[> </{> to do some adjustment then <{> <[> when you </[> get there

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#137:1:C>
<[> Yes </[> </{> yes

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#139:1:D>
<&> speaker B says something but unclear </&> Well I thought that uh <,> going to my school was worth the trouble and the expense because no the bar exam is a measure of basic knowledge they 're not supposed to measure uh unusual or obscure uh questions of law
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#140:1:D>
Now that basic knowledge is something like a common universe all lawyers must share see if you don't know that then you should not become a lawyer
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#141:1:D>
<{> <[> That 's the </[> whole logic of the bar exam

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#142:1:C>
<[> Yeah but </[> </{> is the writ of Amparo

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#144:1:D>
Well there <{> <[> so you have isolated </[> you have isolated exceptions to the rule

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#145:1:C>
<[> Common universe </[> </{> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#146:1:D>
But as a general rule the bar exam is only supposed to ask you uh to measure a minimum threshold of knowledge <{> <[> <,> </[> which you must possess in order to be qualified to serve as a lawyer
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#149:1:D>
Now there are only how many months before the bar exam 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#147:1:C>
<[> That 's the ideal </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#150:1:C>
Six months

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#151:1:D>
Six months
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#152:1:D>
It 's impossible for you to go through everything that you 've read during the four years that you uh went to law school
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#153:1:D>
But conceivably they can ask you anything about what you learned during those four years
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#154:1:D>
And if your school was not very good <,> then that review would be all that you would <{> <[> basically you have to </[> rely on

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#155:1:C>
<[> You have to rely on </[> </{> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#156:1:D>
I I I recall that <,> as you know my preparation was spotty 



<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#> I did not devote one hundred percent of my time to the study studying for the bar because I was also busy engaged in other activities like uh physical training
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#157:1:D>
So I noticed that when I was taking the exam already I knew the answer to the question not because I had read it during the the months prior <{> <[> immediately </[> uh preceding the bar exam

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#158:1:B>
<[> Immediately </[> </{> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#159:1:D>
Well I still remember what my professor told me during the four years during some obscure day when I was sitting in his classroom
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#160:1:D>
And I think that is a crucial <.> em </.> they consisted the bulk of my answers they call what they call stock knowledge <,> I 'm sure you noticed that also

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#161:1:C>
I did

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#162:1:D>
Did you

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#163:1:C>
Yes I did but <,> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#164:1:D>
Stuff that <{> <[> you did not use </[>

<[> I think the question </[> </{> well my personal opinion is <,> that the questions some some of the subjects the examiners were not able to phrase the question <{1> <[1> correctly </[1> okay <{2> <[2> accurately </[2> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#166:1:D>
<[1> Uh well </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#167:1:D>
<[2> Also true </[2> </{2> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#168:1:C>
It 's so hard to to know what is he <{> <[> asking for I don't understand </[> he 's asking

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#169:1:D>
<[> What exactly that he wants </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#170:1:D>
That is a common

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#171:1:C>
That 's the difference and I really felt because of the ambiguity in the question I was having a hard time <,> trying to <.> de </.> to figure out what he was asking for so
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#172:1:C>
I was always in because I was trained in U P I was always I would always think that he would was asking a hard question <{> <[> and he wants me to analyze </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#173:1:B>
<[> Can you ask the proctor </[> </{> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#174:1:D>
<{> <[> No you can't </[> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#175:1:C>
<[> No you can't </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#176:1:B>
You can't

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#177:1:C>
Because the proctor does not know

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#178:1:B>
Uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#179:1:C>
He does not know yeah

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#180:1:D>
Yeah

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#181:1:C>
He 's just like personnel in the Supreme Court

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#182:1:D>
He probably doesn't know the answer and he doesn't understand the question he understands it even less

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#183:1:C>
So unlike Uzoy I I really think that the bar exam is an it 's an equalizer but but of course we have an edge okay in the sense that we have been trained better because there are a lot of law schools you could see a lot of people from the provinces

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#184:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#185:1:C>
And I remember in my in my one in my room there were people who took the exams three times already and they <{> <[> were </[> comparing the paper

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-071#186:1:D>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 

 </I>
