 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#82:1:A>
Oh my God
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#83:1:A>
You know for the longest time I wasn't admitting that I had a boyfriend because I was with this guy uhm starting thirteen no when I was thirteen like that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#84:1:A>
But of course that that time it was just M U M U we call it M U <,> <&> = mutual understanding </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#85:1:A>
Do we have <O> chuckle </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#86:1:A>
So when I was finally sixteen I go okay this is the time so I said yes but I was denying it totally to my friends my family like that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#87:1:A>
And then one night we were staying in my Dad 's office right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#88:1:A>
We we we came from a party and then we were in the elevator he wanted to say good night kiss good night and then I go okay inside the elevator at that time

<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#139:1:B>
You
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#140:1:B>

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#141:1:A>
You have

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#142:1:B>
I have

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#143:1:A>
I haven't

Is it nice

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#146:1:B>
It 's ugly <,> dirty

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#147:1:A>
All
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#148:1:A>
Even <,,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#149:1:B>
No I 've been to the really

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#150:1:A>
Really nice ones

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#151:1:B>
No I go to hotels <indig> e </indig> <&> speaker A laughs </&> the really nice <,> hotels

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#153:1:A>
No I wonder if it because is it not degrading
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#154:1:A>
Honey let 's go to the motel 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#155:1:A>
Huh don't I look like a hotel <{> <[> beauty </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#156:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> that 's why I go to the hotel

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#157:1:C>
I think the problem is because like motels in in the States they are just

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#158:1:B>
Motorists

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#159:1:C>
Yeah they 're I mean they 're places where you actually go to any time
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#160:1:C>
Not embarrassing to go but in our society you know motels have have developed into something
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#161:1:C>
So one you know few hours like we have <{> <[> big billboards </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#162:1:B>
<[> Short time </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#163:1:A>
True

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#164:1:C>
Three hours

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#165:1:A>
Yeah

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#166:1:C>
And it just makes it cheaper <indig> kasi </indig> I mean a lot of married people go to motels because there 's no <{> <[> privacy </[> at home

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#167:1:B>
<[> Right </[> </{> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#168:1:C>
'Cause they have all their relatives <{> <[> living there </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#169:1:A>
<[> And it 's spice </[> </{> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#170:1:C>
And so they have to go

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#171:1:A>
Spice

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#172:1:C>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#178:1:A>
Brokenhearted <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#179:1:A>
No no you have to be a little dirty if you want spice

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#180:1:B>
Yeah my <indig> Tito </indig> told me if you want to your marriage to last you have to be the prostitute

No it 's not that I agree I mean I guess it depends on the guys also
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#190:1:C>
But it 's if you think <.> prosti </.> I mean it 's so disgusting I mean this person will just look at you as an object and he won't look at you as a person

Should the girl be stronger than the guy or the guy should have a stronger <{> <[> personality </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#236:1:A>
<[> I think </[> </{> should be equal

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#237:1:B>
Equal

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#238:1:A>
Yeah because we don't wanna be dominated as much as they don't wanna be dominated
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#239:1:A>

Yeah <{> <[> you won't find guys </[> who who like equality

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#245:1:A>
<[> You don't like equality </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#246:1:B>
Hardly

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#247:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#248:1:A>
I go you know what if in day one you made it clear that you cannot pinch me you cannot even you know <.> wh </.> what 's this <&> speaker thinks of a word that would describe an action </&> oh my God <,> do this to me
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#251:1:A>
<{> <[> What do you call it </[> </{> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#252:1:C>
<[> <indig> E </indig> </[> </{> there 's no English word for <indig> pitik </indig>

You don't <&> speaker C chuckles </&> you don't <&> speaker C chuckles </&> as long as you don't touch even the ends of my nails I don't think they will
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#257:1:A>
But if you let them yes they will
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#258:1:A>
So I was telling I forgot who
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#259:1:A>
Uh I was telling another friend I go you know remember Angelo my first boyfriend
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#260:1:A>
He was like the school bully but never in our entire <O> cough </O> relationship and that lasted ten years that he even you know pulled one strand of my hair and to think he had a really very bad temper

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#262:1:B>
Really

<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#263:1:A>
Yeah because I told him from day one you may shout at me or whatever but you can never touch me I 'll kill you <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#264:1:A>
And I think it <.> di </.> it it also depends on how you deal with the fight
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#265:1:A>
If you start shouting and cursing I guess of course they 'll retaliate but have you ever seen anyone who 's you know cursing and all that while the other girl 's <,> super quiet

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-083#266:1:C>
