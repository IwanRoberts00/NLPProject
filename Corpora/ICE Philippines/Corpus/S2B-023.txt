<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#1:1:A>
<&> Not beginning of speech </&> It is this experience which
gives our gathering and this particular day special meaning
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#2:1:A>
For today twenty-five years ago Martial Law was imposed on this
country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#3:1:A>
Many would much rather forget that dark period of our nation 's
history
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#4:1:A>
But should we ever forget we would only expose ourselves and our
children and our children 's children anew to its indignity and horror <O> 
several sentences in Filipino </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#5:1:A>
Martial law can we ever forget the megalomaniac regime which
plundered our nation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#6:1:A>
Can we ever forget the strong-arm meddling in the conduct of
business and industry the fawning of cronies and the wannabe cronies the
shameless ostentation in Malaca&ntilde;ang as the poor mired in misery
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#7:1:A>
Can we ever forget the terrifying face of our own military turned
against us as enemy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#8:1:A>
Under military rule there was no freedom of movement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#9:1:A>
Those who were critical of the regime were considered subversive
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#10:1:A>
They were arrested for preliminary investigation and released a
half year later only to be kept on constant surveillance later to be arrested
again
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#11:1:A>
The people learned to fear their own sisters brothers and friends
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#12:1:A>
They feared their own walls their own shadows their own whispered
rejection of a regime so ignominious
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#13:1:A>
Do we not remember Trinidad Herrera
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#14:1:A>
She protested against the inhumane demolition of <w> squatters'
 </w> homes in the city
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#15:1:A>
She was arrested
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#16:1:A>
She was tortured
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#17:1:A>
She was but one of the thousands broken by cigarette burns
ear-popping water treatment beating strangulation scalding mid-air suspension
sexual assault and electric shock
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#18:1:A>
Do we not remember the routine hamletting the rude zoning the
murderous salvaging
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#19:1:A>
Do we not remember Ninoy Aquino incarcerated and exiled for his
opposition to this regime
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#20:1:A>
He was killed in the tarmac that now bears his name
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#21:1:A>
He was killed by self-absolutizing power gone paranoid desperate to
preserve itself in power
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#22:1:A>
You prayed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#23:1:A>
You acted <O> several sentences in Filipino </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#24:1:A>
Together we pray in our prayer in our recollection of recent
history in our recollection of ominous events and confusing public statements
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#25:1:A>
We bishops and faithful Catholics and Protestants believers in God
and humanity discovered our common position
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#26:1:A>
We were convinced that Charter Change at this time would be immoral
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#27:1:A>
It would be self-serving and benefit primarily those who desired to
stay in power beyond constitutional limits
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#28:1:A>
It would divide the nation and distract from other pressing
national concerns
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#29:1:A>
It would expose the Constitution to total change without sufficient
time for national deliberation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#30:1:A>
Convinced of its immorality we bonded in common purpose and common
action <O> several sentences in Filipino </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#31:1:A>
We are firm in our <O> applause </O> we are firm in our common
position
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#32:1:A>
We reject an immoral change of charter at this time
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#33:1:A>
We reject any and all martial and military options to perpetuate
any politician in power
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#34:1:A>
We say <mention> yes </mention> to clean and honest elections
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#35:1:A>
<mention> Yes </mention> to the supremacy of civilian authority
over military power
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#36:1:A>
<mention> Yes </mention> to the imperative stability of
constitutional order
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#37:1:A>
For this gladly we risked our lives
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#38:1:A>
For this gladly we would lay down our lives
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#39:1:A>
We prayed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#40:1:A>
We acted in the darkness of confusing official statements and
contradictory official actions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#41:1:A>
We feared the President of the Philippines was not with us
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#42:1:A>
We feared he was sadly <unclear> 1 word </unclear> from the spirit
which bonded us at EDSA and unified us in the ratification of the nineteen
eighty-seven Constitution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#43:1:A>
We feared we have been betrayed in our trust <O> several sentences
in Filipino interspersed with applause </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#44:1:A>
The President has declared that there will be elections in nineteen
ninety-eight <O> applause </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#45:1:A>
He has declared he is not running in nineteen ninety-eight <O> 
applause </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#46:1:A>
He has directed his party mates to shelve legislative moves for a
constituent assembly <O> applause </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#47:1:A>
He has acknowledged that the people prefer a constitutional
convention after the nineteen ninety-eight elections <O> applause </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#48:1:A>
<X> For your information this statement of mine was made eight
times <&> laughter </&> because I was watching his changes of mind <&> 
laughter hooting applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#X49:1:A>
This is his last statement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#X50:1:A>
I hope he does not change any longer </X> <O> applause </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#51:1:A>
He has declared he wills to do what must be done to ensure that the
elections in nineteen ninety-eight be peaceful and honest
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#52:1:A>
Come June nineteen ninety-eight he will turn over power peacefully
to his elected successor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#53:1:A>
<X> That is why the Church is involved in this because if the
election is not clean and we touched the basic laws of our Constitution there
will be animosity in our country and the bishops would not like this to
happen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#X54:1:A>
Therefore we are trying to solve the problems of the country </X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#55:1:A>
In the meantime as our President he will provide the leadership
necessary to help this nation face the manifold problems which confront it
today
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#56:1:A>
Through our new-found unity and only through our new-found unity he
will not be a lame-duck President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#57:1:A>
In thanksgiving we now pray for national reconciliation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#58:1:A>
If in the heat of our passionate love for our country and for our
democracy words have been exchanged which have caused undue personal hurt we
humbly ask the Lord and each affected person including the President for
forgiveness <O> applause </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#59:1:A>
We have not campaigned in hate and have not wished to demonize any
person
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#60:1:A>
But we have acted with burning concern for our freedom convinced
that the enemy of humanity the enemy of truth and right is wont to tempt
mislead delude and possess fellow human beings into his ends in profound
injury of our humanity
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#61:1:A>
It is this enemy we have renounced and shall continue to denounce
in our sacred duty as pastor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#62:1:A>
Let us pray first for our President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#63:1:A>
<X> I am praying for him almost every day I do not even pray for my
mother </X> <&> laughter </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#64:1:A>
Let us pray for him sincerely that he as President now feel our
respect our love and gratitude for all he has done well for our nation as
President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#65:1:A>
We pray that as he now addresses the urgent problems of our
suddenly downward economy restores the confidence of our people and friends
in our political stability and economic vigor tackles the challenge of the
forthcoming <foreign> El Ni&ntilde;o </foreign> leads us towards clean and
honest elections and continues to address the alleviation of poverty that he
experience behind him the united strength and energy of the Filipino people
 <O> several sentences in Filipino interspersed with applause </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#66:1:A>
We pray my sisters and brothers for each other that we all be
helped to exercise power as Christ did
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#67:1:A>
The night before he died got up from table removed his garments and
taking a towel wrapped it around his waist then he poured water into a basin
and began to wash the <w> disciples' </w> feet
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#68:1:A>
That was Christ 's power
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#69:1:A>
Let us pray for humility in our service strength in our weakness
endurance in our vigilance against all that might harm our country and unity
in the shared task we have ahead of us
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#70:1:A>
As we have today been willing to risk our lives for freedom and
democracy should the common good demand us to sacrifice more of our time our
treasure our personal energy or even our lives to preserve the just order and
serve the common good we pray and pray intensely that we not be found wanting ...

Your Excellency Vice-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo Mrs Corazon
Aquino former President Fidel Ramos the members of the clergy the religious
sisters the honorable government officials the ever vigilant people 's
organizations <.> lab </.> labor leaders my dear brothers and sisters in
Christ
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#72:2:A>
Let me begin by expressing my personal gratitude for the
recognition given to the Filipino people as one of the five freedom awardees
of the EDSA People Power Commission
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#73:2:A>
Former President Ramos Congressman Butz Aquino and I received the
award on behalf of the Filipino people <mention> on behalf </mention> how
beautiful is that phrase
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#74:2:A>
My life has always been lived on behalf of
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#75:2:A>
I am only here on behalf of the flock entrusted to me by the Good
Shepherd Jesus Christ
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#76:2:A>
I am only here on behalf of you my beloved countrymen because I am
your brother and shepherd
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#77:2:A>
Today I renew my pledge to pray on your behalf so that you and your
children 's children may continue to enjoy the blessings we gained in
nineteen eighty-six
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#78:2:A>
We have all grown in age since nineteen eighty-six
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#79:2:A>
Some have lost hair or some teeth
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#80:2:A>
My knees and my voice are no longer as strong fourteen years ago
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#81:2:A>
Even if my knees and voice fail I promise never to fail you in
fighting for freedom and speaking for justice and truth
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#82:2:A>
I 'll be your pastor fighting for freedom to the <.> en </.> last
breath of my life up to the last drop of my blood up to the last <?> twinge
 </?> of energy in my body <O> applause </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#83:2:A>
Our strength is from the Lord
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#84:2:A>
Christ is our peace
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#85:2:A>
Remembering EDSA in the year of Jubilee that is what we are asked
to do here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#86:2:A>
This afternoon fourteen years have gone by since the hundreds of
thousands filled the streets around us
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#87:2:A>
How quickly time has gone by
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#88:2:A>
How do we remember EDSA this year
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#89:2:A>
Let us and let me reflect on the year of Jubilee and draw a few
lines from it into our present moment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#90:2:A>
The Book of Leviticus has described a full Jubilee Year in these
terms <quote> during this year of the Lord 's favor all fields lie fallow
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#91:2:A>
<X> Family members have the right to freedom to freedom family land
to redeem family land that had been sold when the family was in dire need
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#X92:2:A>
All debts are remitted
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#X93:2:A>
All slaves are set free </X> </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#94:2:A>
The Jubilee Year calls for a redirection of priorities in favor of
the poor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#95:2:A>
Christian churches and other Bible-based groups have drawn up the
agenda for this year summarized for us in the five Rs
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#96:2:A>
Return of the land and other means of production to their original
or rightful owners
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#97:2:A>
Recall of debts unjustly imposed on the poor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#98:2:A>
The release of prisoners those of course who no longer pose a
genuine threat to society
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#99:2:A>
Release too of all those in contemporary <.> sla </.> slave-like
conditions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#100:2:A>
Rest for the earth and conservation of the natural environment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#101:2:A>
And the restoration of harmony among women and men best in their
 <.> rep </.> respective roles rights and equal dignity
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#102:2:A>
As Pope John Paul the second has told us the overall meaning of
the Jubilee Year was to call on the entire community to bring back the
original harmony which God gave to his creation a harmony which human
sinfulness human greed human blindness had damaged
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#103:2:A>
The Jubilee Year reminds us that we are merely stewards of God 's
planning
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#104:2:A>
The one world the one single haven we share is not ours it is a
gift of God 's love
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#105:2:A>
So during the Jubilee Year we must lift the burdens we have placed
on the backs of the poor the oppressed the excluded the weakest and most
powerf powerless members of society
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#106:2:A>
The Jubilee Year is meant to be a year of fostering hope so that
everyone can share the hope of a new beginning of harmony within humanity and
with all of creation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#107:2:A>
A new hope that the grand design of God is still possible of
fulfillment within history
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#108:2:A>
EDSA nineteen eighty-six was in fact a Jubilee experience
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#109:2:A>
It was a freeing of a nation long shackled by the ruinous
dictatorship
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#110:2:A>
It was setting the downtrodden free
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#111:2:A>
It was giving broken ones new hope the blind new sight
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#112:2:A>
It was resurrection for the poor who had been abused tortured
salvaged raped plundered slain
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#113:2:A>
It was truly good news to the poor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#114:2:A>
It was God answering our prayers our pleas our cries and our tears
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#115:2:A>
No one who was here for the jubilation of the night of February
twenty-fifth will ever forget the Lord has restored our land to us as He had
promised
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#116:2:A>
We need that experience of Jubilee again
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#117:2:A>
EDSA should not be reduced to an event in history when a people
toppled a dictator
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#118:2:A>
It is rather a story of one entire nation winning the pursuit of
peace through peaceful means
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#119:2:A>
EDSA gave us hope
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#120:2:A>
Unfortunately when we the so-called heroes of EDSA were already in
power we we sort of enjoyed the power and played blind to the abuses of the
post-EDSA years
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#121:2:A>
EDSA changed the personalities in nineteen eighty-six but this
corrupt system did not change
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#122:2:A>
When the victims of the dictatorship took on positions of power in
government we started to keep quiet in the face of abuses because we were now
the beneficiaries of the political favors
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#123:2:A>
The poor of nineteen eighty-six are still poor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#124:2:A>
<indig> Natapos na kayo kami naman </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#125:2:A>
It makes us and it makes me very sad to say this but humbly we
accept that it is true
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#126:2:A>
EDSA is about change but not simply a change of persons but a
change within each person so that society can change
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#127:2:A>
We do not want remembering EDSA this year to be an empty ceremony
just show and speak
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#128:2:A>
The Jubilee Year reminds us that God 's plan for human society
calls for us to try to construct here in our country some true anticipation
of the world of freedom and justice solidarity and peace which is God 's
kingdom for us
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#129:2:A>
At bottom that is what EDSA was about that is what EDSA must be
about now
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#130:2:A>
To us all Jesus addresses His mission statement to bring good news
to the poor in an extraordinary way in this year of Jubilee
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#131:2:A>
Our present government was elected on the strength of that promise
it would work for the poor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#132:2:A>
Let the resolve we bring home thus this EDSA assembly this year of
Jubilee be that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#133:2:A>
It will be a year when our priority above all else will be to
bring good news to the poor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#134:2:A>
The preferential option for the poor in our land must be the first
of imperatives for all in this Jubilee Year so that this year will truly be
the year of the Lord 's favor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#135:2:A>
This is our resolve as we gather here in EDSA two thousand
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#136:2:A>
This is our task as we go back to work to bring the spirit of EDSA
to life and <?> live </?> once more
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#137:2:A>
It is a task for everyone
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#138:2:A>
This is what the Jubilee Year demands of us all
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#139:2:A>
God is with us
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#140:2:A>
Let us go forward with him
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#141:2:A>
Amen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#142:2:A>
God bless you all
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-023#143:2:A>
<indig> Salamat po </indig> </I>
