<O> music </O> Oscar Orbos the wonder boy of Philippine politics is now out of office
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#2:1:A>
From a congressman of Pangasinan to Secretary of the Department of Transportation and Communications to the position of Executive Secretary or Little President his rise to the top has been phenomenal
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#3:1:A>
But today he is out of office an ordinary citizen a practicing lawyer <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#4:1:A>
His resignation came on the heels of widespread reports that he had a shouting match with Finance Secretary Jesus Estanislao on the issues of oil price reduction and a cut in the import levy and his ambitions to run for President in nineteen ninety-two <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#5:1:A>
But he dispelled the rumor that he had presidential ambitions or be a senatorial candidate
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#6:1:A>
But reports have it that he is being approached by several presidential timbers like Governor Lito Osme&ntilde;a of Cebu former Secretary Fidel Ramos and Miriam Defensor-Santiago to be their running mate in nineteen ninety-two
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#7:1:A>
The sudden resignation of Oscar Orbos from the position of Executive Secretary underscored a <unclear> word </unclear> characteristic of the Aquino administration
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#8:1:A>
In its fold political life tends to be nasty brute and temporary
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#9:1:A>
His resignation is probably the political equivalent of the Mount Pinatubo eruption
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#10:1:A>
The break was unexpected and it came at a time when the presidency was vulnerable and still is struggling from a natural calamity the stock market plunged and the political outlook bleak
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#11:1:A>
After hibernating from public view for almost two weeks Oscar Orbos comes out into the open and says his piece on the controversy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#12:1:A>
Tonight AttyRic Puno looks into the plans and agenda of the <foreign> wunderkind </foreign> of Philippine politics in his exclusive one on one interview
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#13:1:A>
For <mention> Viewpoint </mention> this is Rico Hizon reporting <O> music </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#14:1:B>
Good evening friends and uh welcome once again to <mention> Viewpoint </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#15:1:B>
Well uh as you know by now our only guest for this evening 's presentation is now Atty former Executive Secretary Oscar M Orbos
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#16:1:B>
Now as you also know uh sometime last week uh on my colleague Louie Beltran 's show our guest appeared and a lot of people were saying that maybe he was a little bit too secretive too mild and maybe did not really address some of the issues that were presented there
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#17:1:B>
But if you will notice in the last couple of days an article has appeared in a number of newspapers where our guest today made some rather strong and very interesting criticisms against the handling of the economic policy of this country
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#18:1:B>
Let me start with his conclusion which is going to start uh which is going to form the basis of our discussion this evening
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#19:1:B>
What he said <quote> What we need is a new stabilization program based not on ad hoc and ill-conceived measures but on sound economic principles that is consistent with our people 's modest needs and not simply those of our financial creditors and that builds on a social consensus for reforms rather than tearing apart the fabric the fabric of democratic society 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#20:1:B>
<X> We need such a program today </X> </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#21:1:B>
Tonight we are going to ask our guest about the details of this particular article and his views which may give us a clue as to what really happened in terms of that very very fabled and uh talked about resignation recently
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#22:1:B>
We will be right back after this <O> music </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#23:1:B>
Okay welcome back to uh <mention> Viewpoint </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#24:1:B>
Well uh how shall I call you uh Atty <indig> Pa&ntilde;ero </indig> Oscar Orbos uh former Executive Secretary Oca <O> laughter </O> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#25:1:C>
Yeah Dong just plain Oca I guess uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#26:1:A>
Okay well Oca you know uh <,> I know there has been a lot of commentary on your previous appearance on uh my good friend Louie Beltran 's <mention> Straight from the Shoulder </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#27:1:A>
And uh you made it a point not to be drawn into a war of personalities or of trying to uh make certain characterizations on personal motives
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#28:1:A>
Now I 'd like to respect that but at the same time I think as we 've discussed earlier we 'd like to talk more about the process and the matter of policy consideration
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#29:1:A>
Because that 's what 's important about this particular issue
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#30:1:A>
We leave to another day the question of uh even the matter of presidential ambitions and all that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#31:1:A>
But on the other hand what I find somewhat interesting is the conclusion that you made in this series of articles that you 've written recently
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#32:1:A>
And I 'd like to talk about that because it has everything to do with economic policy and how it affects the people particularly those that are less uh less privileged in life <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#33:1:A>
But uh before that Oca let me ask you about this dichotomy this difference that people are making between what is popular and allegedly what is right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#34:1:A>
I mean even the President made a big uh made a lot of reference to this in her State of the Nation address
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#35:1:A>
It appears now that there is a contrast between at least insofar as people in government are concerned between what has to be popular or what what is popular and what has to be done which just seems to be right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#36:1:A>
So how do you view this
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#37:1:A>
Is something that 's popular not necessarily right or vice versa

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#38:1:C>
Well uh Dong uh in this case I can say that uh <,> accidentally what is popular is right

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#39:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#40:1:C>
And it is not necessarily the case that uh what is not uh <.> u </.> unpopular uh is right

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#41:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#42:1:C>
Uh I think uh the fundamental issue is here is uh the interest of the country

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#43:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#44:1:C>
It 's not who is right and who is wrong uh academically speaking
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#45:1:C>
But uh we have to be sensitive as to the needs of the people and what the economy would need at uh at a given moment
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#46:1:C>
You know the economy Dong as far as I can see it is a living thing
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#47:1:C>
You know you you have to respond immediately

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#48:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#49:1:C>
I mean there are things that uh you cannot delay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#50:1:C>
Now uh in this particular case well the issue on the oil price and on the levy is uh very symptomatic of uh on certain differences uh on the overall policy

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#51:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#52:1:C>
Uh in this case in our economic stabilization program

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#53:1:B>
Okay now <,> the uh what has happened thus far as we talked the uh I N C demonstration yesterday the date of the State of the Nation address has been aborted <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#54:1:B>
It was preempted in a way
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#55:1:B>
So really what happened yesterday was it was not with some exceptions not a very very uh you know difficult day in terms of the uh in terms of the demonstrations that could have would could have occurred
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#56:1:B>
But this represented in the minds of many people a reversal of government policy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#57:1:B>
In the beginning people thought that government was dead set against and you were still there okay people thought that government was dead set against any kind of reduction in the in the oil price in oil oil prices
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#58:1:B>
Then because of the threat government came back and said we 're going to reduce after all 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#59:1:B>
And then later on when you come back in your article you say that the price reduction should have been more
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#60:1:B>
It should have been one peso and eighty-two <{1> <[1> centavos </[1> rather than the <{2> <[2> average of one peso </[2> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#61:1:C>
<[1> And </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#62:1:C>
<[2> And Dong </[2> </{2> it should have been earlier

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#63:1:B>
It should have been earlier

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#64:1:C>
What I 'm saying is that our economic managers shouldn't have should have not brought uh this country to the brink

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#65:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#66:1:C>
I remember as early as uh four months ago when you know in our monitoring uh of some of the indicators in the economy we were suggesting already a cutback uh on the oil prices and a cutback on the levy

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#67:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#68:1:C>
This is uh a necessary measure we thought <,> uh in order to calibrate the easing up already after a constrictive uh period

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#69:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#70:1:C>
And it was very important Dong because uh by then we thought that the economy has been squeech squeezed uh too much already

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#71:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#72:1:C>
And that uh this was unnecessary

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#73:1:B>
<.> Le </.> let 's take it step by step
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#74:1:B>
In the beginning is it true that there was a real conflict of opinion between those that were saying precisely what you 're saying that the time had come when perhaps a rollback a reduction in price was appropriate and those that said that under no circumstances would there be a reduction until the O P S F uh deficit was completely wiped out and a surplus and a buffer so-called was achieved
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#75:1:B>
Was there such a conflict

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#76:1:C>
Yes uh as to the timing uh Dong uh our sense then as early as uh four months ago is that the economy could uh actually tolerate uh a little easing up after a constrictive uh period

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#77:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#78:1:C>
And that uh well one of the measures would be to cut back on the levy so that uh cost would go down and already maybe addressing uh the oil price

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#79:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#80:1:C>
Because even then we were anticipating that by August uh the deficit would zero out and that uh we could afford already a cutback uh a reduction uh in the price

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#81:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#82:1:C>
And that we did not have to wait for August to do this
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#83:1:C>
Uh well in effect uh what we wanted to advocate was instead of asking the people to be patient we would be asking the oil companies to be a little patient because they would be paid anyway

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#84:1:B>
In other words rather than having the O P S F subsidy zero out in August they would have to wait until a few more months later

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#85:1:C>
Yes

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#86:1:B>
In September

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#87:1:C>
This was uh a proposal
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#88:1:C>
Of course we went through a number of proposals because we are a team

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#89:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#90:1:C>
And we work uh within uh certain uh parameters
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#91:1:C>
But uh the more fundamental issue here if I may say so Dong is that uh the targets uh we have committed ourselves to the I M F at two point five percent uh deficit uh to G N P ratio

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#92:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#93:1:C>
Was too constrictive

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#94:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#95:1:C>
And that in fact under the Krugman Report we could be a little more liberal maybe bring it up to five percent

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#96:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#97:1:C>
And that all of this uh what mindset about meeting targets uh to me <.> i </.> uh is really uh well a serious crime because uh we would be killing the economy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#98:1:C>
While it 's true we could talk about long term you don't have to kill the short term for the long term

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#99:1:B>
So what you 're saying is that the concern about maintaining certain targets uh maintaining deficits within certain guidelines number one was also resulting in a lot of other difficulties for the economy itself

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#100:1:C>
Oh yes uh Dong uh in fact uh many of my colleagues in the cabinet uh have been heard uh to complain about uh lack of money lack of funds for schools for bridges uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#101:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#102:1:C>
To deliver services we had to lay off people
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#103:1:C>
Up to a certain point uh there was a need to belt-tighten

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#104:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#105:1:C>
But beyond that if we have to constrict some more uh my position was that well it 's going to kill the economy

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#106:1:B>
What about the argument that these uh restrictions these guidelines had to be met because otherwise we would not uh comply with the stabilization program which we had agreed to under a Letter of Intent in which in turn would lead to problems regarding new money for the Philippines

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#107:1:C>
But you know Dong uh that 's precisely the debate
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#108:1:C>
You could rework the program uh with these creditors and justify it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#109:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#110:1:C>
There 's nothing sacrosanct about numbers committed to the IM F

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#111:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#112:1:C>
We have to be sensitive
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#113:1:C>
We have to attend to the welfare of our people and it 's for us to explain to them that in fact the economy could uh afford a little more uh liberal uh movement towards spending more

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#114:1:B>
<.> Le </.> let 's let 's analyze a little bit of that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#115:1:B>
When you say you could spend a little more that it was too constrictive
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#116:1:B>
Give us some details to that

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#117:1:C>
<{> <[> For instance </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#118:1:B>
<[> To what extent </[> </{> was it constrictive

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#119:1:C>
For instance Dong uh if we maintain the same targets now <,> we would be foregoing the use of about twenty-eight billion pesos

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#120:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#121:1:C>
In foreign-assisted projects

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#122:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#123:1:C>
Uh because uh we would not release the counterpart funds because by releasing these counterpart funds we would be going over the deficit targets

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#124:1:B>
You mean twenty-eight billion pesos could have been devoted to more projects in this economy right now

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#125:1:C>
Yes

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#126:1:B>
Uh-huh

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#127:1:C>
And that means uh lesser opportunities lesser employment lesser activities <foreign> etcetera </foreign> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#128:1:B>
Twenty-eight billion could take the form of what for example infrastructure projects

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#129:1:C>
Infrastructure
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#130:1:C>
Uh there could be some other livelihood programs uh environmental uh uh promotion <foreign> etcetera </foreign> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#131:1:B>
So so in other words you were not convinced or at least when you were arguing for this position uh you were not convinced that these deficit maintenance targets uh were necessary in order to convince the creditors and maybe even the I M F that we were still still well within our ability to be able to pay back all of those obligations later on

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#132:1:C>
Exactly Dong

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#133:1:B>
Uh-huh okay

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#134:1:C>
Uh those are the premises
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#135:1:C>
And besides at that point uh it has to be a calibrated measure

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#136:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-044#137:1:C>
You know I was saying all along that uh if we keep on with these targets uh and we insist on the nine percent levy and we insist on the on the <unclear> word </unclear> percent uh uh price structure of of oil and gasoline products what will happen is that in in fact we will have inflation we will have unemployment and uh the reasons for all of these uh why they were put in place <,> revenues <,> is not happening 

 </I>
