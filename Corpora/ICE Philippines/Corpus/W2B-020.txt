<h> <bold> The ludicrousness of our electoral laws </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#2:1>
<bold> By MANUEL F. ALMARIO </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#3:1>
<bold> There </bold> are good laws and bad laws.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#4:1>
Good laws are those that promote justice, foster progress and enhance
liberty.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#5:1>
Bad laws are those that are oppressive, unjust and which curtail human
rights. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#6:1>
A bad law is also one that is unenforceable because it is
impractical, even ridiculous, and not fully sanctioned by public opinion.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#7:1>
In such a case, a bad law is more honored in the breach than in the
observance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#8:1>
Among the bad laws in Philippine experience was the one during
martial law which penalized by fine or imprisonment failure to vote in
elections.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#9:1>
This was never enforced, at least not seriously, because during
elections thousands, perhaps millions, of Filipinos don't vote.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#10:1>
Our jails would not be enough to hold all those who fail to vote
either intentionally or for lack of interest.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#11:1>
Besides, the refusal to vote is as much a right as the act of voting.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#12:1>
In the 1981 presidential elections, which was boycotted by many
voters, the Marcos regime tried to make an example of several individuals by
filing charges against them for violation of the election law penalizing
non-voting.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#13:1>
As far as we recall, these suits were not pursued to their final
conclusion. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#14:1>
Another bad edict was Marcos 's order for a curfew on the last
day of the EDSA revolution when he had no more power.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#15:1>
The people laughed themselves to near death in the streets and at the
barricades. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#16:1>
In the United States, one notoriously bad law was the <mention>
Prohibition Law </mention> which prohibited the sale and drinking of
alcoholic beverages.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#17:1>
The law, passed by the U.S. Congress under pressure of religious and
moralistic groups, was rejected by the public in general so that it readily
spawned a huge underground business in smuggling and gangsterism.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#18:1>
The law later on had to be repealed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#19:1>
So mere good intentions do not necessarily make good law.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#20:1>
As the saying goes, <quote> the road to hell is paved with good
intentions. </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#21:1>
<bold> Sadly </bold> , we have in our statute books an election
code which is full of silly regulations that cannot be enforced simply
because they are impractical or not fully supported by public opinion. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#22:1>
One such regulation is that which limit campaigning to 90 days
for national candidates and to 45 days for local candidates.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#23:1>
Ostensibly, the purpose of such regulation is to limit the expenses
of candidates, thus placing them, both rich and poor alike, on an equal
basis. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#24:1>
But of course this is not really followed.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#25:1>
Politicians campaign all the time, whether there is a formal campaign
period or not. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#26:1>
Politicians who are successfully elected to public office
campaign for their reelection immediately after taking their oath of office.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#27:1>
The defeated candidates, on the other hand, start making plans and
taking moves for the next election right after the results of the last
election are known. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#28:1>
Some people may say this makes for too much politics.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#29:1>
But politics is the lifeblood of democracy, and the lifeblood must
keep on running otherwise the body politic, which is the state, would die.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#30:1>
Besides the ban against &ldquo; campaigning &rdquo; outside of a
formal electoral period is, in essence, a curtailment of the freedom of
speech and the freedom of assembly.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#31:1>
Since it limits the exercise of liberty, it is a bad law. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#32:1>
Because politics is the art or science of government, and
government is a continuing affair, then necessarily politics is a constant
activity, especially because governmental power must permanently be
confronted by a militant opposition to prevent its abuse.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#33:1>
It is when an opposition becomes lax or cowardly that abuse of power
in a democracy becomes possible, as in the time when President Marcos
declared martial law, and the political opposition, with few exceptions,
failed to courageously and vigorously oppose it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#34:1>
<bold> Then </bold> there is the provision prohibiting the
pasting or display of political posters during an election period except in
places designated by the Commission on Elections.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#35:1>
Now this is indeed laughable.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#36:1>
It is so ridiculous that most, if not all candidates, violate it, and
the public do not mind. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#37:1>
Why should the public mind, when what they are interested in is
knowing first of all who are running and on what issues so that they could
make their choice wisely?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#38:1>
You don't expect a citizen to skip work or school, or to sacrifice
his leisure, just to make a beeline to some obscure site designated by the
Comelec just to gaze at the faces of the candidates and peruse their inane
propaganda.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#39:1>
How much more convenient it would be for them just to look through
the window of their public conveyances or glance at their neighborhood 's
fences just to know who is running for office and why. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#40:1>
And then of course there is the ban against political
advertisements.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#41:1>
To the <foreign> cognoscente </foreign> , there are so many ways
getting around this rule.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#42:1>
It is the novice who is adversely affected.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#43:1>
The incumbent official who knows his media relations can get
year-round publicity without ever spending from his own pocket.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#44:1>
But the new politician, who may have some good and better ideas of
how to run a government more effectively, is hide-bound to get his ideas
across. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#45:1>
All these restrictions on election activities, which are in
reality restrictions on freedom of information, have been imposed under the
guise of making elections more equal and less costly.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#46:1>
But as we have observed, the restrictions only benefit the incumbent
and the already established politicians, and penalize the emerging and
perhaps more idealistic <foreign> politicos </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#47:1>
As for their curtailing electoral costs, there is already a provision
limiting electoral expenses to not more than the salary for one year of the
office which the candidate seeks to fill. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#48:1>
It is significant that so far not one candidate has been found
guilty of overspending under the present electoral code.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#49:1>
On the other hand, just before the 1969 elections, a number of
senators were found guilty of overspending at a time when the laws were less
restrictive.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#50:1>
Then there was no limitation of the campaign period, nor no
restrictions in the display of posters and streamers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#51:1>
<bold> The </bold> framers of the present Omnibus Election Code
may have been motivated by good intentions.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#52:1>
In truth, they are only implementing the present Constitution, framed
by a coterie of unelected commissioners, which requires the Comelec to
<quote> &ldquo; recommend to Congress effective measures to minimize election
expenses, including limitation of places where propaganda materials shall be
posted. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#53:1>
Indeed, in this instance, it is the Constitution that mandates
unenforceable laws, tying the hands of future generations in deciding on how
best to conduct democratic elections. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#54:1>
Like the provision limiting the number of terms of office of
elective officials, such provisions limit rather than enhance the democratic
exercise.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#55:1>
Surely, it is the electorate in every given election who must
determine whom to elect regardless of how many terms of office a candidate
may have served, depending on their judgment as to how that candidate had
performed while in office. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#56:1>
Before this restriction, Philippine democracy was not any worse
than it is today.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#57:1>
In fact, the Executive and Legislature at that time had better
officials than now despite their having served multiple terms of office.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#58:1>
For example, Recto, Roxas, Laurel, Osme&ntilde;a, etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#59:1>
It is time we review our Constitution and laws regarding
elections in order to avoid our laws being ignored because of
impracticability or ridiculousness.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#60:1>
Perhaps this is the reason why our electoral processes are converted
into a circus as in the case of the hearing of the Comelec for the
qualification of candidates. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> COUNTING HEADS </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#62:2>
<bold> By Anne Stephanie Cruz </bold>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#63:2>
With Roberto Cruz

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#64:2>
ON August 19, the government will release the preliminary results
of Census 2000.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#65:2>
Note that word - <mention> &ldquo; preliminary. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#66:2>
And don't expect final results.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#67:2>
There will be none, unless the government goes to the courts to force
those who refuse to cooperate to allow themselves to be counted.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#68:2>
And end the fighting in Central Mindanao and Sulu one way or another,
to enable the refugees - even the Muslim separatist rebels and the Abu Sayyaf
bandits - - to return to their homes and be counted. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#69:2>
<h> <bold> Not new. </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#70:2>
The census is for enumeration of the population - including
foreigners living here - and evaluation of housing throughout the country,
the National Statistics Office said.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#71:2>
Just that.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#72:2>
And it is not new.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#73:2>
In fact, a census is taken every 10 years and two have been taken
since 1980, when the Census Law was passed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#74:2>
It is not dangerous to anybody 's health.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#75:2>
All that the enumerators ask people is their name, age, sex, civil
status, education, religion, occupation, number of children and personal
information on those children, and whether they rent or own their house. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#76:2>
Vilma Malumay, chief of the Databank and Information Service of
the National Statistics Office, said the enumeration covers all types of
dwelling, even push carts, caves, trailers and abandoned railroad coaches
used as houses.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#77:2>
These are counted and described to help government housing agencies
determine how many more houses are needed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#78:2>
But too many people simply do not understand the purpose of the
census.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#79:2>
In the slums the schoolteachers who have been hired to serve as
enumerators are turned away, or residents refuse to answer questions in the
belief that the information will be used to evict them.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#80:2>
In aff1uent communities in Makati, Quezon City, Mandaluyong and New
Manila, many residents pleading privacy refuse to open their doors to
enumerators.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#81:2>
Hostile ones scold enumerators or set their dogs loose on them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#82:2>
Despite Teresita Ang-See 's assurance in the TV promotion for the
census, Chinese remain fearful that information from the enumeration will be
used against them.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#83:2>
At Chinese homes, security guards, peering through peepholes on tall
steel gates, refuse to accept census forms and tell enumerators to go away.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#84:2>
Well, the government cannot blame the Chinese.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#85:2>
If they are scared, or even just suspicious, it is because of their
bad experience with the two previous governments, but especially the last,
the administration of President Fidel Ramos.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#86:2>
Toward the end of the Aquino administration, kidnapping, with rich
Chinese as targets, became a multimillion-peso industry operated by rogue
policemen and soldiers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#87:2>
The Ramos administration created an agency to battle kidnappers, but
military-types took to shaking down Chinese businessmen, which was just as
bad as kidnapping them for ransom.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#88:2>
Now who knows if the enumerators are really schoolteachers working
for the National Statistics Office or agents of the kidnappers casing the
homes of rich Chinese? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#89:2>
Administrator Tomas Africa of the National Statistics Office has
ordered enumerators experiencing resistance to file reports so that charges
can be brought against those refusing to cooperate.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#90:2>
Under the law, those who refuse to give information to the
enumeration can be fined up to &peso;500 or jailed for three months, or both
fined and jailed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#91:2>
Africa said the rich may have less need of government, but
certain concerns of less fortunate people, like traffic management service
and police and fire protection, still affect them.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#92:2>
Without them getting counted, road capacities could be
underestimated, resulting in the opening of roads in their closed communities
to the public.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#93:2>
And municipal governments could underestimate needs in purchasing
firefighting equipment, which could result in the roasting of snubs who live
in high-rise apartment buildings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#94:2>
As for the Chinese, their fear of kidnappers is understandable,
but not their fear of the Bureau of Internal Revenue - - even if the
enumeration is not intended for use by the taxman.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#95:2>
Either they answer the call to census or they go to jail. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#96:2>
The census, which began on May 1 and should cover 15.3 million
homes in the 42,000 villages of the country, has been disrupted by inclement
weather from May 12 to 18.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#97:2>
It has been extended to the end of the month to make up for lost
time.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#98:2>
Enumerators, paid &peso;22 without food and transportation allowance
- - to interview 25 families a day for 20 days, return this week to the
villages to resume the count.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#99:2>
They will return to the recalcitrant rich, including the hermetic
Chinese, to try to complete their assignments. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#100:2>
That the census cannot be completed in war-torn Central Mindanao
and bandit-infested Sulu is almost certain.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#101:2>
Enumerators have been working in refugee centers, but not all people
displaced by the fighting between the military and the separatist <indig>
Moro </indig> Islamic Liberation front in Central Mindanao or the military
operation against Abu Sayyaf bandits on Basilan and Jolo are in the refugee
centers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#102:2>
Many have fled to the forests, sneaking back into their villages at
night for a quick look at their homes, then return to their hiding places in
the woods - - where they are beyond the reach of enumerators. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#103:2>
The &ldquo; preliminary &rdquo; results of the census will not
include them.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#104:2>
Unless a special census for Central Mindanao and Sulu is taken after
the war and after the Abu Sayyaf has been obliterated, they will not be
included in the final results. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#105:2>
Could the recalcitrant rich and the cowardly Chinese be scared
into having themselves counted?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#106:2>
To be sure not.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#107:2>
Have you heard of anybody being sued by the government for not
cooperating in a census?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-020#108:2>
Like the previous two censuses, Census 2000 will not enumerate all
Filipinos. </p> </I>
