<I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#1:1:A>
Good morning Lulu
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#2:1:A>
Good morning <.> Li </.> uh Lito
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#3:1:A>
How are you today

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#4:1:B>
Well I 'm fine thank you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#6:1:B>
But the rains are quite bad

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#7:1:A>
Uh did you experience any traffic problems on the way to the office

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#8:1:B>
Apparently there are less people traveling now because of the weather

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#9:1:A>
Uh I heard in the news that uh this morning the elementary and high school uh students uh are are excused to go to the school right now <,> but in certain areas I think only
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#11:1:A>
Not not in the entire uh N C R <&> = National Capital Region </&> but in certain areas like Manila Malabon Navotas Marikina
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#12:1:A>
But I think in Para&ntilde;aque there is still school

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#13:1:B>
Quezon City also has school

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#14:1:A>
Well last night the weather the the rain was so hard and uh it caused a lot of flood
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#15:1:A>
Our street was flooded again

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#16:1:B>
I think this is basically because of the typhoon that got stuck in uh the Balintang Channel
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#17:1:B>
It hasn't moved and it has been uh triggering the monsoon in Manila even though we are not covered by typhoon signal number one

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#18:1:A>
But this weather disturbance uh uh is quite quite uh much better compared to last year <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#19:1:A>
I think last year we experienced much much worse uh uh rainfall <indig> 'no </indig> when we had a lot of big floods 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#21:1:B>
But I think this one is also a major disaster because so many towns in Bulacan are under water up to now
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#22:1:B>
And many believe that the water will stay there for some time
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#23:1:B>
It has not receded

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#24:1:A>
Well in uh Pampanga also I think there is again uh a report about a problem on road road uh uh <.> prob </.> uh you know the the water is uh the bridges are you know are almost <{> <[> being </[> overflowed overflowed uh

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#25:1:C>
<[> All the roads are flooded </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#26:1:B>
Washed away

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#27:1:A>
Yeah

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#28:1:C>
<foreign> Lahar </foreign> has been washed away again <,,> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#29:1:A>
Any problems on your uh

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#30:1:C>
What about your farm Lits
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#31:1:C>
It 's under water

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#32:1:A>
<O> laughter </O> Well uh in Zambales I think it 's a high high area
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#34:1:A>
Do you do we experience uh flooding in that area

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#35:1:B>
Well my area is in the mountains so there 's no flooding
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#36:1:B>
But uh if the rains continue the <.> la </.> you know the land becomes very soaked in water and we could say it 's water-logged
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#37:1:B>
And some of the <,> it 's not stable anymore
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#38:1:B>
Some of the loose soil uh slide down in the slope

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#39:1:C>
Too much water will destroy your crops

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#40:1:A>
You mean to say that there are a lot of cut trees also in your area

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#41:1:B>
No actually we are planting trees
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#42:1:B>
We are allocating one hectare just for the forest
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#43:1:B>
We are reforesting the place and uh it will be a very it will be high density
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#44:1:B>
Uh we are putting hardwood trees in that uh particular hectare

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#45:1:A>
But uh is it difficult to reach your area when it 's uh rainy season or

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#46:1:B>
Well there 's a road
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#47:1:B>
You can reach the area but it 's difficult to walk in the farm because of the
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#48:1:B>
It 's a slope so you could slide

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#49:1:A>
But the problem is uh you have to pass Pampanga in order to reach <{> <[> <,> </[> Zambales 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#50:1:B>
<[> Uh </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#52:1:B>
We go via Pangasinan

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#53:1:A>
Pangasinan
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#54:1:A>
But it 's a long way <indig> e </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#55:1:B>
Uh you add one and a half hours to the trip

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#56:1:C>
Just to reach your place

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#57:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#58:1:A>
But uh during this time I don't think the fruits uh prices are down because of uh of this weather

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#59:1:B>
Many crops will be damaged so I assume uh you have to pay a high price for your vegetables

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#60:1:A>
I think even fishponds uh have problems right now

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#61:1:C>
Overflowing

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#62:1:A>
<.> Overf </.> yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#63:1:B>
So many many of the neighbors will be very happy because they can get fish for free <indig> ha </indig> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#64:1:C>
Uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#65:1:A>
Did you see uh Mr the the President uh looking at the uh Manila Bay area
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#66:1:A>
<{> <[> There is </[> so much garbage <indig> ha </indig> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#67:1:C>
<[> Yeah yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#68:1:C>
Yeah that 's right

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#69:1:B>
Well uh a year ago they had this advertisement saying that if you throw your garbage it 's gonna come back <{> <[> to you </[> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#70:1:C>
<[> Come back </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#71:1:C>
It will come back to you

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#72:1:B>
So today uh <{> <[> <,> </[> that has become a reality and the garbage has come back to us 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#73:1:C>
<[> It 's gonna come back to you </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#75:1:A>
I didn't know that uh some of the uh garbage guys are disposing their garbage in the sea <indig> ha </indig> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#76:1:C>
People along the squatter area they just dispose their garbage

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#77:1:B>
Basically the main problem is the attitude
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#78:1:B>
This they want to keep themselves clean but they don't take the responsibility of cleaning their environment
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#79:1:B>
The I think it 's very typical of Filipinos
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#80:1:B>
They are very clean with themselves but outside around them they don't maintain it clean

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#81:1:C>
You mean they clean themselves without cleaning their surroundings Lits
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#82:1:C>
It follows sometimes that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#83:1:B>
They don't care whether

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#84:1:C>
It reflects your personality
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#85:1:C>
Once you keep yourself clean you also keep your surroundings clean

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#86:1:B>
Not really
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#87:1:B>
Uh they will throw their garbage at their neighbor 's place

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#88:1:C>
It is because they live in a surrounding which is not really that clean so naturally it comes you know <O> laughter </O> in the way they live

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#89:1:B>
But Filipinos normally are clean with themselves
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#90:1:B>
They know how to take a bath every day even though they are in the squatter area

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#91:1:C>
Uh-huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#92:1:B>
But where they dispose their garbage God knows

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#94:1:C>
Because the garbage problem is not really a problem that you keep to yourself
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#95:1:C>
It 's an it 's an economic and social problem
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#96:1:C>
It 's a problem of the the city <indig> di ba </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#97:1:C>
How how you dispose of your garbage <{> <[> <,> </[> that 's one reason 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#98:1:B>
<[> Talking of </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#100:1:B>
Speaking of uh disposing of garbage I think they have opened again the uh this <{> <[> garbage dump </[> in Tondo

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#101:1:C>
<[> Landfill </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#102:1:C>
Smokey

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#103:1:B>
Smokey Mountain

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#104:1:C>
Smokey Mountain

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#105:1:A>
Yeah

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#106:1:C>
<{> <[> They 're dumping again </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#107:1:A>
<[> Because I think uh </[> </{> the the current uh dumping ground in Payatas I think is scheduled to be closed so

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#108:1:B>
<{> <[> Yes </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#109:1:A>
<[> The </[> </{> one that 's in uh the one that is located in uh near Antipolo

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#110:1:C>
Uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#111:1:B>
It 's going to be closed by the end of the year and I think uh the Metro Manila Authority has not found a suitable replacement up to this point in time
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#112:1:B>
They were thinking of Cavite but uh the I think the local government people there does not allow this to happen because it will cause a lot of environmental problems

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#113:1:C>
I think no one nobody

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#114:1:B>
Likes garbage

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#115:1:C>
Likes garbage

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#116:1:A>
How could they do it in other countries
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#117:1:A>
Do you do you know of any of the systems that is being done in the other countries

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#118:1:B>
Well most uh countries they do they have a recycling program where bottles or plastics are stored in or thrown in a special uh disposal area
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#119:1:B>
Let 's say all bottles are consolidated uh all papers are also consolidated in one area and then these are all recycled
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#120:1:B>
And then let 's say organic garbage such as uh kitchen refuse
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#121:1:B>
Normally it goes to their sewage system because they have what we call uhm digester in their sinks
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#122:1:B>
Well in the Philippines our sewage system exists only in Manila and especially in the old part of Manila and the rest they don't have the sewage system

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#123:1:A>
And the system in Manila is an old system way way back pre-war years I think

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#124:1:B>
Yes it 's pre-war years and that 's why in certain uh houses in Malate Ermita they don't have uhm septic tanks because it 's all disposed in the sewage system separate
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#125:1:B>
The rest of us the rest of the areas make use of the septic tank

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#126:1:A>
Another thing that uh the problem of Manila is the transportation <indig> ano </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#127:1:A>
They could not organize themselves in such a way that uh it will be advantageous to the people you know like for example in in other countries they have this uh well organized uh

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#129:1:C>
Mass transport system

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#130:1:A>
Mass transport
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#131:1:A>
Of course we have already started the M T R <&> should be M R T which stands for Metro Rail Transit </&> the L R T <&> Light Railway Transit </&> but uh we need to have more

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#132:1:C>
Hopefully

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#133:1:A>
I think we need to have more
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#134:1:A>
I think we have to have good links with this uh rail system when after the people are going down in their station they have connections

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#135:1:C>
Yeah
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#136:1:C>
You know Jun how I wish they they had you know built a train along along the South Super Highway rather than built that Skyway because it will be more advantageous if they ever did the train thing

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#137:1:A>
Yeah but they

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#138:1:C>
Then I won't be able to bring my car to Makati <{> <[> anymore </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#139:1:B>
<[> No need </[> </{> to bring

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#140:1:A>
Yeah but the other thing I heard that uh Ayala is <{> <[> uh </[> thinking of that

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#141:1:C>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#142:1:C>
Supposed to be

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#143:1:A>
That uh that that that <.> pro </.> project

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#144:1:C>
Yeah supposed to be
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#145:1:C>
But I 'd I hope Ayala will not change its mind

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#146:1:A>
Especially now <{> <[> that uh </[> the the oil prices are uncontrollable <indig> ha </indig> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#147:1:C>
<[> Its mind </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#148:1:C>
Yes

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#150:1:B>
You know it 's so expensive

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#151:1:C>
It 's not easy to bring your

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#152:1:A>
I think the <{> <[> the more they raise it </[> the more our economy will be affected uh negatively because it might cause some recession

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#153:1:C>
<[> Your car every day </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#154:1:A>
And uh you you can also notice our economy our economic situation right now is not in at its best
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#155:1:A>
You can see that the Philippine peso has gone down to

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#156:1:C>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#157:1:A>
Forty-four to one again
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#158:1:A>
One U S dollar is in fact uh some of them are projecting that this will go up up to forty-six pesos

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#159:1:B>
And this will affect the cost of fuel <indig> 'no </indig> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#160:1:C>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#161:1:B>
Because first the cost of money and then the cost also of the oil
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#162:1:B>
It 's quite the oil has increased in cost although Saudi Arabia is trying to produce more to bring down the cost of the oil

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#163:1:A>
This will be a domino effect again
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#164:1:A>
Now when we increase the oil prices prices of goods will go up and then uh the workers will demand

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#165:1:C>
Then people will demand for more wages

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#166:1:A>
Right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#167:1:A>
And then what will be the result
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#168:1:A>
We will not be competitive in the world market anymore

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#169:1:B>
I think we no longer are competitive
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#170:1:B>
We 're only good for <,> expensive items <,> or specialty items that can be only produced here but if they cannot be produced here
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#171:1:B>
Normally the other countries like Thailand China Indonesia and especially maybe the former communist countries like Burma and maybe in the near future North Korea will be <,> uh benefiting from the the world market because of the they have lower prices

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#172:1:A>
Because in the year two zero zero four it 's going to be a global uh world market uh there will be no more import restrictions
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#173:1:A>
<{> <[> Whoever can </[> produce <.> th </.> the cheapest and high quality uh will will be able to be the successful one

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#174:1:C>
<[> No more quotas </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#175:1:B>
But I think that 's a very myopic view from the point of view of the <,> of the rich countries

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#176:1:A>
What do you mean <mention> myopic </mention> why

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#177:1:B>
Because they only look from their own point of view
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#178:1:B>
Actually the ones who benefit are the rich countries

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#179:1:A>
Do you mean <{> <[> do you mean </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#180:1:B>
<[> Poor countries </[> </{> will become poorer

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#181:1:A>
Do you mean to say that we should still impose uh import restrictions

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#182:1:B>
I believe so

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#183:1:C>
<{> <[> In a way </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#184:1:A>
<[> To protect </[> </{> the local industries

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#185:1:C>
In a way that will help us
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#186:1:C>
That 's a commitment <,,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#187:1:B>
What do you mean <mention> commitment </mention> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#188:1:C>
Commitment
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#189:1:C>
If there are quotas I am committed to <{> <[> share </[> this much 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#190:1:B>
<[> Uh </[> </{> yes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#192:1:B>
Of course

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#193:1:C>
Because there are still restrictions restraints quantitative limits but if there are no <.> res </.> it 's a global market so everybody is fighting for for his own product
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#194:1:C>
Who buys the best who buys the cheapest

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#195:1:B>
That 's true

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#196:1:A>
And uh you can see the development in the uh in the I T <indig> ha </indig> in the Information Technology
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-050#197:1:A>
