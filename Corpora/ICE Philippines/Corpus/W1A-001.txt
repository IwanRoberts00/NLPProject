I attended the talk of Mr. <@> Ramil de la Vega </@> last Saturday
with the hope that it will help me have a better grasp on the ideas of
post-modernism.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#3:1>
I was not very disappointed in the end but the lack of clear
definitions in his talk made the entire post-modernist idea on tribal
politics very uncertain or somewhat loose.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#4:1>
Last year, when his talk was on post-modernism 's pioneer Bruno Bauer,
I kept hearing Marx instead of Bauer 's ideas.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#5:1>
This is because of his fascination with comparing modernism with
post-modernism.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#6:1>
In this talk, it was his fascination with too many examples that made
post-modernism a foreign language again.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#7:1>
The lack of clear set of definitions on its components before giving
further examples or real situations made his talk wobbly.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#8:1>
There was still direction though. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#9:1>
I tried to come up with notes in his talk but unfortunately I was
only able to grasp a couple of ideas that struck me.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#10:1>
Post-modernism 's stress on the power of the State shows its attack
on modernists.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#11:1>
Most modernists have stressed on either the totality of the State 's
powers or the uselessness of the State.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#12:1>
Post-modernism emphasizes the importance of the basis of the State 's
decisions on rationality.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#13:1>
Although the movement underscores the monopoly of decision making on
the State, there should still be reason in every decision.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#14:1>
This makes the state still accountable to the individual.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#15:1>
The individual is an important factor in the post-modernist view on
politics.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#16:1>
It believes that the interests of individuals cannot be discounted in
favor of other things.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#17:1>
The interest of the individual should be respected by the State.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#18:1>
This only means that politics can never be organized totally.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#19:1>
Post-modernism sees politics as a chaotic world.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#20:1>
Different individuals have different interests and these make the
political world diverse. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#21:1>
Mr. <@> De la Vega </@> gave concrete situations to show the gist
of post-modernism.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#22:1>
Tribal politics in the Philippines seemed perfect for proving the
claims of the post-modernist movement.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#23:1>
The present turncoating of our national leaders to suit their
individual interests show the chaos in politics because of its conflict with
the interests of the individual.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#24:1>
The EDSA uprisings in the meantime still reveals the accountability
of the State to individuals especially when it stops functioning well.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#25:1>
I honestly think that Mr. <@> De la Vega </@> have a good grasp on
post-modernism and its manifestations in present time.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#26:1>
However, to keep the talk in one direction and clear was his big
problem.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#27:1>
As for now, post-modernism remains unconnected set of ideas in my
mind.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#28:1>
There are book definitions of post-modernism that I 've read but they
don't connect with the post-modernism Mr. <@> De la Vega </@> talked about in
his two lectures that I attended. </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#31:2>
My friends and I arrived at the William Shaw Little Theatre
fifteen minutes ahead of the scheduled time.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#32:2>
We took the seats on the fifth row because we really wanted to hear
whatever the speaker has to say for that symposium.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#33:2>
Since we were the early birds present in the said theatre, we stared
at the technical team as they fixed the stage.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#34:2>
While watching a guy setting the overhead projector, there was a
transparency projected that caught our attention.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#35:2>
It was a transparency that has this word printed on it, <mention>
&ldquo; Psychology. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#36:2>
It made us laugh because we thought that we had attended a wrong
seminar.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#37:2>
Imagine, it was in <mention> Philosophy </mention> where we got our
tickets and it was in our system that everything would be related to
<mention> Philosophy </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#38:2>
We did not expect any psychology-related-thing just to pop-out in
that particular talk. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#39:2>
Twenty minutes later, a guy in his shabby <indig> <it> barong
</it> </indig> stood up and introduced the guest-speaker for that afternoon.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#40:2>
The introduced-speaker accepted the applause with a smile and started
to talk.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#41:2>
Honestly, I was so shocked to hear whatever he told us all throughout
that two-hour symposium.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#42:2>
I could not think of a way, during that time, to connect state policy
theory, tribal politics, and <foreign> etc. </foreign> to the topics we were
discussing in our past meetings.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#43:2>
It seemed to me that the talk was more fitted to my last term 's
subject - <mention> Politics and Governance </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#44:2>
I just do not know right now if I was close-minded during the talk
because I really expected something about Socrates, Homer, Empedocles, and
other stuffs related to <mention> Philosophy </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#45:2>
In spite of the frustrations, I listened to whatever he was saying as
a sign of my courtesy and because of my thirst of knowledge regarding
Politics of today. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#46:2>
In the talk the speaker said, and let me cite it, <quote> <it>
&ldquo; Post-modern political system is tribal in nature. &rdquo; </it>
</quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#47:2>
Whatever the politicians of today do to cover-up with glitters the
recent political system, its barbaric and tribal essence still shows up.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#48:2>
Technically speaking, the post-modern political system should ensure
a consolidated public trust.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#49:2>
However, because of the politicians ' self-vested interests this idea
is now becoming fast obsolete.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#50:2>
Yes, we call the political system that we have today as a post-modern
political system as what those <it> politics-know-how </it> people told us to
call it; but, it is crystal clear that most of the ingredients from the
tribal politics still exist.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#51:2>
Such ingredients are manifested in different areas of concern (
<foreign> i.e. </foreign> strategies, elements, and agent 's
responsibilities).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#52:2>
It is true, and I know readers will agree with me that the strategies
of today 's <indig> <it> TRAPO </it> </indig> ( traditional politicians) are
seduction of agents ( citizens), suspicion and panic in the side of the
agent, and manipulation of interest.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#53:2>
These strategies were present during the tribal politics.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#54:2>
Moreover, the elements of tribal politics are still present today
such as politics of desire, politics of fear, and politics of certainty. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#55:2>
It is absurd to refer to our contemporary political system as a
<mention> POST-MODERN </mention> if in reality it is just a recycled tribal
politics. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#56:2>
Allow me to slightly divert my reaction on some current issues
that we have today.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#57:2>
The politics specifically in the Philippines is such a big <foreign>
fa&ccedille;ade </foreign> - a big show on air.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#58:2>
I just do not know if whatever we hear and we see concerning today 's
Philippine politics is just created and eventually sensationalized by the
mass media, but we can get a small portion out of the big picture that it
really is just a show.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#59:2>
Politicians change parties from time to time not because of
principles but because of their selfish desires. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#60:2>
Indeed, whatever the debunked tribal politics possessed is just
coming back into life but of new form, with new key players, having slightly
modified strategies to match up with today 's level of thinking. </p> </I>

<h> Reaction Paper </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#63:3>
Puno, Pia

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#64:3>
Frankly, I found the talk on Post-Modernism boring.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#65:3>
And I know I 'm not alone, because as I glanced around the room, out
of sheer boredom and desperation to do something else, I saw most of the
people going off into dreamy dreamland.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#66:3>
I myself dozed off, my <quote> <it> &ldquo; five-minute lapses
&rdquo; </it> </quote> as I call it.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#67:3>
Politics just doesn't interest me.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#68:3>
Maybe if the speaker, Dr. <@> De la Vega </@> , talked about a
different realm of philosophy, like those of Aristotle and Socrates and those
other smart dead guys, now those would be more up my speed!

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#69:3>
Not to mention, most of the things he discussed I 've already heard [
and learned?] from my previous POLIGOV class just last term.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#70:3>
Actually it was a <it> little </it> interesting to hear the speaker
mention some familiar terms, it redeemed my waning faith that I <it> did
</it> and <it> do </it> learn something from my past classes! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#71:3>
In fairness, boring as it was, I did take down quite a <it> few
</it> notes [ surrounded by <it> a lot </it> of doodles!], of which I will
give an overview.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#72:3>
The speaker discussed the <bold> State Policy Theory </bold> ,
something that 's not new to me, which determines the rationality of a
policy.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#73:3>
He also discussed the <bold> Modern Political Arena </bold> , of
which policy-making is and should be monopolized by the Nation-State, though
it could not interfere with theory-making.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#74:3>
He then talked about the <bold> Post-Modern Political Arena </bold> ,
in which the erosion of state 's monopoly on policy-making is attributed to:
( 1) the inability to accommodate the accumulated needs of interest groups;
and ( 2) the scarcity of resources.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#75:3>
Under Post-Modern Politics are: ( 1) Relative Placidity; ( 2)
Grievance; ( 3) Discontent; and ( 4) Protest.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#76:3>
Then there 's <bold> Tribal Politics </bold> , where three strategies
were mentioned: ( 1) Seduction of Agents; ( 2) Suspicion and Panic; and ( 3)
Manipulation of Interest.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#77:3>
Its three elements were also discussed: ( 1) Politics of Desire; ( 2)
Politics of Fear; and ( 3) Politics of Certainty.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#78:3>
Lastly, the responsibilities of the agents were stated, namely: ( 1)
Critical attitude towards issues; ( 2) Active participation; and ( 3)
Vigilance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#79:3>
See maybe if we were to talk about the smart dead guys, I might
just go into my <quote> <it> &ldquo; three-minute lapses &rdquo; </it>
</quote> instead of five. </p> </I>

Everything, everything, is inescapably intertwined with <mention>
Desire </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#83:4>
Back at the William Shaw Little Theater, I could just see my
miniature <mention> Buddha </mention> - with his enormous stomach, shiny bald
head and infectious smile - squealing with smug delight as Mr. <@> De la Vega
</@> discussed just how the Philippine state has become a willing prostitute
to the caprices of non-state elements of society.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#84:4>
Yes, international law, interest groups and gullible masses are
hungrily, wantonly leering at the government as it holds the reins of
policy-making. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#85:4>
Well, okay, not just leering.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#86:4>
More like seizing it by the neck and shackling it like a puppet. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#87:4>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#90:4>
One characteristic of Philippine politics is the inconsistency in
the acceptance of policies.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#91:4>
A senator, for instance, would announce his stand on a certain
controversial issue.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#92:4>
After being criticized by the media and verbally stoned by the people
through surveys and phone-in radio shows, he would twist his purposefully
ambiguous statement into something more suitable to the public.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#93:4>
He would also, of course, promise a short-term solution that would
appease the people for a while, then blow up like a time bomb in a year or
so. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#94:4>
Plato ( if he were to follow Hollywood-Night-of-the-Living-Dead
tradition) would probably rise with his grimy body from his grave if he
learned of the circumstances in the Philippine political arena.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#95:4>
<quote> 'What?' </quote> he would exclaim, <quote> 'Where 's your
theory?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#96:4>
Where 's your Reason?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#97:4>
Where is your frigging immutable, eternal and PERFECT innate
knowledge, for <foreign> Demiurgo </foreign> 's sake?!' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#98:4>
He would have a reason to be enraged because <mention> Reason
</mention> is being subsumed by the emotions and desires of some sectors -
<mention> 'some' </mention> being the operative term, because, as Mr. <@> De
la Vega </@> had put it, <quote> 'it is humanly impossible' </quote> to
accommodate the wants of all sectors of society. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#99:4>
Political theory <quote> 'determines the moral foundation of
government policy', </quote> and <quote> 'selects the most rational choice.'
</quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#100:4>
It is systematically organized, and it serves to legitimize
government policy.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#101:4>
On the contrary, the post-Modernist view emphasizes that it is
important to seduce, if possible, all citizens into trusting and supporting
the politicians because it is their trust that legitimizes the government 's
actions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#102:4>
This process of seduction has resorted to embarrassing singing
and dancing onstage, complete with matinee idols and sexy dancers, just to
win the electorate 's heart. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#103:4>
Machiavelli is leering at me and nudging my rib. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#104:4>
<quote> 'The end justifies the means,' </quote> he says. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#105:4>
But not for me, not for Socrates. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#106:4>
Besides, the ends of most politicians are not so good anyway.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#107:4>
Their ends are their own self-interests.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#108:4>
They are not concerned about the good of the people; they only care
about their personal vested interests.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#109:4>
For them, policy is just a product of the deliberation on what
policy would accommodate the most number of sectors, on which move would
please the most people.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#110:4>
Hence Ramos ' proposition of a <mention> 'rainbow coalition'
</mention> which tries to consolidate all sectoral interests into one policy
of governance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#111:4>
The citizens are not much better off, either.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#112:4>
Interest groups are observed to be pushing for policies that would
provide them with the most gain, and since they are very capable of creating
hype in conjunction with the media, their effects are becoming more and more
pervasive.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#113:4>
Voters would go for candidates whom they think would put food on
their tables or support their businesses, regardless of any fixed standard or
moral premise. </p> ***

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#114:4>
I was glad that the underlying forces behind social weather and
rallies and cheap propaganda have finally arranged themselves into
near-coherence in my head.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#115:4>
The lecture about tribal politics painted quite a familiar and
accurate picture of the Philippines at present and I could not help but smile
sardonically at the absurdity of it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#116:4>
It becomes apparent that people seem to no longer have any inner
conviction towards what they fight for.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#117:4>
There seems to be an absence of righteous indignation in its truest
sense; even big political movements are just convenient guises for what I
personally deem as ignorance and conformity.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#118:4>
Their cries, however loud, no longer sound like the Platonic echoes
of <quote> &ldquo; souls yearning for perfection &rdquo; </quote> ; they are
like the instinctive wails of a hungry infant. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#119:4>
Or has it always been that way? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#120:4>
Hume would nod vigorously. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#121:4>
Plato would suggest aristocracy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#122:4>
And Freud would ....

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#123:4>
ehehehe ... </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#124:4>
As for me ... </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#125:4>
Er ... </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#126:4>
Argh.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#127:4>
Math is so much easier. </p> 

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#128:4>
P. S. I didn't realize how hard it is to write something that
has to do with Philosophy until now.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-001#129:4>
Too many thoughts. </p> </I>
