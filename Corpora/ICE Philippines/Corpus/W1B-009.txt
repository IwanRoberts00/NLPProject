December 1, 1997

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#2:1>
Dear Tish,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#3:1>
I decided to write you as the year is too long to be cramped in a
card!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#4:1>
The year has its highs for us.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#5:1>
First, Liesl 's 'special project' at the office - - handling the
caseload of the California State University campuses in the southland - -
demanded special attention and more time.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#6:1>
She also got promoted to a higher classification after a grueling exam
and interview where she beat six more seasoned and older people; she now has
to stand our teasing about being serious and dressing up more.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#7:1>
Liz likes to wear sneakers and pretend she is still a student at UC
San Diego.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#8:1>
But she now makes the effort to sound older over the phone. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#9:1>
Angela, 24, has gotten engaged to Steve Carpenter, a 27-year old
history major, on Valentine 's day.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#10:1>
Steve had gotten on his knees and had given her a bouquet of roses
and in the middle of the bouquet was a fake velvet rose that doubled as a
ring box.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#11:1>
They are now preparing for their wedding next year at the Mission Inn
in Riverside.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#12:1>
( Her classmates had gotten married in Funky California fashion: at
the winery in Temecula, on a boat at Santa Catalina islands, in Las Vegas.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#13:1>
Thank God Angela and Steve chose to be married in a 200-year old
church of St. Francis de Assisi, with a gold leaf altar that reminded her of
the Spanish churches in Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#14:1>
I don't think I can stand a wedding at the beach or in a winery.)
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#15:1>
Ting graduated from the University of California at Riverside on
June 14, 1997.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#16:1>
She was done with the units, but the commencement march was in June.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#17:1>
Steve 's parents, Ross and Cynthia Carpenter, drove from their Oxnard
home to Riverside just to see her graduate and have dinner with us at the
Cask N'Cleaver.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#18:1>
Steve 's older brother Ron, who is working for his PhD and teaching
at the University of Utah, also drove down to be with the family.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#19:1>
Franz opened a bottle of Dom Perignon for the occasion.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#20:1>
We had sent her graduation announcements to relatives and friends:
both Arlene Talon ( Resti 's younger sister) and Jonathan Gatmaitan, Angela 's
cousin now studying law at Pierce College in New Hamsphire, wrote back:
<quote> &ldquo; I feel old seeing Tinker Bell 's graduation picture! &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#21:1>
Ting had started working at the Alta Loma school district as a
substitute teacher while keeping her job at a crafts store at the mall on
weekends.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#22:1>
She really enjoys working with small children, who shower her with
pencil drawings and ask her if they can go home with her.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#23:1>
The drawback is that Ting usually looks so young that she is mistaken
for one of the students herself.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#24:1>
It is not unusual for Ting to come home with stories of how she was
mistakenly taken for a junior high student herself. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#25:1>
Franz and I celebrated our 29th wedding anniversary in June by
spending a quiet weekend in Santa Barbara, which is my favorite weekend
place.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#26:1>
The Pacific Ocean in June is just so beautiful to look at.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#27:1>
At home, we started gathering our bumper crop of plums, peaches and
gala apples.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#28:1>
The <foreign> loquat </foreign> and Asian pears did not do so well
this year.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#29:1>
Ting gathered the apricots and made dozens of jars of apricot jam,
the best we have tasted ever. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#30:1>
Celia, on the other hand, is living dangerously.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#31:1>
She has been supervising the projects of Benckiser, the company she
works for, and taking trips to Europe where the manufacturing plants are.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#32:1>
Once, when Air France went on strike, Celia took a commuter flight
from New York to Manchester to Paris.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#33:1>
Her luggage was lost and she ended up being &ldquo; creative &rdquo;
in her change of outfits for her meetings in Paris and the short stay in
Monaco, where the plant is.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#34:1>
We called it Murphy 's Law on its roll for her.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#35:1>
Another time, she was in Barcelona for a few days and was scheduled
to leave for London and she was mugged.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#36:1>
She had taken dinner with a friend and was walking back to the Hilton
when someone came running, in a crouched position, hit her back and took her
Louis Vuitton purse.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#37:1>
She started to run after the mugger, but her friend shouted, <quote>
&ldquo; Celia, don't!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#38:1>
He might hurt you. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#39:1>
She was right, and Celia stopped.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#40:1>
The Hilton helped her get her credit cards canceled, secured the
airline ticket for London and Celia went on her scheduled trip to London.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#41:1>
Murphy 's Law worked overtime that time. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#42:1>
On my 50th birthday, Franz and I spent four days in Del Mar, my
other favorite city.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#43:1>
It 's just so quiet and peaceful there and the old fashioned inn we
stayed in is a stone 's throw from the Pacific Ocean.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#44:1>
I did not need any consoling; I told everyone my age!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#45:1>
I am looking forward to 60, maybe I will be a grandmother then. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#46:1>
Ginger and Samson have continued to grow.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#47:1>
Ginger, 3, is Steve 's dog.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#48:1>
She is a mixture of a dobie and a lab.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#49:1>
Her mix had produced an elegant, highly intelligent lady, one who
walks gracefully and loves faithfully and guards fearlessly.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#50:1>
Her soft brown eyes and light brown fur belie her determination - -
to go after birds and the mailman, to get at your steak, to get you outside
and play ball with her.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#51:1>
Samson, 2, is Angela 's baby dog: all graceful trot, black fur with
gray undercoat, and the audacity and curiosity of a muddy little boy.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#52:1>
Both dogs have been devoted to Steve and Angela.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#53:1>
What is most touching is Angela 's devotion to both of them.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#54:1>
She takes very good care of them, brushes them regularly, takes them
to the vet, and finds humor in everything they do.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#55:1>
The dogs have made her a better person.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#56:1>
Liesl and I have done our share of dogsitting.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#57:1>
When a dog who looked like Ginger came out on the cover of <mention>
Dog Fancy </mention> , we were triumphant: <quote> &ldquo; Ginger is a cover
girl! &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#58:1>
Late this year, both Joshua and John David left Manila to study
abroad.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#59:1>
Josh is at Fordham U for his masters in international economics; he
lives in a Trump apartment building overlooking Central Park three blocks
away from his school.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#60:1>
John David is spending a year at the London School of Economics for
his masters in law.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#61:1>
Both girls, Geri and Gwen, are doing their residency in Philadelphia.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#62:1>
James is putting up his trading firm in Manila, Jonathan is in his
junior year at law school in New Hamsphire and next year, Peter is coming out
to get his doctorate.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#63:1>
All of Andres ' and Baby 's kids ' studies are almost over!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#64:1>
Except for the baby, Jerome.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#65:1>
Ben 's daughters are graduating: Genny from Rice University in
Houston and Linette from Trinity School in Fort Worth.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#66:1>
Genny is doing interviews for med school and Linette is looking
forward to Georgetown for her college degree.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#67:1>
Celia 's 2 daughters are both in school, Rosalyn at the University of
North Carolina and Annabelle at Texas A&M.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#68:1>
Annabelle did something extraordinary we are all proud of: she
attended the Marine boot camp in Paris Island and actually got through it
all!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#69:1>
She now has a 4-year scholarship in college.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#70:1>
Annabelle 's guts and determination truly amazed all of us.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#71:1>
Ester 's sons are both working and Jeannette 's babies are all in
school. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#72:1>
This Christmas, Franz and I will be with his mother and brothers
and their families.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#73:1>
We are hoping Veda will come and visit again, so we can all be
together.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#74:1>
Tish, how are you?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#75:1>
Life must be so hectic in Manila; I have not heard from you.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#76:1>
Norma sent me a postcard from London and she says she will be back in
Singapore before Christmas.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#77:1>
Take care! </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#78:1>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#79:2>
January 23, 2002

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#80:2>
Dearest Tish,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#81:2>
This is Angela 's baby, Stevie, born June 6, 2001.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#82:2>
I am enclosing a photograph of him taken more recently.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#83:2>
I 'd probably be classified as a 'besotted grandmother' but I don't
mind being called that.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#84:2>
Franz and I and Liesl drive to Rancho Cucamonga, where Angela and
Steve live, and take Angela out to lunch and shopping at the nearby Ontario
Mills.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#85:2>
This Saturday, though, Angela and Steve are watching a hockey game at
Staples in LA, so we three are baby sitting the whole afternoon.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#86:2>
He is at a stage where everything goes to the mouth, and he always
wants to take tentative steps, so he tires all of us. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#87:2>
I do enjoy the baby but I marvel at the way Angela has taken the
responsibility of motherhood and has learned to juggle work and parenthood.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#88:2>
<indig> Alam mo naman dito, Tish, walang yaya! </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#89:2>
And Angela insists on breastfeeding, so it 's double trouble!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#90:2>
She wakes up early, breastfeeds, pumps, bundles the baby to a
babysitter near the school where she teaches, and picks him up at 3:30 p.m.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#91:2>
She established a schedule so he and she take a walk, then she feeds
him, gives him a bath, and puts him to sleep by 8:30 p.m.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#92:2>
Steve helps by doing part of the housework and looking after the baby
on Mondays when he does not work.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#93:2>
Parenthood is taken very seriously over here.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#94:2>
Franz and I can only help so that the parents won't feel the burden
too heavily.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#95:2>
On their third ( or is it fourth?) wedding anniversary, they are
taking a night off to be by themselves in Santa Barbara, so they are dropping
Stevie off at her mother-in-law 's house.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#96:2>
We get to take care of the dogs overnight. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#97:2>
Both Franz and Liesl have entered into the spirit of having a new
member of the family.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#98:2>
Franz pushes the stroller when we are at the mall; once he even
amazed everyone by crawling on the floor!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#99:2>
<quote> &ldquo; What a milestone, &rdquo; </quote> so Liesl says.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#100:2>
This year, we were able to take off only a few times - to San
Francisco and San Diego.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#101:2>
We had scheduled a vacation in the east coast last October, but the
September 11 attack made us postpone the trip.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#102:2>
We hope to go and take our vacation this spring. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#103:2>
Did I tell you that one of Andres ' sons, Joshua, works for
Cantor Fitzgerald?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#104:2>
Yes, the trading company that occupied four floors of the tower that
was completely demolished.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#105:2>
Fortunately, Josh works for another division in another building
nearby.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#106:2>
They were immediately evacuated, but he said he saw flying limbs as
he went down the stairs.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#107:2>
He and his wife, Patricia Tuason-Pernia walked across the bridge and
took a ferry to NJ where an aunt lives.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#108:2>
We feel he was so traumatized by the event.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#109:2>
The apartment where they stayed was on the 10th floor, so he and
Patricia had to go down the fire escape - ten floors! - because they were
told that there might be a gas leak in the building. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#110:2>
Celia walked more than ten blocks to get home to NJ from her
Fifth Avenue office.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#111:2>
She tried to call a cousin of ours who lived in a co-op in
Manhattan, but Ofelia was vacationing in Nova Scotia. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#112:2>
Fe Wanner did call me several times from Victoria - before and
after her trip to Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#113:2>
She enjoys traveling a lot. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#114:2>
Norma dropped me a line last month.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#115:2>
She still divides her time between Sydney and Singapore.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#116:2>
Did she tell you of her sister passing away?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#117:2>
Cancer took Erlinda.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#118:2>
I still remember her - she is very pretty - coming by Philets to
give something to Norma. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#119:2>
My advanced birthday greetings - it is February, is it not?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#120:2>
How is La Salle these days?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#121:2>
Tish, my sister sent me a copy of <mention> <foreign> Toro
</foreign> </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#122:2>
I was saddened by that film.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#123:2>
It is very real and it raises the issues of prostitution in the
Philippines - male, female and child.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#124:2>
And I watched the film after reading about the most beautiful homes
in the Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#125:2>
Liesl had given me a book that featured the homes of the Zobels and
Boy Santos and the others - <indig> nakakaiyak naman iyong film. </indig>
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#126:2>
My regards to everyone--

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#127:2>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#128:2>
P.S. Nicklas was taken from Niklas Lindstrom, the hockey player
of the Red Wings.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#129:2>
Angela is a hockey fan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#130:2>
Picture me with Stevie strapped to a <mention> Baby Bjorn
</mention> - another name for a papoose - and Stevie hanging/dangling from my
neck and chest.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#131:2>
A regular baby kangaroo.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#132:2>
We go to the mall with Stevie.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#133:2>
When he kicks his legs and flails his arms, I get a real work out.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-009#134:2>
( I don't know what kind of paper this is, Liesl 's paper - but
erasures don't work on this paper.) </p> </I>
