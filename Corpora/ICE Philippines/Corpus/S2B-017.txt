Armed Forces Intelligence Service Chief Colonel Victor Corpus may have violated A F P regulations number two hundred dash zero one three relative to his public revelations of an intelligence report when he linked Senator Panfilo Lacson to alleged money laundering activity
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-017#82:6:A>
This possibility was raised today by Senator Rodolfo Biazon
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-017#83:6:A>
Biazon explains that reports prepared by the members of the intelligence community are classified into two categories one is when it involves national security and the other when it affects the right of a person which is criminal in nature
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-017#84:6:A>
If an intelligence report affects the security of the state according to Biazon divulging the report has to undergo a process of declassification which only the Secretary of National Defense or the President is authorized to do so
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-017#85:6:A>
Biazon assessed that Corpus may have committed a grave irregularity in the treatment of an intelligence report affecting national security when he divulged such without clearance from the appropriate persons of authority as regulated by law
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-017#86:6:A>
He saw that he said that since no official treatment of the intelligence information has been undertaken he doubts the propriety of the Senate to proceed with any investigation
