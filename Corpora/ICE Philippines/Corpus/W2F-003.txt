<h> <bold> MUD: A Memory </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#2:1>
<h> <bold> Part I </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#3:1>
<bold> From the stone watchtower on a strip of barren coastal land
near Santander, Arcadio had a view of two islands forever reaching out to
each other - a vista that roused in him a longing to touch all the broken
shards of the Philippine archipelago and all the nameless people with whom he
shared a common culture and history. </bold> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#4:1>
<bold> By RENATO E. MADRID </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#5:1>
<bold> The </bold> year Arcadio was born had been marked by
several personal disasters on the part of his father.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#6:1>
It was the worst single year of Capitan Delfin 's already long
existence, but that was according to his own estimate.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#7:1>
And since people only tend to lie about their good fortunes but
readily go into the minutest details about the worst things that could
happen, he may have been right. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#8:1>
The crops failed that year, mainly through infestations of various
kinds which ignored all human ingenuity and denied the usefulness of previous
experience.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#9:1>
Farmers recommended to each other the torching of entire fields,
offering that service to those who lacked the same ruthlessness to put their
own children to the sword if these should ever be guilty of choosing death
over dishonor.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#10:1>
From eating remnants of the infestation mixed in with their ordinary
feed - a loss-cutting measure on the part of some livestock-raisers - the
first hundred head of cattle died.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#11:1>
The unintentional poison feeding was at first denied, then owned up
to in the interests of the common good, before it was completely and
resolutely discontinued.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#12:1>
And so there was a total absence of an explanation for the deaths
that still continued to take place. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#13:1>
Nor did the animal husbandry detectives dispatched to Valladolid
by the Bureau find a trace of the culprit among the veritable salad of
f1uids, tissue samples and wastes they had extracted with flamboyant and
superior air, or merely picked off the soiled grass in their desperation
later.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#14:1>
Through a good part of that awful year, encountering a number of dead
animals became almost the natural expectation of a casual walk through the
rural landscape, even in the remotest pastures of the village.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#15:1>
One learned to look past them at other points of interest or simply
hurried away, and understandably developed a sudden preference for fish
especially in the restaurants.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#16:1>
There seemed to be nothing anyone could do for the poor animals and
in their present or future condition they could only be useful in an oblique
way: it became a propitious time to impress on youngsters ( to whom the
deaths were more diverting than distressing) something about the
precariousness of life and the importance of good eating habits. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#17:1>
But many a parent who started out with such intentions soon
learned to be inventive about answering questions on God 's deep and lasting
hatred for farm animals, and what practical uses the devil might have for a
pair of horns.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#18:1>
( One of the first sights of the infant Arcadio from the kitchen
window, while being carried in his nurse 's arms, was of stiff-legged
creatures floating down the river, toylike in the simplicity of death,
apparently weightless, and idly turning in the placid waters as they flowed
past his father 's torched fields toward the delta and the sea.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#19:1>
But it was something of which, in later life, he would have
absolutely no recollection whatsoever.) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#20:1>
Delfin was not the village <foreign> Capitan </foreign> yet, not
for a long while, and so he had time to waste on some of the fine things in
life - - some of them less useful than farm animals dead or alive, but
notches higher.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#21:1>
He loved poetry for the way it lifted the clouds of sameness and
ordinariness that seemed permanently fixed above a man 's life on the farm,
but it was not the poetry you found in a book nor the kind you listen to
patiently until you begin to doubt your own hearing or your knowledge of the
words.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#22:1>
This, too, would bring him added misfortune, but in his self-deluded
way he would look at the inconvenience as hostility aimed at poetry rather
than at himself, or more simply still as another way for him to recall with
increased sense of gratitude ( if that were possible) the year his son was
born. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#23:1>
Then the deaths stopped altogether; stopped with noticeable
abruptness, as if they had been day-laborers looking out for a man with a
stopwatch and whistle rather than an hourglass and a scythe.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#24:1>
Even beasts thought to be on their last legs were observed, at a
certain hour on a certain day, suddenly raising themselves up on all fours,
and beginning to manifest once again every sign of good health in addition to
an alarming appetite.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#25:1>
It was tempting to surmise that the stupid beasts had been
play-acting all along, some even carrying the pretense far beyond the limits
of mortality.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#26:1>
But most of the villagers, except for those few who normally chose
the colorful over the logical, preferred to attribute the end of the animal
plague to a miracle that the sincerity of their faith had caused to happen -
- faith, and a chain of Masses being offered at the small village church by a
visiting priest, the first in Valladolid 's memory to ever hold ( with or
without the promised results) a Votive liturgy to address their needs but in
an earthy, custom-made, no-nonsense way that they found so consoling. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#27:1>
The much-reiterated <it> Mass for the Speedy Conclusion of a
Pestilence </it> , combining the stark simplicity of its essentials with
severe unaccompanied chant and an almost businesslike Intention, was clearly
a battering-ram of a prayer with which to storm heaven and bend ( without
grating) the Divine Ear.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#28:1>
In retrospect its directly intended result of <quote> &ldquo; God 's
greater power demonstrated by the lifting of an evil and undeserved curse"
</quote> <it> ( Unrevised Text) </it> was a far better explanation for those
strange animal happenings than the other existing explanation ( still making
the rounds) which was emotionally disturbing in addition to carrying pagan
overtones. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#29:1>
<bold> The </bold> only place to catch a flavor of that
explanation was in the conversations of elderly Valladolid folk, who were the
only ones possessed of a faith that allowed them to be moved by mountains,
forests, streams and the like, at the same time that they were actually
enthralled by the comparatively recent story of a loving God who allowed
Himself to be nailed to a cross.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#30:1>
The elderly were the greater number of the adults in Valladolid and
had carried the burdens of its multitudinous farms under generations of
landlords varying from sullen friars who corrected remnant heathen practices
with a beating from their dangling rosaries to listless, younger sons who
never minded if the peasants grew little more than grass under their feet so
long as their daughters were clean.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#31:1>
There were none among these long-suffering veterans but had families
to keep them well-clothed and fed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#32:1>
But the soil was to them as the air we breathe, thus it was not
rare to find them with their fingers rooting in the soil until last minute of
the day before they died, or else crowded like a convocation of mutes at an
eatery table, embalming themselves beforehand with potent betel juices and
young vinegar ( surely not for the young), with no talk except of soil on
their lips, and soil in their hearts and in their brains. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#33:1>
According to their explanation, the village 's plant and animal
troubles could only have occurred when they did; for wasn't that year a major
anniversary for the great mudslide?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#34:1>
Which particular anniversary it was, the old villagers refused to be
precise about the matter, but this refusal was by no means due to deadened
faculties.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#35:1>
Their farmer 's intuition was well acquainted with the peculiar way
Nature was given to initiating or protracting certain spells that clearly
served none but her own ends.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#36:1>
From long and careful experience the old farmers grew to recognize
them as spells of simple recall and self-congratulation on Nature 's part.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#37:1>
But for this insight to be useful to their understanding of that
tight-lipped and easily irked task-mistress ( the wielding of a tremendous
and unfathomable power had got them past the gender problem with no trouble
at all) they had to go back farther to the quality of sounds they had only
had the opportunity to hear in deserted and cavernous places where the
quality of sacredness was such as to silence the impertinence of toads and
quell arrogance from its roots, in the heart.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#38:1>
Only there did the structure of sound yield itself in such way to
their curiosity that it allowed them to discover how even the faintest noises
actually cause reflections of themselves to be repeated a number of times in
a number of complementary places, although quite soon those reflections
become unsuitable for any human to grasp.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#39:1>
What could be grasped, they already knew to be echoes, but echoes
whose very limited number spoke more of the feebleness of their own
concentration than of the power that simply went on and on without regard for
audience. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#40:1>
It was precisely the way ( they slowly learned) with cataclysms
as with any simple events that were within the scope of Nature to produce - -
from the birth of a continent to the untimely death of a child.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#41:1>
As hidden movements beneath the earth or wild volcanic tantrums are
never abruptly concluded but must continue to display, over an amazingly long
period, some brooding, even godlike retrospecting ( or very plainly,
rumblings), so too every event that happens must happen a number of times
more on a regressively smaller scale, or else find its sympathetic
echo-of-an-event, before it can vanish completely from history and from the
consciousness, not of man, but of the world. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#42:1>
This multiplication of events in Nature, accomplished with no
thought given to the well-being of humankind, has always been observed as
veering definitely toward the painful and the disastrous; and faithfully, as
to its true North.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#43:1>
This would be a frightening matter for us humans to consider even
briefly, had it not been for the consoling fact that we only have one life to
live, thank God, even though in the course of it we may have to suffer
everything at least twice. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#44:1>
But herein lies a maddening corollary to their findings, one
which the old villagers understood equally well: That if Nature had been
kinder, she might have gone on with all this but only after thoughtfully
excluding the element of suspense.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#45:1>
( When the disaster?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#46:1>
When its smaller twin?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#47:1>
In whose lifetime then, if not in this godforsaken lifetime?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#48:1>
<foreign> Etc. </foreign> , <foreign> etc. </foreign>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#49:1>
This is the element <quote> &ldquo; that makes calamity of so long
life &rdquo; </quote> - - knowing what but not when.)

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#50:1>
But Nature loves being mystery woman, and filling each life with
mystery.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#51:1>
It is also by her rule that life, be it that of a lone man or an
entire village, cannot really begin until the mystery repeats itself over and
over, and cannot really be over until all untoward events up to their last 'echo'
shall have been eliminated. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#52:1>
In between these two points all the free space is littered with
the signs and wonders that are Nature 's common and uncommon offerings to
those who inhabit the world; myriad events that serve to brighten a life and
myriads more ( always more) that blot out the sun.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#53:1>
Yet even the happiest events must await her nod of approval, seeing
that the disastrous and painful things she so clearly favors are doomed to
continue defying all prediction; and all this to remain so for as long as she
insists on her own secret and peculiar method for computing time. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#54:1>
Thus, for the intuitive elderly farmers ( dragged along as if by
mistake into the twentieth century, but stuck in Valladolid) the most recent
failure of Delfin 's crops and the village 's crops was nothing if not a
forceful recall, a gesture in nostalgic commemoration of that singular but
too-soon-forgotten obliteration of Valladolid 's once-proud display on the
delta. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#55:1>
It is but fitting that the blame be assigned to those famous
homes of Valladolid 's premier citizens; those parables in wood and glass and
stone, over whose glory men were thought to have challenged Nature as the new
lords and masters of beauty.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#56:1>
At least there were still people around who saw it that way - -
people-echoes of people, vanishing like a dying heart 's detonations or evil
deeds after a true repentance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#57:1>
<bold> Reputedly, </bold> those beautiful old sunken homes had
been arranged neatly around a proud stone church - - a church of the size
befitting a parochia1 seat.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#58:1>
It was also the first church anyone could find upon leaving the city
going South, some 45 kilometers away.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#59:1>
During the disaster its half-open mouth had at first been spared the
onrush of' mud, for the mudflow was coming from the West, while the church
faced East.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#60:1>
But once the mud had risen over half the height of the windows and
begun to harden, a new assault of rains brought on fresh flooding with a
renewed malevolence that sent the mud flowing again, thus finishing the job
of the first onrush: more and yet more mud seeking out every tight-shut or
walled-off place it had missed before.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-003#61:1>
It was a first-class burial job, one that created basements out of
ground floors and threw the proud settlement back to the time before the
invention of stairs. </p> </I>
