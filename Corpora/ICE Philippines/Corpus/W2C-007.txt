<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#4:1>
Selective implementation of a phone metering scheme is being eyed
by government instead of a national application that it said will burden
consumers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#5:1>
Transportation Secretary Vicente Rivera, during a Senate hearing
on a plan of the Philippine Long Distance Co. to implement the telemetering
system, said he has ordered the National Telecommunications Commission to
review the possibility of selective phone metering as a <quote> &ldquo;
compromise. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#6:1>
<quote> &ldquo; There are pros and cons, advantages and
disadvantages with the phone metering scheme...it is my opinion that the
Senate should be given an opportunity to look into these further, &rdquo;
</quote> Rivera said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#7:1>
He said the PLDT ' s argument that the system will discourage
<indig> &ldquo; telebabad &rdquo; </indig> or prolonged and unnecessary use
of the telephone has basis. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#8:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Without phone metering, few people are using the
telephone wisely.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#9:1>
It is my position that we study the matter very carefully, &rdquo;
</quote> Rivera said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#10:1>
The NTC has recalled a provisional authority granted to PLDT
allowing it to implement the local measured service scheme ( LMS). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#11:1>
PLDT and other phone companies want to meter their telephone
services to increase revenues. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#12:1>
Sen. Vicente Sotto, chairman of the committee on public service,
asked phone officials including PLDT president Manuel Pangilinan to come up
with a <quote> &ldquo; special arrangement" </quote> on the telemetering
scheme to lessen the impact on the business and public subscribers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#13:1>
Pangilinan said the proposal might lead to legal problems. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#14:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The potential issue on the selective scheme is
that we might be accused of favoring one at the expense of the other, &rdquo;
</quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#15:1>
He said a universally applied metering scheme will <quote>
&ldquo; correct the long-standing abuse against responsible users across all
income groups. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#16:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The current flat rate scheme forces low income
users to subsidize high-volume users.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#17:1>
In a metered scheme, consumers will pay for what they actually use
and not on top of that, what others abuse, &rdquo; </quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#18:1>
Under the scheme, subscribers will pay 40 centavos in excess of
the 800 free minutes per month charged with a flat rate of &peso;348 a month
for residential subscribers and &peso;748 for business subscribers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#19:1>
By charging higher rates for peak usage periods and discounted
rates for non-peak periods, Pangilinan said, the introduction of LMS should
encourage responsible, optimum use of the network.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#20:1>
A higher number of users can then be accommodated by a given network,
he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#21:1>
In the Philippines, it is likely that demand will come from the
higher-income, better-educated customers who are able to afford the proposed
per minute rates, Pangilinan said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#22:1>
Pangilinan said LMS will promote responsible telephone use and
phone network efficiency. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#23:1>
Basically, he also said, PLDT needed to raise through LMS its
revenues from local telephone operations to offset the reduced income from
its international long distance service, which has been subsidizing local
calls. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#24:1>
He said PLDT can no longer afford to subsidize local operations
because foreign governments like the US have lowered the rates of their
telephone companies, forcing PLDT to reduce its foreign and international
long distance rates to stay competitive. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#25:1>
Besides, he said, it is time that the company rebalance its
tariff and expenditures figures. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#26:1>
PLDT expects to raise its gross revenue by &peso;3 billion in a
year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#27:1>
Pangilinan also said it is ironic that the Internet Service
Providers have raised the metering issue since ISPs themselves charge their
clients metered rates. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#28:1>
Pangilinan said anyone who has a computer and Internet access can
afford LMS. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#29:1>
He said LMS will promote a more productive use of the Internet
rather than just <quote> &ldquo; surfing around &rdquo; </quote> which he
said can be hardly described as educational. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#30:1>
Senate probers proposed that instead of charging consumers a flat
rate, PLDT and other companies charge subscribers on how often and how long
they use the phone. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#31:1>
Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile said the proposed local measured services
is inequitable considering that a flat rate will be imposed on consumers.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#32:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I accept that there 's inequity.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#33:1>
A residential household for example would only use 200 minutes while
another would use up the entire 800 minutes.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#34:1>
They do not have uniform consumption but both would pay &peso;348 per
month, &rdquo; </quote> Enrile said. </p> </I>

If the government and the Marcos family fail to reach an amicable
settlement before the life of the Presidential Commission on Good Government
( PCGG) expires, they may have to face off again, this time in a courtroom.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#38:2>
President Estrada said as much yesterday as he reacted to reports
that the PCGG, after 13 years of failure to recover the so-called ill-gotten
wealth of the Marcoses, is now readying itself for a showdown by hiring a
battery of lawyers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#39:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Well, of course, if there is no settlement we
have to pursue the case, &rdquo; </quote> he said in an ambush interview at
Malaca&ntilde;ang. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#40:2>
After assuming office last June, Estrada gave the PCGG, under
former chairman Felix de Guzman and now Magdangal Elma, one year to wrap up
the ill-gotten wealth cases lodged against the Marcoses and their alleged
cronies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#41:2>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio interview that
Estrada was not keen on extending the life of PCGG.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#42:2>
If it fails to reach an amicable agreement with the Marcoses in the
sharing of the Marcos loot, all the pending cases will then be transferred to
the custody of the Department of Justice for resolution. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#43:2>
He also reiterated that the Marcos family should appoint one
representative who will negotiate with the government for the settlement of
their &dollar;580 million worth of assets. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#44:2>
<quote> &ldquo; We are still confident that in the end, there
will be negotiations for a settlement.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#45:2>
What is needed is for the Marcoses to appoint just one family
representative or negotiator so we could get down to business, &rdquo;
</quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#46:2>
Zamora said the PCGG is preparing for this eventuality.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#47:2>
In case nothing happens to the proposed settlement, they will go for
the forfeiture cases. </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#51:3>
- - Suspected <indig> Moro </indig> Islamic Liberation Front rebels
killed two soldiers in an ambush Monday in Buldon town in Maguindanao as
government peace negotiators met with rebel leaders in the province, the army
said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#52:3>
The MILF denied any involvement in the attack and blamed a
<quote> &ldquo; third group" </quote> out to sabotage peace talks between
government and the rebel group. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#53:3>
No major agreement was inked during the talks Monday held in
Dawa'h Center in <foreign> Sultan </foreign> Kudarat, Maguindanao.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#54:3>
Talks continued Tuesday. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#55:3>
The slain soldiers were on board a jeep on their way back from
the market to their command post in <indig> Barangay </indig> Mercedes in
Buldon at about 11:20 a.m. when a band of <indig> Moro </indig> rebels
attacked them in the village of Cabayuan in Buldon. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#56:3>
The victims have been identified as Cpls. Rolly delos Santos and
Urbano Bendor, both from the Army 's 39th Infantry Battalion stationed in the
town. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#57:3>
Col. Hermogenes Esperon, chief of the AFP Joint Operations
Center, said two teams from the 39th IB conducted pursuit operations but the
enemies withdrew towards <indig> Sitio </indig> Campo in <indig> Barangay
</indig> Ruyod with the soldiers ' M16 rifles. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#58:3>
Ghazali Jaafar, the MILF ' s deputy for political affairs, said
they have identified at least two suspects after receiving reports from rebel
commanders in the area. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#59:3>
Jaafar named the suspects as Imran and Pata.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#60:3>
He said initial MILF reports indicated the slaying was in retaliation
to the killing of the suspects ' unidentified cousin almost three months ago
by government soldiers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#61:3>
<quote> &ldquo; We have sent a small team of MILF fighters to
track down and arrest the suspects and put them in trial by the rebels '
Islamic court, &rdquo; </quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#62:3>
<quote> &ldquo; The suspects belong to a third party out to
sabotage the peace talks, &rdquo; </quote> Jaafar said without elaborating.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#63:3>
Jaafar said the Tuesday peace talks tackled mechanics on the
identification of the 46 so-called MILF-controlled territories. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#64:3>
Jaafar said both panels also discussed the expansion of
membership of the Coordinating Committee on the Cessation of Hostilities (
CCCH) to include military and police officials in the central region. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#65:3>
At present, at least five representatives from each side are
sitting as members of the committee.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#66:3>
About four to six new personnel from both the government and the MILF
are expected to be added to the CCCH. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#67:3>
The same committee will also identify the MILF-controlled areas
in the South, mostly rebel camps. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#68:3>
Lt. Col. Ricardo Terrevillas, civil military operations chief of
the 6th Infantry Division, said the ambush of De los Santos and Bernon
brought to seven ceasefire violations recorded by the military against MILF
since the agreement supposedly took effect last Jan. 30. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#69:3>
But Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado last week said government
has recorded at least 12 ceasefire violations.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#70:3>
He described the violations as <quote> &ldquo; minor &rdquo; </quote>
and discounted the filing of protest on belief that the agreement is holding
well. </p> </I>

</h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#73:4>
<bold> IN a dramatic appearance in court yesterday, President
Estrada forgave his critic Manuel Morato and dropped a libel case against
him. </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#74:4>
The Manila Regional Trial Court dismissed the five-year old case,
in which Mr. Estrada was accused of driving a smuggled car, after Morato
publicly apologized to the President in court. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#75:4>
<quote> &ldquo; I apologize publicly for whatever hurt I have
inflicted on you and your loved ones.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#76:4>

<quote> &ldquo; For the sake of our elderly mothers - who are
both suffering because of our differences, I beg you to reconsider. &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#78:4>
After being sworn in at the witness stand, the President said,
<quote> &ldquo; in the spirit of human compassion, I accept Mr. Morato 's
public apology. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#79:4>

I have taken the higher road of compassion as father of the nation,
&rdquo; </quote> he added. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#81:4>
The President 's remarks drew applause from the crowd that packed
the City Hall session hall where the hearing took place. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#82:4>
The hearing was scheduled at 8:30 a.m. but Morato 's lawyer Romeo
Saavedra asked Judge Juan Nabong, Jr. for more time because his client
decided at the last minute to attend. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#83:4>
Then-vice-president Estrada had sued Morato for libel in 1994 for
a 1993 column in the <mention> Philippine Star </mention> that Morato wrote,
accusing Mr. Estrada of using an imported Cadillac without paying proper
customs duties. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#84:4>
Morato later ran against Mr. Estrada and several other candidates
in the 1998 presidential elections which Mr. Estrada won by a landslide. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#85:4>
The President had previously said he would not forgive Morato and
wanted to see him in jail. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#86:4>
The President 's gesture drew praise from several congressmen.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#87:4>
In a telephone interview, Rep. Heherson Alvarez ( <indig> Lakas
</indig> , Isabela) said Mr. Estrada 's decision to drop his libel case
against Morato showed his <quote> &ldquo; magnanimous side." </quote> </p>

<p>

<quote> &ldquo; Their fight is more intense and deepseated which

I think the President is acting presidential and ... we owe him our

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#91:4>
Negros Oriental 's Jose Apolinario Lozada ( <indig> Lakas

<h> <bold> Claudio says Pasay can pay its workers </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#99:5>
PASAY CITY Mayor Jovito Claudio yesterday debunked claims by City
Treasurer Concepcion Daplas that the city government has no money to pay its
employees. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#100:5>
Interviewed by <mention> Sun Star Manila </mention> , Claudio
insisted the city <quote> &ldquo; has enough to pay the salaries of its
officials and employees. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#101:5>
On Tuesday, Daplas had said there are only &peso;22 million left
in the city 's treasury, not even enough to pay Pasay 's &peso;43.9 million
debt with the Philippine National Bank ( PNB) which is already overdue. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#102:5>
The city spends about &peso;5 million for the salaries of its
3,000 workers, almost half of which are casuals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#103:5>
Daplas said the city hasn't paid its workers for the Oct. 1-15
period. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#104:5>
But Claudio said he had instructed the treasurer to draw the
needed amount from the city 's trust funds, which he said has a balance of
roughly &peso;110 million. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#105:5>
Daplas said she is not aware that Pasay had trust funds. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#106:5>
She said that unless the mayor advances the cash requirements
out of his personal funds, Pasay 's employees will get their pay by December.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#107:5>
Daplas said former Mayor Pablo Cuneta used his own money or
several occasions when the city run out of funds to pay employees. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#108:5>
She said the city was in a financial squeeze because its revenue
collection was not enough to reach the targeted income of &peso;1.2 billion
for 1999. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#109:5>
Daplas said local businessmen and taxpayers stopped paying their
obligations to the city as a result of controversy arising from the &ldquo;
two &rdquo; mayors discharging the same duties. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#110:5>
Even local officials and employees were not sure whose orders to
follow, Claudio or Vice-Mayor Greg Alcera. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#111:5>
Alcera was appointed acting mayor after Claudio was sidelined by
a stroke.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#112:5>
Claudio, however, refused to give up the post to Alcera. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-007#113:5>
Daplan said there were reports that the mayor was too sick to
hold office and that it was his close relatives, including his son, Joji, who
were making directives and decisions <quote> &ldquo; by the authority of the
mayor. &rdquo; </quote> </p>
