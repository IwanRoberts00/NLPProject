<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#30:1:B>
It <{> <[> was really nice </[>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#31:1:A>
<[> My Father 's Daughter </[> </{>

<{> <[> What 's the story </[>

<[> The story </[> </{> is really nice

<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#34:1:A>
What 's the story

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#35:1:B>
About <,> uhm <,,> what 's the story the story 's about uh <,,> the relationship between

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#37:1:A>
Between <{> <[> a father and a daughter and </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#38:1:B>
<[> A father and a daughter </[> </{> then afterwards as they as the <{> <[> kid grow older </[>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#39:1:A>
<[> As the </[> </{> yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#41:1:B>
Yeah what happened is that their relationship becomes different

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#42:1:A>
Their relationship became different why <&> break in the recording </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#44:1:A>
Anyway what happened to that young girl when she got older what happened

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#45:1:B>
When she got older uhm their relationship was strained

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#46:1:A>
Why

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#47:1:B>
I no the here 's something because the girl grew up in Manila studied in Manila and

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#48:1:A>
And then

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#49:1:B>
And she 's from Bohol I think

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#50:1:A>
Uh I see

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#51:1:B>
And then uh there was a gap

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#52:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#53:1:B>
Between uh as she grew <{> <[> older </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#54:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#55:1:B>
You know there was a you know there was a gap uh between them and then finally before the girl left

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#56:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#57:1:B>
Uh <,,> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#58:1:A>
What happened to the girl <,> she grew up

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#60:1:B>
<{> <[> You know </[> 

 <$A>

<[> Why was the </[> </{> relationship strained

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#62:1:B>
I really I I I think you really need to <{1> <[1> read </[1> so that you can really understand because if I 'm going to tell <{2> <[2> you all these things it 's </[2> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#63:1:A>
<[1> To read it </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#65:1:A>
<[2> Explain things to me </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#66:1:A>
Okay what about Youngblood Two

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#67:1:B>
What about <{> <[> Youngblood Two </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#68:1:A>
<[> You 've read it </[> </{> already

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#69:1:B>
Yeah some are nice some are not really that nice

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#70:1:A>
<{> <[> But it 's okay </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#71:1:B>
<[> You were talking </[> </{> about gender <.> sensivity </.> sensitivity <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#72:1:A>
A while ago

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#73:1:B>
A while ago

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#74:1:A>
No uh yeah yeah yeah yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#75:1:B>
I read an article about uh about gender that 's <{> <[> not </[> really <.> re </.> related to what you 're <.> sa </.> you were saying a while ago

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#76:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> okay

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#78:1:B>
It 's about uh <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#79:1:B>
Do you believe that guys are really good in math

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#80:1:A>
I I I I I think generally guys are good in math I mean they 're better off than girls when it comes to math
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#82:1:A>
But for say for the for the arts and the languages I think girls are far better <{> <[> than guys </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#83:1:B>
<[> You really </[> </{> believe or

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#84:1:A>
I guess I mean that 's an observation

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#85:1:B>
That 's an <{> <[> observation </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#86:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> why

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#88:1:B>
Because we were discussing a while ago in our class uh last time in our class we were discussing about <O> cough </O> uh guys are really better in mathematics <{> <[> than girls </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#89:1:A>
<[> Are they </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#90:1:B>
There are researches <{> <[> made </[> and we were discussing why 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#91:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#93:1:A>
Why why

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#95:1:B>
Uhm <,> the thing uh the reason that we have was that uhm guys are really better in mathematics perhaps because of our culture
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#96:1:B>
Because <{1> <[1> before </[1> remember before uh <{2> <[2> time </[2> of Plato <{3> <[3> and Socrates </[3> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#97:1:A>
<[1> Why </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#98:1:A>
<[2> I mean </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#99:1:A>
<[3> So you 're you 're speaking </[3> </{3> about uh so it 's not not not just the Philippine culture <&> break in the recording </&> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#101:1:B>
International <{> <[> research </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#102:1:A>
<[> <indig> Ano </indig> okay </[> </{> yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#104:1:B>
It was really known and there <{> <[> are so </[> many researches that shows you know

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#105:1:A>
<[> And then </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#106:1:A>
And why is that <{> <[> regarding Plato and </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#107:1:B>
<[> Researches that show </[> </{> uh if you can remember uh those uh philosophers before <,> they were allowed to you know only guys were allowed to study mathematics <{> <[> remember </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#108:1:A>
<[> Uh </[> </{> uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#110:1:B>
So girls are not allowed and then we were saying

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#111:1:A>
They were not allowed to study <{1> <[1> mathematics nor </[1> were they allowed to neither were they allowed to study <{2> <[2> yeah </[2> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#112:1:B>
<[1> Yeah because </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#113:1:B>
<[2> Because </[2> </{2> they 're they were second class <{> <[> creatures </[> 
 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#114:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#116:1:A>
Denizens <O> laughter </O> okay 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#118:1:B>
Critters <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#119:1:A>
Okay

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#120:1:B>
No uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#121:1:A>
And then

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#122:1:B>
And then we were saying that what we have now although we are always saying that there 's equality between you know men and women what we have is the residual effect of that chauvinistic culture <{1> <[1> handed now </[1> to <{2> <[2> our culture </[2> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#123:1:A>
<[1> Uh really </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#125:1:A>
<[2> Handed down </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#126:1:A>
And then

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#127:1:B>
But there are no researches that prove that the factors but they are just assumptions that we are saying <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> because all all the researches are saying perhaps guys are really good in mathematics but the question of why <{2> <[2> was not </[2> <O> cough </O> explored 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#128:1:A>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#130:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#132:1:A>
I was thinking of a <{> <[> <,> </[> more biological reason for that 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#133:1:B>
<[> What do you think </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#135:1:B>
Biological reason

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#136:1:A>
Like perhaps what what part of the brain functions uh for math <.> wha </.> uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#137:1:B>
Left

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#138:1:A>
Yeah left okay 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#139:1:A>
Perhaps uh the left part of the brain of the guys work better

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#140:1:B>
But if <{> <[> you </[> can

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#141:1:A>
<[> Or </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#142:1:B>
To think that <{1> <[1> there are </[1> also girls who are <{2> <[2> really excelling </[2> in mathematics

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#143:1:A>
<[1> Than girls </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#144:1:A>
<[2> Uh yeah yeah </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#145:1:A>
But generally it 's the guys who excel in <{> <[> math right </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#146:1:B>
<[> Because that </[> </{> was our culture before 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#147:1:A>
Uh <{> <[> okay </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#148:1:B>
<[> <indig> Di ba </indig> </[> </{> like engineering are only for guys <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> <indig> Di ba </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#151:1:B>
<{2> <[2> So arts </[2> are only for girls 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#149:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#152:1:A>
<[2> But </[2> </{2> why do you think girls generally succeed in the languages than guys in languages rather than guys
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#154:1:A>
I mean <,> do you owe that to culture also

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#155:1:B>
Perhaps because <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> language is <,> <{2> <[2> in a sense a weaker </[2> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#156:1:A>
<[1> Not really </[1> </{1> <O> chuckle </O> <[2> like like </[2> </{2> girls

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#159:1:B>
Weak

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#160:1:A>
Weak what

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#161:1:B>
A weaker

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#162:1:A>
A weaker

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#163:1:B>
Uh a weaker science unlike math it 's a hard <{> <[> science </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#164:1:A>
<[> So it needs </[> </{> analysis
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#166:1:A>
And language doesn't

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#167:1:B>
Even psychology <indig> di ba </indig> 



<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#> We don't see <{> <[> guys in </[> psychology


 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#168:1:A>
<[> Women psychologists </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#169:1:A>
Uh really but but the proponents but much most of the proponents in psychology are

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#170:1:B>
Nowadays but before

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#171:1:A>
Like <{> <[> Sigmund Freud </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#172:1:B>
<[> Most of them </[> </{> are girls

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#173:1:A>
Yeah really
 I never thought of that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#175:1:B>
That 's why in psychology because it 's uh nowadays uh they are already promoting <{> <[> in </[> school 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#176:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> yeah but languages languages why or arts
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#180:1:A>
Isn't uh girls uh go for arts more than guys do

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#181:1:B>
I don't know I don't think so 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#182:1:A>
Or or <{> <[> the number 's </[> just equal

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#185:1:B>
<[> Because in </[> </{> architecture classes <indig> di ba </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#186:1:A>
There are more girls than <{> <[> guys </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#187:1:B>
<[> There are </[> </{> more girls uh there are more guys <{> <[> <,> </[> I think you can see and architecture is an art an art form

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#188:1:A>
<[> Uh yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#190:1:A>
Uh oh yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#191:1:B>
So it doesn't really follow but come to think uh there are only few girls in architecture classes right <{1> <[1> why </[1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#194:1:B>
Because of our culture <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#196:1:B>
Because we are saying that architecture is only for guys <indig> di ba </indig> 
 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#192:1:A>
Yeah <[1> yeah </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#195:1:A>
<[2> Because our culture dictates </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#197:1:A>
Oh yeah
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#198:1:A>
I took that up with uh my class last summer when I taught So-An sociology and anthropology
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#199:1:A>
And that 's it we were discussing about what professions uh uh in what professions do guys usually dominate and what professions do girls usually dominate
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#201:1:A>
And that 's it like what professions do girls usually dominate
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#202:1:A>
These are teaching <{> <[> <,> </[> the teaching profession nursing 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#203:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#206:1:B>
Nursing

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#207:1:A>
Like most of our nurses are <,> girls most of our teachers are girls what else
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#209:1:A>
And I I I I I even pointed out to them that I had a classmate in college before who took up education and like his friends were trying to tease him about it why why are you taking up education <{> <[> are you gay </[> or something
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#212:1:A>
Something like things like that



<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#> If you also take up nursing and you 're a guy like hey are you gay or something because our culture dictates that this profession is only for girls and this profession only for guys yeah 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#210:1:B>
<[> Yeah that 's true </[> </{> that 's true

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#215:1:A>
Engineering
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#216:1:A>
You know there 's this anecdote about what was that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#217:1:A>
Uh a boy and his father meeting an accident and the <.> fa </.> uh the father 's boy what was that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#219:1:A>
And the boy and his father meeting an accident and the father uh a vehicular accident at that and then the father died on the spot
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#220:1:A>
So uh the people who witnessed the accident uh brought the kid or the boy to the hospital
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#221:1:A>
And when the boy <.> rea </.> and when they reached the hospital they called for a surgeon
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#222:1:A>
And when the surgeon arrived she exclaimed oh I couldn't I couldn't operate on this boy 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#223:1:A>
And then they were asked why
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#224:1:A>
And then the surgeon said 'cause he 's my son

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#225:1:B>
<O> chuckle </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#226:1:A>
So who 's the surgeon

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#227:1:B>
The what the mother

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#228:1:A>
The mother
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#229:1:A>
And what most of my students said oh perhaps the the father who died in the accident was just the foster father and things like that because usually we have this notion that surgeons are male or males or guys yeah 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#230:1:B>
<O> chuckle </O> Like in the story of one of our teachers last time
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#233:1:B>
Uhm in a mathematics class <O> cough </O> he gave uh examples of Maria painted the room <O> cough </O> twice as much as

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#234:1:A>
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#235:1:B>
You know the usual problem in mathematics and then all of the students are you know <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> reacting like there 's something wrong
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#239:1:B>
We cannot solve the problem because <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> there 's something wrong in the problem because Maria doesn't really paint
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#242:1:B>
I mean the usual thing 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#236:1:A>
<[1> What </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#237:1:A>
Reacted
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#240:1:A>
<[2> Why </[2> </{2> uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#244:1:B>
Maria don't paint <{> <[> Maria </[> cooks <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#245:1:A>
<[> Okay </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#247:1:A>
So if the problem was stated that Maria cooked more recipes than whatever or went to market

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#248:1:B>
She doesn't paint <{1> <[1> she doesn't paint </[1> she doesn't you know do carpentries <{2> <[2> like </[2> some old culture <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#249:1:A>
<[1> She doesn't paint </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#251:1:A>
<[2> Okay </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#253:1:A>
Yeah or like Plato what Plato doing the laundry <O> laughter </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#254:1:B>
I don't know if it was Plato or Socrates <{> <[> <,> </[> who who had eight female teachers I think 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#255:1:A>
<[> Who </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#257:1:A>
Eight female teachers
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#258:1:A>
And then what was the implication

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#260:1:B>
But it was not even mentioned in the articles

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#261:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#262:1:B>
Why because men are not really that significant before

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#263:1:A>
Women

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#264:1:B>
Uh I 'm yeah I mean women

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#265:1:A>
Women are really not not that significant before yeah
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#267:1:A>
How would you attribute that to what would you attribute that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#269:1:A>
Like women weren't really that significant because <,> weren't really that significant because <,> how did that originate
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#270:1:A>
Do you know

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#271:1:B>
Uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#272:1:A>
Like we we were born we grew up in a patriarchal society wherein boys rule over girls
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#273:1:A>
Why

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#274:1:B>
Perhaps perhaps it can be traced back uh to activities of the society before ancient society

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#276:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#277:1:B>
Uh <,> where <,> guys are the rulers

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#278:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#279:1:B>
But you see Cleopatra

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#280:1:A>
Oh yeah Cleopatra but was she a ruler

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#282:1:B>
Was she a ruler

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#283:1:A>
Was she a ruler

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#284:1:B>
Because usually uhm girls are <,> you know on their emotional side

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#285:1:A>
Yeah <,> is that uh scientifically proven like girls are more emotional and guys more logical <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#287:1:B>
I read an article about that uh I 'm not convinced

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#288:1:A>
Yeah <{> <[> it 's because </[> you know uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#289:1:B>
<[> You know </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#290:1:B>
It depends upon the culture where you 're growing it depends upon the environment you know

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#292:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#293:1:B>
The environment shapes you <indig> di ba </indig> <{> <[> so </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#295:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> because in our R S class before we had this hand-out no not <.> hand </.> it was really a book it was compiled
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#298:1:A>
The the the articles there were uh compiled by Fr Yatco and then yeah he <.> whe </.> when we went into the topic of marriage of marriage uh that 's it he mentioned that uh why should men and women be what <,> understand each other
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#299:1:A>
Then we he he enumerated the things that men should understand in woman women and women should understand in men like men are basically what <,> silent that they don't talk much

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#302:1:B>
Oh yeah that 's true

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#303:1:A>
Yeah <{> <[> is that </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#304:1:B>
<[> Women </[> </{> talk much

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#305:1:A>
Women talk much do they

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#307:1:B>
Oh yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#308:1:A>
I guess so
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#309:1:A>
My Mom and Dad are like that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#310:1:A>
My Mom talks more than my Dad does

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#311:1:B>
They nag more often <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#312:1:A>
Mothers nag more often obviously
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#313:1:A>
Okay what else
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#314:1:A>
What 's the difference between men and women

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#315:1:B>
The thing that we you were saying a while ago <{> <[> <,> </[> the thing that you were asking I mean about gender what was that 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#316:1:A>
<[> What </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#319:1:A>
Gender

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#320:1:B>
Yeah <.> socializa </.> uh there are words that you know

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#321:1:A>
Uh yeah that uh like there 's this study that uh showing that gender defines what <,> social language
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#322:1:A>
Is that is that the term or something
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#323:1:A>
That uh men have <.> diffe </.> have a different language quote unquote from women
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#324:1:A>
Do you believe in that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#325:1:B>
Yeah perhaps perhaps <{> <[> like I have </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#326:1:A>
<[> Like men </[> </{> speak in different language

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-064#327:1:B>
Yeah because like like us <{> <[> we </[> cannot talk about <,> I mean private things like

 </I>
