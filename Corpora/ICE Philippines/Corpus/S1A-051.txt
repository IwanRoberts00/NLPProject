<I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#1:1:A>
I suppose so I suppose so <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#3:1:A>
We have no choice <O> laughter </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#4:1:B>
Hamburg is not being represented

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#5:1:A>
Yes it is in north of Germany

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#6:1:B>
Very near Denmark isn't it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#7:1:A>
Very near uh yes Denmark uh the uh how do you call that <,> uh <.> Scandi </.> Scandinavian countries
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#8:1:A>
Yes I 've been there twice so when I was there <,,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#9:1:B>
I suppose you 've been to Heidelberg

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#10:1:A>
I was there a year ago

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#11:1:B>
It 's a beautiful city

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#12:1:A>
Well it 's a it 's a university town huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#13:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#14:1:A>
It 's a <.> universi </.> <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#15:1:A>
How about the the University of Leeds
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#16:1:A>
Is that is Leeds supposed to be a town or

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#17:1:B>
Well Leeds used to be an industrial town they produced wool <{> <[> <,> </[> textiles and the university was built because of the woolen industry

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#18:1:A>
<[> Uh uhm </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#20:1:A>
Oh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#21:1:B>
Yes then philosophy evolved and philosophy and literature

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#22:1:A>
I heard from uh Vic Brias that uh the the author of a of our book Alistair Macintyre

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#23:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#24:1:A>
He 's supposed to have taught in the University of Leeds

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#25:1:B>
I 've no idea

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#26:1:A>
They told me once <,> yes

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#27:1:B>
Probably <,> probably before I was there

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#28:1:A>
How 'd you find that book of uh Macintyre

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#30:1:B>
It 's good although I had to get used to the language <{> <[> <,> </[> uh it 's not Anglo-American so it takes getting used to


 <$A> 


<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#> <[> It 's very </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#31:1:A>
I uh my comment is that uh I think Macintyre is uh getting into a problematic into that problematic of uh what we call <mention> postmodernism </mention> like that of <unclear> 1 word </unclear> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#32:1:B>
I don't know anything about <unclear> 1 word </unclear> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#33:1:A>
Uh-huh <,> postmodernism

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#34:1:B>
Postmodernism uh although I have heard people mentioning the word but I 've never really <unclear> word </unclear> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#35:1:A>
Let me see let me see
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#36:1:A>
Let me recall how Macintyre gets into this problem
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#37:1:A>
Uh based on this book <mention> After Virtue </mention> that very title <mention> After Virtue </mention> I think it 's postmodernist because <mention> virtue </mention> you know <mention> After Virtue </mention> what uh it it it gets you into thinking about the the the phase <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#38:1:A>
I think the cultural phase in which <,> something of the past <,> is uh going through a threshold <,> being questioned <,> being transformed and uh precisely at the point where you don't yet know exactly what the <,> what it is that it 's going to be transformed into <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#39:1:A>
Now it doesn't uh <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#40:1:B>
Well so far somebody told me I 'm not really sure about this you have to correct me then
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#42:1:B>
Some people say that postmodernism is sort of a critique of all forms of meta-narrative something <{> <[> <,> </[> it 's anti-foundationalist <,> uh I 'm not really sure uh I may be talking my head off

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#43:1:A>
Yes uh <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#44:1:A>
Maybe if we we could say it is anti uhm <,> anti-modernism

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#45:1:B>
Uhm of course that begs the question of what is modernism

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#46:1:A>
It 's a critique of a of the modern spirit and so again the question of uh what is the modern spirit isn't it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#47:1:B>
Is it also a going back to the classical <unclear> 1 word </unclear> it 's not

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#48:1:A>
It 's not <{> <[> it 's not </[> a going back

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#49:1:B>
<[> It 's not </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#50:1:A>
It 's a moving on it 's a <,> it 's going forward <,> without having to I hope without having to lose the heritage of the past
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#51:1:A>
Because for example this uh book of Macintyre while it is it is speaking of something <mention> After Virtue </mention> is contextualizing itself within history isn't it <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#52:1:A>
There 's a great deal of of <.> his </.> history in uh Macintyre <,,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#53:1:B>
Well <,> I have to you know think about that

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#54:1:A>
You think about it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#55:1:A>
There is however a kind of post-modernism which is uh also anti-history
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#56:1:A>
An example will be uhm will be somebody who is Nietzschean who is radically <,> negativist <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#57:1:B>
Uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#58:1:A>
So

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#59:1:B>
Whose <.> postmoder </.> postmodernism could be a sort of umbrella term for a lot of things but they could share certain assumptions
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#60:1:B>
Is it like that

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#61:1:A>
Including that <,> but generally it is uhm <,> it is it has a historical dimension because uh we are supposed to be going through through a stage <,> a stage in history in which we are no longer we no longer belong to the modern age
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#62:1:A>
In other words the modern age is past in the same way that there was a time when the medieval age was uh was past <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#63:1:A>
And uh we are moving into a new epoch
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#64:1:A>
We don't have a name for it yet so we call it <mention> post-modern </mention> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#65:1:B>
So what characterizes this as you as you say it new epoch

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#66:1:A>
At this point of the game uh the general <.> charac </.> character of this epoch is one of critique the critique of the immediate past <,,> <O> noise </O> 

 <$B> 


<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#> I see

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#68:1:A>
So there 's something new in <,> I I think post-modernism is uh is optimistic about about the future that there 's something new in the offing <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#69:1:A>
And you can see that even politically because uh everywhere in the world something 's going on right <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#70:1:A>
Changes right and left <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#71:1:A>
These are no longer the same as before
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#72:1:A>
So new time is a new epoch
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#73:1:A>
Don't you feel that way <,,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#74:1:B>
No <,> no not really

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#75:1:A>
Not really <&> break in recording </&> <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#76:1:A>
Are you enjoying your classes <,,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#77:1:B>
Yes <,> oh I enjoy the the the graduate class

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#78:1:A>
The graduate class I see <,> I see <,,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#79:1:B>
Hey I hear you have plans to introduce computerized logic teaching <{> <[> in La Salle </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#80:1:A>
<[> Uh uhm </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#82:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#83:1:B>
And so that will relieve the teachers to <,> to discuss to discourse more on the philosophical issues involved in logic 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#84:1:A>
Uh uhm yeah
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#85:1:A>
When you come back I think uh we should uh think along those lines
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#86:1:A>
Design courses and uh <,> 'cause I have done this tradition also with <unclear> word </unclear> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#87:1:B>
'Cause when I was in Leeds they they they had the they had this logic interaction with with computers and it 's it 's
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#88:1:B>
The computer really teaches you how to because if you make some for example if you <?> devise </?> something wrong the computer will give you a feedback it 'll say it 's wrong like that

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#89:1:A>
Uhm uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#90:1:B>
It 's very good

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#91:1:A>
Uhm we don't have that yet here

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#92:1:B>
I know

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#93:1:A>
You know it 's Raymond 's birthday also

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#94:1:B>
Yes I heard <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#95:1:B>
So when is the <,>

But the food is here right

It 's very tiring

 <$A>

How would you like teaching for the first term graduate school <,> logic

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#132:1:B>
Oh I 'll <,> I 'll I 'll see about that yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#133:1:A>

Did you know that both of you were coming this year

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#164:1:B>
No I had no idea

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#165:1:A>
No idea

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#166:1:B>
Uh yeah I only knew it when I came in I think that was the Friday before the start of term

 <$A>

How long have you been in been there <,> five years or so

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#182:1:B>
Four and a half

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#183:1:A>
Four and a half and Keith was about the same time

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#184:1:B>
I think a bit a bit longer five or <{> <[> seven </[> years <,> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#185:1:A>
<[> Six </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#186:1:B>
There is a in England there is a time limit for the P H D

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#187:1:A>
Oh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#188:1:B>
It 's four years

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#189:1:A>
I see

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#190:1:B>
If you 're doing full time four years is the maximum time limit
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#191:1:B>
I did it in four and a half because they calculated because I stopped for for a few months

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#192:1:A>
And if you don't make it for four years

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#193:1:B>
You 're considered <unclear> words </unclear> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#194:1:A>
I see

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#195:1:B>
You fail yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#196:1:A>
And then uh you don't have an M A there right

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#197:1:B>
There is but <,> I think it is because of their educational system because their undergraduate is already very geared towards research 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#198:1:B>
So after you finish your undergraduate you can proceed if you have excellent grades you can go straight away to P H D because in P H D in P H D in England we don't have we don't attend any classes we just do research
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#200:1:B>
We <{> <[> don't have </[> class

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#201:1:A>
<[> Uh uhm </[> </{> uh uhm how nice <,,> <{> <[> so </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#203:1:B>
<[> Only </[> </{> it was quite disorienting in the first because I am not very much <,> because I I was not part of that system so at first I was a bit disoriented

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#204:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#205:1:B>
But in the second year I slowly

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#206:1:A>
Yes <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#207:1:A>

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#208:1:B>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#209:1:B>
Well if they speak with a Yorkshire accent you wouldn't know what they 're talking about

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-051#214:1:B>
Well it 's not native <,> it 's <.> Eng </.> <,> it 's sort of English with a very thick very very strong
