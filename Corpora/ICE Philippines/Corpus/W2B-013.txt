<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#3:1>
THE INTERNATIONAL Press Institute is meeting in Manila for the
first time in its 47-year history, bringing together the editors and
publishers of leading newspapers from all over the world.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#4:1>
Its members represent mainly newspapers in democracies, with the
editors sharing similar political values. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#5:1>
They are here to contemplate the fate of the freedom of the press
in a globalized scale and the perils facing journalists covering news in
democracies as well as in less tolerant and less participatory political
systems. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#6:1>
The choice of Manila as a venue of the conference is significant.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#7:1>
The Philippines is one of the few spots in Asia where freedom of the
press is practiced with little inhibition and in the way freedom is
understood by the established industrial democracies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#8:1>
They understand press freedom without adjectives.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#9:1>
Unlike other international forums where they torment the meaning of
<mention> political freedom </mention> with qualifications such as <mention>
&ldquo; Asian values, &rdquo; </mention> this group of editors and publishers
are not bogged down in nit-picking over meanings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#10:1>
When they talk about freedom, they mean publication of newspapers
without government licenses and pre-censorship ( overt or covert), a judicial
system that is imbued with a liberal outlook in interpreting libel laws and
political liberties, where journalists are not jailed for their political
views and where the political environment allows untrammeled access to
sources of information. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#11:1>
Because journalists cover turbulent events both in politically
tolerant and intolerant political systems, one of the IPI 's top concerns is
the physical risks faced by journalists and the killing of journalists in
line of duty. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#12:1>
This is the context against which the IPI reported that each
year, 60 to 80 journalists are killed all over the world.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#13:1>
During the past five years, 236 journalists were killed in Asia, 12
of which were in the Philippines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#14:1>
The IPI noted that journalists are increasingly being murdered
because of critical reporting about people involved in crimes, not
necessarily critical reporting about governments. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#15:1>
The world has never been free of trouble spots and turbulent
events that include wars and rebellions in which journalists are killed in
the cross-fire with nothing to protect them except their ID that is worthless
compared with badges of the Red Cross and paramedics which are more respected
by belligerents than press cards. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#16:1>
Recently, a number of journalists were killed in Cambodia,
Bosnia, Algeria and in Africa which is often visited by political turbulence.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#17:1>
The deaths there are traditional risks for journalists.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#18:1>
The IPI has raised its concerns over this. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#19:1>
But what alarms the IPI is that more journalists die in the hands
of drug lords, organized criminals and violent individuals than at the hands
of murderous governments.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#20:1>
There is growing concern that governments are less able to protect
journalists from the lawless and to mobilize their law enforcement apparatus
to bring murderers to justice. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#21:1>
This is the case with the murder of 12 Filipino journalists
during the past five years, including that of the <mention> People 's Tonight
</mention> news editor Danny Hernandez.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#22:1>
Only four of the 12 cases have been put to trial, and are still
dragging in the courts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#23:1>
In Cambodia, where the drug lords have a running battle with the
governments, journalists are regular victims and fair game to political
assassination. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#24:1>
<h> <bold> Breakdown of law </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#25:1>
The rise in the victimization of journalists reflects the
breakdown of law enforcement in societies where incidence of killings of
journalists is high. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#26:1>
In the past, the IPI 's main concern was to act as a lobby group
to seek freedom of journalists who were jailed by intolerant and
authoritarian regimes.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#27:1>
Sometimes they succeeded in securing release of journalists from
detention, as was the case of the IPI interventions of journalists jailed by
the Marcos martial law regime. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#28:1>
Sometimes the intervention failed.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#29:1>
In any case, the concern was focused on governments rather than on
outlaw groups and criminal organizations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#30:1>
To be sure, the post-Marcos administrations have not jailed any
journalists for their reporting and commentaries.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#31:1>
In particular, the Ramos administration has not used its powers to
curb press freedom, although it is not above manipulating journalists and
managing the news. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#32:1>
The press can cope with manipulation and news management, but it
is extremely vulnerable to assassinations by criminals in societies with
ineffectual judicial and law enforcement systems like that in the
Philippines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#33:1>
Additionally, the press cannot truly be free if judicial systems
are prone to decide against journalists who are sued by governments for
&ldquo; offensive &rdquo; political and economic reporting, as in Singapore
where the government always wins cases against journalists and judges trigger
happy in imposing fines and damages on them. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#34:1>
<h> <bold> Evading issue </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#35:1>
Thus, when President Ramos addressed the IPI conference, he
evaded the issue over which the IPI has expressed its concerns.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#36:1>
Rather, he engaged in worthless platitudes and diversionary chatter.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#37:1>
While he described the journalists as <mention> &ldquo;
endangered species &rdquo; </mention> - - which is an understatement--he
switched attention to the function of the press to report economic crisis
with more clarity and authoritative explanation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#38:1>
The question of the importance of the press in illuminating
economic, social and political problems is a settled one.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#39:1>
That notion of responsibility is accepted by both the press and
governments in democratic societies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#40:1>
While the press performance in this area is sometimes spotty,
there is at least a continuing correction on the part of the media on their
shortcomings.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#41:1>
But in the case of press members being murdered by criminals with
governments unable to bring them to trial, the journalists will just have to
live with the reality that they have to fend for themselves. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#42:1>
Neither the IPI nor governments can help them.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#43:1>
The picture is that the press, no matter what all those platitudes on
press freedom proclaim, is a high-risk occupation that has to cope with
governments and criminals. </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#45:2>
<h> <bold> Dreams that Rizal wrote of </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#46:2>
<bold> Ambeth R. Ocampo </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#47:2>
MY fame ( or should I say notoriety) in academic circles stems
from a controversial lecture I read in 1989 on Rizal 's dreams.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#48:2>
In my own clumsy way, I tried to make sense of the dreams Rizal
recorded in his diaries and letters and attempted to push the parameters of
knowledge a bit further.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#49:2>
However, they say that a little knowledge is dangerous and I am a
case in point. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#50:2>
I was terribly mistaken in that ( in)famous lecture, so seven
years later I rewrote the lecture and tested it on both the Philippine
Psychiatric Association and the Philippine Psychological Association in order
to redeem myself.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#51:2>
Rizal 's dreams made me reflect on Rizal, Freud and the Failure of
Psycho-History. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#52:2>
When I began work on Rizal, everyone was very discouraging
because it was believed that there was nothing new in Rizal studies, that
everything about him had been covered by other scholars before.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#53:2>
Well, I found and published the drafts of Rizal 's third and
unpublished novel as well as other minor details that led one of my editors
to describe my work as scraping the bottom of the Rizal barrel for <indig>
<it> tutong sa kaldero </it> </indig> <&> ( trans. rice sticking to the pot)
</&> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#54:2>
One of the ways I sought to make sense of Rizal was to look into his
diaries, letters and assorted writings--all 25 published volumes--in search
of Rizal 's dreams. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#55:2>
The little I remembered of my Psychology 100 class in college was
that dreams occur at night when the conscious gives way to the unconscious,
thus insecurities and fears kept from other people during the day plague
dreamers in their sleep.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#56:2>
Rizal was no exception, and we are fortunate that he recorded at
least 11 dreams in his letters and journals.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#57:2>
These were noted down in different places and different times from 21
to 29 years old.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#58:2>
Skeptical historians said these dreams are irrelevant, but then in my
amateur way I would consider them important in our study of Rizal because
they bothered him enough to be recorded. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#59:2>
A closer look at these dreams reveals psychic or precognitive
ability.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#60:2>
Undoubtedly psychic from childhood, Rizal remembers the time when as
a freshman medical student at the University of Santo Tomas he dreamed that
he was taking an exam when that was to take place a few days later, he woke
up remembering the exam questions in his dream but didn't give it a thought.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#61:2>
When he finally sat for the exam he was surprised and delighted to
discover that the questions he saw in his dream were the very same ones in
the actual exam. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#62:2>
Naturally, he related this to his elder brother Paciano, who it
seems was also psychic because one night after <indig> <it> Simbang Gabi
</it> </indig> Rizal related the dreams he was having about the family going
through a period of trouble ( <indig> <it> kaguluhan </it> </indig> ) but he
could not make out or tell whether the family would lose or gain from this
&ldquo; trouble. &rdquo;

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#63:2>
Paciano who wrote Rizal in 1883 was reminded of this dream and
related that he had similar dreams, but unlike Rizal 's which were vague,
Paciano 's dreams were clear as to the outcome being misfortune and hardship
the Rizals would face in the future.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#64:2>
He even added: <quote> &ldquo; . ...I 'm not much of a believer in
dreams that occur in the darkness of sleep, I cannot believe in it although
all this can happen. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#65:2>
Historians now know that misfortune did befall the Rizal family:
Eviction from Calamba, persecution and the death of their brother Jose. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#66:2>
While Rizal was in Europe he surely heard of the advances in
psychology brought out by Sigmund Freud 's then revolutionary theories and
his pioneering work in dream analysis.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#67:2>
Hence, Rizal in his time, was caught between a psychological and
superstitious belief in dreams.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#68:2>
Rizal outwardly scoffed and actually laughed at his own dreams, but
in his diaries and letters to close friends he related the dreams which
frightened him.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#69:2>
He left us, in his diaries and letters, some dreams that troubled him
enough he put them down on paper.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#70:2>
These dreams must have been important. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#71:2>
Very early on, Rizal had this consciousness of death and he
believed he would not reach the age of 30.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#72:2>
He says in a letter to Paciano that dreams always regulated his
conduct <indig> <it> [ ang aking mga panaginip ay siya na lamang nagaayos ng
aking mga hakbang] </it> </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#73:2>
From the time Rizal left for Europe in 1892 till he wrote his
novels <mention> <foreign> &ldquo; Noli Me Tangere &rdquo; </foreign>
</mention> and <mention> <foreign> &ldquo; El Filibusterismo &rdquo;
</foreign> </mention> he was battling with destiny.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#74:2>
He had an inkling he would die young, and only a sensitive trained
psychologist or psychiatrist will probably determine whether Rizal was able
to control his precognitive gifts or not.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#75:2>
How, for example, can we explain two sealed letters he left with a
Portuguese friend in Hong Kong in 1892 to be opened after his death?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#76:2>
These letters addressed to his family and the Filipino people state
that he is giving his life for his country or words to that effect.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#77:2>
What do we make of these letters?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#78:2>
Was he vain?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#79:2>
Did he have an exaggerated view of his importance?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#80:2>
Perhaps he had an eye to posterity?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#81:2>
Fact is that he came to terms with destiny and took it by the horns.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#85:3>
When I saw the front-page photos of the President and the tourism
secretary taking a raft down a raging river in Cagayan and hiking up to the
crater of Pinatubo, I couldn't help but think of all the travel accounts on
the Philippines that I have read over the years.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#86:3>
Ninth century Chinese travelers described pre-colonial Filipinos as
<mention> &ldquo; barbarians. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#87:3>
Antonio Pigafetta, the chronicler of the Magellan expedition, was
fascinated by penis implements and asked to see these things.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#88:3>
However, the Filipino <foreign> machos </foreign> suddenly turned
modest.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#89:3>
Perhaps they were pulling Pigafetta 's leg and historians like myself
have never gotten the joke after five centuries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#90:3>
Alfred Marche in the 19th century took the first photograph of
the <foreign> sultan </foreign> of Sulu.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#91:3>
Josephine Craig, a schoolteacher in the early 20th century, tried to
define the distinct racial smell of Filipinos.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#92:3>
There are descriptions of Filipino character, the beauty of Mayon or
Taal or Filipino <foreign> <it> mestizas </it> </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#93:3>
There are accounts of food, drink, fiestas, cockfighting and <indig>
carabaos </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#94:3>
Most of these are foreign travel accounts on the Philippines and
the Filipinos.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#95:3>
Surely, it would be good to read a Filipino point of view, but then
writers like Pedro Paterno, Jose Rizal, Antonio Luna and Marcelo H. del Pilar
were too busy writing home from Europe to let their relatives know what it
was like to be abroad. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#96:3>
One of the projects I hope to complete in my lifetime will be a
compilation of travel writing by Filipinos.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#97:3>
As a historian, I have relied heavily on accounts of the Philippines
from foreign eyes.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#98:3>
Wouldn't it be fascinating to see the great capitals of the world -
London, Paris, Madrid, New York, etc. - from the eyes of Filipinos?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#99:3>
Wouldn't it be interesting to see how Filipinos looked at their own
country in the 19th century and contrast it with the views of foreign
tourists. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#100:3>
If I had another lifetime to waste on research, I would dig up
old travel brochures on the Philippines and try to see what was the selling
point of the Philippines before beaches and sex tours.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#101:3>
Zoilo Galang 's <mention> &ldquo; Encyclopedia of the Philippines,
&rdquo; </mention> mostly compiled in the 1930s and whose last edition was
printed in 1950, has some hard-sell tourist material that will make Dick
Gordon <&> Secretary of Tourism </&> squirm.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#102:3>
Sample this: <X>

I immediately associated this prewar blurb with dengue and the
Abu Sayyaf today. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#109:3>
The Philippine Tourist Bureau even had an exact figure for the
number of islands in the archipelago - 7,083 - while most brochures are vague
and estimate that we have 7,100 islands, more or less, depending on whether
you count at high tide or low tide.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-013#110:3>
The Philippines was described as a <quote> &ldquo; great jade
necklace across the throat of Asia...unspoiled vacation place...where winter
is unknown...where life flows easily and sweetly...where the polo season
lasts eight months...where countless contrasts greet the eye, amaze, astound
and intrigue the senses, <foreign> etc., etc. </foreign> &ldquo; </quote>

Now, that is what I call superlatives. </p> </I>
