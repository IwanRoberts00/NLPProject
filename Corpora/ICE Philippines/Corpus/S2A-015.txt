Tons of brick have been taken off his chest they 'll be replaced by a medal of gold and the Philippines has broken its drought in tennis via the men 's singles finals wherein Barrientos disposed of a tough and hard-fighting rookie in the men 's circuit <unclear> name </unclear> of Indonesia six three seven six 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#> There once again Barrientos falling down three five in the second set climbing back up six five and <unclear> name </unclear> forcing a tie break in that second set a long drawn-out affair but nonetheless Felix Barrientos prevailed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#3:1:A>

<&> missing words </&> Country Club lanes in Pasig site of the bowling competition of the sixteenth SEA Games
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#5:1:B>
This is the sixth and final day of bowling competition
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#6:1:B>
Ten bowls have already been handed out and my name is Butch Maniego 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#> Working with me this afternoon is a bowler a national team bowler who only began playing two years ago but she 's gone a long way since then
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#7:1:B>
This is Lyn Sembrano
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#8:1:B>
Good morning Lyn

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#9:1:C>
Yeah good morning Butch

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#10:1:B>
And uh Lyn was a member of the national team for this main competitions but uh she was not able to compete I believe here in this tournament but uh she 's here to provide her expert analysis and opinion of what 's transpiring here in the women 's Masters
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#11:1:B>
This is the fifteenth and final game
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#12:1:B>
<unclear> 2 words </unclear> will be bringing you flat to step ladder finals later on
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#13:1:B>
Right now Lyn how is the country doing as far as uh medals are concerned here in the bowling competition

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#14:1:C>
Yeah uh regarding the medal standing
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#15:1:C>
So far <{> <[> uh </[> we have won uh the for the silver medal on the doubles event

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#16:1:B>
<[> Yes </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#18:1:B>
Yes

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#19:1:C>
And uh a silver for the silver for the men 's we also have won in the grand in the all events for the men we have captured all the medals the gold the silver and the bronze
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#21:1:C>
And right now we 're hopeful that we can get at least a gold medal here because we have Arianne Cerde&ntilde;a and Liza Fernandez in the top three positions and for the men as far as the men 's are concerned we have the one two three four of which we can hopefully get into the step ladder later this afternoon

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#22:1:B>
Yes thank you very much Lyn
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#23:1:B>
So far here in uh women 's Masters where the top sixteen players in the all-events qualified as uh Lyn mentioned Liza Fernandez occupying the number one spot after fourteen after fourteen games
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#24:1:B>
This is the fifteenth and final game
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#25:1:B>
They played a round robin type of a match play in which uh the bowlers go head-to-head and the winners will get an additional ten pin if they uh beat their opponent in their head-to-head match-up but still what counts is the total number of pins garnered by the players after fifteen games
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#26:1:B>
<{> <[> Right Lyn </[> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#27:1:C>
<[> Yes uh uh </[> </{> Liza is leading way way ahead and the number two is so far Grace Young of Singapore and uh close behind down by just forty-one pins is Arianne Cerde&ntilde;a our Olympic gold medalist
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#28:1:C>
So Arianne always has a final kick and we hope that she gets into that number two slot
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#29:1:C>
Anyway uh what whoever is the number two or three gets a crack beating Liza Fernandez who 's our top qualifier bowling the last game

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#31:1:B>
Yes Lyn can you just explain to our audience right now how the step ladder format works for this uh women 's Masters competition of the sixteenth SEA Games

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#32:1:C>
Yeah based on total pin points Butch we get the one two and three
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#33:1:C>
The number rank number three and two battles for for one game only one game match
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#34:1:C>
And the winner of that goes to compete with the top qualifier who <.> gain </.> who has gained the top seed fifteen balls
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#35:1:C>
And with it is a knock-out game
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#36:1:C>
It 's the total pin point who gain
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#37:1:C>
You have to beat your opponent twice right
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#38:1:C>
<{> <[> To win the number two </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#39:1:B>
<[> So that </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#40:1:B>
Yes so so from what I understand the top qualifier only has to beat the challenger whoever she is only once to win the gold medal here in the women 's Masters event

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#41:1:C>
So far the Philippine team uh has prepared good mental preparation for this type of a game because we just had our mock SEA Game wherein all uhm good players from the local local from organizations competing against each other and so so far we have we landed on the one two and three
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#42:1:C>
We were placed under pressure
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#43:1:C>
Really

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#44:1:B>
So uh we can see that the Philippine Bowling Congress did everything they could to get uh all the players here in high gear
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#45:1:B>
We take a look at some of the previous winners so far already here in the women 's side of the bowling competition of the sixteenth SEA Games
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#46:1:B>
Earlier you saw the <w> ladies' </w> triples which was won by Indonesia and now the latest doubles won by Malaysia with the Philippine team coming in second and third

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#47:1:C>
Yes and one thing for sure Grace Young is really came here to to do her best because she 's a defending <.> champ </.> Masters champion of the last SEA Games

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#48:1:B>
Yes I believe uh in the previous game game number fourteen we saw a titanic struggle over lanes twenty-three and twenty-four between Liza Fernandez and Grace Young

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#49:1:C>
Yeah uhm actually Grace Young uh did a two hundred forty-six game and Liza Fernandez did a two hundred thirty-four
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#50:1:C>
So it was really a battle
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#51:1:C>
It was a battle of strikes not of spares

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#52:1:B>
Yes

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#53:1:C>
Arianne was so close behind with the two hundred forty-five game

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#54:1:B>
Exactly <&> break in the recording </&> <&> commercial break </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#55:1:B>
Open frame in the ninth uh uh <unclear> word </unclear> in the tenth uh going out on three straight strikes to H I N by one minute in the fourteenth game
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#56:1:B>
But now this is the fifteenth and final game and uh after this only the three top players will remain in the women 's Masters finals <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#57:1:B>
Yes so right now we will now be going over to lanes number fifteen and sixteen to witness close hand a match taking place between Liza Fernandez and Popy Tambis who had won the gold medal in the women 's singles earlier last week

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#58:1:C>
Yes actually right now lanes fifteen and sixteen on the first frame Liza made a strike and on the second frame she had a one down but was able to convert it and now Liza shot a double

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#60:1:B>
Yes a double in bowling is two strikes two straight strikes and Liza Fernandez who as we mentioned is leading the field going into the fifteenth game
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#61:1:B>
You saw her deliver a strike and this is her opponent in the match play division
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#62:1:B>
That 's Popy Tambis

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#63:1:C>
Uh while on another set of lanes Grace Young who is a contender for the top three position has only two spares and two splits and on another pair of lane wherein Arianne is <,> trying to make a run for it she has a strike and has split two spares

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#65:1:B>
Yes we 're trying to get the scores as of game fourteen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#66:1:B>
What we have here is a two uh game number thirteen which Liza Fernandez she 's she actually had the overnight lead uh Lyn
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#67:1:B>
The way I understand it Bong Revilla was number two coming into the final seven games
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#68:1:B>
But something has happened to Bong 's game and she 's right now at number four
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#69:1:B>
And I don't think she did so well in game fourteen

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#70:1:C>
Yeah actually Bong is having a tough time right now maybe perhaps because of the lane condition 'cause as of three frames she has already two open frames
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#71:1:C>
So it 's gonna be a little bit hard for her to get into the top three
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#72:1:C>
But in the meantime Liza Fernandez has really prepared well for this game
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#73:1:C>
She was a former flight stewardess and has really begged off from her work to prepare herself for the SEA Games

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#74:1:B>
So you can see the amount of dedication that has to go into the pursuit of excellence here in the sport of bowling Lyn

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#75:1:C>
Yes actually also Arianne has a slight knee injury but you can't see from her any injury at all
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#76:1:C>
So she has mentally blocked off that injury
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#77:1:C>
Actually we have uh the Philippine team has a court psychologist really to help you on your mental training because bowling is not only plain skill it 's also more on mental game mental training
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#78:1:C>
And we also have undergone some uh we have enrolled on <unclear> words </unclear> sport uh we went underwent training at Fit Center Philippines and we did some work-out

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#80:1:B>
I hope you 've seen Liza Fernandez getting her fourth strike in a row here in game number fifteen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#81:1:B>
It looks like she 's really bent on entering the step ladder final in the number one slot Lyn

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#82:1:C>
Yes as far as Arianne Cerde&ntilde;a is concerned she just made the wash out wash out means uh leaving six for the head team and was able to convert it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#83:1:C>
You can see her intensity right now because this is the last game this is go for it and go for broke and Arianne has that skill and that intensity <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#84:1:B>
Uh earlier you saw in blue Liza Kwan one of the more popular popular players I believe here in the Southeast Asian Games <{> <[> uh </[> bowling competition

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#85:1:C>
<[> Uh yes </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#86:1:C>
Yes actually Liza Kwan as of the world F I Q held in Singapore was a silver medalist
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#87:1:C>
Actually it was a big uh game for her
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#88:1:C>
It was just on the last game that she made a five two hundred game to enter into the top three
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#89:1:C>
And she was uh the only Asian to qualify on the top three positions 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#90:1:C>
And right now I think Liza made another strike for making it a five <?> dagger </?> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#91:1:B>
Yes that 's five straight strikes thrown by Liza Fernandez <,> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#92:1:C>
You can see Liza 's form right now
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#93:1:C>
She makes a five step delivery and really she hit a <?> Brooklyn </?> shot
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#94:1:C>
But you know in bowling when it really scores what counts whether it 's on the left side of the head pin or you hit the right what is important is you get a strike because it 's the last game Butch

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#95:1:B>
Yes and Liza Fernandez working on a probable two hundred eighty game if she manages to strike all the way out 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#> She needs five more strikes to accomplish the two eighty game

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#96:1:C>
As far as Bong 's game right now it 's really <,> tough for her because she just has one mark and has a split on the fourth frame and a possible spare but you know Butch she needs more than that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#97:1:C>
Probably a punch out which means a strike all the way probably <unclear> words </unclear> little to qualify <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#98:1:C>
Liza right now made a heavy hit and she makes a baby split that is a convertible split
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#99:1:C>
If she converts the split it 's going to be a very good game for her

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#101:1:B>
I believe she left the number three and ten pin standing now

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#102:1:C>
Yes Butch actually she would just aim for pin six which is supposed to be in the middle of those two pins and Liza can do it because of her mental preparation right now and intensity

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#103:1:B>
Yes Liza Fernandez uh
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#104:1:B>
It 's a little bit worrying because the R P women 's team so far has failed to deliver a single gold medal Lyn

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#105:1:C>
Uh yeah it was sort of a probably a sort of a not the right timing but then we had we have the line-up for it Butch

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#106:1:B>
Yeah

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#107:1:C>
We have Bong and uh Arianne Cerde&ntilde;a are very good uh combination for the doubles because Bong is a very experienced bowler twenty-one years actually in bowling and has so many records
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#108:1:C>
And Arianne Cerde&ntilde;a is still young but she is an Olympic medalist but you know breaks of the game that 's why they didn't make it for the doubles but they ran away with the silver
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#109:1:C>
And for the other contenders we just some had bad breaks of the game

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-015#110:1:B>
Yeah bowling is a game in which uh you may be the best player in the world but if for one day there is somebody better then you don't win

 </I>
