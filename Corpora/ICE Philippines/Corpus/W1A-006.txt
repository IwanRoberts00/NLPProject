<h> <bold> THE LINGO OF SHOWBIZ, THE TALK OF STARS: AN ANALYSIS OF THE
LANGUAGE OF <indig> PINOY </indig> MOVIE MAGAZINES </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#2:1>
By Paul Henson and Kathrine Tan

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#3:1>
<h> <bold> I. Background </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#4:1>
It is safe to say that movie magazines are, in themselves, part of
the culture of Philippine society.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#5:1>
One cannot call it an isolated minority as a cultural phenomenon as it
occupies a steady place in the lives of the ordinary Filipino just as the
soap operas, <indig> komiks </indig> , radio drama serials, and Tagalog
romance novels do.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#6:1>
Movie magazines persist and will remain to do so for as long as the
local film industry, with much the same strong following as these
publications, continue to churn out movies intended for the masses.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#7:1>
But why study popular culture?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#8:1>
Isagani R. Cruz ( 1979) provides a simple answer which encapsulates
the reason in its entirety.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#9:1>
To the question <quote> &ldquo; Why study popular culture? &rdquo;
</quote> -

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#10:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Because it is there. &rdquo; </quote> <X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#X11:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Such an answer may seem flippant, but in fact,
it is precise.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#X12:1>
The serious academic scholar studies popular culture because it is
his business to study reality, and popular culture forms a large part of
social, intellectual, and artistic reality. &rdquo; </quote> </p> </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#13:1>
Added to this, <quote> &ldquo; The sociologist...[and
consequently the sociolinguist] sees popular culture as a social phenomenon,
capable of being studied with standard sociological tools &rdquo; </quote> (
1979). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#14:1>
The language of the movie magazines shall prove to be a most
interesting point of study as its conventions would speak, to some extent, of
the language itself, of what could be termed a <mention> &ldquo;
sociocultural network &rdquo; </mention> : the readers, the writers, the
entertainment industry. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#15:1>
At a period wherein the Filipino language is undergoing serious
development, the examination of the language of movie magazines may prove
important for it remains to be a language domain ( though not a controlling
one).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#16:1>
As such, by identifying its state, one could bridge it with the other
domains so that Filipino could finally fulfill its purpose of being the
symbol of national unity. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#17:1>
<h> <bold> II. Scope of the Study </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#18:1>
This study is centered on the weekly published, Filipino language
movie magazines that cater to the C, D crowd.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#19:1>
It is focused mainly on the movie columns because these would have,
more or less, already developed a distinct writing style as compared to the
feature articles which are basically reportive.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#20:1>
Attention is given to the formation of words ( morphology) and the
way words are put together to form sentences ( syntax).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#21:1>
The study of semantics and styles of speech were purposely omitted
since they are subjective and more of evaluative, and would therefore,
require a lengthier discussion.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#22:1>
The purpose of this study is not to provide statistical data but
merely to provide a grasp of the culture of movie magazines in general. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#23:1>
<h> <bold> III. Significance of the Study </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#24:1>
The study takes to the writers and readers of the local movie
magazines as users of the Filipino language.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#25:1>
For a long time now, the intellectualization of the national language
has been ( and remains to be) a big concern.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#26:1>
And such is basically in response to the needs of the controlling
domains of language in our society, <quote> &ldquo; that is, the domains that
dictate what language to learn and aspire for ... those of government
administration, legislation, judiciary and law, business, commerce, industry,
science and technology, the professions, media and education &rdquo; </quote>
( Sibayan, 1991: p. 214). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#27:1>
But what about the language needs of the ordinary Filipino?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#28:1>
Sibayan ( 1991: p. 243) himself acknowledges the significance of a
mass based language: <X>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#X29:1>
<quote> &ldquo; A language may be intellectually modernized but if
it is possessed by only a tiny upper elite and has no mass base that
possesses a PM [ popularly modernized] version from which to draw future IM [
intellectually modernized] users, it will die. &rdquo; </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#30:1>
Thus, with the movie magazines as reflections of a mass-based
Filipino, the study aims to bring to awareness the state and possibly, the
needs, of a national language relating to the masses. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#31:1>
<h> <bold> IV. Methodology </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#32:1>
The data that were analyzed for this study were obtained from 10
different weekly published Filipino movie magazines.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#33:1>
The magazines were collected for a specific period of time, that is,
between the last week of February to the first week of March, 1997.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#34:1>
The following is the listing of the magazines:

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#35:1>
<indig> Artista </indig> Magazine. March 3, 1997.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#36:1>
<indig> ChikaChika </indig> . March 2, 1997.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#37:1>
Controversial Magazine. February 28, 1997.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#38:1>
Fame Movie Magazine. March 7, 1997.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#39:1>
Flash. March 6, 1997.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#40:1>
Intrigue. March 6, 1997.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#41:1>
<indig> Kislap </indig> . March 3, 1997.

Star Talk Movie Teen Magazine. March 7, 1997.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#44:1>
Super Teen Movie Magazine. March 2, 1997. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#45:1>
The columns were read and analyzed on the following questions:

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#46:1>
<h> A. Morphology </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#47:1>
a. How are words formed?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#48:1>
b. What sociolinguistic concepts/grammatical rules are employed in
the creation of words unique to movie magazines?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#49:1>
c. What processes are involved in the creation of slang words?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#50:1>
<h> B. Syntax </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#51:1>
a. How are sentences structured in movie magazines?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#52:1>
b. What grammatical conventions are used?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#53:1>
English or Filipino?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#54:1>
c. Do they form grammatically correct sentences?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#55:1>
d. Explain the process of code switching and borrowing.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#56:1>
What purpose do these serve?

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#57:1>
Instances of recurring conventions were taken note of and
analyzed for patterns. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#58:1>
<h> <bold> V. Findings and Results </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#59:1>
<h> <bold> A. Morphology </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#60:1>
<h> 1. Tenses. </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#61:1>
According to Consuelo J. Paz ( 1995: p. 14), <O> Long quotation in
Filipino </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#62:1>
This is very manifest in the morphology of movie magazines.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#63:1>
What is strikingly noticeable however is the manner ( and rampancy)
in which English borrowings are subjected to rules in Tagalog tenses. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#64:1>
Tagalog words are placed in the past tense by the addition of any
of the prefixes <indig> <it> nag- </it> </indig> , <indig> <it> na- </it>
</indig> or <indig> <it> i- </it> </indig> and/or the addition of suffixes
<indig> <it> an/han </it> </indig> or affixes <indig> <it> um/in </it>
</indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#65:1>
Notice how the following borrowings were placed in the past tense:
<O> Examples in Filipino </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#66:1>
Generally, Tagalog words are placed in the present tense by the
addition of <indig> <it> nag- </it> </indig> , <indig> <it> na- </it>
</indig> and by the reduplication of the first syllable of the word.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#67:1>
Otherwise, affixes <indig> <it> in/um </it> </indig> are added in the
middle.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#68:1>
Notice the following borrowings and how they were placed in the
present tense: <O> Examples in Filipino </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#69:1>
Tagalog words are placed in the future tense by the addition of
prefixes <indig> <it> mag- </it> </indig> , <indig> <it> ma- </it> </indig>
or <indig> <it> i- </it> </indig> and by the reduplication of the first
syllable of the word.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#70:1>
Notice the following borrowings and how they were placed in the
future tense: <O> Examples in Filipino </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#71:1>
At this point, it would be of importance to call to our attention
the rules of the Filipino language on the spelling of borrowed words.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#72:1>
According to the <indig> <it> Surian ng Wikang Pambansa </it>
</indig> ( Edroza-Matute, <foreign> et al. </foreign> , 1987: p. 8) ( 1987:
p. 10): <O> long quotation in Filipino </O>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#73:1>
Take note that the second rule provides that the borrowed word must
be new to the Filipino vocabulary, and presumably, with no Filipino
equivalent.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#74:1>
It is interesting to note, however, that a lot of the words mentioned
above have Filipino equivalents such as <mention> &ldquo; deny &rdquo;
</mention> ( Tagalog <indig> <it> tanggi </it> </indig> ) , <mention> &ldquo;
entertain &rdquo; </mention> ( Tagalog <indig> <it> aliw </it> </indig> ) ,
<mention> &ldquo; stay &rdquo; </mention> ( Tagalog <indig> <it> manatili
</it> </indig> ) , <mention> &ldquo; guest &rdquo; </mention> ( Tagalog
<indig> <it> panauhin </it> </indig> ) , <mention> &ldquo; thank you &rdquo;
</mention> ( Tagalog <indig> <it> salamat </it> </indig> ) , <mention>
&ldquo; claim &rdquo; </mention> ( Tagalog <indig> <it> ariin </it> </indig> )
, <mention> &ldquo; realize &rdquo; </mention> ( Tagalog <indig> <it> natanto
</it> </indig> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#75:1>
One could assume that the reason why the movie magazine writers
refuse to use these Filipino equivalents are for reasons of inconvenience,
formality or frozenness. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#76:1>
The second issue that must be addressed is that of the borrowings
without direct Filipino equivalents and the acceptability of them being
subjected to Tagalog rules on tenses.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#77:1>
Since one could say that these words might still be relatively new to
the Filipino vocabulary, the issue of direct spelling ( as per the
abovementioned rule) is acceptable.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#78:1>
But how about the application of tenses?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#79:1>
Does one consider the morphology of these as &ldquo; Taglish &rdquo;
and inconsistent, with the structure in Tagalog and the vocabulary in
English?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#80:1>
Or is it acceptably Filipino?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#81:1>
According to Edroza-Matute, <foreign> et al. </foreign> ( 1987: p.
22-23) in reference to such a predicament: <O> long quotation in Filipino
</O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#82:1>
As such, a compromise may be acceptable. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#83:1>
<h> <bold> 2. Nouns, Adjectives </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#84:1>
The same observations can be applied to cases wherein an English
borrowing is paired with Filipino prefixes to create nouns and adjectives.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#85:1>
Examples: <O> Examples in Filipino </O> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#86:1>
<h> <bold> 3. English Nouns/Adjectives Functioning as Verbs in
Filipino </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#87:1>
Another interesting observation in the movie magazines is how
nouns or adjectives in English are made to function as Filipino verbs.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#88:1>
Examples: <O> Examples in Filipino </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#89:1>
It must be to the Filipino 's ingenuity that these English nouns
and adjectives are so easily transformed into verbs, again, owing to the ease
with which Filipino affixes can be attached even to borrowed words.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#90:1>
Obviously, it is easier to say <quote> <indig> <it> &ldquo;
Mag-parlor ka nga, &rdquo; </it> </indig> </quote> rather than <quote>
<indig> <it> &ldquo; Pumunta ka nga sa parlor. &rdquo; </it> </indig>
</quote> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#91:1>
<h> <bold> 4. Tense Mix-Up </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#92:1>
There are instances in the movie magazines wherein tenses of
borrowed words get mixed-up.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#93:1>
Examples: <O> Examples in Filipino </O> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#94:1>
<h> <bold> 5. Slang Words </bold> </h> <O> Long quotation in English
</O>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#95:1>
Slang words in movie magazines are derived mainly as a product of
coinage and loanwords given new meanings.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#96:1>
Many of the slang words come from already pre-existing words and get
reshaped by the addition of affixes, reduction or the cutting-off of some
syllables, changes in spelling and contraction.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#97:1>
Some of the words retain their original meanings while the others
carry on entirely new definitions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#98:1>
The coinages in the movie magazines serve different purposes.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#99:1>
Some are used to name, label or brand persons ( example: <indig> <it>
dyowa </it> </indig> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#100:1>
Others, as adjectives or adverbs, are used to describe the reactions
of these persons ( example: <indig> <it> deadma </it> </indig> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#101:1>
The rest may serve as interjections, nouns or special affixes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#102:1>
Foreign words, mostly English, are usually not borrowed as is.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#103:1>
They also go through a process of reshaping and at times, of
changing meanings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#104:1>
One very noticeable convention is the use of <indig> &ldquo; may
i- &rdquo; </indig> as a prefix to verbs, even nouns and adjectives, whether
in English or Filipino.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#105:1>
When <indig> &ldquo; may i- &rdquo; </indig> is added, the word
automatically takes the function of a verb, usually in the past tense.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#106:1>
It serves a purpose almost similar to that of <indig> <it> &ldquo;
nag- &rdquo; </it> </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#107:1>
Example: <O> Examples in Filipino </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#108:1>
Also noticeable is how a number of slang words have sexual
connotations ( example: <indig> <it> dyug </it> </indig> , <foreign> etc.
</foreign> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#109:1>
This phenomenon can be reflective of the kind of movies being shown
and created in the country, the so-called <mention> &ldquo; Titillating Films
&rdquo; </mention> or TF, which cater to the masses, who are consequently,
also the readers of these magazines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#110:1>
One could assume that the movie magazines use slang words to
spice-up their columns and to add humor so that the readers, the masses, are
kept interested.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#111:1>
Slang words have that colloquial character that is presumably
adaptable to the magazines ' market readers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#112:1>
On Table 1 is the list of slang words which have been obtained
from the movie magazines.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#113:1>
Also included are the manner of derivation and the definition. </p>

<h> <bold> A. Syntax </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#115:1>
Here are the sample sentences obtained in the analysis of the
syntax of movie magazines.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#116:1>
They have been classified accordingly and have been roughly ranked,
with the first type as most frequent, and the last as the least frequent in
occurrence.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#117:1>
Borrowings ( words coming from different languages other than the
base language) are indicated by the underscores while code-switchings (
activation of two systems) are italicized. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#124:1>
c. Sentences with borrowing and code-switching to Filipino ( English
base) <O> Examples </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#125:1>
The local movie magazines are essentially in Filipino most
likely owing to the market to which they cater to.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#126:1>
Therefore, one would expect that when borrowings occur, there is
almost always a functional purpose to it.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#127:1>
Sentences with English borrowings are the most frequent.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#128:1>
Writers borrow English nouns, adjectives and verbs when there is no
direct Filipino equivalent ( example: playlist); or if there is a Filipino
equivalent, the expression would remain to be more explicit if said in
English; otherwise, it is done for purposes of convenience as the Filipino
equivalent might be too lengthy or not very colloquial in sound ( example:
&ldquo; sex workers &rdquo; <foreign> vis a vis </foreign> <indig> <it>
&ldquo; mga nagbebenta ng aliw &rdquo; </it> </indig> ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#129:1>
The same reasons are also true for code-switching to English for
certain phrases or expressions ( example: &ldquo; While beating the
deadline...").

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#130:1>
In the Type 2 sentences, code-switching is resorted to since no
amount of Filipino translation can match the ease with which the phrase can
be expressed in English.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#131:1>
The structure remains to be Filipino, though, since the main thought
of the sentences are in Filipino, and for the English code-switches, the
writer could have very well opted to use the indicated Filipino phrases
instead.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#132:1>
Code-switchings occur mostly intersententially. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#133:1>
Bro. Andrew Gonzales ( 1992: p. 90) makes the following
observation on code-switching: <X> <quote> &ldquo; A register has developed
for rapport and intimacy that depends on code-switching between Filipino and
English.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#X134:1>
It is largely...used in...certain types of informal writing in
daily newspapers and weekly magazines. &rdquo; </quote> </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#135:1>
Types 3 and 4 are basically dependent on who the writer is.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#136:1>
These occur as isolated cases for they are not very well-suited to
the market for which these publications are intended. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#137:1>
<h> <bold> VI. Analysis and Discussion </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#138:1>
Bonifacio P. Sibayan ( 1991: p. 242) places the status of the
language of movie magazines in this state: <X> <quote> &ldquo; The Filipino
used in Filipino tabloid newspapers and other publications intended for
popular consumption is modernized but not intellectualized....

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#X139:1>
The modernized Filipino of entertainment... and used in daily
newspapers and magazines circulated among the people may be called a
popularly modernized language ( PML). &rdquo; </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#140:1>
It may be a popularly modernized language but is nonetheless
significant for a PML, being a mass base for growth and development, takes
precedence over intellectual modernization ( 1991: p. 242-243). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#141:1>
One might take notice that movie magazines have a distinct
language of their own, but after closer examination, most of it ( specially
the morphology, borrowing and code-switching) is really no different from the
way residents of Metro Manila speak.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#142:1>
Purists might say that movie magazine morphology is not the kind of
Filipino that is intended to be taught and spread.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#143:1>
Nonetheless, it is accepted because it facilitates communication -
the people know, understand and speak it themselves.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#144:1>
The same holds true for code-switching.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#145:1>
But the researchers maintain that there should be a functional
purpose to code-switching, otherwise, it should be limited if not eliminated.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#146:1>
Another issue that must be looked into is that of borrowing.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#147:1>
Consuelo J. Paz ( 1995: p. 28) sees borrowing as a natural
phenomenon to any living language with contact to outside cultures.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-006#148:1>
It is a way of enriching the borrowing language and must not be seen
as a lowering of its standards.

Paz ( p. 57-58) says that the decision of changing the spelling to

The problem of spelling it as <mention> &ldquo; shooting &rdquo;
</mention> or <mention> <indig> &ldquo; syuting &rdquo; </indig> </mention>
would probably be determined by whether or not the borrowing has already been
accustomed to Filipino, thus the ease of standardizing it by adapting it to
Filipino orthography. </p> ... </I>
