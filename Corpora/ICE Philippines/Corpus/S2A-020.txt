<I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#1:1:A>
Here in the second game <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#2:1:A>
Finished by Kamangyan <&> noise from the audience </&> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#3:1:B>
I can't believe that was blocked at by number seven
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#4:1:B>
Malinao he has that ball

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#5:1:A>
And now the Philippines is one point away from winning the second game <&> break in the recording </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#6:1:A>
Lost to the middle by Kamangyan
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#7:1:A>
The ball goes out

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#8:1:B>
Almost had it but uh didn't find it the successful one

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#9:1:A>
<?> Lani Josef </?> five attack and thirty-seven blocks here in the second game remains
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#10:1:A>
He 's been playing exceptionally well
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#11:1:A>
Another service error for Singapore
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#12:1:A>
That 's number twelve Nang Chi Hue
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#13:1:A>
So the Philippines once again will get the ball back
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#14:1:A>
Serving is Sunico for the game
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#15:1:A>
Open call
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#16:1:A>
Somebody hits the net
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#17:1:A>
Referee rules that it was Malinao

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#18:1:B>
Singapore still has a chance here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#19:1:B>
They can still catch up
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#20:1:B>
We have a substitution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#21:1:B>
Number seven coming in for number ten
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#22:1:B>
Number seven is uh Ong Kyan Bun Chan

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#23:1:A>
Replacing Yu Tsin Hong
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#24:1:A>
Sunico with a <unclear> 2 words </unclear> five set
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#25:1:A>
Blocked but it goes off again Babylonia getting another kill

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#26:1:B>
Game point again for the Philippines

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#27:1:A>
This is Bukid <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#28:1:A>
Eulogio Bukid with a serve
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#29:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#34:1:A>
Sunico with a quick step back step Babylonia
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#35:1:A>
Let 's go team and the Philippines wins the second game fifteen one <&> noise from the audience </&> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#36:1:B>
God
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#37:1:B>
It really is going crazy here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#38:1:B>
It 's a jam-packed Ninoy Aquino Memorial Stadium after the Philippines won their second game against Singapore
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#39:1:B>
Amazing score of fifteen one

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#40:1:A>
Yes the Philippines so over-powering in that second game
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#41:1:A>
They let let 's see that again the action here in the second game
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#42:1:A>
Babylonia with the final point of the second game going cross court finding the open space and putting it away here in the second game <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#43:1:B>

<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#44:1:B>
Philippines won the first game fifteen seven and the second fifteen one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#45:1:B>
It 's got one more game and if uh Philippines wins this will be their second uh match
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#46:1:B>
Yesterday they won against the the Vietnamese team after five sets
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#47:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#48:1:A>
And a very hard-fought match
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#49:1:A>
And you know the <.> mo </.> morale of this team seems to be very high especially after beating a very tough Vietnamese team
 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#50:1:B>
Yes Vietnam has been a surprise to everybody but you know talking about morale is uh the support of the uh the crowd here is very important to the players and uh we invite everybody to come and watch

<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#57:1:A>
Philippines of course again won the first two games of this match fifteen seven fifteen one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#59:1:A>
They 're now only one game away from winning this match against Singapore and for their second consecutive win here in the volleyball event of the sixteenth Southeast Asian Games <,>

Yes for uh game statistics we 've had twenty-eight attacks for both the Singapore <,> and Philippines <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#63:1:B>
We have thirteen blocks for Philippines and none for Singapore
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#64:1:B>
Service aces give five to the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#65:1:B>
Digs we have three for the Philippines and five for Singapore
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#66:1:B>
And uh service errors this is where we had a problem with Singapore
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#67:1:B>
They had two whereas uh Philippines only had one <,> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#68:1:A>
Well Singapore starting strong in the third game coming up with two good attacks
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#69:1:A>
They lead it one to nothing <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#70:1:A>
Kamangyan to Sunico Babylonia gets blocked
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#71:1:A>
And Kamangyan and uh I believe that was number seven <,> Malinag

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#72:1:B>
Yes and on the part of the Singaporeans uh that ball went off the head of number seven Ang Yan Bun Kyan
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#73:1:B>
But the ball <unclear> words </unclear> wrong and hit the part of the body above the waist

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#74:1:A>
And a quick step for Bukid <,> who puts it away once again

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#81:1:C>

<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#93:2:B>
Well right now both teams are all set to go for this match
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#94:2:B>
The starting line-ups have already been uh called and they 're now in the playing court and we can see a big crowd here at the Ninoy Aquino Stadium gathered for what could be another exciting match here in the volleyball event
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#95:2:B>
Myanmar with the starting line-up Renee

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#96:2:C>
Yes uh for Myanmar we have number two Mao and number seven Ai six Chien five Que one So and eleven Mo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#97:2:C>
For the Philippines we have uh number seven Vasquez number three Barina number eight Arceo number nine Paglinawan number ten Iba&ntilde;ez and eleven Apostol

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#98:2:B>
Philippines aiming for the first attack
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#99:2:B>
Here 's Barina Vasquez with a set
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#100:2:B>
It 's Barina

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#101:2:C>
Barina by outside uh tough court right
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#102:2:C>
She 's been a very good player of the Philippine team
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#103:2:C>
Uh she 's been with us for ten years now
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#104:2:C>
And that her experience counts a lot

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#105:2:B>
Barina was wooed out of retirement to come and play in the Southeast Asian games
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#106:2:B>
Service error for Paglinawan as her serve touched off the tip of the tape
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#> Side out for for Myanmar
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#107:2:B>
Serving now is number eight
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#108:2:B>
This is Tan <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#109:2:B>
Some uh clarification is being made by the referee
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#110:2:B>
It 's the first referee from Singapore Mr Ang Shio Ong <O> noise </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#111:2:B>
Good
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#112:2:B>
Picked by Arceo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#113:2:B>
But seems like <,> somebody touched the net
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#114:2:B>
That was number eight Arceo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#115:2:B>
So it 's one all Myanmar ties the game
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#116:2:B>
Paglinawan quick set to Barina <,> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#117:2:C>
The free ball yes goes to the Philippine side
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#118:2:C>
The referee calls it a ball handling double hit uhm by uh number eleven Apostol

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#119:2:A>
So it 's now two to one Myanmar on top
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#120:2:A>
Serving once again is Chien the center for Myanmar
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#121:2:A>
Paglinawan
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#122:2:A>
Arceo gets a good <unclear> words </unclear> <O> noise </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#123:2:A>
Side out for the Philippines as the blockers of Myanmar are unable to contain the attack of Arceo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#124:2:A>
Serving is Arceo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#125:2:A>
That 's wide <,> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#126:2:C>
Yes we have a service error here and uh that was number eight Arceo the outside hitter for the Philippine team

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#127:2:B>
This is Ai or Ei <&> name of the player </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#128:2:B>
Serving Barina
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#129:2:B>
Down the line serve <O> noise </O> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#130:2:C>
Noli you were talking about Barina a while ago for having uh retired but uh you know they needed her to be for the Southeast Asian games and she 's only been training for four months <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#131:2:B>
Myanmar trying to keep with a lot of Ng
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#132:2:B>
Paglinawan to Apostol this is a big moment <O> noise </O> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#133:2:C>
Iba&ntilde;ez has been uh there has a lot of the the chest
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#134:2:C>
Iba&ntilde;ez is uh very small she 's uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#135:2:B>
One point eighty-nine meters a uh stand out
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#136:2:B>
That was number one score
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#137:2:B>
Kept alive by the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#138:2:B>
This Ei back to So
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#139:2:B>
And that time Arceo was able to recover

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#140:2:C>
Nobody was coming from back row and uh just the Philippine team didn't expect the uh the hit by the uh Myanmar

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#141:2:B>
Serving is Ng <O> noise </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#142:2:B>
Apostol coming from the <,> outside for that kill down the line
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#144:2:B>
It 's still two all
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#145:2:B>
Game one <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#146:2:B>
Here 's <,> Myanmar Ai
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#147:2:B>
Barina with a save
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#148:2:B>
Apostol and Iba&ntilde;ez was blocked
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#149:2:B>
The tip <unclear> words </unclear> to Que
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#150:2:B>
Arceo with the recovery and a good fade away by Paglinawan

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#151:2:C>
That was a very very smart move by uh number nine Paglinawan
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#152:2:C>
Yesterday <unclear> words </unclear> seven of which were considered killed <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#153:2:B>
Serving it <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#154:2:B>
Vasquez good quick set
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#155:2:B>
Philippines unable to recover that game from So <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#156:2:B>
So is very is one of the best players of Myanmar at age <,> thirty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#157:2:B>
Paglinawan Apostol gets partially blocked
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#158:2:B>
There 's Chien to So takes over
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#159:2:B>
Iba&ntilde;ez is there
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#160:2:B>
Paglinawan
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#161:2:B>
Iba&ntilde;ez
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#162:2:B>
It 's blocked but it 's saved in
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#163:2:B>
So a point for Myanmar
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#164:2:B>
We 're all tied at three
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#165:2:B>
Serving is number eleven Mao <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#166:2:B>
Paglinawan to Apostol
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#167:2:B>
That 's in <O> clapping </O> <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#168:2:B>
This early in the game some blockers are being seen right away
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#169:2:B>
It seems like the blockers of uh Myanmar still unable to contain the Philippines

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#170:2:C>
Yes uh I think they 're trying to watch out for number ten Iba&ntilde;ez of uh <,> <O> noise </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#171:2:B>
There you see the starting line-up

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#172:2:C>
Vasquez Barina Arceo Apostol Iba&ntilde;ez Paglinawan for the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#173:2:C>
And uh <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#174:2:B>
Number five of Myanmar
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#175:2:B>
Paglinawan to Iba&ntilde;ez
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#176:2:B>
Saved by Que
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#177:2:B>

<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#178:2:B>
There 's Vasquez
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#179:2:B>
Paglinawan back to Iba&ntilde;ez <O> noise </O> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#180:2:C>
Iba&ntilde;ez with another kill
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#181:2:C>
In her last game she had uh twenty-one attempts and uh fourteen of which were killed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#182:2:C>
That is a very good statistic

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#183:2:B>
Ei to Chien <O> noise </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#184:2:B>
Good block by Arceo and Iba&ntilde;ez
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#185:2:B>
Philippines now on top
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#186:2:B>
Six to three in the first game
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#187:2:B>
And an early time-out being called by Myanmar <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#188:2:B>
As their coach Mr Ooi Ken Huen sensing some trouble <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#189:2:B>
What is the Philippines doing right right now uh Renee

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#190:2:C>
One of the good things is that uh setter uh is varying her set uhm mostly but a lot of them are still going to number ten Iba&ntilde;ez who feels uh very dependable and of course number eleven Apostol
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#192:2:C>
This is a very important match for the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#193:2:C>
Myanmar as I 've said earlier is seeded number three and Philippines number four
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#194:2:C>
So uh if Philippines can win this match they have a very good chance at the medal

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-020#195:2:B>
Well Iba&ntilde;ez <,> is being really honed up by Mr Stanislav Lugardov the trainor from Russia for the Philippines <,> <{> <[> well </[>
