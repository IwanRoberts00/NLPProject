<h> <bold> Plans and Programs </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#3:1>
For 2001, the following activities shall be undertaken to support
and operationalize the strategies that have been laid down. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#4:1>
1. Continuous implementation and monitoring of the following programs
and projects which will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of LTO
operations.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#5:1>
<h> 1.1 LTO Information Technology Project </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#6:1>
This project is being implemented under the BOO scheme.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#7:1>
It aims to provide an information highway enabling online transaction
processing and allow the interconnection of all LTO District Offices and
Regional Offices nationwide. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#8:1>
Nationwide rollout is scheduled January to June 2001.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#9:1>
Full implementation is expected before the year ends. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#10:1>
<h> 1.2 Motor Vehicle Inspection and Emission Testing System (
MVIETS) Project </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#11:1>
The project involves the construction of an initial 124 MVIETS
inspection lanes ( 29 for motorcycles and 95 for cars, trucks and buses) all
over the country, especially for high motor vehicle density areas such as
NCR, Metro Cebu, Metro Davao, <foreign> etc. </foreign>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#12:1>
This aims to provide a safe and clean transportation environment
through a mechanized system of motor vehicle inspection. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#13:1>
The submitted unsolicited proposal is now being reviewed by NEDA.
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#14:1>
<h> 1.3 Motor Vehicle License Plate Plant </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#15:1>
The project is planned to be implemented in a BOO scheme.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#16:1>
Aside from the provision of new plate making plants, the project
shall also have support services to include computerization and communication
components to ensure that vehicle license plates are traceable and
identifiable in a real time basis. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#17:1>
The feasibility study for the project has been submitted to DOTC.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#18:1>
Options are now being studied on how the project will be implemented.
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#19:1>
<h> 1.4 Manila Air Quality Improvement Program </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#20:1>
Pursuant to pertinent provisions of RA 8749 otherwise known as
Phil. Clean Air Act of 1999, the DOTC, through the LTO, shall enforce
compliance with the emission standards for motor vehicles.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#21:1>
The program aims for a comprehensive air pollution management and
control. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#22:1>
The Asian Development Bank ( ADB) has approved LTO 's request for
the acquisition of smoke emission testers to be installed in all LTO District
Offices and for the acquisition of vehicles to be used in apprehending
violators. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#23:1>
<h> 1.5

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#24:1>
Road Safety Project </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#25:1>
The objective of this project is to protect the road users from
accidents and other road hazards.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#26:1>
Among its activities are :

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#27:1>
<h> a. Drug Testing Program </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#28:1>
Under the law, LTO should not issue professional licenses to drug
addicts or dependents.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#29:1>
To ensure enforcement of this law, the LTO, through BGC-99-001, shall
require all applicants for professional driver license, whether new or
renewal, to undergo drug testing at the nearest accredited drug testing
centers effective 01 February 2001. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#30:1>
<h> b. Drivers Training Program </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#31:1>
The system is intended to educate drivers on traffic rules and
regulations as well as develop their proper skills and behavior in driving.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#32:1>
Three hundred forty three ( 343) drivers from other government
agencies have already attended the various seminars held last year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#33:1>
This is a continuing project which we hope to expand this year to
cover private and for hire vehicle drivers. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#34:1>
<h> c. Drivers Manual </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#35:1>
The objective of this activity is to educate the Filipino drivers
on traffic rules and regulations as well as provide them motoring tips.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#36:1>
More copies of the manual shall be reproduced depending upon LTO 's
budget. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#37:1>
<h> d. Accreditation and Close Supervision of Driving Schools </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#38:1>
Upgrading of the standards in the accreditation of driving
schools to ensure proper education of drivers is being done.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#39:1>
For this year, we are working on weeding out unfit driving schools to
benefit incoming student drivers. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#40:1>
<h> e. Outreach Program </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#41:1>
This project entails visits to schools, bus companies, private
and public organizations to conduct lectures on road safety.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#42:1>
This is a continuing undertaking of the Office in the promotion of
public awareness to transportation laws, rules and regulations. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#43:1>
<h> 1.6 MV Users Charge ( RA 8749) </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#44:1>
This law has been passed to ensure that there are adequate funds
for the proper maintenance of all national and provincial roads.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#45:1>
Registration fee would now be called Motor Vehicle User Charge or
MVUC.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#46:1>
Effective date of implementation is 01 January 2001. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#47:1>
This is expected to raise LTO 's revenues in registration fees by
25%. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#48:1>
<h> 1.7 Motor Vehicle Registration System ( MVRS) Project </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#49:1>
This project will establish the history of every registered motor
vehicle through the buildup of an MVRR database and its integration with the
databases created in the preceding phases.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#50:1>
Aside from verification purposes, these databases will also serve as
the initial data for the LTO-IT Project. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#51:1>
For the year 2001, encoding of 2000 MVRRs shall be done.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#52:1>
The project will end once the LTO-IT Project is successfully
implemented nationwide. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#53:1>
<h> 1.8 Increase in Fees and Charges </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#54:1>
This is a program to increase the revenue earning capacity of the
Office.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#55:1>
LTO has already done a thorough study on the matter.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#56:1>
The proposal has been forwarded to DOTC for final review and
approval. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#57:1>
Once implemented, this undertaking shall increase the Office'
revenues for license fees and fines and penalties on apprehensions by 70%.
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#58:1>
<h> 1.9 Computer-based Management Information System ( MIS) </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#59:1>
This system gathers, consolidates, compiles, presents and
analyzes statistical data of the different operations of the Office
nationwide.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#60:1>
It is aimed to provide management with timely, accurate and reliable
information for its policy formulation and decision making.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#61:1>

<h> <bold> TAX-FILES </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#122:2>
<h> <bold> Mandatory e-filing and e-payment for large taxpayers
</bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#123:2>
<bold> By Mellany D. Morales </bold>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#124:2>
<it> SGV & Co. </it> <&> ( Note: Second part of article) </&>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#125:2>
<h> <bold> Mandatory e-filing and e-payment </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#126:2>
Beginning 2001, large taxpayers are mandated to e-file their
final adjustment income tax returns.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#127:2>
They must also e-pay the taxes due through the EFPS on or before the
15th day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#128:2>
This mandatory e-filing and e- payment shall continue for all
fiscal years as well as the succeeding calendar years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#129:2>
Nonetheless, e-payment is optional for tax returns that will be
filed until June 30, 2002.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#130:2>
Thus, for a large taxpayer who does not choose to pay electronically
for these returns, payment should be made manually. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#131:2>
Beginning July 1, 2002, however, large taxpayers are mandated to
e-file all tax returns that can be filed electronically and e-pay taxes due
through the EFPS. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#132:2>
Presently, only the following tax returns produced by the EFPS
can be filed electronically:

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#133:2>
a) 1601C - Monthly Remittance Return of Income Tax Withheld on
Compensation;

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#134:2>
b) 1601E - Monthly Remittance Return of Creditable Income Taxes
Withheld ( Expanded);

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#135:2>
c) 1602 - Remittance Return of Final Taxes Withheld;

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#136:2>
d) 1603 - Remittance Return of Final Income Taxes Withheld on Fringe
Benefits Paid to Employees other than Rank and File;

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#137:2>
e) 1700 - Annual Income Tax Return;

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#138:2>
f) 1702 - Annual Income Tax Return for Corporations and
Partnerships;

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#139:2>
g) 1702Q - Quarterly Income Tax Return for Corporations and
Partnerships;

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#140:2>
h) 2200A - Excise Tax Return for Alcohol Products;

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#141:2>
i) 2200P - Excise Tax Return for Petroleum Products;

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#142:2>
j) 2200T - Excise Tax Return for Tobacco Products;

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#143:2>
k) 2550M - Monthly Value-Added Tax Declaration;

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#144:2>
l) 2550Q - Quarterly Value-Added Tax Return; and

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#145:2>
m) 2551- Percentage Tax Return </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#146:2>
<h> <bold> Optional e-filing and e-payment </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#147:2>
Beginning July 1, 2002, e-filing and e-payment shall be
voluntary for 200 non-large taxpayers identified by the BIR.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#148:2>
These non-large taxpayers may e-file not only their final adjustment
income tax returns but also all of the tax returns that can be filed
electronically. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#149:2>
E-filing and e-payment are not yet available for everyone.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#150:2>
Non-large taxpayers who are not among the 200 identified by the BIR
may not use the EFPS, at least until the appropriate regulations for this
group are issued. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#151:2>
There is an exception to this rule.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#152:2>
Officials and employees of the BIR may e-file their returns and
e-pay their taxes due through the EFPS upon the discretion of the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#153:2>
Following the issuance of RR 2-2002, taxpayers who have
previously enrolled in the EFPS, have been delisted.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#154:2>
As such, these taxpayers, if qualified, would have to reenroll. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#155:2>
Large taxpayers and identified taxpayers that would like to use
the EFPS should enroll according to the provisions of applicable regulations,
circulars and orders, particularly Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 24-01
dated May 8, 2002. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#156:2>
As of this writing, the BIR has not yet issued any new circular
to implement the changes in the EFPS.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#157:2>
In the meantime, large taxpayers and identified taxpayers that would
like to use the EFPS should take note of the following changes in the
procedure for enrollment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#158:2>
The officers required by law to file returns shall enroll
juridical entities or artificial persons.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#159:2>
These officers are identified in RR 2-2002.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#160:2>
For domestic corporations, enrollment should be made by the
president, the vice president or other principa1 officers; for partnership,
the managing partner; for joint ventures, the managing head; and for resident
foreign corporations, the country manager. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#161:2>
A corporate taxpayer only has to submit secretary 's certificate
identifying the officers. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#162:2>
<h> <bold> Penalties </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#163:2>
Large taxpayers face stiffer penalties if they fail to e-file
their returns and e-pay their taxes.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#164:2>
Failure to comply with the provisions of RR 2-2002 shall be
penalized under Section 275 of the Tax Code of 1997. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#165:2>
Thus, a violation carries with it the penalty of imprisonment of
not more than six months or a fine of not more than &peso;1,000, or both.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#166:2>
Moreover, only the first and second offenses may be compromised.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#167:2>
For the third and subsequent offenses, no compromise shall be
entertained or allowed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#168:2>
Large taxpayers and identified taxpayers that would like to use
the EFPS should take note of the deadlines in e-filing their returns and
e-paying their taxes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#169:2>
The recent amendment to the EFPS is first in a series of changes
to be implemented by the BIR to completely computerize taxpayers '
transactions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#170:2>
For sure, there will be subsequent regulations making e-filing
and e-payment mandatory for other taxpayers.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#171:2>
Eventually, e-filing and e-payment will become mandatory for all.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#172:2>
Keep in mind that the BIR is serious in achieving paperless
filing of returns and payment of taxes.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#173:2>


<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-007#174:2>
For taxpayers who have not yet invested in the required hardware
and software to use the EFPS ( <foreign> i.e. </foreign> a computer with a
modem, an Internet service provider, a browser and an e-mail account), now is
a good time to start. </p> </I>
