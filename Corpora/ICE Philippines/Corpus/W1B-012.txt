Subject: Hi from LA, and eager to come home

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#6:1>
Hi loves,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#7:1>
I am now in LA and just working on my emails, super eager for it
to be Tuesday night so I will be flying home.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#8:1>
Charley, please print this out for Mama so she has something to read
tonight.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#9:1>
At least now she will not be anxious because my flight is confirmed.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#10:1>
Here 's my <indig> kwento </indig> : </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#11:1>
Like most of the world, to me it was a wild and wooly week.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#12:1>
I arrived in NYC on Monday, Sept. 10 at around midnight after a long
layover in Chicago because my original connecting flight was cancelled and I
had to take the next flight.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#13:1>
I just had a few hours of sleep because of the jet lag, and upon
awakening on Tuesday morning at exactly nine, I turned on the TV just in time
to see the second jet crash into the WTC!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#14:1>
Like I guess everyone on this earth, I was glued to the TV that day
and totally unbelieving of man 's inhumanity to man.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#15:1>
Wasn't it incredible, and just amazing at how easily a huge plane
could disappear inside a big building, like a knife slicing into butter?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#16:1>
I immediately called and woke up <indig> Tita </indig> Puput to tell
her that I was safe and for her to turn on her TV right away.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#17:1>
It is funny how far away the 3 hour difference makes California from
the East coast. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#18:1>
Many friends emailed, including the Kalaws from Vancouver, to ask
whether I was safe, but you 've been to Rye Brook and you know that I was
quite far from ground zero, and out of harm 's way.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#19:1>
While watching TV I agreed that grounding all the flights was a great
move, but I didn't realize that that meant the Area Directors for Greater
China and Japan couldn't make it to our budget meeting as they were diverted
to Nova Scotia and as I learned later, they slept on mats inside a gymnasium
in Halifax for three days!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#20:1>
I also didn't realize at that time that the FAA directive would have
a significant impact on my own travel back to the Philippines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#21:1>
I don't know how I was able to work on my 2002 budget deck which
I was going to present the next day, as I clearly wasn't in the mood for
anything.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#22:1>
I had a quick bite in the dining room of the hotel and as could be
expected, people in the hotel were moving around like zombies as their minds
and hearts were also somewhere else.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#23:1>
People dining around me talked about a relative or a friend who
worked in the WTC and of course at that time nobody was certain of anybody 's
fate.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#24:1>
Tuesday was a long day ( I also went to the office) and sleep didn't
come easy.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#25:1>
I was finally able to doze off at around 2 AM but before finally
sleeping, prayed real hard that my presentation the following day would go
well. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#26:1>
It did, and thank you all for your prayers.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#27:1>
<indig> Lola </indig> told me afterwards that she had prayed the
rosary on her knees, and my goodness, how could the Lord have refused your
<indig> Lola </indig> !

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#28:1>
My Southeast Asia presentation was probably the best of the lot,
because it was the quickest, with the fewest questions, and in the end our
big boss commended me for a job well done.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#29:1>
During his summary he said, <quote> &ldquo; what is there not to like
about SEA? &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#30:1>
While people thought <@> Billy Summers </@> , the CEO, was going to
be less intense, given all that had happened, true to form, he wasn't.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#31:1>
He figuratively crushed all those who came unprepared or whose
numbers weren't to his liking.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#32:1>
Except for the fact that all the body bags were all reserved for the
WTC, we could have used a few.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#33:1>
We came out limping out of that conference room, bone tired - we
started at 9 AM and ended at 8 PM.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#34:1>
In fact our formal dinner was canceled as all the head office people
just wanted to go home and they obviously weren't in the mood for social
amenities, which was fine with me.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#35:1>
I had dinner with some of the Filipino colleagues from Kraft and we
had a terrific steak dinner.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#36:1>
I know, I know, but steak is one of my comfort foods.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#37:1>
I had an 18 ounce T-bone, seared on the outside but medium rare
inside, excellent! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#38:1>
On Thursday morning I learned that the airports were still closed
and worse, my flight back on Friday was also canceled.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#39:1>
I called up Joji in Manila for her to get me on any flight out of NY
as it was really a hot spot.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#40:1>
Anyway I still had my meeting and dinner with Ray Rogan, our
distributor in New York, who picked me up around noon, and we drove to New
Jersey where we had our meeting.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#41:1>
Later I finally met Lani, his daughter, and her fianc&eacute;, Carl
Wilson, a Brit.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#42:1>
Carl is okay and they will make a good couple.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#43:1>
Afterwards we went to the <mention> Manor </mention> , a nice Country
Club where the reception is going to be held exactly a week from Saturday.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#44:1>
They wanted to show me what I was going to miss, and we took a few
pictures, and had a great seafood meal.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#45:1>
Towards the end I offered a toast, I gave some words of advice and
the night was over.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#46:1>
The Rogans send their love and regards to the whole family.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#47:1>
In my mind throughout the dinner, however, and unbeknownst to them,
was how the hell I was going to go home. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#48:1>
On Friday morning, after three difficult hours of connecting with
the airlines and going through all sorts of routing ( going to Canada, where
there were 6 hour waits at the border, and then catching a flight from
Montreal) and still coming up blank, including a notice from JAL ( my
original booking) that the earliest they could confirm a flight back to
Manila was on September 20(!), Joji called to say that I was confirmed on PAL
( which, incidentally I am forbidden to ride, for safety reasons) on Sept. 18
( Tuesday) from LAX.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#49:1>
Now the problem was how to get to LA.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#50:1>
Luckily I learned that my boss was going to drive to Minneapolis ( a
21-hour drive) via Chicago ( a 14-hour drive) and so I offered to go with
him, figuring that I would have an easier time catching a flight out of
Chicago other than NY.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#51:1>
So on Friday afternoon at 2 PM we set out on a Hertz rental car,
drove for 7 hours, slept over in a clean and comfy Holiday Inn in Du Bois,
Pennsylvania, where I had a glimpse of middle America during breakfast ( lots
of pot bellied people wearing baseball caps), started again at 7:30 AM and
got to Chicago at 3 PM.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#52:1>
Along the way I made reservations at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago and
that is where my boss dropped me off. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#53:1>
You know, the driving trip was actually not bad.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#54:1>
Cruise control is a terrific invention but while technology has made
things easier, the strain on the back, the pinch and fatigue on the butt
still felt the same.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#55:1>
On the other hand, it was food for the soul - we drove through some
nice countryside in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana, places I had never been
before.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#56:1>
I really felt good seeing the sign <quote> Pennsylvania welcomes you
</quote> , and sort of leaving the bad memories of New York behind.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#57:1>
14 hours of driving made me realize just how big North America is,
and telling myself never, ever to take flying for granted because it is truly
a time and lifesaver.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#58:1>
Chicago of course has been a long time favorite of mine, and upon
seeing the skyline, with the Sears tower on the horizon I felt a renewed
spirit, a cautious optimism that things were still going to be all right.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#59:1>
Freshly situated at the Hyatt, with a river view in the hotel on
Saturday afternoon, I let my fingers do the walking but unfortunately came up
zero with the big airlines that offered direct flights.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#60:1>
I then tried the small regional airlines and finally struck gold with
Southwest who had available seats, but sorry, no first or business classes.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#61:1>
I then called up Nora, my <indig> balae </indig> , and she and Jet
picked me up around 6 PM and brought me to a baby shower for one of Nora 's
nieces.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#62:1>
At last I had Filipino food, and most important, they had rice.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#63:1>
A few of those who attended Tricia 's wedding were also there but
forgive me as I have forgotten their names.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#64:1>
Joe and Marty, Jude 's uncle and aunt were there, as well as the
<indig> Lola </indig> of Jude.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#65:1>
They were asking me to stay longer so we could play golf but I told
them no, my first priority was to get to LA.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#66:1>
Tricia, your mother in law is looking well. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#67:1>
I woke up at 5 AM and took a cab to the airport.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#68:1>
Incidentally when I checked in they opened my luggage right there on
the check-out counter, and the counter lady just put on plastic gloves and
boom, she went through each inch of my luggage.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#69:1>
Two more passport checks and finally I was on the plane.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#70:1>
So yesterday there I was, first on a flight to Las Vegas, in coach
like all the rest of the world and not really caring that I was in the back
of the plane.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#71:1>
And as I watched the clouds underneath go by, and seated beside a
gentleman with a cane who claimed he is going to a poetry convention in Las
Vegas because he is a writer and a poet and who has written two books and is
well on finishing his third, and because of his knurled fingers kept asking
me to open the small food packs given by the airline, I knew that nearly all
was well with me.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#72:1>
And despite all the anxieties of the last week, I am content in the
knowledge that finally I am on my way home to my family whom I miss very much
and yes, God loves me. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#73:1>
From Las Vegas I connected on a short hop to LAX.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#74:1>
While waiting I had a small <foreign> pepperoni pizza </foreign> and
lost &dollar;5 dollars at the slot machines.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#75:1>
I landed in LA and saw that they were only allowing tour buses,
shuttles and taxis into the airport.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#76:1>
Private vehicles go to a terminal outside the airport and the people
are bused in, which is such a hassle.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#77:1>
When I got to <indig> Tita </indig> Puput 's house nothing stirred
inside - no wonder I always got Jiffy 's voice mail whenever I called.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#78:1>
Anyway I called up <indig> Tito </indig> Vic ( using the taxi driver 's
cell phone) and he told me that the Galvezes had gone to Las Vegas because
Jiffy had a gig!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#79:1>
In fact as I learned later on, as I was taking off they were starting
to drive back to Pasadena.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#80:1>
Anyway I found a Comfort Inn and checked in, and here I am finishing
this before I check-out and move to <indig> Tita </indig> Puput 's house.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#81:1>
Last night, after mass, we had a nice Chinese dinner to celebrate
<indig> Tita </indig> Puput 's birthday.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#82:1>
After dinner I watched Band of Brothers on HBO, which is excellent.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#83:1>
<indig> Lola </indig> is having a nice time - she watches all her
favorite TV shows, played <foreign> mahjong </foreign> once and won
&dollar;10 and today she will be attending a seminar at <indig> Tita </indig>
Puput 's parish.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#84:1>
She is one happy camper.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#85:1>
I heard she has also cooked <indig> sinigang </indig> for the
Galvezes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#86:1>
Loves, I will be home soon.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#87:1>
I really can't wait to see you and Mama. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#88:1>
Papa </I> <subtext 2>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#89:2>
Hi to everyone. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#90:2>
To <indig> ATE </indig> ADJ,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#91:2>
Yesterday while Rica and I waited for the moviegoers I checked
the state of repair of Mommy 's leaking pipe and saw an old dollhouse
standing in the mud.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#92:2>
I asked the maid to wash it to see if it still could be used and she
said there were other parts on the other side of the house.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#93:2>
It was Ana 's dollhouse and I asked permission from Mommy if Rica
could have it.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#94:2>
Of course, she said yes and from the clump of banana trees out came
2/3 of the dollhouse.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#95:2>
Three units <indig> pala siya, ang laki-laki </indig> !

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#96:2>
A few cracks here and there but was still usable. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#97:2>
When we got home from dinner with Mommy and <indig> Ate </indig>
Tish, the boys and Rica kept going around the house and didn't want to sleep.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#98:2>
They wanted to start furnishing the dollhouse immediately!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#99:2>
Super-excited <indig> sila </indig> and of course I am happy since
the boys will be distracted from the playstation and do some creative
construction instead.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#100:2>
<indig> Pero </indig> Tato was the happiest, he goes <quote> &ldquo;
The best thing is that it 's for free! &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#101:2>
Also , Rica was sporting the pair of shoes you gave her during
the houseblessing.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#102:2>
She likes it so much and was showing it off to her <indig> lola
</indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#103:2>
So, <indig> maraming salamat </indig> and please send our thanks
to <indig> Ate </indig> Ana as well.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#104:2>
<indig> Magkakamukha na ang mga girls mo sa pictures </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#105:2>
We miss you also. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#106:2>
See you guys on Thursday. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-012#107:2>
Joville </I>
