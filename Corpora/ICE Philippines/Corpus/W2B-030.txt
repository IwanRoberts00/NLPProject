<h> <bold> When the rainy season comes, devastation follows for the
Philippine shellfish </bold> </h>

SEAWEEDS were her first field of study, but when red tide
infestation of the seas started to become a recurring phenomenon in the
Philippines, Dr. Rhodora Azanza, a professor at the UP Institute of Marine
Science, considered going into researching what lay behind it.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#5:1>
Since then, Azanza has become the coordinator of the ASEAN Red Tide
Network.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#6:1>
Red tide is an occurrence that has been observed not only in the
Philippines and neighboring countries, but in other parts of the world as
well--Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Norway and Denmark, Canada and the
United States.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#7:1>
<mention> Red tide </mention> refers to the accumulation of red
microscopic marine plants or algae called <mention> dinoflagellates
</mention> that can color the sea red when they become proliferous enough.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#8:1>
<h> <bold> Poisonous. </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#9:1>
Singly, a cell of the dinoflagellate does not look so threatening.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#10:1>
Single-celled, roundish and with hairs that enable it to move in
water, a dinoflagellate may be ingested when swimming in infested waters with
no effect to the human body.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#11:1>
Given the right conditions, however--warm water temperatures, the
inflow into the sea of organic pollutants that get washed down with the
rains--the cyst blooms, or proliferates, becoming highly poisonous. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#12:1>
In large densities the red tide 1) has given the Red Sea its
name, 2) is often the cause of large fishkills ( remember the floating dead
fish in the Manila Bay in October 1996?) and 3) ingested by mussels and other
shellfish, which become the vectors that transfer the effect of the &ldquo;
blooms &rdquo; to humans.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#13:1>
This species of dinoflagellates that causes the red tide produces a
toxin that causes paralysis of the nerves and the respiratory system in
humans, leading to serious cases of poisoning to death. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#14:1>
In open seas, the danger is slight.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#15:1>
If the temperature of the water is low, the pollutants may disperse.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#16:1>
But in bodies of water like the Manila Bay, says Azanza, the danger
is high.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#17:1>
The bay is almost enclosed by land; its mouth is too narrow to allow
the polluted waters to flow out to the sea and allow the inflow of clean sea
water.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#18:1>
This condition becomes favorable for the proliferation of the
dinoflagellates during certain periods of the year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#19:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The resting stage of the cysts, &rdquo; </quote>
explains Azanza, <quote> &ldquo; get embedded in the sediment on the floor of
the bay.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#20:1>
Under favorable conditions, as during the rainy season, the sediment
is disturbed, freeing cysts [ to germinate] or [ bloom] into cells [ that]
can move. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#21:1>
When the blooms become dense enough, she says, they give the sea a
red color.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#22:1>
Mussels and other shellfish farmed on the coasts of the Manila Bay,
from Limay in Bataan at the north channel down to Ternate in Cavite, ingest
water contaminated with the cysts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#23:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Mussels are specially vulnerable, their feeding
behavior being less selective than other marine organisms, &rdquo; </quote>
Azanza says.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#24:1>
It has been observed, however, that shellfish cultured in the
shallower parts of the bay contain less dinoflagellates than those raised in
deeper parts.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#25:1>
At low tide, Azanza explains, the shells are exposed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#26:1>
As first consumers of the dinoflagellate, the shellfish can
survive the toxins.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#27:1>
Passed on to humans, however--the mussel or oyster eaters--they
become harmful.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#28:1>
The symptoms range from mild to severe neurological disorders called
paralytic shellfish poisoning, or PSP.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#29:1>
The victim feels a numbness around the lips and has difficulty of
breathing.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#30:1>
Later paralysis takes over.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#31:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The toxins attack the nervous system and respiratory
organs, &rdquo; </quote> says Azanza. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#32:1>
The dinoflagellates need inorganic nutrients such as nitrates and
phosphorus.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#33:1>
These may come with the rains, which wash them down to the sea, and
also from wastes thrown into the sea from ships.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#34:1>
The blooms usually occur following heavy rainfall.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#35:1>
With the <mention> <foreign> El Ni&ntilde;o </foreign> </mention> ,
however, there has been no incidence of red tide except last month in Hong
Kong, where all fishing was knocked out. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#36:1>
<h> <foreign> <bold> La Ni&ntilde;a. </bold> </foreign> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#37:1>
For all the economic disaster that <mention> <foreign> El Ni&ntilde;o
</foreign> </mention> has caused ( according to the Asian Development Bank,
more than &dollar;20 billion in losses for Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and the Pacific islands, and a 1 percent reduction in
productivity for this year), those who live on the mussels and oyster
business are thankful for it: because there are no rains, the seas have
remained largely undisturbed.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#38:1>
And so are the dinoflagellates.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#39:1>
But when the rains come ( about July, says the weather bureau), the
microorganisms, among them the species of marine algae that produce the
paralysis-inducing toxins, will surface and proliferate.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#40:1>
Azanza warns of <mention> <foreign> La Ni&ntilde;a </foreign>
</mention> , the period of heavy rains that follows <mention> <foreign> El
Ni&ntilde;o </foreign> </mention> , and renewed red-tide infestations of the
seas.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#41:1>
Shellfish farmers in sites known to have red-tide infestations have
been advised to harvest their produce before <mention> <foreign> La
Ni&ntilde;a </foreign> </mention> occurs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#42:1>
Since 1988, blooms of the <foreign> <it> pyrodinium bahamense
</it> </foreign> of the <foreign> <it> compressum </it> </foreign> variety,
the scientific name for the harmful dinoflagellates, have been recurring
along the coasts of Manila Bay.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#43:1>
Monthly samplings of the coastal waters, from April 1993 to May 1994,
showed various densities of the cyst, with Bataan having the highest at 176
plus or minus 39 cysts per cubic centimeter of water, and Bulacan the lowest
at 11 plus or minus 3 per ccm.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#44:1>
Living cysts were found in all areas throughout the year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#45:1>
There have been seasonal variations in the cyst densities at
different locations, with the higher counts being recorded during April to
August and the lower in the bay area suggest that blooms are coming from
overlying and adjacent waters and that means these areas are infested. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#46:1>
According to a paper on the impacts of harmful algae on
seafarming in the Asia-Pacific region, written by Azanza ( under her married
name, Rhodora A. Corrales) and Jal L. Maclean of the International Center for
Living Aquatic Resources Management, 3,164 recorded cases of poisoning and
148 deaths have been recorded in the region.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#47:1>
Economic losses from a single occurrence may exceed &dollar;1
million, while monitoring costs may be up to &dollar;50,000 a year for each
stricken area.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#48:1>
National action plans include shellfish sanitation programs, public
awareness and education, coastal engineering and classification of waters to
protect public health. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#49:1>
The <foreign> <it> P. bahamense var. compressum </it> </foreign>
has been the major cause of toxic red tides in the Philippines, with 1,618
cases of poisoning and 100 deaths.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#50:1>
The first blooming occurred off Samar in 1988 and was observed by
Japanese marine researchers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#51:1>
It has been recurring almost every year since then. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#52:1>
Studies conducted by a team headed by Azanza showed that cyst
densities between Bataan ( northwest side of the bay) and Canacao ( northeast
within the bay) are not significantly different from each other but they are
significantly different from Bulacan, Pampanga, Para&ntilde;aque and Ternate,
which are all located in the inner portion of the bay.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#53:1>
Limay, in Bataan, showing the highest density of cysts has an almost
year-round red-tide outbreak.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#54:1>
The second highest density was recorded for Canacao Bay in Cavite.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#55:1>
Poisonings have been reported in this area, which has a booming
mussel-farming industry. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#56:1>
Para&ntilde;aque and Metro Manila had the third highest density
at an average of 38 plus or minus 5 cysts per cubic centimeter.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#57:1>
Fourth highest was Ternate, Cavite.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#58:1>
Oyster farming is common in this area ( especially near the mouth of
the Maragondon River).

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#59:1>
Cyst density in Pampanga Bay was 14 plus or minus 5 cysts/cubic
centimeter, the fifth highest.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#60:1>
Pamarawan, Bulacan, had the lowest average density at 11 plus minus 3
cysts per cubic centimeter.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#61:1>
Oyster farming and seasonal gathering of bivalves also flourish in
this area. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#62:1>
With a comparatively high per capita fishery consumption of 41 (
comparable to Malaysia at 43; China, 45; Japan, 83), the Philippines has
always been hard hit by red-tide infestations, with staggering fish and
shrimp kills and numerous poisonings.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#63:1>
In the region, red-tide poisoning also happens with infestations in
Brunei and Malaysia. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#64:1>
<h> <bold> Panic. </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#65:1>
What happens during occasional acute outbreaks, with reports of
poisoning, offers an opportunity for a study of public behavior and reaction
to disaster.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#66:1>
Notable is the sudden panic among the people that triggers an
overreaction, which does not do much to ease the situation, in fact worsens
it.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#67:1>
The economic impact can be disproportionately large because consumers
who are not well informed about the cause and consequences of the outbreak
tend to avoid even non-contaminated seafood. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#68:1>
An account of the infestation of Manila Bay in 1998 ( in the <it>
Journal of Applied Psychology </it> , 1995) reflects what happens in a place
where there is not much understanding of a red-tide outbreak: In August and
September 1998, an outbreak occurred in Manila Bay.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#69:1>
Because it was played up by the media without regard to accuracy, the
whole seafood industry nearly ground to a halt.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#70:1>
Mussel growers even tried to cast suspicion on freshwater fish to
avoid the swing by consumers to <foreign> tilapia </foreign> and other
fishes.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#71:1>
All fish markets in Manila were depressed for about three months,
similar to the case in San Francisco in 1980.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#72:1>
Considering that Manila 's seafoods market handles 35 percent of the
nation 's fish haul, the losses were large, up to &dollar;300,000 daily at
the height of the scare.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#73:1>
Japan and Singapore banned shrimp imports from the Philippines for
some time ( although they were clean), which would have meant losses of
&dollar;500,000 daily if the produce was not subsequently sold.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#74:1>
Losses by mussel growers for a three-month period were more modest,
about &dollar;950,000 throughout. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#75:1>
If life is threatened, there is no option but to close seafarming
sites permanently.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#76:1>
In Southeast Asia, some seafarmed areas have had to be permanently
closed and these include the Philippines ' Banban Bay, Masinloc and Benoni
Lagoon in Mindanao.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#77:1>
A permanent ban on the fish <foreign> <it> Gobius criniger </it>
</foreign> ( common name, <indig> goby </indig> ) , which feeds on microalgae
and sporadically becomes toxic without sufficient warning has been
recommended by the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#78:1>
What causes algal poisoning of shellfish?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#79:1>
The researchers have a few theories.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#80:1>
Maybe, it is just that today, with advanced technology, there is
increased awareness of the poisonous species.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#81:1>
Coastal waters are increasingly used for aquaculture.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#82:1>
Euthropication has occurred.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#83:1>
This is a situation where increased presence of mineral and organic
substances has decreased the dissolved oxygen in the water and produced an
environment favorable to plant rather than animal life. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#84:1>
Unusual climatological conditions stimulate algal blooms.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#85:1>
Dinoflagellate cysts can be transported from one place to another
through the ballast water in ships.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#86:1>
The transfer of shellfish stocks can also bring about incidents of
algal bloom. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#87:1>
More recent hypotheses to explain poisonous algal outbreaks
include the loss of wetlands or swamps ( reclaimed for purposes like housing
or industry), overfishing and fish diseases.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#88:1>
Global changes can also trigger an outbreak of red tide. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#89:1>
Environmentalists are one in denouncing the pollution of the seas
as a cause of the proliferation of the red-tide algae.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#90:1>
High water temperatures along with the input of organic compounds
that flow into the sea with heavy rains form the right combination that can
cause the dinoflagellates to multiply rapidly. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#91:1>
Fishkills can happen in enclosed bays ( like the Manila Bay) when
the blooms, otherwise quite harmless, and the bacteria decomposing them, use
up the available oxygen in the water, depriving the fish and other forms of
marine life of the life giving compound and killing them by the thousands.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#92:1>
Fishkills do not happen in the open sea, but in sheltered bays with
restricted outflows. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#93:1>
But not all dinoflagellates are harmful, says a plankton
specialist, Dr. Gustaaf Hallegraef.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#94:1>
He points out that <quote> &ldquo; of 1,500 species floating in the
world 's oceans, only a mere 20 have the ability to produce toxins. &rdquo;
</quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#95:1>
Because they are exceedingly small, he says, each can produce only
minute quantities of the toxin.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#96:1>
One does not suffer any effect from swimming in infected waters, for
instance, because of the small amount of dinoflagellates that can be ingested
while swimming.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#97:1>
<quote> &ldquo; It 's when we eat seafood that fed on the
dinoflagellates that the problem arises, &rdquo; </quote> Hallegraef says.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#98:1>
Oysters, mussels and scallops extract large quantities of the
dinoflagellates from the water continuously passing through their gills.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#99:1>
The accumulated toxin, though apparently harmless to the shellfish,
makes the shellfish a time bomb.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#100:1>
The person who eats the shellfish gets poisoned. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#101:1>
<h> <bold> Symptoms. </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#102:1>
The severity of the symptoms can range from a mild stomach upset
with diarrhea to severe neurological disorders classified as paralytic
shellfish poisoning, which can result in death from paralysis of the
respiratory muscles. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#103:1>
Regularly testing the sea water for dinoflagellates will prevent
the sale of contaminated shellfish.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#104:1>
If dinoflagellates are found, the shellfish must be tested for
toxins.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#105:1>
This is an expensive procedure, though.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#106:1>
Mussels are often the most contaminated, as their feeding behavior
is less selective than that of oysters.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#107:1>
Poisoning symptoms: numbing of the lips, fingertips and toes and
mild respiratory problems. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#108:1>
What to do?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#109:1>
One might normally suppose that some method could be developed by
which the dinoflagellates can be neutralized or removed from the water.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#110:1>
Dr. Hallegraef is skeptical about this.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#111:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Even if this can be done, &rdquo; </quote> he says,
<quote> &ldquo; it will be futile. <X>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#X112:1>
The dormant stage of the organism, a spore or cyst, will remain in
the sediment on the floor of the ocean, ready to germinate as soon as the
conditions--a warm temperature and nutrients--are right.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#X113:1>
They can stay dormant up to 20 or 30 years. &rdquo; </quote> </X>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#114:1>
Hibernation, then, enables the dinoflagellate to exist from
bloom to bloom.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#115:1>
Reproduction is simple: asexual--all it takes is to split in two.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#116:1>
Filipino shellfish farmers can learn from the Japanese.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#117:1>
In Japan, they study the species, learn to identify the harmful from
the nonharmful, and monitor their growth.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-030#118:1>
They watch out for any increase in the density of the blooms and
harvest their shellfish before the blooms reach dangerous proportions. </p>
