Mr President on a speck of land in the blue waters of the
Mediterranean in the Greek island of Corfu lies the grave of a young man and
on his headstone is carved the epitaph <quote> I want nothing I fear nothing
I am free </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#2:1:A>
And when I was in the military stockade of the dictator where I
spent almost five years of my life exacerbated by having to listen day in and
day out on radio and television to pompous and pontificating propagandists
spew forth lie after lie half truth after half truth phrases like <indig> sa
ikauunlad ng bayan disiplina ang kailangan </indig> or there is not a single
political prisoner in this country I found courage and inspiration from the
words of the great Mahatma Gandhi who said <quote> the first condition of
freedom is freedom from fear </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#3:1:A>
And it was only then and when I was able to inten internalize this
dictum that I began to realize that prison bars do not enslave a man it is
his fears that do
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#4:1:A>
Man 's most basic instinct is the instinct for survival and
corollary to that man 's greatest fear is the fear of destruction of death
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#5:1:A>
Thus it became my personal program to face the issue of dying and
the fear of death
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#6:1:A>
First I came to acknowledge that life is a matter of trade-offs and
that there were certain things in life which are so unendurable unbearable
that death or the risk of dying would be preferable
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#7:1:A>
The immortal Ninoy Aquino was able to capsulize this powerful
feeling in a single sentence when he declared <quote> I would rather die on
my feet like a man than continue to live on bended knees like a slave
 </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#8:1:A>
And it was this precept which spurred my cellmate Geny and I to go
on a hunger strike in November nineteen seventy-four to demand the release of
political prisoners and when one thousand and twenty-four detainees were
given their release on December fourth Geny and I broke our fast
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#9:1:A>
The hunger strike lasted for ten days
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#10:1:A>
And it was this belief this passion to be free that on September
thirty nineteen seventy-seven gave us the courage to risk death and undertake
a daring escape from the maximum security unit of Fort Bonifacio
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#11:1:A>
Mr President during the past several months the Filipino people
have been bombarded with half truths and outrageous lies wittingly or
unwittingly by pro-V F A propagandists
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#12:1:A>
Quarter page ads in news dailies had been paid by whose monies we
still do not know to instill fear in the Filipino people that the nation now
faces the immediate threat of an invasion by Chinese hordes from the mainland
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#13:1:A>
As proof they cited the construction of a small unsightly building
on a tiny atoll one hundred and thirty-five miles from the shores of Palawan
a building that is so small that it would be unable to contain a garrison of
more than fifty soldiers in cramped fashion
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#14:1:A>
The presence of a tiny Chinese garrison on Mischief Reef combined
with the passage by the National People 's Congress of a law declaring that
the entire South China Sea belongs to China has been utilized with a limited
amount of success I must admit to cause a number of Filipinos to support the
return of American soldiers modified by the vague and nebulous adjective
 <mention> visiting forces </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#15:1:A>
The Visiting Forces Agreement is necessary the proponents say to
operationalize the Mutual Defense Treaty of nineteen fifty-one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#16:1:A>
They insist that our soldiers need to be trained by American
soldiers in the use of the latest state-of-the-art weaponry as if the
Philippines could afford to buy destroyers and frigates and submarines and
laser-guided bombs delivered by F eighteen Hornets or F sixteen Falcons P
three Orion planes anti-submarine patrol helicopters Tomahawk cruise missiles
Hawkeye missiles and much much less an intercontinental ballistic missile or
maybe a fourth-hand aircraft carrier
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#17:1:A>
Because this is what it will take to stop a Chinese invasion or
even neutralize them in the Spratlys
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#18:1:A>
Roughly I estimate in my amateur defense way one hundred billion U
S dollars
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#19:1:A>
It is like your neighbor teaching you how to drive a Ferrari but
when you go home you have no Ferrari in your garage to drive
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#20:1:A>
The proponents have continuously and loudly alleged that the
presence of the Chinese on Mischief Reef constitutes a clear and present
danger to the free and unhampered passage of commercial ships in the area and
to the security of the East Asian region
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#21:1:A>
Even while the U S Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and
Pacific Affairs otherwise known as America 's point man in Asia Mr Stanley
Roth declared in Davo Switzerland only last February nineteen ninety-nine
that and I quote Mr Roth <quote> It is important not to overstate the
situation </quote> referring to the Spratlys dispute between Manila and
Beijing <quote> while at the same time not to underestimate the need to get
some resolution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#22:1:A>
<X> There has been a lot of publicity recently which might suggest
that freedom of navigation is at risk because of new construction by Chinese
at Mischief Reef
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#X23:1:A>
In fact the building is in no way a fundamental threat to security
 </X> </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#24:1:A>
And I repeat Mr Roth said this <quote> the building on Mischief
Reef is in fact no way a fundamental threat to security
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#25:1:A>
<X> The fact is that the United States Navy transits the region all
the time
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#X26:1:A>
It is disappointing that China chose to build </quote> he said
 <quote> it appears to be at odds with commitments they have given the
Philippines previously and certainly with a notion of resolving by peaceful
means the many disputed claims </X> </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#27:1:A>
The proponents of the V F A have continuously pounded away at us
their belief that the Mutual Defense Treaty must now be strengthened by the
approval of the V F A in order to provide our country with the security
shield that will protect us from China in spite of the fact that the Mutual
Defense Treaty does not <,> repeat not <,> contain an automatic retaliatory
clause in case the Philippines is attacked that it is in fact an empty
promise which American propagandists have used to their advantage for
forty-eight years to gain concessions from the Filipinos
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#28:1:A>
Indeed only last week the Pentagon 's equivalent of Assistant
Secretary Roth <&> break in recording </&> the Commander-in-Chief of all U S
Armed Forces in the Pacific better known as CINCPAC Admiral Dennis Blair
declared in Singapore that the V F A and I quote in his thinking it is not a
security guarantee or a big signal on the issues mentioned
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#29:1:A>
I have repeatedly maintained that the proponents of the V F A have
been making promises on behalf of the Americans and have been exaggerating
the danger posed by a tiny Chinese garrison at Mischief Reef or by the
commitment of the United States to come to the defense of our country if and
when attacked
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#30:1:A>
It would seem to me and to many that if the proponents of the V F A
utilized these arguments in America they would be laughed out of the United
States Senate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#31:1:A>
The officials of various departments who testified during the
hearings have maintained that because the Philippines has not had to invoke
the Mutual Defense Treaty in the past is proof enough that the M D T has been
effective and one official even said that even if the Philippines is able to
bluff the Chinese that the possibility alone I 'm not talking about
probability but possibility alone that the U S might might come to our
assistance because of the fact that we have the M D T should be enough to
deter the Chinese from engaging in more aggressive actions in the Spratlys
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#32:1:A>
Well the candid comments of Admiral Blair threw off any pretense of
U S intentions although Ambassador Hubbard was quick to deny that uhm that
Admiral Blair did not say what Admiral Blair indeed said
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#33:1:A>
And how else do we did we expect Ambassador Hubbard to react
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#34:1:A>
Admiral Blair up to now has not corrected his statement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#35:1:A>
Last week in my <foreign> <?> turno en contra </?> </foreign> I
like the small boy in the Hans Christian Andersen tale declared the Emperor
has no clothes
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#36:1:A>
Today as I listen to the various explanations of votes by our
distinguished colleagues I could not but come to the conclusion that the
Chinese know we are bluffing that we know that the Chinese know we are
bluffing but that we hope that the Filipino people do not know that the
Chinese know that we are bluffing about the M D T
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#37:1:A>
But as a philosopher once said <quote> in war truth is the first
casualty </quote> and since the proponents of the V F A have engendered in
our people the fear of impending war with China all logic reason common sense
and balanced judgment have been thrown out the window
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#38:1:A>
The problem I have always maintained is not whether we should
operationalize the M D T but whether America has a real commitment to our
defense
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#39:1:A>
The problem also is whether V F A costs too much in terms of our
national dignity and honor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#40:1:A>
The debate is not over the need to maintain security alliances with
friendly countries like the United States or Australia or the United Kingdom
or France or Canada but to maintain such alliances while maintaining our
self-respect
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#41:1:A>
It is the responsibility of the Senate comprised of only
twenty-three men and women elected at large to play a countervailing role to
the Executive Department in matters of treaties
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#42:1:A>
It is our role to play the bad cop to the Executive 's good cop
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#43:1:A>
I possess some amount of sympathy for the members of the Executive
Department who have been bullied by almighty America into ratifying such a
one-sided Agreement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#44:1:A>
The pressure must have been tremendous
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#45:1:A>
Our pending structural adjustment loans from the World Bank the
approvals of the I M F for our financial plans loans from the Asian
Development Bank our sugar and garment quotas must have been bashed over the
heads of our leaders and as Lyndon Baines Johnson so aptly described his
philosophy <quote> if you 've got them by the balls their minds and hearts
will follow </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#46:1:A>
And I guess our decision is now limited to two options to either
have our balls fondled by the Americans or crushed by the Chinese
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#47:1:A>
But as the revered nationalist and former light of the Senate Jose
W Diokno once asked <quote> if we have to give up our virtue can we not at
least check if their dollar is counterfeit </quote> I had also asked the
Senate not as an eleventh hour excuse to derail the V F A but to protect our
children in Pampanga and Zambales
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#48:1:A>
Our distinguished colleague the Senator from Batangas and Antique
has already articulated the heartaches and the miseries that toxic and
hazardous wastes have caused are causing and will continue to cause poor
families most of them already victims of Mount Pinatubo 's <indig> lahar
 </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#49:1:A>
Over twenty thousand families have lived in the <?> Cabcom </?> 
evacuation center for an average of one to four years
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#50:1:A>
And considerable harm from toxic and hazardous wastes had been done
to them especially to pregnant women
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#51:1:A>
The Americans did not even inform the Philippine authorities of
potential risk of water contem contamination
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#52:1:A>
If they had only warned us many deaths could have been prevented
and so many lives would not have been destroyed because we would not have
allowed the evacuees to occupy that particular area in Clark
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#53:1:A>
Earlier the distinguished Senator from Laguna from Cagayan I 'm
sorry repeated the final lines of our National Anthem and perhaps in honor of
all past present and future victims of toxic wastes especially the innocent
children we should rephrase our Anthem <indig> Silang mamatay nang dahil sa
Kano </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#54:1:A>
In concurring in the ratification of the V F A we are waiving the
rights of our children to a happy and healthy life in the future
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#55:1:A>
The Senate can still prevent this by using the V F A to get the
United States of America to own up to their moral responsibility to make
things right and to prevent more children being born mentally retarded with
physical deformities with cancer leading to a life of misery and a painful
death
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#56:1:A>
Let not the U S continue to bluff us into believing that trade and
investment will suffer if the V F A is not concurred in by the Senate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#57:1:A>
It was after the bases were closed in nineteen ninety-two that
investments in our country grew by leaps and bounds
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#58:1:A>
Nobody in the Senate has so far disputed those statistics
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#59:1:A>
The American businessman my friends like any investor will go
anywhere where he can make a profit regardless of what his government
policies are
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#60:1:A>
In America my friends it is the businessmen and not the politicians
who dictate policy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#61:1:A>
I have read much researched much studied much analyzed much in
preparing for the V F A debates
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#62:1:A>
I have tried to perform my duty as a Senator of the Republic as God
gives me the light to see that duty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#63:1:A>
I wish to express my appreciation to the leadership of this chamber
who have conducted proceedings with fairness dignity and decorum
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#64:1:A>
And also to the distinguished sponsors and co-sponsor who have been
kind patient and understanding I 've been privileged to interact with all of
you
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#65:1:A>
But I must vote <mention> no </mention> to a one-sided agreement
that is an insult to our national honor and which will remove from us the one
single trump card that will save thousands of children in Pampanga and
Zambales
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#66:1:A>
As a statesman once said <quote> I would rather lose in a cause
that I know someday will triumph than to triumph in a cause that I know
someday will fail </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#67:1:A>
It is obvious to us that the concurrence of the Senate in the
ratification of the V F A is inevitable
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#68:1:A>
And if we were to take the path of least resistance we may perhaps
follow the advice of a former Secretary of Foreign Affairs who said <quote> 
If rape is inevitable relax and enjoy it </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#69:1:A>
But Mr President the Senate has no right to make that answer on
behalf of Filipino women and children
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#70:1:A>
And I shall not relax and enjoy I shall continue to fight for our
people especially women and children for the right to live lives of dignity
and good health if not happiness
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#71:1:A>
The Scottish philosopher Thomas Carlyle was once asked by one of
his students <quote> If you could encapsulate the wisdom of the ages in one
sentence how would that sentence read </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#72:1:A>
Carlyle thought for a few minutes and he answered <quote> I cannot
give it to you in one sentence but I can give it to you in four and they are
one whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad two the bee pollinizes
the flower that it steals the honey from three the wheels of justice grind
exceedingly slow but they grind exceedingly fine and four it is only when it
gets dark enough that you can see the stars </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#73:1:A>
And at this beginning of another benighted period in our country 's
history I shall take time from now on to peer up into the heavens to look at
the stars because to me they are the Filipino children
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-033#74:1:A>
Thank you Mr President </I>
