<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#1:1:A>
Thank you very much Mrs Chavez
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#2:1:A>
Fellow victims of both man-made and natural calamities <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#3:1:A>
I 'm not very much really for uh monologue I 'm more in favor of dialogue
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#5:1:A>
But let me set the tone before we dialogue <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#6:1:A>
We cannot even begin charting the future of this country unless we look at it in the long view in a global perspective
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#7:1:A>
Because mark my words well within your lifetime you will see a borderless world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#8:1:A>
This was experimented after the second world war in Europe and now you have this very efficient unit <,> European Economic Community that will soon extend from the Iberian Peninsula all the way to Siberia
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#9:1:A>
The United States of America cognizant of how potent this economic community will be and how efficient it will be is not only opening north to Canada in spite of all the labor protestations they 're opening south to Mexico
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#10:1:A>
And very soon you will see an an American economic community from the North to the South Pole
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#11:1:A>
Here in the Philippines we sit in the middle of half of the world 's potential market because in the Asia-Pacific we have half of the population of the world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#12:1:A>
We sit in the middle of the fastest growing economies in the world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#13:1:A>
And so <,> the significance of a borderless world the efficiency of mass production <,> economies of scale with all the modern technologies that are coming into place will accelerate and will put us at a very good vantage point
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#14:1:A>
It is at this point in time therefore that we should identify the areas where we enjoy the best comparative advantages and we have many of that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#15:1:A>
If Cebu has succeeded although we are nowhere near where we want to be it is because the Cebuanos have identified this at a very early stage perhaps out of necessity because among the eight major islands we are the poorest and we are the most densely populated per square kilometer
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#17:1:A>
If I succeeded in doing anything in Cebu it 's putting it together and accelerating it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#18:1:A>
But by far the credit goes to our people our brothers and sisters in Cebu and very little of it will I admit was my doing <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#19:1:A>
But before we can join this <,> community of nations and benefit from the advantages of open borders we have to get our house in order <,> first
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#20:1:A>
And there are certain rules without exception that we must begin to realize
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#21:1:A>
Let me begin <,> with Cebu it is the only major island where the demography has moved from agriculture to services and manufacturing
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#22:1:A>
Because this rule is without exception <,> nations where the greatest number of hands are dedicated to the production of food are the nations least capable of feeding themselves
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#23:1:A>
Think about it the U S A the most mature economy in the world only has three percent of its population dedicated to the production of food and yet they feed not only all of America but a lot of people in Russia in China in Japan all over the world as well
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#24:1:A>
But to say that we must industrialize is not to say that we should abandon agriculture
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#25:1:A>
Because the only source <,> of industry is land
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#26:1:A>
It accelerates and increases the efficiency of agriculture when a nation industrializes
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#27:1:A>
And it frees many hands when you 're efficient in the manufacturing sector to go into the higher ends of income which would be services
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#28:1:A>
To illustrate it is a bad example but it 's the only one I have in my pocket
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#29:1:A>
To illustrate <,> these are nineteen eighty ballpark figures but I 'm sure they are not far from where it is today
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#30:1:A>
In this pack of cigarettes it is an agricultural product because it 's tobacco but in this pack there are four cents worth of tobacco <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#31:1:A>
Packaging the paper the filter the paint whatever is eighteen cents
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#32:1:A>
And advertising to sell this product is twenty-two cents
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#33:1:A>
It 's a bad product and yet it sells
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#34:1:A>
But what am I trying to say
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#35:1:A>
If the Philippines is to become only an agricultural country and the manufacturing or the processing and the selling will be done by other countries and they source their raw material from here all we get is the four cents <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#36:1:A>
You know I 've often wondered uh when I was in the private sector I 'm only I 'm only in government for three years why the Philippines a democracy a free market economy very high literacy rate we certainly have the human infrastructure was so far behind left so far behind by our other democratic countries in the globe <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#37:1:A>
See to me I view government function as nothing but a continuous process of sourcing of funds and application <,> of funds
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#38:1:A>
And when I made an analysis I found out two things
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#39:1:A>
One that our so-called democracy is a myth <,,> democracy only in form but certainly not <,> in substance
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#41:1:A>
Let me explain
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#42:1:A>
First let us go to the sourcing of funds
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#43:1:A>
Government has three visible sources and one invisible source
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#44:1:A>
The visible sources are income or taxes derived from income
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#45:1:A>
We have beautiful laws
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#46:1:A>
They 're almost as beautiful as the most perfect form of government the communist system
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#47:1:A>
But it doesn't work
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#48:1:A>
For the same reason communism doesn't work the human factor the human element
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#49:1:A>
Our laws are the most socially equitable
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#50:1:A>
The higher your income the more you 're supposed to pay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#51:1:A>
You have the brackets and the formulas but what 's happening in actuality
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#52:1:A>
The ones who are carrying the burden of income taxes are the salaried class and the ones who should pay the most really pay the least
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#54:1:A>
Because of the human element or factor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#55:1:A>
In other words it is beautiful only on paper
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#56:1:A>
So we go to the next <,> sourcing of funds and that is taxes derived from imports or duties and customs
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#57:1:A>
While it is a good way of sourcing funds there is a cap or a limit to what we can charge to this
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#58:1:A>
Initially it is a good protection to the local industries in order for them to be able to grow and compete
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#59:1:A>
But in excess it is an encouragement for inefficiency and in the end it is the consumer that suffers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#60:1:A>
So there are pluses and minuses in the sourcing of your money for government from income from import
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#61:1:A>
And so we go to the next which is the big controversy now the income from consumption
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#62:1:A>
This may not be the most socially equitable but the theory here is that when it is taxed from consumption the more you consume the more you pay and it does discourage waste in consumption
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#63:1:A>
And you have seen how gasoline consumption in the Philippines plunged by twenty-five percent when they upped the price and you must remember oil is a product we don't produce locally
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#64:1:A>
This is a very controversial issue but I stand publicly and squarely with Jess Estanislao against all the politicians who want to take the position of what is popular
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#65:1:A>
And what I say is this if they take back position because they don't understand economics that 's bad but if they take that position because they understand economics but they want to take the popular stand that 's even worst
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#66:1:A>
And this I will try to illustrate to you the necessity in the next area by comparing it to the next area of sourcing of funds <,> the invisible tax what I call the criminal tax of borrowing the money and deficit spending
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#68:1:A>
You see you we have a budget today of three hundred billion pesos
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#69:1:A>
It is anticipated that government will collect only one hundred and eighty billion in taxes
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#70:1:A>
So the government will have to borrow a hundred and twenty billion to be able to cover the budget
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#71:1:A>
We have these three visible taxes one the invisible
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#72:1:A>
Now let me illustrate to you why to me this is a criminal tax
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#73:1:A>
You see when government goes into deficit spending every man woman and child in this country pays for it equally including the unborn
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#74:1:A>
When I used to go to school and a few professors here as well we used to pay ten centavos for a Coca-Cola you remember this
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#75:1:A>
Now now you guys and gals there are paying five pesos maybe for it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#76:1:A>
That four ninety is the tax you are paying now for fiscal irresponsibility overspending by government in those years where you were not even born yet and you are paying for it now <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#77:1:A>
Now <,> when you say and demonstrate to bring down the prices of fuel and make uh you will of course note that none of those were in the EDSA revolution these two groups
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#78:1:A>
But when you go around are you really doing the poorest of the poor a favor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#79:1:A>
You know these are special interest groups transportation groups labor groups <foreign> etcetera </foreign> yes they consume some some of that oil but who speaks for the native in Mount Pinatubo who never consumed a drop of that oil
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#80:1:A>
Who speaks for the jobless who don't need transportation rides to jobs because they have no jobs
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#81:1:A>
Who speaks for the farmer who hardly consumes that fuel
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#82:1:A>
And that is the greatest mass of this country and if it is not sourced from <,> consumption then everyone pays equally as you are paying for it now for something that was spent even before you were born
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#83:1:A>
And that is the equation 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#> So they 're barking at the wrong tree
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#84:1:A>
Because where we should be barking is towards Congress and the administration and I say not only this but all administrations past have been irresponsible fiscally because of deficit spending
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#85:1:A>
That is the area that we should eliminate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#86:1:A>
Let me at this point go therefore after discussing with you the sourcing of funds of the national government to the area of application of funds
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#87:1:A>
Why do we need such a huge budget of three hundred billion pesos
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#88:1:A>
I think this is where the biggest defect is and this is where the demonstrations should be loudest <,> in the government 's inability to apply those funds efficiently
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#90:1:A>
Let me begin by the fact that government is involved in a lot of businesses and interventions into our economy where they have no business being there
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#91:1:A>
Philippine Airlines bankrupt
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#92:1:A>
You know you 'd have to pay the buyer money to take Philippine Airlines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#93:1:A>
Fertilizer plants that lose seven billion hotels and so on all these investments
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#94:1:A>
<&> break in the recording </&> you know it is not <&> break in the recording </&> government involve itself in areas where the private sector are more efficient <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#95:1:A>
In <&> break in the recording </&> privatize to the extent possible what now the government is doing including education
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#96:1:A>
Because it is proven that private education has had much much more quality and is much much more efficient <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#97:1:A>
Second local autonomy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#98:1:A>
You know what I call imperial Manila want to hold on to those powers and to that money as if their dear lives depended on it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#99:1:A>
I do not want to impute malice
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#100:1:A>
But let us just say that if they wanted to construct two school rooms instead of one in the <indig> barangays </indig> in Cebu if they just gave those <indig> barangays </indig> the money for the same amount of money they could probably build two or three more rooms than they are doing it now when it is centrally handled by the D P W H
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#101:1:A>
Again this is human nature
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#102:1:A>
They are never going to see or use those roads those water systems those schoolhouses and so they couldn't care less that 's just a piece of paper in front of them
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#103:1:A>
I can give you a million examples
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#104:1:A>
But what we did in Cebu is we just in case of national highways I just threw out D P W H
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#105:1:A>
You know <,> when I came to office they had already awarded the Cebu South Link that would have linked us to Tagbilaran Bohol and uh Dumaguete Negros with a beautiful highway so that we could have expanded our uh our industries to those areas because distance is relative to time travel and cost of travel
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#106:1:A>
The bidding was in nineteen eighty-six
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#107:1:A>
To this day we 're nineteen ninety-one the accomplishment is less than thirty percent
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#108:1:A>
By the same token the province of Cebu had an a cementation project longer stretch in the west coast and in the north theirs was asphalt ours was cement we bidded this in March of nineteen eighty-nine in March of nineteen ninety total completion
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#109:1:A>
You know it 's not just the cost our cost will probably be only a third of what it will cost the national government when they finally if they finally finish that project
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#110:1:A>
The opportunities lost is what is more expensive
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#111:1:A>
In other words the economic activity that would have occurred if this highway were to have been completed linking the richest agricultural island in the republic to the number one industrial island
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#112:1:A>
So I won't give you any more examples I think that is quite enough but before you go to sleep let me tell you let me break this with a joke
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#114:1:A>
You know this professor from University of La Salle is very fond of experiments
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#115:1:A>
And uh one day he caught a grasshopper right out there where you have your grass and experimented on a grasshopper 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#> He put it on the table and ordered it to jump so the grasshopper jumped
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#117:1:A>
Takes the grasshopper removes one leg puts it on a table he orders it again jump 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#118:1:A>
Lopsided but it still jumped
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#119:1:A>
Takes it he removes the last leg from the grasshopper he puts it on the table and he orders it to jump jump 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#120:1:A>
Of course it wouldn't jump
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#121:1:A>
So prognosis he writes in his book <quote> after you remove two legs from a grasshopper it suffers from hearing impairment </quote> <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#122:1:A>
These are the solutions that our government has been giving us from time immemorial <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#123:1:A>
You know <,,> to me even how difficult the situations are you can always find a way to veer away from the normal and if there are any people who have succeeded in doing this the Cebuanos have
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#124:1:A>
We have pretended now there is no national government and we 're proceeding on our own full steam
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-028#> Let me show you a few transparencies on how we perform after we gained six basic freedoms 

 </I>
