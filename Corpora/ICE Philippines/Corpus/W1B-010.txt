Dear Presy,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#3:1>
Your fax message came in bits and pieces as we were having
problems with connections here.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#4:1>
It is the rainy season and the telephone lines are &ldquo; crackling.
&rdquo;

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#5:1>
Better to shout at one 's neighbors to pass on the news.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#6:1>
However with a pair of scissors and some tape I was able to
reconstruct and pass on the good news to Dr. Carmen Beduya, the dean. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#7:1>
1. The four of you are arriving Sept. 3 ( Wed).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#8:1>
2. We have four <foreign> curriculum vitae </foreign> and the four
outlines of presentations.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#9:1>
3. Thursday Sept. 4 A.M. Tish, P.M. Isagani - - Eng/Lit; Friday Sept.
5 A.M. Presy - Ed. Management; Saturday Sept. 6 A.M. P.M. Virgie - - Legal
Management.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#10:1>
4. Dr. Beduya thinks a presentation in Pilipino would benefit us
most.

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#11:1>
Is Isagani 's presentation on English Lit.; can he have an input
on teaching/writing/researching Pilipino, <foreign> etc. </foreign>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#12:1>
This could be at 4:00 P.M. Wednesday the 3rd. or morning of the 5th
Friday.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#13:1>
This is besides the Thursday Lit. input. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#14:1>
We are presuming Isagani arrives with you; and, will leave on the
2:15 plane for Cebu on the 5th as indicated. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#15:1>
5. All we need from this end is to send you the number of people
attending the sessions.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#16:1>
6. We have accommodations in the Brothers ' house.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#17:1>
The bathrooms are at the end of the corridors, so some may want to
bring bathrobes.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#18:1>
Bring soap & toilet articles; we will provide the rest.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#19:1>
7. There will be no grade school teachers at Tish 's and Isagani 's
talks on the 4th as requested.

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#20:1>
I think that covers everything.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#21:1>
I will need a quick response on whether Isagani is willing to give
that extra presentation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#22:1>
Hope your weekly &ldquo; monthly &rdquo; no-day group meetings
are a success.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#23:1>
The next time I write it will be by computer.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#24:1>
Judith Aldaba sent us a set of 40 used ones and we took two for the
community.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#25:1>
As usual Judith did a good job - - the machines <del> one word </del>
were cleaned and repaired before shipment and we have ready-to-use sets. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#26:1>
Best regards to all. </p>

Dear Presy,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#30:2>
Thanks for your FAX note.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#31:2>
Things are settling down as we go into the 2nd semester.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#32:2>
<del> PSIA </del> PAISAA events at all levels are the distractions
this month.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#33:2>
After that it will be the <foreign> Fiesta </foreign> on Dec. 8 and
then Christmas activities.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#34:2>
We plan to have an Advent liturgy on Monday Dec. 1. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#35:2>
An ex-freshman coed who dropped out last month to get a job in
Manila was raped and stabbed to <del> det </del> death this week.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#36:2>
Details a bit sketchy, but it seems a boyfriend drug addict didn't
want her to leave and he is now the prime suspect.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#37:2>
They are looking for him.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#38:2>
It happened at her house while the whole family was out. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#39:2>
I will arrive in Manila on Dec. 19 ( Friday), same flight you
took.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#40:2>
Will proceed to Greenhills so I can deliver the crabs & shrimps at my
sister 's place.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#41:2>
Will see you at South Gate DLSU 11:00 a. m. on the 20th ( as
suggested in your fax message). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#42:2>
We had to let <@> Johnny </@> the houseboy go; among others, we
lost brand new towels - - remember we were talking about these.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#43:2>
Best regards. </p>

Dear Shrimp and Crab Convert,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#47:3>
Thanks for your letter.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#48:3>
The newsletter was timely as we are drafting our written stand.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#49:3>
Next week we are holding teach-in sessions on campus, a plebiscite,
and on the 29th, a march through the city.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#50:3>
The 29th is the first day of congress in Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#51:3>
Looks like the other schools and Christian Churches are following - -
if not us, the Bishop next door. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#52:3>
I am afraid Ozamiz will be blamed for high-blood pressure cases
in Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#53:3>
I have brought kilos of crabs and shrimps to my sister and she is
making new friends and meeting long-lost relatives as a result.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#54:3>
People claim our seafood tastes better than Manila 's fare.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#55:3>
Please note, as acting tour and travel guide, that our seafood is
seasonal - - you may disappoint your clients.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#56:3>
We have the Beatrice and Asian Hotels, the latter good enough for Ina
Raymundo and Donna Cruz. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#57:3>
I gave a note to Loquias, the research director and Carmen says
she will follow-up for a reply.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#58:3>
Following our last minute conversation, I did inform her not to
publish anything until we hear from the four of you - - hence my note to
Presy saying, <quote> &ldquo; Please send text or summary or outline of your
presentation.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#59:3>
Dr. Loquias needs those ( to be published). &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#60:3>
I will have to send a researcher to Iligan to answer you re Maria
Cristina.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#61:3>
But I think the original falls we saw from the rooftop of the
original power plant, was named after <mention> Maria Cristina </mention> , a
Spanish Queen or Princess ( during the time of President Quirino). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#62:3>
Wistful thinking: In the beginning I kept talking about the
trimestral system and its pros and cons.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#63:3>
Now I am finding out I am averaging only 14 weeks of class meetings a
semester here.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#64:3>
There are many interruptions - - college weeks, Church feasts,
orientation days, sports/intramurals, <foreign> etc. </foreign>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#65:3>
No program is less than 3 hours long.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#66:3>
If liturgies work we will all be sanctified soon. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#67:3>
We are holding off on the internet.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#68:3>
Misamis U. the rival took the first plunge and got some p. r. mileage
out of it and now they are finding it too costly.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#69:3>
I found an individual willing to rent lines by the hour and we may go
that way if I find only 5 or 6 professional users in the college.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#70:3>
Our students are already subscribing to him; computers are in his
office and so you avoid the problem w/ modems and PLDT local lines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#71:3>
This week the rains have come back w/ a vengeance.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#72:3>
Phone lines down.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#73:3>
The grade school kids are enjoying p. e. <&> =physical education </&>
- - w/ mud puddles an added attraction.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#74:3>
Not to be outdone, the college held a 3-day intramurals activity.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#75:3>
There was a 5-hour program that included a beauty contest ( you would
have banned this at DLSU).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#76:3>
I will not describe the attire as there was not much to describe.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#77:3>
We signalled the start of hostilities by singing St. Francis ' hymn
on Peace! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#78:3>
Finally, this is <indig> Lakas </indig> country.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#79:3>
There is peace by Mindanao standards; no Muslim insurgency and no
refugees from troubled areas of the island.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#80:3>
That was not true under Cory or Marcos.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#81:3>
So there is soul searching among those reconciling their faith to and
loyalty to country.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#82:3>
Most here are civil servants.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#83:3>
Say hello to all. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#84:3>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#87:4>
Dear Tish,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#88:4>
Thanks for the two books.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#89:4>
I will give these back in December.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#90:4>
The other one you gave me Presy will return to you together w/ this
letter.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#91:4>
I struggled through and did not appreciate it until the last hundred
pages.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#92:4>
I think it 's clever.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#93:4>
But I just about gave up and was ready to retreat to Chaucer and
company - - if that book is what modern civilization is about. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#94:4>
We had a big crowd of PHILSCUF reps and offered them the usual:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#95:4>
brownouts for those who missed the Cory era;

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#96:4>
walks from hotel to conference room in school;

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#97:4>
a program and supper - - the speeches and dance number by faculty;

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#98:4>
cancelled flights - - they were not impressed by the boat ride from
Cebu. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#99:4>
All in all memories of Ozamiz they will have for a long time.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#100:4>
Gave your proposal to Carmen via her secretary.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#101:4>
And also the journal article. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#102:4>
I have finally convinced Lita Quebengco to come ( February?) and
give input on research.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#103:4>
From what you know of her background and work and our situation
here, what do you suggest.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#104:4>
What particular area on research should she concentrate on in her
presentation.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#105:4>
Your suggestions will be of much help - - this will be our first
experience w/ Lita. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#106:4>
The weather is clearing a bit so the crabs may arrive in Manila
this evening.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#107:4>
There are 18 PHILSCUF people praying all morning.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#108:4>
They don't want to miss their weekend in Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#109:4>
Thanks for everything again.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#110:4>
Till December. </p>

Dear Tish,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#114:5>
I just finished replying to Virgie who received our MOA.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#115:5>
Thanks for your letter of the 15th.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#116:5>
The next time Virgie writes please add a second stamp from your
school mission fund so the message gets to us in less than 10 days. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#117:5>
Our PAASCU visit has been put off 6 months ( now July 1998)
because there are many schools and not enough accreditors, it seems.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#118:5>
Carmen is withholding the news until after all reports are in.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#119:5>
She is glad for the extra time as there are unfinished cleanup and
repair work at physical facilities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#120:5>
Bro. Greg tells me we made a mistake in ordering the crabs from
Tangub City.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#121:5>
The supplier billed at Manila prices ( &peso;270) when the local
ones, though smaller, cost only &peso;170 to &peso;180.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#122:5>
Those are October pre-inflation prices. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#123:5>
( A sideline: The Archbishop just called to tell me we can now
hear the Church programs clearly ( and possibly w/ more volume); he spent
&peso;80,000 for 4 new speakers, one facing our house, as preparations for
the Dec. 8 <foreign> fiesta </foreign> go into high gear.)

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#124:5>
Earplugs may be considered Christmas items. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#125:5>
Meanwhile, Iligan has their PAASCU visit today & yesterday.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#126:5>
When the team arrived, Thursday was suddenly declared a Muslim
holiday, but Bro. Jimmy kept the high school students in. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#127:5>
I informed Carmen about cancellation of plans for seminar.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#128:5>
I think one difficulty is they tend to make all teachers attend
seminars and fail to invite those from other schools.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#129:5>
So unless they cancel all other activities, seminars are not held.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#130:5>
Will invite Lita using your input.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#131:5>
I hope something can be worked out. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#132:5>
Please forward this note to Jo Bago.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#133:5>
I think she was w/ us here at PHILSCUF ( now PHILCUA). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#134:5>
Finished your first book ( excellent light reading) and am
enjoying the second one - - plots galore, Saddam Hussein the expected
villain, politics at the White House and Tom Clancy 's <foreign> critique
</foreign> of the U. S. Constitution and liberal Supreme Court cleverly
disguised as character opinions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#135:5>
Finally, as a celibate who has to teach religion to college
seniors, my advice on matrimony is: have a dress rehearsal the day before,
videotape and cameras and all, a supper for a small group of 30, and then
elope.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#136:5>
The money saved by not entertaining 200 guests could be given to the
Church or your <foreign> Alma Mater </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#137:5>
So far no one has followed my advice. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#138:5>

Dear Virgie,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#142:6>
Please note the letterhead.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#143:6>
This indicates I have finally cleaned out the old boxes from the old
days.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#144:6>
Received your letter today re the MOA.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#145:6>
Thanks for the suggestions and especially on part 2, though we have
not entered into negotiations with the Chamber.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#146:6>
We are giving them the draft as our proposal for a general
agreement.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#147:6>
Reason: it is the only way we can deal with individual businesses
later.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#148:6>
Are you saying we should now propose doing part 2 for them, as basic
to any further research on individual companies? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#149:6>
Yes, I have changed the luncheon date to the 22nd December as
you suggested.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#150:6>
May I know where this will be as I am coming from Greenhills on that
day.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#151:6>
The 23rd is not a free day for me. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#152:6>
Thanks for conducting a towel investigation.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#153:6>
This is now on the national level.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#154:6>
Actually, if you and Presy had not come a second time, we would
never have known.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#155:6>
It 's a typical religious house classic: one thought that the other
two got extra towels for their own use, <foreign> etc </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#156:6>
After you left the second time we had a search for clean towels as
there were visitors arriving the following day.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#157:6>
After the usual exchange of <quote> &ldquo; I thought you took them.
&rdquo; </quote> , everything fell into place.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#158:6>
Occasionally I find out I am missing something from my desk drawer,
closets, <foreign> etc. </foreign> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#159:6>
We are installing metal detectors before your next visit. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#160:6>
<foreign> El Ni&ntilde;o </foreign> has been kind to us.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#161:6>
We have clear days to dry the laundry and rains in the evening and
sometimes early morning.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#162:6>
I have 66 and 68 in my two senior Christian morality classes.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#163:6>
At this time of the year, absences due to cholera, chicken pox and
diarrhea are common - - whole boarding houses w/ poor water supply. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#164:6>
Region X CHED sent us the princely sum of &peso;86,000 and a
must-do-by Dec. 31 letter for our connection to Internet.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#165:6>
So next time you can save on &peso;4 stamps!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#166:6>
I do better by waiting for travellers passing through.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-010#167:6>
This letter will be carried by Bro. Jude Reyes who is going to
Thailand on Dec. 9. </p>
