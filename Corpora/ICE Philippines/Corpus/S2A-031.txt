<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#1:1:A>
<&> missing words microphone not on </&> To be here although I must say I dreaded the thought of having to face uh language experts uh one reason being that uh I 'm not at all an expert
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#2:1:A>
In fact somebody one of the faculty members of U P <unclear> 1 word </unclear> said you have arrived you are now speaking before the Linguistic Society of the Philippines 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#3:1:A>
She probably knows what sort of grades I got from the English Department <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#4:1:A>
Uh uhm the other reason uh as I said I 'm a chemist I 've never written anything on language
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#6:1:A>
And third as you probably know this is a very highly emotionally-charged issue and it 's like entering the lion 's den
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#7:1:A>
Uhm <,> when I was Assistant to the President of the University of the Philippines uh a few years back just before I became Commissioner of the Commission on Higher Education uh President Javier gave me an assignment and that is to advise him on all the science and technology activities of the University
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#8:1:A>
He tried also to give me another assignment and that is to work with the <,> uh <,> linguists in the U P to put together a language program
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#9:1:A>
Okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#10:1:A>
I said uh Emil uh I I never retreat from work I I you know I work very hard uh I 've never refused my President whoever it was Angara Abueva and now you I 've never refused
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#13:1:A>
But this time please this is one job I don't want to do
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#14:1:A>
Okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#15:1:A>
So you can understand
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#16:1:A>
Now the only reason I 'm here is because Brother Andrew wrote me a little note and since I have worked with Brother Andrew for a long time and he has never refused me I cannot refuse him now <O> laughter </O> <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#18:1:A>
Uh may I now read my paper and uh I 've written a lot of papers uh uh but I 've never studied as hard as for this one <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#19:1:A>
I don't wanna make a fool of myself so I hope I won't today
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#20:1:A>
Uh the language as I already said the language policy in education is a highly emotionally-charged issue and has been debated over several decades apparently without a final resolution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#21:1:A>
Uhm this paper will discuss the present language policy of the Commission on Higher Education
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#22:1:A>
It must be made clear however that the CHED is still relying on the old DECS bilingual policy instituted in nineteen eighty-seven a reiteration incorporating some modifications on the one earlier issued in nineteen seventy-three
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#23:1:A>
When I received the invitation I talked with Chairman Alcala I said do we have a new policy and he said none
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#24:1:A>
So but I knew that you 'd throw me bodily out of this if if that 's all I 'm gonna tell you
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#25:1:A>
The constitutional and legal basis of the policy will be presented and the status of implementation discussed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#26:1:A>
Finally some recommendations will be made as basis of future action
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#27:1:A>
I must emphasize that these recommendations are not official CHED policy but are purely my personal views on the matter
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#28:1:A>
Some of them of course these some of these recommendations are already being done by CHED so those and those will be mentioned accordingly
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#29:1:A>
What is the constitutional and legal basis of the present policy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#30:1:A>
Uh I don't wanna bore you with this but I 'm going to read it anyway
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#31:1:A>
Section six of the nineteen eighty <.> se </.> and article whatever of the nineteen eighty-seven Constitution provides that and I quote <quote> the national language of the Philippines is Filipino <,> as it evolves it shall be further developed and enriched on the basis of existing Philippine and other languages </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#32:1:A>
I for those who haven't noticed it yet I changed the topic to <mention> language policy </mention> not <mention> English uh policy </mention> or whatever
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#33:1:A>
Furthermore it states that and I quote again <quote> for the purposes of communication and instruction the official languages of the Philippines are Filipino and until otherwise provided by law English </quote> end of quote
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#34:1:A>
Pursuant to this uh the Congress passed a law creating the National Language Commission which undertakes coordinates and promotes research for the development propagation and preservation of Filipino and other languages <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#35:1:A>
Uh <,,> the what is the present uh policy in the so called bilingual policy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#36:1:A>
I will go through from the nineteen seventy-four so we will understand how this evolved
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#37:1:A>
On June nineteen nineteen seventy-four the Department of Education Culture and Sports issued Department Order number twenty-five mandating the use of English and Filipino as media of instruction in Philippine primary and secondary schools according to a set timetable <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#38:1:A>
The purpose of the policy was for the Philippines to become and I quote <quote> a bilingual nation competent in both Filipino and English </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#39:1:A>
At that time it was Pilipino P and not Filipino F <,> Filipino F and not Pilipino P okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#40:1:A>
Domains were divided into an English domain English Communication Arts Mathematics and Science and a Pilipino domain which includes all the other subjects
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#41:1:A>
Beginning in grade one for Tagalog-speaking areas for school year nineteen seventy-four seventy-five and beginning in grade one for non-Tagalog-speaking areas in school year seventy-eight to seventy-nine
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#42:1:A>
Sorry about that it 's nineteen seventy-nine <,> <&> referring to mistake in transparency </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#43:1:A>
Note that by school year nineteen eighty-one eighty-two the shift of medium was to begin in all high schools
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#44:1:A>
However for the tertiary level institutions there was no set timetable but it said that by nineteen eighty-three eighty-four graduates from colleges and universities were supposed to be able to pass examinations in English and or Pilipino for the practice of their professions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#45:1:A>
I want to emphasize this because uh this is a major issue <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#46:1:A>
The first uh bilingual policy was based on the nineteen seventy-three Constitution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#47:1:A>
When the nineteen eighty-six Constitution was ratified the <.> Educa </.> Education Department now called DECS revised the bilingual policy which is now entitled <mention> The Nineteen Eighty-Seven Policy on Bilingual Education </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#48:1:A>
In the nineteen eighty-seven uh B E P <,> tertiary education institutions were now given a primary role in contrast to their relative freedom in the earlier version
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#49:1:A>
As I mentioned already in the earlier version they just said by such and such date the students should now be able to take the examination
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#50:1:A>
In this version now it says <quote> tertiary level institutions shall lead <,,> in the <,> continuing intellectualization of Filipino </quote> it 's now F
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#51:1:A>
<X> <quote> The program of intellectualization however shall also be pursued both in elementary and secondary levels </quote> </X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#52:1:A>
Uh by the way I must confess that up to now I 'm still confused about the P and the F
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#53:1:A>
But the way I understand it P <&> referring to Pilipino </&> is really mostly uh Tagalog and and uh F <&> referring to Filipino </&> would now incorporate more of uh the other languages and in fact has uh the the alphabet is a little bit uh includes other other letters <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#54:1:A>
How about the implementation of the policy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#55:1:A>
Again I would like to review the implementation of the policy because the recommendations I 'm going to make which as I said are purely mine are based on what we have and what we can do
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#56:1:A>
Okay I don't wanna dream and say I 'm going to do this tomorrow <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#57:1:A>
To have an assessment of the effects of the bilingual education policy instituted in nineteen seventy-four a formal summative evaluation was made which covered the period nineteen seventy-four to eighty-five
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#58:1:A>
In nineteen eighty-six the six volume technical report Bilingual Education in the Philippines prepared for the <.> Edu </.> Department of Education Culture and Sports was completed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#59:1:A>
This was done by a group of uh Brother Andrew
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#60:1:A>
The findings of the evaluation study on the implementation of the nineteen seventy-four bilingual education policy showed to what extent intents and purposes may have been realized
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#61:1:A>
Also it must have provided the context within which the subsequent policy in nineteen eighty-seven was formulated
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#62:1:A>
The above-mentioned studies by Gonzalez <foreign> et al </foreign> nineteen eighty-eight and Segovia for the tertiary level on the implementation of the nineteen seventy-four policy was made and the following is a summary of the findings
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#63:1:A>
And I must confess to Brother Andrew we practically copied what he had there <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#64:1:A>
I will not read everything uh but I will just like to point out a few things <,> and uh okay for example number one language and language use
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#65:1:A>
Pilipino is used often at that time it was still Pilipino even in classes where English is supposed to be used exclusively
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#66:1:A>
The vernacular or local language is used only rarely
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#67:1:A>
That 's one quite important uh <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#68:1:A>
Now how about achievement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#69:1:A>
Again this is very important because uh <,,> generally the students did better in Pilipino than in any other subject <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#70:1:A>
This is still true up to now
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#71:1:A>
Few students at all grade levels reach a point of being able to handle questions calling for higher cognitive functions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#72:1:A>
The inescapable conclusion is that there is a real failure in achievement and indication of real problems in the system
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#73:1:A>
However uh okay uh down the <.> bo </.> at the bottom okay <.> may </.> maybe in the middle <&> referring to the transparency </&> the influence of the number of years of B E P on achievement in subject skills is negligible
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#74:1:A>
So these are some of the more important conclusions and lastly uh you can read the rest uh later on
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#75:1:A>
The popular <.> na </.> notion that Pilipino negatively affects the learning learning of English is not borne out by the data
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#76:1:A>
Correlations of test scores in Pilipino and English with test scores in the three content areas <indig> Araling Panlipunan </indig> Mathematics and Science are all positive significant and mostly high
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#77:1:A>
So these are some of the more important conclusions uh there are more <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#79:1:A>
<indig> Pampahaba ng papel itong ginawa ni </indig> Father <.> An </.> Brother Andrew <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#80:1:A>
Uh <,,> now number four uhm okay the impact of B E P and Pilipino on test scores
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#82:1:A>
In general Pilipino test scores and B E P seemed to be good for Tagalog as uh I could imagine N C R and excellent public and private schools in learning Mathematics and Science thus favoring native Tagalogs especially those in already excellent public and private schools
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#83:1:A>
Learning was facilitated by Pilipino while English was maintained and enhanced a decided advantage of Tagalogs in urban communities <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#85:1:A>
Off the record we uh the U P uh uh I can't remember the year I was still Vice-President at the time uh gave tests in both languages okay <indig> medyo nagkamali naparami 'yung Pilipino </indig> <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#86:1:A>
When <,> when uh we looked at the results okay it turns out that all in all regions of the country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#87:1:A>
What we did was we analyzed the results okay for English only <,> uh Tagalog Pilipino only answers in English only answers in English and Pilipino only and uh uh the mixture okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#88:1:A>
We studied all three
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#89:1:A>
And we looked the ones who passed the UPCAT were those who uh passed you know uh <,> those who had higher grades in Pilipino those who had higher grades in English and the combination
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#90:1:A>
So no one was disadvantaged
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#91:1:A>
Anyway what we found out was except for N C R <,> uh those who took Pilipino had higher uh achievement in all the regions had <.> incre </.> you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#92:1:A>
We compared it with the previous prior years uh better uh <,> scores in all regions of the country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#93:1:A>
So we cannot say that uh the the Tagalogs have and I have uh I think I have a reason
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#95:1:A>
It 's because uhm in in Manila in N C R most of the most of many of the kids who take the UPCAT are from the private schools and the better high schools and they they are quite fluent in English
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#96:1:A>
So <,> that 's <,,> uhm so you know <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#97:1:A>
Uh <,,> I 'm sorry uh <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#98:1:A>
The findings forces us to rethink the basic objective the teaching and learning of Pilipino it turns out that its contribution to the learning of content subjects even in <indig> Araling Panlipunan </indig> is minimal
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#100:1:A>
These are the studies in the elementary and high school 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#101:1:A>
Oops <&> transparency falls </&> <O> laughter </O> sorry <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#102:1:A>
Uh <,,> and uh number six the transfer of English language skills between Pilipino and English
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#103:1:A>
It shows increasing dependent on Pilipino to learn English in the upper grades but decreasing dependence on English to learn Pilipino uh
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#104:1:A>
So again that 's an interesting result of the study uhm <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#105:1:A>
Another one is that the non-B E P students those who were not following the uh policy in students in grade ten scored significantly better in English I just I can imagine that there were no significant differences in Math and Science
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#106:1:A>
While B E P students scored significantly better in Social Studies higher in Pilipino a not expected result unexpected result because they were learning in Pilipino uh <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#107:1:A>
Now since our interest is really in the tertiary level
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#108:1:A>
No for English the best predictor of achievement was Science <,> for Pilipino Social Studies and English
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#109:1:A>
And for English Pilipino was significant though a minor predictor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#110:1:A>
The other thing that we learned from the UPCAT is that those who are good in Science are also good in Language and those who are good in Language are good in both <,> English or Filipino <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#111:1:A>
At the tertiary level it seems that uh B E P is not a priority at the college level considering that only slightly more than one third of the schools in the study implemented it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#112:1:A>
This was in nineteen eighty-eight okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#113:1:A>
And it was a study from seventy-four to eighty-four
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#114:1:A>
Most of the tertiary institutions that implemented it had no carefully designed comprehensive and long-range support system for its implementation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#115:1:A>
Implementation was more a perfunctory compliance than a desire to try B E P as a solution to the language-of-instruction problems in tertiary education
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#116:1:A>
Generally moderately positive the attitudes of administrators faculty members and and students at best could mean simply openness to the policy or at worst an accommodation of it through lip service
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#117:1:A>
This is tertiary level
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#118:1:A>
On the one hand respondents perceived that Pilipino can be a language of unity or national identity
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#119:1:A>
It may be pointed out however that one can be a nationalist even without communicating in Pilipino
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-031#120:1:A>
I had a long argument last night with some of my relatives about this language policy 

 </I>
