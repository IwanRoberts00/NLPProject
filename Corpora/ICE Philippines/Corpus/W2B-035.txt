<h> <bold> The millennium humbug </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#2:1>
<bold> Dean Jorge Bocobo </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#3:1>
IT 's the ultimate revenge of the nerds scenario: a world utterly
disdainful of the thick eyeglasses-clad, pocket-protected tribe becomes
totally dependent on computers that only they know how to design and program;
then, at the stroke of midnight on Dec. 31, 1999 planes start falling out of
the sky, life support systems in hospitals bog down, power plants black out,
elevators grind to a halt, cars won't start, banks and businesses are unable
to issue checks and invoices, government fails, even toasters stay on and
burn down houses. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#4:1>
The end of civilization as we know it?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#5:1>
It is, if one is to believe the worldwide media hype over the
so-called <mention> &ldquo; Millennium or Y2K ( Year 2000) computer bug.
&rdquo; </mention> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#6:1>
This refers to a problem projected to affect millions of computer
systems and networks when their internal clocks tick off the end of the
millennium next year on New Year 's Eve and the date goes from the year 1999
to 2000.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#7:1>
It seems that software programmers at the dawn of the computer age in
the ' 60s and ' 70s developed the bad habit of leaving off the <mention>
&ldquo; 19 &rdquo; </mention> in references to the year, never thinking that
their programs would still be in use by century 's end.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#8:1>
Confused by what the true year will be in 2000, those programs
represent a legacy that threatens to bring chaos to a world in which
computers have become not only ubiquitous but essential to all sorts of
operations and services. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#9:1>
Or so the doom-saying Cassandras would have us believe.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#10:1>
After all even the United States has formed a Presidential Task Force
to go after the problem, right?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#11:1>
Here in the Philippines the cries of fire in the theater are being
heard from no less than Amable Aguiluz, chair of our own President 's
Commission on the Y2K Problem and founder of the AMA computer schools.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#12:1>
Newspapers have been echoing his claim that as much as &peso;270
billion will be required to properly address the problem in the form of
programmers, consultants, managers and other experts on Y2K, and of course,
replacement costs for affected software and hardware. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#13:1>
<h> <bold> Disaster </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#14:1>
He is joined in dire warnings of impending disaster by the head
honchos of computer departments in government financial institutions like the
<indig> Bangko Central </indig> , GSIS and SSS.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#15:1>
At hearings on the matter before Congress, they have been spooking
computer-illiterate and befuddled legislators with the enormity of the
problem by pointing to the <quote> &ldquo; millions of lines of computer
code" </quote> and the thousands of banks and businesses that will be
affected.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#16:1>
Little in the way of enlightened interpolation and demands for proof
and cold hard facts about the local situation are in evidence at these
hearings.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#17:1>
Only awed silence or proddings for more gory predictions regurgitated
from the foreign press or the Internet bulletin boards. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#18:1>
The other bit of impressive <foreign> arcana </foreign> being
trotted out is to be found in the term <mention> &ldquo; embedded systems,
&rdquo; </mention> which refers to the computer chips to be found in many
common electronic appliances such as toasters, telephones, VCRs and in many
other things like power plants, automobiles, elevators, security systems,
etc.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#19:1>
Since many of these chips and the &ldquo; firmware &rdquo; associated
with them are also deemed to be &ldquo; non Y2K-compliant, &rdquo; there is
said to be danger lurking everywhere, come 2000. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#20:1>
The recent spate of doom-saying and alarmism closely tracks
Y2K-related hyperventilation in the United States, where survivalists are
urging people to stock up on foodstuffs, ammunition, fuel and to move their
families into caves, mountains or other havens safe from the coming
technological disintegration of society.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#21:1>
Since Dec. 31, 1999 will arrive on a Friday and usher in possibly the
wildest weekend in a thousand years, those convinced that Y2K spells the end
of the world are getting ready for megabyte mayhem. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#22:1>
But before you unplug your PC and exchange the Toyota for an
old-style <foreign> <it> karetela </it> </foreign> , consider a simple fact:
the most rabid Y2K prophets-of-doom are also somehow those who would profit
from gloom: software consultants, hardware resellers, computer magazine
editors and such.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#23:1>
As usual, the truth about Y2K lies somewhere between their hype and
those who might deny there is even a problem; but it is certainly farther
away from the former.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#24:1>
At least for the Philippines, our retarded growth into the computer
age may be a real blessing. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#25:1>
<h> <bold> Mainframe </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#26:1>
Some reliable facts to console the fearful are as follows.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#27:1>
Most of the problem is confined to the so-called mainframe world of
big clunky machines running ages old legacy software, like rural banks and
the government and its various institutions.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#28:1>
Here the problem is one of management, not a technical one, since the
computer clocks can be set forward to the doomsday date and the system
checked out for apocalyptic Armageddon. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#29:1>
You have a real problem if you truly rely on government computers
for anything, but that 's true with or without Y2K.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#30:1>
There 's no real problem if you use personal computers and
commercially available software, unless you inherited it all from your
grandfather 's accountant.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#31:1>
As for your toaster burning the house down just as you 're popping
champagne bottles two New Year 's Eves from now, you really need to get a
life if you 're worrying about that. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#32:1>
Another thing to consider is that the world is already up to its
ears in computer-related snafus.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#33:1>
One doesn't have to wait till the end of the millennium to suffer
from the scourges of incompetent software, non-complying firmware and errant
hardware.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#34:1>
Just visit your local bank or ATM on any given day.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#35:1>
Y2K may be just a convenient way for the information technology
department to justify bloating its staff, hiring outside consultants,
expanding its power and management covering up all the buggy, substandard
software they 've allowed to be produced. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#36:1>
Just watch, everything that goes wrong with computers after 1999
will be blamed on this Y2K humbug.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#37:1>
Something like this happened at the end of every century.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#38:1>
It 's our <foreign> <it> fin de siecle </it> </foreign> (
end-of-cycle) reincarnation of the Antichrist, wearing a pocket-protector.

<h> <bold> Caught in the Web: An unfinished history of the Internet
</bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#40:2>
<bold> Herminio L. Santos Jr. </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#41:2>
THE Internet was founded in 1969 by the Pentagon as a secure
communications system in case of a nuclear war.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#42:2>
Computers of one establishment were connected - - or networked - - to
computers in another establishment, thus providing a two-way exchange of
data. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#43:2>
But even before the cold war ended, Internet ( <mention> " the
Net &rdquo; </mention> ) not only provided information for defensive
purposes, it also provided information to anyone interested.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#44:2>
It now links more than 20 million computers in more than 100
countries, and the number is doubling every year.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#45:2>
For some, the Net is a black hole of information, viruses, hackers,
and perverts.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#46:2>
For many users though, it 's a lifeline, a living web, a highway to
the rest of the world. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#47:2>
Tapping to the Net 's vast resources can lead to a sudden
information glut.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#48:2>
Many of the information providers are individuals, and most of the
time, there 's no telling if what you find are hard facts, mere opinions, or
outright lies.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#49:2>
To list all the databases available online would use up the rest of
this column, but a few examples might give you a hint of the capabilities:
more than 4,000 medical journals with more than seven million references, the
full text of several encyclopedias, items on rap music, and more than 800
business magazines and newsletters.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#50:2>
However, news about Internet buying rights to the Pope and sleazy
X-rated graphics also abound. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#51:2>
<h> <bold> Messages </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#52:2>
In the Net, virtual communities exist.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#53:2>
You can exchange electronic mail ( e-mail) with other people.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#54:2>
Instead of calling people and getting infuriating busy signals and
voice-mail boxes you simply send them messages through the phone lines, and
you 're assured that person will have a written copy of your message.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#55:2>
You can, for example, send questions and opinions to the president of
the United States.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#56:2>
( Whether or not he answers them is another matter altogether). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#57:2>
You can also chat online, that is, send and receive messages in
the keyboard equivalent of a conversation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#58:2>
Topics range from business deals to setting up blind dates.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#59:2>
One popular news group, alt.support.depression only posts topics that
talk about - - you guessed it - - depression.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#60:2>
Subjects covered are dubious therapists, insurance claims, and
dreaded family reunions. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#61:2>
<h> <bold> Marriage </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#62:2>
This new mode of communication is brought about by the
technological advances in, and the marriage of, telephone, television, and
computers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#63:2>
All three contain the essentials for building the data network.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#64:2>
Soon, the fine line dividing the three may no longer be visible. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#65:2>
The telephone system provides a switched, two-way form of
communication that enables users to communicate with other users.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#66:2>
Television has multiple video channels with high-capacity bandwidth
necessary to carry huge amounts of information such as video and audio.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#67:2>
A new cable developed by AT&T can carry 80 gigabytes per second, or
about 2000 TV channels simultaneously per fiber.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#68:2>
Computers provide the nerve center for everything.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#69:2>
They control storage, manipulation and distribution of the data.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#70:2>
Powerful computers with speed, lots of memory, and huge amounts of
storage space are already being developed, if not already here with us. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#71:2>
The trick, however, lies not in combining these technologies, but
in making these available to the most number of people.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#72:2>
Problems arise. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#73:2>
<h> <bold> Issues </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#74:2>
First, logistics.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#75:2>
Not many telecommunication companies worldwide have the capability to
set up the satellites and the billions of kilometers of optical fibers needed
by the Net.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#76:2>
Even if the technology is here with us, the capital isn't.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#77:2>
Moreover, going online is not cheap.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#78:2>
The hardware needed ( computer, telephone line, modem, the works),
although still expensive, is fast becoming more affordable.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#79:2>
You can buy decent machines for less than US&dollar;2,000.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#80:2>
But the long distance charges are murder.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#81:2>
And once you get caught in the Net, the phone charges pile up quite
fast. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#82:2>
Fear brought about by lack of training is also a problem.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#83:2>
For most people, computers still bring images of nerdy hackers
wrestling with serpent-like technology.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#84:2>
Although some people say that the computer has virtually become just
another household appliance, it 's still not as every day and as easy to use
as a toaster.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#85:2>
Too often, computers gather dust because people don't know what to do
with them.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#86:2>
Most computers are still being used as overqualified calculators and
typewriters.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#87:2>
In schools, computers are still kept in a separate room, which is
usually called the <mention> &ldquo; computer lab, &rdquo; </mention> thus
further isolating the machines from the mainstream learning environment.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#88:2>
Computers are still thought of as an end to itself, and not as a
powerful tool for discovering other things. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#89:2>
<h> <bold> Fear </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#90:2>
Moreover, many people fear that computers will render them, and
the current technologies they 're comfortable with, useless.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#91:2>
But will computers render teachers and television obsolete?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#92:2>
Probably not.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#93:2>
Whoever thinks that students can be left caught in the Net and learn
everything by themselves is in for a rude awakening because as in any trip to
an unknown land, guides are necessary.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#94:2>
As for television, it 's a matter of taste: While some may prefer
television they can talk back to, others either simply can't afford the new
technology, or will still want current TV 's passive mode of entertainment.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#95:2>
Roles and responsibilities, however, will definitely be
redefined.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#96:2>
The Net, for example, will do to TV what TV did to radio a couple of
decades ago.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#97:2>
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#98:2>
Last November 1994, in Tokyo, I attended NHK 's 21st Japan Prize
Contest, which is a competition for educational TV programs from all over the
world.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#99:2>
In one of the seminars I attended, participants discussed television 's
future.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#100:2>
Some said that multimedia and the Information Superhighway will not
radically change television.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#101:2>
Television will remain the same dictatorial medium it has been for
the past decade: here are the programs, take it or leave it.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#102:2>
No interaction.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#103:2>
The only choice the audience makes is switching stations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#104:2>
But the contest used to have a category for educational radio
programs.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#105:2>
In 1969, Professor Schramm of Stanford University said the rapid
development of TV did not mean that radio as an educational tool has faded
away.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#106:2>
He added that TV 's popularity does not change the fact that radio
still served as one of the important educational media in any country.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-035#107:2>
In 1991, due to lack of entries, the radio category was abolished.
