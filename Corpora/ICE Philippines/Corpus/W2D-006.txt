<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-006#4:1>
The regulations that follow apply to all students who are enrolled
in the graduate schools of the University and who, upon admission, agree to

discipline, uphold order in the school, preserve the good name of the
University, and actualize its Mission Statement. </p>

The Graduate Student Handbook states common minimum requirements
across colleges, but each department/college may impose more stringent
