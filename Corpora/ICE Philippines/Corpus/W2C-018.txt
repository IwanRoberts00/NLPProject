SHARE prices soared anew yesterday, extending their winning streak
to six straight trading sessions -- a development attributed by analysts to the
return of foreign funds to the region. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#4:1>
The 30-share Philippine composite index ( PHISIX), which posted
its second-biggest single-day gain, closed 197.69 points or 10.15 percent
higher, to 2,145.70 points; the broader all-shares index rose 54.09 points,
or 9.52 percent, to 622.12 points. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#5:1>
In percentage terms, the PHISIX posted the biggest single-day rise
since September 1987 when it rose 16.06 percent to end at 818.99 points. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#6:1>
Yesterday, the PHISIX went up as high as 202.09 points to 2,150.10
points a few minutes before closing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#7:1>
Gainers outgunned decliners, 120 to 15, with 24 issues unchanged.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#8:1>
Value turnover doubled to &peso;4.57 billion as foreign punters
continued to accumulate oversold stocks. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#9:1>
Brokers said Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. 's ( PLDT)
over &dollar;1 gain in New York prompted the PHISIX to open strong, breaking
the 2,000-point resistance and then piercing through the second resistance
level of 2,100 points in early trade. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#10:1>
Buying was across-the-board with PLDT the most actively traded
stock, closing &peso;65 higher at &peso;1,110.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#11:1>
Some 657,520 shares worth &peso;711.77 million changed hands.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#12:1>
It accounted for 15.54 percent of the day 's value turnover. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#13:1>
Sapphire Securities Inc. research head Henry Ong said in an
interview that foreign fund managers are starting to accumulate blue-chip
stocks such as PLDT, Manila Electric Co. Inc. ( Meralco), San Miguel Corp.,
Ayala Land Inc., Ayala Corp. and oversold second-line issues. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#14:1>
He revealed that some foreign fund managers are covering their
short positions made last year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#15:1>
He expected the market to continue its rally before succumbing to
profit taking in the next few days. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#16:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The market has gone up so fast and investors are
expected to cash in soon, &rdquo; </quote> Ong warned. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#17:1>
Abacus Securities Corp. said in its weekly report that foreign
money may have sensed the potential value that Asian countries may offer in
the medium term on the assumption that the US economy is expected to
experience moderate growth. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#18:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The scent of the bull will last if there is a
follow-through on perceptions made earlier, and the said perception will
actually be backed by confirmations, &rdquo; </quote> Abacus reported. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#19:1>
The securities firms also said that the mood of the local market
will be generally upbeat this week despite a possible breather due to
profit-taking. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#20:1>
Last week 's climb was largely a result of the favorable
observations made by the US federal government regarding the direction of
Asia.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#21:1>
US President Clinton also announced renewed funding support for the
International Monetary Fund 's move to extend financial aid to ailing Asian
economies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#22:1>
Angping & Associates Securities Inc. research chief Gina Tan said
in an interview that foreign-fund managers are looking anew at the Asian
equities market after liquidating their stocks when the currency crisis
started last July 1997. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#23:1>
The peso was effectively devalued in July. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#24:1>
Tan said the recovery will only be confirmed if the stock market
sustains its high value turnover.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#25:1>
The market was previously trading below the &peso;1-billion level as
foreign-fund managers, citing the volatility of the financial system in the
region, refused to invest. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#26:1>
The local bourse 's rally started last week after the release of
better-than-expected economic figures for 1997.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#27:1>
Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito reported that the
expansion of the country 's gross national product slowed down to 5.8 percent
last year from 1996 's 6.9 percent while the growth of the gross domestic
product decelerated to 5.1 percent from 6.3 percent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#28:1>
Share prices of the PLDT affiliate cellular phone provider
<indig> Pilipinas </indig> Telephone Corp., rose &peso;0.55, or 15 percent,
to &peso;4.10 per share. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#29:1>
Meralco share prices continued to increase after it denied the
allegation of state-run National Power Corp. , ( Napocor) that it was
overcharging customers.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#30:1>
Its class &ldquo; B &rdquo; shares rose 17.18 percent to &peso;159

percent to &peso;100 per share. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#31:1>
All the market 's sub-indices went up with the property sector
posting the biggest gain.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#32:1>
It went up by 126 points or 15.58 percent to &peso;926 and was
followed by the bank and financial index, which rose 55 points or 12 percent
to 522.11 points. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#33:1>
Property issues that went up were Ayala Land ( 16.66 percent),
Kuok Philippines Properties Inc. ( 44.74 percent), Filinvest Land Inc. (
31.17 percent), Fil-Estate Land Inc. ( 15.35 percent) and SM Prime Holdings
Inc. ( 13.23 percent). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#34:1>
Analysts, however, advised investors to lock in on their profits
as share prices may succumb to selling pressure in the next few days.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#35:1>
However, analysts and traders said the general mood of the local
equities market will still be upbeat. </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#38:2>
SENATE Minority Leader Ernesto Maceda, still smarting from his
ouster as Senate president, is apparently on a political <foreign> vendetta
</foreign> against candidates he suspects helped depose him. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#39:2>
In a news conference, Maceda listed opposition senatorial bets
Sens. Edgardo Angara, Blas Ople, Freddie Webb and Vicente Sotto III among
those he will not support. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#40:2>
But Maceda singled out Angara, <indig> Laban ng Makabayang Masang
Pilipino </indig> ( LAMMP) vice-presidential candidate, as topping his junk
list.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#41:2>
Both conspired in the 1996 <foreign> coup </foreign> against current
Senate President Neptali Gonzales that installed Angara in that position.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#42:2>
Now Maceda suspects Angara as a principal in his own downfall.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#43:2>
Gonzales reclaimed the post from Maceda after a <foreign> coup
</foreign> supported by 17 senators two weeks ago. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#44:2>
Maceda does not see Nationalist People 's Coalition ( NPC)
founding chairman Eduardo Cojuangco supporting Angara, and since most NPC
members take the cue from Cojuangco, he believes it is unlikely that Angara
will get the backing of NPC stalwarts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#45:2>
Maceda admitted, however, another reason - - <quote> &ldquo; it
will be difficult for me to [ persuade] the rank and file of the NPC to
support Ople, Sotto and Webb. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#46:2>
Ople said in a statement, however, there was no reason for Maceda
to accuse him of treachery.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#47:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Until he ( Maceda) left as Senate president, I had
been a steadfast and loyal supporter. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#48:2>
Sotto said he had no choice but to abide by the decision of LAMMP
leaders to move against Maceda. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#49:2>
Angara debunked Maceda 's claim that LAMMP had collapsed into a
mere coalition between Angara 's <indig> Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino
</indig> ( LDP) and Vice President Joseph Estrada 's <indig> Partido ng
Masang Pilipino </indig> ( PMP). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#50:2>
<quote> &ldquo; [ The LAMMP] is still an alliance.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#51:2>
It does not impair the numerical strength of the LAMMP whether as a
coalition or a merger, &rdquo; </quote> replied Angara, because the party
remains a three-party alliance among the LDP, the PMP and the NPC. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#52:2>
At the local government level, squabblings among <indig> Lakas
</indig> - NUCD stalwarts could trigger an exodus of administration
grassroots leaders unless the party leadership finds the right formula for
selecting candidates. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#53:2>
<indig> Lakas </indig> Rep. Bonifacio Gillego of Sorsogon, a
third-termer, said the selection of candidates for local government positions
has become <quote> &ldquo; a serious problem, &rdquo; </quote> and the
disputes could erode the administration 's clout at the grassroots level.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#54:2>
In his district alone, Gillego said at least six <indig> Lakas
</indig> members are vying for his seat in the House. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#55:2>
The situation in other districts is similar and even aggravated
by the entry of the <indig> Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino </indig> into the
rainbow coalition. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#56:2>
This developed as <indig> Lakas </indig> Rep. Raul del Mar of
Cebu disclosed that many <indig> Lakas </indig> leaders in the Visayas and
Mindanao will join the camp of former Cebu governor Emilio Osme&ntilde;a once
he files his candidacy for president on February 9. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#57:2>
Del Mar himself will resign from the ruling party on that day to
campaign fulltime for Osme&ntilde;a. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#58:2>
Sen. Miriam Santiago, standard-bearer of the People 's Reform
Party, urged the Catholic Bishops ' Conference of the Philippines <quote>
&ldquo; to speak out on the candidates ' morality and political turncoatism.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#59:2>
Santiago wants the bishops to be more specific in reaction to a
CBCP statement that none of the presidential aspirants are entirely
acceptable. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#60:2>
Sen. Raul Roco, another presidential candidate, agrees, saying
the bishops are entitled to air their opinions but <quote> &ldquo; they must
specify the charges against each candidate so that the people will know what
they have against &rdquo; </quote> them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#61:2>
Santiago said a good Christian voter must know who may be
acceptable and why.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#62:2>
Voters, she said, must be aware of a concern that is admittedly
widely practiced in domestic politics--turncoatism. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#63:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Is it acceptable behavior for a candidate to
disregard completely any party affiliation or even worse, any ideological
allegiance simply because he or she can grab the opportunity to be a
candidate with the party possessing the most resources? &rdquo; </quote>
asked Santiago. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> 3 of 10 Cuneta memos forged </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#65:3>
<bold> Lenie Lectura and Joel San Juan </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#66:3>
SO, who forged the signature of Pasay City Mayor Cuneta in the
memoranda he sent to city hall which said that he would be returning to his
office after a long absence? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#67:3>
This is the question the National Bureau of Investigation ( NBI)
is now trying to answer after its findings revealed that the signature on
three of the ten memoranda was not Cuneta 's. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#68:3>
A <mention> TODAY </mention> source disclosed that the NBI
anti-graft and corruption team led by lawyer Rickson Chiong released Friday
night its finding on the authenticity of the signatures of three memoranda
allegedly signed by Cuneta. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#69:3>
The source said two of those memoranda were the ones dated
December 15 and 16, 1997. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#70:3>
<quote> &ldquo; The signature of the original specimen in the
questioned documents appear not to be made by the same person, &rdquo;
</quote> the two-page findings read. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#71:3>
The source added that the persons whose signatures appeared in
the forged memoranda will also be investigated by the NBI as to the extent of
their participation in the fraud. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#72:3>
<quote> &ldquo; Those who attested will also be investigated,
&rdquo; </quote> the source said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#73:3>
Cuneta 's wife Elaine and acting City Administrator Lourdes
Cabrido were among those who attested to the authenticity of the memoranda.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#74:3>
The source added that the NBI findings will be presented to the
city council on Tuesday. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#75:3>
Trinidad, who earlier took his oath of office as the new mayor of
Pasay City, originally submitted 10 memoranda allegedly signed by Cuneta to
the NBI to verify if Cuneta was indeed the one who signed them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#76:3>
<quote> &ldquo; These memoranda are of dubious origin.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#77:3>
[ The signatures on them] are different from the signatures of Mayor
Cuneta, &rdquo; </quote> he alleged. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#78:3>
Trinidad said Cuneta 's inability to move about freely without
help or even to hear clearly made him doubt the authenticity of the
signatures. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#79:3>
The vice-mayor elect also said that he has the support of the
city council, whose members had passed Resolution 985 S-1997, asking Cuneta
to present proof that he is physically capable to assume office again. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#80:3>
Trinidad, likewise challenged Cuneta to attend a press conference
so that every one may be free to judge if he is still lucid. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#81:3>
Cuneta, who celebrates his 88th birthday today, is again expected
to appear at the city hall today. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#82:3>
The Department of the Interior and Local Government has been
unable to enforce its position that Cuneta should sit as Pasay City mayor.

<h> <bold> Opposition against NAIA 3 gathers steam </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#84:4>
THE resistance to the construction of the Ninoy Aquino
International Airport ( NAIA) Terminal 3 yesterday gained more advocates
after six groups in Pasay City registered their support to oppose the
project. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#85:4>
Lawyer Nonoy Hilvano, founding chairman and president of Justice
for All Movement of the Philippines ( JAMP), said the six groups have been
meeting with his group in a bid to consolidate forces to take issue against
the project. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#86:4>
Hilvano identified the six groups from Pasay as <indig> Bangon
</indig> Pasay Movement ( BPM), Join Our Crusade for Progress ( JOC for
Progress), <indig> Kapitkamay </indig> Neighborhood Association ( KNA),
Luna-Harrison-Pier Drivers Association, Inc. ( LUHAPDA), residents of <indig>
Barangay </indig> Electrical Road and <indig> Barangay </indig> Pildera 2.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#87:4>
<quote> &ldquo; These groups have joined us in our struggle
against NAIA 3, &rdquo; </quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#88:4>
Based on a report from an expert 's analysis, Hilvano said that
NAIA with only one runway is not capable of accommodating the New Large
Aircraft ( NLA) due to its already optimum runway length and marginal
wingspan clearance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#89:4>
International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO) prescribes that
for airplanes with wingspan of more than 52 meters, runway-taxiway separation
distance should at least be 182.5 meter for safety considerations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#90:4>
Already, today 's model like B-747 400 series has a wingspan of
65 meters. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#91:4>
According to the same report, the runway-taxiway separation
distance for NAIA is only 150 meters.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#92:4>
This system does not meet ICAO specifications and therefore is
considered as <quote> &ldquo; impairment of safe aircraft operations. &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#93:4>
<quote> &ldquo; Why government is adamant on maintaining NAIA in
Pasay City as the country 's premier international airport when it cannot be
sustainable, &rdquo; </quote> Hilvano said, <quote> &ldquo; is stupidity of
the highest degree. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#94:4>
JAMP insists that there are other alternative uses for NAIA that
can better benefit the people of Pasay. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#95:4>
Within the NAIA area alone, conservative estimates show that
there are about 32,000 households in 18 squatter colonies occupying NAIA
lands falling within the MIAA jurisdiction.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#96:4>
Biggest among these is the Balagbag, Merville area with 8,000
families. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#97:4>
Worse, about 3,000 of them are occupying highly dangerous zones
like creeks and canals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#98:4>
So, according to Hilvano, with NAIA being converted for
commercial and light industrial uses and providing for an on-site socialized
mass housing, the social and economic benefits not only to the people of
Pasay will be enormous. </p> </I>

A MOTORCADE in Quezon City yesterday gave strong hints that
Malaca&ntilde;ang is not exactly a disinterested observer in Novaliches '
quest to become a city. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#101:5>
The motorcade, which started in SM Fairview and wound up at
Novaliches <indig> Bayan </indig> , was spearheaded by the United Novaliches
for Program Movement ( UNFPM), a group closely identified with the <indig>
&ldquo; JEEP ni Erap &rdquo; </indig> organization. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#102:5>
The UNFPM is headed by Larry Grajeda, UNFPM president,
reportedly President Estrada 's choice as acting mayor once Novaliches wins
cityhood. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#103:5>
It is the President who will appoint the new city 's officer in
charge if the &ldquo; yes &rdquo; vote prevails in the plebiscite this
Saturday. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#104:5>
Grajeda is the public information officer of the defunct
Presidential Anti-Crime Commission ( PACC) under then Vice-President Estrada.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#105:5>
<quote> &ldquo; Let us ( Quezon City residents) support the
Novaliches cityhood.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#106:5>
This is all we need to achieve our dream, a real development,
&rdquo; </quote> Grajeda said yesterday. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#107:5>
He appealed to Quezon City Mayor Mel Mathay, Jr., Congressman
Dante Liban and other city officials to support the plebiscite and not to
taint it with politics. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#108:5>
&ldquo; I am against any political agenda, especially the
old-dirty politics, in the Novaliches cityhood.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#109:5>
This is not a fight between politicians but a battle for a
Novaliches ' future, &rdquo; </quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#110:5>
He said he would not hesitate if President Estrada appoints him
as the first acting mayor of Novaliches. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#111:5>
<quote> &ldquo; I will respect any decision of President
Estrada.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#112:5>
But it 's too early to talk who will be the mayor; the most
important thing now is the victory of Novaliches ' cityhood, &rdquo; </quote>
Grajeda said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#113:5>
Novaliches Cityhood Movement president Cesar Roque, who also
joined the motorcade, said he was not targeting any Quezon City official when
he exposed the alleged attempts to bribe <indig> barangay </indig> officials
to campaign against cityhood. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#114:5>
Roque said he just heard the information about the alleged
bribery from a <indig> barangay </indig> official and some Novaliches
residents and he was not sure whether the information was true or not. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#115:5>
He said his group does not believe in resorting to dirty
tactics, and that he believes that Mathay would never tolerate, much more
use, dirty tactics in the coming plebiscite. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#116:5>
Former Quezon City Vice Mayor Charito Planas has revealed that
she would vote &ldquo; yes &rdquo; in the plebiscite. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#117:5>
<quote> &ldquo; Let us allow Novaliches to establish its
independence for it might be a way to its swift development and progress,
&rdquo; </quote> Planas said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#118:5>
For the past 60 years, Planas admitted that Novaliches remained
the &ldquo; sleepy part &rdquo; of Quezon City despite having 15 <indig>
barangays </indig> with a population of 187,000.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-018#119:5>
She said the Quezon City government could no longer provide even the
basic necessities of Novaliches. </p>
