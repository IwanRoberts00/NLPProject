Yes well actually I have here a brochure or a catalogue of another school

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-091#148:1:B>
Of another school

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-091#149:1:A>
Yes it 's quite near our office it 's around it is also in Makati
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-091#152:1:A>
Uhm I 'm kind of thinking which school would be best suited for me

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-091#153:1:B>
Of course our school is the best <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-091#154:1:A>
Well of course <O> laughter </O> whatever you say

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-091#155:1:B>
But you know what uh what kind of uh degree program would you like to be into 



<ICE-PHI:S1A-091#> I mean would you like to be a missionary or a pastor maybe you can get uhm M Div <&> Masters in Divinity </&> in Mission or M Div in Pastoral Studies something like Biblical Studies

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-091#156:1:A>
Well uhm well I really like to work in a school <{> <[> as a counselor </[> or even as a teacher even a seminary teacher you know I enjoy I enjoy teaching 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-091#157:1:B>
<[> A school </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-091#160:1:B>
Teaching maybe you can get the same uhm degree program as I am uh as I am into

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-091#161:1:A>
Okay which is

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-091#162:1:B>
Uh that 's M A in Christian Education but you can get the the M Div in Christian Education which is uh a higher you know a higher program because you you learn uh Greek the Hebrew

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-091#163:1:A>
Oh you learn the Greek language you mean they teach Greek

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-091#164:1:B>
Yeah they teach Greek and Hebrew in M Div courses but in M A courses they don't teach
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-091#165:1:B>
We don't have to uh we don't require to get that uh subject

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-091#166:1:A>
Oh I see okay

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-091#167:1:B>
Uh yeah but uh you know M Div is much uh uh it 's much difficult but uh it 's more challenging if you are in that uh course

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-091#168:1:A>
So those courses uhm mold you into a pastor or

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-091#169:1:B>
Uh more likely yeah more likely into a uh pastor or a church church leader type yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-091#170:1:A>
Church leader <{> <[> <,> </[> sounds interesting
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-091#171:1:A>
