<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#1:1:A>
Mr President distinguished colleagues <,> in June <,> students go back to school
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#2:1:A>
Today enrolment is going on
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#3:1:A>
We are again faced with the challenge of tuition fees how much what amount of increases what other charges how many students may not enroll because they can no longer afford
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#8:1:A>
We have already mandated Mr President allowable increase in Republic Act sixty-seven twenty-eight under certain conditions because we recognize that schools must pay increased salaries must meet rising costs must upgrade needed facilities like laboratories
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#10:1:A>
The issue therefore is not just increases but whether or not the conditions for increases have been observed by the proper officials as prescribed by law
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#11:1:A>
We submit Mr President that the Secretary of Education has violated the law that he has disregarded the conditions for the increases of tuition fees
that he has relegated unto himself certain powers vested by law in other entities relegated them unto himself
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#15:1:A>
Previously Mr President before the enactment of Republic Act sixty-seven twenty-eight the Secretary of Education had the power to prescribe school tuition fees under the Education Act of nineteen eighty-two as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the case of Philippine Consumers Foundation versus the Secretary of Education one hundred and fifty three SCRA sixty-two
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#16:1:A>
In that case Mr President the Philippine Consumers Foundation sought to prohibit the Secretary of DECS from fixing tuition increases because the power to regulate according to them did not include the power to authorize increases
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#17:1:A>
And secondly they said because the parents and students concerned <,> whose tuition fees were increases were increased were never given notice never given an opportunity to be heard
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#18:1:A>
And therefore they said they were denied the constitutional right of due process
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#19:1:A>
Supreme Court Mr President in that case held that the power to regulate school fees at that time included the power to authorize increases citing specific provisions of the Education Act
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#20:1:A>
It 's also said that there existed no denial of due process because the authorization was for general application as when the authorization was for increases to apply to all private schools throughout the country
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#21:1:A>
But Mr President that was yesterday
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#22:1:A>
Today we have Republic Act sixty-seven twenty-eight and section ten of said law categorically states that in any proposed increases any in the private schools there must be appropriate consultations conducted by the school administration with the duly organized parent and <w> teachers' </w> associations and faculty associations with respect to secondary schools
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#23:1:A>
And for colleges with student governments with student councils alumni and factory faculty associations and in all cases audited financial statements are required
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#24:1:A>
The law Mr President classifies schools into two categories
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#25:1:A>
First those charging less than one thousand five hundred pesos a year for high schools and eighty pesos per unit for colleges during the school years nineteen eighty-eight to nineteen ninety uh to nineteen eighty-nine
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#26:1:A>
The second category Mr President refers to schools and colleges charging said amounts or more
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#27:1:A>
The first group of schools are still regulated
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#28:1:A>
But they are <.> ye </.> regulated no longer by the DECS no longer by the Secretary of the Department of Education insofar as tuition fees are concerned but by the State Assistance Council as provided by law
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#30:1:A>
The second group comprises schools and colleges that are deregulated
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#31:1:A>
They charge tuition fees higher than one thousand five hundred pesos for high school and eighty pesos or more per unit for college
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#32:1:A>
Any increase in tuition fees should be made by the schools but always in consultation with the designated parties not by the DECS or with the DECS
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#33:1:A>
There appears Mr President several violations 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#> The first is that the State Assistance Council does not have a student representative does not have a teacher representative as required by law
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#34:1:A>
The State Assistance Council as organized today was established precisely to render assistance to students and teachers in that regulated category
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#35:1:A>
Because the law Mr President that we forged here seeks to help deserving students
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#36:1:A>
And the law therefore created the State Assistance Council composed of the DECS Secretary the Department of Budget and Management representatives the Department of Science and Technology the students designate a teacher representative and a representative of the school
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#37:1:A>
This collegial body Mr President gives free tuition and subsidies to deserving students like valedictorians and salutatorians
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#38:1:A>
And therefore they <.> e </.> they are the ones who determine how many will be given subsidies how many will be free from any tuition and therefore determine how much would be the tuition fee increases if any
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#40:1:A>
They must also decide <,> as already pointed out Mr President the rules and regulations pertaining to increase tuition fees and other fees
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#41:1:A>
This refers to schools charging less than one thousand five hundred pesos a year for high schools and for college not more than eighty pesos per unit in other words the still regulated category of schools
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#43:1:A>
But whether the increases are regulated by the State Assistance Council or not Mr President the fact remains that consultations are required audited financial statements are needed
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#45:1:A>
The division of the increase seventy percent to go to salaries and wages for teachers and non-teaching personnel must be observed
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#46:1:A>
Twenty percent for upgrading of facilities must be implemented
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#47:1:A>
And in the light of the law there appears several violations Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#48:1:A>
One there are no teachers no student representatives in the State Assistance Council
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#49:1:A>
How can they function adequately if there exists no voice from the students and the teachers no vote from these affected parties
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#51:1:A>
Second violation Mr President Secretary Cari&ntilde;o issued DECS Order number thirty dated March eleven nineteen ninety-one prescribing tuition fees when he no longer has the power to do so
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#52:1:A>
This power is now lodged for schools in the first category with the State Assistance Council and the schools themselves
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#53:1:A>
And the second category with the schools Mr President provided that consultations and the other conditions like audited financial statements are complied with
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#54:1:A>
Third violation as a result there exists faulty implementation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#55:1:A>
Sometimes there are consultation many times there are none many times the schools merely inform
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#58:1:A>
As of May twenty-second nineteen ninety-one Mr President Santa Scholastica College raised their tuition fees by twenty-five percent with consultations
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#59:1:A>
On the other hand the National College of Business and Arts increased tuition fees by ten percent no consultations
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#60:1:A>
Ateneo raised by twenty-five percent with consultations
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#61:1:A>
Rizal Tech Colleges in Mandaluyong raised by five to ten percent no consultations
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#62:1:A>
Central College of the Philippines increased by thirty percent no consultations
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#63:1:A>
All of these Mr President are accredited institutions all are subject to the same law
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#65:1:A>
But preliminary survey shows that there exists violations rather than adherence
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#66:1:A>
Last year alone fourteen schools supposedly violated the law
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#67:1:A>
In nineteen eighty-nine the DECS National Capital Region alone Mr President reported seventy-five cases of tuition increases increased violation in spite of the existence of the mandate
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#68:1:A>
The question is why
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#69:1:A>
What good is the law
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#70:1:A>
What good are the penalties provided for if the proper authorities cannot enforce the law <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#71:1:A>
Number four violation Mr President the DECS Secretary in his DECS Order number thirty fixed tuitions fees for upper students and said these schools are exempted from consultation provided the increases were within the limits that he prescribed
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#72:1:A>
He has no business Mr President to fix rates no business to say no consultations no business to disregard financial audits
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#75:1:A>
Mr President let us help
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#76:1:A>
There is unrest already amongst the students
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#77:1:A>
There are anxieties amongst parents
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#78:1:A>
There is deep concern by the teachers
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#79:1:A>
And it seems that growing confusion is compounded by lack of adequate implementation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#80:1:A>
Let the Committee on Education headed by Senator Angara look into this
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#81:1:A>
Let the students come let the teachers come let the State Assistance Council members come and tell us so that we will really know the problems and perhaps adopt proper solutions so that we rectify the wrong and help those aggrieved
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#82:1:A>
We owe it to the nation Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#83:1:A>
We owe it to ourselves
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#84:1:A>
We owe it to the students and the teachers and the parties concerned
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#85:1:A>
Thank you

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#86:1:B>
Senator Lina and then Senator Angara <,,> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#87:1:C>
Thank you Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#88:1:C>
Will the Majority Floor Leader yield for some questions

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#89:1:A>
Certainly Mr President <,> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#90:1:C>
Firstly Mr President I 'd like to congratulate uh the indefatigable uh Majority Floor Leader for taking up uh the cudgels for our uh youth who are still of uh school age
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#91:1:C>
Uh we in the Committee on Youth and Sports Development uh join him in uh in this uh privilege uh speech entitled <mention> The Challenge to Tuition Fees </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#92:1:C>
We are one with you Mr uh President in your uh <,> criticisms against the way Republic Act six seven two eight has been and is being implemented by the Department of Education Culture and Sports especially on the aspect of uh consultation as specified in section ten of the Republic Act uh mentioned
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#93:1:C>
Uh this representation and together with the Senate President were the one who authored section ten of Republic Act six seven two eight on the need for consultation in all tuition increases
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#94:1:C>
However Mr President uh the justification being used by the DECS in issuing for example DECS Order number thirty and other previous orders is the is a certain opinion issued by the Department of Justice that uh if the increase in uh tuition is within the level of uh say one <.> hun </.> one thousand below one thousand five hundred pesos a year uh for high schools
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#95:1:C>
So schools charging less than one thousand five hundred pesos a year for high schools and eighty thousand <&> error = should be just eighty </&> pesos per unit for colleges during school year nineteen eighty-eight eighty-nine they are no longered covered they are no longer covered by uh the provision on consultation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#96:1:C>
It 's only those schools that are charging above this level are the ones being uh uh mandated by the DECS to uh undertake this uh procedure on consultation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#97:1:C>
Now uh therefore there is a stalemate uh at this point Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#98:1:C>
DECS is using the D O J opinion as the justification the D O J being the legal arm of the uh legal arm of the uh Executive uh branch uh has uh issued its uh opinion
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#99:1:C>
And then the DECS relies on that opinion
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#100:1:C>
But I 'd like to know from uh our Majority Floor Leader what is his uh uh proposal
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#101:1:C>
How will the students can uh effectively challenge the DECS Order number thirty considering that the DECS is relying on a D O J opinion
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#102:1:C>
Will the students have to go to the Supreme Court and resolve the issue there or should the students and the parents go to the to Congress and ask for a clarification through another piece of uh legislation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#104:1:C>
May we know the insights of the Majority Floor Leader on this uh issue Mr President

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#105:1:A>
Thank you Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#106:1:A>
I think that the law is very clear
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#107:1:A>
It has made no distinction
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#108:1:A>
It refers to all increases not to the increases of those <.> catego </.> uh schools under category one where the tuition is one thousand five hundred pesos and eighty pesos per unit respectively
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#109:1:A>
But to all and where the law does not distinguish I don't think even the Secretary of Justice can distinguish
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#110:1:A>
Secondly Mr President it is the lower levels because <?> they </?> are the poorest students who really deserve more consultations
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#111:1:A>
It is there where uh the audited financial statements are required
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#112:1:A>
It is there where the seventy percent twenty percent allocation is needed because many of these schools and I do not want to disparage them but that is the reality in the provinces especially have rickety structures and very poor laboratories <foreign> etcetera </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#113:1:A>
And yet these are the ones who are supposed to be regulated but no consultations
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#114:1:A>
<.> Wa </.> what kind of uh uh protection do we give them if we remove the process of consultation Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#115:1:A>
And so therefore I submit that the best way is for uh us to clarify the intent of the Senate through perhaps a resolution after the investigation shall have been made

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#116:1:C>
Well Your Honor the matter is uh the matter is pending before the uh our Committee on uh Education headed by Senator Angara
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#117:1:C>
And time and again we have referred to this to this law particularly section ten on consultation because <,> uh to my mind it is the unanimous position already of the Senate
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#118:1:C>
From the Senate President uh down to this uh representation we have already uh come out with uh a position on this matter
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#119:1:C>
I 've read the statement coming from the Senate President that in all tuition increases <.> the </.> there should be a consultation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#120:1:C>
And in fact uh as I said earlier this was so clarified during the uh proceeding here proceedings conducted on this on this bill when we were deliberating on this
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#121:1:C>
And we came up with a section ten uh precisely uh and also because all the sectors will be affected by the tuition increase will have to be consulted
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#122:1:C>
The teachers for example who are supposed to benefit because seventy percent of the tuition increase should go to the salaries and wages of the of the teachers and a certain percentage will go to improvement of facilities
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#123:1:C>
And uh whether the increase is favorable or not <.> fav </.> favorable to the teachers the teachers should be consulted and the students should be consulted
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#124:1:C>
So it was very clear to our mind Mr President that uh there should be consultation in all in all increases
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#125:1:C>
And I think that 's also the view already expressed by the Chairman of the Committee on Education

 <$?> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#126:1:?> Yes

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#127:1:C>
But the problem precisely is uh uh even if we pass a resolution here uh despite the preponderance of statements coming from this upper uh chamber uh on this issue of consultation the DECS continue to be uh belligerent
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#128:1:C>
Uh I <.> wi </.> I withdraw the word but uh it <.> ha </.> it has stood pat on its uh position uh that the D O J uh position is that uh uh only those that are above the one thousand five hundred peso uh tuition in high school and those uh uh more than eighty pesos per unit in the tertiary level they are the only ones that uh require consultation the the schools charging those uh fees

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#130:1:A>
<{> <[> Yes </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#131:1:B>
<[> I mean </[> </{> so <indig> 'yon po ang uh 'yun po ang sitwasyon eh uh ang </indig> implementation <indig> ang </indig> DECS
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#132:1:B>
It relies on the D O J opinion despite the already statements coming from us here
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#133:1:B>
So that is the situation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#134:1:B>
Do you think a resolution uh passed by by this chamber will uh will be sufficient Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#135:1:B>
Supposing the the DECS again says no we are relying on the D O J opinion uh if this <.> the </.> has to be tested let this let it be tested to the to the court by the by the uh or you know let the parties go to the courts for final uh arbitration of the issue 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#136:1:B>
<indig> 'Yun ayun ho yata ang gustong mangyari ng </indig> DECS

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#137:1:A>
Well the DECS itself Mr President through Secretary Cari&ntilde;o issued uh DECS Order number thirty of nineteen ninety-one series and in that Executive Order they fixed tuition fee increases for tertiary level for upper students

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#138:1:C>
Also in high school Mr President

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#139:1:A>
Yes and then they uh said no consultations for those who follow this prescription
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#140:1:A>
That is not the law
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#141:1:A>
That is contrary to the law and not touched upon by the Secretary of Justice

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#143:1:C>
Yes I agree with you on on that point uh Mr President that that the DECS uh the Secretary uh overstepped uh his uh prerogative uh under under the law because uh he exempted again he fixed the rate uh and established a certain ceiling

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-055#145:1:A>
Ceiling 

 </I>
