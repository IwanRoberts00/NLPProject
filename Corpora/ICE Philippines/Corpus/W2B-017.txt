<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#3:1>
QUIETLY but surely, unknown in the big cities, about a third of
the rural banks across the entire country are experiencing liquidity problems
as a result of the <mention> Asian flu </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#4:1>
Depressed markets and the ensuing deflation are sending the small and
medium enterprises ( SMEs) and the agrarian economy itself tumbling down.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#5:1>
Specifically, there are dramatic increases in nonperforming
assets, the other type of <mention> &ldquo; NPA &rdquo; </mention> which is
wreaking havoc in the countryside presently.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#6:1>
Past-due loans or bad debts are rearing their ugly heads on the credit
landscape, the same problems being experienced by the Japanese mega-banks.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#7:1>
The Philippine rural banks are a microcosm of the Japanese mega-banks.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#8:1>
<h> <bold> Seven deadly virtues </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#9:1>
How do we make rural banks bankable during these times of
recession?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#10:1>
Larry Esguerra, professor of Banking and Finance and Director of
Credit Programs at the Ateneo Graduate School of Business, which has
established a partnership training institute with the Bankers Association of
the Philippines ( BAP), gives us some tips.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#11:1>
Larry used to be a CEO of Golden Bay Federal Credit Union in Moffett
Field, California. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#12:1>
Larry gives seven key pointers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#13:1>
First, to be able to achieve and enhance rural bank performances,
existing NPAs should be written off.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#14:1>
Let the bank start with a clean slate.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#15:1>
The books are clean and the bank has a better financial status
because the burden from these NPAs on bank performance is removed.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#16:1>
Prudent accounting procedures dictate the exact way to treat NPAs.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#17:1>
These NPAs will eventually be written off anyway by the <indig>
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#18:1>
There is no choice.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#19:1>
Do it now than later under duress.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#20:1>
The ultimate measure of any bank is the <mention> Return on Assets (
ROA) </mention> which is simply the ratio of net income over total assets.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#21:1>
A bank with a big assets base but little income has a low ROA.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#22:1>
ROA is thus increased when NPAs are written off. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#23:1>
Second, the writing off of NPAs does not mean that these are
abandoned.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#24:1>
There should still be renewed effort to collect.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#25:1>
This arduous task is better left to specialists, namely collection
agencies who have the capability to pursue legal means to collect. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#26:1>
This does not mean banks should be merciless during these times
of want.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#27:1>
The premise is borrowers will pay if they can.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#28:1>
They are not renegades who will run away.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#29:1>
They will not pay if they simply have no more money.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#30:1>
Collection must be coupled with consideration of the recession.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#31:1>
Give them time and maximum tolerance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#32:1>
Third is the tenet of banking capability.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#33:1>
Most rural banks today have no capability to properly evaluate
prospective borrowers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#34:1>
They cannot see good from bad credit.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#35:1>
There is a need to overhaul credit evaluation systems of rural banks
through proper training of management.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#36:1>
Properly evaluated credits are half-collected already. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#37:1>
Well-managed banks go for quality not quantity in increasing loan
portfolios.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#38:1>
As an example, clients with collateral do not mean they will pay or
that the loans are &ldquo; safe".

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#39:1>
With or without collateral, clients with good cash flows insure their
capability to pay.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#40:1>
And good collateral coupled with bad cash management is disastrous.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#41:1>
So, credit evaluators have to look at other &ldquo; financial
windows", not just collaterals, in evaluating the bankability of borrowers.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#42:1>
Fourth, nothing can replace an effective loans monitoring system
as the way to reduce future NPAs.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#43:1>
For example, a bank should act immediately when signs of nonpayment
are seen.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#44:1>
If a loan is past-due for a month, a systematic procedure must be in
place and implemented right away.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#45:1>
Effort must be vigorous and consistent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#46:1>
The absence of collection effort gives a &ldquo; hint &rdquo; to the
borrower that the bank is not interested in running after the account.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#47:1>
It actually encourages payment default. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#48:1>
One cannot wait another month without action, otherwise, one is
inducing the very nonpayment one is trying to avoid.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#49:1>
Chances of payment on the third month are slim based on experience.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#50:1>
The procedure to run after an account should include a one-to-one
treatment of past-loans. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#51:1>
The system should also include the accurate and on-time
preparation of past-due-accounts reports on a monthly basis which should be
reviewed by the board.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#52:1>
These reports are critical management information for proper
disposition.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#53:1>
Critical accounts must be identified right away.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#54:1>
A special monitoring system for these critical accounts will enhance
collections. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#55:1>
Fifth is the tenet of &ldquo; owners as managers".

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#56:1>
The role of the rural bank 's board is critical because it involves
guidelines and policies.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#57:1>
If the board is insulated from operational problems of the bank, it
will be incapable of pursuing policies which will solve critical problems
such as ever increasing NPAs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#58:1>
The board must be involved in monitoring and overseeing all
aspects of bank operations through regular meetings.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#59:1>
Absentee board members is one way to insure unattended NPAs.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#60:1>
If members are &ldquo; too busy", then they deserve what is coming to
them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#61:1>
Sixth is the tenet of integrated management training program.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#62:1>
As articulated above, rural bank managers must undergo proper
training in credit and collection and financial analysis and planning.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#63:1>
There must be a full blown integrated management training program in
the medium term as a response to an era of recession and economic decline
which naturally threatens smaller banks. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#64:1>
Seventh and last, the training of government must be complemented
by the hiring of key consultants who are experts in credit evaluation, loans
monitoring, financial analysis and strategizing, etc.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#65:1>
They include the fast track hands-on training of managers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#66:1>
The training of management can come from these consultants not only
through seminars but also on actual hands-on in the implementation of the
consultants ' recommendations and of evolved strategies. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#67:1>
<h> <bold> National economy and the rural banks </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#68:1>
Many rural banks need to be rescued but there is no government or
private sector entity to address this because this is a new problem.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#69:1>
Liquidity problems of rural banks on a massive scale is being
experienced for the first time.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#70:1>
The <indig> Bangko Sentral </indig> can institute policy reforms to
address this.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#71:1>
Land Bank and DBP may have crucial roles. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#72:1>
Private sector interventions are also possible through existing
rural bank associations where CEOs and board members know each other.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#73:1>
Mergers can be facilitated through these associations.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#74:1>
They can also address common solutions to common problems and share
human resources.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#75:1>
Alliances with bigger commercial banks are also possible if we can
somehow bridge the gap between the big cities and the countryside. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#76:1>
If rural banks fail, we will see the rise of a more vicious and
expanded loan shark system. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#77:1>
Indeed, even the loan sharks are experiencing collection
problems.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#78:1>
But the loan sharks as a banking system, illicit as they are, are
much larger by far than all the rural banks combined. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#79:1>
This strange phenomenon is a product of a protracted credit
crisis in the countryside and the medieval <foreign> encomienda </foreign>
system persisting in the tenancy and sharing schemes of our present agrarian
economy.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#80:1>
And as a result, our agrarian economy has been consistently
marginalized.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#81:1>
Usury, or the <mention> 4-5-6 system </mention> , persists in all
crops--rice, corn, coconut, vegetables, fish. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#82:1>
You name it, there is someone on the side lending at usurious
rates because the rural banking system is weak and fears lending to peasants.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#83:1>
And to think that our economy is about 70 percent agrarian and 70
percent of our population survive from it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#84:1>
The situation is not hopeless for rural banks.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#85:1>
There is ample room for financial maneuverability.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#86:1>
The initiatives must come from both victims and rescuers, whether
government or private sector, to come put with creative solutions as a
response to recession. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#87:1>
Rural banks have a key socio-economic role of service to both the
SMEs and the entire agrarian sector.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#88:1>
Their success translates into better food security for the entire
nation, less imported basic commodities, less usury for the poor and less
instability and tendency towards insurgency.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#89:1>
Indeed, their role is just as crucial as commercial banks in the big
cities.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#90:1>
This is why it is critical for our rural banks to make it through
this present crisis. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> What do depreciation rates tell us? </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#92:2>
<bold> Johnny Noe Raval </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#93:2>
A FEW days ago, we were casually discussing wedding arrangements
and the impending career shift of one of our friends when the topic abruptly
changed.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#94:2>
After some jostling, someone finally asked me how depreciation rates
should be calculated.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#95:2>
The question seemed strange, specially coming from someone who deals
with these numbers almost daily.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#96:2>
My first thought was this must be a trick question but I just could
not think of anything funny about foreign exchange rates for the past year.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#97:2>
Since the question did come with a half-startled look, I figured that
a point was to be expected in the next minute or so. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#98:2>
True enough, there was good reason to be startled.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#99:2>
With the peso revaluing against the dollar from &peso;26.40-&dollar;1
in early July 1997 to the current level of roughly &peso;42.00-&dollar;1,
just exactly how much has the depreciation rate been thus far?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#100:2>
The immediate reaction of everyone around the table was to subtract
&peso;26.40 from &peso;42.00 and divide by &peso;26.40.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#101:2>
This would turn out to be slightly above 59 percent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#102:2>
If we apply this simple method to the currencies in the region,
we would find from table 1 that the Indonesian <foreign> rupiah </foreign>
has depreciated the most followed by the Thai <foreign> baht </foreign> and
the Malaysian <foreign> ringgit </foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#103:2>
Based on this calculation, most analysts relate the magnitude of
the depreciation to the comparative weakness of the respective economies.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#104:2>
This is also partly why almost everyone comments that the
Philippines--a small and fragile economy--has weathered the currency crisis
comparatively well. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#105:2>
Now here 's the point.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#106:2>
In the April 18, 1998 issue of <mention> The Economist </mention> ,
the point was raised that it is not possible to lose more than 100 percent of
the value of the currency.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#107:2>
Any tradeable asset or commodity has a price and it is this price
which reflects its market value.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#108:2>
To suggest that such an asset can lose more than 100 percent of its
value is to imply that there are commodities with negative prices.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#109:2>
This is not the same as the distinction made by economists between a
&ldquo; good &rdquo; and a &ldquo; bad &rdquo; since we are strictly limiting
things to &ldquo; goods". </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#110:2>
The fact is that there is no &ldquo; good &rdquo; in the market
with a negative price.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#111:2>
We are also not talking about the possible complications with
&ldquo; short selling".

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#112:2>
While I agree that short selling can be a disastrous activity if you
incorrectly anticipate, what <mention> The Economist </mention> is saying is
that the price itself of the commodity cannot turn negative even though
losses may be incurred in the course of using the commodity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#113:2>
Since the point is a truism of sorts, then it can only mean that
our conventional calculation of the depreciation rate is incorrect.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#114:2>
If the <foreign> rupiah </foreign> has not fallen by 495 percent and
the <foreign> baht </foreign> has not weakened by 66 percent, then the peso
has also not depreciated by 59 percent against the US dollar.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#115:2>
If these figures are all incorrect anyway, is it possible that the
Philippines may actually have fared worse than what we have been thinking all
along?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#116:2>
And if calculating depreciation rates can be confusing, is there
informational value in hearing these figures publicly? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#117:2>
The first order of business is to find out just exactly how much
the regional currencies have depreciated against the US dollar.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#118:2>
From the exchange rates listed in table 2, the correct depreciation
rates come out as 83 percent for the <foreign> rupiah </foreign> , 35 percent
for the <foreign> won </foreign> , 39 percent for the <foreign> ringgit
</foreign> , 40 percent for the <foreign> baht </foreign> and 37 percent for
the peso.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#119:2>
Am I certain of these calculations?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#120:2>
The answer is simply &ldquo; YES". </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#121:2>
The source of the confusion in the calculation of depreciation
rates is practical as it is philosophical.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#122:2>
The practical side of this arises in the way exchange rates are
quoted.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#123:2>
Since an exchange rate is bilateral between a local economy and its
foreign partner a necessary distinction is made between the <it> commodity
currency </it> and the <it> terms currency </it> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#124:2>
The former is the currency to be priced while the latter is the
currency which will serve as the price scale in the valuation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#125:2>
When we say that the peso-dollar rate is &peso;42.00-&dollar;1 in
this form the dollar is the commodity currency and it is the peso which is
the terms currency. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#126:2>
The problem is that from a Philippine standpoint, the peso 's
value in dollar terms is really &dollar;0.02381-&peso;1, not the
&dollar;1-&peso;42.00 rate we often hear.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#127:2>
Both ratios are actually numerically equivalent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#128:2>
But it is rather &ldquo; awkward &rdquo; to say that the peso 's
value is &peso;42.00-&dollar;1 because in this sense it is the dollar which
is being priced in peso terms.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-017#129:2>
Unfortunately, while it is &ldquo; more proper &rdquo; to quote the
peso 's worth as &dollar;0.02381-&peso;1, it is not in common use perhaps
because most of us find the decimals much too &ldquo; cumbersome &rdquo; to
handle. </p> </I>
