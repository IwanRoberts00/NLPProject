<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#2:1:B>
Okay uhm <,> educational background
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#3:1:B>
I just finished law school in the States and I passed the Minnesota bar and I trained in the U S

<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#9:1:B>
And I 'm hoping to take the bar again next year for the Philippine Bar after petitioning the Supreme Court 'cause they might not let me take it after a few years there

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#10:1:A>
Uh uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#11:1:B>

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#12:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#13:1:B>
In the family I 'm the ninth <{> <[> <,> </[> <unclear> words </unclear> I was the baby before my nephew came <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#14:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 



<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#> And you are so <,> you 've been away for how many years

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#15:1:B>
Three years

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#16:1:A>
Three years <,> out in Illinois <indig> 'no </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#17:1:B>
Yeah two years in Illinois then I spent my last year in Minnesota

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#18:1:A>
Uh so <,> I 'm here to ask you about your Dad
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#19:1:A>
I 'm doing it for my thesis
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#20:1:A>
So you 're not working yet <indig> 'no </indig> you just finished

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#22:1:B>
Uhm I 'm <,> I 'm a researcher at Free Legal Assistance Group the FLAG office

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#23:1:A>
Uh huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#24:1:B>
Uhm since I can't take the bar until next year what <unclear> word </unclear> until I can so I 'm doing legal research for FLAG

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#25:1:A>
Uh so now you 're you 're a lawyer and your Dad was a lawyer
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#26:1:A>
Did he influence you in any way

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#27:1:B>
Yes <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#28:1:A>
<unclear> words </unclear> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#29:1:B>
I think I 've I 've I 'm not sure I wouldn't have been a lawyer if it weren't for Dad
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#30:1:B>
I always started out saying no I 'm going to be an artist
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#31:1:B>
No I 'll be an archaeologist
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#32:1:B>
I don't want to become a lawyer
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#33:1:B>
I always said no I don't wanna be a lawyer
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#35:1:B>
And <,> uh it seemed that everywhere I turned it would always end up with me going back in the direction of law school

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#36:1:A>
Oh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#37:1:B>
And he was a big influence
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#38:1:B>
It was something I knew would make him really happy if I did go to law school

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#39:1:A>
Did he ask you did he ask you no
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#40:1:A>
<{> <[> But you </[> could sense it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#41:1:B>
<[> No </[> </{> yeah
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#42:1:B>
Yeah 'cause when I told him that one time that I had decided to okay for sure I 'm going to law school
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#43:1:B>
He was really really uh <quote> that 's good </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#44:1:B>
<{> <[> That </[> kind of tone of voice

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#45:1:A>
<[> Uh </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#46:1:B>
And I knew he was really really happy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#47:1:B>
So that that was the big influence part <unclear> words </unclear> it was nice to make him feel <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#48:1:B>
I felt he he really wanted me to go
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#49:1:B>
'Cause I 'm the only girl who 's gone through law <{> <[> school </[> although Cookie probably knows more about the law than I do <{> <[> 'cause she worked again with him </[> practically
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#54:1:B>
But uh I 'm the only one who really went through formal training 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#50:1:A>
<[> Uh </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#52:1:A>
<[> Uh-huh yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#55:1:A>
Uh so how old were you before you he formally went <,> into politics that was around nineteen

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#56:1:B>
No <,> I was born in nineteen sixty-four I think around four years when he was already starting

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#57:1:A>
So you have no memory of him aside outside you know his political life
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#58:1:A>
Before that I mean before he was really into the limelight
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#59:1:A>
So <,> what do you remember most about him you know his being a family man
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#61:1:A>
<{> <[> Uh </[> what do you

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#62:1:B>
<[> Uh </[> </{> he was always around to talk to
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#63:1:B>
He liked to read

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#64:1:A>
Uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#65:1:B>
Uhm we liked to read the same books <{> <[> so we read the same books </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#66:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#67:1:B>
We 'd always go to bookstores

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#68:1:A>
<{> <[> He was fond of reading </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#69:1:B>
<[> I think </[> </{> that was I think our main activity he 'd come up
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#70:1:B>
He was tired of work and I would be home from school he 'd say C 'mon <,> let 's go to the bookstore 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#71:1:B>
So we 'd all go together and you uh
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#72:1:B>
And then we 'd be reading the same books
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#73:1:B>
So it would be fun
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#74:1:B>
It could be a family outing
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#75:1:B>
And when I was a kid he liked to take a lot of photographs

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#76:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#77:1:B>
That was one of his major hobbies
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#78:1:B>
So <,> I have lots of since I was the baby at that time I was one of the favorite subjects <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#79:1:B>
So if you look at the family albums there 're <{> <[> lots of pictures </[> of me

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#80:1:A>
<[> Lots of pictures </[> </{> of you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#81:1:A>
Interesting
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#82:1:A>
So he liked photography <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#83:1:A>
What about his uhm <,> his his what do you call this his writings
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#84:1:A>
I know that he <,> he also liked to write especially during his detention
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#85:1:A>
<{> <[> He liked </[> to write a lot

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#86:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#87:1:B>
For each us like there was a time when he was in solitary confinement and there wasn't anything he could do
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#88:1:B>
He would pray the rosary and he would make a poem
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#89:1:B>
And that was all
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#90:1:B>
I mean he couldn't they weren't allowing him any access to books or the radio or what
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#91:1:B>
So he would just think and he would make a poem
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#92:1:B>
And then when we finally got to see him about a month after he 'd told us all the poems he 'd memorized them completely
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#94:1:B>
And he had one for each of us
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#95:1:B>
And we 've kept all his letters from prison every birthday 'cause he couldn't really buy anything or make any uh buy anything for us
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#96:1:B>
He would either like I have a kit he had this <,> model of a Cinderella coach

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#97:1:A>
<{> <[> Uh </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#98:1:B>
<[> It </[> </{> it 's more a pump with uh with water
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#99:1:B>
And at the background there 's the Cinderella coach
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#100:1:B>
And those would be his gifts
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#101:1:B>
He 'd make crafts

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#102:1:A>
Ahh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#103:1:B>
And then always the letters
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#104:1:B>
And if he couldn't make anything it 'd be one of the roses he grew in his tiny garden and always a letter

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#105:1:A>
How does it affect you personally <,> 'cause you were very close to him <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#106:1:A>
I think you 're

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#107:1:B>
Yeah I was <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#108:1:B>
Yeah I was the baby for awhile until my nephew came <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#109:1:B>
By that time I was happy not to be the baby because I was in high school already

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#110:1:A>
Uh huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#111:1:B>
But okay good somebody else now
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#112:1:B>
Uhm <,> you know the way I thought was really influenced by what he did
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#113:1:B>
I only realized it when I got to high school
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#114:1:B>
'Cause I would talk about things with my classmates that they never saw
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#115:1:B>
And we all <,> when I went to Assumption and it 's true the convent walls are really high

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#116:1:A>
Uh uhm <O> laughter </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#117:1:B>
You <,> there 's nothing you don't see anything of the outside when you get out of San Lorenzo Village
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#119:1:B>
So you end up thinking yeah this is probably the world
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#121:1:B>
So when I would talk with my friends about what was going on they would say uh yeah uh yeah <,> that 's interesting
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#123:1:B>
But they never really saw

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#124:1:A>
So he really he really influenced you in thinking <indig> 'no </indig> <{> <[> <,> </[> about the world and everything 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#125:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#127:1:B>
Yeah about what was going on
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#128:1:B>
That there was something more than just within the four walls of the house or within the thick walls of the school
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#129:1:B>
There were other people
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#130:1:B>
And <,> and that 's why I <.> al </.> I became a lawyer
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#131:1:B>
I think it was there is always the desire to serve
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#132:1:B>
And I saw how much work he did
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#133:1:B>
And it 's nice to be able to you know help continue what he did

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#135:1:A>
What about you know when he went into detention
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#136:1:A>
After that <,> how would was he changed in any way I mean emotionally aside from physically <indig> ha </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#137:1:B>
It it was a big change
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#138:1:B>
'Cause when he went in nineteen seventy-two I was eight years old and Mom was very worried about the situation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#139:1:B>
So she pulled us all out of school <,> except for the ones in college
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#140:1:B>
We all studied at home for two or three years

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#141:1:A>
Three years

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#142:1:B>
Yeah <,> two years
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#143:1:B>
Then I only went back to school in grade four
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#144:1:B>
So <,> I think I took part of grade two and part of grade three it was Maya who was teaching me 'cause at that time she was getting her education degree <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> so she would tutor me
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#148:1:B>
And uhm so it was a big change in our quality of friends
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#149:1:B>
And there was that thing you know your father is under detention
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#150:1:B>
So it really didn't affect my friends
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#151:1:B>
I don't think their parents ever told them <,> don't play with her or what
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#152:1:B>
There was no change in that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#153:1:B>
But I just felt that knowing you were you had a different family life <,> kind of it sets you apart <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and the nuns would kind of look out for us 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#146:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#154:1:A>
<[2> Uh uhm </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#156:1:A>
Uh yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#157:1:B>
Yeah I always felt that you know we were always watched wherever <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#158:1:A>
Uh huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#159:1:B>
They made sure we were doing okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#160:1:B>
Uhm and 'cause we would also have I think we started having Masses in the house and <unclear> words </unclear> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#161:1:A>
But what about his attitude you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#163:1:A>
Was he <,> did he feel that he was weaker you know his spirit I mean
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#164:1:A>
It made him go
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#165:1:A>
Did it change him in any way
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#166:1:A>
He wanted to to serve for

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#167:1:B>
Yeah <,> I think it it really strengthened his resolve to do something
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#168:1:B>
But before that he was really more of a politician <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#169:1:B>
I think I mean this is thinking back
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#170:1:B>
'Cause when I was growing up I really didn't think about it that much

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#171:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#172:1:B>
Uhm before I think he was a traditional politician
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#173:1:B>
You know he went to the Senate although he would talk to people and help them as much as he could
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#175:1:B>
When he got out of prison it was a deeper commitment to really really serve
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#176:1:B>
Because he went through a lot
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#177:1:B>
He wasn't a politician anymore and he didn't have to go to the Senate or what
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#179:1:B>
He really went into lawyering
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#180:1:B>
Seriously he would travel all over
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#181:1:B>
And <,> for him it was I think <,> this is what he always said
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#182:1:B>
That he was treated very well <,> while he was under detention
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#183:1:B>
And he knew that <,> other people weren't

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#184:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#185:1:B>
And but for him he I think he really hated the experience of being confined

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#186:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#187:1:B>
And he said if it was that bad for me I was treated pretty well I had my own room they 'd never tortured me
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#191:1:B>
What about the people who were tortured they couldn't afford legal help 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#193:1:B>
And that 's what really pushed him to start the Free Legal Assistance Group FLAG and really get into it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#194:1:A>
But ahmm <,,> what about his family life
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#195:1:A>
He was very busy <indig> 'no </indig> after <{> <[> <,> </[> after this <,> he always had time for everybody

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#196:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#198:1:B>
Not as much
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#199:1:B>
Uhm uh we used to laugh I used to say that I saw more of him when he was in prison than after <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#200:1:B>
But all of us <,> I don't know we took it in stride because we all understood I think
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#203:1:B>
He he <.> al </.> he made us understand <,> which is what <,> I appreciate it that you know he explained what he was doing

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#204:1:A>
Uh-huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#205:1:B>
So we never really resented the fact that he wasn't around
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#206:1:B>
And when he was around it would always be fun
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#207:1:B>
Uhm meal times were great you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#208:1:B>
You would all sit down

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#209:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#210:1:B>
And we would talk politics
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#211:1:B>
We would talk about what was going on you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#212:1:B>
It was a <,> more than just the <mention> how was your day </mention> like that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#213:1:B>
Did you hear about this 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#214:1:B>
What did you think of that 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#215:1:A>
That was your special time right during meal time
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#216:1:A>
Probably you were all together

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#217:1:B>
Yeah we all liked to eat too <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#218:1:A>
And okay so what about family gatherings you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#219:1:A>
Did you have any reunions or anything

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#220:1:B>
Always birthdays Dad 's birthday <{> <[> Mom 's birthday </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#221:1:A>
<[> And the whole </[> </{> family would be there

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#222:1:B>
Yeah
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#223:1:B>
And Christmas
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#224:1:B>
'Cause by that time some were married or some had lived separate <unclear> words </unclear> for a time they 'd live with us
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#225:1:B>
Mench lived in Bacolod for a while and she had a separate house
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#226:1:B>
But always for birthdays we 'd be together

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#227:1:A>
So what what happened there and what would you do you know

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#228:1:B>
Uh oh I don't think we ever really had any gathering that was just really family
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#229:1:B>
He had a really public life
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#230:1:B>
He liked people and people really liked him so every time it would be his birthday friends would always drop by
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#232:1:B>
And it was always like the extended family
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#233:1:B>
I mean the only times would really be <,> I don't think we had any really family gatherings just the family <{1> <[1> except </[1> when he was in prison
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#236:1:B>
Always after that it would be a gathering of lots of friends and he 'd just circulate and go on
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#237:1:B>
Everybody would just be talking
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#238:1:B>
Uhm the kids by that time we had escaped <O> chuckle </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#239:1:B>
They used to make all the girls sing all the <{2> <[2> children </[2> sing and dance 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#234:1:A>
<[1> Uh uhm </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#240:1:A>
<[2> Okay </[2> </{2> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#242:1:B>
So by that time the nieces were growing up and the nieces and the nephews were there
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#243:1:B>
So it was their turn already
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#244:1:B>
There would always be a short program for whose ever birthday it was and yes a lot of eating drinking and laughing

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#245:1:A>
So he was very I can say that he was very <foreign> viva </foreign> <{> <[> <,> </[> person
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#248:1:A>
He enjoyed a lot <,> uhm <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#246:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#249:1:A>
So now we go to his uh he got sick right again sick
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#250:1:A>
How did this affect you your relationship with him when he

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#251:1:B>
It was really it was really hard to believe the first few years because he had always really just been going on and I thought nothing could really faze him
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#252:1:B>
I think the only time he had gotten really sick was he had a bypass in his early seventies
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#253:1:B>
And then in prison he got really really thin
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#254:1:B>
But it was hard to think of him getting sick 



<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#> Uhm the usual case it only really started showing I think in eighty-six
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#256:1:B>
Before although he would go for treatment he still had hair <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#257:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> And he would still go around
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#258:1:B>
In eighty-six he was appointed to the Committee on Human Rights and I was his confidential secretary at that time
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#259:1:B>
And like there were fact-finding missions he <.> wa </.> he was scheduled to go and we couldn't go because he was too ill
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#260:1:B>
And that was the only time we really saw it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#261:1:A>
How did that affect him as a person
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#262:1:A>
Did he say I 'm sick and you know I 'm I 'm just gonna give up now 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#263:1:B>
No I think he he tried to fight it as much as he could
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#264:1:B>
Uhm like he would uh he would promise like he would you know get up on certain days and in fact uh I have a notebook of his I got it after he died 'cause he said he had his penmanship really suffered
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#266:1:B>
He had great penmanship and when he got sick he couldn't write
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#267:1:B>
It wasn't as clear
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#268:1:B>
And he told himself he was going to learn how to write again
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#269:1:B>
So he asked me to buy him one of the you know those writing notebooks <{> <[> <,> </[> with the blue line the red line the blue line
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#272:1:B>
And I got it after he died
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#273:1:B>
'Cause I said Mom you know can I have this 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#274:1:B>
So I thought it hadn't been used until I noticed at the bottom corner of each page he had written a big A a small A a big D and he was he had full real intentions of practicing
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#275:1:B>
Unfortunately I don't think he ever really got to the fourth page
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#276:1:B>
He was sick
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#277:1:B>
He got really tired when he was really really sick he got tired a lot

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#270:1:A>
<[> Uh uhm </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#278:1:A>
What about you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#279:1:A>
How did you take this

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#280:1:B>
It was it was very hard
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#281:1:B>
It was hard to see him that way 'cause knowing how he had been the years before and how quick his mind was
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#282:1:B>
It was painful for me to see him like that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-010#283:1:B>
So I knew it was probably painful for him though he never really said he never told us 

 </I>
