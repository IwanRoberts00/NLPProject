CREATE lovely flowers out of fruits and vegetables.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#6:1>
The floral figures can make interesting conversation pieces during
parties or family gatherings.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#7:1>
Sure, it 's not as easy as 1-2-3, and it may take a while before you
attain perfection, not to mention that you may have to suffer a few cuts here
and there, but it 's a craft well worth it if you 're patient and diligent
enough to learn. </p>

<quote> &ldquo; Once you learn the basics of carving, you can
carve anything as long as the material is adaptable, &rdquo; </quote> says
Suwattee &ldquo; Kun Mem &rdquo; Teerapath, chef of the Benjarong Royal Thai
Restaurant, Dusit Hotel Nikko ( tel. +63 2 867-3333). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#9:1>
It was 25 years ago when Teerapath first saw a co-worker in a Thai
hotel restaurant carving a fruit.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#10:1>
Fascinated by the art, she took it upon herself to master the craft.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#11:1>
That same day, she took home a watermelon and began cutting and
slicing and carving. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#12:1>
<quote> &ldquo; It took me three months to learn the basics of
carving.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#13:1>
The finished product wasn't really that good yet.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#14:1>
But when I finally found my mettle, I began experimenting, &rdquo;
</quote> she says. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#15:1>
<h> <bold> Aptitude </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#16:1>
She says the best fruit to work on for beginners is the papaya.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#17:1>
The watermelon 's texture is too soft and watery, especially for
fledgling carvers who still have to feel the <foreign> m&eacute;tier
</foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#18:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Fruits are generally easier than vegetables, &rdquo;
</quote> she says.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#19:1>
Carved vegetables can last for about a week, while fruits such as
watermelon, three days.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#20:1>
Both fruits and veggies need to be wrapped and chilled every day.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#21:1>
Teerapath accepts orders for fruit, vegetable and even soap
carving, mostly from regular clients of the Benjarong restaurant who are
amused by the soap carvings displayed on the tables.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#22:1>
Some companies even call on her to do fruit and vegetable carving for
their get-togethers or parties.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#23:1>
The price of fruit and vegetable carving varies from season to
season. </p> <&> Pictures in the article are accompanied by these captions
</&>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#24:1>
1. PEEL off the skin from one side of the watermelon with a knife.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#25:1>
2. MAKE a small, circular outline at the center of the peeled side of
the fruit using a razor-sharp carving knife.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#26:1>
This is where the first few petals will be carved.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#27:1>
3. TO FORM a petal, first make a short, thin layer in zigzag manner
to mimic a flower 's uneven curves.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#28:1>
Then cut a thick layer beside it, still in zigzag manner, to make way
for another petal and to create a space between them.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#29:1>
4. WHEN the flower in the small circle is done, create smaller
flowers by carving an oblong outline around it.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#30:1>
Work on the smaller flower within the oblong using the same
procedure.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#31:1>
Continue carving until one side of the watermelon is done. </I>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#36:2>
FOR TEERAPATH, carving has become a habit, a second nature of
sorts.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#37:2>
While some Filipinas probably cross-stitch or do crochet while
watching TV, Teerapath carves soaps instead.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#38:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Carving makes me happy.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#39:2>
I enjoy the craft so much that when I was in Thailand, every time my
husband drove me to work and we got stuck in traffic I carved soaps, &rdquo;
</quote> she says. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#40:2>
The tricky part is carving soaps as they vary in consistency,
depending on the chemical ingredients.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#41:2>
So Teerapath uses &ldquo; homemade &rdquo; soaps in varying colors
instead, available in most department stores in the metropolis.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#42:2>
To make soaps easier to carve, Teerapath melts them in slow fire
until they 're in liquid form; she then molds them into blocks.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#43:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Just add a little amount of water when melting soaps.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#44:2>
Once they 're completely melted, stop the fire or else the soap will
turn black, &rdquo; </quote> she says. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#45:2>
A bunch of about 20 soap flowers starts at 1,500 pesos, including
arrangement and makeshift vase. </p> <&> Pictures in article are accompanied
by these captions </&>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#46:2>
1. CUT a block of soap in half, then carve to a cone-like shape.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#47:2>
Work on the thin part first.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#48:2>
( For roses, form a round shape instead, with a thicker bottom.)

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#49:2>
2. SLICE thin layers from top to bottom to form petals.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#50:2>
Make sure to form each petal one over the other.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#51:2>
3. GENTLY bend the petals.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#52:2>
Depending on the type of flower, you can opt to bend the petals
either all the way down, halfway through or just around the tip.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#53:2>
4. TO PERFECTLY form the petals, trim the tips in accordance to the
flower you are creating - rose, lily, etc.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#54:2>
Using the tip of the carving knife, create ridges if desired.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#55:2>
Work on the inner petals by carefully slicing around the inside of
the petals.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#56:2>
Bend the petals if desired, but remember to gradually close the
petals as you get near the center of the flower.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#57:2>
Trim the tips of the petals. </I>

<h> <bold> Meet the new year with a mini waterfall garden </bold>
</h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#59:3>
Posted: 8:52 PM ( Manila Time) | January 17, 2002

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#60:3>
<bold> By Tita Giron </bold>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#61:3>
<bold> Inquirer News Service </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#62:3>
PLANT arts expert Serapion Mettilla has added something new to
the current craze in water gardening.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#63:3>
Instead of the usual mini waterfalls with imitation rocks and
artificial plants, he has come up with landscaped waterfalls using natural
materials. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#64:3>
Several artificial mini waterfalls and small table fountains have
been showing up in the market because of the positive influence they 're
supposed to bring, as popularized by <foreign> feng shui </foreign> and
<foreign> Zen </foreign> advocates. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#65:3>
Unlike the usual mini waterfalls with imitation rocks, stones,
and artificial plants, Metilla 's works are made of volcanic rocks, cinders,
and clay.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#66:3>
He uses live plants and miniature trees, the secret elements that
give his waterfall gardens a distinct touch of nature. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#67:3>
Of course, Metilla 's know-how in <foreign> bonsai </foreign>
culture and plant arts makes the difference.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#68:3>
We can tell.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#69:3>
Over the last 30 years or so, we 've listened to his countless
lectures, followed his gardening columns and saw his different plant art
works. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#70:3>
His recent lecture-demonstration on waterfall gardens has no
doubt drawn a lot of interest.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#71:3>
One prominent lady, for instance, was said to have been so impressed
that she ordered several pieces to give friends last Christmas. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#72:3>
And listen to this.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#73:3>
A jet engine instructor from the US happened to watch him demonstrate
the making of waterfall gardens during the recent <foreign> Ikebana
</foreign> International exhibit at Intercon Hotel.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#74:3>
Weeks later, Metilla received a letter from the jet engineer who
enclosed a photo of the waterfall he made at home in the US with his son,
based on Metilla 's instructions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#75:3>
The engineer thanked Metilla.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#76:3>
It was fun making the waterfall, he wrote.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#77:3>
He added that it saved him a lot of money because table waterfalls
being sold at US shops now cost 175 dollars and up.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#78:3>
According to the jet engineer, he only spent 8 dollars for lava rocks
and 15 dollars for the submersible water pump.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#79:3>
The rest of the materials were either free or inexpensive, including
the water catchment pond that he improvised with a birdbath. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#80:3>
<h> <bold> Waterfall soothes the spirit </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#81:3>
<quote> &ldquo; There is nothing like the sound of waterfall to
soothe a tired body, &rdquo; </quote> Metilla said.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#82:3>
He added that moving water improves air quality in the environment
and helps reduce pollution produced by car emissions, smoke, and other
pollutants. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#83:3>
<quote> &ldquo; The sight and sound of a gentle waterfall is
conducive to meditation.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#84:3>
It is a perfect focal point for contemplation, &rdquo; </quote> he
added. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#85:3>
It is also believed to attract luck, which is why mini waterfalls
and ponds are usually located near the entrance of buildings.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#86:3>
In <foreign> feng shui </foreign> , water is one of the most valuable
component of a meditation garden, whether it is a fountain, a pond, or a
gentle waterfall.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#87:3>
<quote> &ldquo; The water movement is important and should not make a
loud gushing or torrential sound to distract one 's contemplation, &rdquo;
</quote> he pointed out. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#88:3>
Metilla also said that besides the possible luck it brings, the
waterfall is a welcome sight for the tired mind and body. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#89:3>
<h> <bold> Materials needed </bold> </h> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#90:3>
- Volcanic rock, preferably irregular in form, is the choice of
Metilla.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#91:3>
Customers have a choice from heights ranging two feet to six feet.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#92:3>
- Clay may be store-bought or dug from the garden.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#93:3>
This is needed to cover roots of plants and to hold them secure on
the rock until the roots are able to establish plants.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#94:3>
- Submersible pump, also called circulating motor.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#95:3>
They vary according to power required by the size of the rock and the
waterfall.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#96:3>
- Concrete basin or water catchment may be rectangular, round, oval,
or irregular.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#97:3>
It should be deep enough to contain rock and water.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#98:3>
Metilla chooses containers with irregular shape to complement the
natural contour of the volcanic rock.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#99:3>
- Clay, compost, cement, sand, hose, and wire.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#100:3>
- Planting materials should be small, of varying height, and are
tolerant of humid and shade area.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#101:3>
For rock cover and niche fillers, he plants small ferns, ivy,
<foreign> mondo </foreign> grass, lichens and mosses.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#102:3>
To create height perspective, he opts for <foreign> bonsai
</foreign> trees, miniature <foreign> ti </foreign> plants, <foreign>
syngonium </foreign> , philodendron, and other plants that tolerate shady and
humid locations.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#103:3>


<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#104:3>
- Length and size of hose will depend on the size and power of
submersible pump, also the height of rock.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#105:3>
Ideally, Metilla uses l/2 inch diameter hose.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#106:3>
- For his tools, Metilla uses electric drill, hammer, chisel or any
hard object that can be used to carve the rock. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#107:3>
<h> <bold> Procedure </bold> </h> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#108:3>
After cleaning the volcanic rock and chiseling the rough edges,
Metilla uses the electric drill to make holes from the rock 's back to the
top where the waterfall is supposed to start.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#109:3>
He inserts the water hose originating from the pump through the hole
and holds it in place with cement. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#110:3>
<quote> &ldquo; For a natural look, use either black or red
cement that blends with the color of the volcanic rock, &rdquo; </quote>
Metilla advises. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#111:3>
Water pressure is important to control the flow of water and to
contain it within the catch basin.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#112:3>
The ideal container for a 2.5 feet rock is four inches deep, 2.5
feet long, and can contain six gallons of water.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#113:3>
<quote> &ldquo; It is also very important to keep the pump
underwater so it does not overheat, &rdquo; </quote> Metilla cautioned. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#114:3>
Having positioned the rock on top of the container, Metilla
landscapes the rock.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#115:3>
The roots of <foreign> Ficus </foreign> or <indig> balete </indig>
are inserted into deep crevices filled with compost and covered with live
moss.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#116:3>
<quote> &ldquo; <foreign> Ficus </foreign> trees have deep
penetrating roots that anchor them to rocks, &rdquo; </quote> he explained.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#117:3>
His other choices are mini <foreign> melendres </foreign> ,
bougainvillea and powder puff trees. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#118:3>
After planting the bigger materials, he covers the rock surface
with carpet moss, lichens, and ferns.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#119:3>
The bases are held in place by clay. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#120:3>
Newly landscaped waterfall gardens are sheltered for the first
few days in a shady but well-lighted place.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#121:3>
Keep it well-watered until the plants are established. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#122:3>
<quote> &ldquo; Be guided by the photo of a waterfall garden if
you have no idea how it looks like, &rdquo; </quote> Metilla tells beginners.
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#123:3>
<h> <bold> Maintenance </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#124:3>
<quote> &ldquo; Place your waterfall garden in a location with
bright light, but not under direct sunlight.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#125:3>
You can bring them indoors in a well-lighted area for five days,
maximum.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#126:3>
See that the container is filled with water and the pump is well
submerged. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#127:3>
For folks who want to keep the waterfall garden indoors, here is
Metilla 's suggestion: <quote> &ldquo; Provide the plants with ultraviolet
lights, the same lights used for aquariums.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#128:3>
Place bulbs overhead, about one foot away from plants.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#129:3>
In the evening before you retire to bed, it is advisable to unplug
the pump 's motor. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#130:3>
His parting shot, <quote> &ldquo; Keep the waterfall out of the
children 's reach.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#131:3>
And, don't forget that the motor is submerged under water.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#132:3>
Be sure the plug does not get wet, or it could cause electrocution.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-013#133:3>
Metilla will demonstrate his waterfall garden during the
Philippine Horticulture Society anniversary garden show at Manila Seedling
Bank starting Jan. 25. </p>
