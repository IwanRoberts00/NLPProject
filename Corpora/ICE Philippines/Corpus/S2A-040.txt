<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#1:1:A>
Okay can you hear me
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#2:1:A>
Uhm I think that it 's very difficult for people to to just listen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#3:1:A>
Uh I think we 've spent too much of our time in classrooms where all the teachers gave us was the talk talk talk talk so I think I 'll just stay here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#4:1:A>
This morning uh before we even begin to think about the possibilities for early childhood development in the media I would like to put a put it in a proper context <indig> 'no </indig> in terms of the relationship of children and media
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#5:1:A>
Because as an educator I still think that nothing takes the place of hands-on parenting and hands-on teaching especially for young children
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#6:1:A>
So let me qualify with that premise right away
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#7:1:A>
At its best any form of media television radio CD-ROMs <indig> 'no </indig> books can only be a supplementary learning tool
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#8:1:A>
And uh in that way we have to put it in its proper place
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#9:1:A>
It can't work miracles
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#10:1:A>
It can only be like a good book a good an additional resource for a parent
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#11:1:A>
But the children today are growing up in an environment where media plays different roles for them
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#12:1:A>
It 's been called the surrogate parent
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#13:1:A>
It 's also <unclear> word </unclear> for the youth considered a touchstone by which they define their standards
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#14:1:A>
And recent studies among Metro Manila youth and even the the nineteen ninety-six survey of the S W S among Filipino youth bares this out <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#15:1:A>
They spend more time watching television listening to the radio than they do interacting with their own parents
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#16:1:A>
And these are the youth from the ages of fifteen to twenty-four
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#17:1:A>
Uhm we could also consider some some Filipino youth who are in urban centers as trekkers of the information superhighway
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#18:1:A>
And we like to think that Filipino children belong to a global village <indig> 'no </indig> but how how actively they are participating in that I I would question later on
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#19:1:A>
How do parents use the media <,> maybe this also tells us how children especially now in urban centers spend more time than they should watching television <,> and what 's on television <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#21:1:A>
Filipino children spend an average of three to four hours a day watching T V <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#22:1:A>
This is a cartoon but it 's actually correct data because yes by the age of six that 's about the number of times a child would see murders
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#23:1:A>
Our organization has just completed a study monitoring content of children 's television for the last year
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#24:1:A>
And both advertising and day time television contains not only a lot of violence but also a lot of sex sex sexist uh gratuitous or something that is beyond what is uh appropriate for children to deal with okay <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#25:1:A>
What 's the media landscape like for Filipino children
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#26:1:A>
We we say that they are uh media users we say that they 're media consumers <,> okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#27:1:A>
If this if we were to take a look at it this is how it 's like 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#> Sixty percent of our youth are in the rural areas and what they have access to would be radio T V and V C Rs which which we should not be taking for granted <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#29:1:A>
I was in Ifugao just recently and uhm in the <indig> sari-sari </indig> store in the <foreign> poblacion </foreign> I had behind me several grade schoolers borrowing <indig> aksiyon pahiram nga ng aksiyon </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#30:1:A>
So <indig> pagtingin ko ano 'yung aksiyon 'yung mga </indig> Ramon Revilla Bong Revilla movies <indig> 'no </indig> all the violent kinds of Filipino movies
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#32:1:A>
So they 're no longer sheltered from those kinds of action movies they call them
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#33:1:A>
In urban centers you have everything <indig> 'no </indig> there 's access
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#34:1:A>
Of course this this would depend on the socio-economic group okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#35:1:A>
In terms of access to channels we now live in a world of multi-channels we have many options <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#36:1:A>
Cable is increasingly more popular among the middle class and upper class students or children
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#37:1:A>
Uhm teenagers take in thirty hours of broadcast media and spend much less time reading okay <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#38:1:A>
There are four four hundred ten T V programs now on air
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#39:1:A>
Eighty-nine only are considered children 's programs
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#40:1:A>
It 's a very skewed uh balance <indig> dito </indig> uh for this ratio because children spend more time watching than adults
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#41:1:A>
But even when we were working on the Children 's Television Act with Secretary Escudero the K B P was strongly against the provision to to compel uh all broadcasters to allocate fifteen percent of air time
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#42:1:A>
By the time we got to the Senate so <indig> nakalusot 'yan sa </indig> House <indig> kasi pinilit ng mga </indig> Congressmen by the time we got to the Senate on the last before the bicameral conference they were still at it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#44:1:A>
Finally I said you say you value Filipino children
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#45:1:A>
When you say form these organizations these networks because you uh value the quality of T V that should be given to Filipino children but it 's lip service because you refuse to give even that fifteen percent
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#47:1:A>
So <indig> sabi ko puede ba ibalato na lang natin 'yan sa batang Pilipino </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#48:1:A>
But until now that 's still a thorny point <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#49:1:A>
So uh it 's still a question of how much time and what there is for children <,> okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#50:1:A>
Filipino kids watch twenty to twenty-eight hours a week which means a thousand up to one thousand thirty-four hours per year so by the age of thirty they would have spent four to five years of their lives watching television
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#52:1:A>
What a waste if what they see on television is like the cartoon I showed you wasteful okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#53:1:A>
So what about content <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#54:1:A>
What does television have to offer our children
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#55:1:A>
In our monitoring study that we did on what what children have now aside from the fact that seventy percent are imported meaning mostly American second Japanese cartoons uhm dubbed also in Filipino okay the others are <.> re </.> they 're mostly really the kinds of cartoons that are <indig> 'yung </indig> wacky type <indig> 'yung </indig> Looney Tunes type
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#57:1:A>
They 're the ones which the U C L A study a national television study did in the U S in in by it it 's the biggest national study of its kind they are the cartoons which are considered violent
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#59:1:A>
<indig> 'Yung mga maya't-maya merong napipisa o kaya nadadaanan ng pison o sumasabog 'yun </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#60:1:A>
Uhm it 's not a problem if you 're dealing with children seven and above but if you 're dealing with children five and below and they have an overdose of those kinds of cartoons then you are in effect desensitizing them to that kind of physical aggression
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#61:1:A>
That 's the for me the biggest problem in violence in television is not the fact that there is violence because if violence has a context our own historical struggle as a people is very violent <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#62:1:A>
In <indig> Batibot </indig> we had to uhm to show Filipino ethics and there 's no avoiding the violent the conflict because that is the story of our that 's our collective history as a people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#63:1:A>
But there is a context
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#64:1:A>
Bloodshed had a context
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#65:1:A>
And there 's also a way of deemphasizing it rather than making it the major part of the story
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#66:1:A>
So the biggest danger really of children 's continued exposure to violence is that they become desensitized to it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#67:1:A>
That it becomes a normal fact of life
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#68:1:A>
That it becomes the one best solution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#69:1:A>
And so how do we deal with it if the content is uhm overtly violent or overtly sexual and children can take can only look at it out of context
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#70:1:A>
We have to take a pro-active stance and that 's what we 're trying to do in the last many years <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#72:1:A>
Uhm <indig> Batibot </indig> was born after <mention> Sesame </mention> the Philippine co-production of the Children 's Television Workshop had to go to sleep or we had to put it to bed because the nineteen eighty-three political and economic crisis did not make it tenable to keep uh paying the Children 's Television Workshop all those dollars <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#73:1:A>
So we looked at one another and said <indig> sayang 'yung natutunan natin </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#74:1:A>
So let 's go for it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#75:1:A>
Premature but let 's give birth to a premature baby and nurture it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#76:1:A>
So far <indig> Batibot </indig> is on its fifteenth year
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#77:1:A>
And so we 've literally helped to rear to nurture a generation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#78:1:A>
And uhm now I still meet college students as I 'm invited to speak to different groups and they tell me I grew up with <indig> Batibot </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#79:1:A>
And I ask them what was it that made it uhm you know meaningful to you or relevant to you
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#80:1:A>
Many of them were saying that it taught me that I could be proud to be a Filipino 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#81:1:A>
And I think if only for that we 've accomplished what we set out to accomplish
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#82:1:A>
<indig> Hindi ako nahiya magsalita ng Tagalog o ng Filipino </indig> okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#83:1:A>
I know that now and FUSE specialists are very concerned about uhm the problem with English learning
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#84:1:A>
As an educator and especially in terms of early childhood development one of the most important developmental milestones is language learning
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#85:1:A>
And it is an asset for cognitive development if an individual has a dominant language even if you are going to be <.> mul </.> multilingual
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#86:1:A>
I I can take myself as an example
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#87:1:A>
I think I 'm quite fluent in English
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#88:1:A>
I speak two other languages in addition
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#89:1:A>
But my language is Filipino
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#90:1:A>
My parents brought us up to speak Filipino in the household <indig> kasi nagkataon pareho silang Tagalog </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#91:1:A>
If we were maybe Ilonggos we would have spoken Ilonggo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#92:1:A>
But they felt strongly that we should have a good grounding
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#93:1:A>
And that grounding was important for cognitive development as I later learned in in my undergraduate and graduate courses
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#94:1:A>
Why because you have a conceptual base
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#96:1:A>
Language and thought are too closely interrelated
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#97:1:A>
If the language of the environment is your predominant language is also your dominant language then it is <.> mo </.> easier for you to strengthen that conceptual base
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#98:1:A>
<indig> Hindi ka lito </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#99:1:A>
I have worked with college students who could not write a complete sentence U P <indig> ito </indig> who could not write a complete sentence in either English or Filipino
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#100:1:A>
And I would say to them <indig> mag-desisyon ka nga </indig> choose one language and use it but use it well okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#102:1:A>
And I think uhm if we give our younger children a firm base in Filipino from which to understand <indig> 'no para maging </indig> framework <indig> nila </indig> for understanding not only other languages but especially mathematics especially science which are really uh heavily reliant on cognitive skills then we give them a firm foundation for literacy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#103:1:A>
And we give them a firm foundation for critical thinking
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#104:1:A>
And that is why the choice of Filipino for <indig> Batibot </indig> many years ago was deliberate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#105:1:A>
It was not just a nationalistic fervor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#106:1:A>
I was fully convinced as an educator that I must help we must help lay a firm foundation for that conceptual framework for that base from which children will make sense of their world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#107:1:A>
Language and thought the two most interesting and most critical uhm tools that only human beings have
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#108:1:A>
That 's the only thing that sets us apart really from the rest of the animal kingdom
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#109:1:A>
And every generation of young children must reinvent <indig> 'no </indig> the use of that language
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#110:1:A>
So uh that explains why until now if you think that <indig> Batibot </indig> should be in Filipino
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#111:1:A>
We 've developed a Filipino Chinese program called <mention> Pin-pin </mention> to teach Hokkien <indig> 'no </indig> to Filipino Chinese
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#112:1:A>
We are working on a program that will be for older children seven and above that will be about media literacy and that will be bilingual
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#113:1:A>
Because we then I think from seven onwards it 's important to teach in a very systematic way both English and Filipino to complement the school system
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#114:1:A>
But we give them that strong base 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#> Also it would be very incongruous to teach children for example among the goals of of <indig> Batibot </indig> uhm is to teach children to value what it is to be Filipino okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#115:1:A>
We want to teach them that uhm you can have a positive self-esteem and share it with other Filipinos <,> by appreciating first of all knowing knowing
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#116:1:A>
For example there are children or even adults who tell me <indig> 'yung bubot pala trumpo 'yun </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#117:1:A>
<indig> Alam n'yo ba 'yun 'yung bubot </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#119:1:A>
<indig> Bubot </indig> is a top
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#120:1:A>
It 's a top that Ifugao children make
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#121:1:A>
And <indig> sabi nila sa Batibot lang nila 'yan natutunan </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#122:1:A>
Or certain words like uh in nineteen eighty-five to eighty-seven we approached the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and we and told them you want to reach more people at the time when it wasn't really in fashion yet to be pro-environment and to teach about protecting the environment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#123:1:A>
We said let 's do something on <indig> Batibot </indig> okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#124:1:A>
Uhm four years later so first we started with introducing some basic concepts and we looked at the most severe environmental problems
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#125:1:A>
First <?> we teach </?> is domestic waste
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#126:1:A>
<indig> 'Yan ang </indig> main problem <indig> natin talaga 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-040#127:1:A>
We are probably uh the most inefficient and really uncaring in in dealing with our waste 

 </I>
