<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#2:1>
<h> <bold> The Funeral </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#3:1>
THE MORTICIAN complained that he had the most difficult time
making Gil Alvarez 's face presentable for viewing.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#4:1>
Gil 's face had three bullet holes.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#5:1>
The pale mortician related how he tried wrapping a handkerchief around
Gil 's neck and pulling it up to cover the blown-off jaw.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#6:1>
He combed Alvarez 's hair over the bullet hole on the forehead.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#7:1>
But he couldn't do a thing about the neat little bullet hole in the
cheek.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#8:1>
He tried bandaging Alvarez 's face, but that made him look like a
mummy displayed in some cheap carnival.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#9:1>
Besides, it only called more attention to the fact that the poor
Governor 's face was riddled with holes.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#10:1>
In sheer desperation, the mortician had even tried putting a flower
into the hole in the cheek, which covered the hole all right, but a gardenia
sitting in the middle of a man 's face was disconcerting to say the very
least.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#11:1>
Finally, he threw his hands up in the air, sighed, <quote> &ldquo;
<indig> <it> Bahala na! </it> </indig> - - What the hell-- &rdquo; </quote>
and applied makeup and powder on Alvarez 's face.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#12:1>
He covered up the holes in the neck and forehead as he had planned,
and left the hole in the cheek exposed.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#13:1>
Gil Alvarez appeared that way in his open casket that sat in the
middle aisle of San Antonio church. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#14:1>
To symbolize Gil Alvarez 's spilled blood, the Virgins had said
they would decorate the church in red and white.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#15:1>
They discussed what sort of flowers they would use on the altar,
along the aisle, and on the church pillars.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#16:1>
So caught up were they with the arrangements--a job they were often
called upon to do--that they completely forgot they could not order roses,
dahlias, daisies, chrysanthemums from distant Baguio.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#17:1>
They scoured the town and came up with white gardenias and ferns, but
it was impossible to find red flowers.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#18:1>
Stuck with what Taytayan had to offer, which wasn't very much, the
Virgins eventually figured out a way of stripping the green portions of
<indig> gabi </indig> leaves so only the red part showed.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#19:1>
While the women fluttered about installing the bouquets in the
church, they talked about Cristobal.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#20:1>
It seemed, according to the scandalized Petra, that he had started
touching certain parts of his body.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#21:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I caught him in the act, &rdquo; </quote> she said,
indignation dripping from each word.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#22:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Fondling himself. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#23:1>
Mama and I were helping them and my mother paused and stared at
Petra 's sparse hair that stuck up in different angles.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#24:1>
<quote> &ldquo; If fondling himself makes that poor boy feel better,
let him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#25:1>
He 's lost everything after all, &rdquo; </quote> she said, leaving
Petra glassy-eyed and Meding philosophical. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#26:1>
I had seen Mama afraid; I had seen her stand up against the
Japanese soldier in Mindanao; I had seen her force herself to put on a
cheerful front to weather our difficulties; I had seen Mama harangue God and
the saints with her prayers.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#27:1>
Gil 's funeral shook whatever composure Mama had.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#28:1>
She wept on my father 's shoulders.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#29:1>
<quote> &ldquo; It 's all gone.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#30:1>
It 's dead.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#31:1>
We 've lost it.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#32:1>
It 'll never be back again, &rdquo; </quote> she wailed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#33:1>
I did not know what she meant until I heard the other women
during the funeral Mass.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#34:1>
Women from all over Ubec traveled through enemy territory to catch a
last glimpse of Gil Alvarez, the man they had adored in their teen-age years.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#35:1>
Crying, they talked about how Alvarez symbolized their youth, and how
his death signalled the unquestionable end of the days when they laughed and
<foreign> rhumbaed </foreign> and jitter-bugged--those days along with
Alvarez had turned into dust whipping in the dry wind, they cried.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#36:1>
They mourned for the death that happened in their souls. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#37:1>
When the women saw Gil Alvarez 's face, when they saw Cristobal,
kneeling quietly ( loaded with Meding 's pink medicine)--a carbon copy of his
Olympiad father--Ubec 's demigod if not Ubec 's god--the women could not
contain their deep sorrow and rage.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#38:1>
All the sufferings they had accumulated through the war years, all
the humiliation they bore, and which they lifted up to God-- <quote> God 's
Will be done </quote> - - welled up and burst like a dam in the ancient stone
church.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#39:1>
The old Spanish friar--deaf and barely with the living--had never in
his entire sixty years of sacerdotal activities witnessed such passion.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#40:1>
Fearing the women would tear the casket apart, tear Gil Alvarez apart
for pieces of his flesh to use in precious reliquaries, he hastened the
funeral Mass. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#41:1>
Later, ten women pushed away the men who lifted Gil 's coffin,
and they ( with black veils covering their faces) carried him all the way to
the cemetery, instead of using the tired black funeral car that looked like a
worn bat and that often stalled in the middle of De Leon Avenue, anyway.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#42:1>
Four women tore their hair and strewed them along the way like black
confetti. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#43:1>
It was foolish, but lurking inside of me was the hope that Gil
would come back to life as Doc Mendez had.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#44:1>
My intellect knew, just by the sight of the hole on his cheek, that
he was dead--Gil Alvarez 's corpse really looked terrible.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#45:1>
But a part of me clung to the idea that some miracle could happen.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#46:1>
All these people, all the tears, surely God would grant us another
miracle.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#47:1>
But beyond the excessive display of mourning, nothing unusual
occurred.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#48:1>
When Gil 's casket grated its way into the niche and the marble
marker was put in place with a dull thud, I finally accepted that there would
be no miracle this time.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#49:1>
Gil was dead.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#50:1>
This realization was punctuated by the fainting of two women. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#51:1>
Later, spent, so thoroughly spent, the mourners gathered at the
Virgins ' house for the funeral meal which Meding and Petra so very kindly
prepared.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#52:1>
Over the wartime extravagance of fine white rice, roast pig,
barbecued chickens, and fruit-of-the-gods salad, people spoke unabashedly of
Gil 's magnificence, while Cristobal locked himself in his bedroom and lay on
the bed, wetting himself from grief. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#53:1>
I DETECTED a change in my father.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#54:1>
What pained him most went beyond the loss of Gil Alvarez, and the
torture they endured as prisoners in Martin Lewis ' camp.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#55:1>
My father lost faith in Americans.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#56:1>
He had lived with them; he had known them and loved them.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#57:1>
But now he realized that a lot of what Gil Alvarez had said about
Americans was true.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#58:1>
And my father realized ( with a shock and sadness that a baby must
feel when severed from his mother 's umbilical cord) that Filipinos must
shape their destiny, that they were responsible for their future, that
America ( for all her verbal good intentions) watched out for herself and her
citizens first of all, even if this meant using other countries and peoples.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#59:1>
And so he and other men continued with the guerrilla warfare with an
intensity that had been lacking before.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#60:1>
They had always held back, waiting for MacArthur to return, waiting
for the Americans to liberate the Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#61:1>
But now no more.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#62:1>
If they would have to fight the Japanese for the next decade, or even
twenty years, then that was how it would be.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#63:1>
But they would continue fighting for Filipino freedom. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#64:1>
I MYSELF had developed an insecurity about my father.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#65:1>
I was always afraid he 'd suddenly disappear or die.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#66:1>
I touched him often, hung onto his arm, and sat beside him
constantly.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#67:1>
Even at night, I would awake with a sudden jerk, then I would go to
their room and shake him awake, to prove to myself that he was alive.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#68:1>
Once I prayed to God and without thinking, said, <quote> &ldquo;
Thank you, God, that it was Gil Alvarez who died, and not Papa. &rdquo;
</quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#69:1>
I paused, horrified at my words.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#70:1>
And then I felt bad.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#71:1>
Deep inside I had sensed that blood would be spilled; I had felt it.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#72:1>
But guilty as I felt, I was happy it was not my father 's blood. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#73:1>
ONE NIGHT I fell into a fitful sleep, but later I awoke to the
sound of a rhythmic thudding.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#74:1>
I felt disoriented.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#75:1>
At first I thought I was back in Ubec.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#76:1>
Then I realized I was in Taytayan but I thought Papa was still
missing.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#77:1>
I became frightened because the sound came from my parents ' room.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#78:1>
Hurrying to their room, I opened the door slightly.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#79:1>
The sound came from the headboard banging softly against the wall.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#80:1>
My father was on top of my mother.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#81:1>
They were making love, their eyes closed as they rocked regularly,
like the waves lapping the shore.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#82:1>
Moonlight streamed into the room and I could see a film of sweat on
Mama 's forehead.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#83:1>
Her mouth was half-open with desire, and Papa was on top of her,
loving her with a vibrancy I had never seen before.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#84:1>
His body moved rhythmically on top of hers.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#85:1>
They throbbed with life.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#86:1>
I felt a vivid sense of clarity that swept aside all sense of guilt
and misgivings: they were alive and I was alive. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#87:1>
<h> <bold> Chapter 25 </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#88:1>
<h> <bold> Liberation </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#89:1>
WHILE PAPA, Gil, and Max had been prisoners of Martin Lewis, Doc
had taken over the guerrilla leadership.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#90:1>
Being basically a non-violent person, it had gone against his grain
to actively participate in the fighting.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#91:1>
But he had talked it over with God, and there was no one else who
could head the Movement.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#92:1>
Hemming and hawing would have meant sure death for Papa, Gil, and
Max; it would have meant the collapse of Ubec 's guerrilla movement and total
Japanese control of the island, with a great loss of civilian lives.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#93:1>
And so Doc knew that God wanted him to be Ubec 's guerrilla head.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#94:1>
<quote> &ldquo; It is strange, &rdquo; </quote> he said, <quote>
&ldquo; how life shapes itself for you. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#95:1>
Curiously, once he became the movement 's leader, he lost his ability
to read people 's auras.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#96:1>
He muttered once about how this loss was <quote> &ldquo; payment
&rdquo; </quote> - - for what exactly, he never did elaborate. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#97:1>
Doc Mendez turned out to be as fine a soldier as he was a doctor.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#98:1>
Under his leadership, the <foreign> guerilleros </foreign> liberated
towns until three-quarters of the island of Ubec were in guerrilla hands.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#99:1>
Things were going bad for the Japanese, including a major setback
when Admiral Isoruku Yoshida died.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#100:1>
It was a strange circumstance--shortly after his return to the
Japanese, Yoshida contracted cholera after carelessly eating unwashed fruit.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#101:1>
People said, with a note of vengeance, that his death was meant to
be.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#102:1>
The Japanese found themselves confined to the city of Ubec, but they
still possessed superior arms and resisted the movement effectively.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#103:1>
Doc said it would take a long time for the movement to liberate Ubec
City; but with the Americans and their superior arms, Ubec would be liberated
in a matter of days.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#104:1>
His words proved correct. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#105:1>
IN TAYTAYAN, it was quiet from the time darkness set in until
the sun rose.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#106:1>
At dawn, in my room the first sounds that broke the silence were the
clip-clopping of a horse.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#107:1>
It was the old delivery man, with his fresh milk and white cheese.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#108:1>
This November morning, however, I awoke, not to the peaceful
clip-clopping, but to the rude shattering sound of gunshots. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#109:1>
I lifted the mosquito net, rolled to the floor and crawled under
the bed.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#110:1>
I stared out at the rosy sunlight that filtered into the bedroom to
figure out what was going on.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#111:1>
There was more shooting.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#112:1>
I thought to myself that the Japanese had invaded Taytayan and we
would all die.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#113:1>
I was making the sign of the cross when I heard people 's voices and
laughter.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#114:1>
Laughter--?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#115:1>
I crept to the window and peered out.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#116:1>
People were running up and down the sidewalk.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#117:1>
There were men and women dancing in the street, and down the road
marched a steady stream of American soldiers.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#118:1>
There was so much activity, so much joy.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#119:1>
I stood up to wave, but I felt my stomach cramp.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#120:1>
The pain was sharp and all I could do was crawl back to bed.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#121:1>
It was then I noticed bloodstains on the bed sheet and blood on my
nightgown.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#122:1>
I had been hit by a stray bullet, and I was dying. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#123:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Ma--Ma! &rdquo; </quote> I shouted. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#124:1>
Mama burst into my room.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#125:1>
<quote> &ldquo; What is it, Yvonne? &rdquo; </quote> She had on her
best dress, the same one she had worn in Mindanao when Gil Alvarez had supper
with us.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#126:1>
Before I could tell her about my terminal condition, she said,
<quote> &ldquo; Yvonne, Yvonne, they 're here!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#127:1>
The Americans are here! &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#128:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Ma, I 'm dying. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#129:1>
My mother 's Madonna eyes glinted when she spotted the blood
stains.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#130:1>
She checked me, then smiled.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#131:1>
<quote> &ldquo; You 're all right.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#132:1>
It 's just your period.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#133:1>
You 're now a woman.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#134:1>
Everything 's all right.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#135:1>
And the Americans have returned, with tanks and guns.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#136:1>
It took a long time, but the war 's over. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#137:1>
When she later left to join the impromptu celebration in the
streets, I sat by the window and watched the men shoot their guns into the
air and yell out loud profanities and prayers.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#138:1>
I saw Mama and Papa, Nida and Max, Doc, Bitong, and all the others
laughing, shouting.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#139:1>
I saw women--young and old--racing from one American soldier to
another, kissing the dazed Americans who were themselves overwhelmed at being
liberators of Taytayan.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#140:1>
Bewildered children stood by doorways not knowing what to make of
this human carnival. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#141:1>
A scene caught my eye, and I viewed this as if it were all in
slow motion.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#142:1>
There was a young woman, around twenty years old, wearing a filmy
white dress that fluttered about her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#143:1>
Her waist-length hair was braided down her back; her tanned skin
shone like gold.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#144:1>
She was enchanting, like some creature descended from the sky.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#145:1>
She ran from soldier to soldier, handing them a flower, kissing them
on the cheeks, her movements slow and fluid.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#146:1>
She approached a lanky young American soldier, and after smiling at
him, she tiptoed and kissed him on the cheek.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#147:1>
He was so stunned that he stood frozen with his hand on his cheek,
while he watched her disappear in the crowd. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#148:1>
The revelry continued for a long time and I imagined the virgins
watching from their balcony, clucking their tongues and predicting that there
would be a rash of half-American babies in Taytayan in nine months. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#149:1>
For that was what a woman did--she nurtured a child in her womb
for nine months, then released this human being into this world.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#150:1>
And I, my mother had just said, was now a woman. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#151:1>
I stood in front of the mirror and studied the reflection of the
scrawny girl with bony elbows sticking out.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#152:1>
Was that really I?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#153:1>
Had I grown four inches since the war broke out?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#154:1>
Had my round cheeks receded to reveal cheekbones that would make me
look like Mama one day?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#155:1>
I unbuttoned my nightgown and pulled it down so my chest was
exposed.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#156:1>
There were more ribs than breasts; but yes, they were slightly
swollen, no longer the flat breasts of a child.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#157:1>
I crossed my arms in front to cover myself.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#158:1>
A knowledge filtered into my brain that I was different, that I had
changed, that I would never again be the Yvonne of yesterday, of last year,
of the past.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#159:1>
I stood on some threshold, and where it led, I did not know.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-011#160:1>
I tried to smile bravely even as a lump of fear formed and caught in
my throat. </p> </I>
