For the past thirty-seven days of his captivity all Staff Sergeant Alpio Lozada did was walk day and night
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#9:1:C>
Today in a new polo shirt pants and rubber shoes he had his most cherished walk to freedom back in his family 's arms <&> a six second news clip </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#10:1:C>
It was an emotional reunion with his wife Winnie and five sons Aldwin Alpio the fourth Alfie Gilbert and Glenn Bryan
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#11:1:C>
The release was delayed by a few hours
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#12:1:C>
The road up the mountain was narrow and very rough hampered by heavy rains and mud
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#13:1:C>
From up the mountain I C R C Representative Olivier Genard received Lozada
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#14:1:C>

Lozada reveals he once tried but failed to escape
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#17:1:C>
He says he was treated fairly and humanely and that his detention opened his eyes to the reasons that drove his captors to rebellion <&> a twenty-one second news interview clip of Sgt Lozada </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#18:1:C>
The N P A charged Lozada with three cases of exploitation of women
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#19:1:C>
He admitted to only one and that his wife knew about it

The release of Staff Sergeant Lozada and that of Chief Inspector Bernal earlier in Sorsogon are mere dress rehearsals to the main event the release of General Obillo and Captain Montealto on April sixteen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#22:1:C>
But as everyone waits for that to happen many here are hoping the completion of the release process would pave the way for the resumption of the peace talks

Sergeant Alpio Lozada 's release went on smoothly
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#27:1:A>
There were no media or political hysterics that accompanied the release of Police Chief Inspector Roberto Bernal in Sorsogon
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#28:1:A>
But that 's all that was different
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#29:1:A>
Almost all local media or all media local and national were there
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#30:1:A>
And every local politician human rights and religious group wanted in
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#31:1:A>

Mrs Winifreda Lozada and her five boys were not taking chances
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#33:1:D>
With the release finally pushing through they were at the <foreign> Santo Ni&ntilde;o </foreign> Church in Anticala town Surigao del Sur by two in the morning well ahead of the scheduled six o'clock Mass <?> off </?> and nine o'clock pull-out set by the negotiating panel <&> a thirteen second news interview clip of <indig> Aling </indig> Winnie </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#35:1:D>
But by six o'clock as Bishop Ireneo Amantillo led a special Thanksgiving Mass for Lozada 's release the family was still waiting
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#36:1:D>
The negotiating panel and N D F representatives were nowhere in sight
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#37:1:D>
Not that there was a lack of representative
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#38:1:D>
Just as with the release of Bernal Lozada 's became a fiesta of sorts
with everyone or anyone wanting the exposure around <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#40:1:D>
We counted three mayors a governor various councilors <indig> barangay </indig> chairmen about five religious and human rights groups heads of several civic and people 's organizations and of course the media who from daybreak never seem to get enough of the Lozada family
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#41:1:D>
It was near ten in the morning when the negotiating panel pulled in and the caravan of twenty vehicles pulled out for the fifteen kilometer journey up the forest and mountains of Barrio Biatogon in Anticala where members of the N P A 's <indig> Pulang Diwa </indig> Command waited
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#43:1:D>
For a while it seemed media would only have Mrs Lozada and the boys to harass
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#44:1:D>
By then even politicians wanted a chance to be seen next to the captive the rebel and the whole scene
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#45:1:D>
Even when the <w> rebels' </w> short program ended by two o'clock the Lozada family were still not spared as they were taken on a chopper ride to another presscon <&> =press conference </&> this led by the A F P

<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#54:1:E>
Atty Swift and Rob Domingo declined to give interviews
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#55:1:E>
That 's because all lawyers in the class action suit have been prohibited by U S District Court Judge Manuel Real to make any statements about the case
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#56:1:E>
Meantime Counsel for <w> claimants' </w> group SELDA Romeo Capulong says the members find the one hundred fifty-one million dollars as settlement acceptable but they 're still protesting the rescreening of the claimants and the objectionable provisions in the agreement <&> a fourteen second news interview clip of Atty Capulong </&>

Rosales however says lawyers like Edcel Lagman and Rene Saguisag assure her that clause does not give the Marcoses immunity from charges of human rights violations <&> a fourteen second news interview clip of Cong Rosales </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#58:1:E>

Malaca&ntilde;ang is being urged to reinstitutionalize the special committee created by President Estrada to review the death verdict imposed on three men convicted of killing a policeman during a nineteen ninety-four passenger bus robbery in Caloocan
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#82:1:A>
Composed of Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas and Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Magdangal Elma the special panel was created to review the case of robbery and homicide convicts Dante Piandong Jesus Morallos and Archie Bulan
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#83:1:A>
They were set to be put to death by lethal injection last Wednesday but Mr Estrada ordered a ninety-day stay of their execution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#84:1:A>
Congressman Roan Libarios says the Presidential panel should be tasked to oversee the review of all affirmed death verdicts not just the case of the three cop killers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#85:1:A>
But Congressman Ernesto Herrera says it is important for the death <w> convicts' </w> defense counsel to present new evidence within the ninety-day reprieve otherwise the executions must push through <,> <&> a sixteen second news interview clip of Cong Herrera </&> <,>

Deputy Speaker Eduardo Gullas says there is no compelling need for the country 's three oil companies to increase pump prices at this time
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#93:1:B>
Gullas says the oil firms have already started to recover from their losses and sees no justifiable need for them to resort to price increases in the near future
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#94:1:B>
He points out that Petron Corporation Caltex Philippines and <indig> Pilipinas </indig> Shell Petroleum netted an aggregate net income of six point one billion pesos in nineteen ninety-eight a big turn-around from their combined four point forty-three billion pesos net loss in nineteen ninety-seven
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#95:1:B>
Starting next week the oil companies are expected to raise pump prices by an average of fifty centavos per liter following an up trend in world oil prices
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#96:1:B>
The uptrend was an offshoot of a decision of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to scale down crude oil production 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#> As a rule of thumb local uh prices go up thirty centavos per liter for every dollar increase in oil prices abroad

Caloocan City Mayor Reynaldo Malonzo denies accusations that he is responsible for the failure of his city to remit almost sixty-three million pesos to the Government Security and Insurance Service or G S I S as payment for previous loans Caloocan availed from the government agency
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#98:1:B>
Malonzo says he and his city accountants were not informed of the procedure of remittances to G S I S
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#99:1:B>
Previous payments to G S I S were automatically deducted from the city 's internal revenue allotment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-009#100:1:B>
A directive in nineteen ninety-seven cancelled this procedure and required the local government units to pay directly to the insurance agency
