<h> <bold> ABSTRACT </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#4:1>
<it> Vegetative thalli of <ul> <foreign> Gracilariopsis bailinae
</foreign> </ul> weighing 10 g each were tied to a 5-m monofilament line with
plastic strips and laid horizontally on the substrate and were observed to
grow at 30 d interval for 9 months.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#5:1>
The monthly growth rate and yield were determined and a cost and
return analysis of the culture system was made.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#6:1>
The monthly growth rate of the seaweed was significantly different (
P=0.05) over culture month.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#7:1>
The highest average growth rate was 6.7% day <sp> - 1 </sp> while the
lowest was 1.7%.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#8:1>
The lowest and highest average yield ( dry wt) was 72 g and 660 g m
<sp> - 2 </sp> mo <sp> - 1 </sp> , respectively. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#9:1>
A capital asset of &peso;1,680, working capital of &peso;2,980,
and annual production cost of &peso;5,860 were calculated from the culture
system.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#10:1>
An annual net return of &peso;31,292 was computed based on a 1,000 m
<sp> 2 </sp> area.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#11:1>
Return on investment is 671.50% while payback period is 1.7 months.

<h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#13:1>
<it> <foreign> Gracilariopsis bailinae </foreign> </it> like
other species of <it> Gracilaria </it> is a potential source of agar (
Hurtado-Ponce and Umezaki, 1988; Luhan, 1992; Hurtado-Ponce, 1992a).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#14:1>
Its production from small-scale farming ( Hurtado-Ponce <it>
<foreign> et al. </foreign> </it> , 1992a), wild stock gathering for
commercial purposes ( Hurtado-Ponce 1992b), and its abundance ( de Castro
<it> <foreign> et al. </foreign> </it> , 1991) in Western Visayas are
motivating factors to further develop the market value of this agarophyte.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#15:1>
Results from experimental studies show that cultivation of <it>
<foreign> Gracilariopsis </foreign> </it> in cages, both monoculture (
Hurtado-Ponce, 1990; Guanzon and de Castro, 1992) and polyculture (
Hurtado-Ponce, 1992b) have been encouraging.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#16:1>
Still, experiments with larger scale cultivation in mudflats,
drainage canals and estuaries are important to determine its economic
feasibility.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#17:1>
The <it> <foreign> Eucheuma </foreign> </it> fixed-bottom long line
technique of Doty ( 1973) has been adopted in the present study because it is
cost effective.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#18:1>
This paper describes the growth rate, yield and economics of
fixed-bottom long line cultivation of <it> <foreign> Gracilariopsis bailinae
</foreign> </it> in an estuary. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#19:1>
<h> <bold> MATERIALS AND METHODS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#20:1>
The study was conducted within a <it> <foreign> Gracilaria
</foreign> </it> farm near an estuary at Leganes, Iloilo.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#21:1>
Vegetative thalli of <it> <foreign> Gracilariopsis bailinae
</foreign> </it> ( = <it> <foreign> Gracilariopsis heteroclada </foreign>
</it> Zhang <it> <foreign> et al. </foreign> </it> Xia), approximately 10 g
each, were tied to a 5-m monofilament line (
#110) with 'tie-tie' at intervals of 10 cm.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#22:1>
Nine cultivation lines arranged in parallel to the current were laid
horizontally at 25 cm apart and tied to mangrove posts driven into the
bottom.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#23:1>
A 30-day growth period was observed for nine months.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#24:1>
Every month, all seaweeds were harvested, washed, cleaned, freed of
epiphytes and finally weighed on a top loading weighing scale.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#25:1>
The original weight of the seedstock was returned with seedlings
coming from a selection of the harvest.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#26:1>
Mean daily growth rate in each one-month culture period was then
calculated according to Rueness and Tananger ( 1984). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#27:1>
Some environmental parameters like water temperature and salinity
were monitored every sampling time using an ordinary Celsius thermometer and
Atago refractometer, respectively, while water samples within the cultivation
area were collected monthly for pH, NH <sb> 3 </sb> - N, NO <sb> 2 </sb> - N
and PO <sb> 4 </sb> P analyses following the methodology described by
Strickland and Parsons ( 1972). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#28:1>
Cost and returns analysis based on 20% moisture content was used
to determine return on investment ( ROI) and payback period.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#29:1>
ROI was computed by dividing annual net income by the investment.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#30:1>
The payback period was computed by dividing the investment by the sum
of the annual income and annual depreciation ( Shang, 1976).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#31:1>
Production costs were seed plants, plastic straw ( tie-tie), mangrove
post, hired labor, and depreciation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#32:1>
Depreciation was computed using the straight line method based on the
estimated useful life of the asset ( Meade, 1989).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#33:1>
Net income was derived by deducting production costs from gross
returns.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#34:1>
Costs and returns are based on a 0.1 ha area and the currency used in
the computations is the Philippine Peso ( &peso;35 = US &dollar;1).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#35:1>
A partial budget for 'rice planting' and fixed-bottom long line was
included to compare the marginal cost, marginal revenue and net benefit.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#36:1>
Marginal revenue was computed as the difference of 'rice planting'
revenue from fixed-bottom line cultivation; marginal cost was computed as the
difference of marginal cost from marginal revenue. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#38:1>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#39:1>
The average monthly specific growth rate ( SGR) ( Fig. 1) of <it>
<foreign> G. bailinae </foreign> </it> expressed as % increase in wet weight
day <sp> - 1 </sp> ranged from 1.7 to 6.7% day <sp> - 1 </sp> while the yield
ranged from 72 to 660 dwt g m <sp> - 2 </sp> and these were significantly
different over time ( culture month) ( P = 0.05).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#40:1>
The lowest SGR was recorded in March while the highest was in
November.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#41:1>
A decreasing yield was recorded for the first two months of culture,
however, an increasing yield was distinct from March reaching its peak in
June which gradually declined in August.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#42:1>
A sudden increase was recorded in September.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#43:1>
Due to successive typhoons in October, the study was terminated on
this month.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#44:1>
No data was recorded for the month of February due to the adverse
effect of pesticide coming from the neighboring ponds. </p> <O>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#45:1>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#47:1>
<it> <foreign> Gracilariopsis bailinae </foreign> </it> when
grown horizontally on lines with 'tie-tie' method varied according to culture
month just like other species of <it> Gracilaria </it> ( Wang <it> <foreign>
et al. </foreign> </it> , 1984, Li <it> <foreign> et al. </foreign> </it> ,
1984, Westermeier <it> <foreign> et al. </foreign> </it> , 1993).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#48:1>
An average monthly growth rate of 4.5% day <sp> - 1 </sp> was
recorded in the present study which is comparable with the results obtained
by Camara Netto ( 1987) on <it> <foreign> Gracilaria </foreign> </it> ( 4%
day <sp> - 1 </sp> ) using the same cultivation technique.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#49:1>
However, when <it> <foreign> G. bailinae </foreign> </it> was grown
vertically at different depth levels below the water surface with juveniles
of sea bass in floating net cages ( Hurtado-Ponce, 1992b), the seaweed
demonstrated a much higher growth rate ( 13.3% day <sp> - 1 </sp> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#50:1>
A similar observation was reported in <it> <foreign> Gracilaria
verrucosa </foreign> </it> by Ren <it> <foreign> et al. </foreign> </it> , (
1984) using floating raft ( 12% day <sp> - 1 </sp> ) and fixed raft ( 10% day
<sp> - 1 </sp> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#51:1>
Better growth of seaweed is usually obtained near the water surface (
Kim and Humm, 1965).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#52:1>
The adoption of a culture technique to suit the prevailing
characteristics of the study site plays a major role in seaweed cultivation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#53:1>
The choice to adopt the fixed-bottom long line cultivation of <it>
<foreign> G. bailinae </foreign> </it> in this study was mainly due to the
water level during the lowest tide.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#54:1>
In the study site, the area was prepared into fishpond-like with dike
elevation of only 30 cm.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#55:1>
This was done to allow approximately 25-30 cm of water to remain
during the lowest tide in order to avoid direct exposure to the sun and total
dessication.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#56:1>
As a result, the seaweeds were exposed to constant change of seawater
brought by daily tidal changes. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#57:1>
<h> <bold> Environmental parameters </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#58:1>
Water temperature ranged from 28 to 32 &degree;C, salinity from
26 to 33, and pH from 7.5 to 8.2.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#59:1>
Lowest water temperature was recorded in January, August and
September ( 28 &degree; C) while the highest in May ( 32&degree; C).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#60:1>
The lowest salinity of 26 coincided with the lowest temperature.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#61:1>
There was little variation in pH, NO <sb> 2 </sb> - N, NH <sb> 3
</sb> - N and PO <sb> 4 </sb> - P readings during the entire cultivation
period.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#62:1>
Highest yield coincided with the lowest NO <sb> 2 </sb> - N, NH <sb>
3 </sb> - N and PO <sb> 4 </sb> - P readings ( Fig. 2). </p> <O>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#65:1>
The experimental farm experienced a lot of grazing especially
during the juvenile stage ( May-June) of siganids and mullets which
contributed to the loss of biomass and low growth rate.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#66:1>
Similar observations were reported in earlier studies ( Doty, 1986,
Nelson and Tsutsui, 1981, and Hurtado-Ponce, 1990).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#67:1>
Associated algae like <it> <foreign> Polydiphonis, Hypnea </foreign>
</it> , <it> <foreign> Rhizoclonium </foreign> </it> , <it> <foreign> Ulva
</foreign> </it> , and <it> <foreign> Enteromorpha </foreign> </it> were
observed to appear during higher temperature ( Shang, 1976; Chiang, 1981).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#68:1>
Manual removal of these algae was done to reduce competition in
space, nutrients, and sunlight with the cultured species.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#69:1>
Highest growth and yield coincided with lower water temperature and
salinity.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#70:1>
pH readings were within the favorable range ( Liu, 1987). </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#71:1>
<h> <bold> Costs and Returns </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#72:1>
Total investments for a 0.1 ha <it> <foreign> Gracilariopsis
</foreign> </it> line farm amounting to &peso;4,660.00 included cash outlays
for capital assets ( &peso;1,680) and working capital ( &peso;2,980.00) for
the first cropping. ( Table 1).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#73:1>
The cost of production for a 0.1 ha <it> <foreign> G. bailinae
</foreign> </it> line farm was &peso;5,860. 00 yr <sp> - 1 </sp> , with 9
crops yr <sp> - 1 </sp> ( Table 2).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#74:1>
At the current farm gate price of &peso;12 kg <sp> - 1 </sp> ( dry),
gross returns crop <sp> - 1 </sp> was &peso; 33,024 ( Table 3).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#75:1>
A net income of &peso; 31,292 yr <sp> - 1 </sp> was computed with an
ROI of 671.5% using the line method.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#76:1>
Initial investment is recovered in almost two ( 2) months.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#77:1>
<it> <foreign> Gracilariopsis bailinae </foreign> </it> planted with
a fixed-bottom long line method compared with 'rice planting' yields a higher
marginal revenue ( &peso;23,112), marginal cost ( &peso;3,522.24) and net
benefit ( &peso;19,589.76) ( Table 4) which simply indicates that the former
method of planting is more productive than 'rice planting' on the same
planting area. </p> <O>

Calculation of yield ( dwt g m <sp> - 2 </sp> ) was based on a
monthly basis to estimate the lowest and highest value.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#92:1>
However, for purposes of computing the cost and returns, average
yield ( 344 dwt g m <sp> - 2 </sp> ) for the 9-month culture was used.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#93:1>
Minimum and maximum yield of 72 g mo <sp> - 1 </sp> ( 6.5 dwt ha <sp>
- 1 </sp> yr <sp> - 1 </sp> ) and 660 g mo <sp> - 1 </sp> ( 59.4 dwt ha <sp>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#94:1>
Results of the present study are higher than those reported in <it>
<foreign> Gracilaria </foreign> </it> by Chiang ( 1981) in ponds ( 16-43 t ha
<sp> - 1 </sp> ) and Liu ( 1986) ( 3.5 t ha <sp> - 1 </sp> ) and in mudflats
using floating rafts ( 2 t ha <sp> - 1 </sp> ) ( Liu, 1987).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#95:1>
Reports on <it> <foreign> Gracilaria </foreign> </it> farming in
Chile using polyethylene tubes filled with sand revealed a production of
550-880 g mo <sp> - 1 </sp> ( Buschmann <it> <foreign> et al. </foreign>
</it> , 1992).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#96:1>
A much higher production of <it> <foreign> Gracilaria </foreign>
</it> in tanks was reported by Hanisak 1981 and Ryther <it> <foreign> et al.
</foreign> </it> , 1979 ( 127 t ha <sp> - 1 </sp> yr <sp> - 1 </sp> ) and
Ugarte and Santelices, 1992 ( 41 t ha <sp> - 1 </sp> year <sp> - 1 </sp>
dry).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#97:1>
These data indicate the potential of <it> <foreign> Gracilaria
</foreign> </it> for sustained production in a commercial cultivation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#98:1>
Though an attempt to culture <it> <foreign> Gracilaria </foreign>
</it> species on long lines was made in discharge canal of shrimp ponds in
Thailand ( Chandrkrachang, 1992), there were no reports on growth rate, yield
and economic feasibility.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-026#99:1>
Results of the study suggest that fixed-bottom long line method of
cultivating <it> <foreign> G. bailinae </foreign> </it> in an estuary is
feasible and possibly also in tidal mud flats. </p>
