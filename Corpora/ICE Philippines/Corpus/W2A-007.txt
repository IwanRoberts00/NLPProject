<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#3:1>
<it> The author analyzes albeit philosophically three basic terms
which have become controversial in Philippine revolutionary historiography
today.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#4:1>
These terms are <mention> &ldquo; Philippine &rdquo; </mention> ,
<mention> &ldquo; revolution &rdquo; </mention> , and <mention> &ldquo;
Philippine Revolution &rdquo; </mention> . </it> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#5:1>
<h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#6:1>
In ordinary parlance, any analysis in philosophy is philosophical
analysis.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#7:1>
In contemporary philosophy, however, philosophical analysis is a
technical methodology - - an offshoot of the Anglo-American analytic
tradition in philosophy.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#8:1>
It is a combination of logical analysis as developed by Bertrand
Russell ( 1972: 828-836) and the logical positivists, especially Rudolf
Carnap ( 1955:209-25), among others, and linguistic analysis as developed by
G.E. Moore ( White 1955:20) and Ludwig Wittgenstein ( 1989: 31-36) in his
<mention> Philosophical Investigations </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#9:1>
John Searle ( 1972:1) calls this analytic methodology <mention>
linguistic philosophy </mention> , and he uses it to analyze the meanings and
the deep logical structures of general features of language.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#10:1>
The aim of philosophical analysis is to clarify the meanings of
concepts of whatever field of study and their theoretical underpinnings.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#11:1>
It is the broad method of conceptual analysis where the analyst can
himself modify or reformulate the theories behind the concept. <sp> 1 </sp>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#12:1>
In this paper, I will do a philosophical analysis of the term
<mention> &ldquo; Philippine revolution. &rdquo; </mention> <fnr> <sp> 2
</sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#13:1>
There are three basic concepts to be analysed here.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#14:1>
The first is the term <mention> &ldquo; Philippine. &rdquo;
</mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#15:1>
It is important to understand the evolution of this concept in the
light of attempts by some sectors of Philippine society to change the name of
the Philippines to <mention> &ldquo; Rizal &rdquo; </mention> or <mention>
&ldquo; <indig> Maharlika </indig> , &rdquo; </mention> etc.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#16:1>
Towards the end of my analysis of this term, I will discuss the first
attempts to replace it.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#17:1>
Andres Bonifacio ( 1963: 68-69) and Emilio Jacinto ( 1935: 60) wanted
to call the Philippine nation as <mention> &ldquo; <indig> Katagalugan
</indig> . &rdquo; </mention> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#18:1>
The second concept is the term <mention> &ldquo; revolution.
&rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#19:1>
It is significant to analyse this concept in the light of the
continuing debate as to whether Rizal was simply a reformist or truly a
revolutionist.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#20:1>
What is the difference, for example, between a &ldquo; reform &rdquo;
and a &ldquo; peaceful revolution"?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#21:1>
Why is a &ldquo; peaceful revolution &rdquo; called a revolution?
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#22:1>
The third concept is the term <mention> &ldquo; Philippine
revolution. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#23:1>
Is it a revolution from above ( the Great Tradition), from below (
the Little Tradition), or in between ( the Middle Tradition)?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#24:1>
What is the criterion of classification?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#25:1>
Is it simply the bulk of participants - - the dominant participant
class - - in the revolution, or is it the group that initiated or originated
the revolution?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#26:1>
What are some significant differences between the Philippine
Revolution, the American Revolution, and the French Revolution?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#27:1>
It is probably fruitful to contrast these three revolutions, which
belong to the same genre - - i.e., democratic in inclination - - and see some
of their essential differences. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#28:1>
<h> <bold> ON THE CONCEPT <mention> &ldquo; PHILIPPINE &rdquo;
</mention> </bold> </h> <h> <bold> On <mention> &ldquo; Philippine &rdquo;
</mention> and <mention> &ldquo; Filipinos &rdquo; </mention> </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#29:1>
From our history we know that the term <mention> Philippine
</mention> is derived from the name of the prince of Asturias, <mention>
Philip II </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#30:1>
In Spanish he is <foreign> Principe Felipe II ( Segundo) </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#31:1>
In the Spanish tradition, the prince of Asturias is the heir apparent
of the king of Spain in the same manner that the prince of Wales is the heir
apparent of the king of Great Britain.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#32:1>
When Ruy Lopez de Villalobos named the island of Tandaya ( now Samar)
in 1543 as <mention> &ldquo; Felipina &rdquo; </mention> in honor of the
prince of Asturias, he knew that Principe Felipe II would be the next king of
Spain. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#33:1>
It was Miguel Lopez de Legaspi who called the entire archipelago
as <mention> &ldquo; Felipinas &rdquo; </mention> in 1565 ( later it became
&ldquo; Philipinas &rdquo; or &ldquo; Filipinas").

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#34:1>
By this time Philip II was already the king of Spain since his
father, Carlos I, decided to retire in 1556.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#35:1>
It was Philip II who ordered the expedition to colonize the
Philippines from Mexico.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#36:1>
When Andres de Urdaneta refused to head the expedition, saying that
it violated the Treaty of Zaragosa of 1529 since the archipelago lay within
the demarcation line of Portugal, Philip II replaced him with Legaspi with
the express instruction to colonize the archipelago. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#37:1>
During the early part of Spanish colonization, Pedro Chirino in
1604, Juan Francisco de San Antonio in 1738, and Francisco Antolin in 1739,
called the natives of the archipelago as <mention> &ldquo; Philipinos &rdquo;
</mention> or <mention> &ldquo; Filipinos &rdquo; </mention> ( Scott 1994:
6).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#38:1>
Originally, the term <mention> &ldquo; <foreign> indios </foreign>
&ldquo; </mention> simply meant inhabitants of West Indies ( Agoncillo 1981:
83).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#39:1>
Later on, however, the Spaniards used this term pejoratively - - to
connote inferiority, indolence, stupidity, fit only to be servants, and the
like. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#40:1>
In the nineteenth century, the <foreign> insulares </foreign> or
Creoles, or Spaniards born in the Philippines, regarded themselves as equal
to the <foreign> peninsulares </foreign> or Spaniards born in Spain.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#41:1>
But the <foreign> peninsulares </foreign> , who considered themselves
as the true Spaniards, or the true natives of Spain, looked down upon the
<foreign> insulares </foreign> and called them <mention> Filipinos </mention>
, or natives of the Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#42:1>
During the <mention> Propaganda Movement </mention> the term
<mention> &ldquo; Filipino &rdquo; </mention> was used to include not only
<foreign> insulares </foreign> but also the urbanized and educated <foreign>
indios </foreign> like Jose Rizal, Graciano Lopez Jaena, Marcelo H. del Pilar
<foreign> et al. </foreign> , and the Spanish and Chinese <foreign> mestizos
</foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#43:1>
But the common man remained to be called an <mention> <foreign> indio
</foreign> </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#44:1>
Leon Ma. Guerrero ( 1974: 1-549) considered Rizal as the first
Filipino because the latter was the first to think in terms of the
Philippines as a nation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#45:1>
During the Philippine Revolution, Emilio Aguinaldo called all the
natives of the Philippines as Filipinos when he issued his first manifesto on
31 October 1896.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#46:1>
Later on, in 1898, Governor General Basilio Agustin called the
<foreign> indios </foreign> as Filipinos themselves when he solicited their
help against the American forces which were preparing to attack Intramuros (
Gripaldo 1994: 114).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#47:1>
In describing the entire archipelago, the Spaniards and Filipinos
called it <mention> <foreign> &ldquo; Islas Filipinas &rdquo; </foreign>
</mention> or simply <mention> &ldquo; Filipinas &rdquo; </mention> while the
Americans called it the <mention> &ldquo; Philippine Islands &rdquo;
</mention> or simply the <mention> &ldquo; Philippines. &rdquo; </mention>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#48:1>
The term <mention> Filipino </mention> , however, was limited
only to Christianized natives.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#49:1>
The pagan and <indig> Moro </indig> tribes refused to be called
<mention> Filipinos </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#50:1>
The Moros in particular viewed the Filipinos as Christians and they
would not want to be called Filipinos because they would not want to become
Christians.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#51:1>
<indig> Moro </indig> nationalism probably began during the time of
Laut Buisan ( Majul 1973: 118; De los Santos 1988: 101-102), the sultan of
Maguindanao, who held a meeting in 1603 with several <indig> datus </indig>
of Leyte at Dulag so that the Leyte <indig> datus </indig> and the
Maguindanaos can unite to fight against the Spaniards.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#52:1>
This was short-lived, however.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#53:1>
His son, <foreign> Sultan </foreign> Kudarat, also desired unity in
1628 against the invaders. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#54:1>
Emilio Aguinaldo saw the problem of politically integrating the
<indig> Moros </indig> into the national body politic.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#55:1>
An appeal of &ldquo; unity &rdquo; was communicated to the <indig>
Moro </indig> leaders ( Agoncillo 1981 271; Majul 1973: 315) to work hand in
hand with the revolutionists and fight the Americans.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#56:1>
The immediate solution of politically integrating the pagan and
<indig> Moro </indig> tribes would be to make a transition from the
historical meaning of the term <mention> &ldquo; Filipino &rdquo; </mention>
to the political or constitutional definition of that term.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#57:1>
The Filipino leaders provided such a definition in the Malolos
Constitution ( Title IV, Art. 6) where anyone was a Filipino if ( 1) he is
born in Philippine territory, including a vessel flying the Philippine flag;
( 2) he is a child of a Filipino father or mother, although born outside the
Philippines; ( 3) he as a foreigner is a naturalized Filipino; and ( 4) he as
a foreigner has acquired residence in any town of the Philippines and paid
taxes for two years without interruption.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#58:1>
Aguinaldo officially communicated his approval of the Malolos
Constitution on 21 January 1899 ( Agoncillo 1960: 761). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#59:1>
During the American period, the <indig> Moros </indig> wanted a
separate independence from the Filipinos.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#60:1>
The American administration in the Philippines decided to unite the
entire archipelago and introduce education in Moroland, but most of the
<indig> Moros </indig> did not allow their children to enrol for fear of
being educated and then made Filipinos or Christians ( Elequin 1981-82: 83;
Gowing 1981-82: 21-22).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#61:1>
For the Americans, it was important to educate the pagan and <indig>
Moro </indig> tribes so that they could easily be integrated into the
national mainstream of political consciousness. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#62:1>
The Filipino leaders continued the Malolos tradition and in 1935
produced a constitution which defined the Filipino as a person ( 1) who is a
Filipino citizen at the time of the adoption of the 1935 Constitution; ( 2)
who was born in the Philippines of foreign parents but who had been formerly
elected to public office; ( 3) whose father is a Filipino citizen; ( 4) whose
mother is a Filipino citizen and who elects Filipino citizenship upon
reaching the age of majority; and ( 5) who becomes a Filipino citizen by
naturalization. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#63:1>
After independence a committee of three Muslim leaders <fnr> <sp>
3 </sp> </fnr> ( Saber 1979:55) identified the <indig> Moro </indig> Problem
as a problem of integration into the national body politic through education.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#64:1>
Former Senator Domocao Alonto thereby authored a law creating the
Mindanao State University with the primary purpose of politically integrating
the pagan and <indig> Moro </indig> tribes into the mainstream of national
consciousness.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#65:1>
The integration process will be political assimilation so that the
non-Christian tribes will accept themselves as Filipinos and also cultural
acculturation so that they will eclectically internalize nonharmful cultural
values from other tribes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#66:1>
At present there are still a resistance to the term Filipino from the
<indig> Moro </indig> National Liberation Front ( MNLF), Moro Islamic
Liberation Front ( MILF), and others <fnr> <sp> 4 </sp> </fnr> who would
rather want to establish an independent <indig> Bangsa Moro </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#67:1>
Very recently Nur Misuari of the MNLF agreed with the Philippine
government to run as governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao and
at the same time to be the chairman of the Southern Philippines Council for
Peace and Development. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#68:1>
<h> <bold> On &ldquo; <mention> Katagalugan </mention> &ldquo; and
&ldquo; <mention> Tagalogs </mention> &ldquo; </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#69:1>
At this juncture, let me turn the discussion on <mention>
Katagalugan </mention> as the first attempt to change the name of Filipinas
and of the term <mention> &ldquo; Tagalog &rdquo; </mention> to replace the
term <mention> &ldquo; Filipino. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#70:1>
The basis of this interpretation is Bonifacio 's manifesto, <indig>
&ldquo; Ang Dapat Mabatid ng mga Tagalog, &rdquo; </indig> which appeared in
the first issue of the Katipunan newspaper <it> <indig> Kalayaan </indig>
</it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#71:1>
The date and place of publication of the first issue was January 1896
at Yokohama, Japan to mislead the Spanish authorities but it actually came
out in mid-March 1896 and was printed in Manila. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#72:1>
Historians like Teodoro Agoncillo and Isagani Medina <fnr> <sp> 5
</sp> </fnr> believed that Bonifacio 's manifesto already addressed the
entire archipelago when he used the terms <mention> &ldquo; Tagalog &rdquo;
</mention> and <mention> &ldquo; Katagalugan. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#73:1>
Agoncillo ( 1963: 2-3) specifically translated Bonifacio 's manifesto
as <mention> &ldquo; What the Filipinos Should Know. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#74:1>
The only justification for this interpretation was a footnote in one
of the works of Emilio Jacinto, <indig> &ldquo; Katipunan ng mga A. N. B.
&rdquo; </indig> and subtitled <indig> &ldquo; Sa May Nasang Makisanib sa
Katipunang Ito. &rdquo; </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#75:1>
The footnote ( Jacinto 1935:60; see Guerrero, Encarnacion, and
Villegas 1996: 5-6; Reyes 1996: 22) reads: <X> <quote> <indig> Sa salitang
tagalog katutura'y ang lahat ng tumubo sa Sangkapuluang ito, sa makatuid,
bisaya man, iloko man, kapangpangan man, etc. ay tagalog din. </indig>
</quote> </X> ( <quote> The word Tagalog refers to all natives of the
archipelago; in other words, Bisayans, Ilokanos, Pampangue&ntilde;os, etc.
are all Tagalogs </quote> .)

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#76:1>
It is important to ascertain when the article was actually written.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#77:1>
Agoncillo did not provide any categorical answer.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#78:1>
He simply assumed that the article, or even the idea of Katagalugan,
in the context of his writings, came very much earlier than the appearance of
Bonifacio 's manifesto in <indig> Kalayaan </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#79:1>
So far, there is no documentary evidence on this. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#80:1>
The <indig> Katipunan </indig> was established on 7 July 1892 and
Jacinto became a member in 1893 when he was eighteen years old.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#81:1>
It took time before he became a fluent speaker of Tagalog since he
spoke fluently what was known as <indig> &ldquo; Kastilang tindahan &rdquo;
</indig> ( Santos 1935: 13). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#82:1>
We have no evidence that Jacinto wrote the article, <indig>
&ldquo; Katipunan ng mga A(nak) N(g) B(ayan) &rdquo; </indig> ( the Katipunan
<foreign> kartilya </foreign> ) prior to March 1896, the appearance of the
newspaper <it> <indig> Kalayaan </indig> </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#83:1>
In all likelihood, he wrote it after the publication of Bonifacio 's
manifesto in <it> <indig> Kalayaan </indig> </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#84:1>
John R. M. Taylor ( 1971, I: 215-16), who published the five-volume
work on the Philippine insurgent records entitled <mention> &ldquo; The
Philippine Insurrection Against the United States, &rdquo; </mention> said
that Jacinto 's article was written in 1896.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#85:1>
Guerrero <foreign> et al. </foreign> ( 1996: 5) confirmed this by
saying that the <indig> Katipunan </indig> <foreign> Cartilla </foreign> was
&ldquo; Written and published in 1896... &rdquo;

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#86:1>
Since that article was not published in the first issue of <it>
<indig> Kalayaan </indig> </it> , it must probably be written after the
publication of the first issue.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#87:1>
What is interesting in Taylor 's English translation of Jacinto 's
article is that there was no mention of <mention> &ldquo; Tagalog &rdquo;
</mention> and definitely there was no footnote explaining the use of the
term <mention> Tagalog </mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#88:1>
Assuming that this footnote was not an addition and was
originally there in the Tagalog article, and assuming that Taylor himself
simply omitted the word <mention> Tagalog </mention> and the footnote, and
replaced them with the phrase <mention> &ldquo; all Filipinos &rdquo;
</mention> ( 1971: 216), there is still a need to find a justification why
Jacinto made it a point to explain the term <mention> Tagalog </mention> to
mean natives of the entire archipelago in a footnote. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#89:1>
The theory I forwarded in two articles, <mention> &ldquo;
Bonifacio the translator: a critique, &rdquo; </mention> which appeared in
<it> <indig> Kinaadman </indig> </it> in 1987 ( 42-56) and <indig> &ldquo;
Pagbabalik-tanaw sa pilosopiya ng rebolusyon ni Andres Bonifacio, &rdquo;
</indig> which was published in the book <it> <indig> Katipunan: Isang
pambansang kilusan </indig> </it> , edited by Ferdinand Llanes ( 1994:105-15;
see also Gripaldo 1995:51-52) of the University of the Philippines, is that
Bonifacio wrote his manifesto only for the Tagalog tribe because he wanted to
have a core of revolutionists.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#90:1>
Jacinto later on was compelled to extend the meaning of the term
<mention> Tagalog </mention> to include all natives of the archipelago
because of the surge of applicants for membership to the <indig> Katipunan
</indig> society from all types of tribes after the distribution of <it>
<indig> Kalayaan </indig> </it> , which contained the philosophies of
revolution of Bonifacio and Jacinto. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#91:1>
Notice that from 7 July 1892 to mid-March 1896, the appearance of
the first issue of <it> <indig> Kalayaan </indig> </it> , or three years and
nine months after the establishment of the <indig> Katipunan </indig> , there
were only approximately 300 <indig> Katipunan </indig> members.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#92:1>
If Bonifacio wanted to refer by <mention> &ldquo; Tagalog &rdquo;
</mention> and <mention> &ldquo; Katagalugan &rdquo; </mention> to &ldquo;
the natives of all Philippine tribes &rdquo; and to the whole archipelago,
respectively, he should have already made this explanation in his manifesto
because ( 1) of the significance of its content ( it was actually his
philosophy of revolution) and ( 2) he knew beforehand that there were members
of the <indig> Katipunan </indig> who were non-Tagalogs like Valentin Diaz,
an Ilokano, and Candido Iban and Francisco del Castillo, both Bisayans, among
others.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#93:1>
He must have therefore limited his manifesto to the Tagalog tribe.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#94:1>
From mid-March 1896 to 19 August 1896 when the <indig> Katipunan
</indig> was discovered, a matter of five months, the membership jumped to
about 30,000.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#95:1>
Later estimates make it even up to 400,000 <indig> Katipunan </indig>
members ( Guerrero et al. 1996:4).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#96:1>
In all probability, non-Tagalog migrants who lived in Tondo and
nearby places ( see note 6 below), who had read <it> <indig> Kalayaan
</indig> </it> , decided to join the <indig> Katipunan </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-007#97:1>
Jacinto was therefore constrained to expand the meaning of the term
<mention> Tagalog </mention> when he wrote the <indig> &ldquo; Katipunan ng
mga A. N. B., &rdquo; </indig> which was intended for those who may want to
join the secret revolutionary society. </p> </I>
