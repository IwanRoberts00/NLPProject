<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#3:1>
<it> Textile waste cuttings mixed with cement as binder produce a
unique kind of composite material that looks like concrete but can be cut or
nailed like wood.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#4:1>
It exhibits certain physical and mechanical properties indicating its
potential for low-cost lightweight construction. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#5:1>
The result of the laboratory tests indicate a sturdy
lighter-than-concrete building material with various potential uses--for
ceilings, walls, wooden board substitute, or as an economical alternative
concrete block. </it> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#6:1>
The research conducted shows that textile waste cuttings when
mixed with cement as binder produces a unique kind of composite material that
can be used for low-cost lightweight construction.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#7:1>
The composite material looks very much like an ordinary &ldquo;
concrete product &rdquo; but weighs like an ordinary lumber. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#8:1>
The research is timely and relevant for statistics show that the
disposal of textile waste cuttings will soon become a major problem.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#9:1>
The textile cuttings are usually disposed of as waste product which
become an environmental nuisance because of its non-biodegradability, or
burned in heaps thus releasing highly toxic fumes in the surrounding air.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#10:1>
Due to the influx of these voluminous wastes in our environment, we
ought to find ways of turning it into useful materials.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#11:1>
This study explores the possible ways to warrant the production of
new products from waste materials - - textile cuttings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#12:1>
This focuses on the technical aspect of making test samples and
the determination of textile-cement material 's specific weight, water and
moisture absorptions, compressive, tensile and flexural strengths. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#13:1>
An economic feasibility study of the said research is of much
importance as the technical aspect.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#14:1>
An in-place cost comparison of textile-cement material and commonly
used plyboards and lumber for ceiling and partitions supply the needed data
for its market feasibility analysis. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#15:1>
Its physical and mechanical properties indicate its potential as
a substitute material for some concrete products yet lighter and more
economical than concrete, as substitute for wooden board yet sturdier and
more fire resistant than wood. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#16:1>
<h> <bold> MATERIAL COMPONENTS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#17:1>
The composite material is produced from a mixture of textile
waste cuttings, portland cement and water.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#18:1>
In the study, the textile waste cuttings are taken from a shirt
manufacturing firm and from a garment factory.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#19:1>
The textile consists of cotton, polyester, silk and rayon.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#20:1>
A homogenous single type of textile usually consists of a combination
of these materials in various percentages. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#21:1>
Portland cement mixed with water is used as binder.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#22:1>
As in all concrete materials using hydraulic cement, the cement paste
or binder is actually the result of a chemical reaction between cement and
water.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#23:1>
The said chemical reaction, characterized by hydration, continues
even for many days until the binding medium plus any embedded particles in it
is said to have sufficiently hardened, usually for a period of 28 days. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#24:1>
In the textile-cement composite material under study the textile
cuttings may not be conceived as either an aggregate or reinforcement.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#25:1>
However, they contribute to the increase in volume of the mixture (
which is the major function of an aggregate) less the weight, and contribute
to the increase in the tensile resistance ( which is the major function of
the reinforcement) due to its fibrous nature. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#26:1>
<h> <bold> FABRICATION OF SAMPLES </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#27:1>
The textile waste cuttings are trimmed into average lengths of 2
cm. and 6 cm., and mixed with portland cement in textile-cement ratios of
1:3, 1:4 and 1:5 by weight.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#28:1>
Water is added in amounts corresponding to water-cement ratios
ranging from 0.53 to 0.85. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#29:1>
Experimental blocks with dimensions of 2.5 cm. x 9.5 cm. x 14.5
cm. are fabricated and tested for tension and flexure, while cubes of 5 cm. x
5 cm. are used for compression tests. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#30:1>
The different steps in fabrication are shown in Figure 1. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#31:1>
<h> <bold> LABORATORY TESTS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#32:1>
The 54 samples tested represent the 18 design mixes, that is, 3
replicates per design mix.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#33:1>
The number of design mixes resulted from varying the quantities of
the 3 material components: textile, cement and water.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#34:1>
The variations were expressed in terms of fiber-cement ratio by
weight, water-cement ratio by weight and textile length.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#35:1>
Two textile lengths were used: 2 cm. ( designated as S for short
fibers) and 6 cm. ( designated as L for long fibers).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#36:1>
The mix combinations are shown in Figure 2. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#37:1>
The samples were evaluated for unit weight, water and moisture
absorption, biodegradability, flammability, compressive, tensile and flexural
strengths.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#38:1>
In the study, evaluation on biodegradability was done, not by
laboratory test, but by analyzing the chemical composition and properties of
the fiber based on data obtained from the Department of Science and
Technology and from the Philippine Textile Research Institute.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#39:1>
Tests on flammability consisted of subjecting the samples to open
flame from a gas stove for a period of 30 minutes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#40:1>
Physical tests for the determination of its density, water and
moisture absorption were conducted at <indig> Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng
Maynila </indig> <&> trans., University of the City of Manila </&> -
Engineering Laboratory.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#41:1>
An oven was used to determine the oven-dry weights of the samples.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#42:1>
Mechanical tests to find the flexural, tensile and compressive
strengths of the samples were done using the Universal Testing Machine ( UTM)
of the Construction Manpower Development Foundation ( CMDF) at Bo. <&>
abbreviation for <foreign> Barrio </foreign> </&> Salawag, Dasmari&ntilde;as,
Cavite.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#43:1>
The UTM used has a 50 ton-force capacity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#44:1>
The above mentioned tests are in accordance with the ASTM
standards for testing materials. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#45:1>
<h> <bold> TEST RESULTS </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#46:1>
Laboratory results from tests conducted, are presented in Table 1
and 2.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#47:1>
Results show that the textile-cement materials behaved differently
for every controlled variable.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#48:1>
Nevertheless, these data have been analyzed for their possible
variances.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#49:1>
This is to determine the accuracy of the experiment through the
results obtained. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#50:1>
The reliability of the experiment was evaluated using analysis of
variance ( ANOVA) and regression analysis as the curve fitting tool to show
the trend of effects of different controlled variables using Table A shown.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#51:1>
In general the reliability of the experimental data can be
accepted at 99% confidence interval being it not random samples of a bigger
sample size.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#52:1>
The relation between the dependent and independent variables is given
by the correlation coefficients which register greater than 90% showing a
very good relation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#53:1>
The relatively high values of correlation coefficient indicate that a
linear regression analysis can be used as a tool in projecting values of Y
for certain values of X. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#54:1>
A tabular summary of the findings is shown to clearly present the
effects of the different variables to the physical and mechanical properties
of the textile-cement material.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#55:1>
This presents the possible trends of effects these variables give on
the properties of textile-cement material. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#56:1>
Water-cement ratio varies inversely with the specific weight,
compressive, tensile and flexural strengths of the material.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#57:1>
Also it varies proportionately with the water and moisture
absorption. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#58:1>
Cement-fiber ratio varies proportionately with the specific
weight, compressive, tensile and flexural strengths.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#59:1>
Furthermore, it varies inversely with the water and moisture
absorption of the material. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#60:1>
The size of the textile fiber affects the properties of the
material.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#61:1>
Long fibers produce better results than that of the short fibers.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#62:1>
Upon evaluation of the chemical compositions of the fibers used,
the material shows a high degree of non-biodegradability and after being
subjected to direct open fire, shows zero flammability making it a good
fire-resisting material. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#63:1>
From the standpoint of economics, an in-place analysis of the
different material and specification combination for ceiling and partitions
shows that a savings ranging from 59.81 to 97.97 pesos per square meter and
172.63 and 253.48 pesos for ceiling and partitions, respectively, can be
obtained utilizing the TCM as substitute material for plywood, as shown in
Tables 6 and 7.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#64:1>
TCM at different fiber-cement ratios combined with ordinary 50 cm. by
50 cm. ceiling joists and wall studs at various spacing is compared with an
ordinary plyboard ceiling and walling.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#65:1>
Savings are derived mainly from the substitution of TCM for plywood.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#66:1>
Differences in the in-place cost of the two materials at various
combinations show big savings if TCM is used. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#67:1>
This clearly indicates that TCM is a money saving material for
the construction industry. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#68:1>
<h> <bold> CONCLUSION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#69:1>
The textile cuttings, when mixed with hydraulic cement as binder,
produce a composite material that can be used for low-cost lightweight
construction. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#70:1>
The composite material has physical and mechanical properties
that make it a potential substitute for some concrete products as well as a
substitute for wooden boards. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#71:1>
Consequently, the use of textile waste cuttings in construction
may solve two problems, namely, elimination of an environmental pollutant and
provision of an alternative material for the construction industry. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#72:1>
<h> <bold> RECOMMENDATION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#73:1>
It is therefore recommended that the use of textile-cement
material be encouraged to provide people with new class of construction
material of comparable strengths and other potential properties as
lightweightness, non-biodegradability and fire-resistant. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Production Line Balancing ( Or Why 1 + 1 Is Not Equal to 2
or 3) </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#75:2>
<bold> Rumel V. Atienza </bold>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#76:2>
<h> <it> > Abstract </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#77:2>
LINE BALANCING is among the basic concepts in production and
operations management which are often misunderstood.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#78:2>
This article explains, through the use of simulation, why bottleneck,
idle capacity, and delay occur due to production line imbalance. </it> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#79:2>
With the advent of the synergy concept, the expression 1 + 1 is
no longer solely equal to the mathematically correct answer of 2, but is also
equal to 3.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#80:2>
Management scientists and behavioral psychologists believe and have
proven that the concerted effort of two human beings can result in an output
much greater than the combined outputs of the two working separately. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#81:2>
But the idea that 1 + 1 is not equal to 2 has for long been
common knowledge among production managers and engineers, only this time, the
answer is not equal to 3; instead it is equal to less than 1. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#82:2>
To illustrate: consider a continuous production line composed of
eight sewing operators ( sewers) producing pants.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#83:2>
If it takes 20 minutes to produce one pair of pants, how many pants
can be produced by the production line in an eight-hour working day?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#84:2>
Supposedly, the answer is 192 pairs ( = 8 hr/man-day x 60 min/hr x 8
man/day / 20 min/pair).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#85:2>
In a majority of cases, however, the production line produces much
less than 192 per day, even if men and machines are efficient.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#86:2>
This happens because the production line is imbalanced. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#87:2>
In almost all production set-ups, whether continuous, batch or
job shop, products are processed through work sections, each section
producing or attaching one component of the product rather than each section
producing one complete unit of the product.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#88:2>
Balance in the production line refers to the equality of the rates of
output ( called capacity) of the work sections.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#89:2>
When imbalance exists, the maximum capacity for the whole line is
equal to the capacity of the slowest section, termed as the <mention> &ldquo;
bottleneck &rdquo; operation </mention> , and idle capacity exists in all
other sections, except in the bottleneck. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#90:2>
<h> <bold> A Simulation of the Production Process </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#91:2>
To better appreciate the meaning of line balance, capacity and
bottleneck, let us take a look at this simulation of a simple production
system.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#92:2>
This production process is composed of six activities, namely: A, B,
C, D, E and F.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#93:2>
Activity A has to be performed before B, C, or D can be performed,
i.e., A is a precedent of B, C, and D.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#94:2>
Similarly, activity E cannot be performed until B, C and D are
completed.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#95:2>
Activity F, on the other hand, must be preceded by E.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#96:2>
Table 1 shows this necessary precedence between activities and the
time required to finish each activity.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#97:2>
Figure 1 shows the precedence chart of this production system. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#98:2>
Suppose that each activity is assigned to one section composed of
one man ( or man-and-machine).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#99:2>
We will simulate the production process to determine the following
parameters:

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#100:2>
a. Time it takes to finish one unit of output with minimum delay

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#101:2>
b. Capacity or the output per given time of this line

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#102:2>
c. Idle capacity available </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#103:2>
With a simulation interval of 10 seconds, let us take a look at
the first stage of the simulation, corresponding to the first 200 seconds (
see Table 2). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#104:2>
It can be observed from this simulation that unit 1 has been
completed without any delay ( start at t = 0 and end at t = 180).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#105:2>
Unit 2, however, incurred a 10 sec. delay after t = 140 since all
sections were loaded with work.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#106:2>
Completion time is expected to be equal to 190 seconds.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#107:2>
Unit 3 incurred a delay of 50 seconds, thus expected completion time
is at least 230 ( =180+50) seconds. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#108:2>
Observe that from the 90th second upward, section A was idle.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#109:2>
Activities were temporarily stopped in A since the other sections
were still loaded.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#110:2>
Section A can afford to be idle.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#111:2>
This move is logical, especially if the product or raw materials are
perishable, or if management wishes to minimize work-in-process inventory, or
minimize processing time in the production line, among other reasons.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#112:2>
For simulation purposes, we impose this policy to be more realistic
about the average earliest completion time of one unit of output.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#113:2>
This &ldquo; constraint, &rdquo; however, can be removed if we are
not at all interested in measuring parameter ( a). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#114:2>
Since the first stage of any simulation process may not be
indicative of the actual trends of the production parameters we want to
measure, let us continue with the simulation until 1000 seconds.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#115:2>
( Please see Table 3 and Table 3a for the simulations).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#116:2>
Table 3 simulation will be used to measure the capacity, bottleneck
and idle capacity.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#117:2>
Table 3a will be used to determine the time for a unit to be
completed with minimum delay.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#118:2>
From these tables we can conclude the following about the parameters
we want to measure:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#119:2>
a. <h> <it> Completion time of each unit </it> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#120:2>
Longer simulation will result in average completion time approaching
the limit equal to 180 seconds ( as can be observed from the later units
produced).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#121:2>
This 180 seconds is merely the sum total of the time of all the
activities ( 20 + 60 + 40 + 30 + 20 + 10) combined.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#122:2>
Thus, if one worker does all the activities, he can complete one
unit in 180 seconds or three ( 3) minutes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#123:2>
This is equivalent to 20 units per hour or 160 units per day.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#124:2>
In this example, with 6 workers, 6 x 160 = 960 units can be
completed in one day. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#125:2>
b. <h> <it> Capacity of the line </it> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#126:2>
The simulated capacity of this line is 16 units for the first 1000
seconds, equal to 63 seconds/unit.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#127:2>
Longer simulation will approach the limit of 60 seconds per unit.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#128:2>
This is nothing but the capacity of the slowest section, which is B,
the &ldquo; bottleneck &rdquo; operation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#129:2>
This capacity can also be interpreted as 1 unit per minute or 60
units per hour.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#130:2>
With eight hours a day, the whole line of 6 workers can complete 480
units per day.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#131:2>
This is half of what can be done if they worked separately! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#132:2>
c. <h> <it> Idle capacity </it> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#133:2>
It is expected that the idle time for each of the activities is as
follows: <O> table </O>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-031#134:2>
Thus, in a day, 1440 minutes ( equivalent to 3 workers) are
unproductive! </p> </I>
