<h> <bold> An auspicious beginning for the National Museum Complex
</bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#3:1>
LIKE a dream come true, the much-longed-for home for our National
Museum has begun to see the light of day.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#4:1>
First in a complex of three buildings, the National Museum Complex (
the newly renovated Finance building) has opened its doors to the Philippine
public. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#5:1>
On June 11, eve of the Philippine Centennial, a select group
composed of sponsors, donors and benefactors previewed the transformation,
although work on the interiors were not yet quite completed.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#6:1>
Nodding their collective heads in approval, guests and museum
officials inspected the ongoing renovations as well as an exhibit of
artifacts from a shipwreck.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#7:1>
Also interesting was a well-stocked museum shop. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#8:1>
What was once a familiar if somewhat shabby-looking American
period building on Agrifina Circle had suddenly acquired a spanking new look.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#9:1>
Basically, it is the same edifice, classic architecture and all.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#10:1>
But the renovations, mostly done on the interiors, have made it a
fitting shelter for our national treasures, at least.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#11:1>
This building has been renamed <mention> National Museum of the
Filipino People </mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#12:1>
The Corinthian columns are still there, adding to the old world
ambiance this familiar landmark has acquired if only because it has been
around for at least half a century.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#13:1>
Black iron grills with curlicues in simulated balconies mark the
regularly spaced windows on the upper floors, softening somewhat the
American-style architecture of the 1930s. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#14:1>
A five-floor trapezoid encloses a garden which can be viewed from
all sides.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#15:1>
At front and center stands the <mention> Marble Hall </mention> ,
earmarked to be the site of exhibit openings and a venue for formal functions
and state dinners.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#16:1>
It is appropriately dignified with its polished marble walls and
exceptionally high ceiling. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#17:1>
<h> <bold> San Diego exhibit </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#18:1>
Since its opening in June, a visibly impressed public have been
coming to view the imposing structure and its new interiors as well as two
ongoing exhibitions.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#19:1>
Despite the presence of busy workmen who go about their unfinished
tasks, schoolchildren have discovered, at last, what a museum should look
like. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#20:1>
Two second-floor exhibition rooms currently house the <mention>
&ldquo; Homecoming Exhibit of the San Diego &rdquo; </mention> sent back to
the Philippines in coordination with sponsoring French institutions after
successful runs in Paris ( 1994), Madrid ( 1995), New York ( 1996) and Berlin
( 1997). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#21:1>
The San Diego exhibit was a 1600 A.D. ship believed to have been
built in Cebu in 1590 by Basque, Chinese and Filipino craftsmen out of Asian
woods.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#22:1>
Measuring not more than 40 meters in length and 12 meters in width
with a height of 8 meters, it had been used as a trading vessel over the
years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#23:1>
Sighting Dutch intruders at Manila Bay, Spanish authorities
commandeered what seemed to be an available vessel and converted it into a
warship, loading her with guns and cannons.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#24:1>
A stockpile of more than 750 jars contained provisions for a longer
journey than just a battle at the Bay.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#25:1>
An astute scholar has conjectured that the San Diego was probably
prepared to give chase all the way to the Straits of Malacca, even to wait
for favorable winds in order to head back. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#26:1>
A furious battle at the Bay sank the San Diego.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#27:1>
Almost four centuries after this event, a concerted effort by French
maritime explorers and our National Museum, using state-of-the-art
technology, located the wreck off Fortune Island and proceeded to retrieve
the artifacts from under the sea. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#28:1>
Conservators chiseled away years of accumulated debris and coral
encrustation to bring back the various objects to almost their original state
notwithstanding almost 400 years of burial under the ocean. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#29:1>
The <mention> San Diego Exhibit I </mention> illustrates a number
of objects relating to life in Manila circa 1600 A.D.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#30:1>
Among these are wooden <foreign> <it> santos </it> </foreign> and
furniture from the period.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#31:1>
There are also huge canvasses depicting scenes from the Galleon
Trade, European royalty, ships at sea and maps as well as a glass-enclosed
wooden replica of a Manila Galleon. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#32:1>
Other cases display artifacts still encrusted with coral debris
together with cleaned specimen.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#33:1>
Impressive are three large cannons with cannonballs against a
backdrop of galleons heaving mightily in a restless sea. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#34:1>
<mention> Exhibit II </mention> greets the visitor with a
panorama of stoneware jars, of all shapes and sizes, in various stages of
&ldquo; undress &rdquo; ( its glazes worn off and the earthen body exposed).

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#35:1>
They are innovatively displayed in a rough and tumble fashion,
probably in much the same manner they would be piled up as they await their
turn to be loaded onto the ships. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#36:1>
<h> <bold> Jars from all over </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#37:1>
Not made in the Philippines, these jars have come from various
factories in Asia - - one more proof of the vast network connecting Manila
with other port cities.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#38:1>
Jars, being the preferred container in Asia where barrels and casks
would have been used in Europe, were used and reused over the centuries
until, of course, they broke and had to be discarded.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#39:1>
There were Burmese jars, also called <foreign> <it> martaban </it>
</foreign> ( after a port city in the Burma coast through which they were
shipped in the 15th to 17th centuries), Thai jars which were probably the
most numerous, and Chinese jars distinct for their designs of dragons with
writhing bodies.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#40:1>
In some jars the dragons climb up to the neck to form the lug
handles. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#41:1>
Other jars had animal motifs such as tigers and squirrels or
floral designs of lotus connected by undulating vines and tendrils.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#42:1>
A common feature of other shipwrecks of the period were Spanish jars.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#43:1>
They contained olives and olive oil which must have been an important
cooking ingredient for Iberians on a long sea journey. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#44:1>
An array of attractive blue and white Chinese porcelain from the
Kangxi period ( 1662-1722) must have been intended to furnish the Captain 's
table as well as serve the elite staff on board.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#45:1>
These are bottles with a bulbshaped mouth to hold wines and liqueur,
cups from which to sip them, plates, saucers and bowls and large platters to
complete the services for what must have been an elegant table. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#46:1>
Deer - - believed by the Chinese to be the only animal which can
find the sacred fungus or <foreign> Ling Zhi </foreign> , a plant of long
life and immortality and the <mention> &ldquo; Three Friends &rdquo;
</mention> motif of bamboo, pine and prunusy - - decorate these vessels. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#47:1>
<h> <bold> What it 's like inside </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#48:1>
For the more humble Filipino crew, there were earthenware vessels
with imbedded ceramic shards for decoration.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#49:1>
This is believed to have been a type of Manila ware produced during
the period.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#50:1>
Other than common cooking and eating utensils, lighting fixtures were
also found.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#51:1>
A pouring vessel with a humanlike feature on its handle and a pitcher
with rounded body and painted vegetal motif were probably remnants of
previous sojourns in Mexico.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#52:1>
They are reminiscent of <foreign> Puebla </foreign> pottery which
were frequently based on European models. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#53:1>
Chemical analysis reveal some of the original contents left over
in some jars, such as fowl bones, peach pits, hazelnuts and coconut husk.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#54:1>
Adequate provisions of food and drink could make or break a journey.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#55:1>
Sailors were often struck with nutrition-deficiency diseases due to
lack of food and potable drinking water as well as poor sanitation during
long voyages. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#56:1>
Other items on display easily call to mind what life on board
ship must have been like.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#57:1>
A mortar and pestle as well as glass decanters, pincers and razors
could have made up an apothecary 's implements or a barber 's kit.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#58:1>
A ship 's chronicler such as Pigafetta on Magellan 's voyage, had his
writing implements and ink slabs.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#59:1>
Chess pieces and buttons from board games must have whiled away long
hours at sea.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#60:1>
A man of God was always on board to minister to the men 's spiritual
needs and in this case, left behind his rosary and prayer book clasp. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#61:1>
Except for a few strings of gold necklaces and rings, no
significant amount of jewelry was found.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#62:1>
Sundry coins from Spain, Mexico, China, Southeast Asia and India
could have made up the men 's pocket money to pay for games or alcohol on
board the ship. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#63:1>
A significant find was Captain Morga 's seal.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#64:1>
It has been favorably compared to a Coat of Arms illustrated on the
cover of his book <mention> &ldquo; <foreign> Sucesos de las Islas Filipinos
</foreign> . &rdquo; </mention> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#65:1>
<h> <bold> Repository for heart and soul </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#66:1>
The former Finance building will eventually house the archeology,
anthropology, and social history collections.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#67:1>
The Executive House which is where the administrative office of the
National Museum is located, will open in 2001 as the National Museum of Art.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#68:1>
The Tourism building scheduled to be opened in the year 2003 will be
the National Museum of Nature.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#69:1>
These edifices will undergo renovations in their interiors to convert
them into <quote> &ldquo; world-class museum buildings with state-of-the-art
technology" </quote> in terms of environment controls ( humidity,
temperature), exhibition presentations, conservation laboratories and
artifact storage. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#70:1>
It is a most auspicious beginning, a much-hoped-for repository
for the heart and soul of the National Museum system.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#71:1>
A truly revitalized National Museum, however, must necessarily
include a fresh mandate for the professionals that give it life and meaning,
and, last but not least, the support of the general public that it seeks to
inspire. </p> </I>

IF you happen to pass by the Cultural Center of the Philippines
grounds these days, don't be surprised if you see hundreds of red flags on
bamboo poles, as well as multi-colored banners ( with tinkling little bells
to boot), fluttering in the wind.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#76:2>
Or, if you have time to stroll by the <indig> Liwasang Agyu </indig>
( a grassy lawn near the Ferry Terminal), you 'll be greeted by a fascinating
structure made up of pieces of mirrors and wooded posts looking suspiciously
like a shrine. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#77:2>
The Centennial fever is really beginning to heat up as the CCP
opens another exhibit, <mention> the <indig> Sining Sentenaryo </indig> :
Installation Art Centennial Exhibition </mention> , featuring major works by
three of the country 's recognized installation artists.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#78:2>
Until May 31, the public will be able to observe and experience the
works of Luis Enano Yee Jr., more popularly known as Junyee, Sandra Torrijos
and Gerardo Ingco.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#79:2>
Instead of a stuffy, four-cornered gallery, the works are found
outdoors where nature and art blend wonderfully and effortlessly. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#80:2>
<quote> &ldquo; We want to create a community event which allows
the participation of people, &rdquo; </quote> says CCP vice president and
artistic director Nestor Jardin.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#81:2>
<quote> &ldquo; We saw the [ CCP] grounds as a wonderful canvas for
creation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#82:2>
The Centennial has provided this opportunity.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#83:2>
We couldn't limit ourselves to creating drama and dance projects to
celebrate the Centennial.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#84:2>
Although installation art is relatively new in the public 's
consciousness, we were never lacking in proposals in the past for this type
of art but due to lack of finances, we weren't able to push through with
installation projects. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#85:2>
According to Sid Hildawa, officer-in-charge of the museum and
galleries division, the three artworks were chosen from among 26 proposals
they received.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#86:2>
<quote> &ldquo; <indig> <it> Sining Sentenaryo </it> </indig> is one
of the CCP 's flagship projects.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#87:2>
We wanted to have an exhibit of a contemporary artform designed for
the outdoors where people can freely walk around and contemplate on the works
in a natural environment, &rdquo; </quote> he says.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#88:2>
The winning proposals were selected on the basis of the overall
concept and the materials used, in this case, recycled and indigenous
materials.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#89:2>
The CCP and the National Centennial Commission awarded each artist a
&peso;150,000 grant to build the installation works. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#90:2>
Located in front of the Folk Arts Theater is artist Ingco 's
<mention> <it> Rainbow Banners </it> </mention> consisting of 100 colorful
rectangular banners attached to bamboo poles standing more than 30 feet high.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#91:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Installing rainbow banners is a traditional Southeast
Asian artform which are unique forms of expression.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#92:2>
It has movement, absorbs and reflects energy or light, and it also
creates musical sounds.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#93:2>
It could express a lot of things: a welcome, hope, strength, unity or
an offering, &rdquo; </quote> says Ingco of his work.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#94:2>
The former grand-prize winner in the Experimental Graphics Category
of the Art Association of the Philippines art competition is a veteran of
various installation works as well as <foreign> avant-garde </foreign> and
environment-related exhibits. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#95:2>
The 100 banners, adds Ingco, also reflects the various concerns
of different multi-sectoral groups.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#96:2>
The paintings on each of the banners, in fact, were a result of the
interaction of various sectors such as farmers, fisherfolk, laborers, <indig>
<it> lumad </it> </indig> , urban poor, students, NGOS, among others.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-004#97:2>
The bells found on top of the poles, while mainly for aesthetic
purposes, provide the public a deeper and dynamic experience. </p> </I>
