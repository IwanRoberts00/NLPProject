<bold> Re: </bold> <h> Seminar/Training for Academic Staff </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#50:3>
This is to inform you that the HRD department has devised an
11-point training program for the employees.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#51:3>
Of the 11 training courses, the HRD Department shall decide on the
mechanics of its implementation.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#52:3>
Two training courses however, shall be implemented under the school
directors/academic heads ' full control.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#53:3>
This means that the school directors/academic heads will source out
the possible training courses that their tutors can attend as long as it is
related to the topics/areas as stipulated below, and who shall be nominated
for participation.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#54:3>
Below are the said courses and budgets allotted. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#55:3>
<bold> Name of Training Course : Seminar-Workshop on Teaching

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#62:3>
This procedure is being adopted now because you know what your
school needs are and you know which persons need the training the most.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#63:3>
You may go ahead and participate in the training and utilize the said
budget without notifying the HRD in advance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#64:3>
Please be reminded that once you have determined the training
course that you are interested in participating, as well as the tutor who
will attend it, please do appropriate documentation to include the following

- Summary report of the seminar/training ( to be accomplished by the
participating tutor) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#70:3>
Since we cannot accommodate all tutors to attend all
training/seminars, it is advised that whomever tutor will attend any
training/seminars should echo what he/she learned to the other staff.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#71:3>
He/she should also provide a copy of all materials received,
including his/her notes, to the school for filing and future reference.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#72:3>
The objective is to share resources for the benefit of the entire
school. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#73:3>
The expenses that you will incur in the said training/seminar
should be placed under the item <bold> Staff Development </bold> when you do

<bold> Re: </bold> <h> Fund Raising Strategic Plan </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#87:4>
Attached herewith is the 5-year development plan on fund raising.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#88:4>
The plan is expected to commence on January 2001.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#89:4>
I decided to include in the plan the remaining period of the present
school year since the budget under fund raising is not yet fully utilized.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#90:4>
As of November 30, 2000 Variance Report, out of the approved budget
of <bold> &peso;250,000. 000 </bold> only <bold> &peso;48,206.16 </bold> was
used up for the fund raising.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#91:4>
This brings a remaining balance of <bold> &peso;201,793.84 </bold> .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#92:4>
In connection with this, I would like to request for your
approval regarding the following:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#93:4>
<it> - To install an Internet connection in my own computer and,
increase the computer 's memory capacity </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#94:4>
Objective 3 of the plan ( Internet Fund Raising) rely mainly on the
Internet.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#95:4>
It is also considered the major fund raiser of the plan because it is
where the success of Objective 2 ( Increase Active Donors) depends on.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#96:4>
The more first time-donors that Objective 3 gets, the more active
donors Objective 2 generates.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#97:4>
<it> - Hire an encoder from February to March 2001 </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#98:4>
The main job of the encoder is to gather all data of past and present
donors and encode it in the computer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#99:4>
The total expected expenses for the rest of the school year under
fund raising is around <bold> &peso;111,970.00 </bold> ( see table on page 8
under SY 2000-2001 column.)

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#100:4>
Since the said budget intended originally for Direct Mail was never
fully maximized, and with the introduction of the Mailloop software which is
more economical than the Direct Mail method, I believe that this amount
justifies what I intend to do, given the sufficiency of funds for this
purpose. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#101:4>

I would like to request that funds be made available for the
production/printing of the FFS Official Journal <indig> &ldquo; Punla at
Butil &rdquo; </indig> , that will be sourced from the Fund Raising budget.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#109:5>
This journal shall be part of my fund raising packet or information

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#110:5>
Based on the quotation submitted by PENTAGRAFIX, Inc. ( the
company that will produce the said printed material), it seems that the most
reasonable package to take is OPTION 2, considering the paper, size, color,
number of pages and process specifications. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#111:5>
I have decided to have 2,000 copies printed at &peso;11.60/copy.

Please make <bold> &peso;25,520.00 ( TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND FIVE
HUNDRED TWENTY PESOS ONLY) </bold> inclusive of 10% VAT be available for the
said purpose.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#113:5>
Based on the agreement, we are to provide <bold> a down payment of
50% ( &peso;12,760) </bold> upon confirmation of the job order.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#114:5>
The rest of the payment shall be paid upon delivery. </p>

<bold> Re: </bold> <indig> Saba </indig> Plantation Proposal

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#130:6>
Recalling the feasibility study that you have requested me to
make, I was able to seek the assistance of the Institute of Plant Breeding (
IPB) of the University of the Philippines at Los Ba&ntilde;os, and have come
up with the report that gives us an idea of whether the project is worth
pursuing or not. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#131:6>
According to the outcome of the calculations and projections (
please see the financial income statement attached) it appears that pursuing
the <indig> &ldquo; saba &rdquo; </indig> plantation offers more
disadvantages than advantages, as follows:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#132:6>
1. compared with the <indig> lacatan </indig> variety, it takes two
( 2) years for the <indig> saba </indig> before it is harvestable for the
first time, while the <indig> lacatan </indig> variety can be harvestable in
less than a year;

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#133:6>
2. the <indig> lacatan </indig> commands a higher market price than
<indig> saba </indig> ;

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#134:6>
3. the <indig> saba </indig> from Mindoro and Mindanao can command a
low price of 20-30 cents a piece owing to the volume of produce - the produce
is marketed in TONS rather than by hundreds of kilos only.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#135:6>
In this case we can not afford a price per piece lower than 50
cents;

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#136:6>
4. although we have identified a ready market, we cannot give our
produce the same cost as the Mindanao and Mindoro <indig> saba </indig> .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#137:6>
In view of this, I believe that it is wiser to utilize the land
by planting either the <indig> lacatan </indig> variety, if you still insist
on producing bananas, but in all honesty, planting cash crops/ high value
crops will bring you more profit in lesser time than what the project you are
proposing is going to bring you in your investment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#138:6>
In addition, I have also consulted our board of trustees
regarding your plan and they advised for you to undergo a leasing arrangement
rather than pursue the profit sharing scheme. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#139:6>
It might seem that the results of the consultations and the
feasibility study is a bit discouraging at this point but I am still willing
to assist you by providing more guidance in this respect.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#140:6>
I am willing to discuss alternatives or other plans that you may
have in greater detail. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#141:6>

can.

<bold> Paragraph 6 Under Item
# 3 - Undertakings of PPAI </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#157:7>
- PPAI and / or its designated personnel will be asked to
maintain on a regular basis ...Model Farm House layout in Annex B.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#158:7>
Specifically, the responsibilities will include watering of
plants/trees, weeding, pruning, and replanting of plants/trees ( as needed).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#159:7>
The cost of maintaining the gardens, orchards and landscaped area of
the Model Farm House itself is not the responsibility of PPAI. </p>

<bold> Additional Paragraph Under Item
# 3 - Undertakings of PPAI </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-020#161:7>
- Actual time and speed of setting up of Phase II to IV ( please
refer to Annex A) of the project will depend on the profitability of the
Lettuce Production Module of Phase I and the rate of population growth in the
<foreign> Hacienda Sta. Monica </foreign> , that is, the number of farm lot
owners to be serviced as potential buyers and clients. </p> </I>
