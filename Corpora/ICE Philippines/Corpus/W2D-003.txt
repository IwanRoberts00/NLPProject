<h> <bold> THE UPCAT </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#2:1>
<h> <bold> Admission into the University through the UPCAT </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#3:1>
If you decide to take the UP College Admission Test ( UPCAT) on
August 3 or 4, 2002, you will be one among many thousands who aspire to enter
the University of the Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#4:1>
( Last year, there were over 67,000 examinees.) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#5:1>
While your performance on the UPCAT is important, entrance to UP
depends on more than just your test scores.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#6:1>
Your high school grades are also considered in computing your
University Predicted Grade ( UPG), the final criterion to qualify for the
University of the Philippines. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#7:1>
<h> <bold> What is the UPG? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#8:1>
The UPG is a combination of your weighted scores on the UPCAT
subtests in language proficiency, reading comprehension, mathematics and
science, and the weighted average of final grades in your first three years
in high school.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#9:1>
Each UP campus has its own UPG cut-off that may vary from year to
year. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#10:1>
<h> <bold> Qualifying for a Campus </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#11:1>
To apply to take the UPCAT, choose two campuses from among 9 (
Baguio, Cebu, Diliman, Iloilo, Los Ba&ntilde;os, Manila, Mindanao, Pampanga,
and Tacloban) and indicate them in order of preference on the application
form.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#12:1>
Also indicate two degree programs per campus on your UPCAT
application form and again rank them in order of preference.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#13:1>
Your application will be processed according to your campus and
course choices and in the order you specified. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#14:1>
To qualify for the campus of your choice, you must meet the UPG
cut-off of that campus.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#15:1>
For instance, entry into the Diliman campus is the most competitive
because it is chosen by most applicants ( <foreign> i.e. </foreign> , over
40,000 applicants have sought to enter UP Diliman over the past few years).

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#16:1>
The UPG cut-off for Diliman is therefore the highest among the
campuses.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#17:1>
If you make it to the UPG cut-off of your first choice, you will no
longer be screened for your second choice of campus.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#18:1>
If you do not make the UPG cut-off of your first choice, you are
automatically screened for your second choice of campus. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#19:1>
<h> <bold> Qualifying for a Program </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#20:1>
Once you qualify to enter a campus, the next step is to be
accepted into one of the degree programs you chose.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#21:1>
A screening procedure is followed for this purpose.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#22:1>
Some programs have their own &ldquo; predictor &rdquo; ( <foreign>
e.g. </foreign> , the UPG and predicted grades in specific areas like math or
science).

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#23:1>
Campus qualifiers are ranked according to the degree program
predictor.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#24:1>
Top-ranking qualifiers are accepted according to the number of slots
available for that program. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#25:1>
If you make it to the quota for your first choice of course, you
will no longer be screened for your second choice.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#26:1>
If you don't make it to your first choice of degree program, you will
undergo the same screening process for your second choice.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#27:1>
If you still do not make it, you will remain qualified for that
campus but must then find a degree program that can accommodate you.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#28:1>
Remember, you are an UPCAT qualifier; you only need to find a program
that will accept you.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#29:1>
The campus Registrar 's Office will help you find that program.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#30:1>
Qualification into U.P. is therefore a matter of qualifying for a
campus. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#31:1>
<h> <bold> What if I do not qualify for a campus? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#32:1>
If you do not make it to either of your campus choices you have
several options:

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#33:1>
FIRST: You can try other UP campuses if:

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#34:1>
1. your UPG is within their cut-off, and

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#35:1>
2. they still have available slots. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#36:1>
Present your Non-Qualifier 's Slip ( which will be sent to you in
the mail and which will indicate your UPG) to the Registrar 's Office of the
campus you want to enter.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#37:1>
You will be informed of their decision.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#38:1>
There is no guarantee of acceptance as each campus makes its own
decisions according to its own criteria. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#39:1>
SECOND: If no other UP campus can accommodate you, you will have
to enroll in a college or university other than the UP.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#40:1>
After earning 33 academic units with a weighted average of 2.00 or
better on the U.P. marking system, you may apply for transfer to a UP campus.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#41:1>
Again, each campus has its own rules on transfer and accepts only a
limited number of transfer students.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#42:1>
Information regarding transfer to UP may be obtained from the Office
of the University Registrar at <it> any </it> of the U.P. campuses. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-003#43:1>
