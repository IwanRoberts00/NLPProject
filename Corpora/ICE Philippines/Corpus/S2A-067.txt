Mr President may we explain our vote <X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X2:1:A>
<indig> Mga kapatid mga kasamahan mga kababayan noon pong Martial
Law meron kaming isang kaso sa Supreme Court ng Habeas Corpus
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X3:1:A>
Ang Habeas Corpus po yung nakakulong sinasabing mali ang
pagkakulong sa kanya so pakawalan
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X4:1:A>
Dumating po yung preso nakaposas nakagapos pero sabi ng Korte
Suprema hindi pwedeng nakagapos kung nasa loob na ng korte
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X5:1:A>
Kaya inalis ang posas
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X6:1:A>
Inalis po yung posas pero yung preso all through the hearing habang
kami'y nag-aargumento yung preso po ganon pa rin para pa ring nakagapos
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X7:1:A>
Inalis na yung gapos hindi pa rin mahiwalay ang kanyang mga kamay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X8:1:A>
Sabi po ng mga psychologists yan ang tinatawag na learned
helplessness
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X9:1:A>
Pag ikaw ay sanay na nakaluhod nakayuko at nakatuwad yun muscles mo
po magkaka-arthritis
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X10:1:A>
Kahit ninanais mong itaas ang iyong ulo nasanay ka nang nakatungo
palaging nakatungo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X11:1:A>
Nasanay nang nakatuwad palaging nakatuwad
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X12:1:A>
Nasanay nang nakaluhod komportable na pong nakaluhod </indig> </X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#13:1:A>
So far the issues I have heard have always stressed one theme
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#14:1:A>
The Philippines is weak
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#15:1:A>
Therefore <indig> sandal tayo sa pader
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#16:1:A>
Yun po ang sinabi ng kumpare ko </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#17:1:A>
Many others have said we are weak let us seek the protection of the
big
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#18:1:A>
But who will protect us from the big
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#19:1:A>
Nobody answered
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#20:1:A>
But we are weak
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#21:1:A>
The solitary issue then is will this Special Treatment Agreement
make us stronger
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#22:1:A>
<indig> Yun ba ang sinasabi </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#23:1:A>
Or will it make us weaker
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#24:1:A>
<indig> Dito po pag nagpagapos tayo masasanay na naman tayo
 </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#25:1:A>
The Special Treatment Agreement will not make us stronger it will
make us weaker
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#26:1:A>
And that is why we have insisted we must vote <mention> no
 </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#27:1:A>
Yes we want to be strong but this Special Treatment Agreement that
they call the Visiting Forces will make us weaker
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#28:1:A>
If we follow the logic of those who have said we are weak <indig> 
maghanap na tayo ng padrino kawawa naman po ang mahihirap
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#29:1:A>
Kawawa naman yun maliliit
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#30:1:A>
Pasensiya na kayo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#31:1:A>
Maghanap na kayo ng padrino sapagkat hindi n'yo matutulungan ang
sarili n'yo </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#32:1:A>
And we cannot accept such a principle
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#33:1:A>
That is the result of the colonial experience
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#34:1:A>
Three hundred fifty years <indig> po yun mga haciendero yun mga
pare yun mga may lupa
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#35:1:A>
Sila ang amo lahat ay mga alipin
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#36:1:A>
Makaalis po sila dumating nadaya pa tayo dumating ang mga Amerikano
sila din ang amo </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#37:1:A>
Later on we elected our leaders and many among our elected leaders
felt <indig> kami na ang amo </indig> we must enjoy all the benefits
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#38:1:A>
And that is why we are weak because many among our leaders tell our
people you are weak you are weak
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#39:1:A>
<indig> Pahina ng pahina </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#40:1:A>
And so they become inefficient
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#41:1:A>
And when they become inefficient the government becomes weaker and
then they say you see we are weak because <indig> ninakaw mas mahina na po
tayo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#42:1:A>
Pinapapahinain ang gobyerno pagkatapos idadahilan upang maghanap ng
padrino </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#43:1:A>
That is not what I understand of military courage
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#44:1:A>
One of the mysteries I have had to endure all through today and
during the debate is how my good noble valiant friends in the military have
to sit here and suffer the indignity of being called <mention> we are weak
 </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#45:1:A>
<indig> Mahina ang military
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#46:1:A>
Ako'y hindi po naniniwala
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#47:1:A>
Nakita ko po ito si General Mayo andito
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#48:1:A>
Matapang po 'to </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#49:1:A>
I saw him in Bicol I saw him in Mindanao and I have seen the
valiant people even the enlisted men not being given eight pesos eight pesos
 <indig> ata noon pag sila'y nasusugatan </indig> and they raise money in the
families raise money <indig> pag nasusugatan </indig> because <indig> kulang
ang badget ng militar </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#50:1:A>
I do not share the sentiments of our colleagues who kept saying
here repeatedly that our military are weak
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#51:1:A>
I rather share the sentiments of one of our colleagues who in
nineteen ninety-one said the military of the Philippines is the most
experienced we have fought many wars with meager resources and we have
experience and we have guile and we can win
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#52:1:A>
<indig> Yun po ang paniwala ko </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#53:1:A>
But you must first believe in yourself
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#54:1:A>
The question this then Mr President is how do we become strong
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#55:1:A>
Well certainly not by an Agreement that insults us
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#56:1:A>
Because when you keep accepting insults you will get used to living
without dignity and you cannot be strong
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#57:1:A>
<indig> Hindi pwedeng nag-ba </indig> basketball <indig> e kung
walang kumpiyansa hindi maka- </indig> shoot
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#58:1:A>
<indig> Pagdating sa </indig> free throw <indig> tatangu-tango ang
kaibigan kong si Sonny pagdating sa </indig> free throw <indig> kung walang
kumpiyansa ang lapit-lapit na hindi maka- </indig> shoot
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#59:1:A>
Confidence self belief in self-reliance that is what will make us
strong
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#60:1:A>
And it can be brought about by education
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#61:1:A>
This can be brought about by fighting corruption
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#62:1:A>
Because if we lose only twenty percent of the national budget on
corruption and we can say that we shall have enough money to give bullets and
guns to our military
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#63:1:A>
It is ideas that make people strong Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#64:1:A>
Rizal had the answer to our problems
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#65:1:A>
Unfortunately he seems to have been forgotten altogether
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#66:1:A>
It was Rizal in <foreign> El Filibusterismo </foreign> who said
 <quote> We must win our freedom by deserving it by improving the mind and
enhancing the dignity of the individual loving what is just what is good what
is great to the point of dying for it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#67:1:A>
<X> When a people reach these heights God provides the weapons
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X68:1:A>
And the idols and the tyrants fall like a house of cards and
freedom shines in the first dawn </X> </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#69:1:A>
In another sequel of <foreign> Filibusterismo </foreign> he says
 <quote> As long as the Filipino people do not have sufficient vigor to
proclaim head held high <indig> hindi nakayuko </indig> and chest bared their
right to a life of their own in human society and to guarantee it with their
sacrifices with their very blood as long as we see our countrymen feel
privately ashamed hearing the growl of their rebelling and protesting
conscience while in public they keep silent and even join the oppressor in
mocking the oppressed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#70:1:A>
<X> As long as we see them rotting themselves in their selfishness
and praising with forced smiles the most despicable acts begging with their
eyes for a share of the booty from those who are powerful
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X71:1:A>
Why give them independence
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X72:1:A>
They can never be independent </X> </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#73:1:A>
<indig> At eto pong </indig> Treaty <indig> - ng ito tinatawag kong
 </indig> special treatment that is exactly what it is doing
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#74:1:A>
Give us a share of the all powerful the only superpower
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#75:1:A>
<indig> Mabigyan po naman kami kahit mumog mabigyan kami </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#76:1:A>
We do not deserve to be free when that is the posture that we <.> 
al </.> always take
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#77:1:A>
Even the Americans will not respect us
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#78:1:A>
The Americans were bred on a concept of self-reliance on a
philosophy that the human spirit can overcome and that is why they are a
great country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#79:1:A>
We do not propose to be great like the United States
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#80:1:A>
No
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#81:1:A>
Within the limits of our geography and our people our people are
good our people are talented
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#82:1:A>
Unfortunately many of our leaders had betrayed our people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#83:1:A>
And maybe now they should reexamine whether this Treaty is good for
our people or betrays our longings for dignity independence and freedom <X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X84:1:A>
<indig> Ibon man daw pong may layang lumipad ikulong mo't
pumipiglas
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X85:1:A>
Tayo pa kaya
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X86:1:A>
Nakalaya tayo noong nineteen ninety-one babalik tayo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X87:1:A>
Tayo lang ang ibon na babalik sa hawla </indig> </X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#88:1:A>
Rizal also said and this maybe is the saddest testimony that we can
hear because this is from <mention> The Philippines A Century Hence
 </mention> I think one hundred six years or one hundred eight years ago
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#89:1:A>
And yet it has been unrequited
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#90:1:A>
But Rizal was optimistic he said the Philippines one day will
declare herself inevitably and unmistakably independent
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#91:1:A>
Neither Spanish patriotism call it something else nor the appeal of
all the little tyrants in the colony nor the love for Spain or maybe America
of all the Filipinos nor the doubtful dismembering of the islands the way
they have done in the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and
internal strife the way they are saying let us seek American help so that we
shall have peace and tranquility in the land
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#92:1:A>
None of these can go against the law of destiny
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#93:1:A>
And that law of destiny eventually will transform physical laws put
into action by moral forces
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#94:1:A>
It is the moral force of the Filipino and his courage Mr President
that will make us free
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#95:1:A>
But this Treaty is depriving us of that moral force depriving us of
the courage to stand up and try to stand up by ourselves
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#96:1:A>
Mr President one of our colleagues said we cannot be isolated
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#97:1:A>
Of course
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#98:1:A>
Who has said we should be isolated
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#99:1:A>
Did he name any
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#100:1:A>
Did any of the oppositors to this Special Treatment Agreement ever
said we should isolate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#101:1:A>
No
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#102:1:A>
Nobody said <mention> isolation </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#103:1:A>
We have always stressed that we must preserve our friendships with
our ASEAN brothers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#104:1:A>
The A B Cs of diplomacy America Britain China Canada Europe Japan
and the Latin American countries with whom we have historical ties these are
all sought to be friends
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#105:1:A>
<indig> Hindi pwedeng kabit ng isa </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#106:1:A>
Because how will your other friends feel
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#107:1:A>
And that is why Mr President the reference to isolation was a
bogey man
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#108:1:A>
You raise the straw and beat him to death and say see I have won
the argument
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#109:1:A>
Nobody but nobody has talked of isolation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#110:1:A>
As a matter of fact Mr President I think the push is towards
multilateral arrangements and the Secretary here of <.> Finan </.> of Foreign
Affairs was even pushing for that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#111:1:A>
Because bilateral arrangement Mr President between uh the big and
the small is disadvantageous to the small
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#112:1:A>
And so they say to China <indig> malaki ang Tsina Pilipinas maliit
dapat </indig> multilateral <indig> daw </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#113:1:A>
And yet they do not remember that <indig> malaki din ang Amerika
maliit ang Pilipinas </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#114:1:A>
But the Americans are saying what is good enough for China
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#115:1:A>
Put them in a multilateral arrangement is not good enough for them
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#116:1:A>
<indig> Nakikita nila kausap mong malaki dehado ang maliit kaya
naman pinipilit nila na tayo maliit isa-isa lang kausap nila </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#117:1:A>
That is the reality of the situation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#118:1:A>
The Agreement Mr President truly <,> chains us
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#119:1:A>
What is amazing Mr President is that even reality could not be
considered an argument against this Agreement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#120:1:A>
<X> <indig> Security nang security
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X121:1:A>
Noong una noong si Blair sa Singapore tinamaan ng baltik at
tinanggap na sabi'y walang security ay hindi naman daw security pala ang
pinag-uusapan dito economics
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X122:1:A>
So economics na naman
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X123:1:A>
Sa economics naman pagbasa mo ng Agreement wala naman doon
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X124:1:A>
So wala ding economics
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X125:1:A>
Pero hindi na bale daw
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X126:1:A>
Hindi na baleng walang security hindi na bale walang economics
basta meron tayong kasangga
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X127:1:A>
Napakasuwerte natin
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X128:1:A>
Noong sabihin ng mga ibang mga nasa simbahan prostitution daw ay
madadagdagan aba hindi raw
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X129:1:A>
Nadadagdagan daw ang prostitution kung permanent ang bases
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X130:1:A>
Kung dumadaan-daan lang konti daw ang prostitution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X131:1:A>
Para naman silang hindi nakakaalam
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X132:1:A>
Pag two months kang nasa bapor sa gitna ng Pacific Ocean pag
landing mo sa General Santos maghahanap ka ng makakaraos sa iyo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X133:1:A>
Yun temporary nakakadaming prostitute sapagkat temporary naku
sixteen days lang tayo nasaan ba yung mga Pilipinang magaganda </indig> </X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#134:1:A>
Even reality cannot be used as an argument anymore
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#135:1:A>
<X> <indig> Less daw ang prostitution </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X136:1:A>
Noong una binabandila nila V F A two
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X137:1:A>
Noong basahin ang V F A two at walang mabigay sa Pilipinas sila
mismo tinago na hindi na binabanggit ang V F A two
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#X138:1:A>
Ang V F A two siguro matatawag V F A torotot </indig> </X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#139:1:A>
Because it was a <indig> torotot </indig> agreement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#140:1:A>
We got nothing but a bill of rights from the United States but
that is already granted to Filipinos if you 're in the U S
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#141:1:A>
We must vote <mention> no </mention> Mr President because of
fidelity to the Constitution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#142:1:A>
The Constitution in the Preamble has glowing words
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#143:1:A>
It says <quote> We the sovereign Filipino people imploring the aid
of Almighty God in order to build a just and humane society and establish a
government that shall embody our ideals and aspirations promote the common
good conserve and develop our patrimony and secure to ourselves and our
posterity the blessings of independence and democracy under the rule of law
in a regime of truth justice freedom love equality and peace do ordain and
promulgate this Constitution </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#144:1:A>
The Preamble does not hold water anymore Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#145:1:A>
<indig> Hindi na pwedeng </indig> we cannot have the blessings of
independence <indig> sapagkat tayo ay nagpapatali </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#146:1:A>
We cannot have a rule of law <indig> sapagkat eto lang ang botong
 </indig> third reading <indig> na hindi naman pinagbotohan ng </indig> second
reading
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#147:1:A>
And yet the rules say you must have second <indig> bilang yun
parang </indig> arithmetic first second and third
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#148:1:A>
<indig> Kung walang </indig> second reading <indig> walang
 </indig> third reading
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#149:1:A>
We cannot have the regime of truth because even prostitution
 <indig> mawawala na daw sapagkat </indig> temporary <indig> ang daan </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#150:1:A>
Mr President we cannot even live up to the Preamble
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#151:1:A>
We cannot live up to Section one of the Principles that the
Philippines is a democratic and republican state because in a republican
state there is no law that cannot be modified
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#152:1:A>
But now we must add unless of course it is a Special Treatment
Agreement with the Americans then do not touch it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#153:1:A>
You can touch it later on <indig> pag may nakita kang abuso
 </indig> and that should be modified
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#154:1:A>
Section two Mr President speaks of amity with all nations but now
we must se say except China because <indig> sila daw ang malaki at kalaban
natin </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#155:1:A>
We can no longer say civilian authorities at all times supreme
over the military unless we add except U S military authorities
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#156:1:A>
They are superior both to the Philippine military and the highest
government authorities of the Philippines because the Agreement says so
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#157:1:A>
We can no longer say the prime duty of the government is to serve
and protect the people because we must add unless there is a certificate of
official duty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#158:1:A>
Because <indig> kung may </indig> certificate of official duty
 <indig> at mabaril ang Filipino 't napagkamalian na baboy damo </indig> we
cannot protect the people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#159:1:A>
And that is why Mr President equal protection of the laws is no
longer extended to the Filipino after if at all after this Special Treatment
Agreement becomes law
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#160:1:A>
We cannot allow that Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#161:1:A>
Dylan Thomas once in a poem said <quote> Do not go gentle into
that good night
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#162:1:A>
<X> Rage rage against the dying of the light </X> </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#163:1:A>
If we were vigorous if we were strenuous in our effort to examine
all these Special Treatment Agreements it was because Mr President we did not
want to go gentle into that good night
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#164:1:A>
<indig> Papagapos ka pa nga ni wala ka pang reklamo </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#165:1:A>
There 's one other poem I want to narrate to our friends who may
be minded to listen but certainly to our people who I 'm sure would want to
hear
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#166:1:A>
There 's a poem entitled <mention> Ithaca </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#167:1:A>
It recounts the hometown of Ulysses and Ulysses had to go home
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-067#168:1:A>
And the poem <mention> Ithaca </mention> says I will paraphrase
because I do not have it memorized basically said this <,> when you start
your journey to Ithaca pray that the road is long full of knowledge full of
adventure and said it says do not fear the <?> Leslegonians </?> <indig> yun
po ang mga </indig> cannibals nor the angry Poseidon <indig> yun po ang
 </indig> god of the undersea nor the one-eyed Cyclops it says because you

What you must fear the poem says are the <?> Leslegonians </?> the
Poseidons and the Cyclops that you carry in your soul

It is not the way to become a people with dignity it is not the
way to become a people of independence it is not the way to become a people
