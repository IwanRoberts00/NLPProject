<h> <bold> The Uniqueness of Ateneo Education </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#2:1>
Life at the Ateneo is a journey of discovery: of one 's self, of
others in the world, of God.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#3:1>
Ultimately, it is a journey into God 's light, and a discovery of how
this light can be shared uniquely with the world.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#4:1>
What one gains in his or her unique journey at the Ateneo becomes an
integral part of one 's person forever.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#5:1>
The journey ends in a realization that the mission to be <foreign>
<it> Lux in Domino </it> </foreign> , God 's light in the world, to keep the
light burning brightly through generations, is the Ateneo way. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#6:1>
<foreign> <it> Cura personalis </it> </foreign> - - care for the
individual person - - has always been a guiding principle of Jesuit education
since the time of St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Society of Jesus.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#7:1>
It makes possible the kind of superior instruction that makes rigorous
demands on students while attending to individual characteristics, learning
patterns, and needs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#8:1>
In this spirit, the programs stress student-centered learning, in
which teaching and training extend beyond the classroom, and the acquisition
of knowledge and skills is achieved through a true and reflective interaction
with the world.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#9:1>
This thrust encourages students to be proactive and to take
responsibility for their own learning and growth. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#10:1>
The <it> College </it> of the Loyola Schools seeks to develop in
its students the basic liberal arts of thinking and of communicating thought,
and to bring them into contact with all that is good in their distinctive
Filipino heritage and the cultural heritage of the human race. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#11:1>
At the same time, the College introduces the students to fields
of specialization in which they pursue with greater attention one particular
area of knowledge suited to their individual talents and goals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#12:1>
Through a program of truly co-curricular activities, it seeks,
both on and off campus, to make its students aware of the needs of the
nation, especially of the underprivileged, and to help them recognize their
potential power to transform Philippine society. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#13:1>
The College seeks to encourage its students to strive
courageously towards a more just and equitable world.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#14:1>
It thus seeks to couple the Jesuit educational objective of academic
excellence with a sense of service and justice demanded by our faith. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#15:1>
The <it> Graduate School </it> aims to impart in its students a
high degree of competence in research or professional practice in one of the
academic disciplines.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#16:1>
A special concern is the formation of educators who will contribute
to excellence in the Philippine educational system and, thus, to the
improvement of Philippine society. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#17:1>
In the formation of educators and professionals, the Ateneo
Graduate School prioritizes the need to mold <it> men and women for others
</it> . </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#55:1>
<h> <bold> Scholarship and Financial Aid Grants </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#56:1>
For four decades now, the Ateneo College Scholarship Program for
deserving but financially needy students continues to thrive - thanks to the
many generous benefactors who have extended much needed and appreciated help.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#57:1>
For school year 2000-01, 14% of the total college population enjoyed
a scholarship grant. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#58:1>
Applicants for scholarship must fill out a Scholarship/Financial
Aid Questionnaire.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#59:1>
This form must be secured and submitted together with the Application
for Admission form.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#60:1>
Application for scholarship does not influence in any way the
decision concerning acceptance into the college.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#61:1>
Scholarship applicants, therefore, should not wait for the decision
on their application for admission before securing or submitting a
scholarship application. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#62:1>
Scholarship applications not accompanied by required documents or
with incomplete information will not be processed.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#63:1>
Applicants with sibling(s) currently enjoying or have enjoyed
financial aid in the past are automatically WAIT-listed for scholarship.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#64:1>
An applicant whose family 's annual gross income exceeds
Ph&peso;750,000.00 is normally not given financial aid and, therefore, need
not apply. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-002#65:1>
With very limited scholarship slots each year, the Committee on
Scholarship makes its decision on each application after carefully examining
the results of the Ateneo College Entrance Test ( ACET) together with the
academic record of the applicant, the family 's finances and recommendations.
