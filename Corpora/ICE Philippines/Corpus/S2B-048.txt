 <$Z> <XICE-PHI:S2B-048#1:1:Z> <X> Dr Foronda Dean Bautista Mr uh Bascara Mr Hila <,> uh Dr Palma uh Dean uh Gabriel uh Dr Churchill <,> colleagues fellow students friends ladies and gentlemen good morning
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#2:1:A>
I have the honor and pleasure to have this chance of meeting you today at the opening of the lecture series of the Department of History of De La Salle University in honor of Dr Marcelino M Foronda Jr whom I consider as the father of oral and local history in the Philippines and who is at the same time the incumbent director of De La Salle University Local and Oral History Center
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#4:1:A>
At the outset I would like to congratulate uh Dr Foronda on the occasion of his birthday and uh on the occasion of his uh having been awarded uh the Most Outstanding uh College Teacher of the Year by the <.> Metropank </.> Metrobank Foundation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#5:1:A>
I also would like to warmly congratulate uh De La Salle University for setting up its uh Local and Oral History Center designed to uh promote the study of the various aspects of Philippine history and culture <,> as well as to link up Filipino scholars who are interested in the promotion of scholarship on Philippine local and oral history </X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#6:1:A>
In your academic and scholarly pursuits in this Center you are expected to arrive at the truth of local historical reality and contribute toward the cultural advance of the people of this country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#7:1:A>
Indeed as you move toward the fulfillment of your task in this Center you must carry a tremendous burden
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#8:1:A>
I am aware that the promotion of the study of local and oral history is ever expanding in order to achieve a full understanding of the human experience of the Filipino people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#9:1:A>
Even if your focus is just on the promotion of the study of the local human experience of the Filipino people as indeed the Center is all about there is a great variety of subject matter and themes within each of these subjects and themes laden with their own complexities and emotional overtones
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#11:1:A>
To compound the situation there is a Babel of Filipino tongues to contend with <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#12:1:A>
Remarkably the Center is making progress and its faculty <.> an </.> and staff are moving forward
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#13:1:A>
And I congratulate you for the progress and the advances you have made as this lecture series and the previous local and oral history conferences you have organized uh prove
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#14:1:A>
<X> Dr Foronda just uh mentioned to me a few seconds ago that there 's going to be another local and oral history conference which will be held under the auspices of the Center uh some time during the early part of October on October seven if I 'm not mistaken </X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#15:1:A>
This progress and advance is good for the life of the mind and for Filipino historical scholarship
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#16:1:A>
This is because as you progress and advance in your promotion of the study of the local human experience of the Filipino people you enable scholars to absorb in their minds new and additional information data and interpretations which when shared with the general public will free us from will free us and the people of the Philippines from ignorance and <.> mi </.> misconceptions about our past
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#17:1:A>
The faculty and staff of De La Salle University in the field of history are competent persons committed to the promotion of the study of the local and oral history of the Filipinos
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#18:1:A>
Therefore nothing is really unfamiliar to you insofar as the human experience of the Filipino is concerned
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#19:1:A>
Though you may be unhappy with much that has been wrought by us as a people and as human beings as true intellectuals committed to the search for truth you cannot afford to shy away from the study of anything associated with the Filipino human experience
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#20:1:A>
I realize therefore that you still need a lot of things to cover in your research agenda
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#21:1:A>
Filipino historians today already take for granted the value of local history for purposes of acquiring a true understanding of Philippine civilization
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#22:1:A>
There is a widespread acceptance by scholars in the historical profession both here and abroad regarding the primary importance of local history in enabling us to portray reality accurately and interestingly
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#23:1:A>
<X> <&> the speaker is speaking extemporaneously </&> At this point I 'd like to give uh two examples uh to <.> illus </.> to illustrate uh the virtue of uh local history <,> as uh widely accepted by scholars both in the Philippines and abroad
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#24:1:A>
For example uh <,> in uh the book uh written by uh Jose Maria Sison entitled uh Philippine Society and Revolution there is uh <,,> a conclusion made or one of the conclusions made by the author pertains to the feudal situation in the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#25:1:A>
Uh uh what he tries to do actually is to uh <,> apply the concept of feudalism to the Philippine situation based on uh <,> logical inference and based on uh <,> intuition and <.> onta </.> oftentimes based on uh rhetoric but without being based on empirical uh data or scientific evidence
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#26:1:A>
And uh and actually <,> as a result of this uh <,> uh there is a popular notion among uh many Filipinos about the fact that the situation in the Philippines during the nineteenth century for example and even during the twentieth century can be characterized as feudal or semi-feudal
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#27:1:A>
However uh two American uh two foreign scholars for example uh Jonathan and Fast have written uh a book entitled uh Roots of Dependency and uh on the basis of their study of the forces that were operating in the Philippines during the nineteenth century and during the uh twentieth century with focus on the development of the sugar industry and the <foreign> haciendas </foreign> in Negros which is one of the local areas here in the Philippines uh <,> uh Jonathan and Fast in their book the Roots of Dependency have arrived at the conclusion that the situation in the Philippines was far from feudal or semi-feudal
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#29:1:A>
Rather uh there was actually uh capitalism that was operating although of course the capitalist system or the capitalist forces that were operating were exploitative insofar as native labor was concerned
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#30:1:A>
And uh the the finding of Jonathan and Fast uh is a uh negation in effect of the simplistic conclusion arrived at by Jose Maria Sison in his uh book uh Philippine Society and Revolution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#31:1:A>
Another example that I can give uh pertains to Bicol and uh the book uh pertaining to Bicol actually uh was written by another foreign scholar
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#32:1:A>
His name is Norman G Owen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#33:1:A>
He has written a book entitled uh uh the uh Abaca Industry in in Bicol and Prosperity without Progress or words to that effect
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#34:1:A>
And uh and uh in effect uh his conclusion is that uh in Bicol as a result of the uh linking up of uh the abaca plantations that were <.> for </.> that were uh formed and uh established and which were linked up with the international uh capitalist markets in uh other countries or abroad <,,> a measure of uh prosperity was enjoyed by the people of uh the Bicol peninsula in contrast to the usual sweeping or facile generalization that uh colonialism uh was uh detrimental to the welfare of the people of uh <,> all parts of the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#36:1:A>
But in the specific case of Bicol uh Norman Owen actually found out that uh there was prosperity and that uh to a large extent colonialism was responsible in promoting this prosperity and that uh there was uh satisfaction on the part of uh the uh people of Bicol with regard to the existence of the colonial system as they knew it uh in the Bicol peninsula because of the opportunity that this gave them to link up with the capitalist markets for purposes of exporting their products their product namely abaca which was uh in great demand in the foreign market
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#37:1:A>
So these two examples uh that I 've given you illustrate uh the primary virtue of uh of of local history for purposes of uh of uh <,> looking at uh specific regions or looking at particular areas in order to uh understand the underlying detail and the underlying uh reality uh taking place uh within uh these specific areas or localities 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#38:1:A>
And oftentimes we see that uh the reality that we find out in the local areas that we study and that we subject to local historical scholarship the reality is in contrast to the oftentimes facile generalizations made in uh national histories
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#39:1:A>
This is because uh from the point of view of scholars advocating local history uh local history itself represents a grassroots approach that emphasizes the vital human quality of the past <,> the way people lived felt thought and what their experiences are as a product of their feelings and thoughts </X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#40:1:A>
Local history has been accepted as a good way of exploring the realities of human life at the grassroots and thus gives the discipline of history a socio-behavioral dimension
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#41:1:A>
The spread of local history represents the major development in Philippine historiography during the past generation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#42:1:A>
This is not to say that there was no local history before the war
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#43:1:A>
There was local history in the pre-war period but it spread in the post-war period and especially within the past twenty years or so was phenomenal
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#44:1:A>
Based on my observation of Philippine historiography the spread of local history took place because of the influence of what is known as the <mention> new history </mention> on Filipino scholars
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#45:1:A>
New history emerged because of the realization by scholars that things must be looked up in the round
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#46:1:A>
The advocates of new history reacted against the dominance in past historiography of historians who stressed political history
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#47:1:A>
However the new historians who distinguish themselves as economic or social historians as seen apart from political historians insisted that the political facts habitually included within the historian 's purview told only part of the story and were themselves not to be fully understood in the absence of economic and social facts
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#48:1:A>
The advocates of new history equip themselves with intellectual and <.> methodolo </.> methodological tools drawn from the social sciences as well as from the humanities but mainly from the former
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#49:1:A>
They are committed to studying history from the bottom up rather than from the top down
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#50:1:A>
So that in effect this represents a major shift in focus from top level history to the grassroots approach
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#51:1:A>
They are interested in studying the grassroots of civilization and in the process they inevitably face the question of how the masses had lived and thought and reacted in the past
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#52:1:A>
This new breed of historians in the Philippines for example had begun to realize that whereas they had considerable information about Manila-based rulers and how they had exercised their power they the new historians had little or none about the people in the countryside and how they responded
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#53:1:A>
Moreover there was recognition that previous historians had known something about the literary and artistic highlights going on in Manila but little of the mass culture from where these highlights stood out
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#54:1:A>
In other words very little was known about the manner of living and the processes of change going on which affected the multitudes out in the villages and towns of the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#55:1:A>
It was recognized that the values and experiences of the villagers and townspeople were at variance with those of the dominant elites based in Manila
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#56:1:A>
Thus this led to the increasing emphasis by Filipino historians in the study of local history
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#57:1:A>
And this further led to the founding of the national conference of national conference on local history in nineteen seventy-eight in which Dr Foronda Dr Churchill Dr Samuel K Tan Dr Resill B Mojaris Dr Mamitua D Saber and the late Professor Alfredo T Tiamson played a significant and leading role
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#58:1:A>
This annual conference has since then become the foremost venue or forum for the presentation of the latest trends and findings in Philippine local history
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#59:1:A>
After the first conference that took place in nineteen seventy-eight in Cagayan de Oro a conference took place in uh Dumaguete City in nineteen seventy-nine in Bacolod in nineteen eighty in Cebu City in nineteen eighty-one in Iligan City in nineteen eighty-two in Quezon City in nineteen eighty-four in Surigao City in nineteen eighty-five in General Santos City in nineteen eighty-seven in Butuan City in nineteen eighty-eight again in General Santos in nineteen eighty-nine and uh last year nineteen ninety uh it was held in Naga City and this year it 's going to be held in Marawi City with the papers generated by this important scholarly gathering <,> published in the Journal of History of the Philippine National Historical Society <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#62:1:A>
The institutionalization of the Local and Oral History Center at De La Salle University is further proof that local history is here to stay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#63:1:A>
This is complemented by the establishment and existence in different parts of the Philippines of such regional study centers like the Center for Northern Luzon Studies at Saint Mary 's College in Bayombong Nueva Ecija <,> the Center for Leyte Samar Studies at Divine Word University in Tacloban City the Center for Negrense Studies at the University of Saint La Salle in Bacolod City the Cebuano Studies Center at the University of San Carlos in Cebu City the Center for Western Visayan Studies at U P Visayas in Iloilo City the Research Institute for Mindanao Culture at Xavier University in Cagayan de Oro City and the Ethnic Samal Studies Center at Mindanao State University in Tawi-Tawi not to mention the Cordillera Studies Center in U P Baguio and uh the uh Sharif Kabungsuan Cultural and Studies Center in Cotabato City
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#64:1:A>
With regard to oral history <,> oral literature and popular literature I can say that they are useful in shedding valuable light on the values attitudes and experiences of the non-literate many or the inarticulate and <.> sem </.> semi-literate masses of Filipino society as well as on the processes of social change affecting them
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#65:1:A>
Within the context of the agrarian tradition of the Philippines one cannot be content interpreting past change only from the evidence of official records written by the dominant elites in politics and in the economy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#66:1:A>
The oral and popular literature of the people will surely give illumination to the lives and activities of what we call the common <indig> tao </indig> or Juan de la Cruz
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#67:1:A>
<X> And uh let me cite the oral history project uh headed by Dr Foronda himself under the auspices of De La Salle University uh towards the furtherance of uh of oral history not only as a methodology but as a component uh towards uh shedding valuable light on how we as a people uh live uh in our uh daily existence </X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#68:1:A>
The field or discipline of anthropology in particular will be will be and in fact is most useful to the Filipino historian in his quest for a better understanding of the oral and popular literature of the Philippines for purposes of illuminating the life and experiences of the masses
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#69:1:A>
This is because the anthropologists do not generally have pre-conceptions about the societies they seek to study and because they view the culture of a society as an integral whole
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#70:1:A>
Useful to the local and oral historian in his quest for an understanding of the grassroots of Filipino civilization is folklore as a source of social history
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#71:1:A>
This is because in folklore we see the people as human beings and we see them being both the historians as well as the history in which they tell their own story in their own words
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#72:1:A>
History and folklore are inextricably bound because they do not simply have a common ground but they are actually one and the same ground
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#73:1:A>
Through this interrelationship we are able to gain insight into the emotions and consciousness of the people and communities we are studying
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#74:1:A>
We also go to the roots and sources of society in which the people are living
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#75:1:A>
At the same time this interdisciplinary mode of analysis that local and <.> or </.> oral history engenders does not deflect us from the day-to-day needs of the people of the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#76:1:A>
We know that resources are scarce which means that local historians must likewise be devoting their attention to environmental change and to such questions like do they still see their forebears as still in possession of their forest lands or are they finding them displaced and is is there anything being done
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#77:1:A>
In other words we who are engaged in local and oral history while we should value and support our traditions and heritage as a people must not lose sight of the fact that the Philippines has serious socio-economic political and environmental problems
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-048#78:1:A>
And therefore we must also devote our attention towards doing scientific and empirical research within the framework of local and oral history <,> research that will have results which can serve as inputs toward the formulation of new policies including alternative policies that will bring greater benefit <&> end of tape </&>
