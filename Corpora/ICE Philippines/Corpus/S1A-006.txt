<I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#1:1:A>
What what 's the breakdown

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#2:1:B>
Uh we usually share depends on how many are we we divide it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#3:1:A>
Okay

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#4:1:B>
Even cleaning of the room we even have to pay because normally
I was in an office even it it 's government even if it was government we
would have a utility worker or somebody among the staff members to clean the
room
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#5:1:B>
But here even if I think there 's a person really supposed to be a
utility worker position I entered that office already with a with the system
wherein somebody will clean the room and each of us will pay a certain amount
per month
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#6:1:B>
Uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#7:1:A>
Uh so it 's like you 're paying this guy he 's he 's your
employee

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#8:1:B>
Well our employee in terms of cleaning but we just give a
minimal amount and she cleans the room after we leave the office

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#9:1:A>
Is this an everyday thing
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#10:1:A>
So you pay her monthly

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#11:1:B>
Yeah we do pay her monthly it 's up uh we have this certain
amount and uh the thing with my room there 's there are windows but it 's not
like you can open and it 's small
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#12:1:B>
Just like when there 's brown-out it 's so hard uh for us to see
because we 'll just depend on that glass window or the sunlight to come in if
there 's a sun shining

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#13:1:A>
So what happens if like there 's a black-out a brown-out

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#14:1:B>
Uh they have to open the door downstairs and

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#15:1:A>
The room must be very dark

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#16:1:B>
It is except for the one the mezzanine wherein the light
through the outside would penetrate just a small portion

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#17:1:A>
And what else do you have to pay for aside from the janitress

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#18:1:B>
Well if we don't have enough supplies for materials <{> <[> 
 <unclear> words </unclear> </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#19:1:A>
<[> You mean </[> </{> for the supplies also

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#20:1:B>
Sometimes sometimes like ballpens you know you end up buying 'cause
if they don't have enough supply how many are we there in the office or they
run out of supply rather than wait we have to be on our own
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#21:1:B>
So the money we bring home aside from the taxes would be spent for
those other expenses
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#22:1:B>
But you know it 's not like it 's all the time
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#23:1:B>
Minimal sometimes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#24:1:A>
But you 're not reimbursed for it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#25:1:B>
No maybe because we 'd I don't think they really made an
attempt <.> bec </.> if you look at it will you want to reimburse ballpens or
 <{> <[> <unclear> words </unclear> </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#26:1:A>
<[> <indig> O </indig> </[> </{> but all these things add up

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#27:1:B>
That 's true but when I got there that was already the system
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#28:1:B>
That 's how they deal with it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#29:1:B>
They pay a certain amount for this or that so I just follow
whatever <indig> oo </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#30:1:A>
So doesn't does this this situation doesn't it make you
consider uh working in an <.> off </.> a private <{1> <[1> firm </[1> where
 <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> you don't have to pay for all these things

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#31:1:B>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#32:1:B>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#33:1:B>
Yeah
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#34:1:B>
Uh actually right now I 'm not really thinking of that maybe
because I have so much to learn wherein in this office I 'm learning Uh so
maybe it 's not like I 'm planning on going or or leaving that office
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#35:1:B>
Uh you just have to make some sacrifices and at the same time right
now I 'm just having a positive attitude to enjoy working there because at
least what makes it more bearable is I have good officemates

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#36:1:A>
Why did you transfer anyway from the your old office which is
also a government office right

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#37:1:B>
That 's true
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#38:1:B>
Uh because at that time I wasn't a lawyer yet and uh my work
involved more uh administrative not so much with the legal work
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#39:1:B>
But because uh it was time already to go and practice and uh it was
a suggestion from my mom and okay we 'll try it and I did
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#40:1:B>
Of course in the beginning it was not that easy because so many
things you have to learn

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#41:1:A>
You mean you couldn't you couldn't work as a lawyer in that
old office <{> <[> <unclear> words </unclear> </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#42:1:B>
<[> Nah </[> </{> as a lawyer no because it was <.> limit </.> 
it was more administrative position so now since if I wanted to practice uh I
had to find another job

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#43:1:A>
<{> <[> And this pays <.> be </.> </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#44:1:B>
<[> This was the one </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#45:1:A>
This pays better than the old one

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#46:1:B>
Not really because it 's the same salary grade <.> a </.> as a
matter of fact I think I 'm getting lesser compensation but it 's more of
what is important to learn or to earn
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#47:1:B>
And I guess I wanted to

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#48:1:A>
Both <O> laughs </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#49:1:B>
Both ideally but you know you can't have everything so maybe
the first thing is to learn something first you know and have the right to do
so <indig> yon </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#50:1:B>
So <indig> ano </indig> more or less it 's manageable

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#51:1:A>
So you 're happy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#52:1:A>
You 're happy

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#53:1:B>
I 'm happy because I mean I 'm meeting other people although
that 's the time it could be a test because you don't know the personalities
and they just show you you know you 're being treated in different ways or
you treat them also depending on their level or what they would uhm you know
how they carry themselves or how you carry themselves to help them

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#54:1:A>
What sort of people <indig> ba </indig> do you have to deal
with

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#55:1:B>
Uh well all kinds but of course you can't say the top echelon
because since we 're government it 's more of free legal service for them so
it 's not those who really are moneyed
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#56:1:B>
More or less I guess from the middle class or lower class but most
of them their fights involve neighborhood misunderstandings <indig> e
 </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#57:1:A>
<{> <[> Criminal </[> cases

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#58:1:B>
<[> They </[> criminal
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#59:1:B>
Criminal only so uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#60:1:A>
Neighborhood fights but did you have really serious ones like
rape

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#61:1:B>
Uh not handling that yet 'cause since I 'm relatively new I
have only this particular court wherein these are the cases handled for this
court so rape no not yet
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#62:1:B>
But we have this uh thing wherein for investigation we if we 're
assigned with let 's say that kind of case we can <.> rev </.> we can look at
it if there is a basis for filing the complaint or not
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#63:1:B>
But you know as I said my <.> posi </.> I 'm I 'm still learning
and my position is not high enough in comparison to the other people there so
we also have uh particular cases assigned wherein slowly they 're adding or
making it a little more uh serious or complicated cases but not like the
other uh people who have more serious charges

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#64:1:A>
<.> Y </.> you find this fulfilling <indig> ba </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#65:1:B>
Well in terms of public service yes <{> <[> <,> </[> because
you feel like you 're giving so much of your time and effort and you don't
expect anything from them
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#66:1:B>
Sometimes you 're not even appreciated but you have to get used to
the job that it 's really like that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#67:1:B>
That 's how life is
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#68:1:B>
It 's more of how were you when you wanted to help them or do what
is expected from you

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#69:1:A>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#70:1:A>
What what 's the most serious case that you 've ever handled
outside of the neighborhood squabbles to date

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#71:1:B>
But you know most of them are some like B P twenty-two it 's
like collection of money wherein they didn't their check bounced and they
didn't pay so sometimes you know they just need more time for them to settle
the problem or their financial situation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#72:1:B>
Some of them involve uh you know like one said this slanderous
remarks <{> <[> <,> </[> or there 's a threat by this or that person or acts
of lasciviousness

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#73:1:A>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#74:1:A>
Yes do you uh yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#75:1:B>
There 's also but not that many

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#76:1:A>
<.> Wha </.> have you

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#77:1:B>
No

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#78:1:A>
What case have you handled which is do you have anything
handled anything that 's been like a funny one

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#79:1:B>
Oh yeah <{> <[> yeah </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#80:1:A>
<[> Humorous </[> </{> case

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#81:1:B>
There 's one when it started I think with the feces of a dog

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#82:1:A>
Uh huh and then what happened
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#83:1:A>
<{> <[> What </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#84:1:B>
<[> And </[> </{> then they started saying something and that 's
when the complication began and so that 's when the fight <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> 
and the the complaints you know <{2> <[2> <unclear> words </unclear> </[2> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#85:1:A>
<[1> So </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#86:1:A>
Who sued <[2> whom </[2> </{2> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#87:1:B>
Uh whoever was the one who said something bad first or someone
who uh would fight or have some physical injuries but sometimes it ends they
end up also charging the other so it 's <{> <[> like a charge and counter
charge </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#88:1:A>
<[> But like about this one about the dog </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#89:1:B>
Uh what about the

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#90:1:A>
The owner charge <{> <[> was </[> charged

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#91:1:B>
<[> No </[> </{> the one when they were mentioning about the
dog uh and somebody and the neighbor who owns the dog said something bad so
the one who <.> recei </.> who was the recipient would be the one to complain

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#92:1:A>
So this is <{> <[> what </[> a slander case

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#93:1:B>
<[> And </[> </{> uh sometimes threats

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#94:1:A>
<{> <[> Uh huh </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#95:1:B>
<[> Including </[> </{> <.> slan </.> uh oral defamation and
then I was some that 's why I would kinda I would find it funny because
imagine it started just with the feces of a dog and then funny is I had
another court I had to appear in another court as a trouble-shooter 'cause
the regular lawyer wasn't around and it was also about the feces of a dog
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#96:1:B>
So I <.> s </.> I I felt what 's this
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#97:1:B>
Is this a common thing
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#98:1:B>
For this kind of people always about dogs
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#99:1:B>
Uh hum so I said <{> <[> <indig> ano ba </indig> </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#100:1:A>
<[> So </[> </{> how was this case uh <{> <[> finally settled
 </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#101:1:B>
<[> Well I dunno </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#102:1:B>
The other one

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#103:1:A>
Did you win it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#104:1:B>
No the other one I I was just there for the I think for the
cross-examination which I did not even know about because I was just
trouble-shooting but I was forced by the judge to continue
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#105:1:B>
I dunno what happened but the one I 'm handling I entered into the
picture I think it started already but since I 'm now assigned with that
court I have to continue with uh I still have to present another witness
which is the husband <&> Break in recording </&> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#106:1:A>
<indig> Teka muna </indig> what do you think of Kris Aquino
and her new problem <O> Speaker B laughs </O> with this new married man in
her life

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#107:1:B>
<indig> Ay naku </indig> she has her own way of thinking
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#108:1:B>
<indig> Ay </indig> we I can't say you know it 's hard to judge
especially when it comes to the heart

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#109:1:A>
But what was your reaction
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#110:1:A>
Me I had an initial reaction which was this Kris <indig> talaga
 </indig> she always gets in trouble with the same kind of trouble falls in
love with a man she really couldn't have

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#111:1:B>
<indig> E </indig> but <.> wh </.> <.> wh </.> what can you
do about it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#112:1:B>
I mean you know they 're just what if she really fell in love

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#113:1:A>
Yeah but I think I think there are a lot of other eligible
men but uh I think I think she really is specifically drawn to these men who
are married and <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> and are hard just just hard to it 's a
relationship that 's really full of problems to begin with <{2> <[2> <,> 
 </[2> troublesome relationship

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#114:1:B>
<[1> Uh huh </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#115:1:B>
<[2> Uh huh </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#116:1:B>
Uh huh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#117:1:A>
I think because remember with uh Philip I <.> th </.> they
had the same problem

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#118:1:B>
<{> <[> Yeah right yes </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#119:1:A>
<[> With Philip Salvador </[> </{> and even if this thing
gets settled if they do get annulled the situation is just so complicated
because Joey has children of his own and children with other women <indig> pa
 </indig> aside from Alma

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#120:1:B>
Well that 's true but at this point for me maybe because of
how we see other people what would make them happy sad or what they want I
guess when it comes to the heart <{> <[> <,> </[> it 's hard to judge
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#121:1:B>
That 's the safest answer yes but it 's hard to judge
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#122:1:B>
I mean you can't say when someone falls in love <indig> di ba
 </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#123:1:A>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#124:1:A>
That 's true yeah well that 's true that 's true <O> laughs </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#125:1:B>
<O> laughs </O> Okay

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#126:1:A>
No but at least in my case in my case uh the reason why I 'm
sticking with it and I 'm actually fighting for it is because he 's my
husband and I know that everything is right and it would work out eventually
in the end

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#127:1:B>
Yes it <{> <[> will </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#128:1:A>
<[> But </[> </{> in Kris 's case I think she 's I don't know
uh <,> she 's very intelligent it 's such a waste <indig> di ba </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#129:1:A>
It 's just such a waste

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#130:1:B>
When people expect much from her

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#131:1:A>
Uh huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#132:1:B>
Especially with her family background or her position now in
showbiz and she 's very influential and then in comparison to maybe the guy
who is a womanizer probably or what but still I have that same opinion when
you cannot say and judge when it comes to the heart <{> <[> <,> </[> 
especially with love

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#133:1:A>
<[> There 's this </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#134:1:A>
<{> <[> There 's this </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#135:1:B>
<[> You </[> </{> can't say
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#136:1:B>
We don't know also Joey that well maybe who knows there must be
something in him that Kris might have seen which we didn't know or have seen
that made her feel like loving him
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#137:1:B>
I dunno I don't know him

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#138:1:A>
But but I you know I tend to think that it 's more of like a
rebound thing for for Joey

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#139:1:B>
For Joey

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#140:1:A>
For Joey because he has just had a he was just uh had this
marital problem with Alma and uh he was just working on his that 's uh that 's
the very reason why they they got to meet in the first place because

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#141:1:B>
For the interview I think

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#142:1:A>
Yeah for the interview

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#143:1:B>
<indig> Oo </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#144:1:A>
So if you think about it I don't think it has already been a
year and suddenly he finds himself <.> agai </.> falling in love again

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#145:1:B>
Uh huh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#146:1:A>
And he hasn't even resolved his problem with Alma Moreno

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#147:1:B>
That 's right that 's right

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#148:1:A>
So I think there 's also this element of uh being on the
rebound on Joey 's side

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#149:1:B>
On Joey not on Kris 's side

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#150:1:A>
No because she hasn't been in a relationship I think

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#151:1:B>
For how many years

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#152:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#153:1:B>
Well

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#154:1:A>
It 's very strange because the the profile of these two
gentlemen more or less the same <O> Speaker B laughs </O> still married and
working on the annulment

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#155:1:B>
Uh huh that 's true
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#156:1:B>
That 's true
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#157:1:B>
But uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#158:1:A>
And it 's such a shame because she 's the daughter of Ninoy
Aquino

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#159:1:B>
Maybe that 's it <indig> e </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#160:1:B>
They expected so much more from her and to think with her position
I 'm sure there 'll be other eligible wonderful men who would want to be
there for her but we dunno she 's the one who 's gonna decide on her on who
she wants to love so we 'll see
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#161:1:B>
We don't know

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#162:1:A>
It 's just too bad that 's she 's in the limelight

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#163:1:B>
Yeah that 's why it 's more pronounced and talked about

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#164:1:A>
Uh huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#165:1:B>
Okay yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#166:1:A>
'cause I was just trying to imagine like what she said she
told Joey okay just between the two of us we have we have a dozen kids
already

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#167:1:B>
<indig> Ha </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#168:1:A>
<.> Becau </.> she has she has her Joshua

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#169:1:B>
Oh okay that 's <{> <[> one </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#170:1:A>
<[> And </[> </{> then Joey has his own kids with Alma and
the other kids that he has with these other women

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#171:1:B>
Okay

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#172:1:A>
So between the two of them probably Joey has eleven
altogether plus Kris 's Joshua so they will have twelve kids

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#173:1:B>
And

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#174:1:A>
So and if they have kids of their own <indig> pa </indig> 
then that would be really really complicated

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#175:1:B>
Well there are other men before Joey who also had that kind
of situation with many children hmmm but uh well it 's up to them <{> <[> <,> 
 </[> really

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#176:1:A>
<[> <indig> Oo </indig> </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#177:1:B>
What would make people happy anyway

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#178:1:A>
Yeah
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#179:1:A>
You know there 's this uh there 's this uh quotation that
sometimes I used to think <.> a </.> about it a lot

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#180:1:B>
Which is

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#181:1:A>
Uh <,> which is it goes something like <quote> The heart has
its reasons that the mind cannot understand </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#182:1:A>
And I used to think about that a lot especially when I think about
my own relationship and I think that explains that that explains uh Kris 's
situation right now

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#183:1:B>
Can you elaborate

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#184:1:A>
Like you know you get into you you get into uh all if you 're
very much in love with this person you 'll defy everything and uh even if it 's
just a even if it 's a you-and-me-against-the-world situation

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#185:1:B>
Uh huh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#186:1:A>
You still go on with it and try to fight for it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#187:1:B>
Because is it possible because the heart says so because you
love the person so much

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#188:1:A>
<indig> Oo nga </indig> and you don't think rationally
anymore

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#189:1:B>
So could it be it doesn't mean it 's right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#190:1:B>
Something like that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#191:1:B>
No

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#192:1:A>
No no
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#193:1:A>
It 's actually it 's it 's uh trying what it 's trying to say I
think is that uh a person in love can do the craziest things foolish things
in fact so

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#194:1:B>
For the person

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#195:1:A>
Uh huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#196:1:B>
For that person

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#197:1:A>
For the love for the love

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#198:1:B>
Uh huh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#199:1:A>
So it 's the heart working but if the person doesn't stop to
think about the consequences <{> <[> <,> </[> and the bad uh the bad things
that she that uh might happen because you 're entering into this complicated
relationship
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#200:1:A>
I used to think about that a lot but that was before

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#201:1:B>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#202:1:B>
And now what do you think about that quotation

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#203:1:A>
I don't think too much about it anymore because uh I don't
know I 've found some uh I think I think what I am fighting for now is not
just because I 'm crazy about this person but because I 'm married and
everything is legal anyway

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#204:1:B>
<{> <[> Uh huh </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#205:1:A>
<[> You know </[> </{> so unlike in cases like this in cases
like this <{> <[> <,> </[> everything 's just wrong wrong wrong
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#206:1:A>
In my case morally there 's no problem

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#207:1:B>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#208:1:B>
You 're supposed to be together to <{> <[> start with </[> uh huh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#209:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> so I don't think about that but when I was
younger and I was involved in questionable relationships <O> Speaker B laughs
 </O> then I used to hang on to that quotation

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#210:1:B>
Uh huh because you loved that person even if the legal <.> 
conse </.> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#211:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#212:1:B>
Or whatever consequence

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#213:1:A>
Yeah yeah yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#214:1:B>
Well but you know it 's sometimes we just have to let go and
feel our emotions to know what life is also
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#215:1:B>
Didn't they say was that in the <mention> Moulin Rouge </mention> 
that uh the best or is it the best achievement or what is in life is to love
and be loved in return
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#216:1:B>
Although I know we shouldn't be hurting other people but uh I
still cannot say much about that because it 's so hard when you 're really in
love you 'll never even whatever consequence or true
you-and-me-against-the-world <{> <[> <,> </[> you 'll love that person truly
with all your heart

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-006#217:1:A>
Uh huh </I> 1 1 1
