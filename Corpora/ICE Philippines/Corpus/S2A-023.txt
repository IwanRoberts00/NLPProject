<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#2:1:A>
As I was saying uh in Ayala we have been very fortunate to have had uh one of the <,> not graduate soon-to-graduate uh uh from <foreign> Ley </foreign> <&> name of organization </&> from uh Legal Management one of your very own Rowena Tan who was assigned to us as a student trainee and we are very happy to have her with us and in the <.> pro </.> process uh we got to know uh people like Imelda Lim <,> Juna Mae de Leon and a couple of others
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#3:1:A>
So it 's good to know that the relationship continues uh beyond uh being a student trainee and coming over to your school to be able to share with you uh our own thoughts
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#4:1:A>
Okay uh some of you have class uh after this so we 'll go ahead with our presentation <,,> <O> coughing </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#5:1:A>
What makes Ayala click or what makes Ayala tick as uh the dean was telling me
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#7:1:A>
Well uh I 'll walk you through just to give you an idea it 's one fifteen I want to do some good time management here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#9:1:A>
So what I want to talk about is uh the basic fundamental beliefs that uh make Ayala what it is today and focusing on three principal areas which I will not preempt but talk about a little bit later on
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#11:1:A>
And then go through those three areas and then later on do some summarization and then close it and open the floor to questions if we have time
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#12:1:A>
And so if some of you need to leave the room Nike and Jimmy was apprising me please don't feel embarrassed uh that 's fine
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#13:1:A>
If you have to leave leave and then those who want to stay by all means stay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#14:1:A>
I will be happy to answer as many questions as you want
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#15:1:A>
Uh I asked for leave for the balance of the afternoon so that will justify my presence for the rest of the afternoon here at uh De La Salle
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#16:1:A>
So let 's talk about Ayala and what makes Ayala tick <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#17:1:A>
Ayala is really <,> a holding company and a holding company is a company that is in the business of managing several companies
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#18:1:A>
So the holding company is Ayala <,> the employee force is a hundred and eighty-nine not too many
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#19:1:A>
But when we are talking about the whole conglomerate we are talking roughly of an employee population of forty thousand
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#20:1:A>
So not not big if you compare say to the San Miguel 's or what have you which is very much manufacturing labor-intensive
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#21:1:A>
So when we talk <mention> Ayala </mention> this afternoon we 're talking about the philosophy the rationale the thinking of the holding company and how it concretizes itself in several diverse businesses that it is involved in
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#22:1:A>
Here I flash the logos of several of those companies not not complete
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#23:1:A>
But for example Purefoods which is the flagship of our food manufacturing enterprise <,> the most recent company called Ayala Land which we shall make reference to later on <,> Ayala Life Insurance Company which is the flagship company of our insurance business <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#24:1:A>
Then we have Integrated Micro-Electronics Incorporated which is involved in the semicon industry and the like
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#25:1:A>
And then we have the bank through the unibank the Bank of the Philippine Islands
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#26:1:A>
And then we have the Ayala Foundation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#27:1:A>
You may be wondering what a foundation is doing uh in uh a conglomerate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#28:1:A>
We shall explain that a little bit later on
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#29:1:A>
And then we have a presence in the agricultural side through Ayala Agri
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#30:1:A>
So we 're talking about Ayala and its philosophy concretized through the conglomerate <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#31:1:A>
I hope you can read that uh it might be a bit blurred there for the gentlemen at the back so I will read it out loud
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#33:1:A>
I quote directly from a statement of the person whom we fondly call in the organization <mention> J Z A </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#34:1:A>
J Z A represents the initials of Jaime Zobel or <.> Ja </.> he would say if you wanted to impress him Thobel Tho the Spanish <mention> th </mention> the Jaime Thobel Jaime Thobel de Ayala whom we fondly call J Z A by initials
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#35:1:A>
And I quote uh what does he say
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#37:1:A>
He says in an environment of constant change which I 'm sure you 're familiar with you hear it from your professors <foreign> etcetera </foreign> both domestically and internationally it is critically important for Ayala to be a flexible institution in the long term
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#38:1:A>
Flexibility and the ability to adjust quickly to changing circumstances are very important to long-term success 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#39:1:A>
So I just want to highlight that in terms of the question what makes Ayala click what makes Ayala tick 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#41:1:A>
Well precisely because it wants to respond to an environment of constant change not only in the local scene but internationally as well
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#42:1:A>
And it strives to stress flexibility and the ability to adjust quickly <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#43:1:A>
And here I 'd like to share with you a problem and the problem is Ayala Corporation is one hundred fifty-eight years old
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#44:1:A>
And when your uh group that is that old and you talk about flexibility how do you build in flexibility into your organization knowing that you do have to respond to the changing times to the various scenarios available <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#46:1:A>
In this light <,,> <&> adjusts presentation material </&> we would like to focus on three areas which the company believes are critical components or major publics to be addressed as it focuses on change flexibility in the long term environment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#47:1:A>
What are the three
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#48:1:A>
The first are the stockholders <indig> ang mga nagpupundar sa kumpanya </indig> in the parlance of the Marxists <indig> ang mga kapitalista </indig> uh the employees <indig> mga kawani natin </indig> and the nation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#50:1:A>
So we 're looking at three critical constituents or major publics and this is critical
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#51:1:A>
I think this is precisely why Ayala is what it is today because it tries to balance the interest of stockholders employees and that of the nation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#52:1:A>
<mention> Balance </mention> mind you that word is carefully chosen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#53:1:A>
Because sometimes if you 're an owner you want so much in terms of profitability
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#54:1:A>
And if you talk about profitability in the context of the Mideast War right now you can see the potential profitability of being into the armament business
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#55:1:A>
Imagine if you were manufacturing a <mention> Patriot </mention> or a <mention> patriotic missile </mention> you 'd be earning something like one million dollars a day just for one missile and so many missiles <foreign> etcetera </foreign> plus all the equipment that goes into it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#56:1:A>
So if you 're just thinking of profitability why the arms business brings in tremendous profits
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#57:1:A>
But is that the type of business that you want to get yourself into
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#58:1:A>
I just throw that there or <,> in some M B A classes they show that there are certain types of businesses that give you a big return on investment but you question again what type of service does that investment offer
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#59:1:A>
So we 're looking at three critical components or publics the stockholders the employees and the nation <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#60:1:A>
Let 's look at the stockholders <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#61:1:A>
Those of you who are interested in the financial side you might be interested to know that Ayala has five thousand six hundred stockholders
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#62:1:A>
Employees uh the Armed Forces of the Philippines have invested some of their retirement funds in this uh all kinds of people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#63:1:A>
I 'm proud to say that I myself am a stockholder
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#64:1:A>
Several years back through salary deduction they allowed me to buy into the company and even while I was paying for those shares through salary deduction I was already enjoying the cash dividends and the stock dividends that uh fully-paid stockholders enjoyed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#65:1:A>
In fact uh just to share further when I was putting up my house through a housing loan with the company and I needed extra funds I liquefied some of these shares to be able to add to the construction of the house and until now I still have some of those shares
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#66:1:A>
<indig> Ika nga sabi nila nanganak na nang nanganak na 'yung </indig> share <indig> na 'yon </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#67:1:A>
And my concept is I 'd like to be able to hold on to <.> the </.> those shares and leave a legacy to my family and say you know when you 're old enough hopefully those shares have grown and you have a share or several shares in Ayala 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#68:1:A>
So we 're talking about five thousand six hundred stockholders
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#69:1:A>
In nineteen seventy-six a share was valued at four pesos and twenty per share
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#70:1:A>
<mention> Today today </mention> <&> referring to presentation material </&> is nineteen ninety because the study was done last year
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#71:1:A>
Nineteen ninety including the dividends and the stocks that you would have gained is something like two hundred eighteen pesos and fifty-two centavos per share
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#72:1:A>
So do your mathematics the growth of that share
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#73:1:A>
People in the stock market analyze things like <.> pri </.> uh price and earnings ratio that sort of thing
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#74:1:A>
It grew by an average of thirty-two percent per year and if you factor in the the good times and the hard times because as you well know uh since seventy-six we have had the good times and we have also had the lean times
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#75:1:A>
Profitability rose by twenty-six point two percent on the average and what is the key
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#77:1:A>
The key is to be a diversified and balanced portfolio of businesses
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#78:1:A>
I can be more concrete here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#79:1:A>
I used to be assigned as the Personnel Manager for Purefoods Corporation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#80:1:A>
And at that time the only line that Purefoods was in was in the what we refer to as fresh processed meats <indig> 'yung hamon </indig> hotdog <indig> delata </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#81:1:A>
And we asked ourselves with all the competition going around you uh couldn't rely on one area merely to be able to carry your business
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#82:1:A>
So within Purefoods they were already talking about chicken poultry and uh considering that the lead market leaders for poultry anybody know who 's the market leader for chicken nowadays
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#84:1:A>
Magnolia Magnolia 's number one uhm Purefoods is number four
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#86:1:A>
Considering that it is a late starter in the ballgame to be up there in the big league is to achieve no mean achievement 'cause we came into the ballgame in nineteen eighty-four
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#87:1:A>
But you see what happened in the the times when <indig> delata </indig> or fresh processed meats were down <indig> me sumasalo at ang sumalo dito </indig> was chicken business
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#88:1:A>
And then in the Purefoods we further diversified our export market
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#89:1:A>
We shall talk about that a little bit later on not to preempt that to be able to balance off and diversify the portfolio <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#90:1:A>
Talking about one critical component <,> what makes Ayala tick the stockholders their confidence in what we are doing the businesses that we are in
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#92:1:A>
The second critical component are the employees
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#93:1:A>
Now all of us are familiar with annual reports and they say uh that the single largest asset of the company is not the money it 's the people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#94:1:A>
And you will hear that often said and Ayala is uh not alone in that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#95:1:A>
We also believe that a critical public to address in terms of uh being critical to success are our employees
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#96:1:A>
We are concerned for the quality of life both work and personal life of almost thirty thousand nine hundred thirty-seven work force
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#97:1:A>
Our statistics show that on the average uh you multiply that by five the average size of a family generally speaking is five
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#98:1:A>
So you multiply that by five and you can say that is the reach of the Ayala Group of Companies and if you wish to add the extended ties of families perhaps that will go up a little bit more
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#99:1:A>
We follow a holistic approach to our human resources
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#100:1:A>
That sounds like jargon sounds like uh a technical term
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#102:1:A>
What is what is meant by a holistic approach
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#103:1:A>
Holistic approach simply means thaat we look at the total person we look at the environment likewise in which the employee is at
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#105:1:A>
So we don't only focus on compensation on on salaries we also look at uh things like psychic income
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#107:1:A>
None of you have heard that term <mention> psychic income </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#108:1:A>
It 's good to have pesos to hold in your hand and you can spend it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#109:1:A>
But it 's also good to know that you are recognized for your talents for your abilities
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#110:1:A>
It 's good to know that uh the company gives you authority to do certain things and that gives you a feeling of uh self-esteem a feeling of importance a feeling that you are valuable to the organization
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#111:1:A>
That 's the type of thrust that we have and we do that to things like uh <&> referring to presentation material </&> jumping down a little bit <mention> training and development </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#112:1:A>
We train our supervisors to be able to motivate our employees not only through things like increases that sort of thing but also to be able to turn them on to be able to show that they can contribute and give value to the organization
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#114:1:A>
We honestly say that we are not the top payer <indig> kung gusto mo ang pinakamalaking suweldo puntahan mo mga </indig> multinationals
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#116:1:A>
<indig> Pero ang </indig> multinationals from my experience they really squeeze you dry
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#117:1:A>
After a time they will tell you okay I think it 's time that we get another uh group of fresh blood into the organization 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#118:1:A>
So what do they do
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#119:1:A>
They dangle very nice uh separation packages which is very attractive some become millionaires overnight
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#120:1:A>
So what do some of these people do
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#121:1:A>
They leave they become entrepreneurs or they start looking for jobs again
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#122:1:A>
Ayala 's philosophy is a bit different
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#123:1:A>
We believe that our compensation is above industry average but we also go beyond the legal requirements and the C B A
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#124:1:A>
Uh C B A here refers to the Collective Bargaining Agreement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#125:1:A>
Uh we are in a unionized environment and uh as pointed out a little bit later on over twenty-seven years relationship with the union there has been no single day of work stoppage for the last twenty-seven years
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#126:1:A>
I think that 's uh something to boast about in terms of the type of relationship we have with our uh friends in labor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#127:1:A>
Family needs are are also addressed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#128:1:A>
Seventy percent of our employees own their own house
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-023#129:1:A>
Some of them live in Ayala Alabang and if they were to liquefy their own investment in that I mean we 're talking millionaires since Dindo Pumaren Al Solis millionaires they could be millionaires in their own right because of the advantages that the company has made available to them
