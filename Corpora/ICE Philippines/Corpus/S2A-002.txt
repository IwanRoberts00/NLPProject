There 's uh music blaring from the studios
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-002#22:1:C>
The rally is going to start at about one thirty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-002#23:1:C>
People are expecting uh about thirty thousand uh rallyists to attend the pro-democracy rally organized by President Aquino and uh Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-002#24:1:C>
As zero hour nears the uh police are intensifying their security around the area 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-002#> As you know there was an intelligence report that the Alex Boncayao Brigade may be planning to uh ambush the uh rally
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-002#25:1:C>

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-002#46:1:D>
The rallyists here are converging to express their concern about the recent disturbing events or issues that seem to threaten the democratic gains at EDSA
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-002#47:1:D>
I 'm right here at the corner of Ayala Avenue and Paseo de Roxas 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-002#> The rally should begin at one thirty P M roughly about three hours from now and it should end at about three o'clock
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-002#48:1:D>
What 's going to happen today Coco is that uhm there will be three marches the first marches three marches that will converge here at the corner of Ayala Avenue and Paseo de Roxas
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-002#50:1:D>
The first march will be uhm at the fire station at Buendia they will converge there

The second rally will be at the uh Don Bosco Church in Pasay in Pasay Road and the third will be at the Cojuangco building in Legaspi Village
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-002#52:1:D>
These three rallies should be able to converge here at about one thirty the start of the rally proper against charter change
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-002#53:1:D>
Those who of course do not wish to join the rally can just wait at the sidewalks and wait for the rally proper to begin
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-002#54:1:D>
Those uhm inside their buildings are encouraged to uh show their solidarity by of course uhm raining confettis on the street and for other people to honk their horns at one thirty this afternoon
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-002#55:1:D>
Coco what the rally the rally today is all about is actually three things
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-002#56:1:D>
The first would be they oppose any compromise on the ill-gotten wealth of the Marcoses and their cronies
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-002#57:1:D>
The second would be of course the <.> curs </.> curtailment of press freedom and the third is simply they oppose charter change at the moment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-002#58:1:D>
There are closed portions at the moment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-002#59:1:D>
Ayala Triangle from Twin Tower to Herrera Street is closed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-002#60:1:D>
