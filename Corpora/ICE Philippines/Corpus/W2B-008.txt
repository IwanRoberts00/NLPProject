<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#3:1>
<mention> <indig> <it> Larawan III </it> </indig> </mention> marks
Benedicto Cabrera 's return to the theme that first made him a buzzword among
collectors and the art public: painted retakes of antique photographs,
particularly those taken at the turn of the century.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#4:1>
Though some may quibble at the seeming banality of the act, such a
painterly practice is, in fact, quite an accepted norm in the artworld
mainstream.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#5:1>
Artists have been consciously reproducing photographs as paintings
since the 1950s, when Irish artist Francis Bacon took Edward Muybridge 's
multiple-exposure shots, taken in the 1870s, and transformed them into
brutalized images that conveyed the <foreign> angst </foreign> - ridden
sensibilities of contemporary European existence. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#6:1>
Another development was that of the American Photo-Realists like
Malcolm Morely, Chuck Close and Richard Estes, who rendered the full banality
of everyday life in huge paintings derived from photographs projected onto
the canvas ( the easier to paint it, my dear).

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#7:1>
Of the two currents, it is Bacon 's that is relevant, for he is one
figure ( though not the only one) in the development of BenCab, who lived in
London between 1968-1972, and again from 1974-'88, minus the paranoia and
self-doubt, of course. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#8:1>
For what distinguishes the Westerner 's approach to the photograph
as subject matter in painting from the Filipino is that the former treats it
as a sledgehammer with which to bludgeon the audience into an abyss of
historical guilt, apathy and cynicism; while the latter rejoices over its
power as faded but mystical mirror, refracting the sense of continuity of
Being, and the pride of depicting the Self, especially in lieu of the
historical circumstances of colonialism, and foreign dominance over the
indigenous body and mind.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#9:1>
It is this power of recall that draws us to look at the past, mixed
with a tinge of sentiment and regret, looking for it among the few material
objects that survived the vicissitudes of the past 90 years; and to search
for it among those of us who have dedicated their lives to unearthing and
reinterpreting it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#10:1>
BenCab 's show of 20 paintings, recently at the Luz Gallery
before it makes its American debut at Martha 's Vineyard this September,
proves that some of us have been there far longer than the rest.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#11:1>
This does not, in any way, disabuse BenCab 's ability to render
contemporary life.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#12:1>
From his various prints and watercolors of Filipinos, whether as
streetwise urbanites ( 1974); overseas workers and scholars ( 1978); victims
of natural calamities ( 1990); or as languid musicians ( 1995), BenCab proves
he can dish out modern life with both gusto and sensitivity.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#13:1>
But it is his series of &ldquo; antique Filipinos &rdquo; that has
endeared him most to his public. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#14:1>
The historical connection came early when, as a student in UP, he
was asked to do <mention> Rizal </mention> from a drawing made by Pedro
Coniconde.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#15:1>
Later, while working as an illustrator for <it> Sunday Times Magazine
</it> , he followed the wanderings of a vagrant madwoman, Sabel, along his
old home in Bambang Street, sketching her into a style of pen drafting.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#16:1>
These early forays into social commentary ( never fully acknowledged
by the ideological ranks of the Social Realists) were tempered by his greater
interest in form and composition, juxtaposing the exhaustively detailed human
figure in a neatly defined rectangular empty space, a compositional device
that would recur throughout his whole career. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#17:1>
The test of artistic immortality came in his first London stay,
when he started his collection of old Philippine prints, photographs and
maps, from which he would cull images of Filipinos subjugated and &ldquo;
posed &rdquo; under the watchful eyes of white colonizers and military
photographers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#18:1>
Even before <mention> Post-Modernism </mention> became an abused art
term, <mention> &ldquo; <indig> <it> Larawan </it> </indig> &ldquo;
</mention> ( 1972) was an exhibit that opened <foreign> Manile&ntilde;os
</foreign> to vast vistas, as images of the past now served as artistic
devices of contemporary artmaking, breaking the dichotomy between abstraction
and figurative art in a way impossible to do at home at that time, but almost
second nature to expatriates yearning to reassert their identity in a
foreign, uncaring land. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#19:1>
BenCab has never looked back, though to break the monotony, he
has enlarged his scope to include images of city dwellers, fellow artists,
and urban voyeurs as varied as London punks and Manila <indig> <it> kanto
</it> </indig> boys.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#20:1>
<mention> <it> &ldquo; <indig> Larawan </indig> III &rdquo; </it>
</mention> not only marks the third installment of a theme BenCab has
explored for the past 26 years, but also recapitulates the image of the
Filipina Woman as the Othered, an imagery that has been building up since his
<mention> &ldquo; Sabel &rdquo; </mention> series until last year 's
<mention> &ldquo; Mysterious Woman &rdquo; </mention> series. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#21:1>
The format has undergone dramatic changes.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#22:1>
In the ' 70s, dour, thinly-painted <it> sepias </it> were the norm,
in keeping with the &ldquo; reproduced antique photo &rdquo; look.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#23:1>
Now, brilliant blues battle it out with chrome yellows, vermillions
and sienna browns.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#24:1>
His trademark gestural flicks of complementary color across the
background bordering the figure has also stabilized into a heavier line.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#25:1>
And the women are rendered with the weight and voluptuousness of
European Old Masters, like Michelangelo or Rubens. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#26:1>
Newer techniques, courtesy of acrylic paint, also inhabit the
canvas surface, such as grainy paint of a lighter or darker color overlaying
a bright color like scarlet, done by mixing the flat-drying acrylic with gel
and using a paint roller to apply the overlayer.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#27:1>
BenCab then adds further texture by scratching or combing across the
wet paint, producing rhythmic lines that accent the composition from afar.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#28:1>
The effort has resulted in some of the best figure paintings BenCab
has shown since the early 1990s, when his return to drawing emphasized linear
rather than painterly development. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#29:1>
<mention> &ldquo; Arm Akimbo &rdquo; </mention> reflects his
formula well.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#30:1>
The wary woman with the partly-cropped head ( another BenCab device)
glares at an intruder on her left, her undone left sleeve both an indicator
of power ( seduction, the native disrobing her colonial &ldquo; shackles,
&rdquo; etc.), and of vulnerability. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#31:1>
In <mention> &ldquo; The Gaze, &rdquo; </mention> two squatting
women turn their attention to the viewer, a mixture of wariness, defiance and
impenetrability fleeting through their faces.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#32:1>
This painting marks a distinct usage of drip-paint technique that
heightens the effect of artificiality, and also produces such exquisite
background tonality as that found in <mention> &ldquo; <indig> <it> Tampipi
</it> </indig> . &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#33:1>
Here, the visual dialogue between faithfully-painted woman vendor,
background-foreground and gestural strokes is so distinctly sharpened and
starkly balanced, it could be construed as one of BenCab 's color etching
prints, enlarged and repainted. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#34:1>
<mention> &ldquo; Monsoon Season &rdquo; </mention> brings us
back into an approximation of &ldquo; straightforward painting, &rdquo; where
the subject matter of woman with child in knee-deep floods dominates the
whole canvas, liberated from extraneous compositional encumbrances, but
nonetheless declares its liberation from the illusion of perspective.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#35:1>
This piece also comes closest to the 1972 series, in its sparse use
of color.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#36:1>
<mention> &ldquo; Fruit Vendor &rdquo; </mention> approaches the same
format.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#37:1>
However, the background reverie of red glazes over blue underpaint
ennobles its precocious, long-dead figure into a spirit guide-like
incarnation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#38:1>
Some works belie the art historical processing that goes on behind
the scenes.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#39:1>
<mention> &ldquo; The Huntress &rdquo; </mention> is posed with the
casual aplomb of a Baroque Diana transposed into the tropics, circa 1890s.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#40:1>
And the purposefully stiff pose of <mention> &ldquo; Woman with
Basket &rdquo; </mention> is as much a tribute to Manet ( with unfinished
foliage to boot) as it is an accurate assessment in rendering a photo shoot
with a slow-fixing, cumbersome daguerrotype camera. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#41:1>
Some cynics have argued that BenCab has gone dry, unable to
reinvent himself to an audience that is rumored to be sick of the past.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#42:1>
This, no doubt, is a result of the purgative overdose of
Centennialist hoopla that the nation went through recently.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#43:1>
In hindsight, though, there is no need to worry, either about BenCab
or the Filipino audience.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#44:1>
If consistency is the way towards artistic righteousness, then he has
beaten a path way before anyone else in his generation, or those half his
age, could. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#45:1>
Gangly and quick-moving for a 56-year-old, BenCab has aesthetic
admirers far from the multi-millionaires that snap up his pictures: middle
class yuppies who are rediscovering our tortured history; antiquarians and
history buffs of all classes; or real art connoisseurs who look for both
substance and well-done formal flair.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#46:1>
But perhaps the most poignant are the farmers or factory workers who
hang calendar photo reproductions of <mention> &ldquo; <indig> <it> Ang Tao
</it> </indig> &ldquo; </mention> ( 1972) in their huts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#47:1>
It is to them that BenCab 's imagery strikes the deepest chords,
for entirely different reasons.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#48:1>
Beyond the banality of art hustling, resonations like these are hard
to beat. </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#49:2>
<h> <bold> Impy Pilapil: Searching and finding </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#50:2>
<bold> Reuben Ramas Ca&ntidle;ete </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#51:2>
Like mystical monoliths, the recent sculptural pieces of renowned
artist Imelda &ldquo; Impy &rdquo; Pilapil beckon to the viewer like
indecipherable monuments to the achievement of <mention> ( Wo)man as Builder
</mention> : strangely elegant, towering masses of marble, at times chipped;
and at others, polished to a radiant sheen that captures the imagery around
it, focusing it into what the Japanese call the <mention> <foreign> <it> chi
</it> </foreign> </mention> , the soul, of the rock. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#52:2>
A recent, more restrained ( nay, classical, even) phase in the
artist 's career, Impy 's stone sculptures have mystified and enthralled
audiences since its first major introduction two years ago.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#53:2>
Back then, her starkly monolithic pieces of black and cream-white
marble evoked comparisons with Isamu Noguchi 's <foreign> Zen </foreign> -
like sculptural creations, with their rough-versus-smooth surface texturing,
the combination of grey, black-veined and white-colored stone, and the
allusions to contemplative meditation and sudden enlightenment, like
contemporary incantations of the famed boulders at the rock garden of
<foreign> Ryoanji Temple </foreign> in Kyoto. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#54:2>
We have once again been allowed the privilege of seeing a
refinement of Impy 's aesthetic meditations in a new series, called <mention>
&ldquo; Find Your Truth. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#55:2>
To be mounted at the Luz Gallery in Makati from June 25 to July 14,
Impy 's new pieces are both pensive and mythical: the former, due to its
inherent respect for the otherwise unforgiving medium of marble, resulting in
sleek, vertically-oriented pieces that lead the eye heaven-ward ( and hence,
inducing one into a subconscious state of contemplation, bereft of the
distractions that flailing arms, flowing drapery pose and diagonal details
pose that make representational sculpture so &ldquo; noisy"); the latter,
because of Impy 's masterful re-integration of a design motif that has
endeared her to her audiences, <mention> the Wave </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#56:2>
This unmistakable motif, undulating gently across the mass of piled
marble slabs that actually constitute the building blocks of each piece ( so
that it can be easily dismantled and moved into place), is Impy 's own to
claim. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#57:2>
<mention> The Wave </mention> strikes a deep chord among us
Filipinos.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#58:2>
It stirs the deepest of collective memories: of distant ancestors
reaching the far shores of their destiny aboard wooden boats that glided
across the glassy but sometimes terrifying rough seas that marked the outer
perimeters of the <foreign> Sri Vijaya Empire </foreign> ; of childhood
memories playing on the beach, or growing up to the sound of crashing surf,
while the morning breeze rustles the coconut-tree leaves.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#59:2>
Its power of enchantment may have worked into young Impy as she grew
up in Cavite, only to manifest itself in her various artistic phases, from
her elegantly-designed serigraphs of the early 1980s to her painted metal
sculptures in the mid-'80s, and her famed glass sheet-and-cullet pieces of
the late ' 80s to the early ' 90s. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#60:2>
Its manifestation into stone is a calculated study of subdued
<foreign> tour de force </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#61:2>
The once-energetic curvations have now settled into a
well-disciplined set of semi-circles, subsuming itself into the spirit of the
aged stone.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#62:2>
The use of marble first cropped up in her early-'90s glass pieces,
and since then she has devoted herself to it.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#63:2>
That marble was the preferred choice, for stone seems to be
calculated on several mutually agreeable principles.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#64:2>
One is its extreme age, often running into tens of millions of years
old.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#65:2>
Its rarity and prized sheen also is another.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#66:2>
For this reason, the Greeks hauled white marble all across the Aegean
and Mediterranean to decorate their temples and to carve their gods and
heroes.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#67:2>
To the Asian aesthete, though, marble is more than just a status
symbol.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#68:2>
It personifies the very spirit of nature, its fossilized remnants
serving as reminders of the ephemerality of existence; while its gnarled
veins remind us of its status, in the eyes of Taoist philosophers, as the
very bones that hold the earth together. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#69:2>
A sense of Filipino-ness in form, mingled with a sophisticated
study in Asian aesthetics, prevails in Impy 's work.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#70:2>
The earlier starkness of her 1996 pieces has been modulated and
enlivened, but its sense of contemplativeness is unarrested.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#71:2>
We see this most clearly in <mention> &ldquo; Diary, &rdquo;
</mention> which from afar seems like a straightforward pylon, until you
notice the empty void inside it, lined in contrasting black-grey marble.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#72:2>
The almost complete elliptical chain is liberated, making the viewer
experience a cascade of contemplative associations that allow questions to
creep in. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#73:2>
This approach to meditation is less absolutist ( hence, <foreign>
Zen </foreign> ) , and more dialogic ( hence, <foreign> Vedic </foreign> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#74:2>
The Indian philosophical tradition must be taken into account more
fully within our own historical and cultural context.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#75:2>
After all, Sanskrit is the mother of many Filipino dialects, as well
as ingraining many of our cultural attitudes.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#76:2>
It is this heterogenous but unified sense of Being that Impy Pilapil
has captured so well. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#77:2>
<mention> &ldquo; Quest &rdquo; </mention> also takes a similarly
complex view of introspection.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#78:2>
Formed like a massive, undulating facade with open spaces like
windows, <mention> &ldquo; Quest &rdquo; </mention> creates a paradigm where
the seeker, instead of looking outside, searches within.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#79:2>
The surface helps.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#80:2>
With its accents of chipped surfaces contrasting with smoothly
polished ones, this facade-as-sculpture captures a delicate - - indeed, even
tense - - balance between surfaces and forms, horizontal slabs and vertical
planes, and between solid masses and empty voids. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#81:2>
Such an exploration is especially daring in <mention> &ldquo;
Entry. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#82:2>
The architectonic alliterations are given full rein in this work,
which resembles a classical doorway with curved flourishes for facade
endings.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#83:2>
Openings are especially evocative in meditation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#84:2>
The Japanese traditional <foreign> <it> cha </it> </foreign> house
has a small opening, called <mention> &ldquo; the humble doorway &rdquo;
</mention> where one literally worms their way through the waist-high entry,
symbolizing the humility of every true contemplative.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#85:2>
The decision to walk through this one, with marble-slab lintel
hanging solidly - - though again, propped up only by sheer dead weight - - is
a choice that is made only by believers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#86:2>
Neither oppressive nor imperious, <mention> &ldquo; Entry &rdquo;
</mention> indicates the true nature of <foreign> Nirvana </foreign> by its
all-inclusive, always-open door, but its purposeful entry allows one, in the
words of Impy, <quote> &ldquo; to discover your soul." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#87:2>
The two other pieces, <mention> &ldquo; Path &rdquo; </mention>
and <mention> &ldquo; Solitude, &rdquo; </mention> hark back to the earlier
Pilapil of monolithic stones rising like massive pylons into the low ceiling.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#88:2>
Its horizontal articulations have also responded to the generally
curvilinear main forms that Impy is endowing her other pieces.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#89:2>
This is also enlivened by her intermingling of black versus white
marble in a cross-sectional basis.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#90:2>
Thus, on one side of <mention> &ldquo; Solitude, &rdquo; </mention>
for example, one can see black slabs of marble, while on the other side, one
can only see white slabs.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#91:2>
View it at an angle, or at its midpoint, and one sees both, meeting
in mutually conjoined sections like mirror images culled from parallel
universes.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#92:2>
Its intersection, on the other hand, a seemingly knife-edged point,
slowly undulates forward and backward, its main form wonderfully evocative of
Samal male gravemarkers set on white beaches along the Sulu Archipelago.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#93:2>
Its surface endowments of rough-versus-smooth texture also add to the
dialogue of polar opposites, as united into a single, coherent work that
speaks volumes of silence. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#94:2>
In this age of nonstop urban stress, 16-hour workdays, and
dysfunctional family relations, <mention> &ldquo; Find Your Truth &rdquo;
</mention> acts as a therapeutic site, massaging our hassled nerves with the
simple joy of silence and contemplation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#95:2>
That it also truly addresses its audiences as Filipinos is quite
clear from the formal shapes and conceptual approaches.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#96:2>
Noting that this production is underlain by a fundamental assumption
of faith in materials, joined together but never glued nor reinforced (
except for a little water), shows that belief, tempered by moderation, works
miracles where structural engineers would merely shake their heads. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#97:2>
Truly, this searching of the Self, prompted by Impy 's own search
for transcendence and tranquility, results only in the elimination of the
Outside, and the rediscovery of the Inside.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-008#98:2>
Looking within herself, and speaking deeply and sincerely, Impy
Pilapil has found the milestones to her Fortress of Solitude. </p> </I>
