<h> <bold> Are we losing our rainforest treasures? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#3:1>
WE cannot say we 're not being warned.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#4:1>
How often have we been told that many of our wildlife face extinction,
and if we don't do something about it, we humans will be in a precarious
position. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#5:1>
Environmentalists are no longer content addressing people about
the need to conserve our natural resources.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#6:1>
They are now writing books and more books with photos of what could
happen, what we would lose, if we didn't stop logging illegally; stop
poaching in our forest and marine preserves; if we continued to mine and
quarry without thinking about tomorrow. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#7:1>
The latest warning comes from the book, <mention> &ldquo;
Vanishing Treasures of the Philippine Rain Forest &rdquo; </mention> by
Lawrence R. Reaney and Jacinto C. Regalado Jr., and published by the Field
Museum, Chicago. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#8:1>
<h> <bold> Great biodiversity </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#9:1>
The book presents problems by first showing the great biodiversity
in the Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#10:1>
It is the greatest in the world, considering the country 's size and
the fact that our rainforest wildlife can be found nowhere else in the world.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#11:1>
From that premise, the book goes on to show that to lose any of that
diversity would be tragic, especially since it need not happen at all. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#12:1>
The book explains how this biodiversity came to be: <quote>
&ldquo; . ...more than 50 million years ago, the islands arose as volcanoes
from the depths of the Pacific Ocean... <X>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#X13:1>
Slowly drifting closer and gradually increasing in size, the
Philippine archipelago has been and remains one of the most geologically
active places on the planet.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#X14:1>
At least 17 of its volcanoes are now active and dozens of others are
considered inactive. ..

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#X15:1>
. As a result of this volcanic history, the Philippines is one of
the most fertile and mountainous countries in the world. &rdquo; </quote>
</X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#16:1>
Its geological isolation and gradual approach to the Asian
mainland have had an enormous impact on the country 's biological diversity,
according to Heaney and Regalado.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#17:1>
They believe also that while birds, bats, butterflies and other
flying animals were able to make the difficult journey across the seas, such
travel did not happen often. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#18:1>
Today, 172 out of 395 ( 44 percent) of land birds seen in the
Philippines are found only here.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#19:1>
Among Philippine mammals that cannot fly, 85 or 86 percent out of
101, live only in the Philippines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#20:1>
The Philippines ' rich biodiversity, say the authors, is largely
the result of our climate which grows from hot in the lowlands to cool up in
the mountains, and brings on the annual typhoon.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#21:1>
The climate is also responsible for <quote> &ldquo; shaping the
restricted types of habitats that originally occurred in the Philippines.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#22:1>
The authors inform us that the Philippines is almost on equal
footing with Brazil which is 28 times larger and whose rainforests are move
extensive, as are other places with interesting endemic <foreign> fauna
</foreign> but with less to show despite their size. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#23:1>
Studies by the authors show that at the time Southeast Asia was
beginning to take shape five million years ago, the Philippines, at least the
highlands of northern Luzon, were already well-established. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#24:1>
The land mass that is now the Philippines was formed during the
Ice Age when islands progressively emerged, and merged, which explains why
plants and animals found in one end of the country are present in the other
end, but with entirely different species in the areas between. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#25:1>
The first part of the book describes the Philippine rainforest so
vividly we are almost transported to another world.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#26:1>
The pictures the authors paint in both words and images communicate
the message. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#27:1>
<h> <bold> Five habitats </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#28:1>
Reaney and Regalado enumerate five kinds of habitats in the
forest.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#29:1>
One is the forest on top of mountains, like Mt. Kitanglad in
Mindanao, where the temperature is cool and rainfall so high, plants grow in
thick profusion.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#30:1>
There is where we find the most number of unique species. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#31:1>
There is the pine forest, far from the sea but near other
mountains.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#32:1>
These regions are home not only to the world-famous Banawe Rice
Terraces but also to birds familiar to northerners--crossbills and
bullfinches--and to a rodent called the Luzon bushytailed cloud rat. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#33:1>
There is the mangrove forest, crucial breeding habitats for many
species of marine fish and shore birds. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#34:1>
Limestone forests have a low diversity of plant life, but the
plants that do grow in them like the <indig> molave </indig> tree, tend to be
highly restricted, unique species that provide habitat for unique butterflies
and other insects. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#35:1>
Then there is the ultrabasic or serpentine type of forests
characterized by rocky terrain.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#36:1>
They thus support only a few species of plant life, but many of them
restricted to the Philippines. </p> <X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#X37:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Diversity in the Philippines is therefore
determined not just geographically but also climatically within each island.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#X38:1>
It is [ this] combination. ...that has led to the profusion of life
in the Philippines, not of large numbers of species residing in a single
habitat, but of sets of species unique to a great number of small areas of
habitat. &rdquo; </quote> </p> </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#39:1>
Copies of the book will be available at the <indig> Talakayan
</indig> on <mention> <indig> &ldquo; Asukal Para Sa Mahirap, Sa Presyo

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#43:2>
If this sounds <mention> &ldquo; Greek &rdquo; </mention> to you,
no need to fret - - you are one of millions of Filipinos who are slowly being
poisoned by the bread we eat.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#44:2>
According to one concerned citizen, Donnie Lopez, of Diliman, Quezon
City, <quote> &ldquo; this toxic chemical has been mixed with our flour since
1900 when we started using wheat flour in our country and has now grown into
a multi-million peso industry. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#45:2>
Lopez adds that a warning had been issued by the Food and
Agriculture Organization ( FAO) and World Health Organization ( WHO) <quote>
&ldquo; that this chemical can cause cancer. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#46:2>
Lopez pressed for a ban on the toxic additive to be imposed by
the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) and had written to Dr. Quintin
Kintanar, director of the Bureau of Food and Drugs ( BFAD), regarding the
matter. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#47:2>
Dr. Kintanar informed Lopez of Administrative Order No. 25 issued
in 1996 <mention> &ldquo; Setting the deadline for the Phase-Out of Potassium
Bromate as Flour Treatment Agent to End September 30, 1996. &rdquo;
</mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#48:2>
Alas, an error delayed implementation of the &ldquo; phase-out.
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#49:2>
Contrary to regulations under the Consumers Act, Administrative
Order No. 25 was published in only one newspaper of general circulation
instead of the prescribed two newspapers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#50:2>
For some inexplicable reason, it took Director Kintanar almost
two years to correct the &ldquo; error &rdquo; and have AO No. 25 published
in two newspapers only last April 1998.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#51:2>
The consequence of the delay was that potassium bromate continued to
be used as an additive agent in flour for baking bread. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#52:2>
According to Lopez who describes himself as a <mention> &ldquo;
lone crusader on the ban on potassium bromate, &rdquo; </mention> Kintanar 's
directive continues to be ignored. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#53:2>
Again, upon the urging of Lopez, then Health Secretary Felipe
Estrella issued on July 31, 1998, Department Circular No. 55 for the
continued ban of the toxic chemical.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#54:2>
Estrella blamed non-compliance on Kintanar 's failure <quote> &ldquo;
to launch an unscheduled inspection of those companies given a &ldquo; CDO
&rdquo; ( cease and desist order) and cancel of their permit to operate if
proven that anyone of them have violated the ban for the 2nd time around.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#55:2>
Lopez cites Kintanar for insisting to media that potassium
bromate can be considered safe for the millions of people involved in
processing this toxic chemical, are directly inhaling the powder and the
possibility of developing cancer is of great risk. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#56:2>
Fortunately, Lopez found a sympathetic ear in Senator Juan M.
Flavier who filed Resolution No. 118 on August 13, 1998, calling for a senate
investigation <quote> &ldquo; to determine the reason why the DOH failed in
totally stopping the use of potassium bromate. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#57:2>
Senator Flavier, who was health secretary during the Ramos
administration, underscores the fact that the ban should have been in force
for almost five years now since the DOH had banned the said products in the
Philippines in 1994. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#58:2>
Perhaps Director Kintanar shall enlighten the senate committee on
health on <quote> &ldquo; the reason why the DOH failed in totally stopping
the use of potassium bromate. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#59:2>
The consuming public has a right to know and to be protected.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#60:2>
Even if one didn't eat bread, we are exposed to all sorts of
carcinogenic agents - - from the air we breathe, the water we drink, the
bombardment of ultra-violet rays of the sun, even the pouring &ldquo; acid
rain, &rdquo; the <foreign> e. coli </foreign> in fresh meats and fish, the
fruits and vegetables fattened under clouds of insecticides, pesticides, etc.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#61:2>
We shouldn't have to worry also about the bread we eat. </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#64:2>
SOMEONE once said that human beings are just <quote> &ldquo;
hairy bags of water that can move. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#65:2>
Quite true since the body is anywhere from 50 to 70 percent water.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#66:2>
The average person can be composed of 10 to 12 gallons!

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#67:2>
Muscle is 76 percent water, the brain is 75 percent, blood is 83
percent and even bone is 22 percent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#68:2>
In general, men have more water per pound than women do because
they have a greater muscle mass and less fat mass ( fat cells have very
little water). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#69:2>
Water is actually the most important nutrient.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#70:2>
A person can live for many days without food or can live for an
extensive period with food that is lacking in vitamins and minerals but will
only last about three days without water. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#71:2>
The average adult needs two to three quarts of water per day.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#72:2>
Roughly, this same amount is lost through sweating, urination,
defecation and respiration. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#73:2>
<h> <bold> How much water do you need to drink daily </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#74:2>
According to the <mention> UC Berkeley Wellness Letter,
</mention> you need to consume, on the average, the <it> equivalent </it> of
two quarts or eight glasses of water.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#75:2>
Remember that you need more if you live in a very hot or very cold
climate, if you are physically active or if you have a fever. </p>

<quote> &ldquo; Not all of this fluid needs to be plain water.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#X77:2>
Milk and other beverages consist almost entirely of water. &rdquo;
</quote> </X>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#78:2>
Much of the food we eat also contributes to our daily fluid needs.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#79:2>
Most fruits are more than 80 percent water according to <mention>
&ldquo; the Tufts University Guide to Total Nutrition. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#80:2>
Even foods you don't think contain much water also contribute to your
fluid intake.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#81:2>
For example, cooked lean beef is 65 percent water, bread is about 35
percent and butter is 15 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#82:2>
Soups are another good source of fluid. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#83:2>
Most people drink about one to one-and-a-half quarts of water per
day and get an additional quart from the food they eat.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#84:2>
If you don't get enough fluid, you can become constipated, develop
kidney stones and increase your risk of urinary tract infections.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#85:2>
Many chronically constipated people do not drink enough water and do
not eat enough fiber-rich foods ( fruits, vegetables and grains). </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#86:2>
<h> <bold> Distilled water may not be so good for you </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#87:2>
A reader from Cebu sent me a press release from the United States
Environmental Protection Agency that stated: <quote> &ldquo; Distilled water,
being essentially mineral-free, is very aggressive, in that it tends to
dissolve substances with which it is in contact. <X>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#X88:2>
Notably carbon dioxide from the air is rapidly absorbed, making the
water acidic and even more aggressive.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#X89:2>
Many metals are dissolved by distilled water.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#X90:2>
Because of the absence of minerals, distilled water is not an ideal
beverage.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#X91:2>
It has been described as tasteless, flat or sometimes bitter.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#X92:2>
The traces of metals frequently found in distilled water may impart
a metallic taste.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#X93:2>
While distilled water may be prescribed by physicians for those
required to severely restrict their sodium intake, the prolonged consumption
of distilled water may have adverse health implications.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#X94:2>
There appears to be a correlation between the consumption of soft
water ( distilled water is extremely soft) and the incidence of
cardiovascular disease. &rdquo; </quote> </X> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#95:2>
<h> <bold> Caffeinated drinks not as dehydrating as once thought
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#96:2>
Caffeine is a diuretic--it makes you go to the bathroom more
often.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#97:2>
This has led to the mistaken belief that for every one cup of coffee
you drink, you can lose as much as two cups of fluid in your urine.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#98:2>
According to the <mention> Tufts University Health and Nutrition
Letter, </mention> this is not true.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#99:2>
They interviewed several experts in the field who all confirmed that
you lose only 50 percent of the liquid in a cup of coffee.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#100:2>
In other words, if you drink 8 oz of coffee, after a couple of
hours, you will lose 4 oz.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#101:2>
Still you will have a net gain of 4 oz of fluid.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#102:2>
Dr. Robert Murray of the Gatorade Sports Science Institute, one of
the experts interviewed, said that even if you drink just plain water, you
will lose 35 percent of it a few hours later.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#103:2>
That 's why you need to drink water every day.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#104:2>
Take note though that the experts are not advocating coffee or
caffeinated soft drinks as a good alternative to drinking water.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-028#105:2>
They are just saying that the dehydrating effects of caffeine are
exaggerated. </p> </I>
