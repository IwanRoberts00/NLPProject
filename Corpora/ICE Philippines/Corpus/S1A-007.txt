<I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#1:1:A>
And then were you here

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#2:1:B>
Yeah I was in school <indig> na </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#3:1:B>
I was in class and then uhm our teacher was lecturing and all of a sudden she started kinda swaying
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#4:1:B>
She felt <{> <[> dizzy </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#5:1:A>
<[> <unclear> word </unclear> before </[> </{> or

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#6:1:B>
She thought that she felt dizzy and then she asked us did did you feel that 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#7:1:B>
More or like we we kinda realized it after she asked us <indig> e </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#8:1:B>
And it was like it lasted for about a minute 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#9:1:A>
A <{> <[> minute </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#10:1:B>
A <[> minute </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#11:1:B>
It was really long but it it it wasn't really that strong <indig> e </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#12:1:B>
It was kinda you know when you 're kinda drunk <{> <[> and </[> and you can't get your footing right

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#13:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#14:1:A>
Uh uhm uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#15:1:B>
So you kinda sway
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#16:1:B>
That 's how it felt but we were sitting down then and also it felt like somebody was shaking your chair your desk

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#17:1:A>
What time was this because I didn't go to school so I didn't feel it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#18:1:A>
I didn't feel it in Para&ntilde;aque 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#19:1:B>
Uhm I think it was around nine thirty to ten something like early in the morning

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#20:1:A>
Early

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#21:1:B>
Yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#22:1:A>
And then what happened
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#23:1:A>
Did anybody panic or <{> <[> whatever </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#24:1:B>
<[> No </[> </{> nothing
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#25:1:B>
She was she our teacher just said <indig> na </indig> uhm it 's about time 'cause it hit like I don't know Japan or Korea twice already so it was a <{> <[> matter of time </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#27:1:A>
<[> I think it was </[> </{> Japan

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#28:1:B>
Japan right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#29:1:B>
So she was like why be surprised 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#30:1:B>
It 's a you know it 's

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#31:1:A>
<{> <[> It 's a natural </[> phenomenon

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#32:1:B>
<[> It 's inevitable </[> </{> because it 's hitting everything around us
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#33:1:B>
Why won't it hit us <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#34:1:B>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#62:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#63:1:B>
There <indig> kasi </indig> in <indig> ano </indig> we were in uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#64:1:A>
Makati

 <$B>

Glorietta

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#68:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#69:1:B>
Where that party was 'cause of that Gatecrasher came here right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#70:1:B>
So there was a big party a D J party <,> so <indig> ang daming tao </indig> and then all I thought we were staying by like a few steps by the D J 's booth and what separated the D J 's booth from the dance floor was like a ledge right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#71:1:B>
And it was like maybe a foot wide and I saw <indig> kasi </indig> people uhm would put their glasses and their bottles on top of the ledge so what I did was I was going down the steps
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#72:1:B>
It was like <indig> mga </indig> around two three feet away and right when I reached my hand up 'cause I wanna push back the bottles and the glasses 'cause people kept on bumping into the ledge I was gonna push them back and all of a sudden before you know nobody hit the ledge but the bottles kinda tipped over right into it fell into my hand
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#74:1:B>
So and that 's when I felt swaying like really <indig> lakas </indig> really strong
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#75:1:B>
I swayed back and forth
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#76:1:B>
Even the D J was like what the hell is going on 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#77:1:B>
Everybody was swaying 

 <$A> 


<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#> Some of my friends thought it was the effects of the place of the club
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#78:1:A>
Yeah <.> be </.> because everybody was high everybody was on whatever 

 <$B> 


<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#> And there were like laser shows <{> <[> and all </[> of that

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#80:1:A>
<[> Uh uhm </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#81:1:B>
And people it was it was it was as strong as it was like the tide that you could get knocked off your feet <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> if you were like uh unsteady or something
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#84:1:B>
It 's really strong I had to I had to hold on to my friend
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#85:1:B>
We were hugging each other 'cause it it was like <indig> ang lakas grabe </indig> <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#86:1:B>
So there and the thing is you know after that right after it happened <,> uhm my boy friend and I was let 's go let 's get out of here because aftershocks <indig> daw </indig> are <{2> <[2> strong </[2> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#82:1:A>
<[1> Uh uhm </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#87:1:A>
<[2> Are worse </[2> </{2> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#88:1:B>
Are worse so you we had to get out of the building
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#89:1:B>
We couldn't take the elevator because we know it 's stupid
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#90:1:B>
So we went to the parking lot and uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#91:1:A>
Took the stairs

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#92:1:B>
And took the stairs and a lot of people were going out but the thing is like maybe half of the people were still stayed in there
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#93:1:B>
They were still partying and the D J just kept on going
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#94:1:B>
He 's like what am I gonna to continue or and everybody was cheering and okay we 'll continue 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#95:1:B>
They started playing and then everybody was there shouting you know <,> it was kinda

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#96:1:A>
Stupid

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#97:1:B>
Stupid because you know <indig> di ba </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#98:1:A>
People don't realize that things like that happen for a reason
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#99:1:A>
It 's not just

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#100:1:B>
Yeah exactly and they didn't kinda piece it together that you know earthquakes have been happening in first in Turkey and I don't know where else but it was <indig> sunod-sunod </indig> right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#101:1:B>
It was right one after

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#102:1:A>
Signs in signs of the coming of the end of the world

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#103:1:B>
I know it said in the Bible and these people aren't even scared I mean <indig> di ba </indig> I was telling you before <,> it was like the perfect setting for it to happen
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#104:1:B>
I wasn't even surprised that it happened because you 're here amidst all these people who are high on something or drunk or whatever and it 's kinda like that image when uhm <,> uh when when people are

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#105:1:A>
<indig> Parang </indig> they turned in salt <,> from the Bible <,> what was that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#106:1:B>
No the one where they were uhm they were like worshipping that golden cow or something that they have made

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#107:1:A>
Uh yeah yeah yeah and when you look back the the person who looks back will turn into salt

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#108:1:B>
Uh that 's the one

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#109:1:A>
Uh uhm that 's it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#110:1:B>
Okay so it was kinda like that I I kinda <.> re </.> <indig> parang </indig> I pictured in my head <indig> na </indig> this is the scene from the Bible only we 're not by a mountain we 're in a party and these people are worshipping the wrong thing

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#111:1:A>
<{> <[> I know </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#112:1:B>
<[> They 're </[> </{> enjoying the wrong thing worshipping their drugs their fun their hedonistic whatever
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#113:1:B>
And it was like that earthquake was kinda like the Lord 's voice from above
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#114:1:B>
Remember when <indig> di ba </indig> in the Bible it says uhm there 's a loud voice from above or something like that

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#115:1:A>
Uh uhm <,> that was so that was so scary
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#116:1:A>
I was so scared and

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#117:1:B>
What did you do

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#118:1:A>
Uhm when I woke up I wasn't even sure because I was I was sitting on the bed and I was I was just sitting there for the longest time waiting for it to stop because it because I couldn't move and I was I felt so dizzy and then after it like after like I looked outside and looked if everything was fine if

<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#149:1:B>
I guess there were some important persons there

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#150:1:A>
<indig> Grabe 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#151:1:A>
The signs are everywhere but then

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#152:1:B>
I know

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#153:1:A>
Everybody just goes on with their lives and not thinking of what may happen in the future

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#154:1:B>
It 's more of like they 're brushing it aside <{> <[> they don't </[> they don't <indig> di ba </indig> they don't wanna deal with it

They don't wanna feel scared

 <$A>

Sometimes when I tell my friend when I tell them like I feel like it 's going to be the end of the world soon they 're like can you not talk like that 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#159:1:B>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#162:1:B>
But they don't wanna face it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#163:1:B>
They wanna go on and do whatever they 've been doing
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#164:1:B>
They don't want the reality of God 's power to to kinda rain on their parade kinda thing
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#165:1:B>
They wanna enjoy they wanna do what they want
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-007#166:1:B>
They don't wanna have to uhm you know <&> speaker A says something but unclear </&>
