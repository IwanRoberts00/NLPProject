 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#4:1:B>
I watched it but I didn't see that part because I was covering my eyes

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#5:1:C>
I actually cried because of that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#6:1:B>
Which part

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#7:1:C>
The the girl who suddenly

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#8:1:A>
Popped out

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#9:1:C>
Popped out you know where I just vomit

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#10:1:A>
According to my sister the the scariest part of the movie was like in the beginning when the little boy entered the kitchen and there 's this there was this lady opening the cabinet and then when the lady faced him she was bloody 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#11:1:A>
<.> Fo </.> for my sister that was the scariest part
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#12:1:A>
She wasn't able to sleep for like three nights alone

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#13:1:C>
Isn't it that <unclear> words </unclear> at the box office

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#14:1:B>
Yeah me and my for me the scariest part would when the when the guy was walking down the corridor and then he said uh sooner or later I 'll put you to death and when he turned he had a hole in his head so that 's sick <,,> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#15:1:C>
So sick



<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#> Anyway another question
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#16:1:C>
Are you taking your practicum Denise

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#17:1:A>
Uhm yes I am

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#18:1:C>
Oh where are you taking it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#19:1:A>
I 'm taking it at Hong Kong Bank it 's at Ayala Avenue
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#20:1:A>
They just moved in they have a new building
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#21:1:A>
It 's quite good I mean it 's interesting 'cause it 's like a new building and then everyone who works there uhm is given an I D with those bar I mean with the bar code in it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#22:1:A>
Then uhm these people can go anywhere and practically anywhere like if if they can they can access like different offices just through that bar code in their I Ds

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#23:1:C>
What do you do there

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#24:1:A>
Uhm I was assigned to work at the Administration Department
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#25:1:A>
Uhm I I 'm like I 'm like the secretary of the manager of that department
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#26:1:A>
He gives me like he gives me work every day he 's the one responsible for me
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#27:1:A>
Uhm I submit I mean he 's the one who checks my time I mean if I have completed my eight hours of work
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#28:1:A>
And then basically what I do there is like tally the reimbursement forms submitted to him by the officers of the bank
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#29:1:A>
Yeah and then the manager who I work for has this box and that box every day mail comes in and at practically any time
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#30:1:A>
Uhm and then what I do is that I sort out the mails inside the box uhm some would be like uhm purchase orders statement of account <.> etcet </.> you know office box
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#31:1:A>
You where do you plan to work

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#32:1:C>
Actually I 'm just going to take my practicum next term so <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#33:1:C>
Candice aren't you supposed to take your practicum next term also

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#34:1:B>
Yeah I just came in June
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#35:1:B>
Denise but the thing you work in it 's called <mention> The Enterprise </mention> right

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#36:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#37:1:B>
It 's a nice building
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#38:1:B>
They have a nice canteen there

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#39:1:A>
Yeah but then what 's hard about their canteen is that it really gets really full during lunch hour
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#40:1:A>
That 's really it will take you like fifteen minutes to get a place so it 's nice but you know it 's a hassle eating there

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#41:1:C>
How about the food

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#42:1:A>
The food is okay quite expensive 'cause a meal would cost like a hundred fifty bucks <.> depend </.> considering that I don't get paid <,> uhm my allowance my allowance is uhm <,,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#43:1:B>
Who do you eat with

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#44:1:A>
What

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#45:1:B>
Who do you eat with

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#46:1:A>
Uhm I eat with my colleagues in the office
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#47:1:A>
I mean they 're they 're old people I mean like their ages range from late thirties
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#48:1:A>
No not <indig> naman </indig> late late thirties up until early forties

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#49:1:B>
Oh so is there anyone <unclear> words </unclear> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#50:1:A>
Unfortunately there 's none
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#51:1:A>
It 's it could really get frustrating 'cause like you have no one to talk to I mean someone you could talk to the same I mean I mean someone you could converse with 'cause like basically most of them have their own family and they 're like daddies already
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#52:1:A>
So there 's really not much there 's really not much to talk about with them <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#53:1:B>
So what do you plan to do after you graduate

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#54:1:A>
Uhm <,> I haven't really thought about that clearly but right after I graduate I 'm planning to visit my <indig> lola </indig> in Bacolod
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#55:1:A>
There 'cause there 'cause my Mom <,> 'cause my Mom is from Bacolod so they <?> stay </?> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#56:1:A>
All their relatives are still there but <unclear> too many of </unclear> my cousins left
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#57:1:A>
How about you Candice I 've heard that you like Bacolod so much

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#58:1:B>
Yeah I love Bacolod
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#59:1:B>
It 's such a nice town
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#60:1:B>
All the people are so nice

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#61:1:A>
Yeah I know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#62:1:A>
How about the food

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#63:1:B>
The food is good like the Chicken Bacolod

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#64:1:A>
Oh the <indig> inasal </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#65:1:B>
Yeah that one

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#66:1:A>
How about you Kay have you been to Bacolod

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#67:1:C>
Of course I 've been there 'cause would you believe I come from Iloilo so it 's just a neighboring town
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#68:1:C>
So if I have the time if my family like and I have the time to go there but then we usually stay in Iloilo

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#69:1:A>
I 've been to Iloilo like three years ago
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#70:1:A>
It was really fun 'cause I was with my class and <.> Baco </.> uh during during that time I was still studying at Bacolod and then our teacher our History teacher gave uhm we had a we had to go to a field trip in Iloilo and it was really fun
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#71:1:A>
We went to malls and went to historical sites in Iloilo

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#72:1:C>
Actually for me there 's not much to do in Iloilo
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#73:1:C>
But in Bacolod I think there 's a lot of night uh clubs night life is so good there compared to Iloilo
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#74:1:C>
Hey guys would you like to go to Davao I mean particularly in Pearl Farm

 <$B>

Yeah it 's a resort
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#83:1:C>
Before it was a pearl plantation <unclear> words </unclear> uh I mean before they opened it to the public they opened it to members only <,> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#84:1:A>
So for you to be able to go there you have to be a member so you have to pay <{> <[> a membership fee </[>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-012#85:1:C>
<[> Now you don't </[> </{> now you don't have to do that just go there uhm <unclear> words </unclear> when you get to farmer 's place <unclear> words </unclear>
