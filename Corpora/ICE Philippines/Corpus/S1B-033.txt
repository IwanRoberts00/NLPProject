<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#1:1:A>
<&> start of sentence not taped </&> four thirty-three point seventy-two five twenty twenty point sixty-eight percent six thirty-eight point seven two seven thirty-three point twenty-three
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#2:1:A>
The major determinant of social stratification is income
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#3:1:A>
Because of the difficulty in obtaining these data other factors such as size of house kind and number of appliances the household has were considered
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#4:1:A>
Now in terms of income <indig> ano ba 'yung </indig> A B
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#5:1:A>
Well the A B are those with over one hundred thousand per year the salary C those uh who have sixty thousand to one hundred thousand pesos uh as income per year and D below sixty thousand pesos
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#6:1:A>
Other factors mentioned were used <.> subject </.> subjectively intensifying the borderline classes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#7:1:A>
Based on the nineteen eighty-eight family income and expenditures survey the criteria mentioned earlier classifies sixty-four point seventy-one percent of households as class D E twenty point forty-four percent as class C and fourteen point eighty-five percent as class A B
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#8:1:A>
In Metro Manila alone fifty-one point twenty-four percent were classified as class D E twenty-seven point thirty-four percent as class C and twenty-one point thirty-two percent as class A B
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#9:1:A>
The <indig> barangays </indig> were stratified according to the dominant class of the residents
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#10:1:A>
A class A B <indig> barangay </indig> is dominated by A B residents
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#11:1:A>
A class D E <indig> barangay </indig> is dominated by D E residents
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#12:1:A>
A class C <indig> barangay </indig> on the other hand is not necessarily dominated by class C residents rather we see a mixture of A B C and D E residents
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#13:1:A>
The survey includes fifteen <indig> barangays </indig> allocated equally to the three socio-economic groups
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#14:1:A>
Only one voting center will be enumerated in each sample <indig> barangay </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#15:1:A>
From the chosen voting center thirty percent of the precincts will be taken as a representative
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#16:1:A>
The chosen <indig> barangays </indig> for the respective classes are as follows
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#17:1:A>
Class A B one <indig> barangay </indig> each from Makati Las Pi&ntilde;as Quezon City San Juan Marikina as you can see
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#18:1:A>
For class C one <indig> barangay </indig> each from Marikina Pasig Manila Muntinlupa Quezon City
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#19:1:A>
For class D E one <indig> barangay </indig> each from Para&ntilde;aque Quezon City Muntinlupa Manila and Marikina
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#20:1:A>
We have fielded twenty-one volunteers to cover the designated areas
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#21:1:A>
We 're expecting that approximately thirty percent of the votes will be canvassed by nine o'clock this evening
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#22:1:A>
Our volunteers will take uh note of the partial and unofficial returns and by nine o'clock or ten o'clock this evening we will have that report for you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#23:1:A>
Uh we would like to emphasize that we are not trending
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#24:1:A>
We are not projecting
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#25:1:A>
We 're just sampling on how the different uh socio-economic classes in these defined areas have voted are voting and later on as the M C Q C count comes in because the M C Q C count will come in tomorrow yet at around four o'clock or two o'clock in the afternoon
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#26:1:A>
So in between what you will have would be the reportage from our R P N network 's uh volunteers our own reporters C N N Allied and so on and so forth
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#27:1:A>
But we will be giving you this network demographic count which is highlight of <mention> Pollwatch ninety-two </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#28:1:A>
We have the man on top of this uh project Dr Arniel Barrios
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#29:1:A>
Uh <indig> siguro </indig> that was a mouthful I said <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#30:1:A>
It is your project so uh are the volunteers out already in their respective areas

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#31:1:B>
Uh they 're still here and uh after this I 'm supposed to brief them and uh their they 'll go to their respective assignments

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#32:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#33:1:B>
And by three o'clock this afternoon uh we 're going to decide uh how many how many precincts they are going to consider for each uh voting center
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#34:1:B>
And then we have to they will uh relax there wait after the uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#35:1:A>
Closing

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#36:1:B>
A certain
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#37:1:B>
Yeah closing 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#38:1:B>
And after a certain number of uh votes have been counted uh they will uh have the partial tabulation

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#39:1:A>
Are we having the Civic Action Group to <{> <[> uh </[> utilize

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#40:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#41:1:B>
They have uhm uh installed their station there

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#42:1:A>
Alright

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#43:1:B>
And uh they 're supposed to be the one who will transmit the uh partial returns 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#44:1:B>
And uh tomorrow for the uh final tabulation we will also assist our volunteers to uh bring the uh questionnaires here in the studio

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#45:1:A>
So uh we can be assured a very fast transmission of <{> <[> results </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#46:1:B>
<[> Right </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#47:1:A>
Because we have the C A G the Civic Action Group backing it up
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#48:1:A>
They are mobile and they are equipped with the V H F facilities
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#49:1:A>
Gaby are we talking Greek or

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#50:1:C>
Well no it is just that it is very interesting uh how the whole concept about this demographic count is very interesting to me
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#51:1:C>
And I 'm at at this point I 'm wondering how the demographic count results will fare as far as the official results are going to come out

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#52:1:A>
Well official you 'll refer to the COMELEC

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#53:1:C>
To the COMELEC

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#54:1:A>
The COMELEC tabulation <{> <[> is </[> the official not even M C Q C

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#55:1:C>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#56:1:A>
But that the point you 're asking is whether our sampling will match eventually with the unofficial or even the official

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#57:1:B>
Well uh as what Mr Pedroche has mentioned a while ago we are going to take samples in Metro Manila only

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#58:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#59:1:B>
It means that uh whatever result we are going to obtain this may apply only in Metro Manila okay

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#60:1:C>
At this point uh excuse me
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#61:1:C>
At this point do you have any uhm propositions
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#62:1:C>
Do you have any premises as of now as to for example how the A and B the C the D and the E are going to vote

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#63:1:B>
Not yet

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#64:1:A>
That is what we 're going to look for

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#65:1:B>
Yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#66:1:A>
Uh and then let 's say in Forbes Park for example uh that 's an A mostly A and upper B area
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#67:1:A>
Uh we will know by around ten o'clock uh how an A area for example Forbes Park uh voted <indig> 'no </indig> voted President Vice-President and the senatorial candidates <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#68:1:A>
And then compare it with the other uh A B groups uh in in Metro Manila
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#69:1:A>
And later on as we get results from the provinces the different city centers urban centers there and match <indig> 'no </indig> whether there is really uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#70:1:B>
Later on we will find out if uh our survey have obtained a representative of how the uh voting population voted
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#71:1:B>
But the main objective of this of the uh survey is mainly to know how the different socio-economic classes voted here in Metro Manila

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#72:1:A>
Okay I hope it 's clear
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#73:1:A>
It 's not to pre-empt M C Q C

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#74:1:B>
Right

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#75:1:A>
It 's not to establish a trend
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#76:1:A>
It is not uh as if it is an official count
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#77:1:A>
It is an unofficial count 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#78:1:A>
And it has to be emphasized that uh this is just a sampling taken from the entire universe of uh the electorate okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#79:1:A>
So watch that and that 's going to be one of the highlights of <mention> Pollwatch ninety-two </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#80:1:A>
What do we have next
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#81:1:A>
Okay Arniel is there anything more you would like to say before uh we let you go
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#82:1:A>
I know you have to go to your uh post to talk to your volunteers

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#83:1:B>
Yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#84:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#85:1:B>
Have some briefing

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#86:1:A>
No problems with the I D <indig> ha </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#87:1:A>
No more problems
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#88:1:A>
Okay

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#89:1:B>
Okay again I would like to uh clarify to the televiewers that this is just a survey and we have taken uh five precincts from what we think are the class A B five precincts no sorry five voting centers five voting centers from what we think are class C and five uh voting centers from what we think are class D E in Metro Manila only okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#90:1:B>
And uh as we know Metro Manila is an urbanized area uh but this does not necessarily mean that all other urban uh centers voted same as what has happened here in Metro <.> Mani </.> as what was going to happen here in Metro Manila

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#91:1:A>
Okay uh Gaby isn't that interesting <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#92:1:A>
Won't you want to know how the people in Tondo let 's say an E area

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#93:1:C>
That 's why I asked Dr Barrios earlier if they have certain propositions that they merely want to validate because I suppose uh we all know that there are some candidates like in the presidentiables and vice-presidentiables who would definitely be you know a mass mass who would have mass appeal and are they
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#94:1:C>
I was wondering earlier whether the demographic count would seek to validate certain <{> <[> propositions </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#95:1:A>
<[> Well maybe </[> </{> that that is not although that is not the main objective it might in a way incidentally validate that without meaning to but uh if it does validate then that 's alright isn't it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#96:1:B>
Actually based on this uh late recent uh uh days there are some uh articles in <mention> Inquirer </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#97:1:B>
They 're trying to uh <.> co </.> uh construct some theories on how uh the voting population are going to vote

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#98:1:A>
Is that so

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#99:1:B>
And I I think uh there 's an article there on uh uh according to them they 're going to vote according to the socio-economic classes and but they have not mentioned uh who are the preferences of each classes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#100:1:A>
Uh other uh classifications aside from uh socio-economic could be the different sectors <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#101:1:A>
For example answer this for me Dr Barrios is there uh a religious vote with I 'm talking about <indig> Iglesia </indig> vote Catholic vote
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#102:1:A>
Is there a youth vote
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#103:1:A>
Is there a <w> farmers' </w> vote
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#104:1:A>
Is there an A B vote and so on and so forth huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#105:1:B>
I don't really <{> <[> know </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#106:1:A>
<[> Okay </[> </{> let 's confine to the youth vote and the <w> farmers' </w> vote <indig> 'no </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#107:1:B>
I think

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#108:1:A>
Because it 's <.> dan </.> dangerous to tread on the religious vote

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#109:1:B>
Uh in my personal opinion I think there is such a thing as the <indig> Iglesia </indig> vote

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#110:1:A>
Okay

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#111:1:B>
But when it comes to youth I don't I 'm I 'm not really sure if there is such a thing as youth vote

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#112:1:A>
Yeah <mention> youth </mention> means that uh they are thirty-five uh years of age and below and they comprise one half of the thirty-two point <{> <[> something <[> million uh voters

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#113:1:B>
<[> Right </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#114:1:B>
Well if there is such a thing as a youth vote whoever that uh candidate is uh he or she will be assured of about fifty-six percent of the voting population

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#115:1:A>
Uh-huh will the youth if there 's a youth vote vote solidly for

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#116:1:B>
If there 's such a thing

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#117:1:A>
If there 's such a thing

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#118:1:B>
Yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#119:1:A>
There 's another uh group which uh I 'm looking for an answer to as to whether there is a <w> farmers' </w> vote because there are millions of them
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#120:1:A>
There are about uhm seventy members of a household belonging to a <w> farmers' </w> or an agricultural of sort group
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#121:1:A>
Imagine that seventy did I say about that <indig> 'no </indig> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#122:1:C>
Well I think there are efforts right now among the <w> farmers' </w> groups to consolidate themselves and come up with a some form of a <w> farmers' </w> vote although I think they themselves agree that uh as of now there is no definite <w> farmers' </w> vote
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#123:1:C>
But I think it is the process of constructing or making one I think which is what they find in this year 's election

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#124:1:A>
Okay I I you 're right there
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#125:1:A>
Uh we 'll go back to this discussion
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#126:1:A>
Uh we have uh in readiness now a report from uh Cagayan de Oro D X K O
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#127:1:A>
Come in Cagayan de Oro <&> a two-minute report by Art Cuaresma </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#128:1:A>
Thank you very much Atty Art Cuaresma D X K O Cagayan de Oro
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#129:1:A>
Now back to the different sectors and their votes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#130:1:A>
We asked earlier if there 's a <w> farmers' </w> vote the youth vote and uh Dr Barrios was saying it seems that there 's a youth vote but he was not very definite about it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#131:1:A>
But uh would you want to repeat what you said if there 's a youth vote 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#132:1:B>
Yeah uh if there 's such a thing as youth vote uh that whoever that candidate is favored by uh this sector uh he or she will be assured about fifty-six percent of the uh votes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#133:1:A>
But then I I dare say that uh not all of that will go to one particular candidate because the youth vote I think is also further divided into

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#134:1:B>
Yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#135:1:A>
More <{> <[> than one </[> candidate

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-033#136:1:B>
<[> Exactly </[> </{> 

 </I>
