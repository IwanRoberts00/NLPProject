But you know Vic Vic I love this weather

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#20:1:A>
You like this weather

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#21:1:B>
I like this weather
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#22:1:B>
It 's not hot
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#23:1:B>
And but I wish there were <,> there were something in the morning I could take so my my muscles would not ache so much
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#24:1:B>
That 's old age of course <indig> 'no </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#25:1:A>
And what about I was listening to the closing remarks of A D A at <mention> Broadcasters Bureau </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#26:1:A>
And she said happy weekend 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#27:1:A>
It 's it 's only Thursday A D A

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#28:1:B>
For for some people it 's already weekend uh Vic

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#29:1:A>
Yes it 's <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#30:1:A>
Is it <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#31:1:A>
Anyway folks uh environment-wise Emily what attracted my attention this morning was still uh these friends of ours across the wall

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#32:1:B>
The D E N R people

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#33:1:A>
The D E N R people

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#34:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#35:1:A>
Uh there is still the story about the nurses and the dentists uh appointed to take care of <{> <[> of the Pasig River </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#36:1:B>
<[> There 's only one explanation for that Vic </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#37:1:A>
Uh it looks like uh <,> the there are some people who have been feeding uh news bits

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#38:1:B>
This is media frenzy now hey

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#39:1:A>
To the reporters that not only are they are these supposedly uh these these appointees are supposedly not qualified I mean you know they 're dentists
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#40:1:A>
What what are they doing for in a Pasig River movement

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#41:1:B>
Hey dentists pull out something you know and they 're gonna pull out the debris
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#42:1:B>
He he he <&> =sarcastic laughter </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#43:1:B>
You know

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#44:1:A>
Uh and uh the issue now is that all of these appointees have been uh uh given uh <.> ov </.> not I mean residences or they 've converted official cottages into residences right at the Parks and Wildlife Bureau

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#45:1:B>
Really

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#46:1:A>
area area just near where we are

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#47:1:B>
And what is that supposed to be
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#48:1:B>
I mean what are what is the purpose of those the <{> <[> cottages </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#49:1:A>
<[> There </[> </{> there are cottages there that are used for official functions

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#50:1:B>
Just official and not for uh lodging

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#51:1:A>
Not for residence

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#52:1:B>
Oh okay

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#53:1:A>
Uh it 's supposed to be sometimes

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#54:1:B>
And how many of those

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#55:1:A>
A halfway house

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#56:1:B>
Supposed to be

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#57:1:A>
For provincial officials

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#58:1:B>
Uh okay

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#59:1:A>
Staying in Manila

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#60:1:B>
Well it 's been it 's been functioning as a hotel also uh apparently

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#61:1:A>
Uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#62:1:B>
Occasionally

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#63:1:A>
As overnight accommodations for for <{> <[> official purposes </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#64:1:B>
<[> So how many people </[> </{> are staying there now

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#65:1:A>
Uh no exact count but uh this batch appointed by the D E N R Secretary uh is over twenty
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#66:1:A>
So that 's about two dozen people
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#67:1:A>
And uh what is what I find significant is that for two days now this has been appearing in media in print in broadcast and there has been no reaction from the Office of the Secretary
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#68:1:A>
For one we know that Secretary Cerilles is in the Netherlands oh <{> <[> signing signing </[> a document uh on behalf of the Philippine government

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#69:1:B>
<[> No wonder no wonder </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#70:1:B>
Oh well that explains it

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#71:1:C>
But the public affairs people have no reaction either

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#72:1:B>
Because it was the Secretary apparently who uh appointed these people so what can they say

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#73:1:A>
And so they have to they have to wait for the Secretary

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#74:1:B>
Of course

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#75:1:A>
To come back
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#76:1:A>
Although some other officials are are issuing justifications that uh these these appointments are uh there 's nothing illegal about the appointments
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#77:1:A>
They are contractual and so on and so forth
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#78:1:A>
But I I sense that uh there is a group within the bureaucracy within the old-timers possibly who are who might be jealous because maybe the salaries are bigger or whatever

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#79:1:B>
There 's only one explanation as I said
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#80:1:B>
These people probably need jobs

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#81:1:A>
We need uh a reaction from the Secretary we 'll try to get that when he comes back
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#82:1:A>
In the interest of you know good journalism we get the other side when we can

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#83:1:B>
Of course <O> music </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#84:1:A>
Of course we 'd like to remind you you are tuned in to D W B R one o four point three
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#85:1:A>

We still haven't heard from Fe Hidalgo
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#96:1:A>
She 's probably very busy now with her new responsibilities at the Department of Education Culture and Sports if my recollection is correct about an item I read in the newspapers about Fe Hidalgo being appointed to some important position in the department which I 'm sure she deserves
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#97:1:A>
A great lady like like Fe Hidalgo
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#98:1:A>
Emily I was telling you while we were playing that musical <mention> Bee is a Bug </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#99:1:A>
Uh I 've been thinking a lot about Howie Severino 's piece that I saw in the <mention> Probe Team </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#100:1:A>
This feature on <foreign> muro ami </foreign> in uh Palawan

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#111:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#112:1:A>
We can discuss <foreign> muro ami </foreign> uh on another uh plane
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#113:1:A>
But right now I 'm I 'm thinking more of uh this uh in terms of from from the journalistic point of view

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#114:1:B>
As a backgrounder Howie Severino was interviewed by us yesterday <{> <[> yesterday morning </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#115:1:A>
<[> Yesterday morning </[> </{> uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#116:1:B>
Regarding his uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#117:1:A>
The segment that he produced for the <mention> Probe uh Team </mention> <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#118:1:A>
And uh the way how he put it he went to Northern Palawan in search of <foreign> muro ami </foreign> because there were they got tips that <foreign> muro ami </foreign> a banned fishing method was still being used by certain influential businessmen in in that area
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#119:1:A>
And uh it turns out as how he himself said <,> they went there pretending to be scuba diving tourists
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#120:1:A>
And uh the question that came to my mind is is a journalist obligated to tell uh someone he is interviewing that he may be using this for a television broadcast 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#121:1:B>
That 's the <{> <[> American way </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#122:1:A>
<[> What what </[> </{> do you think

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#123:1:B>
That 's the American way
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#124:1:B>
I don't think that is uh uh practiced in the Philippines <,> because otherwise they will they will clam up you know these interviewees will uh clam up

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#125:1:A>
And so

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#126:1:B>
And so you have to use pretences or you have to pretend that you are somebody else when you 're not <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#127:1:B>
<indig> Hindi ba </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#128:1:A>
Well uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#129:1:B>
And I 'm sure as you said

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#130:1:A>
You are you are sure of that in the U S

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#131:1:B>
Of course you have of course even if even while you are talking on the phone <{1> <[1> and you want </[1> to tape the conversation <{2> <[2> you have to </[2> tell the person the other person you 're talking with that you you 're taping the conversation

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#132:1:A>
<[1> But how about </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#133:1:A>
<[2> You have to tell him </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#134:1:A>
Hold it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#135:1:B>
I don't think that happened here

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#136:1:A>
But hold it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#137:1:A>
I have seen television documentaries where uh the commentator himself said this was taken by hidden camera <,> and if it was a hidden camera it means the the subjects did not know they were being filmed

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#138:1:B>
They were not allowed to but and uh of course they the subjects did not allow it I I mean the subjects did not know it at all

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#139:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#140:1:B>
Probably and possibly they were not allowed in uh to be interviewed in the first place

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#141:1:A>
And so they the footage was taken <{> <[> anyway </[> and it was aired anyway

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#142:1:B>
<[> And they have to squeeze </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#143:1:B>
And they have to squeeze uh something from

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#144:1:A>
And uh uhm the television station was not taken into court

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#145:1:B>
Uh uhm yeah that 's true

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#146:1:A>
Oh <{> <[> anyway </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#147:1:B>
<[> But </[> </{> I don't think that 's the the problem is I don't think that that will be used uh in a court of law
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#148:1:B>
You must get a lawyer for this you know

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#149:1:A>
<O> laughter </O> Okay anyone out there with uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#150:1:B>
<{> <[> Comments </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#151:1:A>
<[> With an <.> ope </.> </[> </{> <{> <[> with an opinion </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#152:1:B>
<[> Who 's a lawyer </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#153:1:A>
And with uh relevant uh to what we are discussing here uhm I am interested because sometimes we go out to the field <{> <[> and we do interviews and </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#154:1:B>
<[> So what what you 're saying is uh </[> </{> Howie should have identified himself

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#155:1:A>
<mention> Should should </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#156:1:A>
Is the journalist is the reporter <,> uh required to tell the interviewee that it is going it may be used

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#157:1:B>
<indig> Siguro </indig> come to think of it <indig> siguro <indig> in this case a hidden camera is uh is is good enough <indig> kasi walang ano e walang </indig> uh I don't think the the this uh <unclear> word </unclear> this uh
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#158:1:B>
How do you call it these companies would want their executives to be uh interviewed on camera <indig> kaya </indig> Howie had to resort to that

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#159:1:A>
No but uh Howie did not use a hidden camera
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#160:1:A>
The the camera was not <{> <[> hidden at all </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#161:1:B>
<[> Because </[> </{> he was supposed to be <{> <[> a scuba-diver </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#162:1:A>
<[> He just </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#163:1:A>
He just used uh what you might call false pretenses <O> chuckle </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#164:1:A>
Another musical break please Boy <O> music </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#165:1:A>
Actually Howie Severino <,> his topic was on <foreign> muro ami </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#166:1:A>
Uh I

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#167:1:B>
What about <foreign> muro ami </foreign> specifically this fishing part

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#168:1:A>
I had I had uh <,> two two people asked me what really is <foreign> muro ami </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#169:1:A>
And I think Emilia is also asking what what really is <foreign> muro ami </foreign> all about

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#170:1:B>
Yes what really is <foreign> muro ami </foreign> Vic

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#171:1:A>
Uh this is the way I I I got it from way way back we were fighting the <foreign> muro ami </foreign> uh thing in in media and in all fronts until it was finally banned
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#172:1:A>
<mention> <foreign> Muro ami </foreign> </mention> is actually a Japanese term 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#173:1:B>
Meaning

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#174:1:A>
You know you know <indig> dalagang bukid </indig> <,> the the species of fish
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#175:1:A>
Anyway it 's it 's coral coral reef dwellers

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#176:1:B>
Uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#177:1:A>
They come in large numbers and you 've you 've seen television footages underwater

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#178:1:B>
Oh yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#179:1:A>
You you imagine a coral reef plenty of fish and at the edge of the reef you drop a long long huge net
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#180:1:A>
But how do you get the fish to go into the net <,> so that they get entangled in the net
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#181:1:A>
You drive them into the net

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#182:1:B>
Bodily

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#183:1:A>
But in <foreign> muro ami </foreign> they use children <,> to drive

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#184:1:B>
So they submerge children

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#185:1:A>
No you see the children are actually <.> fly </.> uh swimming on on the surface of the water

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#186:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#187:1:A>
But they are holding what they call <mention> scare lines </mention> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#188:1:B>
Scare lines

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#189:1:A>
Goads

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#190:1:B>
Uh huh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#191:1:A>
But at the end of the scare line are heavy things like steel or rocks or lead
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#192:1:A>
And they pull <{> <[> this </[> up and down

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#193:1:B>
<[> And down </[> </{> to scare the

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#194:1:A>
So that it hits <{> <[> it hits </[> the corals

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#195:1:A>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#196:1:A>
And sound is magnified many times when it 's under water

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#197:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#198:1:A>
It reverberates
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#199:1:A>
So you can imagine how scared this <{> <[> this fish </[> are they they scamper in all directions but there there is no escape

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#200:1:B>
<[> <indig> Dalagang bukid </indig> </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#201:1:B>
Because the net is there already

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#202:1:A>
Because this is this is a long line of children abreast 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#203:1:B>
Huh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#204:1:A>
Moving towards the net
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#205:1:A>
Am I giving you a <{> <[> good enough </[> a good enough picture

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#206:1:B>
<[> Oh sure </[> </{> yeah clear as mud

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#207:1:A>
But in the process the corals are broken and uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#208:1:B>
But the end result is what they want <,> <{> <[> the <indig> dalagang bukid </indig> </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#209:1:A>
<[> The end result </[> </{> is they <{> <[> get a lot of fish </[> okay

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#210:1:B>
<[> They get the <indig> dalagang bukid </indig> </[> </{> yeah 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#211:1:A>
Uh fast track a little bit
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#212:1:A>
Sometime in the mid eighties we succeeded in having uh the the this method banned in the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#213:1:A>
But the operators of <foreign> muro ami </foreign> and one of the names very closely associated with <foreign> muro ami </foreign> was a Congressman-politican from Cebu

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#214:1:B>
Whose name is 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#215:1:A>
Whose name is <@> Amante </@> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#216:1:A>
And what made this controversial was that uh most of the <foreign> muro ami </foreign> ships were employing children as young as ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen years old

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#217:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#218:1:A>
And uh if a kid suddenly got entangled in a net because sometimes the net gets entangled and kids had to dive to untangle the net <,> and if they

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#219:1:B>
That that gets entangled in the coral

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#220:1:A>
Yes and if and if the current suddenly changes in the direction of the diving kid he can get he himself can get entangled in the net

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#221:1:B>
And there have been instances like this

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#222:1:A>
<indig> Ay </indig> there were plenty of deaths
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-038#223:1:A>
And uh in that segment and in that segment of uh Howie Severino there were graves the graves of the kids were shown
