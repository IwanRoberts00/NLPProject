My professor pastor uh Brother Gregory my colleagues in the History Department and other departments who are represented here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#2:1:A>
Oh I 'm sorry Dean uh Presentacion Gabriel uh dear students
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#3:1:A>
I would like to talk about Manila as a microcosm of Philippine history
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#4:1:A>
The things I 'm going to say might not be really new to some of you but uh what I intend to do is to telescope this in one continuous narrative 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#5:1:A>
Today Greater Manila also known as Metro Manila or the National Capital Region comprises the four cities of Manila Quezon Caloocan and Pasay and the thirteen municipalities of Muntinlupa Para&ntilde;aque Makati Las Pi&ntilde;as Pateros Taguig Mandaluyong Pasig San Juan Marikina Malabon Navotas and Valenzuela
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#6:1:A>
It is a sprawling metropolis which according to the nineteen-ninety national census has an aggregate population of seven point eight million which is the <.> th </.> which is thirteen percent of the total Philippine estimated population of uh sixty point five million <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#7:1:A>
Ranked the world 's twenty-third largest city in nineteen eighty-five Manila by the year two thousand is projected to have eleven point one million population thus becoming the sixteenth in ranking outgrowing such megalopolises as Los Angeles London Moscow and others
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#8:1:A>
Even today Manila has a bigger population than countries such as Kuwait Bayra Bahrain El Salvador Ireland and New Zealand among many others
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#9:1:A>
As one of the great metropolises of the world Metro Manila shares the comforts and amenities of modern-day living
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#10:1:A>
Within its confines are a world class Cultural Center complex well-planned and luxurious subdivisions of the rich architecturally impressive high rise condominium office and residential buildings spanking hotels antiseptic hospitals with the latest in equipment and highly trained personnel theaters <,> museums art galleries and modernistic shopping centers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#11:1:A>
After years of dictatorship it now boasts of a democratic system of government <,> at times seemingly confused and directionless and one of the freest if licentious presses of the world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#12:1:A>
Alas Manila also shares the common problems of huge cities like river land and air pollution impossible traffic jams mass unemployment festering slums smelly and dirty children roaming city streets and alleys male female and child prostitution and a crime rate which however is not much more than that of Chicago and New York
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#13:1:A>
Manila had in the past witnessed historical developments that had made imprints and its emergence growth and development which have cast and will long continue to cast their shadow for many more years to come
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#14:1:A>
Manila had for instance witnessed the arrival of the Spanish Dutch American and Japanese invaders who came trampling its sacred shores
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#15:1:A>
The Dutch never made a permanent inroad in Manila 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#> after many attempts they retreated to nearby present-day Indonesia which they also dominated for hundreds of years
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#16:1:A>
Nor did the British or the Japanese whose occupation of Manila lasted no more than a few years
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#17:1:A>
But the Spaniards remained and ruled the Philippines for over three hundred years from fifteen sixty-five to eighteen ninety-eight and <.> med </.> made Manila the religious military political cultural economic and business center of the whole archipelago
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#18:1:A>
The Americans who followed the Spaniards ruled the Philippines for over forty years nine eighteen ninety-eight nineteen forty-five also made Manila the center of the Philippine of Philippine life
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#19:1:A>
Its political military educational cultural and business machinery centered in the city
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#20:1:A>
The very early origins of Manila are however buried in the misty and remote past
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#21:1:A>
The early Filipino settlements long before the foreign invaders came were found along seacoasts the banks of rivers and lakes
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#22:1:A>
Not only did these give food for the populace and later irrigation for the agricultural lands they also provided the needed transport from one pre-colonial village to the other and thus facilitated the exchange of persons goods and ideas
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#23:1:A>
The early settlement of what is now known as Maynila as Manila was established along the Pasig River Manila Maynila to the south facing Manila Bay and to the north Tondo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#25:1:A>
Closely close-by were the villages which eventually became the towns forming later the <foreign> arrabales </foreign> of the city
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#26:1:A>
Since time immemorial Manila because of its strategic location was post to early Chinese Japanese Arab and Southeast Asians by chance who came in search of the of its products and bartered their own
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#27:1:A>
Before <unclear> words </unclear> galleon trade between the Philippines and Mexico which sustained the Spanish colonial rule was centered in Manila
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#28:1:A>
Manila also saw the establishment of the early factories in the country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#29:1:A>
The cigar and cigarette factories during the Spanish colonial regime were tourist attractions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#30:1:A>
And today all types of factories appliances food processing garment <,> automotive and chemical industries among many others are found in the Metro Manila area
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#31:1:A>
From Metro Manila American Japanese Chinese Taiwanese and Korean multinational companies direct their nationwide activities
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#32:1:A>
Many of the pre-colonial Chinese and Japanese traders opted to stay and married native women and thus enriching the early Filipino racial strains and for that matter the emergent Filipino culture
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#33:1:A>
Even before the intrusion of the Chinese and Japanese Manila had already developed its own culture its political structures however however basic and simple they might have been
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#34:1:A>
It evolved its early arts and lifestyle its religious beliefs its own economy its social classes and immediately prior to the Spanish occupation in <.> eight </.> in the fifteen seventies even began to evolve the beginnings of the institution of royalty which at that time had already been <?> aligned </?> and related to the royal house of Borneo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#35:1:A>
Such culture and lifestyle would be further enriched by the cultures of the other nations which came to the country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#36:1:A>
So that today Filipino culture is a mixture of an indigenous Malay substratum with the various layers of Chinese Indian Muslim Spanish Mexican American and to a very minor extent even Japanese culture
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#37:1:A>
Such influences may perhaps best be discerned in the racial stock which resulted from the various contacts with other peoples so that today hardly is there a Filipino much less a Manile&ntilde;o who has no mixed blood running in his veins and possibly in Manila more than in any other part of the archipelago is this more evident
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#38:1:A>
I think we just look at each other to realize what I mean to say
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#39:1:A>
Indeed today in spite of the outward veneer of what appears to be a dominant American influence like American music movies T V programs and the popular arts junk fast foods hamburgers even American lingo the deeper and the more perpa pervasive influence is Hispanic
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#40:1:A>
The Catholic religion and its deep influence in cultural in culture and lifestyle is a heritage from Spain
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#41:1:A>
That the Philippines and Manila for that matter shares with the other Latin American countries and cities of Spanish origin
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#42:1:A>
While Manila as it is very apparent from the outside shares some characteristic architectural similarities of the old churches and cathedrals ancient public and private edifices and indeed certain similarities in their social classes the <foreign> peninsulares </foreign> the <?> creonos </?> <foreign> <?> creo&ntilde;os </?> </foreign> the <foreign> mestizo </foreign> groups and native indigenous Indian population Manila has certain characteristics which differentiates it from Spanish American cities like Buenos Aires Lima or Mexico City
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#43:1:A>
This is of course understandable inasmuch as while Manila shares with these cities Spanish colonial rule for hundreds of years differences in geography and later day historical developments have made such differences imperative
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#44:1:A>
Manila for instance because of its peculiar relation to the outside world had had much more contacts with other nations that had than had the cities mentioned above
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#45:1:A>
As a result the population of Manila had had much more varied racial mixing than that of the Spanish-American cities
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#46:1:A>
The historical development of the Philippines and Manila is also something else
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#47:1:A>
Except for Puerto Rico which like the Philippines passed on to American rule after years of Spanish rule none of the South and Central and even North American countries passed on to other to another foreign rule after the Spanish colonial experience
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#48:1:A>
These countries became independent soon after their wars of independence against Spain
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#49:1:A>
Located at practically the center of the Philippine archipelago Manila has provided the vortex towards which the country 's population gravitated <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#50:1:A>
It is thus it thus became the political center of the country 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#> Hardly had the last smoke of the battle between the Spanish invaders and the native defenders of Maynila and Tondo cleared when the Spanish authorities established the amenities of an Iberian city
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#51:1:A>
The City of Manila had formed was formally established in June fourteen fifteen seventy-one with its own <foreign> ayuntamiento </foreign> city hall and its own <foreign> cabildo </foreign> and later its <.> Ro </.> <foreign> Royal Audiencia </foreign> the Supreme Court which also took over the reins of government when the governors-general resigned died or were incapacitated and its city council whose members conducted the day-by-day affairs of the city
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#52:1:A>
Over and above this officialdom was the governor-general the captain-general or the <foreign> adelantado </foreign> a special honorific title given only to Miguel Lopez de Legaspi the founder of the Spanish City of Manila who in effect was the highest government official and political leader of the colony
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#53:1:A>
Legaspi as it turned out led the troops in the pacification campaigns not only in the outlying areas close to Manila but also in the whole island of Luzon eminently aided by his grandson Juan de Salcedo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#54:1:A>
His appointment as <foreign> adelantado </foreign> of course as well as those of the higher ranking officials of Manila came from the Spanish King
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#55:1:A>
His successors would also best be known as captains-general or governors-general who were the highest officials in the country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#56:1:A>
As a result of the great distance which separated Manila from the Iberian metropolis and from the vice-royalty of New Spain or Mexico under which it was ruled for quite some time and the other Spanish colonies the Spanish governor-general in Manila embodied in his person powers other than political
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#57:1:A>
As representative of the Spanish King in this the farthest outpost of the vast Spanish empire he also had military diplomatic even religious powers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#58:1:A>
The Spanish governor general who held office in Manila also commanded the Spanish army in the islands
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#59:1:A>
As commander-in-chief he planned military campaigns and came out with strategies to quell local uprisings and repel the attacks of foreign invaders like the Dutch and the Chinese and local enemies like the Muslims from Southern Philippines who sporadically attacked the Christian Filipino settlements along the coastal regions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#60:1:A>
And now with religious powers he would send missionaries to <.> ne </.> nearby China and Japan not only as missionaries but even as diplomats who had ambassadorial ranks to establish relations with these countries
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#61:1:A>
The Spanish governor-general thus presided over the affairs of the colony
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#62:1:A>
Like him other ranking officials of invading troops like the latter day Americans and the Japanese would also reside in Manila initially with great military powers attached to their ranks and only later when these had more or less been established to <?> obtain </?> formerly established political structures and appoint civil and military officials who would help them rule the colony
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#63:1:A>
Manila under the Spaniards and to a certain extent under the Americans but even more so the Spaniards maintained a strict code regarding the social mixing of the various groups in the colony <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#64:1:A>
As in the other parts of the Spanish empire the peninsular Spaniards occupied the highest rung of the colonial social ladder
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#65:1:A>
From their ranks came the military political religious leadership of the colony
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#66:1:A>
Next in rank in the were the Philippine-born Spaniards or the creoles who were considered the original Filipinos or Filipinos <foreign> Espa&ntilde;oles </foreign> who while having Spanish blood on both sides of their ancestry were considered lower in rank than the peninsulars and therefore could not <,> assume the highest offices of the colonial administration
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#67:1:A>
Spanish and Chinese <foreign> mestizos </foreign> born of Spanish and Chinese fathers as the case may be and of native or of <foreign> mestizo </foreign> mothers had higher social status than the mass of indigenous Malay natives or the <foreign> indios </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#68:1:A>
By the <.> eight </.> eighteen seventies however when the three priests Burgos Gomez and Zamora who were executed allegedly for their complicity in the so-called Cavite mutiny of <.> eight </.> eighteen seventy-two the various sectors of Philippine society had begun to view themselves as Filipinos and begun to weld themselves together as a group distinct and apart from Spanish <foreign> peninsulares </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#69:1:A>
This welding together of these Filipino groups and the awareness of a common destiny was made more apparent during the propaganda movements when creoles Spanish and Chinese <foreign> mestizos </foreign> and local natives the <foreign> indios </foreign> pooled together their resources to advance the Filipino cause in Madrid and in other European capitals like London and Paris and in nearby Hong Kong
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#70:1:A>
Well a few of these propagandists like Marcelo del Pilar and the Pardo de Tavera brothers were already young professionals at the time
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#71:1:A>
Most of propagandists like Rizal Jose Maria Panganiban <.> an </.> were young men studying in Spain
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#72:1:A>
They maintained links with their countrymen in the Philippines mainly with those living in Manila
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#73:1:A>
Many came from the land-owning and the merchant class as a result of the opening of the Philippines to foreign trade in the nineteenth century and the cultivation of export crops like sugar Manila hemp indigo and to a very minor extent coffee
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-042#74:1:A>
This <.> flo </.> this class formed by rich Creole and <foreign> mestizo </foreign> families not only built substantial so-called earthquake baroque houses found in Manila <,> and could afford the amenities of contemporary living such as carriages imported from Austria furniture and <.> chan </.> chandeliers pianos harps and other prestige symbols from abroad not to say books and newspapers some of which were proscribed by the colonial regime for the subversive ideas that they were supposed to contain
