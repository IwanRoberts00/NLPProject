<h> <bold> AN ERAP ALBUM: A SCRIPT OF HIS-STORY </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#6:1>
Joseph &ldquo; Erap &rdquo; Estrada, who co-starred ( with Tony
Ferrer, Romeo Vasquez, Fernando Poe Jr. and Jess Lapid) in the 1974 film
<mention> <it> Suicide Commandos </it> </mention> ( Torre 1994), became a
real-life commander in chief less than a quarter of a century later.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#7:1>
At the close of 2000, he went down in history as the first Philippine
president to be impeached, and on January 20, 2001 he again made history as
the second, after Marcos, to be dislodged from Malaca&ntilde;ang through a
nonviolent popular revolt at EDSA.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#8:1>
To evade protesters massed in Mendiola, Estrada and his family exited
the Palace by barge, down the deathly Pasig River. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#9:1>
Between filmdom and his fall from power is a nation of narratives,
from personal stories to versions and perversions of history - the edges of
<indig> <it> pelikula </it> </indig> and <indig> <it> politika </it> </indig>
bleeding into each other during his term.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#10:1>
Indeed, Estrada <quote> &ldquo; could bring the illusion of the
cinema to the harsh reality of politics &rdquo; </quote> ( Benigno 2001).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#11:1>
He has, in fact, recast the vocabulary of Philippine politics to
include the lingo of show biz.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#12:1>
During EDSA II, for instance, his policy towards anti-Erap protesters
was one of &ldquo; mega-tolerance &rdquo; ( instead of Marcos 's maximum
tolerance), which seems to be a reworking of Sharon Cuneta 's title <mention>
&ldquo; megastar. &rdquo; </mention> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#13:1>
Newly installed President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo herself adopted
the show-biz phrase <mention> &ldquo; talent search &rdquo; </mention> to
refer to her screening committee that pinpointed potential cabinet members.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#14:1>
Of course, the most show-biz term of all was reserved for the lead
character: If Estrada has ordained himself a hero, it is in the cinematic
sense of the term, that of <indig> <it> bida </it> </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#15:1>
As he is made to say in a political cartoon on the front page of the
<it> Philippine Daily Inquirer </it> , 28 February 2001, <quote> &ldquo;
<indig> <it> Walang bida na nakulong sa </it> </indig> the end. &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#16:1>
This borrowing of motifs from the movie world has caught up even
with the foreign press, the <mention> <it> Economist </it> </mention> , 3
March 2001, for instance, in its article on President M-Macapagal-Arroyo:
<quote> &ldquo; After the B movie, a new main attraction for Filipinos.
&rdquo; </quote> </p> <X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#X17:1>
<quote> &ldquo; And although Mrs. Arroyo was elected
vice-president in 1998 with unprecedented support... she is now less trusted
than ever by most poor Filipinos, who see her as having stolen power from
their hero. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#X18:1>
And although his [ Erap 's] supporters might attempt their own
version of people power, the team that has just ousted him boasts all the
popular heroes of the genre: the country 's leading prelate, Cardinal Jaime
Sin, along with ex-President Corazon Aquino and Fidel Ramos." </quote> </p>
</X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#19:1>
Manifest here is the use of <mention> <it> hero </it> </mention>
in a fictional, literary sense, as in <quote> &ldquo; popular heroes of the
genre. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#20:1>
The term is used in reference neither to nationalism nor to the
<quote> &ldquo; heroes and heroines of EDSA People Power 2 &rdquo; </quote> (
<it> Philippine Star </it> , 22 February 2001).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#21:1>
Given these layers of meaning, how can one understand the concept of
<indig> <it> bida </it> </indig> <foreign> vis-&agrave;-vis </foreign> Erap
and EDSA II? </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#22:1>
<h> <bold> SPINNING A STORY </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#23:1>
By 2015, documented accounts of the impeachment trial and ouster
of former president Joseph Estrada will have been appended to college history
books, tucked between entries on presidents Fidel Ramos and Gloria Arroyo.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#24:1>
Like Arroyo 's story-in-progress, Estrada 's story will form part of
Filipino narratives of the future, recounted in books and retold by people,
just as Marcos ' story fifteen years ago is recalled in present-day
narratives.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#25:1>
By then, landmark events of 2000 and 2001 will have assumed some
stable configuration - as historical or journalistic texts and documentary
photographs and footages retrievable in libraries.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#26:1>
Erap, too, as a figure in Philippine political history, will be
configured and viewed in such forms. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#27:1>
This paper concerns itself not so much with the telling of such
stable histories as with the more amorphous discourse of storytelling.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#28:1>
It looks at Erap not as a figure in some historical text, but as a
character in homespun stories that Filipinos may tell now and in the future.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#29:1>
As with folk narratives in the past, stories, especially as oral
discourse, take on several versions.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#30:1>
As a recollection, each Erap story regarding his impeachment trial
and EDSA II is bound to assume a different slant, a different mode of
storytelling.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#31:1>
Yet, being anchored on history, such divergent versions ultimately
yield commonalities, particularly in terms of events, personages, and
locations - elements which, correspondingly, fictionists call plot,
character, and setting.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#32:1>
It is in this sense then, of Erap 's history being transfigured into
flexible narratives, that this paper seeks to address the subject <mention>
&ldquo; Erap and the Concept of <indig> <it> Bida </it> </indig> . &rdquo;
</mention>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#33:1>
Specifically, in the EDSA II story, is there a <indig> <it> bida
</it> </indig> ?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#34:1>
Is Erap that <indig> <it> bida </it> </indig> ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#35:1>
Relied on here are mostly <quote> &ldquo; peripheral histories,"
</quote> photographs, political cartoons, diaries, personal stories, e-mail
messages, opinion columns, commentaries, letters to the editor, entertainment
columns, and footages from memory, apart from straightforward news ( the less
reportorial the information source, the more suggestive it is of the extent
and breadth of the phenomenon involved). </p>

<h> <bold> DISOWNING A DIARY </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#37:1>
That people tend to write histories that remember them may
explain why <quote> &ldquo; Edsa II story has many versions" </quote> ( <it>
Philippine Daily Inquirer </it> , 7 February 2001).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#38:1>
Apart from Erap 's trusted Executive Secretary Edgardo Angara 's
three-part diary on the <quote> &ldquo; final days &rdquo; </quote> of the
Estrada administration ( published in the <it> Philippine Daily Inquirer
</it> , 4-6 February 2001), <quote> &ldquo; Armed of the Philippines Chief of
Staff Gen. Angelo Reyes will also be writing his own account of the People
Power Part II phenomenon... &rdquo; </quote> </p> <X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#X39:1>
<quote> But...his version of the events had been placed under a
cloud by another group in the military which had claimed it was they who
worked for the defection of the AFP... </p>

<p> ...Former President Cory Aquino appeared pleased that Angara is not alone
in keeping a record of events of the last hours of the Estrada presidency to
make the story 'more factual...' &rdquo; </quote> </p> </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#40:1>
Even as Aquino says that points in Angara 's &ldquo;
recollections &rdquo; have been <quote> &ldquo; disputed, &rdquo; </quote>
deposed President Joseph Estrada himself has disavowed Angara 's chronicle:
<quote> &ldquo; Accurate or not, the diary was not admissible in court.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#41:1>
It 's his diary, not mine. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#42:1>
Unfortunately for Estrada, <quote> &ldquo; The Supreme Court had
quoted liberally from the Angara diary when it ruled that Ms. Macapagal is
the legitimate president, &rdquo; </quote> as noted by Yamsuan and Marfil,
<it> Philippine Daily Inquirer </it> , 4 March 2001. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#43:1>
Jimenez-David, in <mention> &ldquo; Telling the story of People
Power 2, &rdquo; </mention> claims that <quote> &ldquo; We are the authors of
the story of People Power 2 and of Erap 's departure, &rdquo; </quote>
complaining that <quote> &ldquo; like those ingrates, Enrile and Honasan,
after People Power 1, the generals are attempting to rewrite history, or at
least tell their story from their point of view... &rdquo; </quote> </p> <X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#X44:1>
<quote> &ldquo; No one denies the about-face by Chief of Staff
Gen. Angelo Reyes and Defense Secretary Orly Mercado was indeed a turning
point for People Power 2.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#X45:1>
But no one should forget either that People Power 2 began
unexpectedly, without planning or organizing...

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#X46:1>
The story began not with coup plotters, politicians, organized
groups or even text messages... &rdquo; </quote> </p> </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#47:1>
Other versions of EDSA II include <mention> &ldquo; De Villa:
Factual except for omissions, &rdquo; </mention> a rectification by Villa of
Angara 's diary, <mention> &ldquo; Ousting a president - a report from
Mendiola &rdquo; </mention> by Nicanor Perlas of Kompil 2 ( he oddly calls
EDSA II <quote> &ldquo; Peoples Power &rdquo; </quote> ) , <mention> &ldquo;
What happened behind palace doors on that last day, &rdquo; </mention> an
eyewitness account relayed to Neal Cruz, <mention> &ldquo; View from the

forthcoming diary. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#48:1>
What danger lies in these versions of history?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#49:1>
Conrado de Quiros warns of <quote> &ldquo; the power of a story
&rdquo; </quote> to imprint an interpretation of history upon the public
consciousness and so distort it to the detriment of many.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#50:1>
( Referring to Corazon Aquino 's selective story of her husband, de
Quiros is wary of <quote> &ldquo; the effects of that version of history [
which] we are still reeling from. &rdquo; </quote> ) </p> <X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#X51:1>
<quote> &ldquo; And that is what the various self-appointed
rescuers of Philippine honor, dignity and freedom are trying to tell - or
capture.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#X52:1>
Which is one thing we may not allow ourselves to lose again: Our
story, the story of a people who...rose to reclaim the life they had lost.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#X53:1>

youth and farmers and fishermen and factory hands and barbers and artists and

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#54:1>
Despite the absence of a unanimous version, it is possible to
demarcate a common ground through signs, which will not be heralded by
history, in its obsession for events. </p>

Before the day ends, the Supreme Court demolishes his bid to reclaim

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#60:1>
End of story? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#61:1>
Philippine politics has a way of lodging itself into the realm of
signs, such that objects and events take on layers of meaning.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#62:1>
Erap 's fall from the stage, for instance, is not only an event but
also a sign ( an omen, a metaphor) for his fall from power.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#63:1>
Likewise, the stage from which he falls is not just a physical
platform, but also a metaphor for a cultural space: Philippine politics is a
stage for public performance.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#64:1>
Furthermore, in Philippine politics a sign may also assume the nature
of metonymy, whereby a famous or infamous public figure is called to mind
through a substitute verbal, hand, or visual code that sometimes appears to
have little or no real connection to the figure 's name ( <foreign> e.g.
</foreign> , <mention> Brenda </mention> , for a <quote> &ldquo;
brain-damaged &rdquo; </quote> lady senator). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#65:1>
Heroes in any popular exercise, be it an election, movement or
uprising, rise to the level of signs; that is, the overriding, central figure
is <quote> &ldquo; semiologically dominant, &rdquo; </quote> one whose
identity is summoned into the popular consciousness through a host of
signifiers ( a moniker, symbol, color code, or any other identifying marks)
widely current in use.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#66:1>
Communities do not ascribe and constantly use an identifying sign to
refer to an unknown individual; hence, being identified by the public through
signs is a mark of popularity.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#67:1>
The extent of its use also indicates the degree of popularity ( in
both the positive and negative senses of the word).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#68:1>
In this case, a sign is widely and unambiguously understood by its
users.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#69:1>
Although, as Saussure theorizes, a signifier and signified have an
arbitrary connection ( Selden 1985) [ Barthes says that the <quote> &ldquo;
arbitrary nature of the linguistic sign receives a purely cultural motivation
in the mythological system &rdquo; </quote> ( Rabate 1994)] and generally a
single signifier may have more than one referent, as used in reference to
popular heroes a particular signifier, by convention, points unmistakably to
a single person or group.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#70:1>
A sign, furthermore, elicits immediate recall. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#71:1>
This phenomenon admits of a communal adoption of signs or of a
communal assimilation of what may have been, originally, individually
determined signs ( <foreign> e.g. </foreign> , <mention> &ldquo; Cory yellow
&rdquo; </mention> from Ninoy Aquino 's borrowing of <mention> &ldquo; Tie a
yellow ribbon... &rdquo; </mention> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#72:1>
Taken in relation to Barthes ' notion of <quote> &ldquo; cultural
revision &rdquo; </quote> ( appropriation of associated meaning), EDSA I, for
instance, may also be seen as a pretext of the EDSA II <mention> &ldquo;
text, &rdquo; </mention> in terms of signs and motifs.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#73:1>
In this case, EDSA I provides one the template with which to make
sense out of the myriad elements of EDSA II.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#74:1>
Already, the whole phenomenon of EDSA has built-in meanings (
including the notion of nonviolence and mass protest along Epifanio de los
Santos Avenue), for it has risen to the level of myth ( in the Barthesian
sense). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#75:1>
The meanings of signs are socially determined or
conventionalized, as evinced in the following glimpses of EDSA II.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#76:1>
Conversely, such signs provide glimpses into the mentalities or
constructs at work in the society in which they operate. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#77:1>
Begun in March 5, 2000, the Silent Protest Movement was signified
by <mention> &ldquo; <it> ! </it> &ldquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#78:1>
The group wearing stickers with the slanted exclamation point was
<quote> &ldquo; the first middle-class oriented drive for the ouster of then
President Joseph Estrada, &rdquo; </quote> says Contreras in the <mention>
<it> Philippine Daily Inquirer </it> </mention> , 5 March 2001.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#79:1>
This laid the groundwork for a nonverbal grammar of dissent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#80:1>
On January 29, 2001, Estrada supporters gathered in front of the
Supreme Court to question <quote> &ldquo; the legitimacy of the nine-day old
presidency of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, &rdquo; </quote> waving posters with
oversized question marks.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#81:1>
Similarly, their foreheads bore <mention> &ldquo; ? &rdquo;
</mention> stickers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#82:1>
Clearly such signs are not only containers of human or object
referents; they are also <mention> &ldquo; comment bearers, &rdquo;
</mention> if not ideological markers.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#83:1>
Even at the incipient stages, the collective use ( as well as nonuse)
of signs constructs notions of social identity; signs become the means for
one to identify - and identify with - a public figure.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-005#84:1>
As a result, signs become sociopolitical forces to contend with:
signs divide society ( Saussure 's relations of difference), even as these
unify their respective users. </p>

Given the mass ( or mob, depending on whose side one is) nature
of the EDSA People Power phenomenon, the widespread, frequent use of signs
becomes a requisite to communal identity, cohesiveness and, in the end,
political triumph. </p>
