<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#3:1>
Linda Reyes takes breakfast alone in her small and silent kitchen.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#4:1>
A simple meal: a cup of coffee and a warm roll.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#5:1>
She eats slowly, spreading a thin layer of pale butter over the bread
in a painstaking manner.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#6:1>
Her way of eating, so deliberate and almost contemplative, would
surprise her colleagues.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#7:1>
They know Dr. Linda Reyes for her swiftness and intuitive efficiency
in the hospital operating room. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#8:1>
Those who have not seen Linda in a crowded emergency room would
not be surprised by her slowness.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#9:1>
She has just turned fifty but she looks much older.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#10:1>
Wrinkles spread over her dark face in gently expanding arcs and
creases.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#11:1>
Linda feels most hurt when her wrinkled bony face, the mask of her
compassion, frightens her younger patients with their shiny pink faces and
full ruddy cheeks. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#12:1>
The bread she eats is <foreign> pan de sal </foreign> ( bread of
salt), but it does not taste salty and she no longer wonders why.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#13:1>
The coffee Linda drinks, lukewarm and bitter, was brewed by Talaba.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#14:1>
The housekeeper came downstairs earlier that morning, brewed the
coffee, then returned upstairs to sleep.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#15:1>
It is a Monday and Linda is too tired to complain about the meal or
to scold Talaba.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#16:1>
And given how little she pays Talaba, and how behind she is in
payment of Talaba 's salary, she knows she can't be too demanding.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#17:1>
The dull thuds of sluggish steps on the staircase interrupt the
silence of Linda 's meal.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#18:1>
Her husband Nilo enters the kitchen with a newspaper in his hand,
with his mouth half-open and eyes half-closed.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#19:1>
The face of a fish.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#20:1>
She recalls how dashing he was when she first met him, the playboy
son of the general and ten years her junior.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#21:1>
Even then she looked older than her age, and everyone said she was
too thin.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#22:1>
So she felt very lucky when he proposed to her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#23:1>
Even now, with Nilo in a half-awake state, she still finds him
attractive.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#24:1>
Even now, she still feels lucky to have him. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#25:1>
What is Nilo doing up this early?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#26:1>
His rising before noon is a rare occurrence, one prohibited by
Federal and state law, as Linda jokes grimly to her friends.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#27:1>
What does he want?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#28:1>
Perhaps he needs money for one of his trips; but today is not the
correct day.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#29:1>
She asks him why he is awake so early. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#30:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I wanted to talk to you before you left for work.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#31:1>
It 's about what we talked about last night. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#32:1>
Last night Linda had asked Nilo about getting a new car.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#33:1>
She had talked to her friends, to other doctors at the hospital, to
Tessie of course, and they all agreed: it was time for her to buy a new car.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#34:1>
The financing terms and interest rates were excellent and weren't
going to get any better.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#35:1>
No money down.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#36:1>
She could, and probably would, worry about the payments later.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#37:1>
Based as it was on these financial realities, the proposal was
sensible, not self-indulgent.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#38:1>
The car she would buy would be practical, safe, and reliable.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#39:1>
It would get good mileage and accommodate the family comfortably.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#40:1>
While not flashy, it would have just enough cachet for Linda to drive
it to the weekend parties of her fellow Filipino physicians. </p>

<p>

<quote> &ldquo; I think we should get a new car, &rdquo; </quote>
Nilo announces.

He speaks as if the idea were his own.

<quote> &ldquo; Okay then, &rdquo; </quote> she says, pleased,
<quote> &ldquo; we 'll go to the dealerships next week. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#44:1>
She sips her coffee.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#45:1>
Even the hospital brew is better than this tar that Talaba calls
coffee. </p>

Linda pauses for a moment. </p>

<quote> &ldquo; A sedan, a four-door.

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#52:1>
Nilo looks up from his plate to make eye contact with his wife.

<p>

He reaches over the table to place his hand on hers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#56:1>
<quote> &ldquo; What are you thinking of? &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#57:1>
Apprehension hangs in her voice. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#58:1>
<quote> &ldquo; A sports car, &rdquo; </quote> Nilo says
brightly.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#59:1>
<quote> &ldquo; A convertible.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#60:1>
I like this one. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#61:1>
Nilo shows her the newspaper he holds in his other hand, the
advertisement in the corner.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#62:1>
She sees the drawing of a sleek car with aggressive lines.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#63:1>
With its strange curves and its headlights like squinting eyes, the
car reminds her of a snake her father once killed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#64:1>
Linda 's fork falls to the floor when she sees the price. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#68:1>
He waits, letting her catch her breath. </p>

<quote> &ldquo; Look at it, &rdquo; </quote> he says calmly,
softly, <quote> &ldquo; it 's a beautiful car and it only costs that much.
&rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#70:1>
He cannot bring himself to say the amount; he merely points at the
number in the newspaper.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#71:1>
<quote> &ldquo; We can afford that, can't we? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#72:1>
Linda thinks: Can I make those payments?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#73:1>
Can I work any harder than I do now? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#74:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I can't work more hours, &rdquo; </quote> she
says, <quote> &ldquo; I just can't.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#75:1>
That 's it. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#76:1>
Her voice is not commanding but pleading, desperate.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#77:1>
Perhaps she does not mean what she says.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#78:1>
Perhaps what she truly means is: I could make that extra money, but
please, please don't make me do it.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#79:1>
And to think that everyone believes that doctors are rich.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#80:1>
She resents the popular belief that doctors have no money problems.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#81:1>
When you work as an underpaid doctor in an inner city public
hospital, when your fledgling private practice can't get off the ground, when
you send your son to college and your daughter to an expensive summer camp,
and when your husband piles up huge debts, then you have money problems. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#82:1>
Linda feels Nilo squeezing her hand. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#83:1>
&ldquo; Lin, you don't have to work more hours.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#84:1>
There are other ways.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#85:1>
We can spend less on other things.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#86:1>
Or we could spend a little less, and maybe you could work a little
more. &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#87:1>
Or maybe, maybe Nilo could get a job.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#88:1>
Would that be such a radical idea?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#89:1>
His weak excuses for not working are running out. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#90:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Nilo, I really don't think that would work.
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#91:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Please, &rdquo; </quote> he says, <quote> &ldquo;
please think about it.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#92:1>
For me. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#93:1>
Nilo rises from the table.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#94:1>
As he leaves the room, he kisses Linda gently on the cheek.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#95:1>
She tries to hide from him the thrill she feels.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#96:1>
After he leaves, she silently scolds herself for the schoolgirl
reaction to his affection.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#97:1>
The kiss, a neatly packaged act of manufactured affection, meant
nothing to Nilo, Linda knows.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#98:1>
But it still meant something to her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#99:1>
What will she do about this problem?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#100:1>
How can she work any harder?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#101:1>
It may not be possible.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#102:1>
If it is possible, however, then she has a duty.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#103:1>
Her sense of duty, developed during the many years spent under the
sisters of St. Catherine 's, weighs down on Linda as she sits alone in the
kitchen. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#104:1>
What student of St. Catherine 's could forget Ephesians 5?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#105:1>
It was the chapter they had drilled into them year after year, the
chapter they were made to memorize.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#106:1>
Especially important were verses 22 through 24: <X> <quote> &ldquo;
Wives, be subject to your husbands, as to the Lord.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#X107:1>
For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of
the church, his body, and is himself its Savior.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#X108:1>
As the church is subject to Christ, so let wives also be subject in
everything to their husbands. &rdquo; </quote> </X>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#109:1>
These were words that Linda 's mother lived by, and words she hopes
to live by as well. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#110:1>
Linda drives along the Francis Lewis Boulevard with the anxious
effort of someone who does not trust her driving skills or those of other
commuters.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#111:1>
She keeps the car mostly in the right lane, venturing into the
middle lane only rarely and switching out at the earliest opportunity.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#112:1>
She signals lane changes and exits early, perhaps too early.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#113:1>
She drives with her hands gripping the wheel tightly, her neck
craned so she can look in her mirrors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#114:1>
Despite the effort she puts into driving, she still has time to
reflect on other matters.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#115:1>
Her thoughts turn to the home she has just left.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#116:1>
What is Nilo doing right now?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#117:1>
He has probably returned to bed.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#118:1>
Maybe he 's watching television. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#119:1>
The car behind Linda is tailgating her, but she won't drive any
faster. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#120:1>
If he 's in such a hurry, he can pass. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#121:1>
Why do I go to work every day while my husband sits at home
watching game shows he doesn't understand?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#122:1>
Why should I earn money to pay for his indiscretions, his petty
vices?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#123:1>
Why should I serve him like a slave?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#124:1>
The image of red and white chips against green felt passes through
her mind.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#125:1>
She pays while he plays, and it makes her angry to think about it.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#126:1>
Then Linda catches herself.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#127:1>
She cannot entertain these thoughts; he is still her husband.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#128:1>
The words of Ephesians return to her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#129:1>
The words of her mother, uttered in her last days, return to her
with a startling urgency.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#130:1>
In those pain-filled days in a crowded ward, in a nameless hospital
in a <foreign> barrio </foreign> in Batangas, a mother shared with a daughter
the secrets of the world. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#131:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Be a good girl, Linda, &rdquo; </quote> her
mother told her, her frail body shrouded in gray sheets that were once white.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#132:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Someday you will have a family.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#133:1>
Care for your children.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#135:1>
This is what God has called us to do <foreign> hija </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#136:1>
What we do in this life will be remembered when we enter the next.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#137:1>
What would her mother say if she could see her daughter now?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#138:1>
Her mother died when Linda was twenty.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#139:1>
Linda knows her mother never expected her to survive the four long
years of medical school.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#140:1>
Her mother had argued against sending her to medical school, despite
her scholarship.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#141:1>
Medicine was a man 's field, her mother thought, and women could not
handle the pressure. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#142:1>
<quote> &ldquo; What does she need to go to med school for?
&rdquo; </quote> This was the question Linda 's mother asked of her father,
in a conversation she overheard from the yard where she was hanging the
laundry on the clothesline. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#143:1>
<quote> &ldquo; What she needs, &rdquo; </quote> continued her
mother, <quote> &ldquo; is a good husband who will love her, provide for her,
protect her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#144:1>
That 's all she needs. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#145:1>
But it did not take long for Linda 's mother to give in to her
father, just as she always did.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#146:1>
Thank God that her father prevailed in the argument, thus turning
Linda 's going to medical school into a duty she had to fulfill for her
family 's sake.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#147:1>
In medical school she received the education that gave her so many
opportunities.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#148:1>
If not for her education, she would have nothing, because she
certainly didn't get the good husband. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#149:1>
Linda wonders about what her mother would have said about buying
a new car, and more specifically, a bright new sports car.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#150:1>
How would she have resolved the conflict between her frugal nature
and her belief in the absolute rule of the husband? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#151:1>
The morning shift at the Kingsview emergency room was unusually
busy and hectic, but Linda had made it to her lunch break at last.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#152:1>
After eating a small salad of limp vegetables served at the hospital
cafeteria, she returns to the doctors ' lounge, where she makes a short phone
call to Tessie, the person whose opinions she values above all others.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#153:1>
Tessie is a natural person to call for advice; their friendship
dates back all the way to medical school at U.P. <&> U.P. = University of the
Philippines </&> , and Linda has always admired Tessie for her happy marriage
and successful career. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#154:1>
Linda won't be able to talk for long since there are only
fifteen minutes left in her break, and she will end her break early because
much work remains to be done.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#155:1>
In her day of headache and sweat, this is the only time she can
spare. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#156:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Hello, the Santos residence, &rdquo; </quote>
says Marie, Tessie 's housekeeper, speaking with a Filipino accent stronger
but not unlike the accents of Tessie and Linda. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#157:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Marie?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#158:1>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#161:1>
Tessie is on the phone shortly and greets Linda cheerfully.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#162:1>
The two engage in small talk for a few minutes.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#163:1>
Then Linda outlines her upcoming decision about what car she should
buy.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#164:1>
She would like to listen to Nilo, but his suggestion in this case is
both impractical and extravagant.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#165:1>
The car he wants is simply beyond their means, she tells Tessie.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#166:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Linda, I see the arguments here, &rdquo;
</quote> Tessie says, then pauses.

<quote> &ldquo; I 'm not sure, &rdquo; </quote> she says
hesitantly.

<quote> &ldquo; No matter what you do, make certain that the
decision you make is your own, and not your rationalization of his decision,
&rdquo; </quote> Tessie says firmly. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#192:1>
As usual, Tessie has provided wise counsel, although there are
some things Linda knows Tessie will never understand about her, such as why
she married Nilo, why she loves him so intensely even after all she has been
through with him, and how much she needs the emotional anchoring of his
<foreign> cari&ntilde;o </foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#193:1>
Linda thanks her friend and then hangs up.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#194:1>
She stands up from her chair and starts putting her white jacket
back on.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#195:1>
Time to return to work. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#196:1>
It is a few minutes before midnight, and Linda is now on her
evening break.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#197:1>
She finishes her black coffee while standing next to the counter of
the small kitchen in the doctor 's lounge.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#198:1>
She could sit down on the battered gray couch, but standing is her
custom.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#199:1>
Now she will return to the emergency room although she doesn't have
to return yet.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#200:1>
She has five minutes left in her break and she can still taste the
strong coffee.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#201:1>
But Linda never uses all of the time she receives for breaks; there
is work to be done.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-006#202:1>
The doctors back home took long breaks, napping or having <indig>
merienda </indig> while the patients waited for them in the operating room.
