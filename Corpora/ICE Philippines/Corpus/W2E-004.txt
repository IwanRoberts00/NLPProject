<h> <bold> An action agenda </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#2:1>
AN ACTION AGENDA to speed up economic recovery from the current
financial crisis plaguing Southeast Asian countries, emerged at a meeting the
other day of the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council in
Malaca&ntilde;ang. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#3:1>
Presided over by no less than President Ramos himself, the Council
heard Socio-Economic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito unveil some reform
measures on the assumption that the economic difficulties may well get worse
before they get better. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#4:1>
In this briefing, Habito, who is also director-general of the
National Economic and Development Authority, told the gathering that the
Action Agenda aims primarily to reduce current account deficits, maintain
financial stability and the growth momentum, keep prices stable, sustain the
momentum of reforms and support the disadvantaged. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#5:1>
He explained that some of these measures are already being
implemented. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#6:1>
Under the Action Agenda, the following will be pursued by the
Ramos administration:

<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#7:1>
1) Fiscal discipline, which means the government is committed to a
&peso;7.6 billion surplus by the end of 1997; 2) strengthen fiscal and
monetary coordination to ensure consistent approaches to interest rate
determination through open market operations; 3) tighter monitoring of
government-owned and controlled firms by determining and assessing their
financial condition; 4) rationalization of fiscal incentive package for
private investors; 5) intensification of savings campaign backed by all
levels of government and the private sector; 6) a stronger banking system by
amending the General Banking Act; and, 7) a healthier corporate sector
through monitoring of the financial conditions of the corporate sector,
particularly non-bank financial institutions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#8:1>
All these may require a review of existing investment programs
with a view of giving priority to socially efficient projects over those with
so-called low absorptive capacity or with cost overruns.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#9:1>
It may also involve tightening of the government 's revenue program by
plugging loopholes and import leakages. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#10:1>
Investments on government-owned and controlled corporations
encountering deficits may also have to be deferred. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#11:1>
The current crisis does not have to end in disaster and it is
incumbent upon government to keep its macro-economic fundamentals strong and
sound.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#12:1>
In short, the Action Agenda are but preparations for necessary
belt-tightening and economic and political reforms. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#13:1>
If properly pursued with greater openness and sincerity, there is
no reason why the country cannot benefit from the lessons of this current
economic crisis. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Wage adjustments </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#15:2>
WHILE THERE SEEMS to be no dispute on the need for a wage hike,
the question is whether the matter of determining the level of increase
should be left to various regional wage boards or to Congress. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#16:2>
Both these two bodies have a direct line with the mass of working
people in the country, but the wage boards have a better grasp of the problem
because they continue to deal with it on the basis of daily contact with
workers in their respective areas. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#17:2>
Even members of Congress themselves agree that the wage boards in
the different regions are in a better position to decide the rate of wage
increases, but they added that they must decide the matter as soon as
possible.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#18:2>
Otherwise, they argued, Congress stands ready to legislate wage
increases should there be a failure on the part of the regional wage board to
act. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#19:2>
In a tripartite consultation presided by President Ramos in
Malaca&ntilde;ang, an agreement was reached on giving the regional wage
boards the initial task of assessing the wage situation and make the
necessary adjustments. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#20:2>
A pay hike is usually based on the needs of the workers, the
prevailing wage levels, employers ' capacity to pay, productivity and its
effect on job generation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#21:2>
Agitation for a new round of wage increases came in the wake of
rising prices brought about by the devaluation of the peso and the ensuing
economic difficulties. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#22:2>
The President, who recognized the need for new wage adjustments,
directed Labor Secretary Leonardo Quisumbing in his capacity as chairman of
the National Wage and Productivity Commission, to ensure that the following
objectives are accomplished:

<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#23:2>
1) A complete review of the existing wages granted by the regional
wage boards and an expeditious action on all pending petitions for minimum
wage adjustments; and,

<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#24:2>
2) Based on established criteria and parameters, the determination of
appropriate wage adjustments and when these should be given, consistent with
developmental goals and people 's need. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#25:2>
While the purchasing power of the workers must be increased to
enable them to cope with the rising cost of living, it is incumbent on the
wage boards to assess the situation thoroughly so as not to stifle
productivity and government development goals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#26:2>
They must also consider the proposal of some companies to defer
wage increases at least till the end of the year, claiming that they cannot,
at this time, afford such wage adjustments because business is on the
downtrend. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#27:2>
Weighing carefully the pros and cons of the wage situation is no
easy task.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#28:2>
But it must be done.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#29:2>
And the regional wage boards must be allowed to do their work without
interruption from impatient and emotional NGOs, employees and other sectors.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#30:2>
After these boards shall have finished their work and decided on
the rates, all sectors must accept their decisions as the final ones.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#31:2>
Everyone must respect these decisions for the sake of industrial
peace and productivity.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#32:2>
Everyone must remember and realize that costs of living ( expenses)
vary from one province or city to another. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#33:2>
Residents of one urban center, or area, spend more ( or less)
than the other.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#34:2>
Thus, industrial workers must realize there can be no uniform minimum
wages.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#35:2>
They must not be influenced by emotional and unenlightened political
outbursts by demagogues. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> U.N. concern for RP 's plight </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#37:3>
AS ONE OF THE FEW democracies in the Asian continent, the
Philippines seems to stand out as a major United Nations concern as it
announced renewed efforts to revive its ailing economy from tremendous
challenges. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#38:3>
This was seen in the decision of various U.N. agencies in the
country to expand greater assistance to the Philippine economy to enable it
to achieve equitable human development and sustain economic growth. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#39:3>
Among these fresh forms of assistance are: 1) assisting workers
cope with rapidly changing labor market as a result of globalization, 2)
maintaining peace and enlarging economic opportunities in Mindanao, and 3)
assuring food security in the face of the <foreign> El Ni&ntilde;o </foreign>
phenomenon. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#40:3>
Speaking at simple ceremonies here marking the celebration of the
U.N. 's 52nd anniversary, U.N. System resident coordinator in the Philippines
Sarah L. Timpson said the times call for greater collaboration between the
U.N. and local societies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#41:3>
She cited new challenges, including new conflicts and new trends
in development which, she said, require a mix of global and local approaches
and strategies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#42:3>
<quote> &ldquo; The United Nations lives in the heart and mind of
every citizen striving to end violence and promote tolerance, advance
development and ensure equality, protect human rights and alleviate poverty,
&rdquo; </quote> she added. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#43:3>
Specifically, she disclosed that U.N. fresh priorities in the
Philippines include: 1) containing a population growth rate which erodes the
gains of growth, 2) strengthening the capabilities of small and medium scale
enterprises to compete in the international market, 3) securing the welfare
of children and women in families affected by migration and pressure of work,
4) stopping the plague of drug abuse and rising crime, 5) cleaning the air,
earth and water of dangerous levels of population and, 6) regenerating
damaged coral reefs, forests, soil, and marine resources. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#44:3>
Ms. Timpson voiced the hope that local societies will assist the
U.N. in developing capabilities of people and mobilizing resources to meet
new threats and seize new opportunities toward the next millennium. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#45:3>
The U.N. is the latest world institution to recognize the
economic plight of the Philippines and to pledge support to the country 's
economic dilemma. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#46:3>
With its free and democratic tradition, the U.N. cannot very well
allow another democracy to go under in the face of economic difficulties,
some of which are not of its own making. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> AIDS epidemic in Asia </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#48:4>
IN EXPRESSING ALARM over the rising tide of AIDS ( Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome) cases in Asia, President Ramos called for not
just <quote> &ldquo; expression of solidarity on paper" </quote> but <quote>
&ldquo; united action &rdquo; </quote> to prevent this scourge. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#49:4>
<quote> &ldquo; Clearly, the only recourse that nations can take
is to share experiences, learn from each other, and be united in an
unwavering commitment to combat AIDS, &rdquo; </quote> he said in a keynote
address before the International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific at
the Philippine International Convention Center. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#50:4>
Asia-Pacific countries, the President stressed, can no longer
leave the task of looking for AIDS solutions to the West, particularly the
United States where, he pointed out, more resources are being devoted to AIDS
research. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#51:4>
<quote> &ldquo; We in the Asia-Pacific could argue that the
conditions here could not produce sophisticated approaches since we could
hardly afford costly procedures and medicines prescribed to help people with
AIDS, &rdquo; </quote> the President emphasized.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#52:4>
<X> <quote> &ldquo; But we can match the resources and expertise of
the West by contributing to its prevention, maybe even the cure for AIDS.
&rdquo; </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#53:4>
If we have the will to do our share, we can certainly contribute
to AIDS prevention and hopefully, its cure, he added. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#54:4>
The President was right in raising the alarm because of
persistent reports that Asia, in a few years, will overtake Africa as the
area worst hit by the AIDS virus. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#55:4>
This was seen in the warning by a UN official who said that,
unless Asia wakes up and tackles squarely the AIDS threat, the region could
suffer a <quote> &ldquo; tragedy of historic proportions for Asia 's
billions. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#56:4>
This should come as no surprise because of the huge population of
Asian countries like China, India and Indonesia. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#57:4>
The UN estimated that seven million Asians, including between
three and five million people in India, may now be HIV carriers and the
number is expected to double by the year 2000. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#58:4>
Church groups like the Roman Catholic Church, which opposes the
use of condoms, should realize that they, too, have a stake in the fight.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#59:4>
When it is a matter of survival or death, it is difficult to imagine
that any religion would like to lose its followers because of this epidemic.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#60:4>
While we cannot expect church leaders to promote condoms, they
are expected not to put up obstacles. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#61:4>
An unchecked AIDS epidemic in Asia is likely to have a big impact
on the region 's economies in terms of huge medical costs, productivity
losses and loss of markets.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#62:4>
UN studies show that by the year 2005, Indonesia will be spending
more than one-third of its health budget on AIDS treatment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#63:4>
According to the same UN study, Cambodia, one of the countries
hardest hit by HIV with an estimated 17,000 cases this year, would also pay
heavily. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#64:4>
Clearly, implementing necessary preventive measures is <quote>
&ldquo; pretty soft investment that has to be made not as a matter of high
technology but one of partnership, education and making preventive measures
available, &rdquo; </quote> the President said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#65:4>
This appears to be the bottom line in the current fight against
the growing AIDS menace and this should be a basis for united action.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#66:4>
Prevention is the key to the current fight against AIDS and Asian
nations must never lose sight of it. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Not a go-signal for squatting </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#68:5>
A LAW, SIGNED the other day by President Ramos removing the
criminal liabilities of squatters, should not be mistaken as a go-signal for
squatting. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#69:5>
Apprehension over this is allayed by several provisions of the
law ( R.A. 8368), which still prescribes sanctions against so-called
professional squatters and squatting syndicates under the Urban and
Development Act ( R.A. 7279) and the Revised Penal Code. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#70:5>
The new law merely dismisses all court cases filed under
Presidential Decree 772 and sets free all those serving sentence for
violation of this martial law decree, which penalizes squatting and other
similar acts as a crime. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#71:5>
The new law also ends the indiscriminate demolition of squatters '
houses but by no means opens the floodgates to squatters. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#72:5>
The President said: <quote> &ldquo; The law must not be construed
as a go-signal for any squatter to pitch a tent or build a shanty on any
vacant piece of land, be it private or public in nature. &rdquo; </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#73:5>
In short, what the law means in decriminalizing squatting is
that, while it will uphold the social and human rights of the urban poor, it
will not diminish the legal protection afforded property owners. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#74:5>
Adequate protection is provided in the Revised Penal Code,
particularly Articles 281 and 312, which penalize any person who enters the
uninhabited premises of another or who, by means of violence, usurps any real
rights in property belonging to another. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#75:5>
It is clear that the law is principally intended to penalize
well-to-do &ldquo; squatters &rdquo; or squatting syndicates from occupying
private and public property such as <foreign> esteros </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2E-004#76:5>
The law is more of a social reform in that some four million people -
- men, women, children and elderly - - comprising around 10 percent of the
national population and 25 percent of the entire urban population will be
relieved of criminal liabilities. ... </p> </I>
