 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-057#61:3:A>
Good morning everyone welcome to another Prego portion of the
day and today we have a great dish we have dried salami with mushroom
macaroni
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-057#62:3:A>

very <indig> masarap </indig> and it 's super easy to make
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-057#63:3:A>
It 's not time-consuming at all and it 's just the best because you 're
using Prego
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-057#64:3:A>
Okay so we have here our uhm Prego and the Prego that we 're using
today is the Prego mushroom spaghetti sauce <indig> napakasarap po nito
 </indig> like all Prego products they 're the best
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-057#65:3:A>
You don't need to add anything you don't have to put anything
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-057#66:3:A>
All the ingredients are there you don't need to add salt pepper
whatever
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-057#67:3:A>
It 's super easy to make super fast and just terrific
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-057#68:3:A>
So we open it in their easy-open can and we put it in our pan there
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-057#69:3:A>
What I 'm gonna do is we 're gonna let that boil for a while by
mixing it with our wire whisk
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-057#70:3:A>
So I will add our cooked macaroni and I 'm just gonna add that
right here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-057#71:3:A>

If you can't find any salami you can use hotdog with this dish no
problem at all
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-057#78:3:A>
And then of course we have one bar of our Kraft cheesemelt cheese
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-057#79:3:A>
Now I love Kraft cheesemelt cheese because it melts while you 're
cooking
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-057#80:3:A>
So we use one bar or two hundred thirty-five grams of our cheese
okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-057#81:3:A>
And while that 's done I 'm gonna raise the fire a little bit more
and we 're just gonna toss these great ingredients here like so
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-057#82:3:A>
What we have right here is the finished product
