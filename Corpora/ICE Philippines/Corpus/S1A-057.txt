 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#17:1:B>
Then we talked about things

 <$A>

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#19:1:B>

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#21:1:B>
Uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#22:1:A>
Don't worry this is a <{> <[> I 'll make this </[> confidential

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#23:1:B>
<[> About our coming debate </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#24:1:A>
And then

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#25:1:B>
About

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#26:1:A>
Are you nervous with the debate

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#27:1:B>
Of course I am <,> who wouldn't be
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#28:1:B>
Especially as you said <indig> na </indig> especially when you said that the negative lost

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#29:1:A>
Really <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#30:1:B>
In your school

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#31:1:A>
Yeah the negative lost <,> then

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#32:1:B>
I realized this afternoon that I was not I wasn't the only one who planned to drink beer before the debate <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#33:1:A>
You 're going to drink first

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#34:1:B>
Yeah <,> to help me relax

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#35:1:A>
I guess that will not be good

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#36:1:B>
Why
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#37:1:B>
And it would <,> help me

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#38:1:A>
To loosen up

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#39:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#40:1:A>
That will not be good
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#41:1:A>
That 's not advisable actually 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#42:1:A>
Uh brandy would be much more preferable than beer because beer only smell <,> you know what
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#43:1:A>
Brandy is much much preferable because brandy is also as a kind of medicine

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#44:1:B>
Medicine

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#45:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#46:1:B>
Uh yeah <{> <[> <unclear> words </unclear> </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#47:1:A>
<[> To loosen up </[> </{> the nerves
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#48:1:A>
Rather than beer

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#49:1:B>
Then

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#50:1:A>
I hope you can make it with the debate

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#51:1:B>
I hope I will

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#52:1:A>
You 're that smart

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#53:1:B>
Uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#54:1:A>
Yes <,> you 're that smart
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#55:1:A>
You can make it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#56:1:A>
I 'm not pulling your leg I 'm not pulling your leg
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#58:1:A>

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#59:1:B>
Yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#60:1:A>
And nothing but the truth that 's it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#61:1:A>
I know you can make it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#62:1:B>
I cannot afford to lose
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#63:1:B>
I have to win because our grade will be based on that debate

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#64:1:A>
Is that so

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#65:1:B>
Oh yes it 's our final exam

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#66:1:A>
Uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#67:1:B>
We won't have any written exam

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#68:1:A>
Uh that will be good

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#69:1:B>
Good <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#70:1:A>
At least you 're not going to worry about the exam <,> the written exam anymore

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#71:1:B>
Well

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#72:1:A>
Unlike us we have so many reports
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#73:1:A>
We have so many term <.> par </.> papers and yet we 'll still have our written exam for the finals
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#74:1:A>
It 's quite tiring

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#75:1:B>
Will the whole class hear about this

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#76:1:A>
No <,,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#77:1:B>

Could you imagine that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#160:1:A>

You were the one who had to talk

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#170:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#171:1:A>
But you were not talking
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#172:1:A>
So I have to talk because this tape will be finished without our voices
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#173:1:A>

And then afterwards when I went home I was walking along the street <,> I met the the kid and then I heard some some some foul words

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#176:1:B>
Nasty remarks

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#177:1:A>
Nasty remarks about me and since I was I was so irritated yesterday I cried in front of Edwin and he asked me why what happened
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#178:1:A>
And I told him that Tom 's brother was was such nasty was such nasty was such a nasty guy and then uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#179:1:B>
You were talking outside your house

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#180:1:A>
No inside
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#181:1:A>
Uh Edwin dropped by at our place yesterday to inquire to inquire about my project if if I needed help

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#183:1:A>
Yeah Edwin is really a nice guy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#184:1:A>
He is like my shock absorber you know

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#185:1:B>
But I can't remember his face

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#186:1:A>
And then <,> yeah I talked to him about about Neil and the words he said about he lashed out about my character <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#187:1:A>
And I lost my patience
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#188:1:A>
I asked him to talk to talk about the behavior of his brother <,,> well that 's all

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#189:1:B>
He should have been reprimanded

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#190:1:A>
Yeah <,> and then we went to the church together with Tom
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#191:1:A>

And I told him that I got fed up with his brother because I don't have any link with <unclear> word </unclear> I don't have any <unclear> word </unclear> <{> <[> <,> </[> with them anymore and yet they were all nasty about me 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#196:1:B>
<[> I know you 're not </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#198:1:B>

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#199:1:A>
Yeah <,> he is my ex-boyfriend and yet I have I heard so many things he even wanted me back

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#200:1:B>
He 's got the nerve

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#201:1:A>
He asked me back

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#202:1:B>
<{> <[> He 's got the nerve </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#203:1:A>
<[> Can you believe that </[> </{> and yet I told him that uh you have to <.> rep </.> he had to reprimand his brother or else I 'm not going to talk to him anymore
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#204:1:A>
And then he told me that Neil Neil 's just jealous because Neil got a crush on me

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#205:1:B>
He 's just a boy

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#206:1:A>
Yeah he 's just a kid
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#207:1:A>
He 's only eleven years old
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#208:1:A>
And then hearing those words gosh it really made me feel so miserable
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#209:1:A>
Come on let 's forget about that day <indig> na lang </indig> <&> break in the recording </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#210:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#212:1:A>
So what about Amy

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#213:1:B>
I told her

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#214:1:A>
You told her what

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#215:1:B>
I 'm beginning to feel a great deal about her

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#216:1:A>
Then

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#217:1:B>
And then she just draped her arms around me
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#218:1:B>
She didn't say anything

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#219:1:A>
Don't tell me you 're <unclear> word </unclear> getting serious

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#220:1:B>
I don't know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#221:1:B>
What do you think

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#222:1:A>
I don't know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#223:1:A>
Just an advice don't get so serious about her <,> because <,> that will lead to nowhere
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#224:1:A>
<{> <[> You know what I mean </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#225:1:B>
<[> Yes I know </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#226:1:B>
I even invited her to go to <unclear> word </unclear> this semestral break

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#227:1:A>
Is she coming

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#228:1:B>
She said so

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#229:1:A>
You know what Arlene it is fun to to have a fling like that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#230:1:A>
I <.> ca </.> I can call it a fling because it is a fling right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#231:1:A>
But don't get too serious with with such a kind of relationship because it 's not normal
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#232:1:A>
And don't be don't be mad at me I 'm just telling the truth <,> okay

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#233:1:B>
She always occupies my

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#234:1:A>
Your thought

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#235:1:B>
Yes <,> what will I do

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#236:1:A>
What about Engel
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#237:1:A>
You 're going to see him <,> you 're going to see him this sem break right

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#238:1:B>
I guess I 'm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#239:1:A>
And <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#240:1:B>
Getting nervous

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#241:1:A>
Are you nervous about meeting Engel

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#242:1:B>
And the other one <,> <{> <[> hello </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#243:1:A>
<[> The other one </[> </{> Lucky

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#244:1:B>
No the other one
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#245:1:B>
You know who
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#246:1:B>
Don't mention his name

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#247:1:A>
Okay oh sure I 'm not going to mention his name

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#248:1:B>
But you know him

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#249:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#250:1:B>
I

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#251:1:A>
You 're such a <unclear> 1 word </unclear> girl <O> laughter </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#252:1:B>
I I know it 's wrong to expect to hope <,> to

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#253:1:A>
To hope about what

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#254:1:B>
To hope <.> tha </.> that things will be the same
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#255:1:B>
It 'll still be the same but I know

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#256:1:A>
If Amy will come to your place <,> you are going to introduce her to your high school friends right

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#257:1:B>
Yes <,> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#258:1:A>
<{> <[> Uhm </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#259:1:B>
<[> What </[> </{> am I going to tell them

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#260:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#261:1:B>
Nothing

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#262:1:A>
That you 're <.> ju </.> just friends <,> and that <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#263:1:B>
I am not <{> <[> even sure </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#264:1:A>
<[> Will they </[> </{> accept will they accept Amy <,> I mean the company

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#265:1:B>
Of course they will <,> they must I mean <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#266:1:A>
It is a must for them to accept Amy

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#267:1:B>
She 's my friend

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#268:1:A>
She is your friend they know

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#269:1:B>
I am their friend

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#270:1:A>
But don't give me that bullshit that she 's just a friend

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#271:1:B>
Ohhhppp <,> bullshit

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#272:1:A>
I said don't give me that bullshit

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#273:1:B>
That 's <unclear> 1 word </unclear> to say

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#274:1:A>
No it 's just <,> it is just an expression of mine though I know it 's not right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#275:1:A>
So it is not proper for me
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#276:1:A>
Ever since we transfer here in Metrica I 've learned to mention so many foul words
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#277:1:A>
I 've learned to use those foul words because of all my hang-ups <,> so you better <,> better ignore all those words and you better get used to it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#278:1:B>
I am used to it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#279:1:A>
You 're used to it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#280:1:B>
With all my friends in school

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#281:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#282:1:B>
Oh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#283:1:A>
I know you 're in a Catholic School as well

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#284:1:B>
Well

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#285:1:A>
<{> <[> Now </[> <O> laughter </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#286:1:B>
<[> Well </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#287:1:A>
Now what will you do this sem break

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#288:1:B>
This sem break <,> uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#289:1:A>
Yeah
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#290:1:A>
Will you go swimming together with Amy and together with <,> with Engel

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#291:1:B>
Uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#292:1:A>
Will you stay at the will you stay at the resort or will will you stay at the beach house of your friend

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#293:1:B>
I want to ask you something

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#294:1:A>
What

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#295:1:B>
Are you happy with your life now

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#296:1:A>
I 'm not happy with my life <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#297:1:A>
Yes I can say that I am contented with my life but I 'm not that happy with my life
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#298:1:A>
You know what I mean <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#299:1:A>
There 's still an emptiness within me which I cannot see what it is
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#300:1:A>
<unclear> words </unclear> I 'm still searching <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#301:1:B>
But in your condition of course you know what you want

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#302:1:A>
As of now I 'm not so sure I 'm not so sure of the future
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#303:1:A>
I 'm not so sure of my plans <,,> especially especially of all those things that happened with me these past few months

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#304:1:B>
You know I envy those people especially my classmates who already have plans after they graduate from college

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#305:1:A>
What are their plans
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#306:1:A>
What are their plans

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#307:1:B>
As usual <,> go into mass media

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#308:1:A>
But isn't it such a bore to <,> to plan your life ahead
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#309:1:A>
Anyway it is good to have definite plans but <,> that will be so dull
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#310:1:A>
If you simply <,> if you simply <.> fo </.> follow the pattern of your life <,> of your life that you want it to be <{> <[> then you won't have to </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#311:1:B>
<[> It is much more </[> </{> thrilling
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#312:1:B>
But then you went you won't have to get to be worried <,> <{> <[> for the </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#313:1:A>
<[> Worried about what </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#314:1:A>
About the future

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#315:1:B>
Yes <,> if you plan ahead

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#316:1:A>
For me it is quite a bore
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#317:1:A>
I don't know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-057#318:1:A>
It 's just that <,> I take life as as it is you know although I have plans for the future it 's just that I don't want those plans to run my my present life because it will ruin me
