<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#1:1:A>
Uh thank you Dr Quirino
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#2:1:A>
Uh before I begin uh let me thank uh first of all FUSE for extending
this invitation for us to disseminate to you the results of our <.> re </.> 
research for the past seven months and of course <indig> Doktora </indig> 
Cortes uh the President of U E who was the one who recommended me to FUSE
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#3:1:A>
So let 's begin
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#4:1:A>
The one you see uh in front of you this is an aerial photo of uh
Manila taken in nineteen ninety-six
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#5:1:A>
Our project area is that uh area
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#6:1:A>
So let 's begin with the title
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#7:1:A>
The title of our project is <mention> Potential Initiatives for
Urban Renewal of the University Belt in the City of Manila </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#8:1:A>
As you can see this was funded by the U E Foundation for Research
and Advanced Study through a grant from PAGCOR
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#9:1:A>
May I may I at this point introduce my co-study leader uh who 's
right at the center Environmental Planner Joel Oa&ntilde;a
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#10:1:A>
So uh I think the word <mention> urban renewal </mention> has to be
defined here what we mean
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#11:1:A>
This is really a development approach that aims to have a
revitalization of the urban environment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#12:1:A>
And what is very critical here is community participation to be
able to ensure sustainability
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#13:1:A>
So let me go over very quickly the objectives of the study
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#14:1:A>
First we looked at what are the problems and issues and concerns in
this area particularly in the context of urban renewal public-private
partnership and community governance
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#15:1:A>
And then based on an understanding of what these problems issues
and concerns are we proceeded to have uh to draw up a preliminary area
development framework
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#16:1:A>
This led to the identification of the development initiatives
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#17:1:A>
When we say <mention> initiatives </mention> these are the some of
the proposed programs and projects that may be implemented in this area
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#18:1:A>
So we also looked at what development schemes and policies uh that
we could introduce to be able to have a renewal of the University Belt and
finally it uh aims to create awareness that 's why we have this dissemination
phase and possible partnerships particularly among the stakeholders in this
area
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#19:1:A>
So uh what would be the study area
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#20:1:A>
This is our study area actually
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#21:1:A>
It 's composed of six blocks covering fifteen hectares we begin
with Legarda going to Claro Recto Nicanor Reyes or Morayta P Campa then
Tortosa and M V de los Santos
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#22:1:A>
We 'd like to clarify that the University Belt is very very large
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#23:1:A>
And because of the largeness of the area we needed to have a pilot
area of six blocks which is a doable area to demonstrate that the private
sector can come in and be involved in this
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#24:1:A>
This is about thirty-seven percent of the land area of Zone
forty-one and this falls within the fourth district of Manila
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#25:1:A>
Now our conceptual framework uh there there are three essential
elements of urban renewal
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#26:1:A>
That 's place people and partnership
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#27:1:A>
To be able to understand the place we did an area resource
assessment and we will present the findings to understand the the capability
of the people to undertake urban renewal
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#28:1:A>
We did an area capability assessment and based on an understanding
of place and people we proceeded to identify what kinds of partnership may
come about
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#29:1:A>
And as you can see the word <mention> effectiveness </mention> is
in red uh that really means to say that to be able to have a successful urban
renewal it is it is really premised on having effective partnerships on the
ground among the stakeholders
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#30:1:A>
So what are the findings
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#31:1:A>
We did the study uh in terms of a survey of students of U E which
is about a large sample uh survey the these are the three major uh there will
be three major streets that will be shown to you
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#32:1:A>
So what did the students say
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#33:1:A>
How did they describe the area
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#34:1:A>
In the order of description based on the most frequent frequently
given answer <,> first it 's dangerous then it 's dirty it 's disorderly for
the following reasons there are many criminal elements there 's an L R T two
construction on-going there are just too many people who are loitering aloun
around there 's a lot of garbage dilapidated buildings inefficient drainage
leading to flooding there 's congestion of traffic unsystematic parking and
basically noisy environment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#35:1:A>
We proceeded to ask about other streets that are vital F Dalupan
was asked this is Gastambide the old name
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#36:1:A>
The same thing emerged in the order of <.> preferen </.> in the
order of frequency of answers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#37:1:A>
It was described as dirty disorderly displeasing to the eye almost
similar reasons given
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#38:1:A>
And the third one is S H Loyola this is the former Lepanto and R
Papa
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#39:1:A>
Again they said this place is dangerous dirty and disorderly
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#40:1:A>
These are alarming answers coming from the major uh population who
are frequenting the area which would be the students
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#41:1:A>
Based on this let us uh we tried to validate whether there 's any
basis for the students to say this or to describe the area
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#42:1:A>
So we did part of the area resource assessment is a physical and
visual resource assessment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#43:1:A>
So what did we find here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#44:1:A>
We looked at it from both good and bad side
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#45:1:A>
As you can see we 're <.> say </.> saying there are arcaded
sidewalks like these
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#46:1:A>
They represent very unique urban spatial character
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#47:1:A>
You don't always see these arcaded walkways in other cities
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#48:1:A>
But then what do we see under these uh uh arcaded walkways
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#49:1:A>
We see sidewalk vendors uh that are in the area we see breaks in
the arcaded walkways so you get wet when you cross from one building to the
other
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#50:1:A>
So basically there 's non- adherence of some buildings to the
design of the uh as given in this area
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#51:1:A>
But then we looked at also are there historical sites here no
matter how dilapidated the area is
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#52:1:A>
We did find some historical sites
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#53:1:A>
This is <foreign> La Gota de Leche </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#54:1:A>
This is a <,> old old building nineteen O six which was used before
as a feeding center and still continues to be one today and uh as you can see
it is in a state requiring a lot of restoration and adaptive re-use
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#55:1:A>
This is found along Lepanto
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#56:1:A>
Now walkways
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#57:1:A>
We looked at the walkways
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#58:1:A>
There are there 's really no unifying design they 're all different
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#59:1:A>
Now in terms of landscaping you can see some have trees some are
waste baskets already and some are just grasses
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#60:1:A>
This is the state of the area
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#61:1:A>
Now uh because of the lack of public spaces where students can
congregate they tend to go of course to the shopping mall which is Ever
Gotesco and fast food chains like McDonalds Jollibee and Chowking
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#62:1:A>
So there 's really no open spaces or public parks where they can
congregate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#63:1:A>
Now we did a pedestrian count
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#64:1:A>
We actually fielded counters on a straight eleven-hour basis just
to find out how many people are walking in the streets
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#65:1:A>
Claro Recto has uhm about twenty-nine thousand eight hundred one
people or pedestrians uh followed by R Papa which connects F E U and U E and
where you have P S B A and other schools about over twenty-five thousand and
Nicanor Reyes or Morayta which has about over twenty-five thousand
pedestrians at any given date of a straight eleven-hour
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#66:1:A>
You can see that in the morning in rush <.> mor </.> uh rush hour
in the morning between eight and ten
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#67:1:A>
R Papa has the heaviest pedestrian movement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#68:1:A>
And therefore you the reason I 'm giving stress to R Papa is
because we have program recommendations for R Papa which connects a lot of
schools
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#69:1:A>
Now there 's another major uh thing there which is on-going the
construction of L R T two
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#70:1:A>
This is the old Sampaloc uh site which will be the L R T two
station
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#71:1:A>
So it really cuts across and that 's the reason why the students
are saying that this is really basically disorderly because of the
construction and this will be operational by two thousand four
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#72:1:A>
Next to the Sampaloc market the next station will be the old
Bilibid Prison <.> a </.> across Quezon Boulevard
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#73:1:A>
Now what about the traffic
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#74:1:A>
You can see those big areas
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#75:1:A>
This is where you have the choke points and choke points are caused
by indiscriminated indiscriminate loading and unloading queuing of <indig> 
jeepneys </indig> at intersections
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#76:1:A>
There 's also narrow turning points like in this Lerma junction and
of course uh pedestrians dash across the streets so they don't get run down
plus of course <indig> pedicabs </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#77:1:A>
So this is a concern which is uh validated when the students say
that it 's really quite dangerous to cross and a disorderly set up
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#78:1:A>
Now there 's also flooding there 's also as as seen in this picture
and also seismic hazards because this is very close to the Quiapo Santa Cruz
area which is a high risk area for earthquakes
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#79:1:A>
The U-Belt really is uh because of the population size that
traverse it is a high solid waste generator
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#80:1:A>
As you can see uh in this area this is a common sight where you
have these kinds of uh environmental problems
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#81:1:A>
Now we looked at the economic resource assessment as well and uh
let us let me share with you the findings
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#82:1:A>
We did an actual establishment survey actually counting business
establishments
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#83:1:A>
And there are about three hundred thirty-six uh business
establishments the largest is services
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#84:1:A>
And this is understandable because they cater uh to principally to
the students
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#85:1:A>
Now in terms of the sidewalk vendors we call them the informal
vendors they 're about hundred forty-one and they 're largely selling food
and the others plus of course services like those uh of repair key
duplication
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#86:1:A>
What 's the implication of this
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#87:1:A>
Uhm when we looked at the establishments both registered and
unregistered and we just looked at the universities along Claro Recto the
ratio is very high
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#88:1:A>
There are about thirty-four establishments per hectare and about
seventeen establishments per educational institution which means instead of
having a dominant educational character in this area because of the presence
of so many schools what is dominant is the commercial character
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#89:1:A>
So there has to be a bit of a balance
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#90:1:A>
We 're not saying we should remove commercial but it should be a
bit more balanced than what it is today
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#91:1:A>
Socio-cultural resource assessment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#92:1:A>
So we looked at the people uh in the area and then we looked at the
establishments
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#93:1:A>
Here is a very interesting thing
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#94:1:A>
The University Belt is very important
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#95:1:A>
It 's historically significant because this is where the pioneers
of tertiary education chose to locate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#96:1:A>
Starting in nineteen O one with San Beda and La Consolacion
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#97:1:A>
This is the Mendiola side
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#98:1:A>
Across the bridge from Mendiola you have the non-sectarian schools
came about starting with the University of Manila in nineteen thirteen in
nineteen twenty-eight with F E U and U E in nineteen forty-six
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#99:1:A>
So really uh there is a lot of justification for having this
renewed because of that historical significance in terms of tertiary
education
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#100:1:A>
Now furthermore uh when you see this area in terms of
socio-cultural we found out that the resident population is very small
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#101:1:A>
It 's roughly only about six thousand
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#102:1:A>
And we 're talking only of the pilot area not the entire
University Belt
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#103:1:A>
And then uh there are about in the tertial tertiary level about
hundred thousand transient tertiary students who don't live there <indig> no
 </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#104:1:A>
Uh this is only considering eight colleges and universities
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#105:1:A>
So what 's the implication the of this
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#106:1:A>
Having a very small resident population which is serving a very
large number of students who are not in fact their students they 're not
economically active
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#107:1:A>
The implication is there 's a very high social service and
infrastructure burden imposed on the residents and local legitimate business
through the tax system
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#108:1:A>
And you 're talking of garbage uh collection police protection
traffic management road repair and improvement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#109:1:A>
So what 's the consequence of this heavy burden
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#110:1:A>
When cost and capacity to pay for such services do not match
coupled with the very highly dense daytime population you would expect that
without serious efforts on the part of different sectors you will have a
deterioration in the quality of urban services
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#111:1:A>
So you have garbage you have traffic you have flooding
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#112:1:A>
This is almost an automatic consequence of that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#113:1:A>
So what can we what can we do actually
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#114:1:A>
Uh this is the challenge that the researches pose
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#115:1:A>
Because of the importance of the educational sector in the history
of the University Belt the challenge then to the affected universities is to
take a more active role in the <.> u </.> in the renewal of the urban
environment where they operate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#116:1:A>
And here you have six universities and colleges
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#117:1:A>
A Advance Academy now has a new name
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#118:1:A>
It 's called Saint John Bosco Computer School very recently it has
a change in name
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#119:1:A>
The challenge translates to having the community partnering with
the government to bringing about a better quality of life in the U-Belt
particularly for the students and the rest of the academic community
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#120:1:A>
There 's a further justification of why we should move
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#121:1:A>
Because as we have uh as I have shown to you there are historical
assets here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#122:1:A>
There are also century-old institutions here like <foreign> 
Colegio Medico Farmaceutico de Filipinas </foreign> University of Manila the
P U P Rizal campus
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#123:1:A>
These have been recognized by the National Historic Institute and
are already reflected in the historical markers book of the N H I
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#124:1:A>
Therefore we 're saying preservation of the culture and heritage
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-041#125:1:A>
And this becomes another major argument for urban renewal in the
University Belt </I> 1
