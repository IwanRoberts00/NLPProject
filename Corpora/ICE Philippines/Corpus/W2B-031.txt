HONG KONG - -

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#4:1>
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em -- at least for the time being. </p>

<p> With more than 120 million subscribers worldwide, third generation ( 3G)
digital wireless communications based on the Code Division Multiple Access (
CDMA) platform is now firmly established and continues to grow at a
phenomenal rate, so says the CDMA Development Group ( CDG) that organized the
3G World Congress held last week at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition
Centre. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#5:1>
<quote> &ldquo; CDMA continues to expand rapidly around the world
and is leading in 3G adoption, &rdquo; </quote> beams Perry La Forge,
executive director of CDG.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#6:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The subscriber demand for wireless data connectivity
continues to increase and opens new opportunities for service providers and
manufacturers. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#7:1>
But even with this encouraging development, Qualcomm, the company
that pioneered CDMA technology, is determined to make inroads in territories
where2G systems based on the Global System for Mobile communications ( GSM)
standard remain in place.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#8:1>
GSM remains the dominant platform for mobile communications, with some
680 million subscribers worldwide from mostly European and Asian countries,
the Philippines included. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#9:1>
Qualcomm, which supplies both hardware and software technology to
3G mobile communications vendors, has announced multi-platform solutions
which it hopes would ultimately lead to full 3G migration. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#10:1>
These include chipset solutions like the MSM6200, the MGP6200
Multimode Global Positioning System ( GPS) and system software and the
radioOne 6300, which will bridge 2G and 3G technologies on GSM, and GPRS (
general packet radio system). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#11:1>
There 's also the new BREW ( Binary Runtime Environment for
Wireless) software application platform that can run on both CDMA and GSM
hardware and further enhance their capabilities while sitting on top of other
similar technologies like Java and running unobtrusively in the background.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#12:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Although the 3G direction which the vast majority
of carriers are taking throughout the world is CDMA ( either CDMA2000 or
W-CDMA), the strategy to recognize that GSM networks and subscribers will be
around for some time is a reflection of our commitment to provide users with
3G capabilities, with the ability to roam anywhere in the world, &rdquo;
</quote> says Marshall Towe Jr., managing director of Qualcomm Southeast
Asia. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#13:1>
Towe acknowledges that even as many parts of the world are now
enjoying the unsurpassed user experience that only 3G can provide,
particularly Korea where CDMA is now prevalent, GSM strongholds are not
likely to make the switch overnight. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#14:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The convergence from GSM to CDMA will take time
and full convergence to 3G is still years away, &rdquo; </quote> he concedes.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#15:1>
<quote> &ldquo; In the meantime, the 3G capability ( of
GSM-compatible products) bridges the gap. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#16:1>
Even as Qualcomm is coming up with such multi-platform solutions
to penetrate the GSM market, Towe disclosed that the company remains firm in
its commitment to bring 3G technology everywhere in the world via theCDMA2000
and W-CDMA platforms.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#17:1>
Qualcomm is particularly keen on rolling out 3G service in the
Philippines, which Towe describes as <quote> &ldquo; an awesome, strong
market, very Western in many ways and without language issues. &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#18:1>
<quote> &ldquo; We would like to work with one of the existing
800-MHz operators in your country to roll out 3G service thru CDMA2000 in the
very near future, &rdquo; </quote> Towe enthuses.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#19:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The success of Korea, United States, Japan and now
many other countries shows that this technology can be of great benefit to
the consumers and allows operators a very cost-effective and efficient way to
quickly and easily roll out 3G services. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#20:1>
Towe also points out that building blocks are already in place to
make 3G an immediate reality in the Philippines, although Qualcomm still
needs to work out some issues with network providers and government
regulating agencies like the National Telecommunications Commission.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#21:1>
He notes that the country still has a small CDMA system from Piltel
in place with some 50,000 subscribers and identifies both Piltel and another
network provider, sister company Smart, as mobile operators that are capable
of doing 3G right now. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#22:1>
As demonstrated in several keynote speeches and roundtable
discussions during the Hong Kong congress, 3G in its present commercial
incarnation is by far the most advanced form of mobile communications
technology available today.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#23:1>
Wireless devices powered by Qualcomm chip sets and BREW technology
like cellular handsets, personal digital assistants and modem cards are
loaded with such features as high-speed Internet access, global roaming,
crystal-clear voice quality, symphonic ringing tones, high-resolution color
displays, built-in digital cameras, streaming video and MP3 players,
downloadable multimedia games and other applications. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#24:1>
One compelling application is position location services, which
can either help prevent a user from getting lost in a certain vicinity with
the help of an interactive onscreen map or easily follow and track down the
location of anyone or more given companions within a five-meter radius. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#25:1>
Towe believes this application is just one of the many 3G
technologies that are likely to become popular with Filipino consumers when
3G finally takes off in the country. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Treo takes on Nokia 9210 </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#27:2>
<bold> By JV Rufino </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#28:2>
FOR quite a while now I have been using the Handspring Treo 180 -
- Handspring 's latest attempt to merge a cellular phone with a PDA - - as my
primary phone to see how well it copes with the rigors of day-to-day use and
how it compares with the Nokia 9210 Communicator, Nokia 's take on the
phone-PDA hybrid. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#29:2>
First off, both products show the heritage of their makers,
<foreign> i.e. </foreign> , PDA manufacturer or phone manufacturer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#30:2>
<mention> Handspring </mention> was formed by the original team
that made the first <mention> Palm </mention> and their expertise shows.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#31:2>
As a PDA, the Treo is better than the Communicator.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#32:2>
The Treo 's Palm OS-based PDA applications are more intuitive than
their counterparts on the Communicator and the Treo is more stable ( the
Communicator needing more than the occasional reset).

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#33:2>
On the other hand, the Communicator doesn't need a stylus, relying
instead on gamepad-like cursor pad.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#34:2>
Although it takes getting used to, at least with the Communicator you
don't have to worry about losing a stylus in the middle of a busy day.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#35:2>
And its screen is colored to the Treo 's monochrome. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#36:2>
On the other hand, the Treo is clunkier as a phone.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#37:2>
Battery life, voice quality, reception and volume are not as good as
that of the Communicator ( though not exceptionally bad either), since Nokia
knows how to make phones. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#38:2>
The integration of the Address Book with SMS and e-mail is also
better on the Communicator than on the Treo.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#39:2>
On the Treo, SMS and e-mail are separate applications and if you want
to send a fax you 'll need a third-party program.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#40:2>
SMS, e-mail and faxes are all stored in a single application on the
Communicator - - a more elegant way of keeping track of who said what to whom
( the situation is reversed when it comes to surfing, the Communicator having
one browser for Wap and another for the Web while the Treo 's Blazer browser
displays both HTML and WAP pages). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#41:2>
This isn't to say that the Treo doesn't have some nice touches as
a phone.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#42:2>
My favorite is the dedicated switch that places the phone on silent
mode.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#43:2>
Definitely better than going through the Nokia Profiles menu when you
need to squelch the ringer fast such as when in a movie house or church.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#44:2>
The rocker switch on the left side also proves handy though it took a
bit of experimenting to figure out how to use it to its full potential.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#45:2>
And the Treo is a lot handier than the Communicator, which has never
been famous for being dainty ( the price though is you forego the
Communicator 's roomy keyboard and have to make do with the Treo 's &ldquo;
thumb-board &rdquo; which for its size is surprisingly comfortable for
sending short text messages). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#46:2>
So which one should you go for?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#47:2>
Like all things in computing, it depends on what you want.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#48:2>
If sheer features and the phone part of the equation are vital to
you, then go for the Communicator.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#49:2>
If your needs gravitate more toward the PDA side, then go for Treo.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#50:2>
You should also go for the Treo if size is a problem ( the size of
phone I mean). </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#54:3>
Have you ever thought that someday information can be obtained on
demand?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#55:3>
Recent developments in information technology have made it possible
to connect the Philippines throughout the world. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#56:3>
When William &ldquo; Bill &rdquo; Gates II, Microsoft Chairman
and CEO, visited the Philippines just recently he spoke of the critical role
governments play in propelling the nation towards a <it> connected community
</it> - - an information network that connects citizens, businesses,
government agencies, service companies, and schools.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#57:3>
He also foretold the development of the Digital Nervous System ( DNS)
which would someday eliminate paperwork, reduce bureaucracy, and enhance
learning. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#58:3>
With the current deregulation of the telecommunication industry,
various companies are welcoming the Filipino clientele to a world where time
and space are no longer barriers for communication.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#59:3>
Products of progress such as cellular telephones and pagers, optical
fibers, multimedia computers, and the Internet are capable of delivering
quality services tailored to the needs of the consumers. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#60:3>
<h> <bold> Cellular wonders </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#61:3>
Cellular telephones or cell phones were introduced in the early
1980s.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#62:3>
In this system, a city or a district is broken into a series of <it>
cells </it> , each is equipped with its own central transmitter-receiver.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#63:3>
These cells are technically arranged to handle different frequencies,
though the same frequency can be used throughout the system.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#64:3>
For instance, as a car or a person moves from one cell to the next,
the call remains active and continues. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#65:3>
Cell phones began as analog devices with AMPS or Advanced Mobile
Phone System as the analog standard.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#66:3>
Today, powerful and more efficient digital cellular systems are being
introduced to the public.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#67:3>
Notable among these are the proven GSM or Global System for Mobile
Communication and the emerging CDMA or the Code Division Multiple Access.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#68:3>
Both systems are capable of delivering clear calls, text messaging,
data transmission, caller ID, and clone protection aside from other
top-of-the-line features. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#69:3>
<h> <bold> Beeps of boon </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#70:3>
Developments in radio technology paved for the introduction of
the beeper.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#71:3>
The device is activated when it receives a special radio signal.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#72:3>
Before, most of the people who own beepers are in the medical
profession.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#73:3>
In an emergency situation, they can be easily notified.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#74:3>
As the prices of beepers roll down with features on the upswing, even
ordinary students can afford to maintain a pager.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#75:3>
With the group paging feature, it is possible for a sales office to
notify all its sales executives of an emergency meeting all at the same time.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#76:3>
At present several paging companies offer valuable paging
services to its sub-scribers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#77:3>
These include news, stock market reports, traffic updates, voice mail
services, and even e-mail ( electronic mail) paging. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#78:3>
On the hardware side, beepers have evolved from being stand-alone
alpha-numeric message receivers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#79:3>
The latest generation of pagers has multiple alert tones, time and
date stamping capability, auto on/off functions, caller ID, and other
innovative features. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#80:3>
<h> <bold> Fibers of light </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#81:3>
There are many modes of transmitting a telephone call.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#82:3>
One is through copper wire, which transmits calls in the form of
electronic impulses.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#83:3>
Then, there is the microwave, which transforms the call into radio
waves.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#84:3>
Satellite communication is a development of microwave used for
intercontinental relay of messages. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#85:3>
In the early 1980s, the supremacy of the satellite and microwave
was challenged with the entry of fiber optics.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#86:3>
In fiber optic communication, the message is translated into light
impulses, which travel into extremely thin glass fibers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#87:3>
Theoretically, a single strand of fiber optics, which is about the
same proportion as the human hair, has the capacity of handling millions of
telephone conversations with a far better quality than the copper-line
counterpart.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#88:3>
Optical fibers provide a state-of-the-art communication channel for
those who demand information at the fastest way.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#89:3>
To facilitate cross-country fiber optic communication, submarine
cables are laid in the bottom of the sea. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#90:3>
<h> <bold> Surfing without the waves </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#91:3>
What!

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#92:3>
Surfing without waves and surfboards?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#93:3>
Yes!

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#94:3>
It is possible, but to do that you need a modem-equipped computer, a
telephone line, and a subscription with an Internet service provider ( ISP).
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#95:3>
The Internet or information superhighway is the network of all
computer networks.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#96:3>
<mention> <it> Netizens </it> </mention> , as the Internet surfers
are called, may send and receive E-mails ( electronic mails) around the world
faster than postal mail; browse through academic and corporate databases;
settle business transactions; shop in a virtual mall; play games; and chat
from someone in another country without paying international call charge.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#97:3>
What we now know as the <mention> Internet </mention> is actually
an evolution of the military network called <mention> ARPAnet </mention> (
Advanced Research Projects Agency network) formed in 1970 by the US
Department of Defense.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#98:3>
Also in the 1970s, the network was opened to non-military agencies
such as universities and companies doing defense related research.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-031#99:3>
In the 1980s, the marvel of the Internet gained momentum and soon
most universities and numerous business establishments around the world
started connecting to it. </p> </I>
