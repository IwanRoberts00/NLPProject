Dear Dr. Tish Bautista,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#6:1>
Ms. Marjorie Evasco has recommended you to represent De La Salle
in a pilot meeting of an organizing committee for the possible formation of a
Philippine chapter of the English-Speaking Union. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#7:1>
Dr. Gemino H. Abad of UP, FEU Chair Dr. Lourdes Montinola,
possibly Ophie Dimalanta of UST, and I will be hosted for a lunch-meet by Dr.
Isabel Martin and Marlu Vilches at 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday, Dec. 19 at the
English Department of Ateneo de Manila University.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#8:1>
Sorry for this late communication, but I do hope you can join us. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#9:1>
Below I reproduce the initial communication I posted to the group.

11 December 2001

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#13:1>
Dear Friends,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#14:1>
A little over a fortnight ago, I had the opportunity to pay a
courtesy call, together with fellow writers Dr. Beni Santos, Mr. Rio Almario,
Mr. Edgar Maranan, and Philippine Ambassador to the United Kingdom Cesar
Bautista, on Ms. Valerie Mitchell, OBE, Director General of the
English-Speaking Union.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#15:1>
It was Ms. Loline Reed of the Overseas Women 's Club, and a leading
light of the Filipino Women 's Association, who arranged the call.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#16:1>
The English-Speaking Union has been at the forefront of efforts to
propagate, promote and enhance English-language use throughout the world.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#17:1>
It has chapters from practically all of the American states and UK 's
geographical units, as well as 42 countries.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#18:1>
The latest chapters to be incorporated are those of Hong Kong and
Thailand, for which reason Ms. Mitchell was scheduled to lead an official
party to visit those countries for their formal rites of integration into
ESU.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#19:1>
The wonder of it, as we expressed to Ms. Mitchell, is that the
Philippines has yet to be represented in the Union.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#20:1>
Neither are Singapore and Malaysia represented, for that matter.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#21:1>
Ms. Mitchell took pains to explain that chapter membership is granted
after an 18-month process from the time a potential country chapter expresses
its desire to join up, and initiates efforts for the purpose.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#22:1>
These efforts begin with the formation of an organizing committee.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#23:1>
In the case of the Philippines, as a result of the positive meeting
we had with Ms. Mitchell, who proved quite gracious and all-too-receptive to
the idea of a Philippines chapter, we were advised to take the initiative to
form this committee as soon as possible.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#24:1>
This organizing committee - - with a membership of anywhere from five
to nine people, in our case predominantly from the academe as we suggested,
should at some point include the Director of The British Council in Manila,
and eventually, as recommended by Mrs. Mitchell, the Cultural Affairs officer
of the U.S. Embassy.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#25:1>
The first important task of this committee would be to conduct a
local competition among the students of our major educational institutions to
determine the selection of one or two representatives to the International
Public Speaking Competition for the year 2002, to be held in London by May.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#26:1>
We can have one official candidate - age between 16 and 19 as I
understand it - - to be hosted by the ESU at Dartmouth House, its official
building, while the other representative will be granted a homestay program
as an observer and/or alternate candidate.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#27:1>
I believe they will also be granted stipends.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#28:1>
What we will have to raise is the funding for their flight tickets.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#29:1>
For this purpose, it has been suggested by Ms. Mitchell that we
eventually transform the organizing committee to a formal one with membership
offered to certain businessmen or well-placed individuals, either in business
or government.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#30:1>
If I recall correctly, Ambassador Bautista suggested having Executive
Secretary Alberto Romulo, who enjoys wide-ranging relations within the UK,
eventually join the official committee once it 's ready for actual
incorporation.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#31:1>
Mrs. Mitchell stressed however that it is essential to form the
informal, organizing committee immediately, so that it can serve as the
selection committee for the two Philippine representatives to the public
speaking contest, as well as name two other possible delegates - - one from
academe and one from media - - to two other separate conferences sponsored by
the ESU in June and July 2002.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#32:1>
Mrs. Mitchell also gave us a couple of videotapes - - one on the ESU
and the other on the workings of the public speaking contest - - so that we
can get a better idea of both.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#33:1>
Now I 'd like to ask you to join the organizing committee for the
formation of the Philippines chapter of the English-Speaking Union.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#34:1>
Off the bat, I believe that the major educational institutions such
as Ateneo de Manila University, De La Salle University, Far Eastern
University, University of the Philippines and University of Santo Tomas
should be represented in this organizing committee.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#35:1>
Potential members - - depending on their willingness and availability
- - include, apart from the undersigned, the following:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#36:1>
( 1) Isabel Martin, Chair, English Dept., Ateneo de Manila

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#37:1>
( 2) Ma. Luz C. Vilches, Executive Director, Ateneo Center for
English Language Teaching

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#38:1>
( 3) Marjorie Evasco, Director, Bienvenido N. Santos Creative Writing
Center, De La Salle

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#39:1>
( 4) Lourdes Montinola, Chair, Far Eastern University

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#40:1>
( 5) Gemino H. Abad, University Professor, University of the
Philippines

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#41:1>
( 6) Ophelia A. Dimalanta, Director, UST Center for Creative Writing
& Studies </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#42:1>
Perhaps we can all meet soon at a time and place convenient for
all of us.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#43:1>
I would like to request Dr. Martin and Dr. Vilches to arrange for a
venue at Ateneo de Manila where we can have a lunch-meeting and take time to
view the two VHS tapes.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#44:1>
We can decide to either invite the incoming British Council Director
to this initial meeting or defer her participation to a subsequent meeting.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#45:1>
I realize that the round of Christmas socials is increasingly getting
frenzied, so that we might not find a common time, date and place convenient
for all.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#46:1>
But it is important that we get to have our first meeting before the
holidays, so that we can discuss how best to organize the contest among the
students of the represented schools by late January, and report back to the
ESU by that time, and inform them of the availability of our candidates. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#47:1>
May I then suggest a lunch meeting sometime this week, say
Thursday, December 13, or Friday, December 14, barring which we can also
schedule it for next week, say Tuesday, December 18?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#48:1>
Please recommend alternative dates and venues. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#49:1>

Dear Friends,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#91:3>
Here 's the latest communication from London re our efforts, from
ESU as well as the Philippine Embassy there.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#92:3>
The messages below include the tentative program schedule for the
IPSC, or International Public Speaking Competition.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#93:3>
These are particularly addressed to Ryan Buenafe and Mahar Mangahas,
our two winners who will represent the Philippines in London in May. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#94:3>
Miriam, the coordinates you gave me for Ryan don't seem to work.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#95:3>
I 've tried contacting him twice through both the cellphone number
and the e-mail addy, but gained no response on both occasions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#96:3>
Marlu, I 'll e-mail you the names and addresses of individuals
and institutions to who we 're addressing our letters of funding
solicitation.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#97:3>
I 'll try to do these tomorrow, Sunday, or Monday at the latest in
the case of the airlines, whose PR managers I still have to find out.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#98:3>
In the event that we receive no suggestions for emendation from Gill
by Monday, I suggest you have the two versions printed out on the stationery
you made, so they can be disseminated by Tuesday, April 16 at the latest.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-017#99:3>
At that, we barely have a fortnight to generate any positive
response. </p>
