 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#13:1:D>
Uh yes Mr Speaker

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#14:1:C>
Thank you Mr Speaker
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#15:1:C>
Uh Mr Speaker <,> uh I 'm in support of this Bill but uh on uh a
qualified basis Mr Speaker <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#16:1:C>
I 'm also a member of the uh Ways and Means Committee
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#17:1:C>
Now my question is uh Your Honor <,> uh will this uh increased rate
be a permanent fixture in our national Internal Revenue Code

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#18:1:D>
Does the gentleman refer to the the proposed increase in the
excise tax on all the items enumerated in the Bill

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#19:1:C>
Uh yes Your Honor

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#20:1:D>
Yes, Your Honor <{> <[> there is </[> no proviso here that
states otherwise <,,> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#21:1:C>
<[> Uh </[> </{> in other words Your Honor uh this uh
increased rate will forever be in the Internal Revenue Code <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#22:1:C>
Mr Speaker uh <,> this Bill uh represents what I think is uh <,,> a
uh <,> measure imposing uh <,> the so-called <mention> sin taxes </mention> 
 <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#23:1:C>
This is true because <,> sloth Mr Speaker <,> is one of the
cardinal sins <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#24:1:C>
Sloth in ordinary parlance is laziness
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#25:1:C>
This Bill represents the lazy government that we have Mr Speaker
because uh these taxes on sin products Mr Speaker are the easiest source of
revenue for government
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#26:1:C>
Every time the government suffers a deficit every time it needs
money <,> it looks at these products petroleum products <,> beer <,> liquor
and cigarettes <,> as the source of revenue since <,,> the taxes are
collected at the place of production <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#27:1:C>
So when government needs immediate cash they resort to these
so-called taxes on sin products <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#28:1:C>
We cannot forever allow this government <,> to keep on imposing
taxes <,> at the same time the government does not do anything about
inefficiency in the collection of taxes in looking for ways and means <,,> of
finding other sources of revenue to defray the cost of government Mr Speaker
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#29:1:C>
So Your Honor we plead you to be agreeable <,,> to put a sunset
clause on this Bill that it only be imposed for two years <,,> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#30:1:D>
Uh Your Honor uh this is not yet the appropriate time to
consider uh the amendments and therefore during the period of amendments the
subject could very well be discussed
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#31:1:D>
But I would want to point out uh Your Honor that uh <,> there had
been occasions also in the past when taxes on these items were reduced by the
government and in fact <,> it was reduced pursuant to uh Executive Order
number nine four seven and further reduced later pursuant to P D nineteen
sixty-nine
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#32:1:D>
So the point Your Honor is while the law that is being amended
seems to be permanent in nature Your Honor because there is no sunset clause
it is however a fact that from time to time the government amends <,> 
whenever there is no further need for this
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#33:1:D>
And in fact the government has indeed amended by reducing the taxes
in the past <,> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#34:1:C>
Uh Mr Speaker uh this uh <,> probably in the history of the
national Internal Revenue Code <,> the taxes on so-called sin products have
been the most dynamic <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#35:1:C>
Year in and year out they have been increased simply because the
government is lazy to improve <,> its <.> rec </.> collection system <,> and
to look for ways <,> of uh looking for alternative sources of revenue and to
cut <,> the burgeoning uh bureaucracy <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#36:1:C>
My point uh Your Honor is <,> let 's deliver a message to the
government <,,> that at least it must put its house in order at least in
terms of raising revenues
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#37:1:C>
They cannot forever come to us in this chamber and impose taxes
which heat which <,> hit both the both the poor and the rich <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#38:1:C>
These are the taxes which cut across all sectors of society because
these are the taxes which are shifted to the consumers <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#39:1:C>
When you buy beer the company does not pay the tax it 's the beer
drinker who pays the tax <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#40:1:C>
When uh <,> you smoke a cigarette it is not the government which
pay the tax because it is not the company which pays the tax it is the small
 <unclear> word </unclear> who pay the tax
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#41:1:C>
And usually it is the poor people <,> who want to drink for example
uh rum or <,> smoke uhm locally manufactured cigarettes cheap local
cigarettes who are hit by this kind of taxes <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#42:1:C>
So let 's teach at least this government a lesson <,> to improve
its taxes collection system
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#43:1:C>
And as the Speaker said <,> let 's cut <,> or trim down the budget
of the government by uh removing uh the excess fat <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#44:1:C>
That 's one way of uh keeping the government <,> within its means
 <,> instead of raising taxes which impose a heavy burden on our people <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#45:1:C>
So Mr Speaker <,> if the uh the uh sponsor of uh or uhm uh our
Honorable Chairman would agree <,> just to deliver a message to the
government why don't we just put a limit a timeframe for these increased
taxes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#46:1:C>
By nineteen ninety-two <,> these increased taxes should be <,> 
should have a sunset clause
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#47:1:C>
After nineteen ninety-two then we go back to the reduced the
existing rates

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#48:1:D>
Uh Mr Speaker the Committee on Ways and Means of which the
gentleman is a member has been doing its best to compel the government to
improve its collection <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#49:1:D>
And the fact remains Mr Speaker that during the deliberation of
this Bill the gentleman never spoke against it <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#50:1:D>
So it came as a surprise for a Vice-Chairman of the Committee on
Ways and Means would now be talking about all those things when he kept quiet
all this time during the deliberation by the Committee
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#51:1:D>
Mr Speaker I want to point out that under the rule <,> a member who
voted in favor of a measure has no business talking about or against that
certain measure

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#52:1:C>
Mr Speaker what I 'm trying to deliver was is to deliver a
message to the government that we cannot keep on uhm imposing taxes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#53:1:C>
What I 'm suggesting is let 's deliver a message by putting a
timeframe to the effectivity of these increased taxes

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#54:1:D>
No <{> <[> Your Honor </[> I will not accept that

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#55:1:C>
<[> This is uh </[> </{> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#56:1:D>
<{> <[> This is not </[> the period of amendment Mr Speaker
 <,> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#57:1:C>
<[> Just giving the </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#58:1:B>
With the permission of the gentlemen on the floor the session
is suspended <,> <&> break in recording </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#59:1:B>
Session is resumed <,,> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#60:1:C>
Mr Speaker <,> uh pursuant to Section twenty-nine of uh the
House Rules I have filed my written objection to this Bill with the Secretary
 <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#61:1:C>
So it cannot be said <,> that uh as a member of this of the
Committee on Ways and Means I did not uh stand up and interpellate
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#62:1:C>
And Mr Speaker it 's not true that I 'm here to grandstand <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#63:1:C>
What I 'm here is to deliver to the government that we cannot go on
relying on taxes <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#64:1:C>
Uh the government should also impose uh <,> put its house in order
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#65:1:C>
That 's all Mr Speaker <,> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#66:1:D>
Uh Mr Speaker <,> as Chairman of the Committee I 'm not aware
of the written objection cited by the gentleman
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#67:1:D>
But the fact remains <,> that he participated actively in drafting
these provisions
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#68:1:D>
And in fact I do remember that he was the one who called me in the
office of Commissioner Ong <,> to do the finishing touches <,> on all of
these provisions <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#69:1:D>
So Your Honor <,,> as Vice Chairman of the Committee <,> he has to
fulfill his duty <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#70:1:D>
And as I 've said <,> I 'm not aware of such written objection <,> 
and this Committee report does not state such reservation <,> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#71:1:A>
Mr Speaker <unclear> words </unclear> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#72:1:B>
Yes yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#73:1:A>
The uh gentleman from the first district of the province of
Cebu the Honorable Antonio Bacaltos be recognized to interpellate the sponsor

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#74:1:D>
May I be allowed <{> <[> to <,> </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#75:1:B>
<[> Any member </{> any member can stand up and seek
recognition of the Chair without having to clear with the Majority Leader
should the any member wish to interpellate
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#76:1:B>
The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Cebu <,> and the sponsor
may yield if he so desires <,> 

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#77:1:E>
Thank you Mr Speaker <,,> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#78:1:A>
The gentleman from Cebu <,> has sought uh permission of the
sponsor to interpellate
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#79:1:A>
And the sponsor may yield if he so desires <,> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#80:1:D>
Yes Your Honor go ahead

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#81:1:E>
Mr Speaker Your Honor <,> may I be allowed to ask whether
there is any difference or distinction between the word <mention> <foreign> 
ad valorem </foreign> </mention> tax and excise tax <,,> <foreign> ad valorem
 </foreign> tax and excise tax
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#82:1:E>
Is there any distinction between <{> <[> the </[> two

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#83:1:D>
<[> Excise tax </[> </{> Your Honor is a term that is used on
specific items uh it is a kind of tax Your Honor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#84:1:D>
The <foreign> ad valorem </foreign> Your Honor is based on value
 <,> 

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#85:1:E>
Value
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#86:1:E>
Now may I please refer Your Honor Mr Speaker to the provision of
 <,,> one one eight four six two letter D found on the fourth page of the Bill
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#87:1:E>
Now what really is the intent of the Committee insofar as the word
 <,> <mention> <foreign> ad valorem </foreign> </mention> tax of of sixty-five
percent open parenthesis sixty-five percent close parenthesis of the <w> 
importers' </w> wholesale price and fifty-five percent <,> open parenthesis
figure fifty-five percent close parenthesis beginning July one nineteen
ninety <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#88:1:E>
Is this not to be understood that there is a reduction of the
 <foreign> ad valorem </foreign> tax <,> July one nineteen ninety
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#89:1:E>
In other words from sixty-five it has to be reduced to fifty-five
percent

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#90:1:D>
That is correct Your Honor and this is pursuant to a
commitment made by the government <,> uh pursuant to the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade uh <,> with a syncronym uh acronym rather <,> GATT
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#91:1:D>
This is one of the GATT provisions

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#92:1:E>
Uh there is uh does it have to be understood therefore that uh
instead of increasing it has to be reduced
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#93:1:E>
Because what I understand in the caption of this Bill is that <,> 
and it reads as follows an act increasing the <foreign> ad valorem </foreign> 
tax on fermented liquors <,,> uh an act increasing the excise tax on
distilled spirits wines fermented liquor and cigarettes amending for the
purpose section one thirty-eight one thirty-nine one hundred forty and one
hundred forty-two open parenthesis C close parenthesis and open parenthesis D
close parenthesis of the national Internal Revenue Code as amended
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#94:1:E>
Am I therefore <,> wrong in my <.> por </.> perception that this
would amount to a reduction instead of an increase so that the government
will profit by way of increasing tax on imported cigarettes

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#95:1:D>
The gentleman is correct Your Honor and perhaps at the
appropriate time the title of the Bill may be amended
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#96:1:D>
But the point here Mr Speaker is that uh the government does not
collect anything on imported cigarettes because nobody pays taxes on imported
cigarettes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#97:1:D>
And the reduction Your Honor is to make the imported cigarettes at
par with locally manufactured cigarettes bearing a foreign brand which will
be also fifty-five percent
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#98:1:D>
And this as I have said Your Honor is one of the commitments made
by the government <,> uh pursuant to the uh General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#99:1:E>
So the subsequent question will be in this manner
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#100:1:E>
Uh <,,> do you think it would be proper to incorporate this
provision relating to letter D of uh section one hundred forty-two
considering that what is within the contemplation as explained by Your Honor
Mr Speaker is that it has to be reduced or was it because is it because of
the reduction contemplated in letter D that there was sort of a conformity on
the part of the distinguished author that at the time of amendment such an
amendment might uh come in for introduction <,> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#101:1:D>
Your Honor perhaps what could be done is to amend the title
of the Bill
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#102:1:D>
Because Your Honor what we are doing really is shooting two birds
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-051#103:1:D>
Our government made a commitment to <,> uh other countries and uh
according to other countries pursuant to the discussion made by our
government our government cannot use should not use <,> internal taxes <,> to
protect domestically <.> proda </.> uh produced products which are of the
same kind as the one being exported to us </I>
