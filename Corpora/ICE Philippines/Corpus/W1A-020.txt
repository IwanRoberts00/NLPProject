Problem: Based on your reading on language acquisition, describe
your own theory of word learning.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#X6:1>
Your theory should specify ( a) the general processes by which
children come to acquire understanding of the meaning of words, and ( b) the
factors that affect these general processes.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#X7:1>
You should feel free to appropriate the general assumptions and
principles of different theories of word learning; just make sure you make
the corresponding citations.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#X8:1>
Finally, you should cite the pertinent empirical evidence to support
your theory. </p> </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#9:1>
As a mother and a teacher, I have my own observations of how
language is learned or acquired but I recognize the fact that to answer this
question scholarly I cannot invoke my own idea.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#10:1>
Therefore I will refer to the works of the different scholars in the
field of psycholinguistics and linguistics who have posited theories in
relation to the acquisition of language, in particular how children acquire a
language. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#11:1>
The traditional theory was that cited by B. F. Skinner and other
behaviorists which posits that language is learned by imitation or by habit.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#12:1>
This view came under heavy fire and is no longer accepted nowadays.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#13:1>
One of the reasons offered against this traditional view is that it
cannot fully account for the errors children manifest in their early language
learning.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#14:1>
For example, a three-year old will say: <quote> &ldquo; Dad throwed
the ball &rdquo; </quote> or <quote> &ldquo; He goed to the market &rdquo;
</quote> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#15:1>
If children indeed learn from adults via imitation, what could
account for these errors since these ungrammatical sentences are not produced
or heard in the adults?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#16:1>
Of course I am talking about normal correct adult speech.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#17:1>
So this theory is rejected, especially in the Chomskyan world.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#18:1>
If Chomsky ( 1964), criticized this view, then what reason does he
have to offer, and what alternative theory does he have to explain how
children acquire language?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#19:1>
His answer is that children possess an innate capacity to learn a
language ( what he calls UG) and he adds that all children undergo the same
process.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#20:1>
Evidence to this may be seen in the stages of language development
which begin from vegetative sounds, cooing, vocal play, babbling, one-word
stage, two-word stage, telegraphic speech, sorting stage, and finally
complete, normal speech ( the period covers from birth till five years old;
source: Dictionary of Linguistic Terms under the field of Psycholinguistics,
2001, General Reference Section.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#21:1>
This is also discussed in Paul Bloom 's article, 1994).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#22:1>
This means that children have the cognitive capacity to learn a
language and therefore, even without training, they will pick up a language
given the right environment for language learning. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#23:1>
The next question now that begs to be answered following the
Chomsky 's line of argument is how can he account for the errors that
children commit in their early stage of language learning?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#24:1>
Chomsky 's answer to this is that the errors are part of the
performance errors.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#25:1>
He distinguishes two concepts relative to language acquisition, and
performance is one of these.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#26:1>
Performance pertains to how language is used by someone in response
to what another interlocutor has said.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#27:1>
Some examples of performance errors are slips, hesitation, and
stuttering.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#28:1>
Competence, on the other hand, is defined by Chomsky as the learner 's
tacit knowledge of grammar rules ( definitions of <mention> competence
</mention> and <mention> performance </mention> are also discussed in the
preliminary pages of Andrew Radford 's book <it> Syntactic Theory </it> ,
1997). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#29:1>
Others say that children learn by observing the social contexts
that govern communication or when communication occurs.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#30:1>
Upon examining the contexts, children learn meanings of words and are
eventually able to use these words in the appropriate contexts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#31:1>
But what have I learned in my readings in Psycholinguistics that
emphasized child language acquisition ( since psycholinguistics is a broad
field and cannot afford to discuss all matters pertaining to the mind in
relation to language)?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#32:1>
The course gave me so much to think about with regard to theories in
word learning and some of these are the constraints and syntactic cues to
word learning.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#33:1>
I begin my discussion on these below. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#34:1>
As early as the first article of Paul Bloom ( 1994) entitled
<mention> &ldquo; OVERVIEW: CONTROVERSIES IN LANGUAGE ACQUISITION, &rdquo;
</mention> we can already see what these constraints and syntactic cues are.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#35:1>
The first is the whole-object constraint proposed by Ellen Markman (
1990).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#36:1>
Other proponents are Markman and Hutchinson ( 1984), Markman and
Wachtel ( 1988).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#37:1>
( There are others but I am afraid to mention their corresponding
years lest I make a mistake.)

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#38:1>
The principal advocate of this constraint is Markman, who posits that
children assume that words or labels refer to whole objects rather than to
other parts or properties ( shape, color, size) or substances.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#39:1>
The other constraint is the taxonomic constraint, which posits that
children choose objects of the same kinds as referents to novel labels rather
choosing thematically related objects ( <foreign> e.g. </foreign> dog and a
bone).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#40:1>
Markman conducted experiments using infants from 18 months to 2 years
testing these two constraints and results proved her hypotheses.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#41:1>
However, there 's a qualification as to when children as early as 18
months use the taxonomic constraint.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#42:1>
According to Markman, children use the taxonomic constraint when a
label or a novel word is provided, but when this is absent, children opt for
objects that are taxonomically related to the target object presented.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#43:1>
For example, if I present a picture of dog and labeled it as
<mention> <it> dax </it> </mention> , and then in the second condition I
again presented a picture of a dog and its bone, and then I say to an
18-month-old child, <quote> &ldquo; Find me another one. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#44:1>
If the taxonomic constraint works as Markman and others claim, then
the child will choose the dog as the referent of the novel label <mention>
<it> dax </it> </mention> rather than the bone.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#45:1>
However, if the target object is not given a label, following the
same example, just <mention> dog </mention> in the first condition and then
in the next condition two pictures are presented, that of a dog and a bone,
then the child will choose <mention> bone </mention> when cued to find
another one.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#46:1>
The third constraint to word learning which Markman proposes is the
mutual exclusivity constraint which means that children assume that there is
only one label to an object.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#47:1>
The theory may be stated otherwise: Children assume that there is
only one lexical entry occupying a semantic niche.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#48:1>
This constraint is helpful because it overrides the bias that
children have to objects.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#49:1>
An example of how mutual exclusivity constraint works is this.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#50:1>
A child is familiar to the concept and word <mention> cup </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#51:1>
When an experimenter holds a cup and an unfamiliar object, say a
magic clipper which he calls <mention> <it> krucker </it> </mention> ( that
is transparent and contains two binders inside), the child will assume that
<mention> <it> krucker </it> </mention> cannot refer to cup and therefore
chooses the magic clipper as the referent of the word <mention> <it> krucker
</it> </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#52:1>
Now I said that the mutual exclusivity constraint is helpful in
overriding the bias that children have towards objects.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#53:1>
How does this work?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#54:1>
Well it works this way.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#55:1>
When a child is given a novel label <mention> chrome </mention> and
an object say a cup again to which he/she is familiar and presented another
object that is exactly the same except for the material that it is made of
and is instructed to point to the <mention> chrome </mention> , the child
will assume that <mention> chrome </mention> refers to something else, either
to the substance or to another property of the cup. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#56:1>
There are criticisms offered to the constraints proposed by
Markman.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#57:1>
One criticism stems from Nelson ( 1988) who argues that they are
fundamentally flawed.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#58:1>
Gathercole also criticizes the constraints to word learning saying
that they are not really constraints in the real sense but rather a bias.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#59:1>
He calls attention to the experiment conducted by Markman that lends
support to how children use the mutual exclusivity constraint.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#60:1>
He says that this cannot represent the general children since the
results only showed a statistical trend in using the bias.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#61:1>
Paul Bloom and Deborah Keleman ( 1995) in their paper on syntactic
cues to learning nouns also advance their criticisms against the whole-object
constraint saying that the child is not confronted with just whole objects
all the time. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#62:1>
Paul Bloom, however, noted that the criticisms hurled against the
constraints to word learning do not speak of a critical flaw but simply a
gap, and therefore further studies need to be conducted to find their
generalizability of application. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#63:1>
After Ellen Markman comes Eve Clark who also proposes a
constraint similar to mutual exclusivity which she calls the <mention>
principle of contrast </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#64:1>
The mutual exclusivity by the way goes with other names like the
<mention> one-to-one mapping </mention> of Slobin, if my memory serves me
right, the <mention> Uniqueness principle </mention> of Pinker ( 1987) and
the <mention> principle of preemption </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#65:1>
Of all these other names, the principle of contrast is the one that
comes closest to the mutual exclusivity constraint.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#66:1>
According to Clark, there is no such thing as synonymous words for
every word is different in meaning.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#67:1>
If there is such a difference then it is very slight or subtle so
that if children know that a word is different in meaning, when presented
with a novel term like <mention> <it> bicker </it> </mention> as referring to
the novel object ( toothpaste squeezer) to which they are not yet familiar,
concomitant with a term that they are already familiar, say a feeding bottle,
then they will assume that <mention> <it> bicker </it> </mention> pertains to
the toothpaste squeezer, and not to the feeding bottle. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#68:1>
Clark also talks about the principle of conventionality and other
principles like transparency, simplicity, and production.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#69:1>
The principle of conventionality states that words in a language have
established meanings as agreed upon by the members of the community where
that language is used so that if words already have established meanings,
then when novel terms are used, they cannot be the same as those words
already existent in the lexicon of the said language.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#70:1>
Therefore, children, or even adults, since this specific principle
also works for adults, are constrained to look for something else as the
meaning of the novel terms.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#71:1>
What about the principle of transparency and simplicity?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#72:1>
Well I take the two together since they are similar.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#73:1>
These two principles assume that if language is given or used in a
transparent and simple manner to the children, they will inevitably be aided
to learn the language.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#74:1>
Production, on the other hand, maintains that if children are to
learn, they must hear this language in a suitable learning environment so
that they themselves can in process acquire the language. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#75:1>
Aside from the constraints to word learning, there are also
syntactic cues that are thought to be in operation in the children.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#76:1>
Proponents of syntactic cues to word learning are Landau and
Gleitman, Lila, Hirsh-Pasek; Golinkoff ( 1988); Brown ( 1957); Naigles,
Leticia R. ( 1990; 1996) ( who was Gleitman 's student and advisee); Bloom,
Paul and Keleman, Deborah ( 1995), and many others. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#77:1>
As early as 1957 as cited above, Brown already found out that
children are able to use syntactic cues to learn words.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#78:1>
He conducted an experiment with kids whereby he presented the word
<mention> <it> sib </it> </mention> in different structures.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#79:1>
The experiment went like this: To a group of about two-year kids, he
asked: <quote> Do you know what it means to <it> sib </it> ? </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#80:1>
Then he presented a picture and said: <quote> &ldquo; This is
sibbing." </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#81:1>
In the second sentence structure, he presented the word <mention>
<it> sib </it> </mention> as a count noun.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#82:1>
He said <quote> &ldquo; This is a <it> sib </it> ." </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#83:1>
In the third sentence structure, he presented the word <mention> <it>
sib </it> </mention> as a mass noun and said <quote> &ldquo; This is sib.
&rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#84:1>
After such presentations, he asked those children questions that
called for the answer in each sentence structure like <quote> Show me <it>
sibbing </it> , a <it> sib </it> , and <it> sib </it> </quote> ( based on a
group of pictures).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#85:1>
The results showed that children as young as two were already
sensitive to the syntax of these words. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#86:1>
Now what about Lila Gleitman, what does she have to show
regarding word learning in relation to syntactic cues?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#87:1>
In her 1992 paper ( albeit she also worked previously on the same
topic with Landau, for example, with another Gleitman, H. ( maybe her husband
and others) entitled <mention> structural sources of verb meanings </mention>
, she explains through an experiment that children from 16 to 19 months are
able to use syntactic cues as aids to learning or acquiring verbs.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#88:1>
But before this she begins her paper by quoting Locke ( 1690/1964
book no: I forgot) who says that people learn by observing or looking at
their environment.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#89:1>
While acknowledging that this is true, in fact, this idea is still
followed up to now, Gleitman says that it cannot fully account for the
process of early language acquisition.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#90:1>
To explicate her point, she cites the case of the blind and the
sighted children who undergo the same process in language learning early in
their lives.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#91:1>
She asks the question of how do we explain the case of the blind
child who learns the same words like the sighted children?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#92:1>
Clearly, observing the environment or learning by perception is not
enough and does not guarantee language learning.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#93:1>
She therefore combines observation and the use of syntactic
bootstrapping as a means by which children learn words.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#94:1>
Syntactic bootstrapping is a procedure whereby children focus on the
structure or the position of where the word, for example a verb, occurs.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#95:1>
She also discusses semantic bootstrapping.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#96:1>
This comes to play when children perceive the meaning of words via
perception.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#97:1>
So when the children already know the meaning of words, they still
use the syntactic cue to aid them in finding the meaning of the target verb
they are given.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-020#98:1>
Thus Gleitman says semantic bootstrapping comes at the end of
syntactic bootstrapping, hence she titles her paper <mention> structural
sources of verb meanings </mention> , for clearly, the sources are more than
one. </p> </I>
