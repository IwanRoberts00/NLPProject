Mrs Witness who was Atty Fernando Chua as introduced to you by
Mr Go

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#2:1:B>
Atty Fernando Chua according to Mr Go represents a certain uh
principal or client of the bank who wants to lend to a corporation using his
personal funds

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#3:1:C>
Mr Chief Justice

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#4:1:D>
Yes

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#5:1:C>
We will have to move to strike out the answer of the witness

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#6:1:D>
On what ground

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#7:1:C>
On the ground in the first place that it is hearsay and that
the answers <?> sure </?> to be elicited are not covered by any of the
paragraphs of the second article of impeachment
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#8:1:C>
If Your Honor please uh the private prosecutor adverted to the fact
that uh he wants to prove that the President accumulated unexplained wealth
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#9:1:C>
That is what I gathered from uh his statement just a while ago
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#10:1:C>
But the allegation is this Your Honor <quote> the President by that
sworn statement also committed perjury and the offense of unexplained wealth
because </quote> this is the this is the point Your Honor <quote> because
records show that he and his wife and mistresses and their children have
other assets in other companies outside of the three firms listed in his
statement of assets and liabilities </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#11:1:C>
Those are the only assets

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#12:1:D>
That that had been read into the records already

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#13:1:C>
Yes Your Honor that is why the tendency of the question now is
to elicit the answers that will not be evidentiary of what has been alleged
in the articles of impeachment
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#14:1:C>
So

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#15:1:D>
It there could be some kind of evidentiary value but the it is
the manner of presenting it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#16:1:A>
Yes Your Honor

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#17:1:D>
The counsel should uh do it in such a way that he 'll be able
to link it if he wants to
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#18:1:D>
Unless you 'll be able to establish that linkage the Chair will
have to sustain the objection

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#19:1:A>
Your Honor please if we will be allowed to proceed we will
establish the linkage

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#20:1:D>
You may nobody 's preventing you from uh proceeding but uh do
it in such a way that you would be avoid you you 'll be able to avoid
objections

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#21:1:A>
Your Honor the objection was hearsay I think it is baseless

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#22:1:D>
Well uh you want the the Chair now to make a ruling on that

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#23:1:A>
The fact that the witness heard

 <$D> It is uh the the the Chair will have to sustain it is hearsay but you
can do something about it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#24:1:A>
Your Your Honor it is independently relevant because the
witness is merely <.> test </.> testifying to what was told to her

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#25:1:D>
If it is only offered therefore as an uh independently
relevant statement the answer may remain but that should not be taken as
evidence <,> <{> <[> on proof </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#26:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{> we agree Your Honor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#27:1:A>
Thank you <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#28:1:A>
And Mrs Ocampo did Mr Go identify the borrower of the amount of
five hundred million pesos

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#29:1:C>
We 'll have to maintain the same objection for being
immaterial and irrelevant Your Honor

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#30:1:D>
Objection overruled

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#31:1:A>
Thank you Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#32:1:B>
Uhm Mr Go mentioned that the borrower is Wellex Group
Incorporated
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#33:1:B>
Mr Chua then followed through by saying that it is Wellex Group
because the principal is very close to Mr Gatchalian and uhm wants to uh help
him

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#34:1:C>
We 'll have to move to strike out Mr Chief Justice the answer
of the witness

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#35:1:D>
What is the basis

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#36:1:C>
On the ground that it uh it calls for hearsay evidence Your
Honor

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#37:1:D>
As it is on it calls for hearsay evidence not that it was
hearsay

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#38:1:C>
It is hearsay Your Honor actually

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#39:1:D>
Overruled

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#40:1:C>
Thank you Your Honor

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#41:1:D>
Part of the narration of the witness

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#42:1:A>
Thank You Your Honor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#43:1:A>
And did Mr did Atty Fernando Chua Mrs Ocampo advise you on when
this loan transaction was supposed to be completed

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#44:1:B>
Uhm that uh we met on February third two thousand he mentioned
that the loan five hundred million should be released on or before twelve
noon the next day February fourth two thousand

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#45:1:A>
What instructions if any did Mr Go give you with respect to
the proposed loan transaction of the principal of Atty Chua

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#46:1:C>
Mr Chief Justice we have to object again on the ground that uh
it does not have a tendency to connect the testimony of the witness to any of
the paragraphs of article two

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#47:1:D>
Was the <.> object </.> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#48:1:C>
The articles of impeachment

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#49:1:D>
<.> Wha </.> what 's the comment of the presenting counsel

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#50:1:A>
It 's independent it 's independently relevant Your Honor
based on the same ruling of the Chair

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#51:1:D>
<.> Ho </.> how <.> ju </.> just to avoid further objection
later on <.> ho </.> would you try to give us an idea how it is how it would
become relevant or material

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#52:1:A>
Because the documents that will

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#53:1:D>
Uh for this purpose uh can we require the parties to approach
the bench <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#54:1:D>
Atty Mendoza and <,> who else for the defense <&> pause of several
minutes </&> <&> gavel </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#55:1:D>
The session is now resumed <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#56:1:D>
Is there a pending question Atty Bautista <,> or a pending
objection

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#57:1:A>
May we proceed Your Honor <,> on another point

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#58:1:D>
You may proceed
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#59:1:D>
Go direct to the point

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#60:1:A>
Yes Your Honor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#61:1:A>
Mrs Ocampo as trust officer of the P C I of the Equitable P C I
Bank are you aware of an account a trust account in the name of Jose Velarde

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#62:1:B>
Yes

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#63:1:C>
Mr Chief Justice we have to object to the question for lack of
basis and for being immaterial and irrelevant
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#64:1:C>
It is not alleged uh it has no tendency to prove any of the
allegations in article two of the articles of impeachment

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#65:1:D>
Yesterday the Court uh opened uh the sealed envelope uh
containing that particular account
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#66:1:D>
So as to the first basis uh overruled
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#67:1:D>
As to the second basis may be preliminary

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#68:1:C>
Thank you Mr Chief Justice

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#69:1:A>
Thank you Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#70:1:B>
Yes I 'm aware of an account in the name of Jose Velarde

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#71:1:A>
Can you explain to us in brief the circumstances on how you
came to know about the account of Jose Velarde

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#72:1:C>
Mr Chief Justice I 'm sorry I have to object again <.> unle
 </.> unless they present the proper basis

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#73:1:D>
Lay the basis

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#74:1:C>
Because there is no connection between Jose Velarde and the
respondent in this case
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#75:1:C>
They have not established the connection Mr President

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#76:1:D>
During the uh when uh the parties were called to approach the
bench uh among the agreement was for you to lay the basis and to go direct to
the point

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#77:1:A>
This trust account Mrs Ocampo is this covered by any documents

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#78:1:C>
Leading Your Honor

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#79:1:A>
Preliminary Your Honor

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#80:1:C>
We we have made an objection <{> <[> <,> </[> on the ground
that there is no connection between Jose Velarde and the respondent and Jose
Velarde has never been mentioned

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#81:1:D>
<[> But the </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#82:1:D>
Then the the <.> wit </.> the witness may answer in this uh on this
issue and the on on this particular issue you may proceed
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#83:1:D>
And as I said the Chair would repeat go direct to the point

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#84:1:A>
Yes Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#85:1:B>

You compare that with the uh

<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#136:1:C>
Mr Mr Chief Justice Sir may I call the attention of the Court
that uh the markings were apparently done by the private prosecutors
themselves
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#137:1:C>
We do not see any initial of the clerk of court who is the
secretary of the impeachment court

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#138:1:D>
Is that true
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#139:1:D>
Private prosecutor <{> <[> you did </[> the marking yourselves

<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#140:1:C>

<[> The copies </[> </{> that were given to us Your Honor do
not bear any initial of uh either Atty Yap or Atty Barbo

<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#156:1:D>
One set of the uh documents

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#157:1:E>
Because I could not uh affix my signature in all of the Xerox
copies Your Honor

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#158:1:D>
The defense would have would be entitled to uh receive the
copies of the documents uh as uh marked by uh the officer of the court to
avoid any possibility of uh uh <,,> tampering or whatever
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#159:1:D>
And at least in the course of the cross-examination the proper

and to see the copies also furnished the presiding justice if these copies uh
had been initialed by him <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#180:1:D>
Uh would you please make of record your answer to the query of uh
the uh presiding justice

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#181:1:E>
Uh Your Honor the copies which I have uh verified are not the
copies which uh I initialed

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#182:1:D>
See even even the documents uh given to the presiding justice
are not the ones marked

 <$G> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#183:1:G>
Uh Your Honors I confirm what the clerk of court said that he
marked and initialed only one set <,,> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#184:1:D>
That is why <{> <[> why </[> were we given uh copies of
documents which were not initialed

 <$G> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#185:1:G>
<[> Following </[> </{> following because uh precisely

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#186:1:D>
Unless these are not initialed they do not appear to be uh
official documents of uh the uh the the Court

 <$G> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#187:1:G>
Yes Your Honor following the instructions of the Court we had
that very set initialed and marked by the clerk of court photocopied again

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#188:1:D>
Photocopy again the initialed document

 <$G> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#189:1:G>
Yes uh Your Honors

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#190:1:D>
<unclear> 1 word </unclear> of the defense uh of the
prosecution that it will be submitted as uh uh it would be subjected to the
condition that if once there is a a connection or once it would establish an
allegation then it would stand
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#191:1:D>
If it will not then it has to be expunged from the record and that
should be very made uh it should be clear to all parties concerned
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#192:1:D>
If you if the prosecution cannot make any connection direct or
indirect the testimony would be stricken off the record and expunged
therefrom

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#193:1:A>
Yes Your Honor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#194:1:A>
But that connection may not necessarily be established through
this witness
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#195:1:A>
That connection could be done through other witnesses through
other evidence
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-070#196:1:A>
We would like to present the statement of assets of liabilities of
the President which is a public record which says that he only has
thirty-five million pesos Your Honor

President owns the Jose Velarde account which on this one sole transaction
alone involved five hundred million pesos
