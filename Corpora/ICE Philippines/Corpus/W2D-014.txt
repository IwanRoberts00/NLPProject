<h> <bold> Health nut </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#6:1>
DO you know Dawn Schafer?

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#7:1>
If you were at one time a member of the Babysitters Club like I was,
you would know who I am talking about. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#8:1>
Dawn, my personal favorite among babysitters, was a health nut and
a true individual.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#9:1>
I admire her discipline and self-confidence, attributes not usually
found in pubescent girls undergoing an identity crisis and hormonal changes.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#10:1>
Growing up, I tried to follow Dawn 's example.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#11:1>
At this point, I believe I can shove modesty aside and say I have
been quite successful in achieving my individuality.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#12:1>
( It also helps I went to the University of the Philippines where
eccentricity is championed.) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#13:1>
As to being a health nut, however, I can only say I am a work in
progress.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#14:1>
I was brought up a meat-eater.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#15:1>
Like most children, I detested healthy, nutritious stuff and
preferred candy and junk food.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#16:1>
Less nutritious foods just seemed to taste better.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#17:1>
Characters like Dawn, fictional or otherwise, <foreign> piqued
</foreign> my interest in their uncommon diets. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#18:1>
I have always liked to think of myself as a conscientious and
caring person.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#19:1>
And I 'm proud to say that the desire for self-improvement is a
constant in my life.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#20:1>
But although I would like to be in the pink of health, both in body
and soul, that is not the main reason I chose to follow Dawn 's example and
become a vegetarian.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#21:1>
I am a sworn animal lover ( not counting roaches, I suppose) and
intend to be an animal rights advocate as well. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#22:1>
<mention> Intention </mention> is the key word.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#23:1>
As I have already mentioned, I haven't been completely transformed
yet.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#24:1>
The best I can do now is to proclaim I do not eat red meat anymore.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#25:1>
I am what you might call a <mention> semi-vegetarian </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#26:1>
I still eat chicken, fish and other seafoods, although only
occasionally.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#27:1>
My goal is to become a <foreign> lacto </foreign> - vegetarian, one
who also eats dairy products. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#28:1>
Vegetarianism is not as simple as avoiding meat.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#29:1>
There are several ways to go about it.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#30:1>
A vegan or a pure vegetarian is not supposed to take any product that
comes from animals, including milk and eggs.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#31:1>
Other kinds of vegetarian are: <foreign> Lacto </foreign> -
vegetarian--my goal as I have mentioned; <foreign> ovo </foreign> -
vegetarian--eats eggs; <foreign> lacto-ovo </foreign> - vegetarian--eats eggs
and milk products; <foreign> pescetarian </foreign> - - eats fish;
fruitarian--only eats fruits and vegetables that do not destroy the plants
where they came from. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#32:1>
We will not even discuss vegetarians who only consume organically
grown things and follow a macrobiotic diet ( stuff that is supposed to keep
your body in harmony with nature). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#33:1>
Before I actually reached this stage of semi-vegetarianism, I
went through several vain attempts in the past.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#34:1>
I have my sister to thank for joining me in my crusade to shun the
carcasses of slaughtered animals. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#35:1>
<h> <bold> Eating habits </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#36:1>
You should have a certain resolve if you want to become a vegan.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#37:1>
In most cases, it is not merely a diet, but a way of life.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#38:1>
You have to plan how you are going to approach the whole transition.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#39:1>
Here are tips on how you can change your eating habits: </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#40:1>
1. Announce--

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#41:1>
Let it be known to family and friends that you have decided to stop
eating God 's creatures.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#42:1>
It makes quitting later more embarrassing.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#43:1>
You might also surround yourself with sensitive and considerate
people who would not drag you to burger joints or offer you hotdogs and
bacon, thus helping you avoid temptation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#44:1>
2. Be knowledgeable--

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#45:1>
Read about vegetarianism.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#46:1>
You will be able to pick up information, which can help you survive
the first stage of your transition.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#47:1>
It will be a good idea to research on vegan restaurants and
alternative cuisine with meat substitutes like gluten and <foreign> tofu
</foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#48:1>
3. Set aside money for meals--

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#49:1>
This should not be a problem if you are already working.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#50:1>
But if you are still dependent on meals prepared by your mother, you
might find your hands tied behind your back.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#51:1>
You should not expect the people around you to change just to make
things easier for you.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#52:1>
It is wise to get suitable supplies for those occasions when your mom
doesn't cook. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#53:1>
4. Be involved in preparing meals--

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#54:1>
Number three should not be a problem if you have a say in the menu.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#55:1>
It will also help you become familiar with vegetarian recipes.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#56:1>
Believe me, vegetarianism is not so difficult if you know how to go
about it.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#57:1>
Not everything is bland or tastes like sawdust.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#58:1>
There are many tasty vegetarian dishes out there. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#59:1>
5. Love animals--

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#60:1>
Every time you are about to bite into a juicy piece of meat, bear in
mind that it used to be alive.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#61:1>
Imagine if your own beloved pet suffers the same fate. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#62:1>
Not all people are carnivores.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#63:1>
One of the things I remember from Sunday school was the explanation
why many, before the deluge, lived to be 900 or older.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#64:1>
The reason was simply that they did not eat meat. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#65:1>
People only started eating meat after the floods ruined the land.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#66:1>
Even if you do not want to reach 100 or do not believe this story, it
is still a wise idea to be healthy.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#67:1>
And it is nice to treat other living creatures with respect. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#68:1>
One last unsolicited piece of advice: If you decide to stop
eating meat, don't force your views on others.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#69:1>
You may feel more enlightened than them, but it does not give you the
right to criticize other people 's eating habits.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#70:1>
Just quietly set an example and pray it will inspire them to do the
same. </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#147:3>
Posted: 4:14 PM ( Manila Time) | July 19, 2001

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#148:3>
By Adrian V. Lizares

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#149:3>
Inquirer News Service

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#150:3>
CONSIDER a garden with its cultivator having no sense of
gardening whatsoever.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#151:3>
In the course of my gardening life, I have come across people who
raise questions like: <quote> &ldquo; What can I do to have that little bit
of green despite my lack of knowledge of plants? &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#152:3>
Or worse, <quote> &ldquo; I can't grow anything.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#153:3>
I have a black thumb.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#154:3>
Plants die at the sight of me. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#155:3>
Nonsense!

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#156:3>
There is no such thing as a non-gardener.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#157:3>
In each one of us is a gardener at heart. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#158:3>
If one were not so knowledgeable of gardens, one should start
off with the simplest of plants.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#159:3>
Having a very simple garden also means simple maintenance.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#160:3>
No frills in the garden could easily translate into: No hard work
for the garden.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#161:3>
But then <mention> &ldquo; simple &rdquo; </mention> is a relative
term. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#162:3>
Take the case of Georgie Diaz-Balliet, who swears she has no
gardening capabilities whatsoever.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#163:3>
She has managed to turn a fairly large piece of land into what I
consider a successful garden.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#164:3>
It has all the elements of an interesting garden: History,
functionality, and practicality.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#165:3>
Since she comes from a large family, the garden is a necessary space
for convivial familial get-togethers. </p> <O> Two paragraphs </O>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#166:3>
The garden is down to its barest essentials, juxtaposed to the
stylish settings of Georgie 's home.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#167:3>
It really becomes a blank slate where she invites anyone who is kind
enough to share with her ideas and tips on what to do with her open space.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#168:3>
It 's an interactive garden, so to speak.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#169:3>
You visit, you give ideas, and you implement them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#170:3>
Others have gone before you, however.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#171:3>
Georgie 's husband William planted <indig> narra </indig> trees in
reaction to the depletion of natural Philippine forests.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#172:3>
This later gave way to other plants that Jean, his British mother,
introduced.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#173:3>
These were high-altitude plants like <foreign> auracarias </foreign>
and pine trees and a host of flowering plants.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#174:3>
Georgie later introduced tropicals like <foreign> heliconias
</foreign> and hibiscuses.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#175:3>
She prefers big-leafed varieties like philodendrons.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#176:3>
The fishtail palm provides her with instant bouquets of exotic
seeds. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#177:3>
Friends like Nisy Yabut-Conjuanco and Gabby Barredo brought in
their own ideas, too.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#178:3>
They worked together to create a dry bridge accented with
Balinese-inspired totem lamps made of bamboo and capped with wild grasses.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#179:3>
I, too, was tempted to share some ideas with her, but lunch came all
too soon and with it, the frenzy of a working afternoon shooting other
gardens before heading back to Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#180:3>
It was during this lunch where I noticed the exact purpose of the
garden. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#181:3>
Amid the buildings and the outhouses lay a large brick oven.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#182:3>
Constructed by a specialist that does this type of ovens
specifically for <foreign> pan de sal </foreign> , this huge oven is the
hearth of most of the gatherings that take place in the open spaces.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#183:3>
From this oven roast, meats and vegetables, breads and especially
delicious pizzas emerge. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#184:3>
Another interesting fact from our &ldquo; non-gardener &rdquo;
is that Georgie has now taken to the art of making compost, something she has
learned from Gretchen O. Cojuangco, who is her sister 's mother-in-law.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#185:3>
It is a practical and completely pro-ecological exercise, which she
encourages everyone to do.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#186:3>
So much from one who simply won't admit she is, deep at heart, a
gardener in her own right. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#187:3>
<h> The recipes: </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-014#188:3>
