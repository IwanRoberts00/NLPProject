<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#3:1>
THE Department of Environment and Natural Resources ( DENR)
yesterday declared Caraga a calamity area, suspending all the permits and
licenses for forestry and mining activities in the region. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#4:1>
This developed as an aerial survey of the area showed thousands of
logs swept down into the Agusan river, bolstering an earlier assessment by
officials that the killer floods were a result of a decade of unabated
logging activities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#5:1>
Continuous heavy rains in Caraga the past two weeks caused flash
floods and landslides that have so far killed 23 persons, injured 16 others,
and forced the evacuation of 10,502 families. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#6:1>
The National Disaster Coordinating Council ( NDCC) on Monday
estimated the damages to crops and infrastructure at &peso;229.3 million.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#7:1>
Caraga--which consists of Agusan del Sur, Agusan del Norte, Surigao
del Sur, and Surigao del Norte--is a rice- and corn-growing region. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#8:1>
<h> <bold> Late solutions </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#9:1>
In Butuan, the region 's largest city, crop and infrastructure
damages amounted to about &peso;128 million, according to Mayor Democrito
Plaza II. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#10:1>
President Estrada on Monday declared a state of calamity in the
four Caraga provinces. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#11:1>
As in the past, local officials are cramming for a solution after
the disaster has struck.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#12:1>
Agusan del Norte Rep. Leovigildo Banag said the government was now
mapping out a master plan to restore the forest cover in Caraga. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#13:1>
Environment Secretary Antonio Cerilles said the forestry and
mining permits and licenses were ordered suspended until the damages and
hazards caused by the floods shall have been assessed. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#14:1>
<h> <bold> Seven days </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#15:1>
Cerilles dispatched the agency 's <foreign> La Ni&ntilde;a
</foreign> Damage Assessment Team to fast track disaster mitigation and
rehabilitation measures in flooded areas. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#16:1>
The team--composed of Rolando Pe&ntilde;a from the Office of the
Secretary and Sevillo David Jr. and Romeo Almeda from the Mines and
Geo-Sciences Bureau--was given seven days to complete its damage assessment
report on the Agusan River basin. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#17:1>
The report would be used to determine if the next cycle of rains
could trigger another massive flooding, Cerilles said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#18:1>
In recent weeks, some local officials said, landslides have
accompanied the heavy rains.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#19:1>
Several bridges had also been submerged and some small towns remained
cut off from the city. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#20:1>
Chair Mar Candino of <indig> Barangay </indig> Bancasi outside
Butuan City recalled that in the early 1980s, the region still had lush
forest cover; now, the hillsides are barren. </p>

Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who also chairs the NDCC, was
in Caraga yesterday to assess the destruction and to bring food supplies and
a medical team. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#36:1>
Agriculture Secretary William Dar told local officials in a
briefing that 2,000 sacks of <indig> palay </indig> seeds worth &peso;1.2

<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#37:1>
He also committed 52 sacks of vegetable seeds worth &peso;2 million,
animal dispersals worth &peso;5 million, and farming equipment worth
&peso;8.8 million. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#38:1>
The Philippine National Police chief, Deputy Director General
Lastimoso, ordered the regional police in Caraga to assist not just in
evacuating families affected by the floods but in the distribution of food
and medical supplies as well. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#39:1>
Lastimoso was a battalion commander of the defunct Philippine
Constabulary in Agusan and a PC provincial commander in Surigao del Sur in

<h> <bold> Limits eyed on foreign retailers </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#41:2>
<bold> Marvin Sy </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#42:2>
OFFICIALS from the National Economic and Development Authority (
Neda) yesterday said they have already drafted a set of guidelines on how
foreign companies may engage in retail trade in the country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#43:2>
This developed as a senior legislator yesterday said the House of
Representatives would ask the Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality
of the proposed retail trade liberalization law. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#44:2>
The set of proposed guidelines would be forwarded to both
chambers of Congress for deliberation, said Neda officer-in-charge Raphael
Lotilla. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#45:2>
In an interview yesterday, Lotilla said the proposals cover the
scope of activities that the foreign entrants may engage in. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#46:2>
These include the establishment of department store chains
similar to those of Shoemart and Rustan 's or specialty stores that offer
very specific types of merchandise. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#47:2>
Geographical limitations were also proposed by the NEDA with a
slant toward highly urbanized areas.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#48:2>
Lotilla explained that the geo-physical limits are meant to protect
small retailers in the provinces that have a relatively small market. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#49:2>
<h> <bold> Limitations </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#50:2>
Aside from the geographical limitations, the number and size of
the establishments to be constructed would also be limited. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#51:2>
All the limitations mentioned are aimed at calming the <quote>
&ldquo; basically unfounded" </quote> fears of &ldquo; <indig> sari-sari
</indig> store &rdquo; operators. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#52:2>
But the more cautious members of the House committee in trade and
industry want to consult the Supreme Court first to avoid making the same
mistakes when the oil deregulation bill was made into law. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#53:2>
This was expressed by Quezon Rep. Marcial Punzalan ( Lamp) who
chairs the House committee on trade and industry.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#54:2>
He said his panel would meet again to discuss technical and legal
aspects of the proposed bill. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#55:2>
<h> <bold> Local concerns </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#56:2>
But another lawmaker, Negros Oriental Rep. Herminio Teves,
claimed the high court would not entertain the committee 's inquiry because
the tribunal only decides on existing laws and cases. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#57:2>
<quote> &ldquo; When the bill is passed, then they can bring it
to the courts, &rdquo; </quote> Teves said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#58:2>
Both lawmakers also allayed fears that the liberalization of
retail trade would result in foreign domination of that sector. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#59:2>
Concern had been raised by retail groups on the impact of
liberalization on the small and medium-sized retailers.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#60:2>
They claimed that the entry of foreign companies would &ldquo; kill
&rdquo; local retailers because of the lower prices that foreigner is
expected to offer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#61:2>
Lotilla, however, explained that the entry of the foreign
retailers would have no negative effect on the &ldquo; <indig> sari-sari
</indig> store &rdquo; owners because foreign retailers would not be engaging
in activities of that scale. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#62:2>
<h> <bold> Protection </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#63:2>
Lotilla said the guidelines, which Neda prepared, would guarantee
the protection of so-called <mention> &ldquo; mom-and-pop &rdquo; businesses
</mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#64:2>
He explained that the selection of foreign firms would be based
on the track record of the applicants in their respective countries of origin
to ensure that only quality retailers would be allowed to operate here. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#65:2>
Both the House of Representatives and the Senate have agreed in
principle on the retail trade liberalization bill. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#66:2>
Some issues however still have to be settled, including minimum
capitalization, level of equity ownership, and the time limit on the
100-percent equity ownership privilege. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#67:2>
<h> <bold> Clashing views </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#68:2>
Various parties are leaning toward a &peso;100-million minimum
capitalization for 100-percent equity ownership. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#69:2>
The Department of Trade and Industry ( DTI), on the other hand,
has proposed a minimum capitalization of &peso;80 million for 100-percent
equity ownership but limited this to a period of two years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#70:2>
Under this proposal, applicants after the two-year period would
not be able to enjoy the 100-percent equity ownership privilege anymore and
would have to settle for a maximum of 60 percent only. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#71:2>
But NEDA has taken the opposite stand.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#72:2>
It wants to stick to the &peso;100-million minimum capitalization and
completely eliminate the time limit. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#73:2>
Lotilla expressed his concern that putting limits on the level of
equity ownership and the time frame might discourage foreign firms from
coming in. </p>

<quote> &ldquo; It is high time that we opened up retail trade.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#76:2>
Liberalization must be genuine and not a pseudo liberalization where
you can make things difficult, &rdquo; </quote> Lotilla said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#77:2>
In comparison, the retail trade sector of the other Asian
economies such as Indonesia offers wholesale and retail trade of up to
100-percent foreign equity ownership in addition to 100-percent equity in all
areas of the manufacturing sector. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#78:2>
In Thailand, the promotion of the retail trade sector is limited
to expansion projects.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#79:2>
A 100-percent foreign equity is also allowed but subject to various
conditions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#80:2>
Lotilla also noted that prospects for a speedy approval of the
trade liberalization bill remain very good considering that President Estrada
has given his full support to the piece of legislation. </p>

<h> <bold> Socialized housing gets same budget, Palace says </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#84:3>
SOCIALIZED housing will continue to get 80 percent of the funding
allocated by the Estrada administration for its mass shelter program,
Malaca&ntilde;ang assured the public yesterday. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#85:3>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora clarified that there has been
no attempt to shift the focus of the administration 's housing program
despite the imminent entry of private developers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#86:3>
<quote> <X> <indig> <it> &ldquo; Walang pagbabago </it> </indig>
( No change). </X>

There 's no attempt to reverse the percentages ( of housing
allotment)," </quote> Zamora said in a radio interview. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#88:3>
Even if private developers entered the housing program, he added,
they would follow market forces, which are likely to show that most
prospective homeowners want socialized housing. </p> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#89:3>
Under the present housing program, socialized housing would get 80
percent of the funding for shelter, while low-cost housing would get the
remaining 20 percent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#90:3>
<quote> &ldquo; I don't think it will move far from 80-20.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#91:3>
As I see it, developers will follow the market forces, and most of
the market is really in that 80 percent bracket, &rdquo; </quote> he said.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#92:3>
The socialized housing program offers the most affordable housing
units costing &peso;180,000 and below. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#93:3>
Fears of a change in focus surfaced after Karina David resigned
last week as chairman of the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating
Council ( HUDCC). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#94:3>
President Estrada in his radio program <indig> &ldquo; Itawag Mo
Kay Erap &rdquo; </indig> raised the possibility that he may appoint a
replacement for David, citing the importance accorded by his administration
to the socialized housing program.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#95:3>
In the interim, the President has assumed David 's post. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#96:3>
<quote> &ldquo; Probably, because I have a heavy work load and we
need someone to closely oversee the socialized housing program.

President said when asked whether he plans to appoint a new HUDCC chief. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#98:3>
Meanwhile, Zamora said President Estrada 's order to lower
interest rates signals the start of stepped up efforts by the government to
put a roof over the heads of the homeless. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#99:3>
The President ordered Tuesday the lowering of interest rates for
socialized housing from 16 percent to nine percent for loans with 30-year
terms covering housing units worth &peso;180,000 or less. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#100:3>
Zamora said Malaca&ntilde;ang is hopeful Congress would approve
additional capitalization for the Home Insurance Guaranty Corp ( HIGC), from
&peso;2 billion to &peso;50 billion. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#101:3>
<quote> &ldquo; We need a lot more money for housing, and one of
the ways is by allowing HIGC to guarantee more, &rdquo; </quote> he said in a
radio interview. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#102:3>
According to Zamora, the President aims to construct up to
400,000 housing units every year in the next five years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#103:3>
Mr. Estrada also moved to bring down the monthly amortization
for socialized housing units by ordering that additional amortization support
be given through the <indig> Abot Kaya Pabahay </indig> Program. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#104:3>
In addition, he instructed the <indig> PAG-IBIG </indig> / Home
Mutual Fund Corp. and Home Insurance and Guarantee Corp. to immediately make
available to government employees housing units that have remained unoccupied
up to now. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#105:3>
Determined to give the poor a decent shelter of their own during
his term, the President has assumed the post of housing <foreign> czar

<h> <bold> Cronyism is dead, President assures </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#107:4>
PRESIDENT Estrada reiterated yesterday that cronyism is dead and
buried in his administration, saying none of his so-called cronies have
received monetary assistance for their businesses from any government
financing institutions ( GFIs).

<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#108:4>
In his weekly radio program <indig> &ldquo; Itawag Mo Kay Erap,
&rdquo; </indig> the President said those who doubt his word can check
government documents to see for themselves if his administration has extended
loans and other financial aid to the business ventures of his alleged
cronies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#109:4>
Mr. Estrada also refused to give a negative spin to the reported
statement regarding cronyism of Vice-President Gloria Arroyo before East
Asian economic and political leaders in a forum in Singapore. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#110:4>
Arroyo was reported to have said in a press conference following
her speech at the East Asia Economic Summit that cronyism is not good
governance but stressed that President Estrada has consistently made it clear
that no government favors were given to businessmen perceived to be close to
him, like Lucio Tan of Philippine Airlines ( PAL), Eduardo Cojuangco of San
Miguel Corp. ( SMC), and Mark Jimenez. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#111:4>
<quote> &ldquo; The Vice-President noted that as I have

favor from the government, &rdquo; </quote> Mr. Estrada said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#113:4>
<quote> &ldquo; Since I assumed the presidency, neither
Cojuangco nor Tan was able to get a single cent of concession or loans from

<quote> &ldquo; So there is no cronyism in my administration.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#115:4>
This is a documented fact, and they can inspect the records of GFIs,
&rdquo; </quote> he added. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#116:4>
In the case of Tan, the President had rejected appeals by the
businessman to bail out the hemorrhaging PAL in line with his policy against
using public money to subsidize distressed private firms. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-013#117:4>
The President had also made it clear that Cojuangco was able to
regain control of the SMC board not because of the latter 's alleged Palace
connection but because he was voted as chairman by board members appointed by
the previous administration. </p> </I>
