 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#1:1:A>
The last time we met we were talking about space the different kinds of space and the metaphysical uh consequences of these
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#2:1:A>
We said that uh metaphysics or the problems of metaphysics were born essentially in the context of the general perception of space as Euclidean
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#3:1:A>
We said that Euclidean space is structureless and empty
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#4:1:A>
In it the application of uh the Parmenidian postulates results in <,> uh a an ontology which begins with non-being and ends with non-being
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#5:1:A>
Therefore humans especially philosophical humans who encounter things in space are surprised why there are things rather than nothing and therefore uh are moved to search for explanations for the things in space
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#6:1:A>
The analogy there is with uh a blank screen a blank movie screen without contents in it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#7:1:A>
Now supposing we have uh a movie in the movie screen but we cannot find any projector anywhere nor anything behind the screen we would wonder why there is a movie going on without any projector projecting anything on the screen
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#8:1:A>
The uh question we would ask would be similar to the question we ask why is there something rather than nothing 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#9:1:A>
However we said that uh in non-Euclidean space the existence of things in space specifically space-time <,> uh changing and with the history <,> would be unnatural
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#10:1:A>
We have therefore a mind which expects Euclidean space to be there okay <,> and wonders why there are things in this
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#11:1:A>
We ask for an explanation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#12:1:A>
We did not realize that the space we had was the Euclidean
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#13:1:A>
As a matter of fact the mind has thought for a long time that Euclidean space is the only possible space
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#14:1:A>
It was only in the eighteenth nineteenth century that the idea of non-Euclidean space is <,> became uh <O> cough </O> uh perceivable through the efforts of <unclear> name </unclear> uh <unclear> name </unclear> and <unclear> name </unclear> and finally by <unclear> name </unclear> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#15:1:A>
This is a happy thing for philosophy particularly when Einstein came along and deduced from from uh his theory that space-time <unclear> word </unclear> space-time would have contents not only contents but contents which interact with each other and which interact with space-time itself
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#16:1:A>
Okay there were problems of course with the with the uh relativity
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#17:1:A>
And one of the problems of relativity was its seeming uh conflict classical conflict with quantum mechanics which uh relativity we said was deterministic while quantum mechanics is essentially indeterministic
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#18:1:A>
And the two would not be reconciled until in recent years uh we came up with super strings and perhaps super membrane uh space-time <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#19:1:A>
Okay uh so it seems that uh the ontological question is no longer impossible to solve
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#20:1:A>
William James had believed that there was no bridge between being and non-being and that was because William James although he lived in the twentieth century was not able to connect relativity with existence
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#21:1:A>
Similarly uh Alfred North Whitehead also made almost the same almost the same remark
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#22:1:A>
He said there is no reason why this flux history
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#23:1:A>
This flux rather than another flux has been illustrated apart from history
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#24:1:A>
In other words apart from the given uh forces of nature already there without this given given history and no reasons can be given why a particular history rather than another history has been illustrated
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#25:1:A>
Okay now we shall uh go on to another problem in philosophy and this is the problem of causality
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#26:1:A>
Somehow instinctively men have believed that events have causes that no events can take place without a cause
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#27:1:A>
This was the conclusion of such uh pre-Socratic philosophers as Parmenides and Anaxamander uh Leucippus Democritus Plato Aristotle and so forth
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#28:1:A>
Democritus uh put it uh succinctly as follows <quote> nothing happens without a cause or reason </quote> <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#29:1:A>
Okay whenever something happens we always ask what 's the cause <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#30:1:A>
What is the cause
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#31:1:A>
In other words it seems that belief in causality is ingrained in the human mind <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#32:1:A>
Kant uh believed that uh powers to perceive causal relationships are also ingrained but he said it is ingrained in the categories <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#33:1:A>
The categories the structures of the mind which by which we experience an orderly universe
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#34:1:A>
Kant believed that it is impossible for anyone to experience a completely disorderly universe
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#35:1:A>
The only universe that can be <.> exp </.> experienced are is a universe that is orderly and the ordering apparatus are the categories <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#36:1:A>
Okay let us first uh explain them the two current uh <,> hypotheses about causality
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#37:1:A>
The first one who came up with a hypothesis about causality was of course David Hume <indig> 'no </indig> <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#38:1:A>
David Hume was an empiricist <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#39:1:A>
He followed in the tradition of John Locke <,> Berkeley George Berkeley and finally himself David Hume
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#40:1:A>
Now David Hume following his tradition and then bringing this to the logical conclusion his logical conclusion uh thought <indig> 'no </indig> that the materials of our knowledge are essentially two <indig> 'no </indig> ultimately reducible to one namely impressions and ideas
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#41:1:A>
Impressions come first then ideas <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#42:1:A>
Simple ideas must have an uh antecedents in simple impressions
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#43:1:A>
You cannot for example think of the color red unless you have seen the color red before
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#44:1:A>
If you are born color blind you will not know what redness then is
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#45:1:A>
If you are born without the sense of pain you would not know what pain is
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#46:1:A>
But you can having these simple ideas you are able then to combine them <indig> 'no </indig> into complex ideas which you may not have experienced before <indig> 'no </indig> because of the imagination
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#47:1:A>
The mind has two powers imagination and memory
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#48:1:A>
Memory in memory okay we have ideas of things we have experienced in orderly sequence
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#49:1:A>
But in imagination the ideas may be jumbled <indig> 'no </indig> in any order we wish
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#50:1:A>
That 's why we are able to write fiction
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#51:1:A>
We are able to draw strange characters <indig> 'no </indig> <foreign> etcetera etcetera </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#52:1:A>
The although in imagination the mind is free to combine ideas anyway it wants <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#53:1:A>
Nevertheless there are certain tendencies of the mind which uh make it tend to associate certain ideas with each other <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#54:1:A>
It 's the law of association okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#55:1:A>
And the laws of association are governed by three mechanisms contiguity in other words two ideas closely associated with each other okay uh become so associated that the existence of one the impression of one will involve the other contiguity <,> resemblance <,> two ideas which resemble each other recall each other and the third one is cause and effect
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#56:1:A>
This is the one we are interested in cause and effect
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#57:1:A>
Cause and effect again is uh associated through constant conjunction
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#58:1:A>
Cause and effect is associated through constant conjunction

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#59:1:B>
Sir

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#60:1:A>
So that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#61:1:B>
Sir <indig> 'yong </indig> uh so uh <unclear> words </unclear> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#62:1:A>
Three three mechanisms <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#63:1:A>
Okay uh <,> contiguity <,> resemblance and cause and effect okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#64:1:A>
In the process of the constant conjunction of ideas the happening of impression the happening of one impression recalls the other <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#65:1:A>
Okay whether the one that is uh previous that the antecedent one is called a cause and the uh what was the other of antecedent
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#66:1:A>
Antecedent and <,> I forgot it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#67:1:A>
It 's not consequent
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#68:1:A>
<mention> Consequent </mention> is a logical term
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#69:1:A>
Anyway the one that follows is called the uh <unclear> word </unclear> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#70:1:A>
Now since David Hume was an empiricist he wanted very much to analyze just what from the viewpoint of empiricism are the elements of causality <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#71:1:A>
Okay he was able to distinguish three elements namely succession
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#72:1:A>
There is a succession of events <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#73:1:A>
Uh let us say for example you have a you want to smoke a cigarette you want to light your cigarette <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#74:1:A>
Alright there 's a succession of events
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#75:1:A>
You get your lighter <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#76:1:A>
Flip it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#77:1:A>
The lighter uh uh lights up okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#78:1:A>
You bring the light to the lighter to your cigarette and it comes in contact with the cigarette
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#79:1:A>
Okay the cigarette lights okay and you blow out the light of the lighter
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#80:1:A>
That 's it <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#81:1:A>
Okay a succession succession of events <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#82:1:A>
A succession of events okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#83:1:A>
The second one is <mention> contiguity </mention> <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#84:1:A>
Contiguity contiguity according to David Hume is an element in causality <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#85:1:A>
The cause must come in contact with the effect <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#86:1:A>
The cause must come in contact with the effect
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#87:1:A>
Okay the light the <.> fir </.> the flame of the lighter must come in contact with the cigarette before the cigarette will light <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#88:1:A>
We somehow believe that gravity also exhibits this kind of of uh property <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#89:1:A>
There is in other words for Hume no such thing as an action at a distance <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#90:1:A>
It 's always some kind of <,> of contact between the cause and the effect
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#91:1:A>
Yet it

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#92:1:C>
Uh what what governs the law of association 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#93:1:A>
The law of association

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#94:1:C>
Yes what were what are the <unclear> words </unclear> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#95:1:A>
Oh what governs it what governs it

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#96:1:C>
Resemblance of

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#97:1:A>
Oh okay resemblance uh contiguity resemblance contiguity

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#98:1:C>
The same definition

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#99:1:A>
<indig> Oo oo </indig> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#100:1:C>
The same definition

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#101:1:A>
The same definition
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#102:1:A>
They are close together <,> closely associated with each other
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#103:1:A>
Contiguity
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#104:1:A>
Okay I guess I guess in causality the contiguity means contact <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#105:1:A>
Physical contact <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#106:1:A>
The contiguity in causality means physical contact
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#107:1:A>
In the former one I guess contiguity means close association
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#108:1:A>
Okay the third element is necessary connection <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#109:1:A>
The third element is necessary connection
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#110:1:A>
So we have succession of events contiguity necessary connection
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#111:1:A>
Okay supposing supposing I throw this piece of chalk
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#112:1:A>
Let us say this is a piece of rock <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#113:1:A>
This is a piece of rock and this is a piece of glass
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#114:1:A>
Supposing now I throw this piece of chalk to the piece of glass
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#115:1:A>
There 's a succession of events <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#116:1:A>
The glass breaks <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#117:1:A>
The glass glass breaks upon contiguity <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#118:1:A>
Upon contact <indig> 'no </indig> alright okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#119:1:A>
And then the necessary connection is I believe now that it was the contact of the rock with the glass that broke the glass <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#120:1:A>
Alright <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#121:1:A>
It broke the glass okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#122:1:A>
So he now analyzed where this necessary connection comes from <indig> 'no </indig> where this necessary connection comes from because it seemed that from the viewpoint of empiricism it has no objective basis
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#123:1:A>
He thinks that <,> I could just as much believe that upon contact with the piece of glass the glass will harden rather than break <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#124:1:A>
Or upon contact with my cigarette the cigarette the cigarette will will freeze rather than burn <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#125:1:A>
So there is no logical connection between the cause and effect
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#126:1:A>
The necessary connection then is not logical but psychological <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#127:1:A>
It 's not a logical connection
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#128:1:A>
It is a psychological connection
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#129:1:A>
I have no impression in other words according to Hume of a necessary connection between the cause and the effect <indig> 'no </indig> 
ICE-PHI:S1B-008#126> Okay so he says then then <indig> 'no </indig> that the element of necessary connection is due <indig> 'no </indig> not so much to the logical connection between cause and effect but to habit and custom <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#130:1:A>
The constant conjunction of events between cause and effect creates a habit in the mind okay to associate the two so that the happening of one will cause the other whether the effect or the cause
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#131:1:A>
You have an effect you recall the cause
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#132:1:A>
You have the cause you think of the effect <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#133:1:A>
It is the habit that establishes the psychological feeling that there must be a necessary connection between the cause and the effect <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#134:1:A>
This is a <.> comple </.> completely empiricistic analysis of causality
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#135:1:A>
And that in short gives you the Humeian concept of causality
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#136:1:A>
Causality is not an objective relation between things
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#137:1:A>
It is a subjective <.> imposit </.> you might say imposition <indig> 'no </indig> by the mind on the world
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#138:1:A>
As far as the world is concerned the objective world is concerned things could happen differently <indig> 'no </indig> than what the mind expects uh things to do uh to happen
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#139:1:A>
Okay now uh Kant of course we all know that Kant read this book of David Hume and Kant one of you know was a dogmatist
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#140:1:A>
He when after reading it he said David Hume 's book had uh awakened him from his dogmatic slumber <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#141:1:A>
Okay he got some important ideas from David Hume called causality but he did not agree with Hume <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#142:1:A>
He did not agree with Hume that causality is due to mere habit <indig> 'no </indig> engendered by the constant conjunction of impressions
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#143:1:A>
<indig> Ang kanya naman sabi niya </indig> there seems to be an element of universality and necessity in the cause and effect relation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#144:1:A>
If it were merely a case of habit and custom there would be no sense of universality and uh necessity
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#145:1:A>
So he said where then is the locus of this feeling of necessity
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#146:1:A>
Is it in the habit
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#147:1:A>
He agreed with Hume that it is subjective <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#148:1:A>
The locus of this feeling of necessity is not objective but subjective
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#149:1:A>
He says it must also be subjective <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#150:1:A>
But it 's not habit
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#151:1:A>
It 's not custom
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#152:1:A>
It must be an innate structure of the mind <indig> 'no </indig> which he identified as two <indig> 'no </indig> the intuitions composed of time and space and the categories composed of twelve categories one of which is causality <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#153:1:A>
In other words causality is a category of the mind
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#154:1:A>
This category of the mind <indig> 'no </indig> imposes itself upon the phenomena so that we necessarily think in terms of cause and effect <indig> 'no </indig> that the world is necessarily ordered
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#155:1:A>
In other words the orderliness of the universe the laws of nature <indig> 'no </indig> are necessary
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#156:1:A>
They cannot be altered <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#157:1:A>
But the necessity is not out there
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#158:1:A>
The necessity is in the mind <indig> 'no </indig> through the operation of the categories
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#159:1:A>
<indig> 'Yan 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-008#160:1:A>
So we have two different uh theories about causality 

 </I>
