<h> <bold> Debate surrounds management of menopause </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#4:1>
AT 52, Sunshine ( not her real name) started experiencing hot
flushes, sleepless nights and dizziness.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#5:1>
Her monthly period stopped. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#6:1>
The mother of four was entering menopause. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#7:1>
Other symptoms of the life phase also started consuming
her--irritability, nausea and anxiety. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#8:1>
Alarmed that her condition would worsen, Sunshine, a
businesswoman, asked her obstetrician-gynecologist to relieve her of the
uneasiness and discomfort.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#9:1>
The doctor recommended the hormone replacement therapy ( HRT).

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#10:1>
Sunshine was given a good dosage of Premarin, an oral medication
which is an adequate source of estrogen. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#11:1>
In three months, Sunshine was back to her normal self. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#12:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I can sleep well, I have no more hot flushes and
no more sweating at night, &rdquo; </quote> says Sunshine.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#13:1>
Although she continues to take the medicine on her doctor 's advice,
she is no longer worried about her body 's future. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#14:1>
<mention> &ldquo; Oh No, It 's Johnny! &rdquo; </mention>
producer Roselle Rebano, 49, started missing her menstrual period in early
1996; it stopped entirely in April that year.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#15:1>
Like Sunshine, she has one-minute hot flushes which recur after two
to three hours, mood swings and sometimes, depression. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#16:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I feel I 'm not normal, &rdquo; </quote>
complains Rebano, who has three children.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#17:1>
To make the people around her understand what she 's going through,
<quote> &ldquo; I announced to everyone in the office that I 'm menopausal.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#18:1>
Rebano has heard of the various health risks menopause brings,
such as heart disease and osteoporosis, a disease of the bones.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#19:1>
She has consulted her OB-Gyne who also advised her to undergo HRT.
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#20:1>
<h> <bold> Controversy </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#21:1>
However, Rebano has also learned about the side effects of HRT.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#22:1>
She 's now in a dilemma--to go through HRT or not. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#23:1>
Hormone replacement therapy confuses many women today.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#24:1>
It also confounds most doctors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#25:1>
HRT has been in the Philippines for more than two decades now.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#26:1>
In the United States, many postmenopausal women are into HRT. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#27:1>
HRT, however, has been bombarded with controversies about its
side effects.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#28:1>
When not properly defined and administered, it could cost a woman her
life. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#29:1>
HRT used to be called estrogen replacement therapy ( ERT).

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#30:1>
Estrogen is the basic hormone that becomes deficient when a woman
becomes menopausal.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#31:1>
The moment a woman is estrogen deficient, she develops a lot of
physical and psychological problems. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#32:1>
In women, the loss of estrogen manifests itself through acute and
long-term symptoms.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#33:1>
About 75 percent of women experience acute menopausal symptoms like
hot flushes, headaches, sleepless nights, strange skin sensations, and
palpitations.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#34:1>
For some women, these symptoms are insignificant.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#35:1>
For others, they are manageable.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#36:1>
But for many, they make life miserable. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#37:1>
A hot flush brings a feeling of intense heat that envelops the
body, usually from the waist up and especially the face and neck.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#38:1>
The blood vessels on the skin 's surface dilate, causing a rosy
flush.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#39:1>
In most cases the flush is accompanied by profuse perspiration.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#40:1>
A hot flush is often sensed a few seconds before it occurs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#41:1>
Psychoneurologic symptoms, such as panic attacks, mood swings,
anxiety, irritability, poor memory, and poor concentration increase after
menopause.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#42:1>
Estrogen-deficiency in postmenopausal women may also contribute to
the degeneration of the central nervous system. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#43:1>
After a few years, more symptoms appear.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#44:1>
Women suffer what is known as urogenital atrophy, which causes
difficulty in urination, dryness of the vagina which makes intercourse
painful, and loss of libido. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#45:1>
Other changes include breast tenderness, abdominal bloating, and
leg cramps. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#46:1>
The long-term effects are more life-threatening.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#47:1>
Loss of natural estrogens during menopause puts women at increased
risk of cardiovascular disease, the most common cause of death worldwide
among postmenopausal women.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#48:1>
Other dangers are osteoporosis and Alzheimer 's disease. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#49:1>
<h> <bold> Hormone replacement </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#50:1>
Today, ERT is called HRT because there are two hormones involved
in the therapy--estrogen and progesterone. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#51:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Doctors have realized that some women need not
only estrogen but progesterone as well, &rdquo; </quote> says Dr. Delfin A.
Tan, president of the United Doctors Medical Center and a fellow of the
Philippine Obstetrical and Gynecological Society. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#52:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Basically, women who still have their uterus
intact will need both estrogen and progesterone," </quote> he adds.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#53:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Those who have their uterus removed, for one reason
or another, don't need progesterone anymore. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#54:1>
HRT is supposed to help women delay all the possible risks of
menopause.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#55:1>
HRT restores estrogen levels in the body. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#56:1>
Menopause occurs between the 40s and 50s.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#57:1>
The youngest menopausal women could be less than 30 years old.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#58:1>
Dr. Tan had a 26-year-old menopausal patient, but it 's a very rare
case.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#59:1>
The oldest he 's known was 57. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#60:1>
Menopause marks a woman 's last menstrual flow.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#61:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Before you say a woman is menopausal she should have
missed her period for at least one year," </quote> says Dr. Tan.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#62:1>
<quote> &ldquo; But let 's say you had your menstruation thrice a
year, that 's not menopause. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#63:1>
<h> <bold> Safe? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#64:1>
Hormone therapy can take the form of <unclear> .... </unclear>
skin patches, or injections.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#65:1>
The most common form is oral.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#66:1>
Tablets and capsules are widely available in drugstores, and they 're
more popular because they 're convenient and said to be more effective. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#67:1>
There have been heated arguments, here and abroad, about the
effectivity and side effects of HRT.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#68:1>
Studies have shown that menopausal women who take hormones could have
higher risk of breast cancer and endometrial cancer, which strikes the lining
of the uterus. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#69:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The influence of hormone therapy on breast cancer
risk is uncertain despite numerous studies, &rdquo; </quote> says Dr. Tan.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#70:1>
<quote> &ldquo; There 's still no agreement on the effect of HRT on
risk of breast cancer.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#71:1>
Recent evidence indicates no substantial increase in breast cancer
risk for women who take estrogen in the recommended doses. &rdquo; </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#72:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The issue has not been settled.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#73:1>
If there are side effects these are very slight.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#74:1>
But the benefits you get from these hormones will be much more than
the possible side effects. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#75:1>
Besides, he adds, women can develop breast cancer even when they 're
not taking estrogen. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#76:1>
But Tan notes that taking estrogen for a long period of time may
actually lead to endometrial cancer.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#77:1>
To avert this, doctors prescribe progesterone. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#78:1>
<quote> &ldquo; You can develop endometrial cancer whether you
take estrogen or not, &rdquo; </quote> he stresses.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#79:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Taking estrogen correctly combined with progesterone,
the second major female hormone--will not increase your chances of uterine
cancer and actually protect you from it. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#80:1>
Estrogen and progesterone won't harm women.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#81:1>
In fact, they can dramatically improve quality of life.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#82:1>
They can add years to life and well-being to the body. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#83:1>
<quote> &ldquo; If your uterus is intact, you need estrogen as
well as progesterone, &rdquo; </quote> Tan says.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#84:1>
<quote> &ldquo; But if you don't have a uterus anymore, you don't
need progesterone. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#85:1>
The benefits far outweigh the risks of hormone therapy, according
to the doctor.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#86:1>
<quote> <indig> &ldquo; Wala namang buhay sa mundo na walang risks,
&rdquo; </indig> </quote> he says. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#87:1>
Unlike estrogen which should be taken everyday, progesterone is
given cyclically, say 10 days a month. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#88:1>
Some problems, like bleeding, can develop.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#89:1>
<quote> &ldquo; But bleeding generally disappears when you continue
the medication. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<h> <bold> Quality of life </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#91:1>
The fact that estrogen therapy is safe should not send every
menopausal woman to her doctor and ask for it.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#92:1>
Many women don't need it, and some won't take it even if they need
it.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#93:1>
Many women can manage without it.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#94:1>
Some require only a short-term help from estrogen, just enough for
their bodies to adjust to the changes in hormone levels that occur during
menopause. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#95:1>
In the case of Sunshine, she was advised to continue taking the
hormones.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#96:1>
<quote> &ldquo; What we are preparing for are the late complications
like osteoporosis and heart ailments, &rdquo; </quote> explains Tan.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#97:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Osteoporosis is a serious problem.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#98:1>
It 's a silent disease.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#99:1>
It can strike anytime, even when you don't feel anything.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#100:1>
HRT should be applied for prevention. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

Tan is a member of the Philippine Society of Climacteric
Medicine ( <mention> climacteric </mention> is a synonym for <mention>
menopause </mention> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#102:1>
Other society members are cardiologists, surgeons, psychiatrists,
rheumatologists, and physical therapists, among others.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#103:1>
Formed in 1992, it aims to study menopause in men and women,
disseminate knowledge and information about menopause, coordinate research
about menopause in the Philippines. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#104:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The Philippines started late as far as menopause
is concerned, &rdquo; </quote> says Tan.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#105:1>
In general, Asian countries are a little late in understanding the
problems of menopause, compared with Western and European countries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#106:1>
Orientals are not as dramatic as Westerners in reacting to
menopause.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#107:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Why would you complain when a bigger problem is how
to earn enough money to buy three square meals a day, &rdquo; </quote> notes
Tan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#108:1>
Often, the people most concerned about menopause are those in
the A and B classes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#109:1>
The hormone dosages given to menopausal women vary.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#110:1>
Some women need more, some less.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#111:1>
But the standard estrogen brand and dosage used is Premarin at 0.625
mg. daily. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#112:1>
<h> <bold> Expensive </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#113:1>
HRT is expensive.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#114:1>
One bottle of 100 tablets of Premarin can cost from &peso;1,000 to
&peso;1,200.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#115:1>
It is taken once a day, 365 days a year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#116:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Remember, a menopausal woman is
estrogen-deficient for the rest of her life, &rdquo; </quote> says Tan.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#117:1>
<quote> &ldquo; HRT is very popular these days, but not everybody
can afford it. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#118:1>
Fortunately, HRT is not the only cure for postmenopausal women.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#119:1>
It 's just part of postmenopausal management. </p>

<quote> &ldquo; When you have a baby, you bring the baby to a
doctor for vaccinations and regular check-up to keep the baby healthy,

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#121:1>
<quote> &ldquo; When you 're pregnant, you go to a doctor for
prenatal care even if you 're not sick.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#122:1>
So, why shouldn't postmenopausal woman get treatment? &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#123:1>
Menopausal women, whether or not they 're into HRT, should visit
their doctors at least once a year for regular check-ups or tests like pap
smear, pelvic ultrasound and mammography.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#124:1>
A pap smear will show if anything is wrong with the cervix.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#125:1>
A pelvic ultrasound will reveal the condition of the endometrium.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#126:1>
Mammography helps detect developing breast lumps. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#127:1>

<quote> &ldquo; Some gynecologists here are cancer-conscious,
which is also good, &rdquo; </quote> he adds.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#131:1>
<quote> &ldquo; But it affects their way of thinking and their
practice.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#132:1>
To some extent, we have educated a good majority of gynecologists.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#133:1>
Many of them are now willing to practice HRT. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-027#134:1>
Most HRT patients, Tan adds, are in the medical field
themselves. </p> </I>
