<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#3:1>
<h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#4:1>
To derive the most from Asian philosophy, it is imperative to
assume an attitude which I call an <it> attitudinal imperative </it> - - and
this is <it> to understand </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#5:1>
In understanding, one must put away all complexes, whether of
superiority or of inferiority.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#6:1>
Olivier Lacombe, long recognized as an authority on Indian philosophy,
is emphatic on this point - - <quote> &ldquo; Away with inferiority and
superiority complexes, the cancers of sick minds. &rdquo; </quote> <fnr> <sp>
1 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#7:1>
And Lacombe continues that <quote> &ldquo; more deeply than our
quality of being oriental or occidental is our quality of being human.
&rdquo; </quote> <fnr> <sp> 2 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#8:1>
Lacombe says that our lack of understanding stems from the fact that
we have tarried on the surface of ourselves, implying that we have missed the
essential and the deeply human. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#9:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The universality of human nature implies the power
and the duty to communicate from one culture to another, &rdquo; </quote> and
hence, whether we are from the East or from the West, we can penetrate into
the core of human nature and there discover essentials.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#10:1>
On the depth-level of human nature, Lacombe seems to tell us that
there are no differences anymore.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#11:1>
If on the surface we appear to be dissimilar, this is only because we
have stayed on the peripheral level.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#12:1>
The truth is that the similarities among men are more real than
apparent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#13:1>
There are, however, gross differences between East and West which
should be accepted as axiomatic from the very start. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#14:1>
First, the Western mind thinks in a linear manner.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#15:1>
The Occidental man invariably thinks in terms of time, as beginning
and end, and his concept of eternity is but an extension of the end to an
invisible no-end, and of the beginning, into an unknown no-beginning.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#16:1>
The Asian, on the other hand, thinks of time in a cyclic manner.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#17:1>
For him, the beginning and end of events or of individuals are but
links in a chain of beginning-ends where the end of one immediately gives
rise to another beginning in a perpetual manner.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#18:1>
Nothing really ends; nothing really begins absolutely.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#19:1>
Once in existence, always in existence, and a non-existent will never
become, but will remain forever in the bosom of nothingness. <fnr> <sp> 3
</sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#20:1>
Thus the Western mind thinks naturally of creation at the
beginning of the world of things and an annihilation at the end of the same
world of things.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#21:1>
The Asian mind summarily dismisses absolute creation and absolute
annihilation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#22:1>
The fact that things exist <it> now </it> is an indication that they
have <it> always </it> existed.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#23:1>
They were never lifted from nothing into something by way of
creation, and they will never cease to be; they will always exist in a
different mode of disposition. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#24:1>
The concept of all-at-once-ness which is the hallmark of the mind
of Asia is annoying to the Western mind which cannot shake off its structural
mode of thinking in terms of beginning and end, of before and after, of then
and now and later.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#25:1>
This is no doubt applicable to individual things and events which the
Asian mind does not reject, but when the line of reasoning and understanding
is raised from the fragmentary to the total, from the piecemeal to the whole,
from the part to the All of the world of things, the Asian mind balks at the
&ldquo; illogic &rdquo; of applying the same principles pertaining only to
the fragments to that of the Whole. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#26:1>
At the very outset, this <it> <foreign> leitmotif </foreign>
</it> has to be grasped well because many concepts of Asian philosophy cannot
be understood without it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#27:1>
Second, there is no dichotomy between a way of life and a way of
thinking in Asia.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#28:1>
As one thinks, so one lives.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#29:1>
Religion, or a way of life, is not polarized from philosophy, which
is a way of thinking.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#30:1>
Religion and philosophy in Asia are one.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#31:1>
No gap exists between philosophy and life, between contemplation and
action, between theory and practice.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#32:1>
And this is perhaps the reason philosophical theory had not soared as
high as it did and still does in the West for, commensurate to theory, the
Asian must accomplish in practice, which is not easy.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#33:1>
The West has but to theorize and speculate; no application to life is
necessary.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#34:1>
Such are the Platonic, Hegelian, Kantian, Fichtean theories to which
the Western philosophers render lip service; their application to practice is
still being contested by other Western philosophers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#35:1>
This is at once a boon as it is a setback.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#36:1>
By being allowed to speculate and soar into the skies of theory and
hypothesis, one discovers new vistas, new horizons, new perspectives, whereas
by being tied down to life practices, one is necessarily held back by their
gravitational pull.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#37:1>
Is this the reason the West has continuously discovered new avenues
of medicine, new knowledge regarding planets, new ways of multiplying harvest
as against the paucity in the East of the same blessings?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#38:1>
This is, however, also a setback.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#39:1>
The cleavage between theory and practice, between philosophy and
life, between a hypothesis and its application leads to frustration and to a
split-level personality.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#40:1>
One has to make do with a bundle of theories, beautiful to behold but
hollow and meaningless because inapplicable.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#41:1>
Where do we find the most unhappiness that leads to suicides and
insanity but in the West?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#42:1>
What about the by-product of new scientific discoveries and
progressive techniques like pollution, which is a threat to humanity? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#43:1>
There is more peace in the Asian <foreign> psyche </foreign>
because of the absence of this split-level disposition but, of course, at the
expense of hunger and privation and grinding poverty.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#44:1>
There is no pollution except in industrialized cities, it is true,
but there is hardly economic progress and even philosophical advancement
either.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#45:1>
Keeping theory and practice together contributes to individual peace
of mind, for one experiences no anguish brought about by a dual standard; yet
it also hampers productivity in the face of Asia 's burgeoning population.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#46:1>
Religion in Asia is a way of life; it is sacrosanct.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#47:1>
It is not accurate to judge that Asia is poor because of religion.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#48:1>
It is poor because it cannot accept the polarization of theory and
practice, of philosophy and religion, of its way of thinking and its way of
living.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#49:1>
If Asia could find a means of adjusting elusive theory with practice,
there is no reason why Asia cannot become progressive like the West.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#50:1>
This, of course, is an ideal. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#51:1>
Thirdly, the Asian mind resorts to intuition, if logic is no
longer able to solve a life problem.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#52:1>
From the very fact that it thinks in a cyclic all-at-once-ness, it
must resort to means other than the usual mental processes applicable to the
piecemeal and fragmentary.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#53:1>
One should not therefore be surprised at its propensity to mysticism,
at its use of super-consciousness, or of the existence of a third eye or a
sixth sense.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#54:1>
When the situation so demands, it reverses the logical patterns. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#55:1>
<h> <bold> THE MERGING CURRENTS: A DIFFERENT APPROACH </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#56:1>
If one were to use the systematic approach of the seven
disciplines in Western philosophy, namely psychology, ethics, theodicy,
epistemology, metaphysics, cosmology and logic, as bases of comparison
between Asian and Western philosophy, one would easily discern further
similarities and differences. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#57:1>
<h> <bold> A. PSYCHOLOGY </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#58:1>
1. In <it> psychology </it> , or the study of human nature, Asian
and Western thinkers have different perceptions regarding man.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#59:1>
In the West, man is looked upon as an individual, special and unique,
with definite specifications.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#60:1>
This individuality is based upon a personal set of characteristics
emanating from a soul that is his and his alone. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#61:1>
In Asia, man is looked upon as a speck in the universe of things;
hence, he does not possess the importance accorded him by the West.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#62:1>
His existence is merely a continuation of another existence in a long
and continuous chain of existence. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#63:1>
From the etymology <it> <foreign> psyche </foreign> </it> meaning
&ldquo; soul &rdquo; and <it> <foreign> logos </foreign> </it> meaning
&ldquo; word, &rdquo; one can gather that the Western preoccupation is the
duality of man.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#64:1>
Body and soul are the two components of the human person with the
difficulty of tying these two components into a single unity.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#65:1>
This is not always easy because one component is a material body and
the other is a spiritual soul. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#66:1>
All throughout the history of philosophy, this unity in duality
has always posed a problem.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#67:1>
Plato did not attempt to conjoin them.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#68:1>
He said that the soul of man inhabited the World of Ideas &ldquo; up
above the heavens &rdquo; while his body inhabited the sensible world below,
so that when the soul descended into the body for some unknown reason ( <it>
Phaedrus </it> ) , the soul started to forget what it used to know.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#69:1>
The body could only be looked upon as a sort of prison responsible
for pushing into oblivion those ideas or knowledge that the soul had known
while it was in the World of Ideas.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#70:1>
Plato never taught an indissoluble union between body and soul. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#71:1>
Aristotle did conjoin the body and soul of man in his Hylemorphic
( from <it> <foreign> hyle </foreign> </it> meaning &ldquo; matter", and <it>
<foreign> morphe </foreign> </it> meaning &ldquo; form") Doctrine.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#72:1>
He said that every being was made up of matter and form. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#73:1>
A table has its matter and form.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#74:1>
Matter can be of two kinds: prime or primary and secondary matter.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#75:1>
Prime or primary matter is the ingredient in all beings.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#76:1>
It cannot be created nor annihilated since it is a substratum, an
underlying substrate in all things.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#77:1>
Secondary matter is what is perceived as colored, textured, shaped.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#78:1>
The table 's secondary matter is its own bulk and weight, which can
be perceived by any of man 's five external senses.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#79:1>
Secondary matter can and does undergo changes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#80:1>
The table can be re-shaped, shortened, re-painted.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#81:1>
In this case, its form undergoes accidental changes such as from one
color to another, from one shape to another, from one size to another. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#82:1>
The table can also burn, in which case, a drastic change takes
place.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#83:1>
From the table, which is perceived, emerges another substance, called
<mention> ashes </mention> , which has an entirely different form.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#84:1>
In this case, it would seem that the substance table was annihilated
and in its place was created a new substance called <mention> ashes
</mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#85:1>
Aristotle 's Hylemorphic Doctrine similarly applies to the human
being.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#86:1>
The human person is made up of matter ( namely, the body), and the
form ( namely, the soul).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#87:1>
The body and soul together constitute the human being.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#88:1>
To Aristotle, contrary to Plato, the body is just as important as the
soul as a component of man.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#89:1>
If for Plato, the body is like a prison or a glass case that cuts
down the brilliance exuded by a candle - - in either case, a liability, for
Aristotle, the body is necessary if only in the acquisition of knowledge.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#90:1>
Aristotle believed that man 's soul at the moment of birth is a <it>
<foreign> tabula rasa </foreign> </it> , or a blank tablet, and the only way
to fill up this blank tablet is to allow the outside world to penetrate by
means of the bodily senses.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#91:1>
<quote> &ldquo; There is nothing in the mind without having been in
the senses &rdquo; </quote> is an important doctrine of Aristotle.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#92:1>
The only way to form ideas is by way of the senses gathering data
from outside reality.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#93:1>
Hence, the body is necessary as a contact point between the soul and
the material world. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#94:1>
This argument, however, will not be as convenient for proving the
immortality of the soul.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#95:1>
When man dies, would the soul die as well as the body?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#96:1>
The answer given is that the body dies but the soul does not.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#97:1>
Two proofs are given.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#98:1>
One is that of simplicity.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#99:1>
The soul is simple, i.e., it has no parts.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#100:1>
If death means the disintegration of parts, then the soul cannot die
because it has no parts to disintegrate.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#101:1>
The other proof is based on spirituality.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#102:1>
The soul is spiritual, i.e., it is non-material.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#103:1>
This argument is based on the principle of <quote> <it> <foreign>
Agere sequitur esse </foreign> </it> </quote> - - <quote> &ldquo; Action
follows essence. &rdquo; </quote> As the product is, so is its source.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#104:1>
As the fruit is, so its source is a fruit tree.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#105:1>
Man has spiritual activities like thinking and willing and therefore
man must have a spiritual component responsible for them.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#106:1>
The body is not spiritual.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#107:1>
Hence, it is the soul which is the source of all spiritual
activities.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#108:1>
A spiritual being, <it> <foreign> per se </foreign> </it> , is
immortal ( the word &ldquo; mortal &rdquo; comes from the Latin <it>
<foreign> mors </foreign> </it> meaning death, and the addition of the
&ldquo; im &rdquo; negates death, hence immortal means &ldquo; not capable of
dying").

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#109:1>
Therefore, the soul of man is immortal; it will outlive the body
after the latter dies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#110:1>
In the East, there is no difficulty in proving immortality.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#111:1>
To begin with, Eastern philosophers do not put any emphasis on the
duality of man 's nature.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#112:1>
Man is one <it> self </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#113:1>
This self is the <it> <foreign> atman </foreign> </it> and is the
seat of consciousness.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#114:1>
The <foreign> atman </foreign> is man 's deepest selfhood where man
is truly man.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#115:1>
Consciousness is never turned off even in sleep.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#116:1>
There might be levels of consciousness from man 's wakefulness to
man 's deepest sleep but this consciousness is never shut off.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#117:1>
An argument is that during sleep, man dreams, which is not possible
without a modicum of consciousness.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#118:1>
If so, even beyond death, this consciousness continues to exist
because it does not depend on the body but rather on the <foreign> atman
</foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#119:1>
2. The concept of freedom is another point of divergence in the
East and West.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#120:1>
In the West, freedom is such a valuable commodity that all of man 's
values center on this concept.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#121:1>
Guilt, responsibility, retribution, the noble and the ignoble,
depend upon freedom.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#122:1>
No ethics is possible without freedom as a <it> <foreign> sine qua
non </foreign> </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#123:1>
Justice cannot be meted out without ascertaining the existence of
freedom.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#124:1>
The Westerner prides himself in enjoying freedom to the point that
he has built his philosophies around this concept. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#125:1>
In the East, freedom does not merit any attention, nor is there
any lengthy discussion on freedom in any of the Eastern writings.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#126:1>
Intention and freedom are ruled out in the meting out of
retribution.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#127:1>
The reason could lie in the lack of freedom surrounding man 's
birth.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#128:1>
Indeed, counsel, advice and justice are founded on freedom, but of
what use are these when man is not free regarding his birth?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#129:1>
Man is just born <quote> without having been consulted </quote> as
the Existentialists say.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#130:1>
Man therefore has no choice of parents, place and date of birth,
bodily feature, mental power, physical capacity, etc.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#131:1>
Hence, when he is born into this world, his goals, ambitions,
desires, and propensities are already laid out by circumstances of his birth.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-009#132:1>
What than is the fuss over man 's freedom when he is not free
regarding the initial moment of his life? </p> </I>
