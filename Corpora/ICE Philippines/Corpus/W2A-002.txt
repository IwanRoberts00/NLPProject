<h> <bold> <indig> DALAWANG DULA NI CLARISSA SA ECOLOHIYA </indig> :
ECOLOGY AS LITERATURE AS COUNTER IDEOLOGICAL DISCOURSE </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#2:1>
<bold> Paz Verdades M. Santos </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#3:1>
In the book <it> Science and Literature </it> , Matthew Arnold
warns against a fictional educator who is likely to say <quote> &ldquo; he
who in his training has substituted literature and history for natural
science has chosen the less useful alternative &rdquo; </quote> ( Cadden and
Brownstown 1964:23). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#4:1>
One Bikol woman writer who is also a biology professor has
sacrificed neither field of study for the other as &ldquo; less useful.
&rdquo;

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#5:1>
In fact, she has packaged many of her science lessons in the literary
genre of drama.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#6:1>
This playwright is Clarissa Guadalupe a.k.a. Emelina Gagalac Regis,
1992 Palanca awardee for <indig> &ldquo; Dalawang Mukha ng Kagubatan </indig>
, &rdquo; one of two plays in <it> <indig> Dalawang Dula ni Clarissa sa
Ekolohiya </indig> </it> ( 1993). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#7:1>
Regis, associate professor of more than two decades at the Ateneo
de Naga, has a B.S. in Botany and an M.S. in Biology from U.P. and is
presently working on her Ph.D. in Biology at the same university.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#8:1>
It may come as a surprise to find out that this playwright has had no
other background or training in literature except for the usual courses in
high school and college.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#9:1>
But as science professor, founder of ecological groups, and much
sought after speaker on environmentalism, she has long been a dedicated
steward of the world.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#10:1>
She wrote &ldquo; <indig> Karagatan </indig> &rdquo; in 1988 and
&ldquo; <indig> Dalawang Mukha ng Kagubatan </indig> &rdquo; in 1990, as
contest pieces for the student group she moderated and for her outreach
environmental campaigns.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#11:1>
Since she could not find an environmental play, she decided to write
one, adapting the concept of an <indig> Ynang Bayan </indig> in the <foreign>
zarzuela </foreign> <indig> <it> Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas </it> </indig> into
an <indig> Inang Kalikasan </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#12:1>
Regis did not give literary contests a thought when she wrote her
plays.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#13:1>
But a former student who had won a national award for poetry read
&ldquo; <indig> Karagatan </indig> &rdquo; and convinced her to send in her
work.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#14:1>
She submitted &ldquo; <indig> Dalawang Mukha </indig> , &rdquo; which
was more polished because it had been presented several times.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#15:1>
It also has a less provocative ending than &ldquo; <indig> Karagatan
</indig> , &rdquo; which ends with a mass action.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#16:1>
A few months later, Regis was planning Environmental Week activities
when a telegram arrived, informing her that she had won one of the two first
prizes for the Palanca for one-act play in Filipino.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#17:1>
Since then, she has written two more environmental and one historical
play. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#18:1>
But why a critique on an almost unknown writer &ldquo; out in the
sticks"? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#19:1>
First, literary critic Soledad C. Reyes states that <quote> the
hitherto neglected regional literature will have to be considered more
seriously before the label <it> <mention> Philippine Literature </mention>
</it> can assume a more valid meaning as a concept that encompasses not only
literature in Tagalog-speaking regions and/or Philippine Literature in
English, but the works produced outside the cities. </quote> ( Reyes 1987:72)
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#20:1>
Second, Patajo-Legasto ( 1993) calls for &ldquo;
reterritorialization &rdquo; of Philippine literary studies <quote> &ldquo;
to capture spaces for marginalized literatures &rdquo; </quote> ( 51). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#21:1>
This reading of Regis 's plays is a response to Reyes 's
criticism and Patajo-Legasto 's call for the study of marginalized
literatures toward a more encompassing body of literary criticism.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#22:1>
The plays are written by a member of the marginalized sex ( female)
in the periphery ( the countryside) of a marginalized country ( the
Philippines); they also center around a much maligned section ( the <indig>
kaingeros </indig> and fisherfolk) of an already marginalized sector of
society ( the rural poor).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#23:1>
Further, these plays are excellent literary works, as attested to by
a Palanca, but they most likely will not make it to the Philippine literary
canon.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#24:1>
They are therefore appropriate for a post-colonial critique in the
decolonizing Philippine society. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#25:1>
<h> <bold> <indig> DALAWANG DULA SA ECOLOHIYA </indig> </bold> </h>

<p> &ldquo; <indig> Karagatan </indig> &rdquo; is about a big problem in San
Miguel Bay, Camarines Sur.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#26:1>
Elpidio owns big trawls which use dynamite and <foreign> muro-ami
</foreign> to literally rake the fish from the sea.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#27:1>
He sells these at superprofits to Mr. Yen.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#28:1>
The small fishing community, among them the family of Karding and
Desta, are therefore left with hardly any fish.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#29:1>
Karding 's son Juanito, a college student, reports Elpidio to the
government.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#30:1>
Meanwhile, when the fishermen brave the deeper waters at night in
search of fish, Karding is killed in a storm.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#31:1>
The worst is not over, for Elpidio 's goons kill Juanito 's brother
when they learn about Juanito 's action.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#32:1>
The fisherfolk revolt against the trawler 's men, and their action
moves all the fishing communities in the land to protest their plight.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#33:1>
This in turn pushes the government to pass a law to protect the small
fisherfolk. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#34:1>
&ldquo; <indig> Dalawang Mukha ng Kagubatan </indig> &rdquo; has
a similar plot, except that the setting is the forest, and the conflict is
unresolved.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#35:1>
Berto and Julian are conscripted by Engineer Ramos to cut logs, which
Ramos in turn sells to Mr. Yen.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#36:1>
Julian dies when the branches of a tree they are cutting falls on
him.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#37:1>
The insensitive Engineer demands more wood, while Berto 's son Jun,
who is graduating from college, warns his father about the ecological
disasters logging brings.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#38:1>
His Lolo Doro, a farmer, takes his part, but Berto and Ana see no
other way to earn a living.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#39:1>
At the end of the play, Jun is killed when a tree falls on him during
a strong typhoon. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#40:1>
<h> <bold> LITERATURE FROM THE MARGINS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#41:1>
Patajo-Legasto defines post-colonial writings as <quote> those
that articulate the oppositional/interventionary as well as re-defined
consciousness of peoples whose identities have been fragmented, whose
cultures have been deracinated by the physical and epistemic violence of
imperialist incursions and colonialist systems of knowledge </quote> . (
Pantoja-Hidalgo and Patajo-Legasto 1993:6) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#42:1>
She further outlines the two characteristics of post-colonial
discourse.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#43:1>
First, it critiques Western hegemony, the assumptions of which have
penetrated into mass consciousness to legitimize colonialism and <quote>
&ldquo; to marginalize the cultural productions/knowledges of colonials and
former colonials &rdquo; </quote> ( 7).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#44:1>
Second, it articulates &ldquo; alternative practices &rdquo; which
include the forgotten or &ldquo; minority &rdquo; texts as well as currently
produced texts which confront the effects of, among others, <quote> &ldquo;
the uneven development of interlocking economic, political and cultural,
including aesthetic, modes of production &rdquo; </quote> ( 7). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#45:1>
Mabilangan also refers to post-colonial literature when she
states that &ldquo; emergent literature &rdquo; has been dismissed because of
their didacticism which according to the dominant canon <quote> &ldquo;
detracts from the 'beauty' of the written text &rdquo; </quote> (
Pantoja-Hidalgo and Patajo-Legasto, 1993:66).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#46:1>
For example, formalists may find that the plays of Regis lack &ldquo;
textual virtuosity &rdquo; because of their &ldquo; simple &rdquo; characters
and plots.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#47:1>
But as Mabilangan further states, <quote> Emergent literature demands
a new set of rules for it has broken the old set.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#48:1>
Therefore, for us to understand emergent literature, we need to learn
how to read again. </quote> ( 66) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#49:1>
I will read Regis 's texts by experimenting with such <quote>
&ldquo; a new set of rules," </quote> one that deals with environmentalism as
discourse and as literature. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#50:1>
<h> <bold> ENVIRONMENTALISM AS TWO-FACED DISCOURSE </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#51:1>
In an article entitled <mention> &ldquo; In the service of two
gods: deconstructing environmentalism as a two-faced discourse, &rdquo;
</mention> Contreras ( 1992) states: <quote> &ldquo; Discourse on
environmental protection is a political terrain that has to be fought not
only in terms of people against the forces of ecological destruction, but
also in terms of battles between classes, genders, and races of people.
&rdquo; </quote> ( 13) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#52:1>
Contreras further claims that environmentalism can be and has
been used as an instrument by those in power for its own ends - - whether it
be its development agenda, or an imperialist, white racist, male-dominated
colonizing world.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#53:1>
At the same time, he points out that environmentalism can be used by
the oppressed classes to challenge the dominant ideology.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#54:1>
Thus, the two faces of environmentalism - - <quote> &ldquo; the
hegemony maintaining face, and the counter-hegemony building face &rdquo;
</quote> ( 15).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#55:1>
To become a radical counterdiscourse, Contreras says that
environmentalists should <quote> challenge the current social arrangements -
- the modes of production, consumption and constitution which provide cause
and reason for ecological disasters... by providing an avenue for the
oppressed to constitute their own languages and practices which could later
pave a way for their withdrawal from the consensual relations of domination
in which they have been invested. </quote> ( 15) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#56:1>
Further, Contreras says that environmentalism should be imbued
with a counterideology and struggle against the structures of oppression.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#57:1>
He points out the new counterideology as deep ecology, socialist
ecology, indigenous ecology, and eco-feminism, all of which indict present
structures. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#58:1>
While Contreras 's theory is not exactly on literature, his
constant references to <mention> &ldquo; discourse, &rdquo; </mention>
defined as <quote> &ldquo; ways in which meanings are constructed, &rdquo;
</quote> ( Pantoja-Hidalgo and Patajo-Legasto 1993:42) tie up the
environmentalist concerns of Regis 's plays with issues tackled in recent
literary theorizing.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#59:1>
Literature is one form of discourse wed in the text of Regis.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#60:1>
Contreras 's references to class, gender, and race, and to &ldquo;
deconstruction &rdquo; also show the common concerns of environmental and
literary discourse in a post-colonial context. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#61:1>
<h> <bold> REGIS 's ENVIRONMENTALISM </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#62:1>
The texts contend with the forces which bring ecological
destruction - - the greed of Ramos, Elpidio ( spelled out in the surname
<mention> <indig> Maramot </indig> </mention> ) and Mr. Yen, the propensity
for materialism and conspicuous consumption, as well as the needs of the
forest and fisherfolk.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#63:1>
But in confronting the causes of environmental degradation, do the
plays take up cudgels regarding issues of &ldquo; gender, class and race
&rdquo; necessary for environmentalism 's &ldquo; counterhegemony building
face"? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#64:1>
To take the first of these issues, Regis 's texts evidently carry
no feminist sensibility.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#65:1>
Though there are women characters, they play supporting roles in both
plays; the human protagonists are young males, Juanito in &ldquo; <indig>
Karagatan </indig> &rdquo; and Jun in &ldquo; <indig> Dalawang Mukha </indig> .
&rdquo; It may be pointed out that in &ldquo; <indig> Dalawang Mukha
</indig , &rdquo; nature is troped as a w oman and death as a man, but these
are traditional conventions rather than any conscious uplifting of the status
of woman.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#66:1>
Ana, the only female human in this play, is not a very likeable
character as compared with the wise grandfather or her idealistic son.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#67:1>
She is painted as the conspicuous consumer who pushes her husband to
cut more trees so that they can have a feast for Jun 's graduation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#68:1>
When her son reminds her, <X> <quote> <it> <indig> Pero huwag na sana
kayong mag-abala pang maghanda.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#X69:1>
Mahirap lang naman tayo </indig> </it> , </quote> </X> Ana
confidently says, <X> <quote> <it> <indig> Kaya ka naming ipaghanda.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#X70:1>
Maraming kahoy sa bundok </indig> , </it> </quote> </X> ( Regis
1993:57) revealing the stereotype of the &ldquo; <indig> <mention> Bilmoko
</mention> </indig> &rdquo; woman who thinks only of short-term luxuries.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#71:1>
In &ldquo; <indig> Karagatan </indig> , &rdquo; Desta is the
<foreign> <it> mater dolorosa </it> </foreign> who serves her menfolk and
grieves over the corpses of husband and son.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#72:1>
When other female characters speak, it is in the form of traditional
&ldquo; woman 's talk, &rdquo; a form of non-speech and background static of
background noises and gossip which do nothing to articulate women 's
concerns.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#73:1>
In fact, the neighboring women in &ldquo; <indig> Karagatan </indig>
&rdquo; are gossips who, while providing background information on Elpidio,
are judgmental of other women: <O> quotation in Tagalog </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#74:1>
Patriarchal conjugal relations are not questioned either in both
plays; the husband goes off to work and the mother stays home to keep house,
hiding the reality that women participate in productive activities in these
rural households.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#75:1>
Finally, the priority given to the son instead of the daughter in
terms of education is not questioned, only the poverty that prevents the
daughter from going to school. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#76:1>
This concern with poverty leads to the second issue of class
struggle, and Regis 's position on this is clearer.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#77:1>
Neither Berto 's nor Karding 's family has ever had access to
development or even social equity, which is why Mida, Andoy, and Berto
harvest the sea of its coral and the forest of its trees.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#78:1>
The text questions the present social arrangements, as in Ana 's
explanation to Jun about why they cut trees for a living: <O> quotation in
Tagalog </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#79:1>
The land problem, one of the root causes of poverty in the
Philippines, is revealed as also being one cause of environmental degradation
in this country.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#80:1>
Few <foreign> hacenderos </foreign> own hundreds of hectares of land
and many are squatters in their own country, forcing some of them to be
<indig> <it> kaingineros </it> </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#81:1>
A kind of class consciousness may be seen too in the comments of
<indig> Lolo </indig> Doro about the insensitivity of Engineer Ramos, <O>
quotation in Tagalog </O> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#82:1>
This not-too-veiled criticism of bureaucrats ( is her use of the
Top Bureaucrat 's name coincidental?) and bureaucrat capitalism is more
straightforward in &ldquo; <indig> Karagatan </indig> &rdquo; when Karding
comments <X> <quote> <it> <indig> Parang walang magawa ang mga pulis at
namamahalang kawanihan dito </indig> </it> </quote> </X> ( 6) and Kikoy says:
<O> quotation in Tagalog </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#83:1>
Class consciousness is also evident when Karding reflects, <X>
<quote> <it> <indig> Kung minsan naiisip ko tuloy, ang mundo ba ay para sa
mga mayayaman lamang </indig> </it> ? </quote> </X> ( 6) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#84:1>
As to questions of race and colonization, Regis chooses to
critique the new imperialists and the &ldquo; new collaborators, &rdquo;
rather than the overstaying American neo-colonialists or their &ldquo; little
brown American &rdquo; cohorts.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#85:1>
Japan is satirized in Mr. Yen, while the modern-day <indig> Makapilis
</indig> are exposed through Doro 's mockery of Engineer Ramos 's greed and
insensitivity, and through Juanito 's accusation of Elpidio: <O> quotation in
Tagalog </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-002#86:1>
To summarize, Regis attacks the unequal social arrangements, the
political economy which fosters these, and neo-colonialism of the Japanese
kind, but does not question the traditional roles of women in a feudal and
patriarchal society. </p> </I>
