<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#3:1>
For all intents and purposes the Office Suite wars are over.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#4:1>
Microsoft has won with an overwhelming 80 to 90% market shares.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#5:1>
Novell is now shopping around for someone to buy its WordPerfect
Office business unit.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#6:1>
And Lotus, now owned by IBM, is looking for market niches for the
Lotus Office suite.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#7:1>
Microsoft Office consists of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Schedule.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#8:1>
Microsoft Office Pro consist of the above plus Access. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#9:1>
Just a few years ago WordPerfect was the number one word processor
and Lotus 1-2-3 was the number one electronic spread sheet.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#10:1>
Harvard Graphics was the leading presentation software, Lotus
Organizer was the leading personal information manager. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#11:1>
Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint were good products but they
were not the market leaders.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#12:1>
If Microsoft has gone one on one against the leaders in each
productivity tool category it would have been a long bloody war with no
assurance of victory much less dominance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#13:1>
Microsoft 's strategists saw that its major strength was in
having a combination of products to meet office productivity needs.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#14:1>
The competitors had excellent individual products but did not have a
full set of tools to meet office productivity needs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#15:1>
Microsoft saw the opportunity and launched the Microsoft Office
suite at a price that no one else could afford.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#16:1>
Microsoft Office did not cost two or three times the price of an
individual tool.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#17:1>
It cost only slightly more than any one tool ( Word, Excel, or
PowerPoint).

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#18:1>
Thus buyers opted for Microsoft Office over combinations of its
competitor tools.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#19:1>
Furthermore, when WordPerfect and Lotus responded with their own
office suites they came in multicolored boxes.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#20:1>
A situation which would make it very hard to give the impression of
seamless integration between the tool categories. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#21:1>
Microsoft has made seamless integration its major competitive
weapon.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#22:1>
It always fascinates me to watch a Microsoft demo of Project.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#23:1>
The emphasis of the demo is not the scheduling of activities on the
Gantt or PERT charts.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#24:1>
The emphasis is on how the project manager can quickly prepare a
progress letter to the project owners and seamlessly embed a summary project
schedule chart using OLE ( object linking and embedding) or how the project
cost data can be transferred to an Excel spread sheet to do a budget analysis
and show the varieties using Excel 's charting capabilities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#25:1>
Now that Microsoft has established dominance in office
productivity tools, it is now ready to take on the MIS market which has long
been the turf of system vendors and database and application development tool
vendors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#26:1>
Microsoft has a two-pronged strategy to conquer this market.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#27:1>
To attack the database segment Microsoft has the Back Office.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#28:1>
The Back Office consists of six servers - - Windows NT Server, SQL
Server, SNA Server, Mail Server, and coming soon, Exchange Server. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#29:1>
Windows NT Server is Microsoft 's multipurpose network operating
system.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#30:1>
It provides a combination of file print, client/server database and
communications services.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#31:1>
It combines the functionality of Novell NetWare and UNIX in a single
system.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#32:1>
Windows NT can coexist with existing NetWare and/or UNIX system.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#33:1>
It is rapidly eroding Novell 's NetWare installed base and the UNIX
vendor 's market base. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#34:1>
Digital Equipment seems to be back.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#35:1>
It had a very strong presence at COMDEX.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#36:1>
Almost all their systems were running Windows 95 or Windows NT.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#37:1>
I kidded the Digital sales people at the booth about what happened to
VX/VMS, Ultrix, and Open VMS.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#38:1>
They pointed out that somewhere in the many booths they had an Alpha
running VMS.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#39:1>
It is quite clear that the Digital comeback is anchored on the fact
that the Alpha is the most powerful processor running on NT. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#40:1>
SQL Server is Microsoft 's scalable high-performance relational
database management system designed for distributed client/server computing.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#41:1>
SQL Server was originally identical to Sybase SQL Server.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#42:1>
A few years back Microsoft and Sybase agreed to part ways and
differentiate their products because Sybase could not follow Microsoft
high-volume, low-cost market strategy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#43:1>
SQL Server Version 6.0 is definitely an in-house Microsoft
enhancement.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#44:1>
Among its key enhancements are: built in data replication; parallel
processing enhancements; GUI distributed management tools; and superior
integration with Windows NT and other back office products. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#45:1>
A number of market analysts expect Microsoft SQL Server to
overtake Oracle by 1998. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#46:1>
SNA Server provides connectivity to IBM AS/400 and mainframe
systems.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#47:1>
System Management Server supports e-mail and Microsoft Exchange
Support workgroup computing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#48:1>
The other segment which Microsoft is now attacking is application
development.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#49:1>
Microsoft 's key business palliation development products are Access
and Visual BASIC. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#50:1>
Access and FoxPro are Microsoft 's leading desktop database
products.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#51:1>
FoxPro was the industry leading DBMS.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#52:1>
Access is Microsoft 's product for the future.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#53:1>
While FoxPro had market share, Access had a newer relational DBMS
architecture.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#54:1>
Microsoft built up ACCESS market share by making it a part of
Microsoft Office Pro. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#55:1>
<mention> Access </mention> is actually a multi - purpose
product.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#56:1>
It is now the best PC and LAN database management system because it
combines ease of use and relational DBMS functionality.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#57:1>
It was <it> PC Magazine </it> 's Editor 's Choice in the last review
of PC DBMS, a position formerly occupied by MicroRim 's R:Base.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#58:1>
It is also an excellent query and reporting tool for accessing data
stored in its own files or in other database.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#59:1>
And now an excellent application development tool for client/server
solutions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#60:1>
The Access Developer 's Toolkit presents a serious threat to
Power Builder.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#61:1>
Among its key features are: OLE Controls; Replication Manager; Office
Compatibility kit; Visual BASIC for Applications; Forms Design; Performance
and Table Analyzer Wizards; and Enhanced Jet Engine. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#62:1>
Visual BASIC has grown from being a GUI version of Quick Base.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#63:1>
Visual BASIC is now the common programming language for three key
Microsoft products--Excel, Project and ACCESS.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#64:1>
Visual Basic for applications is bundled with each of these products.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#65:1>
Visual Basic is an object-based programming language.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#66:1>
Although OOP purists will not accept it as a full object-oriented
language, it boasts the world 's largest and fastest growing library of
rebuilt VBX and OLE components. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#67:1>
<mention> Visual Basic </mention> comes in three versions:
Standard Edition, Professional Edition and Enterprise Edition.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#68:1>
All three versions provide an easy to learn and use visual
environment-based programming language and data access capabilities including
an integrated database engine. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#69:1>
<mention> Standard Edition </mention> is designed for power users
who want to quickly build Windows 95 applications.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#70:1>
<mention> Professional Edition </mention> is designed for developers
to build 16-bit and 32-bit applications and to build libraries of OLE
components. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#71:1>
<mention> Enterprise Edition </mention> is designed for teams
building large client/server applications.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#72:1>
It supports the creation of three-tier applications.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#73:1>
It includes <mention> Source Safe </mention> , which manages source
code and enables multiple programmers to work together.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#74:1>
Full ODBC support enables Visual BASIC applications to run with
ACCESS SQL Server and Oracle Databases. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#75:1>
The Microsoft steam roller is gathering momentum.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#76:1>
I don't think that the Network Centric vision will stop it. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> New techno uses blood analysis as diet tool </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#78:2>
<bold> Susan A. de Guzman </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#79:2>
BLOOD is blood--that red liquid flowing in your veins.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#80:2>
But scrutinized under a microscope and magnified on screen, it 's a
much more interesting sight.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#81:2>
This up-close and personal view of so-called &ldquo; live blood
&rdquo; shows organisms of varying shapes and sizes moving ceaselessly about.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#82:2>
To the untrained eye, this image may be nothing more than a
jumble of odd shapes and figures.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#83:2>
But to the health expert, this specimen is a valuable tool in
assessing a person 's physical condition. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#84:2>
A nutritional supplements company is now using this technology
from the US--called <mention> live blood microscopy </mention> - - to analyze
a patient 's nutritional deficiencies or excesses.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#85:2>
This way, the nutritive problem can be easily identified and
addressed with the help of enzyme-based supplements. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#86:2>
Unlike an ordinary blood analysis which is quantitative, blood
microscopy is qualitative.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#87:2>
The former keeps track of the number of the person 's white blood
cells, red blood cells and platelets.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#88:2>
The latter indicates what condition those blood components are in.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#89:2>
The live blood demonstration, however, is for nutritional information
only and is not to be considered medical diagnosis. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#90:2>
<h> <bold> Simple procedure </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#91:2>
The procedure itself is simple.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#92:2>
Blood is obtained from the person through a finger prick.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#93:2>
This sample is placed on a slide.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#94:2>
When examined under the microscope, the magnified version of the
blood is projected on a TV screen. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#95:2>
<quote> &ldquo; There is a big impact when people see for
themselves how their own blood looks like.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#96:2>
When they see all these moving forms, they become curious and ask
questions about it.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#97:2>
Through microscopy, we can explain better what 's going on inside
their body on a cellular level, &rdquo; </quote> said Richard Glenn Ortega of
Bio-Enzyme Inc., which distributes the Infinity2 brand of nutritional
supplements. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#98:2>
<mention> Bio-Enzyme </mention> has a chart indicating the normal
appearance of various cells and cell groupings.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#99:2>
Any aberrations are said to be symptoms of a particular affliction.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#100:2>
To drive home their point, they ask the patient to take enzyme
tablets upon consultation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#101:2>
After a few minutes, a blood sample is taken again.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#102:2>
What was shown before as a build-up of undigested food, for example,
gradually disappears reportedly as a direct result of enzyme intake. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#103:2>
<h> <bold> Enzyme supplement </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#104:2>
In another demonstration, Ortega breaks a capsule of enzyme
supplement into a cup of chocolate pudding.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#105:2>
He stirs it in, and in a matter of minutes, the jelly-like substance
transforms into almost liquid form--an indication that the enzyme helps
quicken food digestion. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#106:2>
<quote> &ldquo; We have a natural supply of enzymes in the body.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#107:2>
There are metabolic enzymes the body needs to run itself.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#108:2>
Then there 's a limited supply of digestive enzymes which is put in
your 'enzyme bank account' at birth, &rdquo; </quote> says Victor Chua, also
of Bio-Enzyme Inc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#109:2>
Enzymes needed for proper digestion and absorption ideally comes
from food.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#110:2>
Unfortunately, research has proven that cooking, processing,
irradiating, microwaving and other preservation techniques kill almost all of
the natural enzymes in food.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#111:2>
Also, it has been found that many raw foods today are
enzyme-deficient, owing to the use of pesticides and other chemicals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#112:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Your body has to 'rob' enzymes from your
personal enzyme bank account and even use some of your metabolic enzymes, to
attempt the digestive process.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#113:2>
This reduces the amount of these enzymes available for body
functions, &rdquo; </quote> Chua says. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#114:2>
Ortega also notes the existence of &ldquo; free radicals &rdquo;
in the body that, while essential particularly to the immune system, must be
controlled by antioxidants.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#115:2>
The free radicals cause rapid oxidation of tissues and fats,
resulting in tissue damage and premature aging if not controlled. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#116:2>
<h> <bold> Dietary habits </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#117:2>
<quote> &ldquo; It is very important that antioxidants be
complete so that when they do their job opposing free radicals, the process
does not result in the creation of more free radicals.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#118:2>
Now, there 's a coordinated approach of using both vitamin and
enzyme antioxidants together to prevent further free radical damage, &rdquo;
</quote> says Ortega. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#119:2>
Aside from live blood microscopy, <mention> Bio-Enzyme
</mention> asks the patient to fill up a questionnaire to assess his health
based on dietary habits, exercise routines and previous ailments.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#120:2>
<quote> &ldquo; This health evaluation profile will help give a
total picture of the patient 's lifestyle.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#121:2>
Based on this, we can recommend a specific program suited to his
condition, &rdquo; </quote> says Ortega. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#122:2>
The questionnaire is very detailed.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#123:2>
For starters, the person is asked what food he ate the day before
and what his normal diet consists of.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#124:2>
There are over a hundred questions the person may answer <mention>
no/never </mention> , <mention> yes/sometimes </mention> or <mention> often
</mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#125:2>
These queries include: Do you feel sleepy or have low energy after
eating?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#126:2>
Do you have varicose veins or bruise too easily?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#127:2>
Do you have trouble sleeping?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#128:2>
Do you have cravings for sweets or sugars?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#129:2>
Are you moody?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#130:2>
Have you undergone any surgery within the last 90 days?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#131:2>
Do you have ridges in your fingernails?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#132:2>
Do you eat red meats?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#133:2>
Do you smoke or are you exposed to second hand smoke or smog?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#134:2>
Do you have excessive wrinkling of the skin?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#135:2>
Do you experience bloating? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#136:2>
Ortega singles out that feeling sluggish after eating is already
an indication that something 's wrong inside.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#137:2>
<quote> &ldquo; When you eat food, you should be energized.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#138:2>
If the opposite happens, you have to find out why. &rdquo; </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#139:2>
Ortega says they usually advocate a combination of changes in a
person 's diet, the implementation of an exercise program and the intake of
nutritional supplements.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#140:2>
He enumerates, <quote> &ldquo; One of the main principles is to eat
a minimum of 50 percent raw food.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#141:2>
Ideally, there should be five servings of fruit a day and three
vegetable servings a day.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#142:2>
As much as possible, we also encourage them not to eat fried food to
avoid fat intake.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#143:2>
The alternatives are to bake, broil, steam or roast food. &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#144:2>
He adds, <quote> &ldquo; As much as possible, they should make
time for exercise.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#145:2>
The common excuse people give is that they have no time for it.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#146:2>
But we tell them, they don't have to go to the gym to exercise.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#147:2>
They can do it right at home, even while watching television.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#148:2>
Based also on their findings, they suggest a combination of
supplements for the patient to take according to his needs.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#149:2>
The Infinity2 range has five professional products and seven
nutritional products. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#150:2>
While the aforementioned comprise the general measures they
advise patients, Chua stresses evaluation is done on a case to case basis.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#151:2>
<quote> &ldquo; We go for 'customized' treatment because it 's
really dependent on the person 's condition, &rdquo; </quote> he explains.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#152:2>
<quote> &ldquo; For example, he may have a health restriction which
prevents him from eating the food we suggest or maybe from exercising.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#153:2>
Expectedly, lifelong practices cannot be changed overnight.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#154:2>
Dr. Annie Damian-Relucio, <mention> Bio-Enzyme </mention> 's
consulting physician, says, <quote> &ldquo; It takes 21 days to change a
habit.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#155:2>
This is why we have to monitor the patients closely and guide them
as they go through their specific programs.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#156:2>
When they strictly follow the program, they themselves notice the
difference in a matter of days. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#157:2>
Making the changes will reportedly improve the life span by some
20 to 30 years, plus quality.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#158:2>
Not only is the life span extended, says Ortega, but those
additional years will be lived still at optimum health. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#159:2>
Chua, however, insists that the health professional can only do
so much in improving a patient 's well-being. <mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#160:2>
<quote> &ldquo; On our part, we supply them with the information,
help them to understand it, and let them know their options.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#161:2>
In other words, we give them the tools.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#162:2>
We educate then and motivate them.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-037#163:2>
But we may have the best products, we may give them the best advice,
but if they don't act on it, <indig> wala rin </indig> .
