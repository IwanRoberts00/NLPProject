<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#X1:1>
HOW COME NOT EVERYONE EXISTS IN THE EXISTENTIAL SENSE? </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#2:1>
First, what is the definition of the existentialist of the word
<mention> &ldquo; exist. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#3:1>
To &ldquo; exist &rdquo; means not just being there.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#4:1>
Not just being part of the crowd.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#5:1>
To &ldquo; exist &rdquo; means not being a coward.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#6:1>
Not to hide in anonymity.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#7:1>
To &ldquo; exist &rdquo; means to stand out.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#8:1>
Be unique. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#9:1>
Material things do not exist in the existential sense because it
is <quote> &ldquo; in itself &rdquo; </quote> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#10:1>
Mankind exist because it is <quote> &ldquo; for itself &rdquo;
</quote> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#11:1>
A person exists but not in the existential point of view if for
example that person doesn't stand up for what he believes in.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#12:1>
For example, there 's a group of friends and in this group there 's a
very vocal one.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#13:1>
What he says is always followed.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#14:1>
If he says we 'll eat at McDonald 's today, everyone will follow.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#15:1>
What if one of you disagrees with your friend.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#16:1>
He would rather eat at Jollibee than McDonald 's.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#17:1>
The only problem is, he 's afraid to speak-up.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#18:1>
He can't say that he wants to eat at Jollibee.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#19:1>
All he does is complain but he never did anything to solve his
problem.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#20:1>
In the existential sense, he doesn't &ldquo; exist".

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#21:1>
Existentialist believe that he should stand up for what he believes.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#22:1>
He is free to choose where he wants to eat and must be responsible
for the choice he made.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#23:1>
If he were to stand up and say that he wants to eat at Jollibee and
if the consequence of this choice is that he will eat alone in Jollibee, then
he must be responsible for the action he made. </p> <X>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#X24:1>
WHY IS THE DECISION TO BE AUTHENTIC NOT A ONE-SHOT DEAL? </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#25:1>
Sometimes, you can be an existentialist and an essentialist.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#26:1>
I mean, some of us are existentialist in a particular case and be an
essentialist in another case.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#27:1>
For example, in courting, we are existentialist because we are free
to choose whoever we want to court but if the girl we are courting didn't say
<quote> &ldquo; I LOVE YOU &rdquo; </quote> also <indig> binasted </indig> ,
we sometimes say: <quote> &ldquo; it 's okey, someone is out there waiting
for me, my destiny &rdquo; </quote> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#28:1>
It 's ironic because we know that the perfect girl won't just appear
but we must look for her.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#29:1>
Court other girls so that we can find that perfect girl for us.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#30:1>
Not just pray to God that the perfect girl would just appear from out
of nowhere.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#31:1>
We are responsible for our actions and yet we still believe that we
are destined with someone out there.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#32:1>
Why should a man even bother to court a woman if he knows that there
is a woman destined for her. </p> <X>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#X33:1>
HOW COME <mention> &ldquo; HUMAN NATURE/FRAILITY &rdquo; </mention>
, <foreign> ETC. </foreign> IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE EXCUSE? </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#34:1>
Man has no innate nature.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#35:1>
Man creates himself.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#36:1>
Therefore, it follows that man creates his own human nature and human
fraility.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#37:1>
We are free individuals and this freedom condemns us to make choices
all throughout our lives.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#38:1>
There are no eternal values we can adhere to which make our choices
even more significant.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#39:1>
We are totally capable of everything we do.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#40:1>
Man must never disclaim the responsibility that comes with the
choices he makes.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#41:1>
Man must never blame human nature or human frailities because we are
responsible with the choices we make.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#42:1>
For example, in a boy-girl relationship.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#43:1>
When the two broke-up.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#44:1>
A friend asked the boy why they broke-up.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#45:1>
The boy said: <quote> &ldquo; We just can't stand each other anymore
&rdquo; </quote> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#46:1>
The friend asked: <quote> &ldquo; why? &rdquo; </quote> The boy
answered: <quote> &ldquo; we just see our mistakes rather than the positive
things &rdquo; </quote> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#47:1>
The friend again asked: <quote> &ldquo; Why? &rdquo; </quote> the boy
replied: <quote> &ldquo; well, we 're only human, born to make mistakes!
&rdquo; </quote> Existentialist doesn't accept that kind of excuse.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#48:1>
Human fraility is not an escape route where we can pass the blame
onto.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#49:1>
The couple broke up because it was their choice.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#50:1>
They had problems because they choose not to find a solution but
rather blame other things, think of other reasons why they broke up. </p> <X>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#X51:1>
HOW DOES EXISTENTIALISM AFFECT MORAL DECISIONS? </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#52:1>
I think existentialism looks at the circumstances surrounding the
issue before they decide what their decision should be.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#53:1>
For example, suicide.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#54:1>
Everyone knows that suicide is wrong and sinful.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#55:1>
It is not accepted in our society because tradition tells us that
suicide is wrong.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#56:1>
An existentialist would look at the circumstance which lead to doing
the act.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#57:1>
If you take into consideration the movie <mention> Devil 's Advocate
</mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#58:1>
Keanu Reeves committed suicide in the end because Al Pacino wanted
him to have sex with this woman and if they consumate, the birth of the devil
would take into place.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#59:1>
The woman needed Keanu 's semen for he is a half-child of Satan
himself.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#60:1>
What would you do if you were in his case?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#61:1>
You have two choices, either you have sex and don't.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#62:1>
But having sex with the woman is not an option.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#63:1>
So, Keanu killed himself so that Satan 's plan of ruling the earth
will not take place. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#64:1>
Everyone makes a choice that he believes would be for his own
good.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#65:1>
Thus, when a person makes a choice he believes that it is good for
mankind.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#66:1>
For example, I choose to lie because I believe it is for my own good.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#67:1>
Therefore, I must also take into consideration that if someone lies
to me, it is okey because lying is good for mankind.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#68:1>
But not all the cases of lying is good.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#69:1>
It is not meant to be in general.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#70:1>
We must first look at the circumstances why lying occurred. </p> <X>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#X71:1>
WHAT TO EXISTENTIALISM IS THE PROBLEM WITH A) DESTINY, B) GOD? </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#72:1>
A) The problem with destiny is that we can't control our lives.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#73:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Essence before existence &rdquo; </quote> which goes
against existentialism which is <quote> &ldquo; Existence before essence
&rdquo; </quote> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#74:1>
Existentialism believes that there is no ready-made essence or
mission or purpose in life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#75:1>
We make or create our own life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#76:1>
Destiny rebukes against that having destiny is having your life
created for you.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#77:1>
That someone already planned your life and that you can never &ldquo;
re-write &rdquo; your life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#78:1>
For example, the story of <mention> Oedipus Rex </mention> , his
destiny was to kill his father and marry his mother.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#79:1>
When the parents knew about this, they ordered to kill Oedipus.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#80:1>
Imagine, killing your own child.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#81:1>
But he wasn't killed instead, he was found by another King & Queen.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#82:1>
To cut the story short, he did kill his father and married his mother
which was his destiny.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#83:1>
Even if the father tried to &ldquo; re-write &rdquo; Oedipus ' life,
he still couldn't and neither could Oedipus because of destiny.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#84:1>
We can't control our live in destiny.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#85:1>
We 're just stage actors trying to follow a script that was already
ready-made for us.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#86:1>
We have no hold over our lives.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#87:1>
We 're just dummies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#88:1>
B) The writer of our script would be God.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#89:1>
Existentialism tells us that God already planned our life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#90:1>
We are free and if we are free, we are free to choose.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#91:1>
How can we be free if our own existence wasn't our own choice?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#92:1>
Did anyone ask us if we wanted to live in this world?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#93:1>
No one.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#94:1>
And yet we are free individuals.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#95:1>
We are condemned to choose, condemned to decide and condemned to be
free! </p> </I>


<I>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#96:2>
1. In existentialism, to exist means to stand up, to be unique
and to be individuals.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#97:2>
But many of us choose to be just another face in the crowd, we choose
to be anonymous, faceless egos.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#98:2>
These people who lose themselves to conformity and who do not stand
up for what they believe in do not exist, according to existentialism.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#99:2>
To exist in the existential sense, we must know what we want to
become and to be that kind of person.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#100:2>
To exist means we must search for our purpose in life and to fulfill
it.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#101:2>
If we decide to just <quote> &ldquo; go with the flow &rdquo;
</quote> and to be just <quote> &ldquo; one of the gang &rdquo; </quote> then
we cease to exist.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#102:2>
In existentialism, to exist does not just mean to be physically
alive, it is to live your life the way you want it, to be your true self.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#103:2>
If you sacrifice your identity to conformity, then you don't exist
which many of us do today. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#104:2>
2. The decision to be authentic is not a &ldquo; one-shot
&rdquo; deal.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#105:2>
We cannot say, <quote> &ldquo; I 've been authentic today, that
means that until I die, I can call myself to be a true authentic &rdquo;
</quote> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#106:2>
Being authentic is a decision that has to be made everyday until we
die.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#107:2>
It has to be renewed each day.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#108:2>
It doesn't mean that if you 've been authentic today then you will
be authentic tomorrow.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#109:2>
It depends on us to decide to be authentic each day.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#110:2>
It is our choice to be authentic or not each day that we wake up.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#111:2>
We face many different situations in which we are called to be
authentic.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#112:2>
In each of these situations, we decide on whether we will become
authentic or not.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#113:2>
We will be judged to be authentic or not by the sum of the events
that have happened in our life, not just by one event. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#114:2>
3. Human nature/fraility is not an acceptable excuse in
existentialism because in existentialism, existence preceded essence.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#115:2>
We are all created equal and it is up to us to find our own purpose
in life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#116:2>
Human nature/frailty is not an excuse because we have the power to
decide to be authentic, to be our true selves.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#117:2>
If we become weak, we have the power in us to be determined to be
authentic and to be strong. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#118:2>
Existence precedes essence.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#119:2>
This means that we have no pre-determined destiny.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#120:2>
We have to make our own lives.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#121:2>
In existentialism, we were all created equal.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#122:2>
Human nature and fraility does not apply. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#123:2>
Existentialism does not believe in God.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#124:2>
To believe in God is to believe that God created the first man as
Adam and the first woman was Eve; when they ate the forbidden fruit, then
they doomed to live life in earth.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#125:2>
It was through Adam and Eve that man inherited his &ldquo; original
sin".

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#126:2>
When you believe in God then, you believe that men carry with them
the &ldquo; original sin &rdquo; that is why they experience frailty.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#127:2>
It is the human nature to be sinful because of this original sin .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#128:2>
Existentialist do not believe in all these.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#129:2>
We have nothing to blame but ourselves because it is our own
decision. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#130:2>
4. To be an existentialist is to be free but to be free and at
the same time being responsible.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#131:2>
We are responsible for the consequences of our decisions.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#132:2>
To be free also means to be responsible for the people who are
affected by our decisions.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#133:2>
In addressing the issue of abortion, we would also consider the life
of the fetus in our womb because our decision to abort or not to abort will
definitely affect the baby in our womb.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#134:2>
We would think, <quote> &ldquo; yes, this is my baby and I can do
whatever I want to do with it , but the baby inside me is another life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#135:2>
My decision will affect this baby 's life". </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#136:2>
We become more responsible in our decision and we are considerate of
the lives of other people who are affected by our decision. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#137:2>
5.a.) In existentialism, there is no destiny, these is no
pre-determined life for us.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#138:2>
We are created first and it is up to us to find our own purpose in
life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#139:2>
<quote> &ldquo; We make our destiny" </quote> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#140:2>
We are the ones who plan our life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#141:2>
Destiny means that each one of us has a pre-defined purpose in life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#142:2>
It means that our life is already planned w/c is not so in
existentialism.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#143:2>
We make our life, we are the ones who plans our life and decide what
will happen with it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#144:2>
b.) There is no GOD in existentialism.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#145:2>
People who believe in GOD also believe in the devil.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#146:2>
We often blame him / pass the blame to him whenever that person
commits a mistake.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#147:2>
We often say, <quote> &ldquo; The devil tempted me &rdquo; </quote>
whenever we succumb.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#148:2>
To believe in God means to believe that there is heaven and there is
hell.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#149:2>
You will go to one of these places often you die.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#150:2>
But in existentialism, there is no heaven or hell.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#151:2>
It is not concerned with the after-life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#152:2>
It is concerned with our life now, at the moment, at the present.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#153:2>
To believe in God means that when you die and had been good during
your life on earth, then you will enter God 's kingdom and have eternal life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#154:2>
Existentialism does not touch on the After-life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-014#155:2>
It has no God. </p> </I>
