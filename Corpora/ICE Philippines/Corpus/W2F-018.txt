<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#3:1>
Standing there, actually in front of the shop, Romina felt the
indecision move from the pit of her belly to the tips of her fingers.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#4:1>
<mention> &ldquo; Johnny 's Skin Art, &rdquo; </mention> said the
wooden signboard swinging from chains beside the door.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#5:1>
The wooden door was painted with intricate designs which some might
consider art, but which Romina thought looked graffiti-like, even menacing: a
smiling skull with a top hat, a pistol and a rose crossed below it -- the logo
of a popular band called <mention> &ldquo; Guns and Roses &rdquo; </mention>
; a fire-breathing dragon spreading its wings over the top of the door
breathing red and orange flames; and below the skull, at the bottom part of
the door, a chaos of flowers mixed with evil-looking elves and a raging
tiger.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#6:1>
This was it, the place Miguel said he got his tattoo from. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#7:1>
Romina 's indecision was slowly turning into fear and she had to
gather up all her will to push open the door.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#8:1>
She was going through with this.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#9:1>
No matter what. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#10:1>
A tingling of bells from a door chime announced her entry.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#11:1>
The man looked up from the wrestling match blaring from the TV set
above the counter.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#12:1>
He had his feet up, and his dirty black boots, almost brown with
dust, stuck out from his even filthier jeans as he leaned way back in his
chair.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#13:1>
It seemed as if only his feet anchored his body to the table, keeping
him from falling to the floor.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#14:1>
The creaky old fan in the corner did little to cool the mid-afternoon
heat.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#15:1>
There were no windows looking out into the hot crowded street with
its careening jeepneys and swelling rush of people.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#16:1>
It was just as well.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#17:1>
There wasn't enough breeze to blow away the warmth made worse by the
television set, and the heat which emanated from the man 's body. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#18:1>
Romina didn't like it that the man didn't have a shirt on.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#19:1>
It seemed indecent.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#20:1>
The tattoos covering his back, his arms, and his chest, weren't
enough to conceal his nakedness.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#21:1>
And still, even without a shirt on, the small closed-in room was
making the man sweat. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#22:1>
The sweat made his body glisten, giving the figures on his skin
the effect of being alive.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#23:1>
When he turned to look at the TV, Romina noticed a huge bird on his
back -- a phoenix, she imagined, ready to rise.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#24:1>
A lotus flower resting on a pond on his shoulder seemed as if it had
just burst into bloom.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#25:1>
And on his right, a tiger, springing from his left breast, wrestled
ferociously with an angry dragon.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#26:1>
He took a long drag from his Marlboro as he reluctantly stood up.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#27:1>
Romina fantasized that the smoke came from the fiery breath that was
the dragon 's first volley at its enemy.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#28:1>
And the sounds of cheering coming from the television audience did
not seem to Romina meant for the big bald man who threw his opponent against
the ropes, but for the dragon who was about to instill terrible pain on the
tiger. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#29:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Yes? &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#30:1>
The man looked at Romina.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#31:1>
She suddenly felt that everything about her - - her floral-print
dress, which fell a good five inches below her knees, her long hair
unstylishly tied behind her head, her glasses - - were all wrong for the
occasion. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#32:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I want a tattoo, &rdquo; </quote> she tried to
sound firm but she pushed her plastic-framed glasses up her nose, like she
always did when she was nervous. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#33:1>
<quote> &ldquo; How old are you? &rdquo; </quote> the man smiled,
amused.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#34:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I don't do tattoos on minors. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#35:1>
Romina, who was only fifteen, said she was eighteen.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#36:1>
She knew the guy wouldn't ask for her ID.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#37:1>
Not on this street.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#38:1>
On this street, someone had set up a table on a corner, and was
selling diplomas certifying that his customers graduated from the country 's
top universities.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#39:1>
Others had tables and tables of term papers and theses for as low as
three hundred pesos a piece.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#40:1>
Leering men asked couples walking by if they wanted to rent a room
with a bed for a hundred pesos for a couple of hours.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#41:1>
No one asked for IDs, not on this street.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#42:1>
And yet, the man mocked her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#43:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Oh, I 'm eighteen, too, &rdquo; </quote> he said with
a laugh, his dark lips curling to show nicotine-stained teeth. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#44:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Are you Johnny? &rdquo; </quote> she asked.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#45:1>
And when the man nodded, she continued.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#46:1>
<quote> &ldquo; You were recommended by Miguel.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#47:1>
He said you did his tattoo. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#48:1>
Miguel was eighteen and had a three-inch tattoo of an angel in
the inner part of his left forearm.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#49:1>
Tiny feathers covered its small wings.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#50:1>
And its small cherub 's body was inspired by Cupid himself, though
instead of a bow and arrow, it carried a garland of roses. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#51:1>
And even if Romina didn't use to think that tattoos were all that
nice, she liked Miguel 's tattoo.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#52:1>
Romina liked Miguel, too.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#53:1>
He was in her Early Latin American History class.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#54:1>
He sat next to her in the second to the last row. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#55:1>
Of course, she had noticed him before, in the hallway and in
football games.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#56:1>
Normally, Romina didn't give guys like him a second glance.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#57:1>
Not because she was a snob.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#58:1>
Not at all.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#59:1>
She just knew, without any feeling of regret, that guys like Miguel
wouldn't give her a second glance.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#60:1>
But apparently Miguel was different; he was nice.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#61:1>
And, guys like Miguel were not usually nice to girls like Romina
because she knew, with an almost cruel self-knowledge, that she was plain.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#62:1>
She knew that her mouth was too wide for her small face; her eyes
could not be described as striking or soulful, they were chinky and just a
bit far apart, made worse by 250-grade prescription glasses; and her nose,
which she considered the ugliest part of her face, was small and squat,
unlike the pert little noses of pretty <foreign> <it> mestiza </it>
</foreign> girls.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#63:1>
She didn't even have the luck to come from a wealthy family,
something which would have made it easier to move in Miguel 's circle, people
who were looked up to by virtue of their Versace jeans and Cole Haan shoes.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#64:1>
It was during class that Romina really took notice of Miguel.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#65:1>
He had smiled at her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#66:1>
Romina was surprised.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#67:1>
She was not used to being singled out. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#68:1>
In the beginning, she only followed him around: to the cafeteria,
the parking lot, a few of his games.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#69:1>
Whenever he noticed she was there he would wave to her, not caring if
he was with his football teammates or some other friends, as if he wasn't
ashamed to greet her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#70:1>
And maybe that was all she needed to walk up the cafeteria counter at
the same moment that Miguel was purchasing a drink.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#71:1>
And instead of buying a cheap soda, she impulsively said the brand of
juice drink that Miguel was buying.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#72:1>
It cost more than her allowance could afford, but she thought it was
worth it.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#73:1>
Miguel had given her a wide smile. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#74:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Hi there, Romina, right? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#75:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Yeah. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#76:1>
She was thrilled.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#77:1>
She searched desperately for something witty and memorable to say.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#78:1>
But nothing came. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#79:1>
<quote> &ldquo; See ya. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#80:1>
He waved, and was gone.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#81:1>
She didn't have enough money for lunch that day but she didn't care.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#82:1>
Miguel had noticed her. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#83:1>
But what made Romina almost certain that she stood a chance with
him was the day in a class when he had picked up a pen which she had
nervously dropped.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#84:1>
To some, it would have meant nothing.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#85:1>
But the pen rolled all the way to the back row.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#86:1>
And instead of waiting for someone at the back to pass it up front,
Miguel had stood up to get it himself.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#87:1>
She had whispered almost inaudible thanks. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#88:1>
<quote> &ldquo; No problem, &rdquo; </quote> he answered with a
smile.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#89:1>
It was then she noticed his tattoo: the angel that was meticulously
inked on his skin seemed to be offering her the garland together with the pen
that Miguel held in his palm. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#90:1>
<quote> &ldquo; That 's nice, &rdquo; </quote> she whispered,
shy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#91:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Thanks. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#92:1>
And then, he winked at her. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#93:1>
Maybe it was the wink that did it, but something made her say,
putting the pen to her mouth, <quote> &ldquo; Y'know, I 've always wanted a
tattoo. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#94:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Really? &rdquo; </quote> Miguel 's eyes widened
just a fraction.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#95:1>
<quote> &ldquo; My friend Joanne has a tattoo, too.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#96:1>
She 's the only girl I know who has one. &rdquo;

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#97:1>
By the sound of his voice, it was obvious to Romina that he liked
Joanne.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#98:1>
By the way he was looking at her, she also knew that he now saw her
in a different light.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#99:1>
Similar perhaps, Romina thought, to the way he viewed Joanne, and she
was happy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#100:1>
Joanne must be one of those girls who came to school in designer
clothes and soft shiny hair, highlighted a fashionable brown in places which
caught the light.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#101:1>
She was invited to all the parties because everyone wanted to be
seen with her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#102:1>
She laughed out loud with the boys and flirted with them without
feeling shy at all.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#103:1>
She could also think of a witty remark to make a decent
conversation.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#104:1>
In that instant, Romina wanted to be a Joanne, a laughing, flirting,
sought-after Joanne. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#105:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I 've always wanted a tattoo of a butterfly.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#106:1>
But I don't know anyone who could do it well. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#107:1>
Romina knew it was not like her at all to cross her legs in the way
she imagined the Joannes of Miguel did.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#108:1>
But at that moment, she, too, crossed her legs, and swung her foot
even.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#109:1>
She even straightened her hair back and lifted her chin, and threw
her hair back as a sign of the new confidence she had felt the moment Miguel
had picked up her pen and winked. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#110:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I know this great place on Recto, &rdquo;
</quote> Miguel had said.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#111:1>
And he went on and on about Johnny and his tattoo shop, how good
Johnny was, how clean his method, how reasonable his price.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#112:1>
Romina had nodded eagerly and giggled, happily soaking in Miguel 's
attention.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#113:1>
She had decided she was going to get that tattoo, and had asked for
written directions to Johnny 's shop. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#114:1>
That night, she stood naked in front of her mirror, criticizing
her body, searching for just the right spot to put a tattoo.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#115:1>
Her arms, she thought, were too thin to give a tattoo any drama.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#116:1>
Even if she had the courage to put one just above her left breast,
so that it would peep above a blouse 's neckline, her breasts were too
insignificant to draw attention to them.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#117:1>
Her back would have been a good place, but a tattoo there would
always be out of sight.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#118:1>
And she wanted Miguel to notice.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#119:1>
She wondered where Joanne had her tattoo.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#120:1>
It must be in some uncreative place like her cleavage, she decided.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#121:1>
The idea made her laugh.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#122:1>
And what kind of tattoo would a girl like Joanne have?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#123:1>
She bet it would be a cute little heart.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#124:1>
Red, of course.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#125:1>
Ugh.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#126:1>
Surely, Miguel could not possibly like a girl like that for long.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#127:1>
Finally, after much deliberation, she settled on the part of her leg
just above the right ankle.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#128:1>
It was perfect.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#129:1>
Her legs she judged to be fairly pretty and nicely shaped as a
result of the many walks she took to save on bus fares.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#130:1>
Should she &ldquo; accidentally &rdquo; drop her pen, he would
surely notice. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#131:1>
All that had happened the previous week.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#132:1>
Romina would be meeting Miguel again for class next week, just
enough time for her to get that tattoo.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#133:1>
Romina couldn't wait to see him, to show him. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#134:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Yes, that 's right, &rdquo; </quote> the man
said.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#135:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Yeah, I know Miguel.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#136:1>
So what did you have in mind? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#137:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Uhmm, I wanted a butterfly just above my ankle.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#138:1>
<quote> <quote> &ldquo; Did you bring a design? &rdquo; </quote>
</p>

<p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#139:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Uh, no.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#140:1>
I was hoping you could help me. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#141:1>
The man took out a thick plastic folder from under the counter.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#142:1>
After flipping through it for a while, he inverted it and shoved it
towards Romina.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#143:1>
<quote> &ldquo; See if you like any of those. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#144:1>
The spread was filled with all sorts of winged insects.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#145:1>
There were dragonflies, mosquitoes, bugs and butterflies in
different stages of flight.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#146:1>
Some had their wings closed, like delicate petals.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#147:1>
Others were caught in mid-flight, as if about to ascend to the
skies, and others still had their wings fully spread, with intricate details
of veins, patterns and colors displayed to the fullest.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#148:1>
To Romina, they were all frightening.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#149:1>
Or maybe they were all beautiful.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#150:1>
Romina couldn't tell.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#151:1>
She couldn't tell which one was the best.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#152:1>
Or simply which Miguel would like. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#153:1>
<quote> &ldquo; How much does it cost? &rdquo; </quote> Romina 's
voice was soft, her eyes on the pictures. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#154:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Three thousand for a small to medium-sized one.
&rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#155:1>
The man took another drag from his cigarette and chuckled, his eyes
on the TV screen.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#156:1>
The bald guy on the screen was huffing and puffing at the camera.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#157:1>
Romina had a total of &peso;5,000 in her savings account, and she
had withdrawn almost everything, leaving only a few hundred pesos to keep the
account open.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#158:1>
She had not been sure how much the tattoo would cost.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#159:1>
It was all she had saved from what seemed like a thousand Christmas
and birthday presents.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#160:1>
She knew she could get a tattoo for much less, from an enterprising
art student, for example.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#161:1>
But this was the best shop in town, Miguel had said, and definitely
safe.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#162:1>
Johnny even had a certification from the Department of Health tacked
on his wall.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#163:1>
A fleeting thought crossed her mind -- something about the vendors
outside who sold fake documents.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-018#164:1>
But Romina brushed it away. </p> </I>
