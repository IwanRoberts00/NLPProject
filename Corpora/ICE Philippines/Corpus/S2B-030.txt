With the permission of uh the President I would like to uh
explain my vote
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#2:1:A>
<X> Mr President last Monday I delivered the invocation on behalf of
the Senate and in that I asked the Good Lord through his son Jesus Christ to
provide us the way <indig> mga daan at paraan para tayo ay makapaghusga ng V F
A sa tama at sa ikaliligaya ng ating bayang Pilipinas </indig> </X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#3:1:A>
Mr President I begin by asking why not
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#4:1:A>
Today the Senate of the eleventh Congress is being called upon to
concur or not to concur in the ratification of the Visiting Forces Agreement
V F A between the United States and the Republic of the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#5:1:A>
To be sure friends and foes of the V F A from the clergy to the
ordinary citizen have given me counsel and advice
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#6:1:A>
I received letters telegrams and telephone calls from so many
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#7:1:A>
I wish to place on record Mr President that I appreciate all these
advice and views solicited and otherwise given as they were to assist me in
evaluating the pros and cons of the V F A
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#8:1:A>
I cannot thank them enough for their concern but at the end of the
day Mr President the ball remains with me so to speak because the occasion
calls for each of the Senator to make a personal judgment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#9:1:A>
Consequently for those whose views and opinions I cannot accommodate
for the reasons I would later on explain I wish to thank them again for
enriching my perspectives
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#10:1:A>
I only hope that they will treat this matter as a case of clashing
opposing opinions and not a repudiation of their position
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#11:1:A>
<indig> Walang personalan trabaho po lang ito </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#12:1:A>
Mr President the solemn occasion today is not only to decide the
fate of the V F A but to do honor to the Filipino people who put me here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#13:1:A>
Let me assure therefore one and all that my decision is based on
what I personally believe in and what is best for the country and the
Filipinos
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#14:1:A>
The sponsors of the V F A have valiantly defended the provisions of
the V F A against the legal political and moral assaults by those who in good
faith oppose and or express reservation to the V F A
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#15:1:A>
They have replied with utmost sincerity and forthrightness to the
many questions that have been raised
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#16:1:A>
They have rebutted with logic sometimes evasive and convoluted but
most of the time rational and candid every argument raised against the V F A
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#17:1:A>
For sure there are various important concerns which my colleagues
have articulated and raised sometimes with utmost passion and with great
personal convictions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#18:1:A>
Concerns such as whether the V F A is a treaty or an international
agreement or a mere executive agreement whether the applicable constitutional
provision is Section twenty-five Article eighteen or Section twenty-one
Article seven whether the V F A would violate the nuclear-free provision of
Section eight Article two of the Constitution whether Americans will
automatically come to the aid of the Philippines if any of our claimed
territory is subjected to armed attack by foreign forces whether more
security and military assistance would be forthcoming whether more economic
support and more U S investment would come to the Philippines and finally
whether the Philippines has surrendered once again its criminal jurisdiction
over offenses committed in the Philippines by U S military personnels
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#19:1:A>
Mr President I share all these concerns but some of these concerns
cannot be resolved in this chamber with finality as they involve legal and
constitutional issues
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#20:1:A>
In due time I 'm sure Mr President the Supreme Court will be called
upon to rule on the validity of these legal propositions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#21:1:A>
After all as U S Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes observed and I
quote <quote> we are under a Constitution but the Constitution is what the
judges say it is </quote> unquote
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#22:1:A>
Until the Supreme Court shall have ruled otherwise Mr President I
subscribe to the legal proposition that the V F A is an international
agreement and that the applicable provision of the Constitution is Section
twenty-one Article eight Article seven
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#23:1:A>
This view is not without legal basis since the other uh provision
Section twenty-five Article eighteen obviously referred to the then-existing
nineteen forty-seven Military Bases Agreement between the United States and
the Philippines a state of fact that was not lost in the minds of the
Commissioners that drafted the nineteen eighty-seven Constitution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#24:1:A>
Thus I read Section twenty-five Article eighteen as providing a
constitutional guideline on the process of how the nineteen forty-seven
Military Bases Agreement were to be renewed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#25:1:A>
As it turned out Mr President this chamber terminated the M B A and
correctly so if I may add
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#26:1:A>
See debates record of the Constitutional Commission page six
hundred sixty-three
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#27:1:A>
I also believe that the V F A does not authorize any U S bases
facility or troops to be permanently maintained in the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#28:1:A>
No legal gobbledygook or language engineering would justify such an
interpretation of the provisions of the V F A
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#29:1:A>
I further believe Mr President that the one-year deadline to
terminate judicial proceedings against American personnel is more a challenge
to improve our delivery of justice system in this country than a legal burden
imposed by the V F A
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#30:1:A>
With respect to other concerns which are basically political social
and economic in character whether for instance America will provide more
military assistance whether more economic support and investment would come
from America <foreign> etcetera </foreign> I firmly believe that this is a
question of faith and trust faith that America will indeed deliver what it
promises and trust that our national leaders will see to it that these
promises are fulfilled
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#31:1:A>
Mr President for me the most important aspect of the V F A is the
question on jurisdiction over offenses committed by U S personnel against
Filipinos in our land
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#32:1:A>
The question has both legal and moral dimensions given our past
experience when the Military Bases Agreement was still extant
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#33:1:A>
It is on this issue that my position has been focused and which
would determine my vote
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#34:1:A>
The V F A for sure contains both exclusive and concurrent
jurisdiction over offenses committed by U S military personnel in the
Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#35:1:A>
With respect to exclusive jurisdiction the language is too clear
and categorical to merit further comments
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#36:1:A>
Suffice it to say Mr President that exclusive jurisdiction over
certain crimes committed by U S personnel goes in a way in favor of the
Philippines in certain cases and in favor of the U S in others
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#37:1:A>
Here Mr President the scale of justice to my view is evenly
balanced
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#38:1:A>
Additionally off-duty offenses regardless of the gravity that are
committed by U S military personnel on liberty or on pass are without any
doubt exclusively belong to Philippine jurisdiction
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#39:1:A>
Here happily both the U S and the Philippines agree paragraph three
subparagraph one point two joint report number forty-three of the Committee
on Foreign Relations and Committee on National Defense and Security page nine
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#40:1:A>
It is however in the category of concurrent and primary
jurisdiction that I have great reservations Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#41:1:A>
There are two vital points that concerns me
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#42:1:A>
First is the exception to the primary jurisdiction of the
Philippines under three B two <quote> even though the Philippines has primary
jurisdiction the same may be lost if the offenses arise out of any act or
omission done in the performance of official duty </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#43:1:A>
Once the military commander issue a duty certificate the same has
the effect of automatically divesting Philippine jurisdiction over the
offenses committed by U S personnel in violation of Philippine laws
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#44:1:A>
This obnoxious provision is found in the defunct Military Bases
Agreement and was the source of intense irritants between the Philippines and
the U S governments
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#45:1:A>
I hope to God that the Philippine government has learned from the
past and would now see to it that this provision is not abused by the U S
Military Commanders
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#46:1:A>
One way Mr President of preventing such abuse is to define the
meaning of <mention> official duty </mention> which incidentally is not
defined in the V F A
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#47:1:A>
This representation Mr President will recall offered and the
sponsors accepted the following definition of <mention> official duty
 </mention> and I quote <quote> the term <mention> official duty </mention> is
understood to be any duty or service required or authorized to be done by
statute regulation the order of a superior or military usage
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#48:1:A>
<mention> Official duty </mention> is not meant </quote> and I
would like to emphasize <quote> is not meant to include all acts by an
individual during the period during which he is on duty but is meant to apply
only to acts which are required or authorized to be done as a function of
that duty which the individual is performing </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#49:1:A>
Thus in the joint report happily the sponsor correctly stated that
crimes such as rape murder and similar heinous crimes cannot and should not
be included as having been performed in official duty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#50:1:A>
This definition was formally accepted as an amendment to resolution
four four three to wit <quote> whereas in order to ensure that not all
offenses by U S personnel arising out of any act or omission done in the
performance of official duty will not automatically be covered by a duty
certificate to be issued by the U S Military Commanders under paragraph E
Article five the term <mention> official duty </mention> as used in this
paragraph is hereby defined as follows </quote> again the definition <quote> 
the term <mention> official duty </mention> is understood to be any duty or
service required or authorized to be done by statute regulation the order of
a superior or military usage
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#51:1:A>
<mention> Official duty </mention> is not meant to include all acts
by an individual during the period while he is on duty but is meant to apply
only to acts which are required or authorized to be done as a function of
that duty which the individual is performing </quote> unquote
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#52:1:A>
From this definition Mr President which as embodied in resolution
four four three the validity or efficacy of the duty certificate to be issued
by the U S Military Commanders will be measured and if found wanting by the
Philippine authorities should be rejected without hesitation and equivocation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#53:1:A>
Given the dark history of the duty certificate like the hated
 <foreign> cedula </foreign> under Spain the new circumstances upon which the
V F A will be operable that is absence of permanent U S military bases
facilities and troops in the Philippines the new breed of national regional
and local <unclear> 1 word </unclear> leaders and finally the assertiveness
and vigilance of the N G Os and the students and the other sectors I have no
doubt that the past would never be resurrected nor replicated in the use of
duty certificate by U S Military Commanders
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#54:1:A>
I certainly would not allow it Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#55:1:A>
It behooves therefore the concerned Philippine authorities not to
take the words of the U S Military Commanders at face value
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#56:1:A>
They should be vigilant and strict to the point of being <indig> 
makulit </indig> <&> = be naggers </&> and <indig> matigas </indig> <&> =
being forceful or firm </&> in asserting resolution four four three as well
as the definition of <mention> official duty </mention> and evaluating the
circumstances and facts that have given rise to the issuance of the duty
certificate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#57:1:A>
In case of doubt Mr President the duty certificate once issued
should be reviewed and if found against the definition of official duty
should be rejected
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#58:1:A>
Happily the sponsors agreed to this approach
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#59:1:A>
Second is the language used
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#60:1:A>
Why is the V F A couched in a language distinctly different from
other similar instruments with respect to concurrent and primary jurisdiction
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#61:1:A>
More specifically I refer to the question of what appears to be an
automatic waiver of Philippine jurisdiction pursuant to paragraph three D
Article five which states and I quote <quote> recognizing the responsibility
of the United States military authorities to maintain good order and
discipline among their forces Philippine authorities will upon request by the
United States waive their primary right to exercise jurisdiction except in
cases of particular importance to the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#62:1:A>
<X> If the government of the Philippines determines that the case
is of particular importance it shall communicate such determination to the
United States authorities within twenty days after the Philippine authorities
received the <?> united </?> request </X> </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#63:1:A>
Yet on identical situation Mr President America agreed to a much
different nay apparently more liberal language with respect to her Agreements
with other countries
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#64:1:A>
For instance the Agreement with Japan on the same situation states
and I quote <quote> if the state having the primary right decides not to
exercise jurisdiction it shall notify the authorities of the other state as
soon as practicable
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#65:1:A>
<X> The authorities of the state having the primary right shall
give sympathetic consideration to a request from the authorities of the other
state for a waiver of its right in cases where that order other state
considers such a waiver to be of particular importance </X> </quote> Article
seventeen paragraph thirty-six of the Agreement between Japan and the United
States
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#66:1:A>
Similarly Mr President the Agreement with South <.> Ame </.> South
Korea Australia and the NATO countries to mention just a few contain the same
language as Japan
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#67:1:A>
Instead of <mention> automatic waiver </mention> the <mention> 
sympathetic consideration </mention> are the passwords in these countries
with respect to waiver of primary jurisdiction
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#68:1:A>
Mr President the phrase <mention> sympathetic consideration
 </mention> does not convey to me as the same as <mention> automatic waiver
 </mention> found in the V F A
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#69:1:A>
Yet during the several public hearings we were told that the
particular V F A language is no different in import than those found in
Agreements with Japan South Korea Australia and the NATO countries because
the V F A provides an escape clause for the Philippines where it can always
deny the request of waiver of jurisdiction over cases which are of particular
importance to the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#70:1:A>
If indeed the import of the language quote <mention> sympathetic
consideration </mention> unquote is similar to quote <mention> automatic
waiver </mention> unquote why did our negotiator not insist on the former
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#71:1:A>
In fact in the defunct Military Bases Agreement <mention> 
sympathetic consideration </mention> was the language used in the Agreement
paragraph three C Article thirteen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#72:1:A>
Are our negotiator less tenacious than their counterpart from the
other countries
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#73:1:A>
Or do they really believe that despite the difference in the
nomenclature the meaning is the same
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#74:1:A>
If the language in Section three D Mr President is left by itself
without any amendment of the V F A or subsequent clarificatory and binding
undertaken undertaking from the concerned Philippine authorities from the
executive department then it is obvious that there is indeed a difference and
that such difference places the Philippines in unequal footing with America
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#75:1:A>
That situation is <indig> nakakahiya </indig> <&> = shameful </&> 
and definitely unacceptable to me Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#76:1:A>
I cannot overemphasize my personal concern on the subject of fair
and equal administration of justice because I see a great number of Filipinos
being deprived of elementary due process and justice
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-030#77:1:A>
It is bad enough Mr President that at the hands of a fellow <indig> 
Pinoy </indig> another <indig> Pinoy </indig> becomes a victim of injustice
It is worst and unforgivable if a <indig> Pinoy </indig> will suffer
injustice at the hands of a foreigner in cases involving crimes committed in
the Philippines </I>
