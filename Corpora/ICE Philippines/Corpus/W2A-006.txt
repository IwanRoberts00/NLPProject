<h> <bold> Introduction </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#4:1>
N.V.M. Gonzalez, in his literary autobiography, <indig> <it>
Kalutang </indig> : A Filipino in the World </it> , describes his experience
as a Filipino writer in English using the image of the Hanunoo Mangyan
walking down the mountain trail interminably making music with two wooden
sticks - the <indig> <it> kalutang </it> </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#5:1>
According to Hanunoo beliefs, when a person travels, his or her soul
trails along and the song from the <indig> <it> kalutang </it> </indig> helps
the soul to know where the body is.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#6:1>
This playing of the <indig> <it> kalutang </it> </indig> is important
because, according to the Hanunoos, the soul can be distracted by things
along the way or be waylaid by forest spirits.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#7:1>
Without the music of the kalutang the soul may not find the body and
remain lost in the forests! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#8:1>
Gonzalez uses this motif as frame for narration of his experiences
as a Filipino writer in English, literally and figuratively travelling in
foreign lands, seeking his way home.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#9:1>
Gonzalez writes a literary autobiography that documents the impact of
colonialism and neocolonialism on his personal history, as well as on the
other Filipino writers in English of his generation. </p> 3. 4.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#10:1>
<h> <bold> Translation as a Playing of the <indig> <it> Kalutang
</it> </indig> </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#11:1>
In this paper, I am using the metaphor developed by Gonzalez to
underscore the importance of the translation of Philippine literature in
English into Filipino.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#12:1>
I am referring mainly, but not exclusively, to literary writings in
English by the first two generations of Filipino writers in English who were
educated and wrote during the period of American colonization and the period
immediately after.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#13:1>
The translation of these works can be a form of recuperation or
resocialization by making them accessible to more Filipinos and by
reappropriating them as a part of the mainstream Philippine literature.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#14:1>
In other words, translation is a way of playing the <indig> <it>
kalutang </it> </indig> , a way of bringing these texts 'home'. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#15:1>
This paper asserts that the translation of Philippine writing in
English to Filipino is a political act, a contribution to the process of
decolonization of our country.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#16:1>
Translation is a playing of the <indig> <it> kalutang </it> </indig>
, a ritual of healing the split between the national <foreign> psyche
</foreign> and the body caused by colonization and maintained by its new
forms.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#17:1>
Translation of these texts can contribute to this process of healing
by memorializing the wounds of neocolonization that are presented,
consciously or subconsciously, in the form and images of these texts.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#18:1>
This translation project aims to memorialize the fact of colonization
and neocolonization for a people notorious for its short memory, for a people
with a tendency to forget the wounds inflicted by colonization in order to
avoid dealing with it.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#19:1>
The translation, at the same time, aims to memorialize the resources
of a people to heal its wounds, resources that are also portrayed in some of
these texts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#20:1>
For example, in N.V.M. Gonzalez 's novel, <it> A Season of Grace
</it> ( 1954), just as Sabel deftly weaves a <indig> banig </indig> with the
word <foreign> &ldquo; Recuerdo &rdquo; </foreign> ( Remember), the author
weaves a novel that calls Filipinos to remember who they are.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#21:1>
Richard Guzman, a literary critic, points out that Gonzalez in his
novel is countering the dominant myths in Filipino neo-colonial society:
<quote> &ldquo; the myths of the Philippines ' irretrievably lost native
past, of her people 's weakness, of the near triumph of the foreign &rdquo;
</quote> ( 1995:182).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#22:1>
What countermyth does Gonzalez offer?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#23:1>
Gonzalez uses images of farmers crossing seas on frail <foreign>
batels </foreign> like migrant rats, of hawks preying on chicken, of burnt
loam teeming with life underneath the ashes - symbols of what Gonzalez calls
the essential stories of Filipino life. <fnr> <sp> 1 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#24:1>
Guzman explores such symbols in <mention> <it> A Season of Grace
</it> </mention> and rediscovers the inner strength of the Filipino in the
face of extensive corruption, social indifference, violence, and colonial
mentality that plague contemporary Filipino society.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#25:1>
Guzman concludes: <quote> &ldquo; The native culture will survive, it
seems to say, and by an inner strength that antedates colonialism &rdquo;
</quote> ( p. 189). </p> 5. 6.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#26:1>
<h> <bold> Definition of Translation </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#27:1>
Translation as a playing of the <indig> <it> kalutang </it>
</indig> entails transforming the English texts into Filipino.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#28:1>
Translation cannot merely be a transliteration, a word for word
equivalence, from English to Filipino.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#29:1>
According to Rabasa ( 1989:1), translation is a transformation, a
form of adaptation of an original text from one language to another.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#30:1>
The process of translation is determined both by the interpreter and
the circumstance, and this circumstance is <quote> &ldquo; a very clearly
inscribed cultural and historical context" </quote> ( Basanett-MacGuire
1991:xi). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#31:1>
The anthropologist James T. Siegel sees a pervasive connection
between translation and affirming or resisting a particular social order.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#32:1>
Vicente Rafael, who uses Siegel in his study, describes the way
Siegel conceives of the process of translation as &ldquo; the process of
reshaping one 's thoughts and actions in accordance with the accepted norms
of a community. &rdquo; <O> rest of quotation </O> ( Rafael, 1988:210-211)
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#33:1>
The context or the social order wherein this translation project
occurs is postcolonial.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#34:1>
In such a context, translation between the language of the
ex-colonizer and the language of the ex-colonized becomes a political act, a
power struggle.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#35:1>
Given our historico-socio-political situation, English is seen as a 'stronger'
and 'dominating' language vis-&aacute;-vis Filipino which is seen as the 'weaker'
and 'dominated' language.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#36:1>
Talal Asad ( in &ldquo; Concept of Cultural Translation", 157, cited
in Villareal 1993) writes: <quote> &ldquo; ...because the languages of Third
World countries... are &ldquo; weaker &rdquo; in relation to Western
languages ( and today, especially to English), they 're more likely to submit
to forcible transformation in the translation process than the other way
around." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#37:1>
Translation is not merely a transposition of one language to
another, but also that of a culture to another culture.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#38:1>
Translation is an interaction, inevitably a power struggle between
two different value systems. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#39:1>
Note that in the translation of Filipino literature in English,
we are translating from Filipino English, in itself a form of &ldquo;
translation", a locus of interaction between the Filipino writers ' native
tongue with the culture and history it contains and that of the English of
the Anglo-American.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#40:1>
I believe that Filipino English as used by Filipino writers,
Gonzalez, for example, is a form of documentation of neocolonization and the
Filipino writers ' struggle to resist and appropriate what is foreign
according to Filipino purposes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#41:1>
However, despite the development of a Filipino English, N.V.M.
Gonzalez realizes the need to translate Philippine writing in English to
Filipino.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#42:1>
<O> Long quotation </O> </p> 7. 8.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#43:1>
<h> <bold> Translation as a Valid Academic Exercise </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#44:1>
It is not only the body of Filipino writings in English that
needs bringing home.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#45:1>
The Filipino academic, who in the Philippine context is often both
student ( <foreign> i.e. </foreign> , researcher) and the teacher, working on
English language and literature, needs to go home, too.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#46:1>
In a recent teacher training seminar conducted by the Ateneo Center
for English Language Teaching, Filipino teachers of English admitted their
feeling of inadequacy in talking of Philippine culture in their English
language and literature classes even when the texts used are Philippine
writings in English.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#47:1>
Several of the teacher participants from Metro Manila and other
nearby provinces spoke of how their own education as teachers had
Americanized them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#48:1>
This shows how the Filipino academic working on English language
and literature does not need to go literally abroad to be alienated from the
majority of Filipinos who are more and more losing proficiency in the use of
the English language.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#49:1>
The Filipino academic is constantly out on the trail ( by
professional necessity), entering foreign forests to hunt for 'food' and 'medicine'
( language and literary theories and concepts) for the tribe 's ( Filipino
society, especially, the academic 's students) survival.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#50:1>
In his or her journeys, the soul of the Filipino academic working on
English language and literature is constantly bombarded by foreign
interpellations that may waylay it from his body.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#51:1>
Without the soul, the Filipino academic cannot remember who he is,
where he is from, why he is where he is, and where he is going.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#52:1>
It is the rhythm of his <indig> <it> kalutang </it> </indig> that
serves as a shield or <indig> <it> pangontra </it> </indig> that allows him
to interpellate back these voices.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#53:1>
Without the <indig> <it> kalutang </it> </indig> , the Filipino
academic working on English language and literature is doomed to the fate of
an external exile in his own land - without a tribe, without a home, without
a self.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#54:1>
For the Filipino academic working on English language and literature,
this <indig> <it> kalutang </it> </indig> , this cultural shield, this
<indig> <it> pangontra </it> </indig> , is something indigenous, native, most
himself - his native language.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#55:1>
Translation therefore is an enterprise the Filipino academic has to
engage in out of necessity, to save his or her soul. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#56:1>
Moreover, this paper asserts that translation projects and
studies are fields worthy of academics.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#57:1>
Contrary to the prevalent misconception of translation as &ldquo;
less intellectual &rdquo; compared to the traditional research projects,
translation in fact provides the crucible for testing the Filipino academic
understanding of foreign concepts and wisdom in applying these to concrete
Filipino experience.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#58:1>
Ms. Benilda Santos, Ateneo de Manila professor, poet, and translator,
regards translations as <quote> &ldquo; a most necessary academic pursuit for
academicians. &rdquo; </quote> <O> rest of long quotation </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#59:1>
These Filipino academics in English can be invaluable to the
Filipino community if they write in or translate into Filipino.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#60:1>
They are in contact with the ideas of the international community
which uses English as its <foreign> lingua franca </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#61:1>
They are in a position to interpellate the neo-colonial powers and
question their ambitions.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#62:1>
They are in a position to contribute the Filipino worldview to global
discussions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#63:1>
Tinio recognizes this need for Filipinos who are expert in both
English and Filipino.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#64:1>
He writes <quote> &ldquo; ...we need Filipinos with real expertise in
English; they are the ones who will provide us a link with the English
world." </quote> <O> rest of long quotation </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#65:1>
This discussion on bilingualism shows the recognition of the
growing importance of the translator in Philippine society.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#66:1>
Rolando Tinio ( 1993:147) points to the important role of bilingual
Filipinos: <O> long quotation in Filipino </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#67:1>
Dr. Eugene Nida, world-renowned expert on linguistics and
translation, in his visit to the Ateneo University last November 1998
asserted that though the trend globally is that of more and more non-English
speaking people studying English to participate in international
transactions, the impetus to preserve the native languages will be strong as
well for people to nurture their national identity.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#68:1>
Again we see here the crucial role of bilingual academics, especially
in translation from English to Filipino and from Filipino to English. </p> 9.

<h> <bold> Conclusion </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#70:1>
This paper asserts the importance of translating Filipino
literature in English to Filipino for the following reasons: </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#71:1>
First, despite the development of a Filipino English, Philippine
literature in English remains a small tributary of the mainstream of Filipino
literature in the vernacular and remains inaccessible to the majority of
Filipinos.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#72:1>
The translation of Philippine literature in English to Filipino will
make available to the majority of Filipinos, especially to students, a
significant body of texts containing reflections on Filipino experiences
especially of American colonization and neocolonization, certainly a rich
area of study. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#73:1>
Second, this translation, aside from making Philippine literature
in English accessible to more Filipinos, is a contribution to the continuing
process of decolonization.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#74:1>
In translating these texts, we are memorializing the wounds of
colonization and neocolonization and the resources of a people to heal these
wounds.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#75:1>
We encourage the use of these Filipino translations of Philippine
literature in English in the secondary and tertiary level literature
curricula in this framework of continuing decolonization of our country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#76:1>
Third, this project affirms the value of translation as a field
worthy of academics.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#77:1>
It is not &ldquo; less intellectual &rdquo; compared to the
traditional research projects, but in fact provides the crucible for testing
the Filipino academic 's understanding of foreign concepts and wisdom in
applying these to concrete Filipino experiences.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#78:1>
The bilingual Filipino academic is in the best position to contribute
to this translation project. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#79:1>
We started with the image of the Hanunoo Mangyan travelling down
the mountain trail, hunting for food and medicine for the tribe, interminably
playing the <indig> <it> kalutang </it> </indig> to make sure he doesn't lose
his soul.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#80:1>
We are using this image to show how the Filipino academic, constantly
in contact with foreign learning and concepts ( <foreign> e.g. </foreign>
language and literary theories and concepts), needs to constantly translate,
to go back to his native language. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-006#81:1>
May we join this traveler then as he continues the journey, unafraid
to foray in foreign forests, knowing that the transformations he
undergoes as he interacts with the outside world is part of his
becoming, as long as he puts his kalutang to music to call his
soul home. </I>
