<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#8:1>
Dear <bold> Dr. Garcia </bold> ,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#9:1>
In behalf of the Technical Panel for Humanities, Social Sciences
and Communication, I am honored to submit our recommended General Education
Curriculum ( GEC) for autonomous and deregulated HEIs. <&> =Higher Education
Institutions </&> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#10:1>
The new GEC, which we call <mention> 'GEC-C' </mention> , aims to
reinforce the benefits of autonomous and deregulated status, as specified in
CMO No. 32, series of 2001.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#11:1>
By exempting them from the requirement to offer at least 63 General
Education units for degree programs in humanities, social sciences, and
communication ( GEC-A, per CMO No. 59, series of 1996) and/or at least 51
General Education units for other programs ( GEC-B, per CM No. 4, series of
1997), it will allow autonomous and deregulated HEIs to adopt more flexible
and open curricula, to experiment with more electives in major courses, and
to offer students greater participation in the design of their courses of
study.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#12:1>
It thus strikes a balance between the need for a uniform national
General Education and the need for innovation on the part of autonomous and
deregulated HEIs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#13:1>
The new GEC-C requires 36 units only - 9 units of humanities
courses ( except language courses), 12 units of mathematics and natural
science courses, 12 units of the social sciences and 3 units for the mandated
course, which is the Life and Works of Rizal. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#14:1>
We hope it will merit your favorable approval.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#15:1>
Attached is the draft CHED Memorandum Order for the said GEC. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#16:1>
Very truly yours,

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#17:1>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#26:2>
Dear Dr. Mojares:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#27:2>
For several decades now, <it> DLSU Dialogue </it> , an
interdisciplinary journal for cultural studies, has been serving the academic
community as a semiannual periodical primarily carrying research articles by
faculty of De La Salle University. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#28:2>
Starting January, 2000, the journal will be transformed into a
refereed journal open to contributions from scholars residing both in and
outside the Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#29:2>
It will change its focus from general interdisciplinary studies to
specifically cultural studies, preferably of the Asia-Pacific geographical
area to which the Philippines belongs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#30:2>
As it has in the past, the journal will accept both theoretical
and empirical studies of the usual journal length. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#31:2>
To prepare for this change of focus, the journal would like to
have an International Editorial Board, whose members will occasionally be
asked to read and approve articles within their areas of expertise.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#32:2>
It is envisioned that a Board member will read at most one article a
year.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#33:2>
Needless to say, there will be a modest honorarium for each reading.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#34:2>
I hope you will join us in this attempt to provide a Philippine
outlet for serious scholarly efforts in the field of cultural studies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#35:2>
Thank you very much. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#36:2>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#45:3>
Dear Atty. Buhain:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#46:3>
The Manila Critics Circle would like to propose for your
consideration the sponsorship by the National Book Development Board of the
National Book Awards given annually to the best books published in the
Philippines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#47:3>
As you know, the Circle has given out the Awards every year since
1982.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#48:3>
The Awards ordinarily consist of trophies designed by major Filipino
sculptors ( for example, for the past few years, the Circle has been using a
design by National Artist Napoleon Abueva) or equivalent plaques, given out
in appropriate ceremonies during the annual Philippine Bookfair held at SM
Megamall in Mandaluyong City. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#49:3>
Is it possible for the NBDB to allocate &peso;100,000 for the
National Book Awards this year? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#50:3>
Enclosed are an invitation to last year 's awarding ceremonies,
with information on the Circle and on the Awards, and a listing of the books
that have won Awards. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#51:3>
We hope that you can help us in this endeavor.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#52:3>
It is our understanding that the NBDB is exploring ways to encourage
good books by our publishers.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#53:3>
This would be a simple and concrete way to help our publishers. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#54:3>

Dear Dr. Claveria:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#62:4>
This will introduce the bearer, Ms. Rowena Locsin, who has been
assigned to you during the Third Term SY 2000-01 as your Student Assistant (
SA).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#63:4>
As a STUFAP scholar, s/he is expected to render THIRTY ( 30) HOURS of
service to you from 22 January to 24 March. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#64:4>
STUFAP has requested the Fellows to prepare a regular schedule
for the scholars, to be submitted to the STUFAP office by 22 January.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#65:4>
Please ask your SA to furnish me a copy of your agreed schedule. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#66:4>
STUFAP also reminds you that <quote> &ldquo; should the student
report to you as per your agreed schedule but you have no assignment to give
to the student at that time, please consider the student as to have complied
with the hours required for that period." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#67:4>
It is important not to assign any work to your SA after 24 March,
because s/he will have to prepare for the final examinations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#68:4>
Your SA will fill in the attached Attendance Record.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#69:4>
Please ask her/him to fill in also the &ldquo; Remarks &rdquo;
portion with suggestions for improving the service assistantship program.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#70:4>
At the end of the term, please initial the form before s/he submits
it to me.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#71:4>
I shall then countersign the Record before sending it myself to
STUFAP.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#72:4>
The completion of thirty hours of service is a requirement for the
renewal of the STUFAP grant for the next term. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#73:4>
The STUFAP Committee, in its meeting on 17 March 1995, defined
the duties of Student Assistants in this way: <quote> &ldquo; These students
will render research assistantship and will not be given purely menial
assignments, routine clerical tasks, or office work.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#74:4>
The reason for this change is to make the Assistantship Program a
truly challenging and enriching experience for these deserving grantees.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#75:4>
As much as possible, please do not send your SA out of the
campus.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#76:4>
There is no insurance program covering their trips outside the
campus, and fears have also been raised about their safety.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#77:4>
If an off-campus trip is unavoidable, please be sure to give your SA
enough money for transportation.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#78:4>
Needless to say, if you ask your SA to do anything that involves
money, such as photocopying, please be sure to advance the money.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#79:4>
The scholars receive only free tuition and fees, and no allowances
for books, transportation, or living expenses. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#80:4>
Any suggestions to improve the program are, of course, welcome.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#81:4>
You may communicate these to me or directly to the STUFAP Director.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#82:4>
Thank you very much for your usual cooperation. </p>

Dear Dr. Quebengco:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#92:5>
According to the Minutes of the Council of Deans Meeting held on
22 July 1999, Accounting will set up an Extension Office at the Angelo King
International Center to service the needs of CELL and SDRC. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#93:5>
I wish to formally request that the Accounting Extension Office
also serve the needs of the DLSU Press office at the ground floor of the
Angelo King International Center. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#94:5>
As requested by CSB, the DLSU Press office will sell school
supplies for the students taking classes at the Center.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#95:5>
Since the DLSU Press office serves as the headquarters of its
newly-formed Textbook Division, it will also sell textbooks to students and
outside customers.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#96:5>
The cash receipts at that office can and should be deposited in the
Accounting Extension Office at the end of each working day. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#97:5>
We hope that the extra services of the Accounting Extension
Office can be covered by the current Accounting Services monthly fee the DLSU
Press gives to the Accounting Office. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#98:5>
Thank you very much. </p>

Dear Bro. Gus:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#114:6>
De La Salle University Press is embarking on a project named
<mention> &ldquo; Lasallian Textbooks for Lasallian Schools, &rdquo;
</mention> the general objective of which is to be able to supply schools in
the District with textbooks written by teachers teaching within the Lasallian
family. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#115:6>
We would like to involve the schools in the Bacolod area in this
project. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#116:6>
Is it possible for USLS and yourself to host a meeting of the

Dear Bien,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#175:10>
The CHED Subcommittee on Literature needs your comments on the
enclosed draft of the major programs for AB Literature, Philippine
Literature, Comparative Literature, and Creative Writing.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#176:10>
You are the sole consultant, because the CLA represents all of the
existing organizations related to literature. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#177:10>
Although you do not have to comment on the syllabi for
Literature One and Literature Two ( because the CHED Subcommittee studies the
major programs rather than the core curriculum), I would also appreciate your
comments on those.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#178:10>
I actually already submitted them to CHED for dissemination, but
there is time to make some minor revisions when we go out to train the
literature teachers in January 1997.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#179:10>
( Please note that the Literature One syllabus comes directly from
the CCP Encyclopedia entries.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#180:10>
The Literature Two syllabus I got from various books.) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-016#181:10>
Thank you for your usual donation of your time and expertise.
