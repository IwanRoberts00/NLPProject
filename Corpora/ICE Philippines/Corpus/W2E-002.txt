<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#1:1>
<h> <bold> What, pray, are the facts? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#2:1>
HERE we go overboard again on the floods triggered by a leak in a
tailings impoundment dam of Marcopper Mining on Marinduque Island. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#3:1>
What is not at issue is that two rivers have overflowed their
banks because of the release of 1.5 million metric tons of muddy waters from
the impounded dam.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#4:1>
It has also been established that about 500 families have been
isolated by the floodwaters. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#5:1>
What is not clear is whether the outflow from the dam is toxic.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#6:1>
Marcopper officials said it isn't.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#7:1>
They said it 's water mixed with finely ground particles.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#8:1>
They added the chemicals the copper mine uses are not toxic at the
applied concentration. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#9:1>
&ldquo; Experts &rdquo; sitting on their chairs in Manila,
however, insist the waters are <quote> &ldquo; toxic. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#10:1>
They point to the studies that heavy metals such as cobalt, mercury,
and molybdenum - - by-products of copper mining - - pose a threat to health,
in the long term.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#11:1>
For all we know, they could be right. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#12:1>
The glaring omission in the reports, however, is that no
government agency has come up nearly a week after the leak was first reported
with the finding on the toxicity of the dam waters.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#13:1>
What gives?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#14:1>
It is simplicity enough to take samples from the main impoundment
dam, then from spots, say, every kilometer downstream.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#15:1>
The science department and the universities surely have more than
enough spectroscopic instruments to determine the presence of the heavy
elements and their concentrations.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#16:1>
There are also the assay laboratories of other mining companies and
of the independents, such as SGS. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#17:1>
Instead of such hard data, officials offer anecdotal evidence of
a teenager and his uncle who felt very dizzy and nauseated after eating fish
from one of the affected rivers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#18:1>
This isn't science.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#19:1>
This is <indig> kwentong kutsero </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#20:1>
There are some 7 <indig> barangays </indig> said to be on the paths
of the Boac and Makulapnit rivers.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#21:1>
And they are now telling us two cases of a bum stomach are proof of
the rivers being poisoned? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#22:1>
With the coming of the Aquarian age and the emergence of the cult
of Gaia, the Earth Mother, it is distinctly reactionary to talk about the
scientific culture.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#23:1>
But that 's what we are missing in reports about the Marcopper
&ldquo; disaster. &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#24:1>
From the feudal superstition, we, or rather the politically
correct, jumped right into &ldquo; New Age &rdquo; mysticism.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#25:1>
We seem to have thoroughly missed out the age of science. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#26:1>
The result is, not surprisingly, abysmal mass ignorance.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#27:1>
It could make a thinking man weep. </p>


<I>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#28:2>
<h> <bold> Enough of hypocrisy </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#29:2>
<indig> LAKAS </indig> - NUCD should stop their hypocritical
posturing over Hilarion Ramiro.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#30:2>
<indig> Lakas </indig> isn't the Round Table.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#31:2>
Everybody knows <indig> Lakas </indig> has never advertised leading a
virtuous life as a qualification for party membership. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#32:2>
No, we are not naming names.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#33:2>
But the <indig> Lakas </indig> national leadership can meet anytime
and we are pretty confident not one of its members can presumptuously claim
he is the reincarnation of Sir Galahad, the pure of heart. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#34:2>
<indig> Lakas </indig> ' attempt to distance itself from the
stench accompanying the uncovering of the corruption at the Department of
Health during the watch of Ramiro is understandable.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#35:2>
Ramiro is a <indig> Lakas </indig> &ldquo; orig, &rdquo; <&>
orig=original </&> one who not so humbly described himself as among <quote>
&ldquo; the best and the brightest &rdquo; </quote> in President Ramos '
vehicle for his presidential bid in 1992. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#36:2>
If he is among the best and the brightest, what does that make of
the rest of the <indig> Lakas </indig> guys?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#37:2>
The worst and dullest? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#38:2>
If only for that left-handed compliment, the <indig> Lakas
</indig> rank and file have all the right to demand Ramiro 's expulsion.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#39:2>
It was Lakas, which pushed for the appointment of Ramiro.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#40:2>
Party leaders should take their cue from President Ramos.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#41:2>
They should all apologize for this disaster they foisted on us. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#42:2>
But they should spare us the sermon on morals.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#43:2>
Sen. Leticia Ramos Shahani may keep flagging her dead horse of a
moral recovery program.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#44:2>
But polls will be polls.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#45:2>
With elections due two years from now, they will all be preparing
their war chests.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#46:2>
Guess where they will get the money? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#47:2>
<indig> Lakas </indig> is proud of having 95 percent of elected
officials under its fold.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#48:2>
It 's the ruling party; that should not be surprising.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#49:2>
But most of the current members did not join <indig> Lakas </indig>
because of the moral virtues of the &ldquo; origs &rdquo; like, ah, Ramiro.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#50:2>
They knew which side of the bread is buttered.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#51:2>
And it isn't <indig> Laban </indig> , Nationalist People 's Coalition
or the Liberal Party. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#52:2>
If <indig> Lakas </indig> kicks out Ramiro, then it must be
prepared to expel most of its members.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#53:2>
Graft and corruption stares us right in our faces.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#54:2>
Since <indig> Lakas </indig> members control practically all national
and local offices, the party cannot toss the blame on anybody else. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#55:2>
That 's the danger with putting on the cloak of moral
uprightness.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#56:2>
People might mistakenly believe the hypocrites.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#57:2>
And seriously expect them to live up to their pronouncements of
virtue. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Nice job </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#59:3>
THOSE who have given up on government should take heart.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#60:3>
The executive may be reeling under the corruption scandal that led to
the resignation of Hilarion Ramiro.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#61:3>
Congress is holding inquiries right and left in aid of everything but
legislation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#62:3>
But the consensus on economic reforms is that the central program
of the Ramos administration is holding.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#63:3>
As long as Congress and the executive hold the course, we can forgive
them their antics. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#64:3>
Yesterday President Ramos signed into law four major economic
bills.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#65:3>
In each, there were opportunities for mischief and some legislators
allowed not the opportunity to pass without grandstanding.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#66:3>
In the end, good sense - - and party line - - prevailed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#67:3>
The lifting of quantitative restrictions on agricultural imports
and their replacement with tariffs ( RA 8178) writes <foreign> finis
</foreign> to the failed policy of self-sufficiency that had long prevented
the country from pursuing the export and market-oriented strategy that
underpins the phenomenal growth of our Asian neighbors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#68:3>
The passage of the law could not have come any sooner.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#69:3>
The World Trade Organization gave the country a March 30 deadline to
dismantle the dizzying structures of import prohibitions, licensing and
quotas built over the years and covering such wide ranging products as corn
and onions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#70:3>
Deregulation of the oil industry for a time seemed to have become
a political football between the Senate and the Congress, with the dispute
centering on the tariff differential between imports of crude and oil
products.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#71:3>
This was a side issue.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#72:3>
The point was to depoliticize the oil industry.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#73:3>
Republic Act 8180 does it, even with that unwieldy automatic pricing
scheme in the transition. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#74:3>
Republic Act 8179 makes easier the entry of foreign investors.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#75:3>
But the Foreign Investments Act is long in place.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#76:3>
This is just a sweetener, especially for Filipinos who have acquired
another citizenship to own land for housing and business.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#77:3>
The attempt to re-introduce the Negative List C, which enumerates
businesses &ldquo; adequately served &rdquo; by Filipino nationals and thus,
closed to foreigners, thankfully did not pass. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#78:3>
Republic Act 8181 changes the basis of computing the value of
trade goods from home consumption value to transaction value, with a
transition stage through the so-called Brussels definition ( wholesale value
in the country of origin).

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#79:3>
The Philippines remains among the very few countries still sticking
to the unwieldy home consumption value system which relies on some phantom
price set by bureaucrats.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#80:3>
The shift to transaction will make pricing of goods realistic and can
only benefit both producers and consumers.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#81:3>
To Congress, nice job. </p> </I>


<I>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#82:4>
<h> <bold> A House oversight on EVAT </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#83:4>
THERE 's logic on the side of house members in granting a
presumptive input tax of 4 percent to government contractors in computing
their 10 percent value added tax. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#84:4>
The 10 percent VAT is taken into account by the contractors when
preparing their proposals.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#85:4>
They obviously just tack on the tax to their bids.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#86:4>
The government pays higher.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#87:4>
It gets back the added costs through VAT collections. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#88:4>
But why 4 percent in the House Bill passed seeking to amend the
Expanded VAT law?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#89:4>
And does this mean they no longer enjoy the VAT input credits on the
raw materials and services that go into their projects?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#90:4>
Our reading is that this presumptive input tax is in addition to VAT
input credits.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#91:4>
The result is that government contractors are practically VAT exempt.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#92:4>
Well, as we have said, applying VAT on government contracts is taking
money away from one government pocket and putting it in another.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#93:4>
Nothing to it, really. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#94:4>
What is not easily understood is why the House set a lower 2
percent presumptive input tax on agricultural processors.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#95:4>
A 4 percent presumptive input tax would have been just fine as
recommended by economists from academe.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#96:4>
It would correct the penalty imposed on agricultural processors under
the VAT system. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#97:4>
Why agricultural processors are penalized started innocently
enough from the best of intentions.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#98:4>
Under the original VAT and the EVAT, unprocessed agricultural,
fishery, and livestock products are exempt.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#99:4>
This is to spare people from higher food prices that would result
from VAT on unprocessed agriculture, fishery and livestock products. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#100:4>
Processors of these products, however, are slapped the full 10
percent VAT.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#101:4>
They have to shoulder the full tax unlike other industries which can
deduct from their VAT liabilities the VAT paid on their raw materials. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#102:4>
There goes the avowed government program of developing
agri-business with this crippling tax of 10 percent, not on the value added,
but on the gross sales of agri processors.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#103:4>
A 2 percent credit would ease the tax rate to 8 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#104:4>
But this is still higher than the tax burden, of, say hotels and
restaurants which under VAT benefitted from the elimination of the 5 percent
sales tax. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#105:4>
Now, who is the congressman in his right mind who would argue
that hotels and restaurants deserve a higher tax break than agri-processors
which have direct backward linkages to farmers, fishermen, and livestock
raisers? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#106:4>
The Senate contingent will do well to correct the anomaly when
the EVAT amendments go before a bicameral committee. </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#108:5>
WHAT do the following commodities have in common?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#109:5>
* Onions, potatoes, garlic, and cabbages.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#110:5>
* Roasted coffee beans, roasted ground coffee, instant soluble
coffee, and raw coffee of <foreign> robusta </foreign> , <foreign> excelsa
</foreign> , and <foreign> liberica </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#111:5>
* Leaf tobacco not meant for blending purposes. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#112:5>
* Rice, corn, and their substitutes, by-products or end products.
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#113:5>
* Cattle for breeding and slaughter and beef. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#114:5>
* Corn and its substitutes, including wheat used for feeds, poultry
and poultry products, pork and pork products, meat and meat products. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#115:5>
* Seeds and planting materials. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#116:5>
* Sugar? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#117:5>
Answer: Imports of these commodities are either prohibited or
restricted. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#118:5>
When the supply of these commodities is scarce, the government
may allow their importation, usually by government itself ( rice and corn,
for example) or by users of these products through quotas and licenses. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#119:5>
The rice crisis of last year should have by now exposed the
folly of relying on the government to out-guess the market.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#120:5>
The rice imports came too little and too late.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#121:5>
The same situation is developing in the case of corn, with a
projected shortage of 800,000 tons. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#122:5>
The bureaucrats ' power to allocate economic resources is the
root of graft and corruption.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#123:5>
The yearly ritual of accusations of favoritism, for example,
accompanies the auction of corn imported by the National Food Authority.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#124:5>
The sugar scam is still under investigation, but it has been
established that some well-connected traders and millers made at least P700
million by monkeying around with the export quota system. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#125:5>
The situation is about to change.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#126:5>
The country faces a March 30 deadline to remove the quantitative
restrictions on the imports of these products, except rice, and to replace
these with tariffs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#127:5>
Failure to pass the &ldquo; tariffication &rdquo; measures opens
the country to punitive actions by the member-countries of the World Trade
Organization ( including the country 's three leading trade partners, the
United States, Japan, and the European Union). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#128:5>
We want to gain greater access to their markets, we should grant
them reciprocal access to ours. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#129:5>
Perhaps the country learned a thing or two about market
efficiencies during the debates two years ago on the country 's accession to
the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#130:5>
We do not now hear doomsday prophecies about the death of local
agriculture with import liberalization. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#131:5>
The quantitative restrictions will be replaced by initial
tariffs of 100 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#132:5>
If the Filipino rice farmer can't meet the competition from Thai
rice, which is penalized with 100 percent tariff, he should shift to
<foreign> camote </foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-002#133:5>
He has no business saddling the rest of us with rice that costs
double the world market price. </p> </I>
