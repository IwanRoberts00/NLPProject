Well in my case I never gave him any option <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#187:1:A>
From the very beginning

 <$C>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#188:1:C>
Yes

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#189:1:A>
 <indig> Talaga </indig> 

 <$C>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#190:1:C>
He should know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#191:1:C>
Anyway

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#192:1:A>
Yes

 <$C>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#193:1:C>
Just kidding aside well I thank God that in my case really uhm it was uh <,> not so much love at first sight but he 's really my first boyfriend <{>  <[> and </[> no one else

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#194:1:A>
 <[> Talaga </[>  </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#195:1:A>
But Liway what if one day you find out that he has a mistress
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#196:1:A>
What would you do

 <$C>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#197:1:C>
Well I don't know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#198:1:C>
I 'll kill the mistress probably <&> speaker A laughs </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#199:1:C>
Retain him <O> chuckle </O> no no

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#200:1:A>
No no what what if you find out <{>  <[> that </[> Christian is seeing someone

 <$C>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#201:1:C>
 <[> Uh </[>  </{> 

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#202:1:B>
Well I <.> ha </.> I have a different perspective

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#203:1:A>
What is that perspective

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#204:1:B>
Uh I 'd blame my husband
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#205:1:B>
The mistress is totally irrelevant to me
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#206:1:B>
It 's because it 's our relationship that that is at stake

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#207:1:A>
Whose failure is that most of the time
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#208:1:A>
You mentioned earlier husband fooling around

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#209:1:B>
 <indig> Eh wala na nga siyang </indig> option because I 'm past forty <indig> e <indig>  <&> speaker A laughs </&> 

 <$C>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#210:1:C>
 <indig> Pero </indig> 

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#211:1:A>
Okay Liway

 <$C>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#212:1:C>
 <indig> Kami naman Boy ako naman </indig> I 'm so secure
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#213:1:C>
Uh let 's just say that I have uh really felt so good when we joined <mention> Couples for Christ </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#214:1:C>
Uh

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#215:1:A>
That helped a lot

 <$C>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#216:1:C>
Eleven years ago yes uh and uh that was the time when we were also brought into the marriage uh preparation uh program where we were conducting the uhm pre-Cana
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#217:1:C>
Uh we we took a course on uh uhm <indig> parang </indig> guidance counselors <indig> kami </indig> 

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#218:1:B>
Uhm

 <$C>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#219:1:C>
So we would give seminars in <mention> Mary the Queen  </mention> preparing married couples <{>  <[> uh I mean uh </[> engaged couples to get married

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#220:1:A>
 <[>  <indig> Pero </indig> Liway in uh <indig> oo </indig>  </[>  </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#221:1:A>
In a few in a few lines Liway how does <mention> Couples for Christ  </mention> as an organization help uh married uh couples I mean couples

 <$C>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#222:1:C>
Well first of all we should believe in prayer
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#223:1:C>
We should believe that there is a God who would help couples who are uhm focused on Him
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#224:1:C>
And uh because of this if <,> it has an uh first of all an effect on on your relationship <&> speaker A coughs </&> I don't know what happened but we have been more open communicating with each other and uh more than being open communicating with each other it 's as if we have become uh more romantic <{>  <[> more </[> 

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#225:1:A>
 <[> I will </[>  </{> debate that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#226:1:A>
That 's you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#227:1:A>
But what about couples who 've tried everything but things just wouldn't work out

 <$C>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#228:1:C>
Because they are not uh surrendered to the Lord
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#229:1:C>
That 's what I would say <{>  <[> and because </[> from the very beginning they did not find the probably the love that would strengthen their relationship

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#230:1:A>
 <[> Uh-huh </[>  </{> 

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#231:1:B>
They did not pray for passion <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#232:1:A>
Well we talked about <O> laughter </O> husbands fooling around
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#233:1:A>
My question is this what if somebody comes to you goes to you and says and offers a proposal proposes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#234:1:A>
And what if you discover one day that you have a child who is gay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#235:1:A>
What would you do
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#236:1:A>
But before you talk about being gay and uh indecent proposals you are part of this private conversation we 're having with <indig> Mareng </indig> Winnie and Liway Chato
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-029#237:1:A>
Stay with us
