<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#3:1>
Congressmen tightened the noose yesterday on beleaguered Quezon
Rep. <@> Jesus Jimenez </@> by asking the chamber 's ethics committee to look
into his possible violation of the rule against conflict of interest. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#4:1>
They made the appeal after learning about the case of Metrobank,
which <@> Jimenez </@> , who chairs the powerful House ways and means
committee, wanted investigated for alleged non-payment of &peso;3 billion in
documentary tax. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#5:1>
They also learned about the Quezon congressman 's airport deals,
and his initiatives to have airport authorities investigated for alleged
irregularities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#6:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The ethics committee should look into <@> Jimenez
</@> 's initiative to inquire into Metrobank which, to me, is a clear case of
conflict of interest, &rdquo; </quote> a member of the ways and means
committee told reporters yesterday. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#7:1>
<@> Jimenez </@> , who belongs to President Estrada 's <indig>
Laban ng Masang Pilipino </indig> ( LAMP), had filed Resolution 519 asking
his own committee to inquire into the bank 's supposed tax liability. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#8:1>
Two vice chairmen of the <@> Jimenez </@> panel revealed last
Wednesday that their chairman had told them that he sought the inquiry on
Metrobank because he wanted to exact vengeance on bank chairman George Ty.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#9:1>
The two said <@> Jimenez </@> had told them that Ty 's bank
foreclosed in 1984 on his Forbes Park house and lot, which he had mortgaged,
because he defaulted on his payments. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#10:1>
Interviewed over radio station <it> DZMM </it> yesterday, the
Quezon solon confirmed that he had indeed mortgaged his house and lot with
Metrobank with a &peso;2.5-million loan and that the bank had seized his
property.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#11:1>
He denied that he was singling out Ty 's bank, though, saying the
non-payment by banks of documentary stamps tax for certain transactions was
an industry-wide problem. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#12:1>
His resolution 519, however, singles out Metrobank, one of the
largest banks in the country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#13:1>
He told <it> DZMM </it> that the inquiry has to begin with the
largest banks, but that other banks will have to be investigated as well.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#14:1>
He did not comment on his two vice chairmen 's claims that he
wanted to take revenge on Ty. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#15:1>
The Tys now reportedly occupy his Forbes Park house which sits on
a huge lot.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#16:1>
<@> Jimenez </@> himself resides in the exclusive Makati village, on
<@> 666 Hyacinth Ave. </@> , North Forbes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#17:1>
Members of the ways and means committee have decided to stop
their inquiry on Metrobank and on <foreign> La Suerte </foreign> Cigar and
Cigarette Co., which was the object of another <@> Jimenez </@> investigation
initiative, because they felt their investigation was based on flimsy
grounds. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#18:1>
They said they did not want to be accused of harassment or
shakedown. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#19:1>
Internal Revenue Commissioner Beethoven Rualo had told them that
his agency had no conclusive findings on the supposed tax liabilities of
Metrobank and <foreign> La Suerte </foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#20:1>
On his alleged airports deals, <@> Jimenez </@> 's colleagues
learned that Inter-Asia, a company reportedly owned by the solon and his
family, holds the contract for the three parking lots at the Ninoy Aquino
International Airport ( NAIA). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#21:1>
Airport sources said Inter-Asia makes at least &peso;50,000 a day
in clear profit from the parking lots. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#22:1>
Besides the parking lots, <@> Jimenez </@> operates the <indig>
<@> Lahing Filipino </@> </indig> restaurant at NAIA. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#23:1>
Despite his airport business, the Quezon solon continues to seek
House inquiries into alleged irregularities at the premier airport. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#24:1>
Last July 27, he filed Resolution 74 asking the appropriate
committee to look into the performance of the winning bidder in the
construction of NAIA Terminal II. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#25:1>
Two weeks later, on Aug. 13, he introduced another resolution,
number 181, proposing another inquiry into the conduct of the bidding and the
awarding of a contract to a single corporation to exclusively run the
concession areas at NAIA Terminal II. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#26:1>
Sources said Inter-Asia could be eyeing some concession areas at
the second terminal. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#27:1>
During the last Congress, the airport was also the object of
investigation proposals contained in several resolutions introduced by <@>
Jimenez </@> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#28:1>
Other resolutions filed by <@> Jimenez </@> had to do with the
awarding by government agencies of contracts for the procurement of
navigational aids or radar systems. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#29:1>
It is common knowledge that <@> Jimenez </@> owns or represents
companies which supply navigational equipment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#30:1>
Other resolutions filed by <@> Jimenez </@> during the last
Congress:

<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#31:1>
* Resolution 80 asking the committee on transportation and
communications to investigate the GEC-Marconi radar project of the Department
of Transportation and Communications.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#32:1>
* Resolution 92 requesting the committee on transportation and
communications to inquire into the short-listing of prospective bidders for
new domestic airport terminal at the NAIA complex.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#33:1>
* Resolution 232 directing the committee on energy to recommend that
the National Power Corp. adopt the lowest bid price of &dollar;1.4 billion
submitted by Consolidated Electric Power Asia as the approved agency estimate
if a rebidding of the 1,200-megawatt natural gas power plant in Batangas is
conducted.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#34:1>
* Resolution 452 asking the appropriate committee to look into the
propriety and legality of Napocor 's decision to install a fiber-optic
telecommunications system using its present power transmission facilities.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#35:1>
* Resolution 453 seeking an inquiry into the award by the Manila
International Airport Authority of a &peso;492.66-million contract to
Serco-ial, a British company, for the installation of an integrated security
system at NAIA.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#36:1>
Resolution 446 directing the proper committee to investigate the
hiring by Napocor of Merill-Lynch as its consultant on its privatization
projects.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#37:1>
* Resolution 538 seeking an inquiry into the awarding of rights to
construct NAIA III to Asia 's Emerging Dragon Corp. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#38:1>
At one hearing during the last Congress, <@> Jimenez </@> had a
heated verbal exchange with then Chairman Richard Gordon of the Subic Bay
Metropolitan Authority, who was summoned to a House hearing on the purchase
by SBMA of navigational aids. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#39:1>
Gordon questioned the propriety of <@> Jimenez </@> 's
participation in the hearing, revealing that the solon had offered to supply
SBMA with the navigational equipment it needed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#40:1>
<@> Jimenez </@> told <it> DZMM </it> yesterday that he
questioned Gordon 's purchase because SBMA ignored a bid submitted by an
American firm, which offered a price lower by &dollar;5 million than the
offer of Alcatel, the winning bidder. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#41:1>
He said the navigational aid supplied by Alcatel is defective
until now. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#42:1>
SBMA Chairman Felicito Payumo, reached by <mention> The STAR
</mention> , confirmed that the Alcatel equipment is not operational. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#43:1>
<@> Jimenez </@> 's colleagues in the ways and means committee
said these are but a few conflict of interest cases committed by their
chairman. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#44:1>
House leaders said it would be difficult for the ethics committee
probe on <@> Jimenez </@> to prosper if it focuses only on the reports that
the Quezon solon has used President Estrada 's name and demanded advance
kickbacks from potential weapons and radar systems suppliers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#45:1>
Assistant Majority Leader Neptali Gonzales II said the committee
has to comply with the requirements of due process. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#46:1>
<quote> &ldquo; This means that it will have to gather evidence
and hear witnesses.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#47:1>
I don't think anyone, including my complaining colleagues, will come
out to testify against Congressman <@> Jimenez </@> , &rdquo; </quote> he
said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#48:1>
Another House leader said it would perhaps be easier to
investigate and eventually punish <@> Jimenez </@> , if the evidence
warrants, on the issue of conflict of interest. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> US-China clash over Spratlys seen </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#50:2>
<bold> Jess Diaz </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#51:2>
The United States expects a confrontation with China over Chinese
expansionism in the South China Sea, including its occupation of the disputed
Spratlys, Rep. Roilo Golez ( LAMP, Para&ntilde;aque) said yesterday. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#52:2>
He said documents and information shared with him by US Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher ( Republican, California) and the American lawmaker 's staff
indicate that the US <quote> &ldquo; expects a showdown with China over the
South China Sea issue within 15 years or less. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#53:2>
He said one document given to him is a recent report to the
American Congress by US Defense Secretary William Cohen which assesses China 's
military preparations, particularly in its southern flank. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#54:2>
Golez quoted the report: <quote> &ldquo; Since the early 1990s,
the focus of Chinese military strategy has been preparing for potential
military contingencies along China 's south-eastern flank, especially in the
Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#55:2>
Thus, China 's goal is to field forces capable of rapidly deploying
to fight and win a future regional war under high technology conditions along
China 's periphery. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#56:2>
Golez cited another report by Director Richard Fisher of the
Asian Studies Center of the Heritage Foundation, a US think tank, which noted
that China has developed a 16-kilometer range TV-guided anti-ship missile
that can be fired from its Z-9 helicopters. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#57:2>
<quote> &ldquo; From small platforms in the disputed Spratly
islands, Z-9s equipped with these missiles would pose a greater threat to
other claimants and to contiguous international shipping lanes, &rdquo;
</quote> he quoted Fisher 's report as saying. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#58:2>
He said the structures he, Rohrabacher and a big group of
Filipino media men saw when they flew over the Spratlys last Thursday can
serve as launching platforms for helicopters and missiles. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#59:2>
Assessing what the Chinese have been doing in the disputed
islands, Golez, a graduate of the United States Naval Academy and a former
Philippine Navy officer, revealed that China is apparently building a small
naval base on Mischief Reef and nearby shoals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#60:2>
<quote> &ldquo; They are constructing a circle of huge, concrete,
hardened structures with radars, guns and helipads and making a mini-navy
base, &rdquo; </quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#61:2>
He said what they saw last Thursday belies the assurance given to
the Philippine government by the Chinese ambassador to Manila that China is
just repairing shelters for its fishermen and that there are no naval ships
in the area. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#62:2>
Photographs and film footage taken by the Golez and Rohrabacher
group showed that there are three Chinese warships anchored at a deep lagoon
near Mischief reef. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#63:2>
Golez said the Rohrabacher visit was a <quote> &ldquo; diplomatic
breakthrough &rdquo; </quote> that elicited only a <quote> &ldquo; very mild,
even timid response &rdquo; </quote> from China, compared with the loud
protest it made when a similar Filipino media group planned to fly over the
disputed islands during the Ramos administration. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#64:2>
Perhaps, this is because the visiting official comes from a super
power like the US, he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#65:2>
He said through the Rohrabacher visit, the Philippines was able
to bring international attention to <quote> &ldquo; Chinese incursions and
bullying &rdquo; </quote> in the Spratlys. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#66:2>
He added that the American lawmaker, who is a member of the House
international affairs committee, will submit a report next week on what he
saw in the disputed islands. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#67:2>
<quote> &ldquo; He promised that he will be our point man in the
US Congress in our effort to make international noise and make this an
international issue to let the world know how a giant power like China is
bullying a weak, small country like the Philippines, which is simply
protecting its exclusive economic zone, &rdquo; </quote> Golez stressed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#68:2>
He announced plans to visit the US Congress early next week to
brief other American lawmakers on the situation in the Spratlys. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#69:2>
<quote> &ldquo; This is part of the noise barrage that can be our
best defense weapon," </quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#70:2>
He said the dispute over the Spratlys cannot be settled in
bilateral negotiations <quote> &ldquo; because the Chinese will just stare us
down, bludgeon us with their weight, and continue and continue doing what
they have been doing. &rdquo; </quote> </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Noynoy: My dad used RP passport </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#72:3>
<bold> Jose Rodel Clapano </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#73:3>
Tarlac Rep. Benigno &ldquo; Noynoy &rdquo; Aquino III denied
claims yesterday by former First Lady Imelda Marcos that his late father and
namesake was carrying a US passport when he returned to the country in 1983.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#74:3>
The young Aquino said that Mrs. Marcos was merely raising the
possibility of US involvement in his father 's return as a ploy to divert
attention from her own possible involvement in the former senator 's
assassination in August that year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#75:3>
He said the former first lady was also trying to discredit his
father. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#76:3>
<quote> &ldquo; My father could not ( have gotten) the support of
the US government because he had been suspected as a potential terrorist when
he went to the US, &rdquo; </quote> Aquino said, adding his namesake was even
investigated because of his alleged links to Philippine communist rebels.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#77:3>
He dismissed the allegations of Mrs. Marcos, saying she was
desperately trying to spare the Marcoses from blame for the death of the
opposition leader, who was assassinated upon his return to the Philippines on
Aug. 21, 1983. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#78:3>
<quote> &ldquo; Imelda is very difficult to understand and hard
to follow, &rdquo; </quote> Aquino told <mention> <bold> The STAR </bold>
</mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#79:3>
Aquino said that his father - - who began his US exile in 1980 in
Dallas, Texas after being allowed by the Marcos administration to undergo
heart surgery - - had two Philippine passports prior to his return to the
country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#80:3>
<quote> &ldquo; One was expired and the other was provided by one
of the people sympathetic to my father, &rdquo; </quote> Aquino said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#81:3>
He noted that the Philippine passport provided to Ninoy by one of
his <quote> <quote> &ldquo; sympathizers &rdquo; </quote> was a <quote>
&ldquo; blank passport. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#82:3>
<quote> &ldquo; The man who provided the blank passport to my
father was . ...one who had the capacity to issue a Philippine passport,
&rdquo; </quote> said Aquino, who declined to reveal the identity of the man
<quote> &ldquo; because his life might be placed in danger. &rdquo; </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#83:3>
During Ninoy Aquino 's three-year stay in the US from 1980 to
1983, Noynoy said that his father did not seek permanent residency status nor
did he apply as an immigrant to the US. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#84:3>
<quote> &ldquo; He merely renewed his permit to stay in the US
every six months at the Immigration and Naturalization Service, &rdquo;
</quote> said the solon, adding that at that time the senator was conducting
a study on how to return the Philippines to democracy after years of
dictatorial rule. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#85:3>
The other day, Mrs. Marcos questioned the whereabouts of Ninoy
Aquino 's passport which he used during his fatal return home. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#86:3>
<quote> &ldquo; Where is that passport now? &rdquo; </quote> she
asked, noting that the passport failed to turn up in previous investigations
of the murder. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-003#87:3>
She claimed that even <mention> <it> Time </it> </mention>
magazine Asia bureau chief Sandra Burton testified that the senator was
carrying a US passport, bolstering her earlier statements that the US had a
hand in the events leading to his homecoming. </p> </I>
