<&> missing words </&> protesting the practices of their parish priest Fr Aricio Dormido and petitioning for Fr Ayubo 's retention as assistant parish priest
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-019#2:1:A>
The parishioners said Dormido is anti-poor and has caused disunity among the followers of the church
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-019#3:1:A>
However Dormido calmly said that the protestors should be forgiven for they do not know what they are doing <O> news clip </O>

On the other hand Bacolod Bishop Camilo Gregorio explained the issue at the parish of Victorias is an internal affair and that media pressure will not resolve a church problem

But the Bishop decided to let Fr Dormido stay in his post

Due to the arising problem of the labor sectors in the country particularly in the Cordillera region members of the said sector are planning to initiate a boycott as the regional tripartite wages and productivity board tackles next year the issue regarding salary increases

This report

<ICE-PHI:S2B-019#58:1:F>
All members of the labor sector nationwide will stage a boycott next year regarding the regional tripartite wages and productivity board 's dialogues on salary increase
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-019#59:1:F>
According to the officials of the Association of Labor Union Trade Union Congress of the Philippines Cordillera chapter they are already in the process of finalizing their position for a representation in the R T W P B worldwide
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-019#60:1:F>
Their position they say is the result of the unfair treatment of the R T W P B in increasing the <w> workers' </w> wages
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-019#61:1:F>
It was learned that this unjustifiable wage increase all came from the said board without consulting the workers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-019#62:1:F>
Aside from releasing contradicting data as that of the government sector members of the A L U T U C P claimed that the wage board neglects the responsibilities such as responding to all the demands of the labor sector
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-019#63:1:F>
They said the D T I and NEDA should first study the needs of the laborers before issuing data to the technical working group of the wage board so as to avoid confusion
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-019#64:1:F>
A L U T U C P stressed that the laxity of the wage board only proves that workers are not being given due process of law
