<h> <bold> ABSTRACT </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#4:1>
Indigenous yams of various species and cultivars abounding in the
Northern Philippines are generally important as subsistence and cash crops.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#5:1>
Normally, yams are harvested at about 75% to 100% senescence depending
on its use and are handled manually with high postharvest losses.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#6:1>
Villagers have unique ways of utilizing these yams into food.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#7:1>
Each specie or cultivar has its own particular eating characteristics
that influence village users ' acceptance.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#8:1>
The postproduction practices and problems are then described
individually. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#9:1>
Unedible yams in their fresh tuber state like <mention> &ldquo;
nami &rdquo; </mention> ( <it> <foreign> Dioscorea hispida Dennst </foreign>
</it> ) are processed indigenously to be edible.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#10:1>
These are done either by brine soaking and washing at varied number
of days, roasting, adding vine extracts or alcoholic drink, or by using
&ldquo; mother &rdquo; solution.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#11:1>
A follow up study on these methods was done to evaluate their safety
in the preparation for food and is reported separately.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#12:1>
To few people, processing fresh <foreign> nami </foreign> tubers is
also favored to clean rough hands and feet incurred from hard field work
making them smooth.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#13:1>
Roasted <foreign> &ldquo; nami, &rdquo; </foreign> on the other hand,
is used to bait crabs ( crustacean) for food from the riverbanks. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#14:1>
<h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#15:1>
Various crops as source of food nutrients are available in the
Philippines and these include root crops.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#16:1>
Root crops played a historic role as food and some have now gained
international recognition.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#17:1>
Among these are potatoes, sweet potatoes, and cassava.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#18:1>
Left behind as minor root crops categorized as low priority
commodities ( PCARRD, 1992) are yams, aroids, yambeans, arrowroot and other
edible root crops mainly because of their low production volume and
contribution to the national economy ( Villanueva, 1994).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#19:1>
These crops, however, are importantly utilized in most villages where
economic growth is slow.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#20:1>
The slow development of these crops could be due to several factors
such as their physical and physiological characteristics as well as
traditional farming method, limited utilization technologies, knowledge about
the nature or properties of these crops that need to be further explored, and
lack of government resources to put up facilities needed in the development
of the crop. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#21:1>
Yam are mainly recognized as carbohydrate-producing crops ( Miege
and Lyonga, 1982; Pido and Pepino, 1987); eaten as staple ( Nakagawa, 1970)
important cash crop ( Gayao and Ganga, 1994); or supplement to rice (
Lacaden, 1993).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#22:1>
They are also used as ingredient or flavoring to special delicacies
and ice cream making ( Giron, 1994).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#23:1>
Demand for yams, in fact, is rapidly increasing because of the
changing eating pattern of the modern society but supply for preferred
varieties with purple flesh and good processing qualities is limited (
Villanueva, 1994).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#24:1>
Only the <mention> &ldquo; Kinampay &rdquo; variety </mention> , as
called in the southern Philippines or <mention> &ldquo; Sampero &rdquo;
</mention> in the northern part is appreciated by yam processors to have the
best quality but yield is low and is highly susceptible to pests and diseases
( Mariscal, 1994;).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#25:1>
White yams, though of higher yield than purple ones ( Bartolini and
Gundaya, 1994), still have no commercial demand yet ( Villanueva, 1994).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#26:1>
On the other hand, the toxic properties ( i. e. diosgenin,
dioscorine) of some wild species are extracted for pharmaceutical and poison
uses ( Onwueme, 1981). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#27:1>
Several studies were done on yams which include varietal
collection, yield evaluation, cultural management, postproduction, and some
on the nutritional compositions and starch properties ( Data <foreign> et al.
</foreign> , 1988).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#28:1>
But studies on the knowledge of village users ' point of view are
still lacking.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#29:1>
According to Salazar ( 1994), the resources flourish with the help of
farmers who under specific agronomic and socio-economic conditions have been
improving on such resources through careful process of collection, selection,
and cultivation for some couple of years.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#30:1>
Gathering information then on-site from the villagers/end users and
evaluating their techniques could help or give researchers &ldquo; clue
&rdquo; in developing varieties or products that are needed in this
sophisticated world.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#31:1>
This concept could be supported by Prain and Bagalanon 's ( 1994)
report on local knowledge and global science, that <quote> &ldquo; though
many species and varieties were discovered and well known in the official
history, still this powerless nature of knowledge has made it invisible to
global science or claimed to be unsystematic and incapable of meeting the
productivity needs of the modern world mainly because many of the small-scale
marginal agricultural systems where local genetic diversity is high and
resources experimentation is common, has been little touched by the successes
of the Green Revolution. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#32:1>
The authors stressed then the need to overcome isolation and identify
complementarities if global agricultural science is to benefit marginal
farming households. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#33:1>
The aim of this study then was to identify existing yams, their
characteristics, the places where they are found and importantly gather
indigenous knowledge on the postharvest handling and utilization of these
yams.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#34:1>
It is hoped that this simple endeavor would be useful to researchers
and other people interested on indigenous yams to work more on the
development of these potential crops. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#35:1>
<h> <bold> METHODOLOGY </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#36:1>
The areas where the survey was conducted included provinces
covered by the three regions in the Northern Philippines, namely: Abra,
Benguet, Ifugao, and Mountain Province of the Cordillera Administration
Region ( CAR); Ilocos Sur, La Union and Pangasinan of Region I; and Nueva
Vizcaya of Region II.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#37:1>
Identification of municipalities and barangays growing yam was based
on various secondary sources, notably the Department of Agriculture and
Bureau of Statistics.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#38:1>
Historical background of the yams were traced by asking the market
vendors the source of their supply. </p> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#39:1>
A set of guide topics/questions that focused on documenting farmers '
yam cultivars and their postproduction techniques as well as problems was
used.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#40:1>
A total of 107 respondents involved in yams were interviewed:
classified as farmers, wholesalers, retails, processors, consumers, observers
or combinations of these. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#41:1>
The survey included the cultivated and wild yams utilized as
food, animal feeds and other purposes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#42:1>
Other information from observers who volunteered during the interview
were also documented.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#43:1>
The survey started in December 1990 and was completed in December
1992. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#44:1>
<h> <bold> RESULTS AND DISCUSSION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#45:1>
<h> <bold> Indigenous yams included in the study. </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#46:1>
The existing cultivated and wild yams as well as the places where
they are found are shown in Table 1.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#47:1>
Their local names are retained for purposes of further
characterization later.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#48:1>
They, however, showed varied plant and tuber characteristics ( Table
2) but same may be of the same species or cultivar suspected to be
acclimatized to the environment where it was grown.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#49:1>
The basis of classification here was based on the descriptions of
yams described by Onwueme ( 1981); Messiaen ( 1988); Miege and Lyonga (
1982); Burkill ( 1960) and Purseglove ( 1968).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#50:1>
Some characteristics which these yams have, however, were not
observed because visitation was done after harvest where the plants have
dried up already making it difficult to identify.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#51:1>
Moreover, villagers gave different names based on their local
language, either through tuber shape, color, or place where they came from.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#52:1>
It is therefore recommended to make a complete collection and
characterize them accordingly using improved techniques such as isozyme
analysis. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#53:1>
<h> <bold> CULTIVATED VARIETIES </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#54:1>
<h> <bold> Local varieties. </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#55:1>
Yams are grown mostly on marginal lands either as monocrop, intercrop
or mix crop to legumes, corn, upland rice, other root crops or ginger.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#56:1>
This system of multiple cropping is practiced by most farmers for
various food supply.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#57:1>
Due to unstable market prices, farmers take risks by planting
different kinds of crops to backup / compensate for low income return
obtained in other crops.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#58:1>
Yams are grown on poles, under trees or tall shrubs.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#59:1>
The varieties mostly cultivated belong to the species of <it>
<foreign> Dioscorea alata </foreign> </it> ( otherwise known as <mention>
<indig> ubi </indig> </mention> ; greater yam) and <it> <foreign> Dioscorea
esculenta </foreign> </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#60:1>
Among these are <mention> &ldquo; <indig> Sampero </indig> , &rdquo;
</mention> <mention> &ldquo; <indig> Shiket </indig> , &rdquo; </mention>
<mention> &ldquo; <indig> Padikot </indig> , &rdquo; </mention> <mention>
&ldquo; <indig> Padinse </indig> , &rdquo; </mention> <mention> &ldquo;
<indig> Daking </indig> , &rdquo; </mention> and <mention> &ldquo; <indig>
Tongkol </indig> &ldquo; </mention> for the <it> <foreign> D. alata
</foreign> </it> group and <mention> &ldquo; <indig> Ilocano </indig> ,
&rdquo; </mention> <mention> &ldquo; <indig> Diket </indig> &ldquo;
</mention> and <mention> &ldquo; Native <indig> Tugue </indig> &ldquo;
</mention> for <it> <foreign> D. esculenta </foreign> </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#61:1>
&ldquo; <indig> Sampero </indig> &ldquo; is the most preferred
variety because of its high market demand but claimed by farmers to be highly
susceptible to disease and needs extra care and maintenance.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#62:1>
This variety has a round tuber shape, deep purple flesh, and strong
aroma preferred by processors; a set of characteristics similar to the
&ldquo; <indig> Kinampay </indig> &ldquo; variety on the Southern part of
Philippines ( Villanueva, 1994).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#63:1>
Other varieties mentioned above also have purple flesh and are used
to supplement the low supply of &ldquo; <indig> Sampero </indig> &ldquo; but
are less desirable due to poor aroma and tuber shapes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#64:1>
The growing areas of yams are mostly in warmer areas of Benguet
Province; nearby boundaries like La Union, Pangasinan, in Dupax del Norte and
Kasibu of Nueva Vizcaya province. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#65:1>
For <it> <foreign> Dioscorea esculenta </foreign> </it> , common
varieties found in most of the areas visited are the <mention> &ldquo;
<indig> Ilocano </indig> &ldquo; </mention> and <mention> &ldquo; <indig>
Diket </indig> &ldquo; </mention> varieties.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#66:1>
The biggest volume of &ldquo; <indig> Tugue </indig> &ldquo;
production, however, are obtained in Abra province of the CAR region; La
Union, Pangasinan, and Ilocos Sur provinces of Region I.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#67:1>
The <mention> &ldquo; Native &rdquo; type </mention> is an additional
variety found only in some parts of Benguet and nearby La Union.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#68:1>
The two former varieties are cylindrically elongated with white to
yellow skin and flesh while the latter is somewhat round to round oval shape,
brownish skin and white flesh. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#69:1>
Although yams grow in most of the areas, certain types of species
and cultivars predominate in a particular area.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#70:1>
These species usually carried large number of local names or may be
different varieties carrying the same names.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#71:1>
Thus, a confusion in collecting information on the particular types
of yams.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#72:1>
Work on collection, identification and characterization of these
different species and cultivars will be done to resolve this confusion and
may further include yams from other places in the Philippines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#73:1>
<h> <bold> Harvesting practices. </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#74:1>
Harvesting depends on the needs of the farmers whether the tubers are
for sale, home consumption or planting material.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#75:1>
Usually, harvesting is done at 7 to 12 months ( November to March)
maturity.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#76:1>
Harvesting is based on the calendar method, yield sampling or
senescence ( yellowing) of the plant.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#77:1>
For cash crop, yams are harvested when leaves are 75 to 85% senescent
and for food, harvesting, could be done the same or later.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#78:1>
Sometimes, farmers sample the plants by carefully digging a few hills
and see if the size is big enough and pinch the skin to determine the texture
of the flesh.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#79:1>
They claimed that immature tubers are usually watery with loose
starch grains.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#80:1>
As planting material, farmers usually wait for the vines to dry up
for the tubers to fully mature.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#81:1>
Tubers store long when harvested at full maturity and believed to
produce higher yield when planted than immature ones. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#82:1>
Harvesting is usually done on staggered basis, harvesting a
volume that could be eaten or disposed in a short period of time.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#83:1>
In the lowlands where &ldquo; <indig> Tugue </indig> &ldquo; are
planted in rice farms, harvesting is done on a row basis using a plow drawn
by animals.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#84:1>
In the remote areas in Kapangan, Benguet, some farmers prime big
tubers and leave the small ones to grow with the mother plant.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#85:1>
However, when the production area is to be followed or prepared for
the next cropping, total harvesting is done. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#86:1>
Delayed harvesting is also practiced to wait for higher market
price.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#87:1>
Generally, prices go up during special occasions such as Christmas,
Chinese New Year, and Holy Week seasons.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#88:1>
One or two weeks before these occasions, tubers are dug and brought
to the market. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#89:1>
Aerial tubers that falls on ground ( formed on the axils of some
yam vine plants) are replanted back nearby the dug area for the next harvest
season. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#90:1>
<h> <bold> Handling practices. </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#91:1>
Containers used for collecting and hauling are &ldquo; <indig> lagba
</indig> &ldquo; ( rattan-woven basket used in the lowlands, about 1 foot
high and 2 feet wide), polypropylene sacks, and &ldquo; <indig> kayabang
</indig> &ldquo; ( field container used in Benguet carried at the back
supported with a head band).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#92:1>
Handling practices depend on the places where yams are found or
grown.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#93:1>
Farmers with access to good roads haul the produce from farm to
roadside and may dispose them there to wholesalers or bring then to the
nearest possible market for higher price.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#94:1>
These are transported by private vehicles or public transport for
distribution to neighboring places.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#95:1>
In most cases, these are handled together with other crops.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#96:1>
Farmers in far-flung areas have to back-carry the produce for
marketing or may use them for home consumption. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#97:1>
<h> <bold> Storage practices. </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#98:1>
Due to limited produce and storage facilities, storing yam tubers for
longer period is not common to farmers.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#99:1>
It is practiced by few processors who purchase big volumes with
enough space for storage.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#100:1>
Tubers are usually purchased from December to March and are stored
in shelves or piled on floors.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#101:1>
Storage period depends on the processing schedule which takes weeks
or months to process a certain volume of tubers.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#102:1>
High decay incidence during storage is one problem processors
claimed contributing to losses, and this needs immediate attention.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#103:1>
The possible reason for this high decay incidence could be traced to
the harvesting methods employed by farmers where yams are harvested early,
about 75 to 85% senescence and the rough handling of yams from farm to
roadside to the market causing severe skinning and injuries to tubers.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#104:1>
Moreover, containers such as polypropylene sacks are not firm and
strong to protect tubers from injuries during handling.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#105:1>
Decay ( Onwueme, 1981) is caused by the effects of fungi and
bacteria which could have entered through wounds.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#106:1>
It is suggested then that adequate protection should be ensured
throughout the distribution period to minimize crop loss. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#107:1>
For food, tubers are just placed in any corner of the kitchen
and cooked as needed.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#108:1>
Storing tubers may last for 1 to 2 weeks or more, often done to
sweeten them.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#109:1>
Sweetened tubers have softer texture and good eating characteristics
when cooked.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#110:1>
Sugars actually are present in fresh yam tubers in small quantity (
Onwueme, 1981) and increases during or just before sprouting due to the
conversion of starch to sugar.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#111:1>
Leftover tubers for planting material are kept for about 1 to 3
months depending on the availability of production area.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#112:1>
These are usually small sizes, or cut head portions of yam tubers
left aside for planting.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-033#113:1>
These cut portions are left for sometime at ambient condition to
cure wounds naturally. </p> </I>
