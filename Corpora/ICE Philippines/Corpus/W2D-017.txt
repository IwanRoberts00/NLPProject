<h> <bold> Art of buying a Turkish carpet </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#3:1>
<bold> ISTANBUL </bold> - -

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#4:1>
Buying a Turkish carpet is like choosing a marriage partner.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#5:1>
You take one for life so it 's important to choose well.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#6:1>
And as you and your carpet grow old together, the handcrafted artwork
will develop a special luster that upstart, brand new and possibly - - horror
of horrors! - - machine-made carpets can never equal. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#7:1>
A real Turkish carpet <foreign> connoisseur </foreign> has no
interest in new carpets straight from the weaving looms in an Anatolyan
mountain village last week - - unless he wishes to gift his just-born
grandson with a legacy that will only realize its true value by the time the
grandson is ready to become a grandfather. </p>

<p> <quote> &ldquo; Only the tourist and the <foreign> <it> nouveau riche
</it> </foreign> look at new carpets, &rdquo; </quote> says one such
<foreign> connoisseur </foreign> named Berti, who runs a water pipe shop in
Istanbul, rather condescendingly.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#8:1>
<quote> &ldquo; They don't know any better. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#9:1>
Berti 's passions are the antique - - the older, the better - -
carpets that lost generations of mothers and aunts once patiently wove on
their living room floors to alleviate boredom during long winters.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#10:1>
These carpets ' intricate patterns can never be exactly woven again
because the contemporary Turkish village woman 's patience for manual work
has run thin.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#11:1>
Television, radio, and even satellite programming beckon, as well as
the lures of big city life. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#12:1>
<h> <bold> Proof of skills </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#13:1>
These days, a 5 x 5-knot wool and cotton <foreign> <it> Kayseri
</it> </foreign> ( named after a weaving region in Central Turkey) carpet is
a proof of skill, while the 6 x 6-knot carpets of yesteryears is considered
martyrdom. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#14:1>
<quote> &ldquo; They don't make carpets like these anymore,
&rdquo; </quote> says Achmed, who is Berti 's cousin and a fourth generation
carpet dealer, as he spreads a 50-year old floor rug woven in the designs of
the royal Topkapi Palace on the floor of his tiny stall adjacent to Istanbul 's
Covered Bazaar. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#15:1>
Antique carpets are also purchased as investments by shrewd art
collectors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#16:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Knots as tightly woven as these are things of the
past, which is why we can sell old ones at a premium, &rdquo; </quote>
continues Achmed.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#17:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I guess the trend will continue, too, and it will
become more and more difficult and expensive to handweave.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#18:1>
If you buy a good handwoven carpet from me now, for instance, I will
probably buy it back at double the price in ten years. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#19:1>
<h> <bold> Family heirlooms </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#20:1>
For most carpet lovers, however, Turkish carpets are simply
family heirlooms awarded a prominent place in the living room, where guests
can admire the design in its entirety and the handwork in detail.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#21:1>
The more it is used in daily life, the shinier the wool, the more
vivid the colors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#22:1>
The child 's muddy footprints, <foreign> shish kebab </foreign>
sauce spills, and overturned cups of apple tea have all become part of the
carpet - - adding character and family stories to a once lifeless piece. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#23:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I have no treasures to speak of, &rdquo; </quote>
says Mehti, owner of a small hotel in the tourist town of Urgup in Central
Turkey, <quote> &ldquo; except for my carpets, which have been with us for
generations and are priceless. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#24:1>
And indeed, his family 's collection of over 300 old Turkish carpets
color the walls and floors of his otherwise nondescript hotel in the midst of
a dusty plain. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#25:1>
While the joys of owning a fine Turkish carpet are universally
acknowledged, however, the pleasures of the all-important search have yet to
be properly revealed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#26:1>
Such an acquisition merits more than a perfunctory visit to the
nearest carpet store or a harassed decision during the only free afternoon on
a package tour.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#27:1>
The search takes time and should be enjoyed at leisure, if only for
the momentary illusions it provides of a past era. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#28:1>
<h> <bold> Carpet search </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#29:1>
Serious carpet enthusiasts must begin their search with
non-committal visits to the typical tourist carpet haunts in downtown
Istanbul where the products are mediocre and the prices extravagant.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#30:1>
Over refills of strong local coffee and apple tea, shopkeepers will
cheerfully provide adequate crash courses on spotting good carpets and
industry lingo - - information necessary for the second stage of the search.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#31:1>
When one has acquired enough information to confidently spot a
wool-on-wool carpet and tell the difference between a <mention> Kayseri
</mention> and a <mention> Herieke </mention> , then one is probably ready
for the actual purchase. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#32:1>
<foreign> Connoisseurs </foreign> maintain that the best carpet
finds at still reasonable prices await clients at the various weaving regions
around the country, away from Istanbul 's tourist traps. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#33:1>
The semi-government cooperative Oz-Ay Carpet, Tourism, Industry &
Trade Co., Inc. in the Capaddocia region, is one such center.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#34:1>
Reaching it is no easy feat, requiring an hour 's flight from
Istanbul to the city of Kayseri and then a two-and-a-half drive through the
mountains to Urgup town. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#35:1>
<h> <bold> Queen of carpets </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#36:1>
At the cooperative, carpets are housed in special buildings
according to categories: 100% wool, wool-woven-on-cotton frames, and 100%
silk.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#37:1>
The 100% silk Herieke carpets, lusted after by <foreign> connoisseurs
</foreign> as the queen of all Turkish carpets, are kept in a small,
dimly-lit room imbued with a mysterious aroma. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#38:1>
Upon arrival, the client is made to sit in the place of honor in
a cavernous room filled from ceiling to ceiling with carpets.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#39:1>
The selection session begins with wine and local appetizers while the
carpet master discourses on the region, the cooperative and Turkish carpets.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#40:1>
Once the client 's preferences have been determined, assistants
begin coming out from the sidelines and rapidly unfurling dozens of carpets
before the astonished client while the master churns out a little story on
each.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#41:1>
The effect is pure magic.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#42:1>
The client is breathless in a sea of tales, colors and designs,
compelled to purchase as many as the credit card can accommodate. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#43:1>
The initial screening takes place effortlessly, although the
final decision may take a long time.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#44:1>
The client is subtly wooed with more wine and less talk, as the staff
respectfully maintain their distance and silence.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#45:1>
This is, after all, a place for <foreign> connoisseurs </foreign>
rather than souvenir-hunting tourists so pressure-selling is avoided.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#46:1>
The <foreign> connoisseur </foreign> , after all, knows the carpet 's
value and needs no encouragement to appreciate. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#47:1>
<h> <bold> Final negotiations </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#48:1>
At the client 's request, the chosen carpets - - like fine
paintings - - are tested under different kinds of light and sunlight.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#49:1>
Should all conditions be satisfactory, final negotiations discreetly
take place and the transaction is consummated with the flourish of a gold
pen. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#50:1>
The client finally sets out into the golden Cappadocian plain
bereft of thousands of dollars, if not tens of thousands of dollars.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#51:1>
Yet the experience proves unforgettable and one happily discovers
that one is hooked on Turkey and Turkish carpets for life.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#52:1>
The living room is never the same again either. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#53:1>
When the early morning sun filters in, giving the carpet a soft
pastel hue, you can almost imagine the famed Blue <foreign> Mosque </foreign>
outside your window and Mehti coming in with a cup of apple tea. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> African violets are now so in </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#55:2>
<h> <bold> For a time, they were 'out'.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#56:2>
They 're making a comeback - - in new colors and shapes. </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#57:2>
<bold> Marietta V. Giron </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#58:2>
<bold> QUITE </bold> delicate and demanding of time and
attention, African Violets faded out of the scene for sometime.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#59:2>
But some dedicated fanciers managed to grow them over the years, and
they 're excited that the plants are back, this time in an array of new
colors and shapes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#60:2>
<quote> &ldquo; I haven't stopped growing African violets.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#61:2>
I just stopped adding on because people here stopped selling them,
&rdquo; </quote> said Adelaida Almazar, an avid African Violet ( AV) hobbyist
of over 20 years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#62:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Some of my violets have been around for years and
they 're just as lovely as the new hybrids.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#63:2>
I 've passed them on to my daughter Maricel, &rdquo; </quote> said
Alicia Javier, former president of the African Violet Society of the
Philippines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#64:2>
The AVs lure men as well. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#65:2>
The women say they love them for the company and the amount of
fuss they can shower the demanding plants.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#66:2>
The men claim they grow the AVs for the challenge and the variety of
experiments they can do. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#67:2>
Horticulturist Danny Tiu tries them in different soil-less
potting mix he has formulated out of pasteurized coconut fiber, coffee hull,
and rice husk. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#68:2>
Agriculturist Ray Ong propagates the plants by <quote> &ldquo;
chopping them. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#69:2>
By this , he means taking leaf cuttings that will produce baby AVs
when rooted in a propagating bed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#70:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Cut off mature leaves with their stalks and plant
them in moist sand or small grade of Mt. Pinatubo 's pumice.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#71:2>
In one month, each leaf cutting will produce young plants.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#72:2>
From one mother plant, you can produce easily a dozen plants.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#73:2>
AVs can be a source of extra income," </quote> he advises. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#74:2>
Young plants can be sold at &peso;30 each, and a blooming plant,
if it is a new hybrid, at &peso;200.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#75:2>
They can be sold in the neighborhood or consigned with shop owners in
the plant markets, according to Ong. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#76:2>
Vic Chin, a recent convert of AVs, says he collects the plants
because of the challenge and their commercial value. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#77:2>
<quote> &ldquo; They 're not so expensive like the orchids and
bulb plants, but they 're saleable enough these days. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#78:2>
Chin, a graduate of University of the Philippines Los
Ba&ntilde;os, is one of the newbreed horticulturists.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#79:2>
He propagates and sells pot plants in greenhouses at the back of the
family restaurant called <mention> Dinghao </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#80:2>
He has lilies, gerberas, spice plants, fancy hibiscus, bromeliads,
and other imported hybrids. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#81:2>
Among the experiments he does after his chores in the restaurant
on Calamba highway is finding the right soil mix and fertilizer formula for
the AVs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#82:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Like orchids and lilies, the AVs need very clean
potting mix, a well-balanced plant food, filtered sunlight, good air
circulation and sufficient water. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#83:2>
To make sure it 's humid enough and well-circulated in his
greenhouse, he had installed electric fans and sprinkles that are switched on
when it gets too hot and dry. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#84:2>
Growers Adelaida Almazar and Alice Javier grow their African
Violets on raised benches in the backyard.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#85:2>
Overhead the benches are several layers of fishnet that screen the
plants from direct sunlight. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#86:2>
Javier 's special potting recipe for her AVs uses chopped tree
fern roots, fine river sand, dried manure and garden soil.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#87:2>
These are moistened and &ldquo; cooked &rdquo; over fire.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#88:2>
By the time the soil is dry, all the harmful micro-organisms are
believed to be dead. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#89:2>
Almazar uses different combinations of potting ingredients which
include Canadian peat moss, perlite, sawdust with horse manure from the race
tracks, tree fern chips, <foreign> coir </foreign> dust, <foreign> etc.
</foreign>

<p>

<p>

<quote> &ldquo; It 's hard to stop growing them once you know the
trick to it. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#92:2>
They 've managed all these years to keep some of the old
varieties - - like the <mention> Elfried </mention> , <mention> Serenity
</mention> , and <mention> Victoria Reginae </mention> - - by patiently
propagating the plants through leaf cuttings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#93:2>
They do it two ways.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#94:2>
One is by rooting the leaf stems in a dish of water.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#95:2>
When the roots are out and baby plants are forming, the leaves are
placed on top of moist sand where the new baby plants will get established.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#96:2>
The other way is to plant the stems directly in moist sand or
perlite. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#97:2>
<quote> &ldquo; AVs need a lot of fussing over, and they seem to
grow best when they 're touched and fondled, &rdquo; </quote> Almazar says.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#98:2>
The AV fanciers have one thing in common.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#99:2>
They cannot get their hands off the plants. </p> </I>

<bold> A ROUND </bold> of golf in the executive courses, surfing
the clear blue waters of Anilao, Batangas, or curling up inside a Coleman
tent could be a nice weekend treat.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#103:3>
But any of these activities can also be time-consuming, physically
taxing or expensive. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#104:3>
The <indig> Haribon </indig> - Birdlife Philippines Program (
HBPP) has an alternative weekend activity - - birdwatching. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#105:3>
The first batch of <indig> Haribon </indig> 's birdwatchers took
to the woods of Mt. Makiling. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#106:3>
<h> <bold> Not yet popular </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#107:3>
Some of them came to cover the event for their publications.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#108:3>
Others came simply because they wanted to liven up their boring
Saturday afternoon.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#109:3>
A few just wanted to satisfy their curiosity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#110:3>
According to HBPP coordinator and batch lecturer Neil Aldrin,
birdwatching is not yet a popular hobby in the Philippines although birds are
integral parts of the country 's culture and history.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#111:3>
The interest in birdwatching is still marginal, but the HBPP plans
to involve children in the hobby. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#112:3>
Mallari pointed out that the Philippines recorded the highest
number of endemic bird species in the entire Southeast Asia.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#113:3>
Of the more than 550 recorded species, 169 are endemic, 200 are
resident species ( meaning, they cannot be found in other countries), and 150
are of the migratory type. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#114:3>
<quote> &ldquo; What is sad about the Philippines is that most
of the birds we know are either stuffed or caged," </quote> Mallari said.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#115:3>
<quote> &ldquo; We make business out of birds. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#116:3>
Species of dove, parrots and hornbills ( <indig> <it> kalaw
</it> </indig> ) are heavily hunted as pet birds, <quote> &ldquo; that 's why
we rarely see them now, &rdquo; </quote> Mallari said. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#117:3>
<h> <bold> Call note </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#118:3>
At the museum of the Makiling Botanical Garden, the weekend
birdwatchers viewed some of the country 's bird species in their stuffed
forms: common dabchick grebe, which breeds on lakes and ponds; brahminy kite,
found in Palawan and the Sulu archipelago; the serpent eagle found throughout
the Philippines, except Palawan, though it is quite uncommon; the zebra dove,
common in Luzon and Mindoro but very scarce in Mindanao. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#119:3>
In the book <mention> &ldquo; Birds of Java and Bali &rdquo;
</mention> by John MacKinnon, Philippine birds are classified into the
following ecological categories - - seabirds; freshwater swimming birds;
larger, long-legged water birds; waders and probers; larger, ground-living,
non-probing birds; raptors; larger frugivores or fruit-feeding birds;
larger-medium arboreal insectivores; and nocturnal insectivores. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#120:3>
Mallari said birds which ordinarily perch on tree limbs have
strong feet built for grasping, while birds that swim or those which live in
swampy areas have feet which may be completely or partially webbed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#121:3>
Mallari differentiated a <mention> &ldquo; call note &rdquo;
</mention> from a <mention> &ldquo; song &rdquo; </mention> in bird
communication.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#122:3>
<mention> Call notes </mention> constitute the bird 's language and
are heard throughout the year, but birds sing only during February, March and
April.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#123:3>
Singing indicates the readiness of the male for mating.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-017#124:3>
The female species do not sing. </p> </I>
