Mr Chief Justice, I love a good debate just like the next
lawyer
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#2:1:A>
But tonight I am tired of all this disputation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#3:1:A>
I am weary
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#4:1:A>
I want to go home to the love of my family
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#5:1:A>
Yet as a trained lawyer and as an advocate and disciple of the rule
of law I know that it is my duty to stand up tonight and affirm the fact that
a society of love can exist only if it is protected by the rule of law
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#6:1:A>
The law is not a litany or a series of technicalities an impression
that we might have gathered from what has been said in this hall today
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#7:1:A>
The law is the very basis of the social contract that pulls the
Filipinos together and renders them one nation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#8:1:A>
Long long ago the most famous litigant in the entire history of the
human race was asked by his judge <quote> Is it not true that you claim to be
the king </quote> and the litigant who was not a trained lawyer stared into
the face of his tormenter and said <quote> What is the truth </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#9:1:A>
For there are many truths there are many realities
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#10:1:A>
I stand for the rule of law as I see it according to the light that
has given <.> be </.> that has been given to me by my Creator
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#11:1:A>
No person no group no sector of society has a monopoly of the truth
or of the law
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#12:1:A>
That is why we must learn to accept each other 's conviction
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#13:1:A>
And that is why I intend that together with the rest of my
colleagues whom I hope will do likewise I intend to vote out of a sense of
the shared destiny of the Filipino people </I>

<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#14:2:A>
Uh Mr Chief Justice Mr Senate President my distinguished
colleagues
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#15:2:A>
I was almost disappointed that everything I wanted to say was said
in more eloquent terms by the Honorable Judge Senator Miriam
Defensor-Santiago
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#16:2:A>
But I have very little to add
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#17:2:A>
Uh Mr Chief Justice to me this is all about the rules and following
them
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#18:2:A>
The ultimate rule is the Philippine Constitution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#19:2:A>
When I rose in rebellion against three Presidents and what I
perceived then to be corrupt and inefficient governments everybody told me
that I had violated the Constitution and my oath of office as a soldier
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#20:2:A>
Mr President Mr Chief Justice whether we open the envelope the
second envelope or not the truth cannot be suppressed to the Filipino people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#21:2:A>
So instead of <,> spending time trying to defend the Constitution I
think we should all try to follow it first
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#22:2:A>
Thank you Mr Chief Justice </I> 


 <I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#23:3:A>
<&> missing words </&> Uhm to appeal to my friends and
colleagues in fact maybe if we can dispense with this as soon as possible it
is better
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#24:3:A>
But it 's in the nature of the impeachment process Mr Chief Justice
that passions there are passions and I can see the passion of the prosecution
I can see the passion of the defense
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#25:3:A>
And sometimes it is uh precisely because there is passion that we
as lawyers and we as Senators must now rise about above ourselves
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#26:3:A>
What is at issue Mr Chief Justice at court is an interlocutory
question but what is being judged is not just President Estrada
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#27:3:A>
We are now putting ourselves before the bar of history
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#28:3:A>
We are putting ourselves before the bar of public opinion and our
judgment on this interlocutory order can therefore affect not just President
Estrada but the Chamber and this impeachment court
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#29:3:A>
I rise consequently Mr Chief Justice to appeal to all of us to try
to consider the <,> interests of not only the Chamber as a Senate not only
the Chamber as an impeachment court but the <,> interests and responsibility
that we owe to all those who sent us here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#30:3:A>
Unfortunately there is nobody else being given the assignment to
try <&> five sentences in Tagalog </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#31:3:A>
If we convict or declare as innocent the respondent President
Estrada it must be on full transparency <&> seven long sentences in Tagalog
 </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#32:3:A>
The fact that we are on trial should make us pause Mr Chief Justice
and I hope we can achieve some consensus on some points
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#33:3:A>
<indig> Kung ano man po ang hatol ng </indig> impeachment court
 <indig> na </indig> to finally <indig> ma- </indig> guilty <indig> ma-
 </indig> innocent <indig> ang importante suportahan ng mamamayang Pilipino
 </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#34:3:A>
It does not it is not as important that it is <mention> guilty
 </mention> or <mention> innocent </mention> it must be supported by the
Filipino people and the Republic of the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#35:3:A>
This evening we seem to be about to cross a bridge and I hope Mr
Chief Justice that when we cross that we retain the higher credibility of the
impeachment court and the impeachment process <&> very long passage around 20
sentences in Tagalog </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#36:3:A>
In summary because I have less than two minutes I think if I may
appeal to my colleagues we are the ones now being judged it 's the Chamber
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#37:3:A>
As we vote on this we shall be judged
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#38:3:A>
And I hope we and I have the highest regard and whenever I 'm asked
by media I keep saying I have the highest expectations from my colleagues and
I hope that that expectation will be met and approved and accepted by the
Filipino people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#39:3:A>
Thank you </I> 


 <I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#40:4:A>
<&> missing words </&> Chief Justice that this uh matter
before us tonight is the same issue that was before us uh a few weeks ago I
believe uh before Christmas and that was the subject of an extended order uh
by the Chief Justice by the Presiding Officer dated December eighteen two
thousand
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#41:4:A>
And therefore I believe that to be consistent with that ruling then
the appropriate thing to do is to allow the opening of the second set of
documents
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#42:4:A>
Mr Chief Justice our job here is to ferret out the truth
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#43:4:A>
The people deserve nothing less than to know the truth
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#44:4:A>
<indig> Payagan po nating malaman ng taong bayan ang katotohanan sa
pagbukas po ng pangalawang documento </indig> </I> 


 <I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#45:5:A>
Thank you Mr Chief Justice
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#46:5:A>
<&> long passage in Tagalog </&> And since this is only the opening
of the envelope <indig> at kailangang malaman ng taong bayan kung anong
talagang katotohanan palagay ko </indig> Mr Chief Justice we owe it to the
nation we owe it to the Filipino we owe it to the millions who are now
listening to grant this simple request
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#47:5:A>
<indig> Buksan natin yung sobre upang malaman kung ano talaga ang
nakalagay diyan </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#48:5:A>
Why is the defense objecting so vigorously
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#49:5:A>
<indig> Kung natuloy ba 'yung plano na nabulgar dito na si </indig> 
Mr Dichaves <indig> ang may-ari ng </indig> savings account <indig> 
magkakaroon ba ng </indig> objection <indig> kagaya ng </indig> objection
 <indig> na hinaharap natin ngayon </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#50:5:A>
<indig> Palagay ko hindi magkakaroon ng ganoong </indig> objection
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#51:5:A>
<indig> Alam na ng bayan </indig> and the people have a right to
know we have a right to know
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#52:5:A>
And in the name of truth in the name of the Filipino in the name of
justice I ask this envelope be opened now
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#53:5:A>
Thank you </I> 


 <I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#54:6:A>
Uh Mr Chief Justice you know tonight the reputation of the
Senate as an institution is at stake
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#55:6:A>
For the past several weeks starting December seven the practically
the whole country has followed the progress of this impeachment trial via
television or radio or videotapes later on
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#56:6:A>
Everybody knows the evidence that has been brought out in this
trial whether they were accepted conditionally or absolutely they still know
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#57:6:A>
But what is important to this institution Mr Chief Justice is not
whether the final verdict of the Senators will be to convict or to acquit the
President of the Republic
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#58:6:A>
What is important is that the process was transparent and that the
verdict is in keeping with the evidence that has been brought out during this
trial
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#59:6:A>
<indig> Pag </indig> overwhelming <indig> po ang </indig> evidence
 <indig> e anong magagawa natin maa- </indig> acquit <indig> ba yan </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#60:6:A>
<indig> E magagalit ang taong bayan sa atin </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#61:6:A>
<indig> Pag kulang naman ang ebidensiya </indig> it would be
ridiculous for us to convict His Excellency the President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#62:6:A>
<indig> Hayon po noong </indig> December twenty <indig> ba ho 'yon
binuksan po natin yung </indig> envelope number one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#63:6:A>
<indig> Ang nakasulat ho diyan <mention> Jose Velarde </mention> 
 </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#64:6:A>
<indig> Wala namang koneksiyon pa kay Pangulong Erap Estrada
 </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#65:6:A>
<indig> Ngunit meron hong </indig> notation <indig> diyan na eto po
ang </indig> the other half of a combo account <indig> at nakasulat po doon
yung </indig> saving account number <indig> ni Jose Velarde </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#66:6:A>
Later on when Clarissa Ocampo testified that indeed she saw the
President of the Republic sign <mention> Jose Velarde </mention> to five sets
of documents the agency agreement or investment management agreement the
authorization to debit his savings account the very same numbered savings
account that was in the first set of documents that came out of the first
envelope delivered here by Equitable Bank and other documents that was when
the connection was made
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#67:6:A>
Now the Senate allowed the opening of the first envelope the Senate
allowed the testimony of Clarissa Ocampo and people found Clarissa Ocampo to
be very very credible
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#68:6:A>
After all she had no reason to lie
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#69:6:A>
<indig> Ngayon po dito po sa </indig> account that is being hidden
inside envelope number two the savings account as asserted earlier by
prosecutor Joker Arroyo contains deposits or will show reported deposits of
about three point three billion pesos over a span of twelve months
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#70:6:A>
<indig> Malamang po nandiyan po yung deposito na galing sa </indig> 
tobacco fund <indig> na sinabi na binanggit ni </indig> Governor <indig> 
Chavit Singson na binigay daw niya kay Atong Ang at binigay ni Atong Ang kay
Joseph Estrada </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#71:6:A>
<indig> Paano natin malalaman 'yon </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#72:6:A>
<indig> Malamang nandiyan din ho 'yung </indig> two hundred million
 <indig> na binigay po ni Ricaforte kay Ed Serapio at dineposito daw ni Ed
Serapio sa isang </indig> Equitable Bank account same bank
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#73:6:A>
As a matter of fact the treasurer of the Erap Muslim Youth
Foundation is none other than the Chairman of the Board or then Chairman of
the Board and majority owner George L Go
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#74:6:A>
So <indig> sa ngayon po </indig> as a member of this impeachment
panel <indig> ako po'y nagtataka kung bakit po natatakot ang </indig> defense
panel <indig> na buksan po itong </indig> envelope <indig> na ito </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#75:6:A>
<indig> Sapagkat una sa lahat nadinig ko po </indig> and I have
heard it several times that His Excellency the President said <quote> I have
not committed graft and corruption
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#76:6:A>
I have not received a single cent from any source that is illegal
 </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#77:6:A>
And when Clarissa Ocampo testified I remember the President said
 <quote> <indig> wala akong kinalalaman diyan </indig> </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#78:6:A>
So why is the defense panel so afraid to open this
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#79:6:A>
On the other hand <indig> baka pag buksan 'tong </indig> envelope
 <indig> na ito tapos na yung boksing </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#80:6:A>
And that is where we are tonight
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#81:6:A>
So Mr Chief Justice when we took an oath to be members of this
impeachment panel we took an oath to render impartial justice
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#82:6:A>
As far as I 'm concerned the one on trial here the President of the
Republic is not really the one on trial
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#83:6:A>
It is the Senate that is on trial
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#84:6:A>
And furthermore the Senate has been conducting this impeachment
trial to make sure that society can be saved from anybody who would be
declared unfit for public office
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#85:6:A>
Simple question
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#86:6:A>
Can a President or any official deposit three point three billion
pesos in his account and still be fit for public office
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#87:6:A>
That 's the question tonight
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#88:6:A>
And if we vote not to open envelope two and I know that the
contents of envelope two will somehow find its way into the newspapers if not
tomorrow then the day after and the whole country will know what is in
envelope two then I think the members of this body will only have themselves
to blame for trying to make sure that the Filipinos lose on a technicality
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#89:6:A>
<indig> Pag me na- </indig> technical <indig> ho rito ang taong
bayan po na- </indig> technical
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#90:6:A>
And therefore Mr Chief Justice I move that we open the envelope and
even accept on condition in the same manner that we opened the first envelope
and we allowed Clarissa Ocampo to testify
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#91:6:A>
So that later on we as members of the impeachment body may decide
whether indeed the testimony and the documents were relevant or not
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-065#92:6:A>
Thank you Mr Chief Justice </I>
