RE : <h> <it> Departmental Workshop </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#6:1>
Kindly submit your request for the funding of your departmental
summer planning workshops.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#7:1>
The allotted budget is &peso;650 per faculty member, part-time or
full-time.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#8:1>
The request should be accompanied by a list of faculty members
expected to attend the said activity ( indicate the dates).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#9:1>
A department may get its entire workshop budget provided at least 70%
of its faculty attend the workshop.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#10:1>
A faculty member will be given funding to go to only one workshop
even if s/he also teaches in another unit other than his/her mother unit.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#11:1>
The checks will be released in the name of the department
chair/unit head.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#12:1>
All expenses have to be liquidated. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#13:1>
The departments which won attendance awards will receive the
corresponding increases in their workshop budgets: Science Education
Department ( 100%), Teacher Education Department ( 80%), Religious Studies
Department ( 60%), Department of Communication ( 40%), and Business
Management Department ( 20%). </p>

RE: <h> ICO-MCO Merger </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#35:3>
Starting third term of the current school year, the Institutional
Communication Office ( ICO) and the Marketing Coordination Office ( MCO) will
merge as one department to integrate the different components of the
University 's marketing campaign.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#36:3>
The ICO will take charge of internal public relations, and will,
thus, complement the marketing and public relations functions of MCO. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#37:3>
Under the new setup, the MCO will continue to handle the overall
marketing of the University.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#38:3>
It will take charge of designing and executing marketing programs, as
well as implementing a publicity program to support institutional imaging
efforts.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#39:3>
On the other hand, the ICO will still manage and supervise the
production of institutional publications such as the Newsletter, the <indig>
Abut Tanaw </indig> , institutional and college brochures, and other major
University publications. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#40:3>
While the MCO and ICO will remain in their respective offices,
the two will operate as one unit.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#41:3>
With the integration, we can expect the implementation of a more
cohesive marketing communication program for the University.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#42:3>
The merger will further ensure institutional promotion efforts that
will be consistent with La Salle 's overall marketing goals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#43:3>
I enjoin our community to support the efforts of MCO-ICO. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#48:4>
Re: <h> Result of the Negotiations in the Multisectoral Committee on
Budget ( MSCB) for Tuition Fee Increase ( TFI) </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#49:4>
This is to inform you that during its seventh ( 7th) meeting held
last Thursday, February 9, the MSCB decided to set the average TFI for SY
1999-2000 at 12%.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#50:4>
This translates into a 10.5% TFI for upperclassmen and 16.5% TFI for
freshmen. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#51:4>
The initial meeting of the MSCB was held on 3 December 1998.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#52:4>
During this meeting, the ground rules for the negotiations were
agreed upon.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#53:4>
The second meeting was held January 5, 1999.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#54:4>
After this, the MSCB met regularly every Tuesday from 12 noon to 2:30
p.m. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#55:4>
The initial proposals of the different sectors were:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#56:4>
Administration: 11% - 18%

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#57:4>
Students: 5% - 7%

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#58:4>
Faculty: 15% - 18%

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#59:4>
PUSO <&> =Parents of University Students' Organization </&> : 7% - 9%
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#60:4>
While the DLSUEA <&> =employees' association </&> initially
announced that they will not submit any proposal for the TFI and will simply
go along with the majority decision, on the sixth meeting, their President
made it known to the body that the employees and staff would like to have no
less than last year 's average TFI which was 12.875%. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#61:4>
After much discussion which touched upon inflation rates ( both
current and projected), economic difficulties, working conditions of DLSU
faculty compared with their counterparts in other schools, cost of quality
education and the like, the MSCB finally came up with the decision mentioned
above. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#62:4>
Unlike last year 's negotiations, the conduct of this year 's
MSCB meetings remained very proper, amicable and professional.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#63:4>
This could be mainly attributed to the level-headed, diplomatic and
skillfull leadership of the presiding officer, Mr. Eric Musngi, the PUSO
President. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#64:4>
Those who participated in the MSCB deliberations this year are:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#65:4>
<it> PUSO Representatives </it> : <O> names </O>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#66:4>
<it> Student Council Representatives </it> : <O> names </O>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#67:4>
<it> Administration Representatives </it> : <O> names </O>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#68:4>
<it> DLSUFA Representatives </it> : <O> names </O>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#69:4>
<it> DLSUEA Representatives </it> : <O> names </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#70:4>
Although she did not attend any meetings of the MSCB, Ms.
Cristela Goce-Dakila also helped in gathering data and making analysis for
use of the FA representatives in presenting the FA stand during the MSCB
meetings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#71:4>
Unlike in the previous years where the average TFI automatically
resulted in an almost similar across-the-board faculty salary increase, this
will not be the case this year.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#72:4>
The reason is that we are currently restructuring the faculty salary
scale in order to remove overlaps in consecutive ranks.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#73:4>
The purpose of overlaps is to ensure that any upward movement in rank
will carry with it a corresponding financial reward.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#74:4>
In view of the restructuring, it is possible that some of us will get
higher than 12% salary increase while others will get lower than 12% salary
increase.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#75:4>
We have not yet finalized the proposed restructured salary scale but
we will inform you about it as soon as we can. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#76:4>
Rest assured that we are doing our best to get results that will
be most beneficial to the faculty in general. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#77:4>
Thank you for cooperation and support for the decisions of the
DLSUFA Executive Board. </p> </I>

<bold> Re: <h> Reminder on the Handling of Petty Cash Funds </h>
</bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#84:5>
Last May 31, 1998 the Audit Department conducted their annual
audit of the University 's various Petty Cash Funds.

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#86:5>
<h> <bold> Finding no. 1 </bold> </h> :

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#87:5>
The policy on petty cash replenishment is not strictly being
followed.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#88:5>
Some of the custodians resort to using personal money when they run
out of fund which resulted to cash overage. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#89:5>
<h> <it> Recommendation </it> </h> :

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#90:5>
The Petty Cash Custodians must strictly observe the policy on petty
cash replenishment which states that, <quote> &ldquo; When the petty cash
fund expenses has reached 70% of the fund, they should request for
replenishment". </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#91:5>
Mingling of personal funds with the petty cash fund is prohibited.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#92:5>
<h> <bold> Finding no. 2 </bold> </h> :

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#93:5>
Some petty cash custodians do not use petty cash vouchers to support
disbursement from the fund. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#94:5>
<h> <it> Recommendation </it> </h> :

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#95:5>
All payments from the petty cash fund should be covered by petty cash
voucher.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#96:5>
The voucher must bear approval of the authorized signatory to the
fund.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#97:5>
Upon replenishment a summary of all expenses must be prepared grouped
into category of expenses approved by the authorized signatory and submitted
to Accounting Office for replenishment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#98:5>
<h> <bold> Finding no. 3 </bold> </h> :

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#99:5>
Some custodians failed to liquidate their petty cash fund upon
resignation or retirement. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#100:5>
<h> <it> Recommendation </it> </h> :

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#101:5>
Petty Cash Custodians are required to liquidate or make a turn-over
of their accountability when they resign or retire.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#102:5>
Also, custodians are required to hand-over their petty cash funds to
their Heads when they go on long leave of absence.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#103:5>
The Head will then appoint a temporary custodian until his/her
return.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#104:5>
Contractual Staff are disqualified from being appointed petty cash
custodians as they are not employees of the University. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#105:5>
Please be guided accordingly. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#150:6>
To help hasten the review process for the possible renewal of
your Chair, please ensure that by the end of the third term you will have:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#151:6>
1. given the required lecture; and

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#152:6>
2. submitted an accomplishment report to the VPA, through the Dean,
regarding the chair, together with copies of your lecture.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#153:6>

place and circumstances of the presentation, are submitted. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-029#154:6>
Non-compliance with the terms of the award may be ground for
