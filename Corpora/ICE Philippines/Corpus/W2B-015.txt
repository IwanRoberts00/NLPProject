<h> <bold> The hospital: Mirror of the Filipino soul </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#2:1>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#3:1>
The year 1998 being the Philippine Centennial year, questions are
often raised about what constitutes the Filipino soul.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#4:1>
Who is Filipino?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#5:1>
What is he <it> really </it> like?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#6:1>
What makes him special?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#7:1>
Though there are a variety of ways to answer these questions, may I
suggest a rather unorthodox means?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#8:1>
Go visit a hospital! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#9:1>
Yes, I mean it, a hospital!

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#10:1>
True, a hospital evokes images and feelings associated with pain and
dread, but its very nature makes it a suitable showcase of the Filipino
spirit at its best.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#11:1>
Because life is vulnerable and precarious here, thoughts, feelings,
and actions are laid bare.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#12:1>
In a hospital, where people sense the urgency of time and the
limitations of life, there is no need to pretend nor to trivialize one 's
self.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#13:1>
The hospital, in this sense, is not a hypocritical place - - what you
see is what you get.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#14:1>
And in the case of Filipinos, what you get is a spirit shining
through and soaring high. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#15:1>
I remember once, when I was on duty, I opened the door of a
hospital room and a motley group of teens, kids, and adults crowded their way
past me.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#16:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Bye and thanks for visiting!" </quote> waved the
appreciative lady who I correctly surmised to be the patient 's wife.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#17:1>
Before I could enter, I saw another group down the corridor headed
for the room.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#18:1>
Seeing my amused look, the wife smiled and said, nodding towards the
group that had just left, <quote> &ldquo; They are from my husband 's side.
&rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#19:1>
Then pointing to the new group, <quote> &ldquo; They 're from my side
of the family. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#20:1>
As I checked on the patient 's vital signs inside the room, I
couldn't help but notice the scene which has since become familiar - - the
table was stacked with biscuits, cakes, fruits, flowers given by visitors.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#21:1>
The food was not for the patient because he was still on orders not
to eat!

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#22:1>
Soon the new group settled snugly into the room, greeting the
patient, chatting up a storm, and later munching on the food which the wife
offered.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#23:1>
Through all the seeming racket, I noted the relieved, contented look
on the patient 's face.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#24:1>
Why, it was just as if they were just in the <foreign> <it> sala
</it> </foreign> of his own home! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#25:1>
This encompassing, pervasive sense of home - - of a living haven,
of a tender refuge - - is imprinted in the heart of the Filipino.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#26:1>
It is just as much an attitude, a frame of mind, that enables him to
imbue warmth and a sense of intimacy wherever he goes.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#27:1>
Foreigners often say that what they like most about Filipinos is that
they treat their guests <quote> &ldquo; like family, &rdquo; </quote> and
seeing Filipinos behave in a hospital, one realizes how correct they are.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#28:1>
In the same vein, I remember a letter which my mom had received from
an American patient.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#29:1>
She had undergone rehabilitation with my physical therapist sister,
and she was so profuse about my sister having treated her far more than a
&ldquo; mere &rdquo; patient that she even thanked my mom for having raised
such an affectionate daughter! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#30:1>
Another Filipino quality that a hospital best draws out is the
ability to sympathize, to be compassionate.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#31:1>
Rarely have I seen a Filipino <it> alone </it> , whether for
check-ups with doctors or when confined.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#32:1>
I remember questioning an elderly man once about a mass in his
inguinal area.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#33:1>
His daughter could recount all the details pertinent to the case with
remarkable accuracy!

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#34:1>
One of the greatest consolations of a doctor in the Philippines,
then, is that he has very cooperative and zealous partners in the care of his
patients.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#35:1>
Whether it be an out-patient, a confined or a recuperating one, he
can be sure that the wife, sibling, friend, whoever-it-be will see to it that
the patient conforms to all of the doctor 's orders. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#36:1>
I have also seen relatives and friends remaining for days in the
intensive care unit, literally sharing in the pain of their loved ones.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#37:1>
From the street urchin, the village goon, to the neighborhood
beautician, a friend, a <indig> <it> barkada </it> </indig> , a relative will
be there, even alternating among themselves, from admission to discharge.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#38:1>
And in the province, it is a common sight to see a jeep load or two
of relatives and friends accompanying a patient to the emergency room from
the <foreign> barrios </foreign> !

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#39:1>
Complete strangers will also bring their fellow-Filipinos to the E.R.
after vehicular accidents.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#40:1>
If health is indeed wealth, how sweetly ironic that it is during his
time of illness that a Filipino realizes how richly blessed he is! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#41:1>
And then there is the Filipino 's legendary faith.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#42:1>
Next to a church perhaps, the best place to witness Filipino faith up
close is in the hospital.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#43:1>
One can see it in the crucifixes, rosaries, or statues of saints
placed by the patient or his family near his bedside.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#44:1>
One can see it in patients clutching rosary beads and wearing
scapulars <foreign> en route </foreign> to an operation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#45:1>
One can see it in prayer books tucked under the patient 's pillow.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#46:1>
One can feel it in the silence of relatives praying for their loved
ones ' health in the hospital chapel.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#47:1>
And one can sense it the most in the quiet but faithful surrender of
patients when they are told that their illness is terminal.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#48:1>
Filipinos have an abiding faith that God will pull them through tough
times, even death, but they have as much resolute faith when God decides
otherwise. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#49:1>
Filipinos are also a grateful people.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#50:1>
We know how to be thankful, and do so profusely.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#51:1>
Doctors know this very well.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#52:1>
I once accompanied a patient for referral at a hospital, and the next
day his father gave me three hens.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#53:1>
No matter how much I protested that they were too much, he was
insistent that I have them.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#54:1>
I once helped a neurologic patient avail of charity service at a
reputable hospital and I have since lost track of the many pineapples,
<indig> <it> langka </it> </indig> , avocados and bananas that his family has
given me!

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#55:1>
It is rightfully said that the Filipino has experienced just about
the worst of everything - - floods, drought, poverty, even volcanic ash from
out of nowhere - - but he has survived smiling.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#56:1>
After being in hospitals for a while, one can understand why.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#57:1>
Despite all of life 's adversities, the Filipino knows how to look
heavenward and still say, <quote> &ldquo; Thank You for life itself. &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#58:1>
This sense of home, great compassion, faith in His God, and
profound gratitude, all of those qualities Filipinos can be proud of - - the
hospital serves as a mirror of the best of the Filipino spirit.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#59:1>
Perhaps if each and every Filipino were to take it upon himself to
practice these outstanding qualities everyday, we would be a truly healthy
nation, in every possible way. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Dissecting Rights and Privileges </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#61:2>
<bold> Wihelmina Orozco </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#62:2>
A bus driver was weaving in and out of the traffic at a fast
pace.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#63:2>
At first, a passenger cautioned the driver in an indirect manner but
their conversation lengthened to include discussions of rights and
privileges: </p> <indig>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#64:2>
Passenger: Mama, nahihilo ako sa pagmamaneho ninyo.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#65:2>
Driver: Ale, sumakay kayo ng taksi

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#66:2>
Passenger: Mama, nagbayad ako nang husto.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#67:2>
Driver: Eto ang bayad ninyo.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#68:2>
Lumipat na lang kayo ng ibang sasakyan.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#69:2>
Passenger: Mama, karapatan kong makarating sa aking pupuntahan sa
isang matiwasay at mapayapang paraan.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#70:2>
Driver: E angal kayo ng angal.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#71:2>
Passenger: Mama, ang bus ay pang public service, hindi private
service.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#72:2>
Kailangang pangalagaan ninyo ang buhay ng mga pasahero ninyo.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#73:2>
Ang tawag sa ginagawa ninyo ay reckless driving kahit na itanong pa
natin sa traffic enforcer. </indig>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#74:2>
The conversation ended.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#75:2>
Yet, this tug-of-war between rights and privileges is replicated in
many instances.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#76:2>
For example, when we pay for and ride a plane to Bacolod we are
exercising our right to travel.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#77:2>
Being able to listen to beautiful music inside the plane and being
served are privileges or perks that an airline gives to attract passengers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#78:2>
Our right extends only to being brought from Manila to that city at a
particular time and date.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#79:2>
However, when the flight gets delayed, and we miss our lunch, then it
is our right to be served meals by the crew and to be provided with lodging
while awaiting boarding if it is a delayed evening flight.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#80:2>
Otherwise we can charge the airline with business malpractice.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#81:2>
But my claim about our <it> right to mobility </it> extends to the
travel tax being leveled against all outgoing citizens.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#82:2>
Aren't fees for travel abroad violative of our right to travel?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#83:2>
Supposing we cannot pay them, are we going to be barred from
traveling despite our having a ticket to our destination?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#84:2>
The fees were levied based on law issued by Marcos in trying to
inhibit those so-called &ldquo; subversives &rdquo; from using a foreign base
to attack his human rights abuses and to raise funds for his family 's
personal aggrandizement.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#85:2>
So it would be really important to challenge the legality of that law
now. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#86:2>
<h> <bold> Right to work: </bold> </h> On the aspect of labor,
our Constitution grants everyone the right to work.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#87:2>
Now, even if an agreement is reached between the Philippines (
through the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration) and the foreign
country with regard to the workers ' treatment, still workers will be at the
mercy of the latter - - in terms of work conditions, health care and shelter.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#88:2>
More fundamentally in particular, many of our workers are now in the
Middle East and Asian countries known for suspending and violating basic
human rights such as the basic freedom of expression, of assembly, of
religion, and other human rights.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#89:2>
As the Department of Labor and Employment is supposed to uphold the
dignity of labor and guarantee basic human rights, should we not make the
POEA redundant, now? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#90:2>
<h> <bold> Artistic freedom: </bold> </h> Another issue is the
freedom of expression guaranteed by the Constitution, the method, either in
print or through other artistic institutions that allow every individual to
express himself/herself.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#91:2>
However, art grants should be democratically disbursed to many
individuals and groups.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#92:2>
The system of coddling resident companies for more than one year at
cultural institutions negates the democratic process. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#93:2>
<h> <bold> Marcosian laws: </bold> </h> A current legal case is
testing our knowledge of our rights in the light of those laws produced
before and under the martial law regime.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#94:2>
A certain real estate company is trying to collect compensation for
reclaiming, before martial law was institutionalized, the lands now being
occupied by the Cultural Center of the Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#95:2>
Facts of the case refer to the company 's violating bidding
procedures which nullified their right to continue to work on reclamation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#96:2>
The question is do we interpret the law now in the light of past or
current laws?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#97:2>
Marcos solely enacted certain laws providing a crony the privilege to
continue reclamation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#98:2>
Did he violate the right of the real estate company to just
compensation by expropriating the land?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#99:2>
I think in so far as the act did not divest the people of the right
to own the land and enjoy its uses, then it is considered lawful.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#100:2>
But if the reclamation resulted in the land being owned and its use
being enjoyed by private individuals and companies, then it is highly
unlawful.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#101:2>
As the case stands now, the reclaimed land is still government, and
not crony land, although some elite parties could be enjoying the use of that
piece of land.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#102:2>
On a broader basis, the new Constitution of 1987 would point to the
land reclamation as violative of the right of the people to access to aquatic
and marine resources. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#103:2>
<h> <bold> Right to a peaceful life: </bold> </h> Our rights in
our domestic surroundings are worthwhile dissecting, also.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#104:2>
For example, children have the right to be free and happy.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#105:2>
They can play, sing and make noise if they want to.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#106:2>
But if they are playing in an area between two tall buildings and
their voices reverberate for one hour or more, causing disturbance to other
tenants, then it is the time for the parents to tell them off, that they are
violating their neighbor 's <it> right to peaceful living </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#107:2>
For that matter, radios blaring at a certain number of decibels and
from 9 p.m. onwards is considered nuisance.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#108:2>
Along the same vein, a tenant can have as many cars he or she wants.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#109:2>
But as soon as the second car appropriates the space provided for
the next tenant, then the former is already violating the space of the
latter.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#110:2>
These are minor details that could escalate to big conflicts if not
properly examined and resolved among residents in one community.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#111:2>
Another example is a grave concern of women 's rights advocates:
when a person physically abuses another inside the home, then even the
neighbors have the <it> right to intervene </it> because he or she is already
committing an abuse of another person 's life.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#112:2>
Intervention can range from bringing the police to stop the act,
barging into the home to control the abuser, up to the extent of teaching the
victim his/her right to separate from that abuser, no matter if they are
married or related by affinity or consanguinity.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#113:2>
By the way, I wonder if priests deliver sermons along this line.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#114:2>
They would ease a lot of the problems of government welfare and
human rights agencies by suggesting to their flock how to treat each other
and behave more humanely, especially during life-threatening situations.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#115:2>
Anyway, what the priests could be neglecting, active women have
taken over proficiently.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#116:2>
Women 's consciousness-raising groups have discovered that teaching
women their right to say when, where, and how to receive verbal and physical
expressions of love from, is important for raising their self-esteem, and
keeping a harmonious relationship, with their partner.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#117:2>
In other words, they are emphasizing that intimate relationships
require a symbiotic interaction. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#118:2>
<h> <bold> Punitive or preventive?: </bold> </h> A most recent
human rights case is the Manila mayor 's directive of painting red all homes
of suspected drug pushers and users.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#119:2>
How lawful or rightful is his action?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#120:2>
If <it> all </it> the tenants of the homes are guilty, not suspected
of drug pushing, and that they have pending cases in court for such crimes,
his action looks legal; but if not, is this not a case of witchhunting,
auguring or foretelling a kind of rightist administration that could trample
on our other human rights in the long run?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#121:2>
We understand that the mayor means well but his act looks punitive
rather than preventive of crimes, apart from causing tension and anxieties in
the communities.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-015#122:2>
Besides, many other healthy ways can be devised for solving the drug
problem, if only the expertise of social scientists would be tapped. </p>
</I>
