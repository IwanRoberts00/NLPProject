Thank you Speaker Jose de Venecia
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#2:1:A>
Senate President Franklin Drilon the justices of the Supreme Court
distinguished members of the Senate and the House of Representatives His
Excellency Archbishop Antonio Franco dean of the diplomatic corps Your
Excellencies of the diplomatic corps members of the cabinet members of the
Armed Forces of the Philippines members of the police fellow workers in
government honored guests <indig> mga minamahal kong kababayan </indig>

In the corridors of power in the Palace where I work past Presidents
of the Republic sit in their portraits in judgment of me
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#4:1:A>
In this gallery of the highest public servants none sits in sterner
judgment than the man who first led me by the hand into the Palace as a
teenager
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#5:1:A>
In that country where a man 's worth was measured by his poverty he
was born in a <indig> nipa </indig> hut into a family that tilled less than a
hectare of land
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#6:1:A>
After years of hard struggle and brilliant achievement my father
took his oath as President of the Philippines on ground made hallow by the
martyrdom of our national hero a hero whose name he would honor and whose
ideals he would pursue
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#7:1:A>
Indeed in a democracy a man may rise to the nation 's highest
service by dint of energy and intelligence alone without regard to wealth and
connections of which my father had none
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#8:1:A>
It was Jose Rizal who wrote <quote> a life dedicated to a great
ideal is useless uh not dedicated to a great ideal is useless a mere pebble
in the field that forms no part of an edifice </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#9:1:A>
The words of Diosdado Macapagal echoed this theme has as he assumed
the mantle of national leadership forty years ago <quote> no President can
build the whole edifice of a nation <X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#X10:1:A>
All that he is called upon to do is to add a fine stone to that
edifice so that those who shall come after him may add other fine stones that
will go for a strong and enduring structure </X> </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#11:1:A>
Modest words from a modest man who would yet change for all time
how a feudal society would come to view a vital institution land reform
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#12:1:A>
My countrymen the fine stone I should like to add to the edifice of
our nation right above the stone of social justice that my father left behind
is a strong republic
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#13:1:A>
Two essential features mark out a strong republic
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#14:1:A>
The first is independence from class and sectoral interests so that
it stands for the interests of the people rather than of a powerful minority
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#15:1:A>
The second is the capacity represented through strong institutions
and a strong bureaucracy to execute good policy and deliver essential
services the things that only governments can do
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#16:1:A>
The results of these two features good policies and empowered
institutions is faster economic development and social reform
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#17:1:A>
A strong republic takes care of the people and takes care of their
future
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#18:1:A>
Thus a strong republic is the bedrock of the victory we seek over
poverty within the decade
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#19:1:A>
During these past eighteen months our efforts to build the strong
republic have been difficult with both domestic and global conditions
extremely harsh
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#20:1:A>
At home the poor were pitted against the rich to further inflame
our nation 's social divisions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#21:1:A>
Abroad the contracting economies of our main trading partners were
further aggravated by the tensions generated by the global war against <.> 
terroris </.> terrorism
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#22:1:A>
Meanwhile one shocking corporate scandal after another severely
eroded public faith in the most promising system for conducting economic
activity the free market
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#23:1:A>
These were the large long-term crises of social justice and the
capitalist system itself whose resolution awaits events well beyond one small
nation 's ability to influence in the short term
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#24:1:A>
But as I report on the state of the nation today I can say this the
immediate crises have been resolved
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#25:1:A>
This resolution was achieved by focusing on three things
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#26:1:A>
First by showing tangible results in the delivery of government
services
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#27:1:A>
Thus in my State of the Nation Address last year I did something
never done before I detailed a long list of measurable targets that would
show a government on the move marking progress by swift sure steps despite
the turbulent state of domestic and global affairs <&> seven minutes of
targets and accomplishments discussed in Tagalog interspersed with applause
 </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#28:1:A>
This is just the tip of our accomplishments all in just the first
year of the ten-year fight I projected against poverty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#29:1:A>
I am submitting the entire iceberg to Congress in a comprehensive
performance report
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#30:1:A>
For good measure it has been published and nationally circulated
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#31:1:A>
These were our commitments
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#32:1:A>
We delivered on them
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#33:1:A>
A strong republic does what it says
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#34:1:A>
It takes care of the people and takes care of their future
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#35:1:A>
Our second focus to achieve the resolution of the immediate crises
was the preservation and defense of the Republic against forces that seek to
destroy its unity and tear the fabric of its society not least in the name of
ideas that history has already passed by
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#36:1:A>
The turning points are clear
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#37:1:A>
This year May one passed peacefully
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#38:1:A>
This year our soldiers rescued Gracia Burnham and finished off her
terrorist captor <&> applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#39:1:A>
This year what used to be Camp Abubakar became an authentic
community of new hopes and dreams where our flag flies and our soldiers
protect those who have returned to their homes
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#40:1:A>
Beyond the symbolic significance of these accomplishments we have
brought back inter-faith <.> solida </.> solidarity energized by the
invaluable initiative of Speaker Jose de Venecia <&> applause </&> and we
have sealed peace agreements with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#41:1:A>
We achieved all of these backed by the valor professionalism and
restraint of our soldiers and police
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#42:1:A>
I salute our men and women in uniform at the forefront of our
Republic 's efforts to fight terror and enforce peace
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#43:1:A>
The third focus to resolve the crises and build a strong republic
was to restore macroeconomic stability and win back investor confidence
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#44:1:A>
The linchpin was to control our fiscal deficit
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#45:1:A>
If EDSA two had not happened the government would simply have gone
bankrupt with a deficit of two hundred forty-five billion pesos <&> applause
 </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#46:1:A>
But we controlled the deficit brought it down to a hundred
forty-seven billion pesos and against all odds turned our international
credit rating from <mention> risky </mention> to <mention> stable </mention> 
 <&> applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#47:1:A>
It was hard work here and abroad to rekindle global interest in our
country but we did it <&> applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#48:1:A>
The adoption of strong administrative measures including fighting
smuggling and graft and corruption will enable us to close the gap in our
revenue targets for this year
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#49:1:A>
The basic macro signs indicate that things are under control
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#50:1:A>
Inflation is at a low driven down by stable food prices and now by
declining power costs <&> applause </&> <&> four sentences comparing prices
then and now in Tagalog interspersed with applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#51:1:A>
Interest rates are also at a low
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#52:1:A>
And our peso is stable from fifty-six pesos to the dollar it is now
a little over fifty pesos <&> applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#53:1:A>
Internationally the Philippines is back on the map
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#54:1:A>
We are the third best-performing economy in Asia and the best in
Southeast Asia <&> applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#55:1:A>
As a result of our decisive action after September eleven the
Philippines is now a recognized player in world affairs
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#56:1:A>
The President of the Philippines was the first head of government
to emphasize the interconnection between the war against terrorism and the
war against poverty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#57:1:A>
Now nations large and small embrace this interconnection <&> 
applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#58:1:A>
We have gained powerful allies in our domestic war against
terrorism
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#59:1:A>
I am certain that our increased international visibility will
continue generating capital inflows for the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#60:1:A>
Where we have fallen short of achieving what we intended it has not
been from misdirection or a lack of trying
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#61:1:A>
After all it has really been only one year and a half
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#62:1:A>
In any event I promise to work even harder if that is possible and
do even better because I believe that there is always room for improvement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#63:1:A>
I cannot grow taller but I can always get better <&> applause and
laughter </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#64:1:A>
My working agenda for the coming year will focus on creating and
improving job opportunities
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#65:1:A>
Citizens with rewarding jobs paying decent wages constitute not
just a stone in the edifice but the very foundation of a strong republic
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#66:1:A>
We need investments to generate jobs and to draw in investments we
will address certain problems in the short term <indig> katiwalian </indig> 
peace and order and the cost of power <&> applause </&> <&> five sentences in
Tagalog </&> <&> break in recording </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#67:1:A>
But even now I can tell you that our new e-procurement program is
saving billions and minimizing anomalies
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#68:1:A>
Even now I can tell you that the Presidential Anti-Graft Commission
is doing its best to ensure that good governance is carried out <&> five
sentences in Tagalog </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#69:1:A>
This is still a continuing effort
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#70:1:A>
Tax evasion is a white-collar crime and the response is a
white-collar response systems improvement audit prosecution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#71:1:A>
Smuggling is something else
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#72:1:A>
It is done by hoodlums and criminal gangs
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#73:1:A>
But the punishment for both must be the same blue-collar time
 <indig> kalaboso </indig> <&> applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#74:1:A>
Indeed criminal gangs and homegrown terrorists have exploited the
poisoned political atmosphere to spread poisons of their own kidnapping
gambling drug-dealing rampant smuggling
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#75:1:A>
You have seen political will in the harsh interpretation of command
responsibility with regard to illegal gambling
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#76:1:A>
That draconian application was a dress rehearsal for enforcing
command responsibility in the even more difficult challenges of kidnapping
drug-dealing and smuggling <&> applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#77:1:A>
I am determined to build a strong republic by breaking the back of
terrorism and criminality <&> applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#78:1:A>
In the year two thousand despite all the rampant efforts of rampant
smuggling only sixteen million pesos worth was confiscated
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#79:1:A>
But last year in a show of political will my administration seized
one point two billion pesos worth of smuggled goods <&> applause </&> 
including more than a million bags of smuggled rice as compared to much less
than a hundred thousand the year before
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#80:1:A>
I congratulated the Commissioner of Customs but told him also go
beyond getting the smuggled goods and get me the big time smugglers <&> 
applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#81:1:A>
I have instructed the D O J to charge these big-time smugglers not
just with smuggling but also with economic sabotage non-bailable capital
offense <&> applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#82:1:A>
Criminal syndicates will be treated as what they are direct threats
to national security
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#83:1:A>
Criminals are criminals whether of the common kind or the kind that
will kill in the name of political advocacies
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#84:1:A>
They will feel the full brunt of the arsenal of democracy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#85:1:A>
Freedom too is entitled to self-defense
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#86:1:A>
I have given very clear orders to spare nothing in hunting down
kidnappers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#87:1:A>
We will go by scorecards and track progress by counting beans if we
have to
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#88:1:A>
Remember Mary Grace Rosagas of Uratex who was kidnapped from U P
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#89:1:A>
Remember her aunt Connie Wong who was killed by the kidnappers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#90:1:A>
Remember Rowena Tiu who was kidnapped in La Union
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#91:1:A>
Remember the owner of Liana Supermarket
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#92:1:A>
<.> Re </.> remember the whispers about the kidnapping of a
granddaughter of a big banker and the son of a steel magnate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#93:1:A>
We have taken down the syndicates responsible for kidnapping them
and fifty-two other victims <&> applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#94:1:A>
In the process one hundred seventy kidnappers were either killed or
captured
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#95:1:A>
The ideal response to kidnapping was in the case of Rowena Tiu
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#96:1:A>
She was rescued in eight days the ransom money recovered and her
kidnappers were arrested and are now facing trial
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#97:1:A>
That is why hers was the first but the last kidnapping to take
place in Region one in my administration
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#98:1:A>
I want to smash the other twenty-one syndicates in the same way <&> 
applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#99:1:A>
We are getting a clearer picture of the leadership membership and
area of operations of these syndicates
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#100:1:A>
I now want their linkages and modus operandi
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#101:1:A>
I 'm overseeing how they are being watched tracked and infiltrated
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#102:1:A>
We will start with the two biggest syndicates the Bocala and
Fajardo gangs
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#103:1:A>
I have challenged the <.> P </.> Philippine National Police to
eliminate them within a year <&> applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#104:1:A>
I have told the P N P that they must start with the cleansing of
their own ranks
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#105:1:A>
You remember the front page photographs of that shootout last
Saturday
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#106:1:A>
In the front seat next to the driver was a P N P A P N P Academy
graduate but AWOL from the police force
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#107:1:A>
He was the planner and negotiator of that gang
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#108:1:A>
The rascals among the police disgrace the uniform and
unfortunately paint in the same broad brush the majority who do their duty
well
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#109:1:A>
I salute the men and women of the police who scorned to be bribed
and confiscated five hundred kilograms of <indig> shabu </indig> in Quezon
province last year and caught the biggest fish so far in the drug trade
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#110:1:A>
I salute the men and women who raided the <indig> shabu </indig> 
factories in Batangas Zambales San Juan Varsity Hills and other places
seizing a total of five billion pesos worth of illegal drugs and laboratory
equipment in the largest drug busts ever in our history of crime-fighting <&> 
applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#111:1:A>
Within a month we shall organize the new Dangerous Drugs Board and
the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency which Congress has just created and I
thank Senator Barbers for sponsoring the bill in the Senate <&> applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#112:1:A>
With the drug menace now elevated to the level of a national
security problem and no longer just a police problem I am instructing the
Armed Forces of the Philippines to field military resources for intelligence
and to field soldiers in drug raids in support of civilian law enforcement
 <&> applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#113:1:A>
Drug lords will be treated as enemies of the state <&> applause
 </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#114:1:A>
In this war with the drug trade there will be no compromise and no
quarter not for fear or favor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#115:1:A>
Indeed we are at war at war with the terrorists at war with the
kidnappers at war with the drug lords and we are determined to win decisive
victories on all fronts <&> applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#116:1:A>
The global anti-terrorist coalition is a historical watershed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#117:1:A>
This new global consensus helps us immensely in finally breaking
the cycle of terrorism and criminality
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#118:1:A>
To that end we shall enhance our strategic relationship with the
United States through continuing training exercises to sharpen our <w> 
soldiers' </w> capabilities to move and communicate to fix and finish off
their targets <&> applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#119:1:A>
I am happy to let you know that yesterday we captured the
mastermind of the General Santos bombings that killed and maimed eighty
persons a few months ago <&> applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#120:1:A>
This man that we captured yesterday is considered the number one
expert terrorist-bomber
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#121:1:A>
We cannot afford to lose
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#122:1:A>
Even a stalemate will be a defeat
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#123:1:A>
For what is at stake is our country as a viable proposition in the
world economy and we must be viable if we are to win the most fundamental war
the war against poverty <&> applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#124:1:A>
I ask the newly-elected <indig> barangay </indig> captains to take
an active role in this war to be the frontliners in this fight in your
communities
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#125:1:A>
And as with war in the past so will it be with this war
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#126:1:A>
As commander-in-chief I am taking a direct hand in the war against
the enemies of the Republic <&> applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#127:1:A>
This was how I did it with the Abu Sayyaf leading to the death of
Abu Sabaya
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#128:1:A>
This is how I will do it with the criminal gangs <&> applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#129:1:A>
<indig> Nakasalalay dito ang pamamayani ng ating republika
 </indig> our strong republic
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#130:1:A>
At stake in this war is the very life of society the very
possibility of basic rights and liberties which have been under attack for
too long
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#131:1:A>
The right to work in peace is as basic as the right to life and
liberty and when both are in danger their preservation by all lawful means
becomes not just a higher right but an overriding duty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#132:1:A>
And that duty I will discharge <&> applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#133:1:A>
This is a war we will wage on behalf and with the rage of all the
victims those whose businesses were ruined by extortion those held down by
poverty in fear those whose lives were snuffed out by addiction and those
taken hostage and killed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#134:1:A>
To them I say we shall redeem your pain we shall redeem your loss
 <&> applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#135:1:A>
I endorse to the collective wisdom of Congress with a great sense
of urgency a new bill that will strengthen our legal armory in this war the
Anti-Terrorism Bill <&> applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#136:1:A>
When passed into law this bill will plug the loopholes by which
crimes spread and democracy is undermined
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#137:1:A>
Congress will also note a reallocation of resources in this year 's
budget to enhance the Republic 's crime-fighting capabilities <&> applause
 </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#138:1:A>
There are a number of other critical bills linked closely to the
overall run of social economic and political reform
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#139:1:A>
I will hold more meetings with the Legislative-Executive
Development Advisory Council or LEDAC to push this momentum of reform
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#140:1:A>
We must team up as I said last year to enact a law making farm
land acceptable as loan collateral in order to remove a big deterrent to
investments in agriculture
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#141:1:A>
We must pass the Special Purpose Vehicle Act in order to encourage
asset management companies to put back into productive circulation assets now
tied up in problematic loans
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#142:1:A>
We must pass a law to give overseas Filipinos the right to vote
consistent with the Constitution <&> applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#143:1:A>
We must pass the bill that will give equal respect and recognition
to the overseas Filipino 's dual citizenship consistent with our national
honor <&> applause </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-021#144:1:A>
These are the least return for the enormous contribution of our
overseas Filipinos to the national welfare </I> 1
