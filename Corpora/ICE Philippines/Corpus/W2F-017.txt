<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#3:1>
Flying terrifies me.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#4:1>
But last week I dragged myself by the ears to buy a one-way plane
ticket from Manila to Naga for two reasons: first, because my mother is
celebrating her seventieth birthday today ( next to the Pe&ntilde;afrancia
fiesta, I do not miss my mother 's birthday); and second, because landslides
have blocked off the South Road again. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#5:1>
You heard right: until last week I had never been on a plane.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#6:1>
I had never seen the inside of a plane except in the movies.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#7:1>
In fact, I had never been higher than the top story of the Naga PNB
building.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#8:1>
Even that experience made me airsick for a week.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#9:1>
I know what you 're thinking.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#10:1>
But let me tell you this: sitting on a plane that soars at 16,000
feet is not exactly my idea of travel.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#11:1>
Even a bird does not fly that high.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#12:1>
Maybe heaven is up there somewhere; but I 'm in no hurry to go to
heaven yet. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#13:1>
What 's all this big deal about air travel, anyway?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#14:1>
All the great men and women before <mention> Kitty Hawk </mention>
never got a few feet off the ground--Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Cleopatra,
Taras Bulba--and they got where they were going.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#15:1>
But today, if you say you haven't been on a plane, people snicker.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#16:1>
I have watched commercials of contented passengers dancing and
dining in the <quote> &ldquo; friendly skies &rdquo; </quote> - - the
airlines would do anything to entice you to fly--but to me, they don't mean a
thing.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#17:1>
So what if you can call me a coward.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#18:1>
I 'd rather look foolish than dead.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#19:1>
So what if I never enjoyed a fellowship for overseas study because
none of those silly, smirking exchange program directors approved of my
special requests to travel by sea.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#20:1>
So what if I 'm fifty years old! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#21:1>
Flying is unnatural, <foreign> <it> Chico </it> </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#22:1>
It defies the laws of nature.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#23:1>
It goes against God 's will.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#24:1>
It is suicide, and suicide is a mortal sin.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#25:1>
If God intended us to fly, He 'd have given us wings.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#26:1>
Until today, there was no way anybody could do to get me on a plane
because I had vowed to myself I 'd never fly unless it was a matter of life
and death and the pilot 's family and the Pope were on board the same plane
with me. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#27:1>
Why did I change my mind?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#28:1>
Like I said, it 's my mother 's birthday.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#29:1>
The second reason, however, is a lie: the South Road 's passable
already.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#30:1>
So why am I flying? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#31:1>
It 's the South Road.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#32:1>
You see, for years I always kidded myself that the South Road,
however long it took ( the longer, the better, I 'd chime), was fun.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#33:1>
The bus trip is a vacation itself, I 'd convince my friends.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#34:1>
Your vacation starts the very minute you board the bus.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#35:1>
You meet interesting people on the bus.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#36:1>
The food at the stopovers is great, and you get the chance to treat
yourself to the roadside <indig> <it> lanzones </it> </indig> stands.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#37:1>
Besides, what 's the hurry?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#38:1>
I don't want to arrive at my destination that fast. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#39:1>
The brutal reality, however, is that the fifteen-hour South Road
trips ( if you 're lucky) mean detours, zigzags, lunar craters, smashed up
concrete blocks, broken transmissions, flat tires, your bus or cargo trucks
stuck in the middle of one-way roads under repair.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#40:1>
And since Bicolanos, when they travel, bring the whole house with
them, the brutal reality also means traveling under overhead racks loaded
with sacks of laundry and <foreign> copra </foreign> and cans of biscuits and
boxes of leaking fish sauce. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#41:1>
For years I 'd arrive at my destination weary, bleary-eyed,
unkempt, foul-smelling, beat up from being jammed up for so many hours, my
buttocks flattened, my feet swollen; but I kept kidding myself it was fun all
the way.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#42:1>
Perhaps I got special delight in torturing myself. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#43:1>
What about the train?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#44:1>
I used to take the train, but I stopped because the toilets were very
dirty--as dirty as our national elections.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#45:1>
I think they deliberately make the toilets dirty so passengers would
not use them.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#46:1>
I also stopped taking the train because on one night trip while I was
trying to open a window ( before they permanently grilled them up) to let in
some fresh air, somebody out there--a dead shot--threw shit at the train, and
the passengers ( who were asleep at that time) woke up and thereafter kept
their aesthetic distance from me. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#47:1>
I love coming home because my mother lives in Naga and refuses to
move to Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#48:1>
Not that I have to.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#49:1>
I 'd take every opportunity to come home no matter how long it took
because I, too, love everything about Naga.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#50:1>
Well, almost everything.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#51:1>
I dread Monico 's Naga jokes.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#52:1>
Monico is our family driver and a self-anointed wit and positive
thinker ( if you 're a driver, don't say you 're a driver; say you 're in the
transportation business).

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#53:1>
He 's going to meet me at the airport and &ldquo; educate &rdquo; me
on his &ldquo; music lesson &rdquo; quizzes I heard a thousand times already:
Does music make you happy?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#54:1>
No, it makes Marvin Gay.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#55:1>
Does music make you think?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#56:1>
No, it makes Stevie Wonder.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#57:1>
<indig> <it> Kurne </it> </indig> <&> corny </&> ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#58:1>
Anyway, my strongest reason for flying eclipses all others: I
want to conquer my fear--no, not of flying--of beautiful girls.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#59:1>
You heard me right.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#60:1>
I 'm fifty years old and I 'm still a bachelor.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#61:1>
My friends envy my single-blessedness; they admire my talent in
eschewing the tender trap.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#62:1>
What they don't know is I 'm single because courting girls terrify me
as much as flying.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#63:1>
What 's the connection?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#64:1>
Everything.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#65:1>
You see, when I was in elementary school, I admitted my fear of
flying to my crush.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#66:1>
She guffawed and hooted in my face so lustily I saw her tonsils
vibrate.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#67:1>
Then she turned to her <indig> <it> barkada </it> </indig> , and they
too bent over and howled and shrieked their lungs out the uproar shook the
walls of the <foreign> Colegio de Santa Isabel </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#68:1>
I don't know, but since then, everytime I 'd approach a girl with the
intention of courting, my knees would wobble, my voice would quiver, my jaws
would tighten, my eyes would blink furiously.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#69:1>
I 'm afraid my fear of flying is inextricably linked to my fear of
beautiful girls.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#70:1>
This is the reason why I bought this ticket.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#71:1>
Imagine the sea change I 'd experience, the self-confidence I 'd
exude.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#72:1>
For once, I want to feel like a hero.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#73:1>
I want to be self-confident like, well, Arnold Schwarzenegger. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#74:1>
I once watched a movie where Arnold Schwarzenegger grabbed the
horizontal bars of a plane 's landing gears and hanged on there in mid-air.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#75:1>
Boy, did he impress the girls in Emily Theater!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#76:1>
I want the girls to call me a hero, too, but how can they when I 'm
riddled with phobias?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#77:1>
Somebody jostles me in SM Cubao and I quickly check out my wallet.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#78:1>
I hear a rustle and I 'm sure there 's a burglar downstairs.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#79:1>
I 'm afraid of black cats, open spaces, computers, ladders, and the
number 13.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#80:1>
I 'm allergic to dust, tall buildings, English teachers, bridges,
elevators, born-against <&> this is an intentional pun </&> Christians,
Opposite <foreign> Dei </foreign> <&> a pun on Opus Dei </&> Catholics,
underwriters, work.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#81:1>
I 'm also a hypochondriac.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#82:1>
I 'm afraid my shortness of breath is a symptom of a heart attack.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#83:1>
I 'm afraid my migraine is a symptom of brain tumor.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#84:1>
I 'm afraid these contortions in my stomach are symptoms of cancer.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#85:1>
I 'm afraid of being buried alive. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#86:1>
To think that all these grew out of my fear of flying. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#87:1>
But the die is cast.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#88:1>
So I unplugged all the chords in the office, cleaned up my desk,
donated eggs to the Carmelite Monastery, paid my water and electric bills,
picked up my clothes from the washer-woman, returned all phone calls,
returned the empty soft-drink bottles to the <indig> sari-sari </indig> <&>
variety </&> store that did not charge me for deposit, and, for good measure,
made a quick pilgrimage to Antipolo.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#89:1>
I also bought myself brand new Ray Ban sunglasses for the heroic
look. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#90:1>
Despite the heavy traffic, I finally make it to the Domestic
Airport, so here I am, Ray Ban and all, standing in front of the Departure
Area, in two minds whether or not I should cross the Rubicon.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#91:1>
I look around for reassuring sights, but two things immediately
attract my attention: a sign that tells me to beware of low-lying aircraft (
as if I can do something about it) and an insurance counter that reminds me
there is something unsafe about flying ( why aren't there insurance counters
in bus or train terminals?). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#92:1>
I want to turn back.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#93:1>
But a baggage boy appears from nowhere and threatens to carry my
<foreign> <it> maleta </it> </foreign> ( where were you when I carried my
burden from the gasoline station to this place?), and I avoid him by entering
the main door of the passenger terminal.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#94:1>
Once inside, I show my ticket to the guard ( all right, all right, I 'll
place my luggage on the belt of the X-ray machine, and my attach&eacute; case
too, you don't have to repeat it, I 'm not from Libmanan, you know). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#95:1>
I walk towards the check-in area and weigh-in my <foreign> <it>
maleta </it> </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#96:1>
A uniformed lady attaches a tag around the handle and adheres a
baggage claim stub on my ticket.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#97:1>
I tell her, as confidentially, as discreetly as possible, that I want
a seat as near the emergency exit as possible, and that I want a window side
seat, you know, the usual, I tell her, to impress her that I 'm a regular
flyer here.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#98:1>
I need to look out the window so that I can appreciate the impact of
the crash.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#99:1>
A uniformed male attendant behind her lifts my bag from the weigh-in
counter and throws it in the back.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#100:1>
I worry that these guys might load it on the wrong plane. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#101:1>
Before entering the pre-departure lounge, I show my I.D. and
ticket to the two officers at the counter.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#102:1>
While they 're busy scrutinizing my photo <foreign> sans </foreign>
the sunglasses, I drop a twenty peso bill in the Red Cross can, and the nice
round lady behind it beams at me and says thank you.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#103:1>
A Jesuit priest once told us that no harm can possibly come to a
traveler who donates to the Red Cross. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#104:1>
Once inside the pre-departure lounge, the first thing I notice
is the profusion of No-Smoking signs.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#105:1>
This is the airport 's subtle way of warning us of danger, I assure
myself to slow down my palpitations.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#106:1>
I walk past the doughnut stand but I restrain myself from eating
because fasting is good for the soul.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#107:1>
At the magazine stand, I buy myself the latest copy of <mention>
GRAPHIC </mention> to relax myself, and, boy, do I relax when I read this
well-written feature by a Jesuit-educated, brilliant Catholic thinker who 's
telling me, true to the spirit characteristic of <it> that </it> Society,
that the mysteries of Agoo were not so joyful after all! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#108:1>
Boarding for Naga passengers is at Gate 1, but I sit in front of
Gate 5 outside the medical clinic because I want to have a better view of the
framed picture of the Divine Mercy ( <quote> Jesus, I trust in You, </quote>
I keep repeating the prayer printed below the picture). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#109:1>
Five minutes before boarding time, I go to the men 's room even
if I do not feel like it so I won't have to use the plane 's lavatory.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#110:1>
The pressure up there is so great you could get sucked out of the
toilet bowl, you know. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#111:1>
Suddenly, the yellow light with <mention> NAGA </mention>
written on it and the green light beside it start blinking.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#112:1>
My eyes start blinking along with it as I solemnly rise to join the
queue at Gate 1, my head bowed in resignation.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#113:1>
I take off my Ray Ban.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#114:1>
I don't feel like a hero on Death Row.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#115:1>
I pull out my boarding pass, hand it to the uniformed lady at the
door, and with feet of clay, trek my last mile towards the waiting Fokker 50,
my attach&eacute; case in one hand and a photo of John Paul II in the other.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#116:1>
I see tow tractors pulling baggage trailers and I worry again if
those guys loaded my <foreign> <it> maleta </it> </foreign> in the wrong
plane.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#117:1>
I see water trucks, refueler trucks, boom trucks--how keen our
senses become when we 're on the brink of death--until I walk past the huge
wings of my plane.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#118:1>
What 's this fire extinguisher doing under the steps of the ramp?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#119:1>
My heart is in my throat.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#120:1>
I look at the wings and wheels and wonder admiringly how Arnold
Schwarzenegger did it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#121:1>
We are welcomed by a heavily made up stewardess, and my knees
start wobbling again, so I wear a deadpan face to appear businesslike, and
besides, I do not want to entertain impure thoughts and desires.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#122:1>
Once inside, I see the other stewardess, similarly made up, assist
the other passengers in finding their seats.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#123:1>
I look at one stewardess and the other and I get this impression
that they spend more time on grooming trying to look like Dolores Hart
instead of checking out the safety devices. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#124:1>
I don't like this idea of sitting in this enclosed cabin, all
strapped in.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#125:1>
I feel as if I 'm inside a giant metal toothpaste tube before they
screw the cap on and seal us in.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#126:1>
I scan the passengers as they come in.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#127:1>
This guy looks like that fiend in that Texas chain saw massacre
movie.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#128:1>
Ah, a young mother with her infant, thank God, I hope she sits
beside me.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#129:1>
She does not.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#130:1>
Instead I have this matron who looks like a steroid-addled
body-builder for company.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#131:1>
I see a foreign-looking guy embark.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#132:1>
He 's carrying an attach&eacute; case like mine.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#133:1>
Did they check his hand-carried luggage for plastic explosives?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#134:1>
His eyes appear cloudy.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#135:1>
I think he has something else in mind besides flying to Naga--like
forcing this plane to fly to Libya.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#136:1>
There is a lapse in security around here!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#137:1>
More passengers come in, and I 'm annoyed by the fact that they are
all male.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#138:1>
That 's fine, so long as they don't look like terrorists.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-017#139:1>
Oh they look harmless enough; they only remind me of Bela Lugosi,
Christopher Lee, Peter Lore, Boris Karloff, Peter Cushing, Lon Chaney Jr.,
Vincent Price, Max Schreck. </p> </I>
