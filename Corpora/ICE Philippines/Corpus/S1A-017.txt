<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#157:1:B>
Yes that kid
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#158:1:B>
He he 's yeah I think the reason why the the older guy got the award was that he <{> <[> was old </[>

<[> He was the oldest guy </[> </{>

That 's <.> o </.> okay <indig> lang 'yon </indig> Sir
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#163:1:B>
It it 's uh Mad and Ella and Pacos
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#164:1:B>
You know what Ella said the <.> wh </.> why they will you know they were they gonna graduate <indig> na </indig> this term

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#165:1:A>
Why
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#166:1:A>
What 's the reason

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#167:1:B>
Because Pacos is so old he he better graduate <indig> na </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#168:1:A>
That 's <{> <[> mean </[>

<[> <indig> Kasi </indig> </[> </{> <O> stutters </O>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#170:1:A>
That is so mean

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#171:1:B>
No <O> stutters </O> he was just kidding <indig> kasi parang 'yun </indig> Pacos is what ninety-four ninety-five <&> referring to I D number tied to first year of enrolment </&> like really old now <{> <[> but he 's still here </[>

<[> Uh no </[> </{> it 's okay 'cause you you you you were from computer science so your case is understandable

Why Pacos Pacos is from computer science

 <$B>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#188:1:A>

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#191:1:B>
Okay okay let 's talk about let 's talk about something else okay <&> break in the recording </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#192:1:B>
Okay now we 're gonna talk about something sensible
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#193:1:B>
Go on Louis

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#194:1:A>
What do you think about the Clean Air Act

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#195:1:B>
What 's the Clean Air Act

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#196:1:A>
Okay the Clean Air Act is I think it 's principally authored by Loren Legarda
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#197:1:A>
Actually I saw the <.> deli </.> the deliberations on T V and it was I think five four months ago
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#198:1:A>
The Clean Air Act is all about uhm <,,> removing leaded gasoline from the metropolis
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#199:1:A>
It 's <?> filling </?> out leaded gasoline and favoring unleaded gasoline instead

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#200:1:B>
Is it isn't like unleaded is not really too good for the car

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#201:1:A>
Uhm let 's put it this way it 's not that 's not good for the for old cars but it makes the acceleration slower
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#202:1:A>
But it 's cleaner than leaded fuel

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#203:1:B>
Okay so so what do I think 



<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#> Well if if that 's gonna make the environment better or cleaner or or <.> liv </.> livable well I think yeah I 'm gonna go for it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#204:1:B>
But then oh no you know what we 're gonna talk about <,> death penalty
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#205:1:B>
I love that topic uh as as hard-core Catholic that I am I 'm so for death penalty

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#206:1:A>
I am so for death penalty

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#207:1:B>
You know I mean I 'm not I don't even know why why these uhm like priests and and nuns are lobbying for for for uhm uhm no death penalty

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#208:1:A>
<indig> Hindi </indig> uhm <{> <[> actually </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#209:1:B>
<[> Okay so </[> </{> okay okay

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#210:1:A>
What Sir has been telling us it it makes a whole lot of sense

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#211:1:B>
Which is

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#212:1:A>
The the Bureau of Prisons is called <{> <[> correctional corrections </[> so they 're supposed to be correctional facilities

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#213:1:B>
<[> Yeah Bureau of Corrections but come on </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#214:1:B>
Look at it this way if that was your daughter who was raped would you want the guy to be <.> corr </.> corrected nor rehabilitated
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#215:1:B>
Would you want that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#216:1:B>
No

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#217:1:A>
I wouldn't want that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#218:1:B>
You want them dead A S A P
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#219:1:B>
I 'm sorry

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#220:1:A>
You 're excited

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#221:1:B>
No I mean think about it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#222:1:B>
I mean I 'm a girl and if I was raped do I want him to be corrected I want him killed ahhh
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#223:1:B>
I would want to to inject that injection to him and you know watch him die

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#224:1:A>
I think they have to adjust the conditions wherein they will apply the death penalty

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#225:1:B>
I was thinking

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#226:1:A>
'Cause heinous crimes is is a very broad topic and they should narrow it down to specific topics further

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#227:1:B>
I think what they should do is that you know if if they know that this guy is a repeater repeating offender well I mean you know okay kill him but if if it 's like a first time thing and <,> I don't know I I I no you know what

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#228:1:A>
I think that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#229:1:B>
I take it back uh first time whatever <,,> minor or not you get killed because you you know it 's like this you you expect the the person he she has the right to live too and by doing that you took away that that privilege

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#230:1:A>
I think to solve this problem about the death penalty well first they have to efficiently fund the Bureau of Corrections

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#231:1:B>
Yes yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#232:1:A>
They have to hire decent psychologists psychiatrists

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#233:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#234:1:A>
People who could rehabilitate these people because uhm you could can't go on without saying that these people need help
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#235:1:A>
They need assistance and most of the crimes committed were <.> we </.> were <.> primar </.> were primarily because of uhm uhm tsk <,> what <,> poor parental supervision when they were kids violence within the home or within the household

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-017#236:1:B>
No but then they there are like those kids uh <,> like let 's say Freddie Webb Freddie Webb no the kid you know that he didn't grow up with an abusive father
