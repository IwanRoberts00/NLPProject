The enrolment of Grade 1 pupils during yesterday 's National
School Enrolment Day ( NSED) was generally smooth, orderly, and peaceful,
according to Education Undersecretary Nilo L. Rosas. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#4:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I spoke with a number of regional directors to
assess the status of today 's NSED.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#5:1>
Apparently everything was quite smooth.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#6:1>
The turnout as of yesterday morning was not really big but we 're
hoping that it will be bigger in the afternoon, &rdquo; </quote> said Rosas
at 12:40 p. m. yesterday after a meeting with Education Secretary Bro. Andrew
Gonzalez, FSC. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#7:1>
Rosas also thanked the media and all DECS officials for the
information campaign they have done for the success of the activity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#8:1>
He also said that enrolment in public schools in Quezon City,
Manila, Makati City, Pasig City and other areas in Metro Manila as well as
different cities and towns all over the country were peaceful and orderly.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#9:1>
There were few parents who went to the schools in the morning to
enrol their children, but they are expected to crowd the schools later in the
afternoon, according to Rosas. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#10:1>
Police and military in Mindanao have stepped up security measures
to prevent any untoward incident during yesterday 's NSED, according to
Rosas, undersecretary for programs, projects and regional operations.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#11:1>
He also said local education officials in the area have been
conducting meetings with the police and military to ensure peace and order in
the activity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#12:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Police and military officials in Mindanao have
assured us that the situation there is under control and that security in and
around the schools in Mindanao has been beefed up, &rdquo; </quote> said
Rosas. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#13:1>
<quote> &ldquo; We are confident that there will be a high
turnout in these trouble spots, &rdquo; </quote> said Rosas.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#14:1>
Mindanao has been rocked by a spate of violent incidents over the
past few weeks.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#15:1>
Education officials were even forced to suspend classes in the
affected areas as rebel groups had threatened to bomb schools. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#16:1>
Some 2.6 million children were expected to troop to public
schools nationwide to enlist for Grade 1 this coming school year 1999-2000.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#17:1>
In an earlier statement, Gonzalez said that the early enrolment
of Grade 1 pupils would help the Department of Education, Culture and Sports
( DECS) to determine the number of teachers, classrooms and textbooks needed
for the next school year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#18:1>
Gonzalez said parents who failed to enrol their children
yesterday can still do so during the opening of classes in June.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#19:1>
This, however, is not encouraged. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#20:1>
DECS has been conducting a National School Enrolment Day for the
past few years in an attempt to address the perennial shortage of classrooms
and teachers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#21:1>
In a memorandum by Executive Secretary Ronaldo B. Zamora to all
officials and employees in both the national and local governments, he said
<quote> &ldquo; to ensure greater success in the implementation of this
program, those government workers who intend to enrol their children in Grade
1 in any public school in the country, are hereby authorized to participate
in the fifth NSED on January 25, 1999 and shall not be considered absent from
office, provided they submit to their office heads a certification of such
participation issued by the school official concerned. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<h> <bold> Pre-school classes </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#23:1>
The Department of Education, Culture, and Sports ( DECS) is
opening 1,428 public pre-school classes that will benefit over 42,000
5-year-old children in 20 less privileged areas this school year as part of
the administration 's pro-poor program. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#24:1>
Education Undersecretary and Spokesperson Victor Andres Manhit
said that with the &peso;143-million outlay for the pre-school Education
Program under this year 's General Appropriations Act ( GAA), DECS can
support the 1,428 classes for school year 1999-2000. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#25:1>
At a maximum of 30 pupils per class, an estimated 42,840
pre-schoolers will benefit from the program under the Social Agenda
provinces.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#26:1>
These are Batanes, Aurora, Romblon, Masbate, Antique, Guimaras,
Southern Leyte, Eastern Samar, Biliran, Basilan, Agusan del Sur, Surigao del
Sur, Abra, Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga Apayao, Mt. Province, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#27:1>
Manhit said that from the Congress-approved outlay, &peso;5
million is also appropriated for the supervision of schools, learning
centers, other family-owned institutions and Department of Social Welfare and
Development ( DSWD) day care centers offering pre-school education. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#28:1>
These schools will have to be monitored to ensure that they are
using the curriculum appropriate to 5-year old kids and to check if they are
following the standards of pre-school classes, said Manhit. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#29:1>
DECS further revealed that also included in the provision is the
allocation of &peso;6 million for the implementation of a pilot project on
pre-school education in Region III, particularly in the provinces of Bataan,
Tarlac, and Pampanga. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#30:1>
Another &peso;1 million is appropriated for the training of
pre-school teachers to upgrade their skills and competencies in delivering
quality service.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#31:1>
The bulk of the budget will go to actual operations of pre-schools
and personnel services, said Manhit. </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#34:2>
President Estrada, in a bid for peace and solidarity among
nations in the Asia Pacific region, called on their governments yesterday to
keep communication lines open and break down the walls of silence among
conflicting neighbors to resolve disagreements and disputes in the spirit of
Asian respect and brotherhood. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#35:2>
Walls of silence and narrow lines of communications over crucial
issues even among neighbors keep nations apart, he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#36:2>
In a speech before delegates to the four-day 33rd General
Assembly of the Asian-Pacific Parliamentarians ' Union ( APPU) which opened
yesterday at the Manila Hotel, the President laid out the need among members
in the family of nations to learn from history that resolving issues at the
negotiating table make for peaceful relations between neighbors regardless of
race, color, and creed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#37:2>
<quote> &ldquo; No controversy is too small, or disagreement too
great that it cannot be discussed in a civil manner at the negotiating table,
&rdquo; </quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#38:2>
At the same time, the President appealed to the delegates for
sobriety in keeping track of the goals of the Asian-Pacific Parliamentarians '
Union to uphold the principles of freedom, sovereignty, and territorial
integrity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#39:2>
Respecting borders, like maintaining fences, according to
President Estrada, <quote> &ldquo; make up for good neighbors. &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#40:2>
The parliamentarians ' union was first set-up in Tokyo, Japan in
1965 under the guidelines of member-states ' adherence to democratic
principles. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#41:2>
Mr. Estrada, who was the assembly 's keynote speaker, pointed to
the crucial roles regional legislative leaders can play in pursuing enduring
peace and stability in the region through civil and diplomatic channels. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#42:2>
The Asian legislators ' four-day meet opened with the
participating countries accounting for more than a hundred delegates and
observers who are here to discuss the currency crisis, effects of
globalization, and other issues of mutual regional concern. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#43:2>
Among the Asian countries being represented in the union 's 33rd
General Assembly are the Philippines, China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Fiji,
Malaysia, Nauru, Samoa, and Laos. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#44:2>
Guam and the Commonwealth of the Marianas are associate members
while Vietnam is an observer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#45:2>
President Estrada, at the Manila Hotel forum, also told delegates
that peace and stability are easily within reach if Asian and Pacific
legislative leaders could prevail upon their respective governments to break
the silence that keep nations apart while keeping communication lines open.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#46:2>
Breaking that silence and opening lines of free discussion over
disagreements among neighbors, he said, are effective tools towards achieving
regional peace and unity that can push member states to be competitive with
the rest of the world. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#47:2>
<quote> &ldquo; History has shown us that sitting down at the
negotiating table renders everyone a winner, while in armed confrontations,
somebody ends up a loser, &rdquo; </quote> President Estrada told the
delegates. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#48:2>
Towards the course of his address, President Estrada also spoke
on the need to protect the region 's natural resources as he urged delegates
to draw up a reservoir of stricter policies to protect the environment. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#52:3>
On a day the Centennial Team blew the United Arab Emirates out of the
court and Elma Muros shattered her RP record in heptathlon, the Philippines '
hunt for the elusive gold medal yesterday remained as it is, only a hunt, as
the Filipinos went short of ammunition in the other 13th Asian Games events
here. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#53:3>
The cagers celebrated the birth anniversaries of head coach Tim
Cone and player Zandro &ldquo; Jun &rdquo; Limpot with a 93-57 rout of the
UAE before a wildly cheering throng of Filipino overseas workers and athletes
and the whole Chinese team for an auspicious start in the basketball
quarterfinals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#57:3>
The big victory served as a prelude for Muros ' feat. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#58:3>
The 31-year-old mother of one girl, despite injuring her ankle
when she jumped barefoot in the high jump, broke her Philippine record of
5,269 points with a 5,346-point effort. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#59:3>
But her new standard proved very short in the medal fight as this
was only fifth and last in the event won by Shen Shengfei of China with her
by registering a 5,817 effort. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#60:3>
Muros topped the 100-meter hurdles and 200-meter races but fared
badly in the high jump, triple jump, shot jump, 800-meter run and her
favorite long jump to bow out of the medal race. </p>

Aside from the basketball squad which faces an acid test against
host Thailand at 7 p.m. ( 8 p.m. in Manila) today, only the archers gained

</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#62:3>
Marifi Martinez registered a 12th best score of 1,262 while
Purita Joy Marino, Jennifer Chan and Adelina Figueroa were running 15th, 16th
and 40th, respectively with 1,248, 1,246 and 1,111 points. </p>

Likewise, the men 's squad advanced Oscar Briones ( 25th 1,210),
Christian Cubilla ( 34th 1,161) and Michael Pacundo ( 36th 1,162). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#64:3>
It was silence from the other delegations and their debacles kept
the Philippines down low at 23rd spot in the medal standings with its
collection of three silver medals and seven bronzes. </p>

CAMP SALIPADA K. PENDATUN, Parang, Maguindanao - -

<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#72:4>
The Moro Islamic Liberation Front ( MILF) yesterday appealed to
Philippine National Police chief Deputy Director General Roberto T. Lastimoso
to help defuse the tension here as it assured him of MILF 's commitment to
the peace talks despite recent hostilities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#73:4>
In a letter coursed through Maguindanao Gov. Zacaria A. Candao,
MILF Vice Chairman for Political Affairs Hadji Murad said that the
secessionist group will pursue the peace process despite rising tension in
Buldon, Maguindanao, and will honor the ceasefire agreement. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#74:4>
In response, Lastimosa asked Lt. Gen. Angelo Reyes, Armed Forces
of the Philippines ( AFP) Southern Command chief, to stop the <quote> &ldquo;
saber-rattling and posturing &rdquo; </quote> in Buldon. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#75:4>
Murad also said that although the shelling of MILF positions near
the town would not lead to a fullscale war, an attack on the rebel group 's
main base at Camp Abubakar would. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#76:4>
The past few weeks have seen MILF units and the Army 's 39th
Infantry Brigade trade mortar fire at Buldon.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#77:4>
Although no casualties were reported, the local and national
governments feared these could escalate the fighting. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#78:4>
The MILF is wary of reported massing of Army troops and tanks in
Buldon and Parang, Maguindanao, an indication that the government was
preparing for an offensive on Camp Abubakar. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#79:4>
Buldon Mayor Abolais Manalao appealed to Lastimoso to shore up
the town 's 20 policemen, saying more would help assuage his townspeople 's
anxiety. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#80:4>
Manalao said that additional policemen could protect the people
against MILF attacks. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#81:4>
But Lastimoso, with information from Autonomous Region of Muslim
Mindanao police chief Damming Unga, rejected the mayor 's appeal, saying a
platoon has been sent to monitor the Buldon area under the Quick Response
Team of Fr. Eliseo R. Mercado Jr. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-011#82:4>
Buldon has a population of about 20,000 whose main livelihood is
corn which has been severely affected by the conflict between the 39th
Infantry Battalion and the MILF. </p> </I>
