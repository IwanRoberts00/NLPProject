<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#7:1:B>
No Mr Chief Justice uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#8:1:A>
There you mean there is a mistake in the in the announcement of the Majority Leader

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#9:1:B>
I suppose Mr Chief Justice that it was my senior colleague uh Congressman Apostol who announced the name Joey Tenefrancia
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#10:1:B>
I suppose that he has gotten used to Atty Tenefrancia assisting me in my earlier uh uh examinations and uh he thought that Atty Tenefrancia would also be my assisting counsel today Mr Chief Justice

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#11:1:A>
Make the proper uh correction then of the assisting counsel

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#12:1:B>
Augusto San Pedro Mr Chief Justice

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#13:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#17:1:B>

Now what branches which branches uh in the Philippines if any do you supervise

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#19:1:C>

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#20:1:B>
And these are to be

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#21:1:C>
Makati branch Greenhills the Alabang branch Binondo branch Cebu branch and the Libis branch

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#22:1:B>
And uh yesterday we were on Exhibit <,> septuple septuple F seven F 's and septuple F dash one
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#23:1:B>
Now Mr Witness you were reading uh before the before your testimony was uh <.> termina </.> stopped yesterday suspended yesterday you were reading the machine valid uh machine print out appearing on Exhibit septuple F uh 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#24:1:B>
Can you please read the first line uh the machine print starting with the number one six six for the record please

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#25:1:C>
Uh of a check deposit to Casa Metro check

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#26:1:B>
And then the second line uh

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#27:1:C>
Monday October four uh sixteen forty nineteen ninety-nine

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#28:1:B>
The third line uh Mr Witness

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#29:1:A>
Cannot cannot the counsel read the lines
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#30:1:A>
There had been stipulation on the contents

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#31:1:D>
Your Honor please we have hesitated to make objections but

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#32:1:A>
Do not hesitate if you find <{> <[> somebody </[> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#33:1:D>
<[> We we feel </[> </{> we we feel Your Honor that the these matters that are being asked have already been the subject of stipulation

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#34:1:A>
As a matter of fact the question as to what branches uh has the witness jurisdiction over was testified to yesterday already

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#35:1:D>
That 's correct Mr Chief Justice

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#36:1:A>
<{> <[> Do not forget </[> what had been taken up yesterday so to avoid repetition of questions

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#37:1:B>
<[> Mr Chief Justice </[> </{> yesterday I was not able to ask the specific branches of Citibank under the supervision of the witness

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#38:1:D>
And Mr Chief Justice may we also raise the point that uh up to now there is no basis to ask these questions of the witness considering there that there is as yet no evidence that he participated in the preparation of all these exhibits 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#39:1:D>
That is our point Mr Chief Justice uh there has been no basis laid

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#40:1:A>
The direct testimony is still incomplete

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#41:1:B>
Mr Chief Justice uh Mr Witness uh there is a there are machine prints after the word the name <mention> Ejercito Luisa P </mention> which is not clear in all the copies uh all the photocopies of the original and only you have possession of the original
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#42:1:B>
Would you like to read for the record uh what these uh machine prints are

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#43:1:C>
Okay uhm it 's uhm <mention> With S H I G H Customer List </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#44:1:C>
It stands for <mention> with Standing Hold Instruction Greenhills Customer List </mention> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#45:1:B>
<mention> S H I </mention> means

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#46:1:C>
Standing Hold Instruction Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#47:1:B>
What do you mean by <mention> Standing Hold Instruction </mention> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#48:1:C>
Uh this is our own internal computer tagging system wherein uh an important client is tagged so that uh wherever he or she transacts in any branch would be given uh you know the proper recognition accommodation

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#49:1:B>
And uh the next line is uh if I may read <mention> <.> Philip </.> P H P eight million four hundred thousand </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#50:1:B>
The next line uh reads uh book equal eleven million eight hundred ninety-five thousand one hundred thirty-two and seventeen centavos 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#51:1:B>
<mention> Avail </mention> the word <mention> avail </mention> is equals to three million four hundred ninety-five thousand one hundred thirty-eight and seventeen centavos
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#52:1:B>
Is that correct

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#53:1:C>
Uhm yes Your Honor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#54:1:C>
I also want to qualify that this is uh internal uh copy of the deposit slip
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#55:1:C>
The customer copy does not contain the <mention> book </mention> or the <mention> available </mention> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#56:1:B>
What do you mean by <mention> book </mention> and <mention> available </mention> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#57:1:C>
Uh the <mention> book balance </mention> is the one that is reflected wherein after a check deposit is made the customer cannot withdraw the money yet because the check has not cleared
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#58:1:C>
The <mention> available balance </mention> is the one that the customer can withdraw at any point in time

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#59:1:B>
So does it mean then that at the time the two Metro Bank checks were deposited the account had a had an available balance of three million four hundred ninety-five thousand one hundred thirty-eight and seventeen centavos

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#60:1:C>
Yes Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#61:1:B>
Now the account number in this exhibit septuple F is one six six eight two zero is that correct

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#62:1:C>
Uh yes Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#63:1:B>
And then in the box the name is uh account name is Luisa P Ejercito 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#64:1:B>
Is this correct

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#65:1:C>
Yes Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#66:1:B>
Who filled up uh this information uh Mr Witness

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#67:1:C>
As far as we know uh it is the uh authorized representative of the First Lady

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#68:1:B>
And then uh in the box at the bottom right side of the deposit slip Exhibit septuple F it reads <mention> for internal use only </mention> and then there are markings here
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#70:1:B>
Uh would you like to read these markings for the information of this honorable court

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#71:1:D>
We have to object to these questions Your Honor if the only purpose is to read the entries there

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#72:1:A>
The objection is sustained there had been stipulation on the existence of the documents and the entries thereon
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#74:1:A>
What had been allowed by the Chair uh insofar as some of the questions are concerned would only be some kind of explanation

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#75:1:B>
Yes Mr Chief Justice uh let me re-form then
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#76:1:B>
Uh Mr Witness uh these handwritten uh words seem to read like <mention> with preclearance from </mention> the words the name is no longer legible
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#78:1:B>
Would you like to explain to this honorable court

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#79:1:D>
We have the same objection Mr Chief Justice

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#80:1:A>
It asked for an explanation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#81:1:A>
Witness may answer

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#82:1:C>
Okay uhm I will read first the what 's written
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#83:1:C>
There is a signature of the uh branch manager with a note <mention> with pre-clearance from </mention> our uh compliance officer Ian Fenton and there was a time indicated that around almost five o 'clock four fifty

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#84:1:B>
Who wrote this uh

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#85:1:C>
The branch manager Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#86:1:B>
And his or her name is uh what

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#87:1:C>
Uh Geraldine Nakpil

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#88:1:B>
So these are the handwriting this is the handwriting of Geraldine Nakpil

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#89:1:C>
This this is her handwriting Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#90:1:B>
Okay now uh who is Ian Fenton uh

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#91:1:D>
Immaterial Mr Chief Justice

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#92:1:B>
Mr Chief Justice

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#93:1:D>
These are the subject of stipulations

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#94:1:B>
No Mr Chief Justice

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#95:1:A>
He is only asking for who is the person
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#96:1:A>
Answer

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#97:1:C>
Uh Ian Fenton was the compliance officer at the time of the deposit Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#98:1:B>
Uhm and by compliance officer you 're referring to an officer of the bank that makes sure that the laws applicable and pertaining to that bank are followed

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#99:1:D>
Leading Mr Chief Justice

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#100:1:B>
Is that correct

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#101:1:A>
Sustained

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#102:1:B>
What do you mean by a <mention> compliance officer </mention> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#103:1:D>
Immaterial this this

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#104:1:A>
Sustained

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#105:1:D>
They have no materiality Mr Chief Justice

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#106:1:B>
Could you tell this court uh what the duties are of Ian Fenton as compliance officer

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#107:1:D>
The same objection Mr Chief Justice

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#108:1:A>
Witness may answer

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#109:1:C>
Uhm Ian Fenton was acting as the compliance officer
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#110:1:C>
The compliance officer makes sure that all the guidelines are followed all control processes are followed and uh the the transaction itself uh was done with the right procedures

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#111:1:B>
And by when you mentioned about guidelines you you refer to guidelines including those uh that apply with respect to accounts of substantial amount uh and or accounts maintained by politicians <{> <[> or and </[> public officials and their spouses

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#112:1:D>
<[> Leading </[> </{> leading Mr Chief Justice

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#113:1:A>
Sustained

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#114:1:B>
What are these guidelines uh Mr Witness

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#115:1:D>
We believe these questions are immaterial Mr Chief Justice to the purpose of the offer

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#116:1:A>
Let 's see let 's see uh what would be the materiality later

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#118:1:C>
Okay uhm the guidelines Your Honor you see uh in the bank we establish thresholds for each customer <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#119:1:C>
Depending on the customer certain threshold amount that they deposit creates a trigger that we have to probe the nature of the deposit and the underlined transaction
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#120:1:C>
Like for example an ordinary individual we may set a trigger of let 's say five hundred thousand or one million while probably a businessman who is a big-time businessman we may even set limits of higher ten million or up
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#121:1:C>
So depends on each individual we set triggers for uh monitoring

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#122:1:B>
Do you have thresholds for public officials

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#123:1:D>
Immaterial Mr Chief Justice

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#124:1:A>
Sustained

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#125:1:B>
What thresholds if any do you have with respect to deposits maintained by public officials

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#126:1:D>
The same objection Mr Chief Justice

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#127:1:A>
Sustained <{> <[> <,> </[> for lack of basis 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#128:1:B>
<[> You said </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#130:1:B>
Now Mr Witness you said S H I refers to Special Hold Instruction is that correct
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#132:1:B>
When you say that an account is tagged as S H I and then the letters after that are G H list does this mean Greenhills list

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#133:1:C>
Yes Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#134:1:B>
When an account is tagged does that mean that an account officer or an officer of the bank takes care focuses on that particular account

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#135:1:D>
Leading Mr Chief Justice

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#136:1:A>
Sustained

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#137:1:B>
What does that mean when an account is tagged as ace S H I

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#138:1:D>
The question is immaterial Mr Chief Justice

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#139:1:A>
Overruled
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#140:1:A>
Witness may answer

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#141:1:C>
Uh S H I means uh there could be special instructions there could be hold instructions
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#143:1:C>
So it could be any series of instructions that we put on the customer memo so that when a customer comes to any branch it will be followed

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#144:1:B>
In this particular case the deposit of Mrs Luisa P Ejercito the First Lady who is that officer that handles this account <{> <[> <,> </[> of Citibank 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#145:1:D>
<[> I don't think that would be material </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#147:1:D>
I don't think that would be material Mr Chief Justice

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#148:1:A>
The uh since it is not a an unqualified objection it it is overruled

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#149:1:D>
We have to object we have to object Your Honor on the ground that the question is immaterial

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#150:1:A>
Overruled

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#151:1:C>
The uh account officer is Marivic Pantaleon

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#152:1:B>
Thank you Mr Witness <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#153:1:B>
Is <.> Mar </.> Marivic Pantaleon still the account officer <{> <[> <,> </[> if she is

<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#155:1:B>
I I withdraw that question Mr Chief Justice
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#156:1:B>
Anyway we will find that out in due time
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#157:1:B>
Let me bring you now to exhibit

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#158:1:A>
Avoid avoid immaterial uh <,> avoid some uh objections based on immateriality so you can go and move faster

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#159:1:B>
I want to

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#160:1:A>
I know you can do that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#161:1:B>
Yes Mr Chief Justice but it seems to me that uh-uh my esteemed colleague in the profession Atty <.> Flami </.> Flaminiano is so sensitive to these instruments

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#162:1:A>
No it is not sensitivity <{> <[> <,> </[> I guess we try to save time 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#163:1:D>
<[> If Your Honor please </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#165:1:B>
Yes Mr Chief Justice

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#166:1:A>
Go direct to the point

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#167:1:B>
Exhibit septuple F dash four uh and Exhibit I 'm sorry uh and the submarked uh items marked Exhibit septuple F dash two and septuple F dash three
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#168:1:B>
This is a microfilm copy of the check drawn by issued by Governor Luis Chavit Singson dated August twenty <,> September twenty-nine nineteen ninety-nine for eight million payable to cash and uh signed by him
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#169:1:B>
Now on Exhibit septuple F dash three at the right side of this check numbers appear one six six eight two zero
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#170:1:B>
Can you please explain to this honorable court what these numbers mean

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#171:1:D>
Mr Chief Justice these are the subject of our stipulations

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#172:1:A>
Not covered by the stipulation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#173:1:A>
The witness may answer
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#174:1:A>
It is trying to explain an entry there

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#175:1:C>
Okay uh it is bank practice that we always ensure that the account number is written at the back of the check to make sure that it is uh you know if there is uh audit trail that shows that where the check is being credited to
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#176:1:C>
Just in case there are returns or are there are problems with the check we know where the account uh where the check belongs to Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#177:1:B>
And whose account is this one six six eight two zero

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#178:1:D>
That has been admitted Your Honor

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#179:1:A>
Admitted already in the stipulation

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#180:1:D>
Stipulations yes

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#181:1:B>
Mr Chief Justice uh the next question then is since the check was deposited to this account were the proceeds of this check credited to this account

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#182:1:D>
<{> <[> The answer is very obvious </[>

<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#186:1:D>
For being immaterial and for lack of basis

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#187:1:A>
Overruled because of the grounds invoked

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#188:1:C>
Uh yes Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#189:1:B>

<ICE-PHI:S1B-066#191:1:C>
It was credited Your Honor
