First of all let me assure you that my speech will not be as long as the Manila Declaration <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#4:1:A>
Having just returned from a hectic series of visits to the United Kingdom Oman and Greece all in just nine days it truly is an energizing event to be in this distinguished company back here at home in the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#5:1:A>
<X> In fact I still have the dust of the Acropolis in my shoes because I came directly from <unclear> word </unclear> <,> but one thing I learned from our short visit to Greece the cradle of democracy and the home of ancient civilization which still influences us to this day <unclear> word </unclear> higher education we must make sure that education does not go to our heads but to our minds <indig> di ko yata naintindihan yun 'a </indig> <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#6:1:A>
<?> Translating </?> education is okay </X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#7:1:A>
This gathering of many of the world 's leading educators and human resource development executives both in the public and in the private sector is indeed a great honor for us 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#> Your dialogues discussions papers resolutions and declarations reflect the anticipation of the global community of a new era of greater interaction cooperation and benefit among the eminent personalities and academic institutions represented here and on a larger scale the various stakeholders in the worldwide knowledge society including the children after us
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#9:1:A>
Our common quest for peace and prosperity has been accelerated by the advancement of telecommunications linking communities across the globe and overcoming the economic and cultural barriers among and between peoples the world over
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#10:1:A>
Such a form of networking my dear friends among human societies has made possible the greater integration of knowledge and the exchange of cultural and technological information enabling people to make better decisions from a wider range of options
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#11:1:A>
Our shared aspirations for a better world have led to the development of new modes of cooperation not only among governments but also among subcultures within our societies
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#12:1:A>
International networks have become significant not only for the exchange of information but more so as mechanisms for <.> cooperat </.> cooperative action and policy formulation and advocacy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#13:1:A>
<?> We 're seeing </?> the opportunities for subcultures and remote communities to learn and act across traditional national and ethnic boundaries
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#14:1:A>
These networks represent the strength of hitherto unconnected communities asserting now the right to participate in policy decisions affecting their futures 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#15:1:A>
All over the world these opportunities have become challenges in many forms and they have manifested themselves in the hard decisions that lie before our educators and educational managers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#16:1:A>
<unclear> words </unclear> teachers for example have been called upon to be more efficient more relevant more forward-looking and more learner-focused 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#17:1:A>
At the same time we need to deal with such issues as sustainable development quality and excellence equal opportunity human rights integration of technology and the cultural content of learning as evidenced by uh your reports and your compendiums which I received by fax even while I was abroad
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#18:1:A>
There is a growing universal concern that higher education has found it harder to keep its traditional position at the forefront of human resource and national development
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#19:1:A>
Higher education in most countries including the Philippines is in some kind of crisis and this has been brought about by the rapid increases in enrollment and the declining capacity of governments to sustain budgetary support to higher educational institutions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#20:1:A>
Education is clearly under pressure to respond to changing global economic and social conditions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#21:1:A>
It has had to reengineer and take advantage of information technology to globalize and decentralize in the same manner that corporations have to do
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#22:1:A>
Indeed as some experts suggest transnational education may be the logical outcome of as well as a primary factor in the intensification of global interconnectedness
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#23:1:A>
Furthermore education should increasingly be viewed as a commodity to be shaped according to consumer demand
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#24:1:A>
This perception of education as a market product or service provider creates a new focus on the requirements of the students and the job market thus enabling <w> students' </w> preferences to be embedded into the learning environment and given top priority
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#25:1:A>
Under this scenario educators just like businessmen need to be more flexible and overcome the structural rigidities of traditional institutions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#26:1:A>
For teachers as well as learners this raises important and fundamental questions challenges and choices
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#27:1:A>
For instance what is education about
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#28:1:A>
How is it best delivered and by whom and who pays the bills and how can they be reduced without sacrificing quality
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#29:1:A>
This international congress must address these three questions alongside such vital issues as assuring excellence and quality the roles of universities and colleges in the twenty first century new leadership roles cost effective resource management borderless learning mechanisms application of multimedia technologies modalities of financing higher education institutions internationalization of higher education and mutual recognition and comparability of credentials
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#31:1:A>
Governments all over the world have adjusted with varying degrees of commitment to the challenge of survival and relevance of higher education institutions and are doing what they can to provide sustain if not increase support
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#32:1:A>
These are solid steps forward but we all need to do more
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#33:1:A>
Recent and comprehensive studies suggest that if higher education has to rethink its mission then it must be with the social environment defined by political democratization economic globalization regional trade agreements social and regional polarization <?> discrimination </?> of various social groups and cultural fragmentation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#34:1:A>
We are all urged to review and to reform existing structures and practices in higher education where necessary
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#35:1:A>
Accepting the challenge of sustainable development for example will imply that higher education institutions must reexamine their relationships to the economy and to social realities their organizational structures and their funding and spending modalities
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#36:1:A>
Developing countries in particular face the dual challenges of improving their human resources and reducing poverty levels
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#37:1:A>
In this context higher education and research are seen as extremely important factors in development policy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#38:1:A>
Higher education and human resources development in the Asia Pacific for the twenty-first century are critical concerns which were addressed not too long ago by leaders of eighteen member economies in the Asia Pacific region during the APEC Summit hosted by the Philippines last November nineteen ninety-six
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#39:1:A>
At that historic gathering the leaders renewed their commitment to enriching the lives and to improving the standards of living of all citizens in the Asia Pacific region on a sustainable basis and this world congress brings the effort yet another step forward
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#40:1:A>
In the Asia Pacific governments have supported the closer integration of education research and development and information technology and the strategies that go with it with the requirements of the globalizing economy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#41:1:A>
Many Southeast Asian countries have indicated in concrete terms the levels of investment they are willing to commit to these activities
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#42:1:A>
We can anticipate that before the century turns massive new investments shall have been made in enriching and sharpening our people 's skills and talents
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#42:1:A>
The mutual recognition of skills qualifications and standards of professional practice has been a continuing top priority concern of the APEC working group on human resources development
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#43:1:A>
Here in the Philippines as you already know we have created the Commission on Higher Education CHED and the Higher Education Development Fund H E D F to undertake whatever reforms may be necessary to bring our standards over time up to par with the world 's best learning institutions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#44:1:A>
This surge is what we envisage for the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#45:1:A>
We have adopted what we call our pole-vaulting strategy to diminish the gap between ourselves and our more prosperous neighbors and then to move ahead
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#46:1:A>
Central to this strategy will be the establishment of the Philippines as an education and knowledge center in the Asia Pacific
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#47:1:A>
I like to add the objectives also of making the Philippines a maritime power and a medical center in East Asia among others
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#48:1:A>
These are just some of the competitive niches that we have identified for ourselves in the global economy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#49:1:A>
This means capitalizing on and optimizing our basic strengths and distinct advantages our open society our archipelagic setting and strategic location astride the two great oceans of commerce the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea our adaptable workforce and our strength in services such as information technology or knowledge-based <unclear> words </unclear> enterprises
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#50:1:A>
We must give the highest priority to intensifying and speeding up reforms that free the market to prepare the ground for faster and sustained economic growth and social development
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#51:1:A>
But to attain global excellence in our chosen niches we must emphasize and encourage innovation by promoting a culture of creativity productivity and excellence in both the public and the private sectors
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#52:1:A>
We must set for ourselves the specific objectives that are high enough to be meaningful and should stand out as ambitious even among the East Asian tiger economies
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#53:1:A>
That is why for our pole-vaulting strategy we in the Philippines have chosen the Olympic motto <foreign> citius fortius altius </foreign> faster stronger and higher
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#54:1:A>
In all of this we place the highest value on education which we realize has always been one of our strongest resources
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#55:1:A>
Thus this Congress is a great source of interest and inspiration for all of us
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#56:1:A>
Judging by the superior quality of the papers presented <O> cough </O> and the number of declarations to which you have agreed in this Congress I have no doubt my dear friends that you have <unclear> words </unclear> more significant <,> contributions to mankind 's search for new knowledge and the attainment of the true potentials of the individual
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#57:1:A>
I am extremely pleased to know that at this congress various memoranda of agreement and understanding were reached between and among Ministries of Education in countries such as Canada Thailand and others with our Philippine Commission on Higher Education
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#58:1:A>
These agreements should enable our colleges and universities to cooperate and work more easily and more fruitfully with one another
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#59:1:A>
In closing let me also commend the Congress organizers for bringing together in Manila the Ministers of Education the presidents of leading universities in the world and the most eminent experts on human resource development
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#60:1:A>
In behalf of our people and our government I thank you all for your support and selfless efforts towards enriching the minds and the futures of all our peoples and of humankind as a whole
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#61:1:A>
Thank you
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-050#62:1:A>
