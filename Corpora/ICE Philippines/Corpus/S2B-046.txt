<O> Applause </O> Thank you
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#2:1:A>
Thank you very much
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#3:1:A>
Secretary Filemon Dr Filemon Uriarte Jr our Secretary of the Department of Science and Technology the President of the National Academy of Science and Technology Dr Perla Santos-Ocampo His Excellency William Charles Waters New Zealand Ambassador to the Philippines Senior Economic Adviser Mr Jaime Augusto Zobel Deputy Director and General <,> General Manager of National Economic and Development Authority Mr Rafael Lotilla our very distinguished guests National Artist for Rural Sociology Dr Gelia Castillo President of the Ateneo de Manila University Reverend Fr Bienvenido Nebres former Congressman Dondon Bagatsing this conference foreign speakers and guests led by Mr Jucom Park President Korean Institute of Science and Technology my other co-workers in government other distinguished guests friends ladies and gentlemen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#4:1:A>
At the outset I would like to congratulate the Department of Science and Technology for successfully organizing this timely conference and spearheading the promotion of a knowledge economy in the country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#5:1:A>
This initiative comes at a time when globalization is integrating the world 's countries together when the international economic order is evolving into a highly integrated and electronically dynamic system and when information can be accessed in all corners of the globe at the click of a mouse
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#6:1:A>
Indeed the world today is rapidly moving towards a new economy a knowledge economy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#7:1:A>
It is therefore not surprising that the publication The Economist has asked in big bold letters on its cover Who Owns the <.> Know </.> Knowledge Economy 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#8:1:A>
It however provided the answer Nobody Owns It 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#9:1:A>
Everybody benefits from it and the world becomes richer
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#10:1:A>
This can be illustrated with a simple example
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#11:1:A>
When I share a piece of cake with you you gain the cake and I lose it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#12:1:A>
But when I share my knowledge with you you gain it but I do not lose it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#13:1:A>
In fact both of us may even gain more knowledge from the exchange
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#14:1:A>
Knowledge is essential for our development and in a knowledge economy it is the generation and use of knowledge that assume the significant contribution in the creation of wealth and <.> i </.> in the alleviation of poverty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#15:1:A>
In its recent report the World Bank emphasized that if we want to live better tomorrow than today if we want to raise our living standards as a household or as a country we must do more than simply transform more resources for resources are <.> scare </.> scarce
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#16:1:A>
We must use those resources in ways that generate even higher returns to our efforts and investments
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#17:1:A>
One of the most important enabling tools for the development of a knowledge economy is Information and Communications Technology or I C T
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#18:1:A>
Of the many technologies that are currently being developed and utilized I believe I C T will be the single most important technology that will bring about a knowledge economy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#19:1:A>
The reason for this is that I C T is an enabling technology
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#20:1:A>
Like electricity which is also an enabling technology the impact on the economy is not so much in its production though this can also be significant but in its widespread use and application
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#21:1:A>
Just as the development of electricity developments in I C T bring about new markets new products and new services these in turn bring with them new sources of revenues that contribute to economic growth
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#22:1:A>
Personal computers have grown threefold between nineteen ninety-two and nineteen ninety-seven to one hundred twenty million and are increasingly linking the world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#23:1:A>
In nineteen ninety-three there were about two million Internet hosts worldwide
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#24:1:A>
In nineteen ninety-nine this has increased exponentially to nearly forty-five million
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#25:1:A>
The Internet 's explosive growth is making possible many economic opportunities which just a few years ago were inconceivable
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#26:1:A>
In nineteen ninety-seven the worldwide market for I C T amounted to one point eight trillion or approximately six percent of the world G D P
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#27:1:A>
This is forty percent higher than the level in nineteen ninety-two
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#28:1:A>
It grew by about twenty-seven percent annually between ninety-two and ninety-seven more than five times the rate of global economic growth
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#29:1:A>
For a country like the Philippines it is clear that a knowledge-based development can and should be pursued
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#30:1:A>
The Philippines is an excellent position to harness the potentials of a knowledge economy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#31:1:A>
We are a small country prone to natural disasters whose land areas amounts to less than that of Malaysia Thailand or Indonesia and which is spread over seven thousand islands making the transport of goods very challenging
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#32:1:A>
Our greatest asset therefore is not land or natural resources
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#33:1:A>
Our greatest asset is our people who are imbued with a culture of education and a love for learning
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#34:1:A>
We have been <.> bless </.> blessed with a large number of highly trained and highly trainable people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#35:1:A>
And since knowledge rests on people we have the basic ingredient on which to build a K economy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#36:1:A>
This is further confirmed by the performance of the I C T industry in the country in recent years
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#37:1:A>
In the hardware sector our semi-conductor and electronics industry has been growing at the rate of thirty percent to forty percent per annum since nineteen ninety-three
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#38:1:A>
Products worth nearly twenty billion dollars constituted seventy-two percent of our total exports in nineteen ninety-eight
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#39:1:A>
Exports rose to twenty-five billion dollars in nineteen ninety-nine and is expected to grow to over forty-seven billion dollars in year two thousand four
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#40:1:A>
The five hundred twelve companies involved in the industry have a total investment of over seven billion dollars and employ over two hundred eighty thousand skilled and semi-skilled workers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#41:1:A>
This same trend is mirrored in the software network sectors of the I C T industry in the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#42:1:A>
Many companies have established back-office operations in the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#43:1:A>
America Online for instance operated a customer e-mail response system at Clark Field
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#44:1:A>
Some six hundred Filipinos manning workstations in the Philippines answer e-mails for A O L from all over the globe on a twenty-four hour basis
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#45:1:A>
In short we are in a position to capitalize on our strengths and pursue a knowledge-based development and so far the demand from the I C T industry has fueled in
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#46:1:A>
However it is equally clear that we must do more
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#47:1:A>
These same global I C T trends are calling us to be proactive or otherwise lose our competitive advantage and be further left behind
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#48:1:A>
In view of the tremendous opportunities and vast potentials offered by I C T and other knowledge-based industries we have adopted a key development strategy the transformation of the country into a knowledge center in Asia by the first decade of the twenty-first century
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#49:1:A>
The strategy calls for the exploitation of our potentials as a nation to become a major regional hub for research and development for knowledge-based technologies and as a major production platform for I T based products and services
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#50:1:A>
Through Executive <.> Num </.> Number <.> Or </.> through Executive Order Number One Two Five which I issued last July nineteen nineteen ninety-nine I have endorsed the national Information Technology plan for the twenty-first century or I T twenty-one as our plan of action to guide our efforts in harnessing informations and communications technology for our global competitiveness
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#51:1:A>
I T twenty-one clearly sets our vision of becoming a knowledge center in Asia by the first decade of this century
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#52:1:A>
But from the time we have promulgated I T twenty-one so much has changed and new developments have evolved
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#53:1:A>
That is why I am now directing the National Information Technology Council to review the plan in the light of these changes and new developments
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#54:1:A>
I would especially want to see the wider and more effective use of I C T in government particularly in ensuring faster delivery of public services as well as transparency in government operations and transactions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#55:1:A>
For us to be able to partake of the many opportunities offered by the knowledge economy we have to build on our own strengths and overcome our weaknesses and the opportunities are manifold substantial and increasing spending worldwide particularly in Asia
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#56:1:A>
We see a fast-growing global market and the Philippines is poised to claim a bigger share of this global market
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#57:1:A>
Hence I have directed the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of Science and Technology to work together to make sure our country 's actions are demand-driven strategic coordinated and dynamic
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#58:1:A>
The D T I under the stewardship of Secretary Mar Roxas has taken a number of bold steps to keep our industries competitively linked to the global market generate global demand for our I C T and services and help prepare our people for the jobs of tomorrow
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#59:1:A>
First and most importantly I have directed Secretary Roxas to consolidate the number of dispersed E commerce efforts of the national government under a reactivated and expanded E commerce promotion council of which he is chair
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#60:1:A>
Foremost on their agenda is to fulfill their mandate to formulate and coordinate the implementation of a national program and strategy for the promotion of E commerce in the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#61:1:A>
I expect Secretary Roxas to submit this plan by the end of June
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#62:1:A>
Even as this consolidation effort is taking place however immediate concerns cannot be put on hold
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#63:1:A>
Thus we have updated investment policies and undertaken promotional activities in order to keep the Philippines as the preferred location for I T related and enabled services
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#64:1:A>
Given the present competition for investments we must ensure that we maintain our <.> attract </.> attractiveness as an investment site or run the risk of being overlooked or sidelined by investors
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#65:1:A>
Among the initiatives are first the development of I T Parks
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#66:1:A>
I have approved three so far namely the Eastwood Cyber Park in Quezon City the Northgate Cyber Park Zone in Alabang and the Fort Bonifacio Silicon Alley I T Park in Fort Bonifacio Taguig where competitive fiscal and non-fiscal incentives are offered
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#67:1:A>
A Software Development Park has also been established at the Subic Economic Zone and the Ayala Group has announced the proposed development of an I T Park in Cebu
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#68:1:A>
Second the explicit inclusion of professional I T services in the investment priority plan for fiscal year two thousand
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#69:1:A>
This means that I T related activities will enjoy prime incentives from the Board of Investments
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#70:1:A>
Third the launching of a series of focused I T investment missions to to the United States Korea Japan Europe and Australia which will promote the Philippines as the I T service hub in Asia
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#71:1:A>
Secretary Roxas is in fact in the United States for this very purpose and is scheduled to meet with a number of potential investors locators and out sources
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#72:1:A>
Fourth the creation of an I C T innovation and development fund to provide venture capital for I C T business start-ups and support for I C T research
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#73:1:A>
The National Development Corporation under the D T D T I has already identified I T as a priority and is exploring mechanisms to reach <.> tech </.> techno-entrepreneurs
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#74:1:A>
Finally I T related activities have been highlighted under the proposed amendments to the Omnibus Incentives Act
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#75:1:A>
Our legislators <.> anti </.> anticipate that these amendments will take effect by the third quarter of this year and will feature a number of non-fiscal incentives to match if not surpass that offered by others in the region
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#76:1:A>
So on this note I am happy to announce that the legal framework for our country 's participation in electronic commerce is also around the corner with the passage in the senate of the E Commerce Bill
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#77:1:A>
The bill defines our policies on electronic transactions and will enable us to participate actively in this global trend for trade and commerce
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#78:1:A>
I would like to thank Senators Ramon Magsaysay Blas Ople Juan Flavier and <,> Vicente Sotto for co-authoring this bill 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#79:1:A>
A national program for strategy for the promotion of E-commerce and a knowledge economy is premised on the capability to acquire and adopt global knowledge while creating knowledge locally
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#80:1:A>
The implementation of a rational technology policy which can integrate human and technological capabilities in productive ways is indispensable
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#81:1:A>
We will need to invest heavily in human capital in innovation and more importantly in enabling technologies that facilitate the transfer of knowledge
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-046#82:1:A>
The Department of Science and Technology under the leadership of Secretary Filemon Uriarte Jr is at the forefront of this effort
