Year two thousand Commission Chair Amable Aguiluz says he is ready to face all accusations being thrown at him
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-001#20:1:A>
According to Aguiluz 's legal counsel Attorney Luis Pangulayan there is no basis for the allegation that Aguiluz has been receiving a payola from private companies
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-001#21:1:A>
Pangulayan also denied the Millennium Solutions Corporation which has been selling Y two K solutions to private companies is a dummy corporation under Aguiluz
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-001#22:1:A>
The said corporation is part of the AMA Group of Companies which is owned by the Aguiluz family
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-001#23:1:A>
Aguiluz for his part says it is impossible for a conflict of interest to exist since he has divested himself of all responsibility and ownership in the AMA Group of Companies ever since he assumed the chairmanship of the Y two K Commission
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-001#24:1:A>
