<p> <it>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#4:1>
The functional responses of three co-existing nearshore mysid shrimps
were analyzed using two branchiopodan and one copepodan prey types.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#5:1>
<foreign> <bold> Paramesopodopsis rufa </bold> </foreign> was the most
efficient predator of the euryhaline daphniid prey, <foreign> <bold>
Daphniopsis australis </bold> </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#6:1>
It showed a steeper linear functional responses curve for this prey
than the other two species, <foreign> <bold> Tenagomysis tasmaniae Anisomysis
mixta australis </bold> </foreign> , which showed similar flat linear curves.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#7:1>
All three species exhibited similar predation success on <foreign>
<bold> Artemia </bold> sp. nauplii </foreign> , and similar predation failure
for the calanoid copepod <foreign> <bold> Gladioferens pectinatus </bold>
</foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#8:1>
The study provides evidence that differences in predatory feeding
behaviour support feeding niche segregation which in turn explains the
co-occurrence of the three mysid species. </it> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#9:1>
<h> <bold> Introduction </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#10:1>
Predatory feeding behaviour in many zooplanktonic species of both
freshwater and marine habitats is a complex system which requires a more
detailed study to elucidate its intricacies ( Kerfoot, 1980; Price, 1988;
Ohman, 1988; Gliwicz & Pijanowska, 1989).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#11:1>
These reviews noted that success of predatory species, as those
equivalent systems in the terrestrial environment, is influenced by several
factors.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#12:1>
There seems to be an optimum prey size in which a predator of a
certain size may be efficient.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#13:1>
However, other factors such as body pigmentation, shape,
palatability, motion and escape manoeuvres have been also known to determine
vulnerability of prey to various zooplanktonic predators ( Ohman, 1988;
Gliwicz & Pijanowska, 1989). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#14:1>
Predatory feeding of both freshwater and marine species of mysids
include a variety of animal prey types ( Mauchline, 1980; Morgan, 1982).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#15:1>
The well studied freshwater species, <it> <foreign> Mysis relicta
</foreign> </it> has been known to feed mainly on cladocerans, daphniids
primarily ( Lasenby <it> <foreign> et al. </foreign> </it> 1986); although it
can also prey upon diaptomid calanoid copepods ( Cooper & Goldman, 1980).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#16:1>
Other freshwater species, <foreign> e.g </foreign> . <it> <foreign>
Neomysis mercedis </foreign> </it> ( Murtaugh a,b 1981), <it> <foreign> N.
intermedia </foreign> </it> ( Hanazato, 1990), <it> N. integer </it> ( Bremer
and Vijverberg, 1982), and <it> <foreign> Mysis mixta </foreign> </it> (
Hansson <foreign> et al. </foreign> , 1990) also prefer daphniid prey.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#17:1>
Species that are found in the estuarine and/or marine habitats, on
the other hand, have been reported to consume benthic harpacticoid copepods (
<it> <foreign> N. integer </foreign> </it> , Mauchline, 1971), and calanoid
copepods ( <it> <foreign> N. integer </foreign> </it> , Siegfried and
Kopache, 1980; <it> <foreign> N. americana </foreign> </it> , <it> <foreign>
Mysidopsis bigelowi </foreign> </it> , Fulton, 1982; <it> <foreign> M.
gibbosa, M. didelphys, M. angusta </foreign> </it> , Mauchline 1970).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#18:1>
<it> <foreign> Artemia sp. nauplii </foreign> </it> have also been
used as food to various mysid species, e. g. <it> <foreign> Metamysidopsis
elongata </foreign> </it> , Clutter and Theilacker, 1971; <it> <foreign>
Mysidopsis almyra </foreign> </it> , Reitsema and Neff, 1980; <it> <foreign>
Anisomysis sp. </foreign> </it> , Mullin and Roman 1986). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#19:1>
These zooplanktonic prey species vary in escape behaviour, size,
pigmentation, swimming behaviour and other behavioural characteristics, and
hence, their vulnerability to mysid predation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#20:1>
Different mysid species vary in size and overall predatory feeding
behaviour which are also highly likely to influence rates of predation on the
various prey types.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#21:1>
The present study examines the effect of various prey types, sizes
and behavioural repertoires ( swimming behaviour and escape response) on the
function responses of the three coexisting mysids species, <it> <foreign>
Paramesopodopsis rufa </foreign> </it> Fenton, <it> <foreign> Tenagomysis
tasmaniae </foreign> </it> Fenton, and <it> <foreign> Anisomysis mixta
australis </foreign> </it> Zimmer, in neritic waters off Tasmania. </p>

<h> <bold> Experimental Animals </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#24:1>
Field collection and maintenance in the laboratory of mysids and
the daphniid prey, <it> <foreign> Daphniopsis australis </foreign> </it> ,
are described in detail by Metillo and Ritz ( 1993).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#25:1>


<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#26:1>
Mature cysts of <it> <foreign> Artemia </foreign> </it> sp. (
Artemia Revolution, New Technology Kent, England) were hatched in the
laboratory at 24 &degree; C water temperature and 400/oo salinity.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#27:1>
Two day old metanauplii were used in the predation experiments. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#28:1>
Adult <it> <foreign> Gladioferens pectinatus </foreign> </it>
were collected from six locations in the Derwent Estuary at a depth of either
1 m or 20 m using a 300 m mesh conical net.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#29:1>
In the laboratory, these animals were kept in 50-litre plastic tubs
containing seawater from the sampling area.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#30:1>
At the time of collection, a large bloom of <it> <foreign>
Coscinodiscus wailesii </foreign> </it> occurred.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#31:1>
Buckets of these diatoms were collected and placed into the copepod
tubs to serve as food.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#32:1>
During the entire period of the experiment, the tubs with food and
copepods were gently aerated, and kept at ambient temperature ( 15&dgree; C),
and at constant ambient salinity of 340/oo. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#33:1>
All feeding experiments were performed simultaneously with each
of the three mysid species held separately.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#34:1>
The predation chamber was made of a 2-litre glass jar, wrapped
entirely with black electrical tape to block any light, and filled to the
brim with 5 um Millipore-filtered seawater.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#35:1>
This chamber was covered with a tightly fitting black lid, placed
onto a plankton &ldquo; roller &rdquo; and allowed to rotate at 0.83 + 0.02
SD rpm.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#36:1>
The design of the chamber ensured the absence of refuges such as the
surface film and prevented prey congregating due to uneven light
distribution.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#37:1>
The prey were individually pipetted into the chamber to give
densities of 5, 10, 15, 20 litre <sp> - 1 </sp> for <it> <foreign> D.
australis </foreign> </it> and <it> <foreign> G. pectinatus </foreign> </it> .
Treatment densities of <it> <foreign> Artemia </foreign> </it> metanauplii
were 7.5, 15, 30, and 45 litre <sp> - 1 </sp> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#38:1>
All of these prey densities were replicated four times.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#39:1>
Feeding time which lasted for 2 hours started when four unstarved
adult mysids was introduced into the chamber.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#40:1>
At the end of the predation period, the contents of the chamber were
emptied into plastic buckets.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#41:1>
Predator and prey were removed and killed by placing them in vials
containing 5% ( v/v) buffered formalin in seawater.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#42:1>
From these preserved samples, predator total lengths and the number
of remaining prey were determined.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#43:1>
Prey total lengths were measured from the control jar individuals.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#44:1>
No prey mortality was observed in the control jars, thus any missing
prey from the experimental predation chambers were recorded as captures.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#45:1>
Since the three species of mysids consume their zooplanktonic prey in
its entirety, ingestion/predation rates were expressed as number of prey
mysid <sp> - 1 </sp> hour <sp> - 1 </sp> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#46:1>
Stomachs were dissected out to verify fullness and confirm that
missing prey could be attributed only to ingestion. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#47:1>
<h> <bold> Statistical Analysis </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#48:1>
The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis single factor analysis of
variance ( ANOVA) was computed to test the null hypothesis that predation (
=ingestion) rates between prey densities ( treatments) were equal, while
treatment means were compared using the non-parametric Q test statistic for
multiple comparison for unequal number of data with tied ranks ( Zar, 1984).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#49:1>
The functional response curves of the three mysid species were
described from the relationship between ingestion rate and prey density.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#50:1>
Curve fitting was performed using linear regression with replication,
and slopes were compared using analysis of covariance followed by a Tukey
test to determine significant differences between slopes ( Zar, 1984). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#51:1>
All statistical analysis was conducted using the computer program
SYSTAT for Macintosh computers ( Wilkinson, 1992). </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#66:1>
A highly significant variation was shown in the linear functional
response curves of the three mysid species preying upon <foreign> <it>
Artemia </it> sp. metanauplii </foreign> ( <it> F </it> = 6.26, <it> df </it>
= 50, p = 0.001).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#67:1>
The predation rate values in <it> <foreign> P. rufa </foreign> </it>
were lower than those in <it> <foreign> T. tasmaniae </foreign> </it> (
p&lt;0.0001), but comparable to <it> <foreign> A. mixta australis </foreign>
</it> ( p &gt; 0.05).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#68:1>
The predation rates on <foreign> <it> Artemia </it> sp. metanauplii
</foreign> by <it> <foreign> T. tasmaniae </foreign> </it> were double than
those by <it> <foreign> P. rufa </foreign> </it> and <it> <foreign> A. mixta
australis </foreign> </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#69:1>
All three species showed an increasing linear curve as against
increasing prey concentration ( Figure 1A). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#70:1>
The lowest average predation rate for <it> <foreign> A. mixta
australis </foreign> </it> was 0.36 + 0.08 SE ( standard error) metanauplii
mysid <sp> - 1 </sp> hour <sp> - 1 </sp> at the lowest prey density ( Figure
1A).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#71:1>
<it> <foreign> A. mixta australis </foreign> </it> predation rates
varied significantly over the increasing prey concentration ( <it> H </it> =
8.67, <it> df </it> =3, p &lt; 0. 05).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#72:1>
The maximum predation rate of 1.77 + 0.43 SE was recorded at the
second highest prey concentration of 30 litre <sp> - 1 </sp> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#73:1>
The mean predation rate at this prey concentration was only
significantly different from those at the two lowest prey concentrations ( Q
&lt; 0.05), while for the rest of the treatments, means were not
significantly different ( Q &gt; 0.05 for all). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#74:1>
The average predation rates by <it> <foreign> T. tasmaniae
</foreign> </it> also increased with increasing <foreign> <it> Artemia </it>
sp. metanauplii </foreign> concentration with a minimum of 0.7 + 0.08 SE and
reaching a maximum of 3.5 + 0.33 SE at 45 litre <sp> - 1 </sp> ( <it> H </it>
= 16.65, <it> df </it> = 3, p &lt; 0.01) ( Figure 1A).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#75:1>
The predation rate in the highest prey concentration differed
significantly from that in the lowest prey concentration ( Q &lt; 0.005), but
was similar to the second highest prey concentration ( Q &gt; 0.05).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#76:1>
The latter was also significantly different from the predation rate
at the lowest prey concentration ( Q &lt; 0.05), but not with that at the
second lowest prey concentration ( Q &gt; 0.05). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#77:1>
The average predation rates by <it> <foreign> P. rufa </foreign>
</it> on <it> <foreign> Artemia </foreign> </it> sp. metanauplii followed a
linear relationship with increasing prey concentration, and these values
varied significantly ( <it> H </it> = 14.25, <it> df </it> = 3, p &lt;0.05) (
Fig. 1A).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#78:1>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#79:1>
The predation rate at the highest prey concentration differed

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#86:1>
At the lowest prey density, average <it> <foreign> P. rufa
</foreign> </it> ingestion rate was 4 + 0.29 prey mysid <sp> - 1 </sp> hour
<sp> - 1 </sp> , and it continued to increase with increasing prey density to
a maximum ingestion rate of 11.75 + 0.48 prey mysid <sp> - 1 </sp> hour <sp>
- 1 </sp> at 20 litre <sp> - 1 </sp> density ( Figure 1B).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#87:1>
Dissected mysid foreguts revealed 100% fullness while those with very
low ingestion rates showed 30% to 50% fullness.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#88:1>
<it> P. rufa </it> ingestion rates varied significantly with
increasing prey density ( <it> H </it> = 14. 25, <it> df </it> = 3, p &lt; 0.
01), although those at 5 and 10 litre <sp> - 1 </sp> were the same ( Q &gt;
0.05).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#89:1>
This is because two out of the four mysids fed at 10 litre <sp> - 1
</sp> treatment density and 1 out of the four mysids at 15 litre <sp> - 1
</sp> gave relatively very low ( 0.5 and 3 prey mysid <sp> - 1 </sp> hour
<sp> - 1 </sp> , and 2.5 prey mysid <sp> - 1 </sp> hour <sp> - 1 </sp> ,
respectively) ingestion rates.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#90:1>
These mysids were mature females without young in their brood
pouches, and perhaps were about to moult.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#91:1>
Mysid ingestion rates at the two higher densities differed
significantly ( Q &lt; 0.05) from the two lower prey densities, but ingestion
rates between the two higher prey densities were similar ( Q &gt; 0.05).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#92:1>
The functional response curve of <it> P. rufa </it> to increasing
density of juvenile <it> <foreign> D. australis </foreign> </it> is linear (
Figure 1B). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#93:1>
Increasing density of <it> <foreign> D. australis </foreign>
</it> did not increase predation rates in <it> <foreign> T. tasmaniae
</foreign> </it> ( Figure 1B) ( <it> H </it> = 16.66, <it> df </it> =3, p
&gt; 0.24).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#94:1>
Very few individuals captured the prey.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#95:1>
The lowest successful predation rate was 1 prey mysid <sp> - 1 </sp>
hour <sp> - 1 </sp> , and the highest was 3.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#96:1>
Averages from the four prey density treatments ranged from 0.75-3.25
prey mysid <sp> - 1 </sp> hour <sp> - 1 </sp> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#97:1>
As in <it> <foreign> T. tasmaniae </foreign> </it> , very few
<it> <foreign> A. mixta australis </foreign> </it> captured the prey.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#98:1>
A predation rate of 0.5 prey mysid <sp> - 1 </sp> hour <sp> - 1 </sp>
was the lowest, and the highest was 2.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#99:1>
Increasing prey density did not increase predation rates ( <it> H
</it> = 4.13, <it> df </it> = 3, p &gt; 0.24), and the average ranged from
1.25-2.75 prey mysid <sp> - 1 </sp> hour <sp> - 1 </sp> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#100:1>
The functional response curves to the different <it> <foreign>
D. australis </foreign> </it> concentrations by the three mysid species
differed significantly ( <it> F </it> = 49.86, <it> df </it> = 45, p &lt;
0.001).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#101:1>
The variability was attributed to the significantly higher predation
rates by <it> P. rufa </it> compared to those in the other two species ( p
&lt; 0.001).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#102:1>
The predation rates of <it> <foreign> A. mixta australis </foreign>
</it> and <it> <foreign> T. tasmaniae </foreign> </it> showed no significant
difference ( p &gt; 0.05). </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#103:1>
<h> <bold> Discussion </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#104:1>
The functional response of predators may be classified into
types I, II, and III ( Holling, 1959a,b).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#105:1>
The type I or rectilinear response is characterized by a linear
increase in consumption rate up to a certain prey concentration where the
rate suddenly reaches a plateau and stays at zero with further increases in
prey concentration.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#106:1>
This is exemplified by filtration rate of filter feeders such as
daphniids ( Rigler, 1961), and calanoid copepods ( Frost, 1972).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#107:1>
The type II or exponential response is an initial proportional
increase with increasing prey concentration which gradually decreases as
saturation level of prey concentration is approached; beyond this predation
rates remain stationary with further increase in prey concentration as in the
type I functional response.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#108:1>
These two types of responses have been considered destabilizing to
predator-prey interactions because of the capacity of the prey to damp
predation rates by simply increasing its density.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#109:1>
In addition, at low prey density, predators could drive prey
populations to extinction.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#110:1>
This contrasts with the type III functional response in which
predation rate remains low at low prey concentration and starts to increase
at a certain higher prey density.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#111:1>
The type III functional response is stabilising to the predator-prey
interaction and is characterized by a sigmoid type of curve. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#112:1>
A Type 2 functional response curve is commonly observed among
invertebrate predators ( Holling, 1965).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#113:1>
A Holling type II has been reported in <it> <foreign> M. relicta
</foreign> </it> preying upon the copepod <it> <foreign> Epischura </foreign>
</it> , but a Holling type III functional response was shown for another
copepod prey <it> <foreign> Diaptomus </foreign> </it> ( Folt <it> <foreign>

Fulton ( 1982) reported a type II curve from laboratory experiments
on <it> <foreign> Mysidopsis bigelowi </foreign> </it> preying upon <it>
<foreign> Acartia tonsa </foreign> </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#115:1>
In contrast, a similar laboratory predation experiment involving
<it> <foreign> M. relicta </foreign> </it> and <it> <foreign> Epischura
</foreign> </it> collected from a different location showed a linear
functional response ( Cooper & Goldman, 1980).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#116:1>
Estimation of <it> <foreign> M. relicta </foreign> </it> predation
rates from field samples showed a similar linear type of curve which was
attributed to food limitation ( Bowers & Vanderploeg, 1982).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-025#117:1>
These differences in mysid functional response have been attributed
to prey vulnerability which varies according to prey types and their escape
abilities ( Folt <it> <foreign> et al. </foreign> </it> , 1982; Fulton, 1982;
Ohman, 1988; Yen, 1983; McClatchie, 1988), predator hunger and feeding
physiology ( Yen, 1983), aggregative behaviour of both prey and predator (
Folt, 1985), and temperature ( Fulton, 1983). </p> </I>
