<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#1:1>
Maria Beatriz Isabel Acosta <X> 1. Cite at least three events in the
Cold War that showed the weakness of Structural Realism as a Theory of
International Relations. </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#2:1>
Structural Realism was explained by Kenneth Waltz.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#3:1>
He states that wars are natural occurrences whose control or
elimination is beyond the wit of man: in other words, war is inevitable.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#4:1>
In the third image, International Conflict and International Anarchy,
there are several assumptions that were made.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#5:1>
Anarchy is said to be present in states that there is no automatic
harmony.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#6:1>
This means that conflict is inevitable and that in wars, there are no
victories but only varying degrees of defeat.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#7:1>
Each state also pursues its own interests in ways it judges best.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#8:1>
This also defines the states as the central actors in International
Relations ( they are unitary actors).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#9:1>
The State, according to Structural Realism, will use force to attain
its goals if it values these goals more than it values the pleasures of
peace.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#10:1>
And because any State may at anytime use force, all states must
constantly be ready either to counter force with force ( " fight") or to pay
the cost of weakness ( " surrender").

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#11:1>
Force is a means of achieving the external ends of States because, as
the third image explains, there exists no coexistent, reliable process of
reconciling the conflicts of interests that inevitably rise among similar
units in a condition of anarchy.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#12:1>
The power capabilities of the state come into play as a leverage in
bargaining among states over the outcomes of conflicts.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#13:1>
Leverage can be positive ( in forms of rewards), or negative ( in
forms of punishments), but in both cases the purpose is to influence the
decisions and actions of another state so as to bring about a more favorable
outcome for the actor using the leverage.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#14:1>
In other words, military force is an important form of leverage
because of security dilemma.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#15:1>
Another concept tackled was about rationality-that states are
rational actors, being able to decide on policies objectively. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#16:1>
Structural Realism has been criticized and scrutinized by other
theorists and people, and they have concluded with four major lines of
criticism. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#17:1>
The first point to consider is the assumption of International
Anarchy ( or the state of conflict).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#18:1>
If conflict is said to be inevitable, then how come there are
instances that States can cooperate?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#19:1>
Order also evolves through norms and institutions based on
reciprocity ( give-and-take) and cooperation ( agreement), even on law.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#20:1>
In other words, convergence of interests is possible, that there can
be agreements and mutual decisions that will benefit both ( or all) states.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#21:1>
In the Cold War, there were instances where cooperation - not
conflict - - existed.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#22:1>
During <foreign> d&eacute;tente </foreign> ( or relaxation of
tensions), there was mutual agreements and decisions made by the two
superpowers - US and USSR.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#23:1>
They both collaborated in bringing about agreements on a ceasefire
and disengagement of forces.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#24:1>
The following events or situations contradict the first assumption:

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#25:1>
<h> 1. Summits: &ldquo; Spirit of Geneva &rdquo; and &ldquo; Spirit
of Camp David &rdquo; </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#26:1>
In the Geneva Summit, US and USSR had their first talk on
disarmament, German reunification, and wider contacts of east and west.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#27:1>
This is to assure both sides of less conflict and more harmony.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#28:1>
In the Spirit of Camp David, they had negotiated on Israel ( US
assistance). </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#29:1>
<h> 2. Trade between east and west </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#30:1>
<foreign> &ldquo; Ospolitik &rdquo; </foreign> or eastern
<unclear> one word </unclear> is contributed by West Germany Chancellor Willy
Brandt.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#31:1>
This explains about the trade and economic relations of US/USSR.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#32:1>
In trade, one is to cooperate with the other so as to exchange goods.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#33:1>
The &ldquo; Great Grain Robbery &rdquo; is a concrete example of
such.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#34:1>
US gave or sold grain at lowest prices to USSR to keep good relations
with them, even lower prices than that of their own country 's. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#35:1>
The second point to consider is the assumption that states are
unitary actors: In contrary to this, State behavior is shaped by internal
bargaining among and within bureaucracies, interest groups and other actors
with divergent goals and interest.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#36:1>
In short, non-state actors play important roles and that their
influences should be considered in order to better understand the action of
states themselves. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#37:1>
Structural Realism has some weaknesses, and can be proven from
the following events in the Cold War.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#38:1>
<h> 1. Non-state actors were pressure groups. </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#39:1>
During the duration of the Arms Race, the decision of armament
was influenced by many groups: the military, the weapons industry, laborers,
technological development, and inventors ( scientists).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#40:1>
Each of the groups had different and distinct reasons for wanting to
develop and produce weaponry, and those pressures from them greatly affected
the decisions of the state. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#41:1>
<h> 2. Individuals influenced how state systems were run. </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#42:1>
When Joseph Stalin died, there was an observable shift in the
USSR policies.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#43:1>
This gives proof that individuals were important in shaping the state
policies.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#44:1>
The reason to this is because individuals, being unique and different
from each other, have different perspectives and beliefs as to how a state
must be handled or governed.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#45:1>
When Stalin died, he was replaced by Nikita Krushchev, who vetoed the
ways of Stalin - in fact, he ordered the &ldquo; de-Stalinization &rdquo; of
the Soviet Union.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#46:1>
When Mikhail Gorbachev came into power, he also caused drastic
changes in Russia 's political system. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#47:1>
<h> 3. There can be other forms of leverage or ways to influence
actors than using Military force. </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#48:1>
Using military force can be costly compared with diplomacy,
conflict resolution, peacekeeping and other nonmilitary means.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#49:1>
In the Cuban Missile Crisis during the Cold War, President Kennedy
imposed or ordered naval blockade, instead of force or attacking USSR in
Cuba.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#50:1>
Another proposal which contradicts the assumption that one must use
military force as a leverage is the Moscow Treaty, signed by the 2
superpowers in agreeing not to attack, ( use force) using military means, to
resolve conflict. </p> <X> 2. DISCUSS THE MAIN ASSUMPTIONS OF THE FEMINIST
APPROACH TO INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#51:1>
Feminism has two insights - gender is socially constructed, and
the world is pervasively shaped by gendered meanings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#52:1>
The first insight explains that gender produces subjective
identities which we see and know the world.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#53:1>
Disregarding gender would mean denying more than half of the
population. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#54:1>
The second insight explains that we do not experience or &ldquo;
know &rdquo; the world as abstract &ldquo; humans &rdquo; but as embodied,
gendered beings.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#55:1>
If gender is socially constructed, then IR <&> =International
Relations </&> is socially constructed as well. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#56:1>
There are several areas taken up by Feminism, such as the concept
of actor and structure.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#57:1>
In Realism, it is said that the relationship of states are anarchic (
conflicting).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#58:1>
Feminism stresses that the States correspond to the male person or
masculinity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#59:1>
Feminism explains also the transportization of values of the
state, that male values ( such as objectivity, rationality, courage,
independence) dominate the state since states are dominated by males.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#60:1>
Feminism tells us that states need not be independent and sovereign.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#61:1>
The three strands/kinds of feminist approach has different
assumptions as well.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#62:1>
The Essentialists point out the role or condition of &ldquo; women as
women", and accept women 's place in society.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#63:1>
The liberalists state that women should and are equal to men, that
they must have equality in responsibility and roles, such as in the
government and in the military.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#64:1>
The postmodernists on the other hand differ a lot from the other two.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#65:1>
They challenge a total rethinking of the structure, challenging
society.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#66:1>
This is the most difficult approach to achieve, because this means
you have to change the entire structure. </p> <X> 3. COMPARE & CONTRAST TWO
US ARMS RACE DOCTRINES. </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#67:1>
The arms race policies were agreed upon according to the increase
and/or decrease of defense budget, and according to the emphasis on the
kind/type of weapons. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#68:1>
Two out of several arms race policies of the US are the <mention>
Flexible Response </mention> and the <mention> StarWars Project </mention> (
Strategic Defense Initiative).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#69:1>
These two doctrines favored nuclear weapons rather than conventional
ones.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#70:1>
In <mention> Flexible Response </mention> , there is the theory of
<mention> MAD </mention> that was developed.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#71:1>
<mention> Mutually Assured Destruction </mention> meant that if
Russia attacked the west, the west would make sure that they would suitably
retaliate ( there would be no winners).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#72:1>
There are two conditions: there must be no first strike capability (
or the ability to wipe out in one strike), and having second strike
capability ( ability to survive the first strike).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#73:1>
It is also a policy to use the same weapons which the other party is
using against the US. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#74:1>
The <mention> Starwars </mention> or SDI system was originally
planned to provide a layered defense employing advanced weapons technologies,
some of which were only in the preliminary stage.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#75:1>
The goal of SDI was to intercept incoming missiles in midcourse (
high above the earth).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#76:1>
Some of the weapons were in development, but others were not certain
to be attainable.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#77:1>
This policy was controversial because of the cost - it was estimated
to total more than &dollar;100 billion.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#78:1>
Other nations also feared that the SDI system could have been used
offensively. </p> <X> 4. COMPARE AND CONTRAST THE NATURE AND WAYS OF
ADDRESSING STATE-CENTERED AND HUMAN-SECURITY ISSUES. </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#79:1>
After the Cold War, there was a noticeable shift in security
issues from State to Human Security.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#80:1>
State Security stresses the military defense of the state and
exertion of influence over other states, whereas human security is the
security of the individual as a minimum security against gross human rights
violations.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#81:1>
Both have core values ( for humans, it is their rights, basic needs,
freedom, <foreign> etc. </foreign> , and for the state, their territory,
sovereignty and population), and when these values are threatened ( by other
states and intra-state groups for states, and other people and government,
poverty for individuals) this poses as a threat to the referent object ( the
state and the individual).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#82:1>
In both issues, other factors threaten the referent object, most
commonly through ( physical) violence such as war, revolts, ethnic violence
and government abuse.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#83:1>
And in addition, when either one of the referent objects is
threatened, this also leads for the other one to be threatened as well, for
the state composes of individuals too.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#84:1>
In solving these issues, one common denominator is acquiring the
proper knowledge as to why these issues occur in the first place.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#85:1>
As the role of Global Society plays, it must intervene in a
humanitarian way.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#86:1>
With multilateral intervention, there must be a cooperative effort in
the part of many states to address these problems.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#87:1>
Education will also lead to a better understanding and will avoid
prejudice.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#88:1>
In contrast, threats to the state can be resolved through military
means, such as going to war. </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#89:2>
By: Irene Marie R. Ignacio

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#90:2>
<h> Midterm Exam: Major Essay </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#91:2>
The Cold War truly brought out new major changes and effects in
each and everyone 's life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#92:2>
The Cold War, which occurred from 1950 to 1990, was the conflict
between the two great superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, in
ideological, political, economical and social terms.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#93:2>
This Cold War is very inevitable to mention when talking about
international security, for in this event, the use and real production of
nuclear weapons and it has the highest effect on the national budgets of
nations.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#94:2>
Even if there really were no big and controversial confrontations
between the US and USSR, it was still called a <mention> &ldquo; war &rdquo;
</mention> , because it still affected different countries and actually used
other countries to war.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#95:2>
It also increased the supply of arms, therefore leading to an
increase in arms race.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#96:2>
This essay aims to give three events in this Cold War that showed the
weakness of Realism as an International Relations Theory. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#97:2>
The International Relations Theory functions to describe what is
going on, to explain the current situation and to predict what may happen
next.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#98:2>
It concentrates on the relationship of states regarding war and
peace.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#99:2>
Realism, using this theory, has three main assumptions.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#100:2>
First, states are the most influential and main actors.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#101:2>
Second, states ' actions are motivated by their own interests.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#102:2>
Lastly, conflict is inevitable.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#103:2>
In relation to the Cold War, these assumptions are truly falsified
and not completely true.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#104:2>
They have been proven not totally applicable using certain events in
the Cold War. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#105:2>
First, the realist thought that States are the most influential
and main actors during the Cold War is challenged and weakened by the
existence of the United Nations.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#106:2>
The United Nations did so many important actions during that time.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#107:2>
But one specific event is <del> ( the) </del> having the Baruch
Plan.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#108:2>
This plan may also be used to represent the Arms Race.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#109:2>
However, since this plan was still included and important in the
Cold War, this paper wishes to use the Baruch Plan to show how existence and
participation of the UN weakened the first mentioned realist assumption.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#110:2>
The Baruch Plan <del> ( in) ( 19) </del> ensured that the new source
of energy was controlled by the UN and used for peaceful means.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#111:2>
In addition, not only was the UN formed alone, there was also the
existence and participation of other non-state actors.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#112:2>
These global organizations were motivated to move by inner factors.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#113:2>
With all these, we cannot conclude that states were indeed the most
influential and main actors during the war.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#114:2>
These non-state actors, such as the UN, served big significant roles
during the Cold War.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#115:2>
Their influences were really great and needed to understand the
actions of the states themselves.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#116:2>
Therefore, leaving out <del> ( other) </del> non-state actors is one
main weakness of Realism as an IR Theory. <&> text beyond the 2000 words </&>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#117:2>
Second, the realist thought that states ' actions are motivated
by their own interests was disproven by the signing of the different treaties
by different countries during the Cold War.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#118:2>
An example of this event is the Test Ban Treaty in 1963, where it
states that nuclear testing is prohibited in the atmosphere, outer space and
underwater.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#119:2>
Then, there was the Moscow Treaty wherein Germany and USSR agreed
that they will not use violence on each other 's territories.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#120:2>
In addition, there was the Strategic Arms Limitation Theory I and II
which limited the deployments of US and USSR.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#121:2>
These are just some of the events in the Cold War that can prove
that it is not totally true that states act according to their own interests.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#122:2>
When we say <mention> treaty </mention> , it is an agreement of at
least two parties.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#123:2>
By signing it, you are agreeing on the benefit of all and not just
your own interest.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#124:2>
Therefore, it is not necessarily true that states act according to
their own interest, because they also act for the benefit of everyone
involved. </p> Lastly, Realism also assumes and states that conflict is
inevitable.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#125:2>
Conflict is not inevitable, for they can be avoided and resolved.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#126:2>
The Détente of the 1950s and 1960s to 1980s show and prove this.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#127:2>
USSR joined the summer games in 1952 and winter games in 1956.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#128:2>
This clearly shows trust for the part of USSR.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#129:2>
Then, the Anti-Proliferation Treaty came about wherein it was
settled that weapons should not be supplied, produced and accepted.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#130:2>
In addition, there was the Four Power Agreement that stated that
questions causing conflicts were regulated.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#131:2>
In a way, we can sense that states made efforts to avoid conflict.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#132:2>
Trust was showed, like USSR 's joining the games.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#133:2>
These events can show the willingness and capability of states to
avoid war.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#134:2>
Indeed, conflict is evitable.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#135:2>
<del> ( Having) </del> Truly, Realism as an IR Theory has its own
weaknesses when we look at its assumptions.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#136:2>
States are not just the main actors, for there was the active
participation of non-state actors like the United Nations.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#137:2>
Next, states ' actions are not just motivated by their own
interests, for some events show that they act for the benefit of all.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#138:2>
Lastly, conflict is avoidable, for states can make efforts and
willingness to avoid conflict.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#139:2>
All in all, theories, like IR and Realism, have its own weaknesses
and flaws.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#140:2>
We just have to open our eyes and be open to these.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#141:2>
Short Answer Questions: 1. For years, women have tried to uplift
their roles as women. 2.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#142:2>
With this, an action, called Feminism came about. 3.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#143:2>
Feminism is the power struggle challenging patriarchy. 4.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#144:2>
It is an awareness that women are oppressed and exploited in
society. 5.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#145:2>
Feminists see the need for the uplifting roles of women. 6.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#146:2>
The feminist approach, as an International Relations view, assumes
that in a realist 's point of view, states are the main actors and explained
through laws. 7.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#147:2>
Feminists do not believe in the possibility of the state acting
against dominant male interests. 8.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#148:2>
They think that if the state penetrates to its foundation of gender
bias, it cannot act in a neutral, disinterested and &ldquo; self-maximizing
&rdquo; manner to provide security. 9.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#149:2>
In addition, feminists assume that the state projects to reclaim the
private. 10.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#150:2>
They say that the human rights are not examined well. 11.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#151:2>
Feminists reject classical paradigm of the concept of power. 12.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#152:2>
They challenge the socially constructed look on power and expose the
dichotomies, like public and private. 13.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#153:2>
14. During the Arms Race, there were two very distinct doctrines
that came about. 15.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#154:2>
These are the NSC 68 and the New look by the U. 16.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#155:2>
S. 17.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#156:2>
The NSC 68 was by Paul Nitze. 18.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#157:2>
In here, it assumed that U. 19.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#158:2>
S. 20.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#159:2>
S. 21.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#160:2>
R. 22.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#161:2>
would have 200 long-ranged atomic charges with its build up. 23.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#162:2>
The US was threatened, and therefore, had to rearm. 24.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#163:2>
The U. 25.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#164:2>
S. 26.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#165:2>
increased its national defense budget to

$40B. 27.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#166:2>
On the other hand, the other doctrine is the New Look. 28.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#167:2>
The New Look is a new defense policy stating that they would respond
to even small conventional attacks using nuclear weapons. 29.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#168:2>
They will attack in a different area, in a different way. 30.

These two doctrines were motivated by the Korean War in the 1950 's.

R. 35.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#174:2>
, while the New look is about the deployment of tactical weapons by
the U. 36.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#175:2>
S. 37.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#176:2>
Both, on the other hand, are related in the sense that they are both
about the increase in the national defense budget of the U. 38.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#177:2>
S. 39.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#178:2>
Moreover, they are both concerned with improving the weapons. 40.

41. After the Cold War, there was a radical change on the onlook of
security. 42.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#180:2>
The focus on state security was shifted to human security. 43.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#181:2>
When we say state-centered security, we are focusing n the situation
of the state as a whole. 44.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#182:2>
We look at it in political and economical terms. 45.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#183:2>
We try to see if the state, as a unit, is uplifting. 46.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#184:2>
On the other hand, when we say human security, we are concerned with
the individuals themselves within a state. 47.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#185:2>
When we talk about security, we are referring to a relative concept
based on a subject of referent. 48.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#186:2>
In state security, we look at the international states and global
societies as helping factors. 49.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#187:2>
However, in human security, we look at human rights as protecting
factors. 50.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#188:2>
In a state, the state itself is the object of referent. 51.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#189:2>
Its core values are its territories, government, population, etc.
52.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#190:2>
Then, its exogenous or threats are other states, intra-state war,
violence, etc. 53.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#191:2>
In contrast, for human security, we see the individuals as the
object of referent. 54.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#192:2>
Their core values are their rights, basic needs, like food, and
shelter, freedom and economic and social statuses. 55.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#193:2>
Their exogenous are other people, government, poverty, ethnic
violence and government abuse. 56.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-018#194:2>
If we are to compare them, they are the same in the sense that the
state and individuals seek for security. 57. </I>
