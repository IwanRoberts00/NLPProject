<&> The Presiding Officer calls on the speaker </&> 
Your Honor the Chief Justice of the Philippines Your Honor the Senate President of the Philippines Your Honors Members of the Senate esteemed colleagues of the defense friends ladies and gentlemen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#2:1:A>
Members of the Senate our team of prosecutors will show that during his brief incumbency of barely over two years Joseph Ejercito Estrada has violated the oath previously mentioned by Congressman Belmonte had violated the law not once not twice but regularly like clockwork
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#3:1:A>
The prosecutors will again expose the existence of a criminal syndicate directed from the highest office of the land
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#4:1:A>
This is the gangland mob that threatens to rule us
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#5:1:A>
This not the parliament of the street is the mob rule
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#6:1:A>
The mob rule that will savage our Constitution and the very fabric of our society unless we destroy it now before it destroys us
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#7:1:A>
I stated that we will expose the existence of the criminal syndicate again
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#8:1:A>
I use the word <mention> again </mention> because fortunately for our panel much of the shocking and sordid details of this story have been unfolded before this very chamber before Your Honors
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#9:1:A>
And our task will be to simply present in proper form the evidence and testimony which the Filipino people already know and have already evaluated for themselves and to link up some <unclear> word </unclear> sense
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#10:1:A>
In our presentation we will therefore focus only on the salient points
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#11:1:A>
Governor Chavit Singson will re-affirm before Your Honors the following facts and events
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#12:1:A>
Sometime in August nineteen ninety-eight the newly elected President Joseph Ejercito Estrada summoned Bong Pineda Charlie Atong Ang and Governor Chavit Singson to his Polk Street residence to discuss <indig> jueteng </indig> operations in the country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#13:1:A>
On that occasion President Estrada prohibited Pineda from continuing to deliver <indig> jueteng </indig> collections to him as the latter was already identified as <indig> jueteng </indig> lord
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#14:1:A>
Instead he appointed both Ang and Governor Singson as his national <indig> jueteng </indig> collectors and delivery men
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#15:1:A>
Of course we all remember who Atong Ang is and his association with Joseph Ejercito Estrada
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#16:1:A>
Barely two months later however after a heated disagreement over the President 's refusal to give in to Atong Ang 's demand for a share in certain sugar allocations Atong Ang was stripped by President Estrada of his <indig> jueteng </indig> collection authority
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#17:1:A>
This left Governor Singson as the presidential appointee in charge of these illegal collections
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#18:1:A>
The testimony of Governor Singson will re-affirm that from November nineteen ninety-eight to August two thousand an average of five million pesos usually in crisp one thousand peso bills was hand-delivered by him to President Estrada every fifteen days either in his residence at Polk Street Greenhills or in Malaca&ntilde;ang or in the house of one of his mistresses Guia Gomez
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#19:1:A>
And for accounting purposes President Estrada assigned an auditor in the person of Mrs Yolanda Ricaforte wife of Tourism Undersecretary Orestes Ricaforte to monitor and deliver the receipt of the <indig> tong </indig> collections as well as the <.> disburse </.> disbursement therefrom in a ledger
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#20:1:A>
For a period until June nineteen ninety-eight the excess of the <indig> jueteng </indig> collections after the five million peso for the President has been set aside every fifteen days would be earmarked by Governor Singson also on the orders of President Estrada for the <.> ton </.> construction of the Fontainebleau Casino in the former Clark Air Base
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#21:1:A>
Although the true owner of Fontainebleau was the President on his instruction the stock holdings was placed in the names of Jaime de Chavez one of his cronies Jesus Pineda a schoolmate of his and Edmundo Silverio a nominee of Butch Tenorio the President of PAGCOR <&> acronym for Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#22:1:A>
The President eventually opted to discontinue the Fontainebleau operation in favor of Fontana Casino where his stakes have been greater and financial rewards higher
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#23:1:A>
When it was decided to abort the Fontainebleau Casino operation Mrs Ricaforte also took over the duty of preparing the ledger and monitoring the collection and expenses of the <indig> jueteng </indig> operations including the sensitive task of depositing the presidential share in various accounts
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#24:1:A>
<unclear> 1 word </unclear> to Mrs Ricaforte all the accumulated collections from <indig> jueteng </indig> including future collections
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#25:1:A>
So Mrs Ricaforte opened several separate accounts in different branches of Equitable Bank where she deposited the collections
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#26:1:A>
Governor Singson will re-affirm that this year two hundred million was withdrawn by Mrs Ricaforte from the said deposits in Equitable Bank placed in various interim accounts to cleanse the dirty money before it was placed at the disposal of the lord of all gambling lords
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#27:1:A>
The withdrawal of the amount also coincided with the shift of illegal gambling operation from <indig> jueteng </indig> to a bigger form known as Bingo Two Ball where the stakes are much higher this time using PAGCOR as front of the grand design to further centralize the rewards of gambling operations 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#> Just like in the shift from Fontainebleau Casino to Fontana Casino the shift from <indig> jueteng </indig> to Bingo Two Balls was motivated by the desire of greed for greater greater financial reward
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#30:1:A>
The testimony of Governor Singson will be corroborated by several witnesses including the <indig> jueteng </indig> collection ledger which Mrs Ricaforte admits having maintained
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#31:1:A>
We will present the checks that Governor Singson surrendered to Mrs Ricaforte on instruction of President Estrada
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#32:1:A>
We will present the branch records of the separate bank accounts that Mrs Ricaforte opened on orders of President Estrada and where she deposited said checks on the succeeding <indig> jueteng </indig> collections
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#33:1:A>
We will present to Your Honors the checks totaling two hundred million pesos which Mrs Ricaforte handed over and turned to lawyer by the name of Atty Edward Serapio
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#34:1:A>
We will present the testimony of Atty Serapio at the hearing of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee where he admitted that he indeed was the <.> Predi </.> Presidential Assistant in Malaca&ntilde;ang at that time
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#35:1:A>
That he was the personal legal adviser of President Estrada and of his families
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#36:1:A>
That the two hundred million was transferred by him to the funds of the corporation that President Estrada ordered him to organize
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#37:1:A>
That the officers of this corporation aside from himself was Raul de Guzman the brother-in-law of the President Estrada George Go the majority stock holder of Equitable Bank and the President 's banker and two employees of Raul de Guzman in U P
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#38:1:A>
We will also show the open forum at the meeting of the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines or FOCAP where President Estrada made admissions corroborative of the accusations of Governor Chavit Chavit Singson against him
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#39:1:A>
It is certain that the lawyers of the President will tell you that Governor Singson should not be believed because he has admitted being a co-conspirator in the commission of the crime
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#40:1:A>
But in the statement <unclear> words </unclear> a co-conspirator should still be accepted even if uncorroborated when it is shown to be sincere in itself because given unhesitantly and in a straightforward manner and is full of details which by their nature could not have been the result of a deliberate afterthought
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#41:1:A>
Who is saying this
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#42:1:A>
This is the pronouncement of our Supreme Court in the decision where they handed down that decision only recently last August
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#43:1:A>
After you have heard him determine on the basis whether Governor Singson deserves to be believed especially after we shall have presented you the corroborating documentary evidences in support of his testimony
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#44:1:A>
Governor Singson will swear under oath that he personally handed five million pesos to the President every fifteen days commencing the year of nineteen ninety until the beginning of this year
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#45:1:A>
Once made this is an accusation that nobody except the President can deny it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#46:1:A>
It is a denial that nobody but nobody can make for him under oath
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#47:1:A>
For the past month President Estrada has gallantly promised time and again on television on radio in the newspaper that when the impeachment trial begins he will face the people and his accusers and answer all charges point by point
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#48:1:A>
Will the President still do so
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#49:1:A>
Your Honors as we have narrated our evidence will be the testimony of the very person who handed money to the President fifty million five million pesos every fifteen days like clockwork
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#50:1:A>
It is a firsthand testimony
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#51:1:A>
The rest of his story will be corroborated in other essentials not by other witnesses but by the very statement of the President himself
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#52:1:A>
And after we are through with our evidence we have no doubt that you Your Honors will render a judgment of conviction with a clear conscience
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#53:1:A>
Thank you very much

<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#54:2:A>
Mr Chief Justice Your Honors I am Feliciano Belmonte Jr of the fourth district of Quezon City
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#55:2:A>
This afternoon we the House prosecutors are tasked to fulfill a duty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#56:2:A>
It is a duty that none of us relish
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#57:2:A>
It is painful painful because we will prove to the judges in this procidy proceedings that the faith and trust that we have bestowed on our President had been abused
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#59:2:A>
It is a grave duty grave because we are asking the judges that Joseph Ejercito Estrada whom we elected as President be removed from the presidency at once for the sake of the country for the sake of the people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#61:2:A>
It is a burden that the Constitution has placed on the shoulders of the prosecutors and it is a duty that we will faithfully fulfill
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#62:2:A>
When I make reference to the judges in these impeachment proceedings Your Honors I am not addressing the Senators here assembled alone because it is not only Joseph Ejercito Estrada who has been put on trial here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#63:2:A>
We the prosecutors and the house of Congress that we represent this chamber sitting in judgment the judiciary here personified by the Chief Justice the moral values that we hold dear indeed the entire structure of government and our society all are as much on trial in these proceedings
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#65:2:A>
The judges are the people who even now watch our every move and listen intently to our every word
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#66:2:A>
It is they Your Honors whom we the prosecutors also address because it is to them <,> that we all are accountable for what we will do here <&> a forty second translation of previous sentences in Filipino </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#67:2:A>
They say that all trials have innocent beginnings <&> a forty-five second speech in Filipino </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#68:2:A>
Central to the oath taken by Joseph Ejercito Estrada before then Chief Justice Andres Narvasa who is now here with us are the phrases to quote to execute its laws and quote to consecrate myself to the service of the nation <&> a forty-five second speech in Filipino </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#69:2:A>
The prosecution will show that not only did Joseph Ejercito Estrada not execute the laws he was the first to violate them
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#71:2:A>
Prosecutors will show that during his brief incumbency of barely over two years Joseph Ejercito Estrada has violated his oath of office had violated the law not once not twice but regularly like clockwork <&> a one minute speech in Filipino </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#72:2:A>
Behind all this legalese what do these charges mean
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#73:2:A>
Simply that Joseph Ejercito Estrada has failed the Filipino people especially the poor betrayed their hopes and broke their dreams <&> a ten second speech in Filipino </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#74:2:A>
And there is nothing mysterious or arcane about this process
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#75:2:A>
It is not about lawyers it is not about technicalities
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#77:2:A>
Common sense in the light of a person 's common experience is enough to appreciate the evidence and to reach a knowledgeable fair and patriotic conclusion
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-022#78:2:A>
I thank you Your Honors 
 </I>
