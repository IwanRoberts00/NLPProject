<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#4:1>
THE past few months, three centers with new equipment for
correcting myopia or nearsightedness were launched in Metro Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#5:1>
The Excimer laser refractive surgery alters the cornea 's shape and
enables the patient to get rid of his corrective lenses forever. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#6:1>
Previously, patients with high refractions had the option to
undergo surgical radial keratotomy ( RK).

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#7:1>
The doctor slits the cornea with the knife - - at the risk of
perforating it and causing complications. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#8:1>
Now comes photorefractive keratectomy ( PRK) or corrective laser
surgery, which has been proven to be safer.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#9:1>
The Excimer Laser is a &ldquo; cold &rdquo; shortwave laser used to
reshape the curvature of the cornea in the procedure known as PRK, the
results are believed to be precise and uniform. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#10:1>
During exposure, the beam removes micron-thin layers of corneal
tissue which is less than half the thickness of the human hair.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#11:1>
Contact time is only a millionth of a second.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#12:1>
No heat is generated.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#13:1>
Calculation and execution are done with the aid of a computer.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#14:1>
Measurements are highly accurate and the results are predictable.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#15:1>
PRK is performed at the Institute of Refractive Laser Surgery in
Alegria Bldg., Pasong Tamo Ext., Makati City.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#16:1>
The institute was founded by a group of leading Filipino eye
surgeons, with the support of experts in medical laser technology. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#17:1>
The group includes Drs. Cosme N. Naval, Salvador R. Salceda, Ma.
Phoebe Lim-Catipon, Alexander Joseph L. Reyes, Edgardo T. Aguirre, Jimmy L.
Dinglasan, Sabino A. Santos Jr., Jose Gabriel A. Santos and Glenn P. Abundo.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#18:1>
The Summit Refractive Laser Center 's Eye Referral Center also
offers medical laser technology services. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#19:1>
<h> <bold> What is myopia </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#20:1>
According to Dr. Julian Pancho S. Garcia, <quote> &ldquo; The
error of refraction arises primarily from eyeball size.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#21:1>
For myopics, the eyeball is too large that the focus is only in
front.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#22:1>
It doesn't reach the retina.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#23:1>
To minimize the length, we remove portions of the coat of the cornea
so your focus will reach the maximum. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#24:1>
Who can undergo laser surgery?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#25:1>
The patient should be at least 20 years old, have a stable
refraction, and not have corneal disease or glaucoma. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#26:1>
Diabetics, hypertensives, contact-lens wearers who have developed
complications or can no longer tolerate lenses are also suitable for this
surgery. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#27:1>
Laser surgery is performed first on one eye.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#28:1>
The second operation is performed only after the first has healed.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#29:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The public should know that this is not an
instant thing, &rdquo; </quote> says Dr. Garcia Jr.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#30:1>
Although healing takes up to six months, the patient must have
regular follow-up examinations up to the second year after the operation.
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#31:1>
<h> <bold> 20 minutes </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#32:1>
Before surgery, contact lens wearers should remove their lens,
two days for soft lens, a week for hard lens.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#33:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The important thing is to get an accurate refraction
because the results would hinge on it.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#34:1>
That 's what you feed on the computer which calculates the number of
shots it 's going to fire," </quote> says Dr. Garcia. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#35:1>
He explained the procedure at Eye Referral Center.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#36:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Step 1, take a good refraction; Step 2, do specula
microscopy ( have the state of the cornea photographed by a machine); and
Step 3, the procedure. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#37:1>
It takes 15 to 20 minutes to prepare the patient for the
operation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#38:1>
The doctor applies gel on top of the patient 's cornea and fires the
laser to make him feel what will happen.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#39:1>
The gel is then removed and laser is fired on the cornea. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#40:1>
In the second stage of the familiarization, the patient
experiences the smell and sound of the actual operation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#41:1>
The computer calculates how many shots the patient needs for the
cornea. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#42:1>
The laser sounds like a clackety typewriter that <foreign>
crescendoes </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#43:1>
The smell is similar to when one is having a dental cleaning.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#44:1>
Once the doctor determines that the patient can fixate his cornea, he
activates the laser. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#45:1>
It takes only 30 to 45 seconds to remove the epithelium - - the
thin, outer layer of the cornea. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#46:1>
After the procedure, the patient wears an eye patch and rests for
24 hours to ease tearing.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#47:1>
The patient will experience either discomfort or tearing for three
days.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#48:1>
Then, he or she can resume normal activities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#49:1>
Contact lens is usually worn on the other eye if one has a high
refraction. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#50:1>
While healing, the patient must religiously apply eye medications
and see the doctor to determine how he reacts to the surgery. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#51:1>
<h> <bold> Possible complications </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#52:1>
Although the doctor will aim for zero or normal vision in
correcting the refraction, patients will react differently to the surgery.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#53:1>
According to a study of the patients with refraction of 200 to -
600, half were able to have 20/20 or normal vision.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#54:1>
Twenty-five percent either had a grade of + or - 50, ( far or
near-sighted).

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#55:1>
About 20 percent reported + or - 100.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#56:1>
It is more difficult to predict the results of people with higher
refraction. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#57:1>
There is also the risk of overcorrecting.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#58:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Let 's say you 're a minus - 8, and we correct that.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#59:1>
Ideally we should get +75 or +1 after the procedure.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#60:1>
Why the plus?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#61:1>
Because if you 're down to no grade, once you heal, the cells will
regenerate.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#62:1>
Because you removed the superficial layer, the cornea thickens again.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#63:1>
The hyperoptic sheet is thinner than the expected result.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#64:1>
As it heals, it goes back to the ideal thickness, &rdquo; </quote>
says Dr. Garcia. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#65:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The other complication is possible corneal haze,
cloudiness.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#66:1>
But it is more a problem for the doctor, unless the patient can feel
it. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#67:1>
Blindness is a question that pops up immediately.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#68:1>
But only one case had been reported.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#69:1>
A drug addict underwent the procedure but did not put the
antibiotics.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#70:1>
He developed secondary infection and underwent corneal transplant.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#71:1>
Other complaints would include discomfort or feeling of a foreign
body in the eye and two or three days of tearing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#72:1>
Patients with astigmatic correction aside from myopia might need
additional surgery.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#73:1>
And those over 40 years old will still need reading glasses. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#74:1>
Eye Referral Center offers laser surgery at the introductory
price of &peso;12,000 to &peso;15,000 per eye, depending on the refraction,
until October.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#75:1>
If the patient went through the normal healing process and ended with
a grade of - 200, the repeat procedure becomes part of the package.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#76:1>
In Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia, it 's offered for
US&dollar;1,200.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#77:1>
In the States, it ranges from &dollar;1,500 to &dollar;2,500 per eye.
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#78:1>
<h> <bold> Three centers </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#79:1>
Before undergoing surgery, prospective patients should be
familiar with the different brands of refractive laser surgery. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#80:1>
Ophthalmologist Timothy Elbert Tan explained that the Excimer
Laser uses two inert substances that don't normally synthesize: argon and
fluorine.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#81:1>
<quote> &ldquo; If you put them in a closed container and apply
energy, they come together and get excited dimers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#82:1>
When you release energy, they release the photon which is used in
surgery. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#83:1>
Thus the name, Excimer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#84:1>
Eye Referral Center was the first to introduce the pioneer brand,
Summit.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#85:1>
Thirteen patients have tried the surgery at Eye Referral Center and
are said to be happy about the results. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#86:1>
The Institute of Refractive Laser Surgery followed with the
<foreign> Technolas Keracor </foreign> 116 by the German group Chiron
Technolas.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#87:1>
The American Eye Correction Center will soon introduce the VisX
20/20. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#88:1>
Of the 800,000 refractive laser surgeries done worldwide, 500,000
were done using the Summit brand.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#89:1>
The laser works from the middle to the cornea and reaches outward.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#90:1>
The American VisX 20/20 was originally an industrial laser used
to etch silicon chips.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#91:1>
It was later modified for the delicate medical surgery.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#92:1>
When fired, the laser moves in a concentric circle, from the larger
area of the cornea to the inner. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#93:1>
The <foreign> Technolas Keracor </foreign> 116 slits laser beams
around the cornea, which takes a longer time and may cause inflammation,
depending on the patient 's condition. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#94:1>
<h> <bold> Don't be misled </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#95:1>
Dr. Tan warned that prospective patients should not be misled by
claims that the surgery is painless, fully guaranteed and that the laser
brand has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#96:1>
The procedure itself may be painless, but not after it.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#97:1>
<quote> &ldquo; All procedures cause inflammation because healing
requires it, &rdquo; </quote> said Dr. Tan.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#98:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Anything medical can't give a 100-percent guarantee.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#99:1>
What guarantee?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#100:1>
That you won't go blind or that your grade will be zero or much
lower? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#101:1>
<foreign> Technolas Keracor </foreign> and VisX 20/20 are still
pending approval from the USFDA.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#102:1>
Summit 's photo therapeutic keratectomy laser for corneal diseases
has been approved by the USFDA, while its photo refractive keratectomy laser
will get the nod in October.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#103:1>
Summit is used for clinical trial in France, Canada, Japan and the
US.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#104:1>
It has been quite successful in Britain, Germany, Spain, Korea,
Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Middle East, Greece and Italy. </p>

<quote> &ldquo; I 've been following this technology since 1991.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#106:1>
The procedure has been polished and the results better over the
years, &rdquo; </quote> said Dr. Tan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#107:1>
Another common query is how many surgeries the ophthalmologist
has performed.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#108:1>
<quote> &ldquo; It 's like the usual question for any other manual
surgery.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#109:1>
They 'll want to know how many the doctor has done.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#110:1>
That 's their gauge of how good the doctor is.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#111:1>
In this procedure it 's different.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#112:1>
The experience relevant here is refraction and minor surgery,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#113:1>
<quote> &ldquo; In the surgery itself, the important thing is
the doctor is there to assist and make sure the patient fixates on the light.

Once the patient starts moving we take our foot off the pedal.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#115:1>
It 's really a treatment modality that requires minimum physician
training. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#120:2>
Waste-to-energy ( WTE) technology, as the term implies, is a
mass-burn process that transforms garbage or municipal solid waste into steam
or electricity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#121:2>
Waste-to-energy facilities effectively complement the
traditional waste management methods, particularly recycling.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#122:2>
In many industrialized countries, recycling has been a main feature
of waste management efforts, but they depend on waste-to-energy technology
for disposing the greater bulk of their refuse.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#123:2>
Japan is a very ardent proponent of recycling yet it still combusts
70 percent of the waste that remains after recycling.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#124:2>
The Netherlands and Denmark are similarly noted for the high success
rate of recycling but each combusts 40 percent to 60 percent respectively, of
what remains.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#125:2>
These facts reveal that a sizeable amount of combustible materials
are left behind even after the most dynamic execution of recycling. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#126:2>
WTE is not a new technology, having its predecessor in the old
garbage incinerators that environmentalists had frowned upon, due to the
toxic gases these incinerators released into the atmosphere. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#127:2>
Time, talent, research and development, however, have made it
possible for a highly upgraded, efficient, safe, and affordable WTE that has
been successfully adopted in several countries.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#128:2>
Thus, environmental safety is ensured using state-of-the-art
emission control technology that cleanses combustion gases before they are
released into the atmosphere. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#129:2>
How does the facility work?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#130:2>
Essentially, recyclables are first sorted out and what remains are
brought by collection trucks to the facility site.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#131:2>
A typical operation is described as follows: <X> <quote> &ldquo;
Refuse collection trucks are weighed at the scalehouse and inspected for
safety.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#X132:2>
Once cleared, they enter the tipping building and dump their waste
into the storage pit.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#X133:2>
An overhead crane mixes the waste in the pit and lifts the waste up
into a feed chute leading to the furnace.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#X134:2>
From the feed chute, waste is pushed by hydraulic ram feeders onto
a stoker grate.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#X135:2>
The grate bars push upward against the natural downward movement of
the waste bed.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#X136:2>
This constant movement ensures that the burning waste is
continually agitated and pushed back, thus serving as underfire for
freshly-fed waste.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#X137:2>
A forced draft fan supplies the primary combustion air underneath
the grate.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#X138:2>
In addition, overfire is injected through the front and rear walls
of the furnace. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#X139:2>
Inside the steel tubes that form the furnace walls and the
boiler, heat from the combustion process converts water to steam.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#X140:2>
The superheater further heats the steam before it is sent to a
turbine generator to produce electricity.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#X141:2>
After passing through the boiler sections, the hot combustion gases
are used to preheat boiler feed water in the economizer.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#X142:2>
While the combustion gases move through the boiler, the bottom ash
slowly makes its way to the end of the grate where it falls into the water
quench through.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#X143:2>
From the boiler, the cooled gases enter the advance air pollution
control system.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#X144:2>
Using lime slurry, the dry scrubber neutralizes any acid-forming
gases, such as sulphur oxides and hydrogen chloride.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#X145:2>
Next, particulates are captured by a high-efficiency electrostatic
precipitator or a baghouse.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#X146:2>
As the gas stream travels through the filter devices more than 60
percent of particulate matter is removed.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#X147:2>
Captured fuel ash particles fall into hoppers and are transported
by an enclosed conveyor system to a discharge where they are wet to prevent
dust and mixed with the bottom ash from the grate.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#X148:2>
The ash residue is then conveyed to an enclosed building where it
is loaded into covered leak-proof trucks and taken to a landfill designed to
protect against groundwater contamination.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#X149:2>
Ash residues from the furnace can be processed for removal or
recyclable scrap iron.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-036#X150:2>
All aspects of the plant 's operation are monitored from a central
control room 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. &rdquo;
