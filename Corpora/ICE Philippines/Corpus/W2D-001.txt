<h> <bold> About PAEF </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-001#2:1>
The Philippine-American Educational Foundation ( PAEF) is a
binational organization responsible for the administration of the Fulbright
exchanges between the Philippines and the United States, the Hubert H.
Humphrey fellowships, and the East-West Center scholarships.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-001#3:1>
It also serves as a clearinghouse for information on educational
institutions and programs in the Philippines and the United States. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-001#4:1>
PAEF was established through an executive agreement signed by the
governments of the United States and the Philippines on March 23, 1948 to
carry out educational exchanges involving students, academics and
professionals from both countries.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-001#5:1>
Since 1948, Fulbright grants have been awarded to 1,700 Filipinos and
700 Americans for graduate degree study, teaching and research in the
Philippines and the United States.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-001#6:1>
Close to 400 graduate degree awards and 2,000 non-degree grants have
been given to Filipinos through the East-West Center program.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-001#7:1>
Another 70 Filipino professionals have gone to the United States on
Humphrey fellowships.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-001#8:1>
The Philippine program is the world 's longest continuing Fulbright
program.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-001#9:1>
It has enriched several generations of Filipinos and Americans.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-001#10:1>
Living in a different culture, forming lasting friendships with
colleagues in foreign countries and sharing new horizons are all part of what
has come to be known as the <quote> &ldquo; Fulbright experience." </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-001#11:1>
Principal funding support for the exchange programs administered
by PAEF comes from the United States and the Philippine governments.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-001#12:1>
In addition, the Philippine Department of Agriculture, the Philippine
Commission on Higher Education, the Washington SyCip Family Foundation,
Northwest Airlines, the Freeman Foundation and the Fund for Assistance to
Private Education have generously supported the Fulbright Program in the
Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-001#13:1>
Other organizations and institutions, including US and Philippine
universities, contribute through direct and indirect cost-sharing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-001#14:1>
While continuing to strengthen links with the academic and policy
community, PAEF will broaden partnerships with the private sector and build
new connections with business and philanthropic organizations in order to
carry on its mission of recruiting the best and the brightest young leaders
and professionals for the service of Philippine and American societies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-001#15:1>
Organizations and corporations can be part of the best known and
most prestigious scholarship program in the world by being a sponsor of
