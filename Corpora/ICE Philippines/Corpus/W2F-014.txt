<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#3:1>
It always seemed so hilarious when her mother would tell of it.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#4:1>
Every time her mother hung up her well-worn chartreuse apron with the
red apple print and they both sat at the kitchen table over a freshly-baked
mango cream pie, the story of Inez 's own birth always left her hiccupy with
laughter. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#5:1>
Inez 's mother, Marietta, would tell of eternal labor, dizzy
spells, controlled breathing, legs hung and spread in mid-air in all its
glory, shaved pubic hair, gadgets being poked into her, doctors peeking in
every now and then--the works.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#6:1>
There were no modern comforts in the nearest hospital that Marietta
had checked into early on that cold October morning and the labor room was
shared by around ten women, all writhing in pain, cross-eyed with discomfort
and sweating profusely like pigs in a stuffy old pen.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#7:1>
When any of the women managed to sit up with a raised fist, cursing
the man who had caused her all this hell, nurses hurriedly brought her to the
delivery room.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#8:1>
Something like a crude birth indicator.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#9:1>
Marietta had walked by herself to the delivery room because all the
pain in the world could not bring her to curse her husband, so the doctors
thought she was doing OK.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#10:1>
According to her, she felt the head drilling its way out of her when
everybody else was busy trying to calm a woman who vowed to run over her
husband 's ugly pet dog as soon as she got better, or something more tragic
than that, you bastard.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#11:1>
With no one to attend to her, Marietta slipped sideways out of her
creaky bed and tried to imagine herself walking with a delicate balloon
between her legs: must not fall, must not burst either.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#12:1>
In the delivery room, she helped herself onto a pale green table with
some of the paint coming off but nevertheless looking stable, and drawing all
her strength from all the divinities she could think of, screamed for a
doctor to fucking pull her child out and into this beautiful world.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#13:1>
Marietta always told this story with such humor that Inez was
practically rolling with laughter despite the size of her own inflated
stomach. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#14:1>
But things weren't funny now.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#15:1>
She, Inez, was in a labor room, alone in all her privacy, wide-eyed
with fear, pain, discomfort, anxiety, excitement--you name it.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#16:1>
Her room was not a stuffy pen but, rather, a bright and spacious
private room with a long sofa, pink curtains, a TV hanging over the door (
complete with cable channels) and baskets of flowers and fruits from family
and friends.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#17:1>
Her doctor was scientific in her ways, coming in to check at regular
intervals, explaining procedures in common man 's terms, and not relying on
screamed violence.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#18:1>
Her husband, Emilio, would be in any moment, tired from work but
nevertheless beaming with pure excitement.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#19:1>
She counted all these, all her blessings, and she couldn't help but
wish she were sharing the room with nine other women, screaming bloody hell
and sweating in buckets so she could at least think of this whole child
delivering thing as funny and alleviate the pain.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#20:1>
But for Inez, things weren't funny now. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#21:1>
Even <mention> <it> The Muppet Show </it> </mention> which never
failed to send her reeling with laughter, was not funny now.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#22:1>
Still, she stared up at the TV, picking absently at the hospital tag
on her wrist.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#23:1>
She wished her husband were at her side at the moment, and then she
wished he 'd stop chatting in the hallway with the other mothers and then she
wished her mother would chat till she dropped dead, too.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#24:1>
She wanted ice cream and later she imagined herself pouring it over
that sexy nurse 's head, the one who came checking on her whenever her
husband was around.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#25:1>
She imagined her child as looking like Miss Piggy and at last, she
had a good laugh.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#26:1>
In an all too quick shift, she was knocking on wood, making signs of
the cross in fear of her child actually looking like Miss Piggy.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#27:1>
Or Kermit the Frog, if it were a boy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#28:1>
She glanced at the small radio-clock beside a small basket of
daisies and zinnias on the nighttable.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#29:1>
Her husband would walk in any minute now and a little later, Inez was
sure, so would that sexy nurse.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#30:1>
Her father, popularly known as simply <mention> &ldquo; Teddy &rdquo;
</mention> to all his AM radio listeners, made his visits as scarce and as
brief as possible, making a thousand phone calls a day instead.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#31:1>
His excuse for not being too visible around the hospital was that he
wouldn't want to be caught in the actual moment of delivery because if he
did, then what would poor Emilio 's role be? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#32:1>
In truth, however, ( and this everybody knew) Teddy just didn't
particularly enjoy the idea of resurrecting memories long dead: he had taken
a very-pregnant-with-their-first-child Marietta to a friend 's housewarming
and that 's when their first child decided to make her very untimely entrance
to the world.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#33:1>
It was impatiently making its way out and the look on Marietta 's
extremely pained face petrified Teddy, particularly his jaws and knees.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#34:1>
He was in shock and remained so until way after Marietta had been
rushed off to the hospital by the on-lookers, who after realizing Teddy 's
instant paraplegia, put their cocktails away and decided to take matters into
their own hands.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#35:1>
Teddy had to be assisted, not unlike an invalid, all the way to the
hospital where for a full minute he couldn't recognize his own
parents-in-law.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#36:1>
All this in front of his colleagues who, till then, had unwavering
faith in the hard-hitting mental alertness of Teddy, the great radio
commentator whose breakfast specialty was tearing into pieces each new
Presidential Decree.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#37:1>
Whenever he could help it, he was never again publicly around a
nine-month pregnant woman.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#38:1>
Not his wife.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#39:1>
Not his daughter. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#40:1>
It was this evasion of what seemed to Inez as her father 's
cowardly fear of his credibility being undermined and by something so small
and fragile that she demanded Emilio be around her at all times.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#41:1>
Emilio, on the other hand, was more eager to prove to Inez that he
was in no way as weak as Teddy and was confident of his own strength.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#42:1>
At night, lying on the hospital sofa, while Inez lay asleep, Emilio
would bring out a small booklet for him to work on.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#43:1>
It was a present from his father, which was entitled <mention>
&ldquo; Exercises in the Development of Mind Presence. &rdquo; </mention>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#44:1>
Unlike their father, Inez 's two older sisters, Clarissa and
Jasmine ( a self-given-and-imposed-on-everybody-else nickname, because,
according to her, it was an absolute injustice to call a <quote> &ldquo;
woman of the ' 90s &rdquo; </quote> Violetta which was practically a
grandmother 's name), both unmarried by choice, visited often.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#45:1>
They 'd come and comment on the curtains, the lighting, the lousy
service ( confusing the place with the hotels where they frequently lunched),
bringing bouquets of yellow roses, mangoes and bright red apples.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#46:1>
They 'd eat the fruits themselves, tuck their legs beneath them on
the couch and watch TV.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#47:1>
She would watch them come and go with envy at their trim figures and
slim cut power suits with boyfriends in tow and meetings to hurry to.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#48:1>
Sometimes she wished she led the kind of life her sisters did and
sometimes she pitied them and their careers which were dedicated to no one
but themselves.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#49:1>
Sometimes she would stop wishing for anything. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#50:1>
Sometimes she would think back to when Jasmine very subtly tried
to dissuade her from getting pregnant by saying, <quote> &ldquo; It 's your
stretch marks. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#51:1>
As if stretch marks spelled one 's doom and maybe for Jasmine 's
mentality stemmed from her being a public figure--anchorwoman for the health
and fitness portion of the daytime TV show <it> It 's Your Life, Girl! </it>
- - and, ultimately, from their father.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#52:1>
But what Inez could not understood was how anyone could not want
children.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#53:1>
Defensively and trying to look hurt, Jasmine would always say,
<quote> &ldquo; You make it sound like I 'm some kind of monster.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#54:1>
Of course I want children and if they came with a single blow of the
nose, or a fart, for God 's sake, I 'd probably have two dozens of them.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#55:1>
One for each retirement year. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#56:1>
Then she 'd pop another cod-liver oil capsule inside her mouth for
better, clearer skin, healthier hair, and an all-around younger-looking you!
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#57:1>
Inez 's eldest sister, Clarissa, was something else.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#58:1>
Although she wasn't as figure-conscious as Jasmine, she kept herself
trim and unpregnant, but for different reasons.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#59:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Joe desperately wants to get married and he 's been
at this pleading business for <it> years </it> I think he ought to bleed some
more, &rdquo; </quote> Clarissa would say before guffawing, not realizing
that no one in the dining table has joined her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#60:1>
Everybody was busy wondering how much longer her boyfriend, Joe,
would have to wait and bleed.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#61:1>
It had been five years since Joe started proposing marriage to
Clarissa and the man was now practically anemic, going about life with
bloodshot eyes as if he could see Clarissa 's biological clock sitting on her
head, ticking away with the years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#62:1>
He was quiet during their visits to Inez and there was a faraway
wistfulness in his eyes.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#63:1>
Inez would catch him staring at her mountain of a stomach as if he
could see what beauty lay inside, or sometimes absently toying with the
rattles Emilio 's friends had given in advance.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#64:1>
Clarissa, who admitted taking up the cause of all the women who
suffered at the hands of commitment-dodging men, was punishing the poor guy,
who, Inez believed, was one hell of a masochist for sticking it out with her
oldest sister. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#65:1>
Inez would then stop thinking and start reproaching herself for
not feeling so self-assured during what could be the most enlightening and
life-changing experience of her life.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#66:1>
Then she would fall asleep. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#67:1>
Not today, though.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#68:1>
It was 5:47 according to the radio-clock.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#69:1>
The sexy nurse was more than ten minutes late and so was Emilio.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#70:1>
The pain around her stomach was becoming sharper and sharper and
there was no one else in the room.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#71:1>
Not her mother, not her Lamaze partner.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#72:1>
Aloud, she asked herself where Emilio could be.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#73:1>
Very much louder, and very piercingly, she demanded to know whether
her husband was going to show up any minute or not because if he wasn't, HE
COULD ALWAYS GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE MARRIAGE!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#74:1>
And that 's when the nurses burst in. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#75:1>
The pain she was feeling now wasn't like the ones she had been
feeling during the past few days.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#76:1>
Now it was about twenty times worse and she could almost hear her
child saying, <quote> &ldquo; I 'm coming out.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#77:1>
Gangway! &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#78:1>
Despite the numbing pain, the very annoying fact that neither the
nurse nor Emilio was around, and the speed at which she was being wheeled to
the delivery room, Inez managed to think of what her mother had been telling
her along with all those childbirth stories: <quote> &ldquo; You never ask
yourself if it 's worth all your pain.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#79:1>
It just has to happen. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#80:1>
While Clarissa and Jasmine preferred to hear their father talk
politics and current events, Inez had listened to their mother whose words
she was remembering now.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#81:1>
Words that were as reassuring as anesthesia in this her time of pain,
panic and confusion. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#82:1>
Emilio 's father, Justo, was never referred to as <mention>
&ldquo; poet &rdquo; </mention> and definitely not <mention> &ldquo;
storyteller, &rdquo; </mention> except when it came to narrating his son 's
birth, the coming to the world of Emilio, his first-born, his pride and joy
who came to the world covered in blood and whatever else his wife Elsa had
inside her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#83:1>
Whatever it was, the color and smell were intriguing, reminiscent of
something--this part he left out in Elsa 's presence.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#84:1>
But alone with his son Emilio, Justo would go into great detail,
covering absolutely everything that came in through his five senses and
registered in his brain where it remained forever engraved.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#85:1>
Interestingly, something new was added each time the story was told.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#86:1>
Something his eyes saw, ears heard, nose smelled, hands touched,
heart felt.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#87:1>
Emilio used to wonder where all these new features were coming
from--a sudden burst of memory, perhaps? - - but as he grew older, smiled
instead with deep understanding.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#88:1>
The story, however, was not so much about Emilio but about Justo
himself and how he, at the end of it all, fainted with a smile on his lips.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#89:1>
By age seventeen, Emilio stopped wondering how his father knew he was
smiling when he was supposed to be unconscious. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#90:1>
It was a rainy night ( Elsa would insist otherwise), Justo would
begin, and he was tucking his legal papers away, clearing his desk of drafts
for petitions of three different clients.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#91:1>
It was about midnight and he was working hard, you see, until his
head just fell with grogginess and that was when he decided to wake up at 4
a.m. while the rest of this side of the world still savored sleep, to
continue his work.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#92:1>
After clearing his papers away, he took his coffee and started up the
stairs with his eyes half-closed when Elsa, from the upstairs bedroom, let
out a scream so loud he was sure her voice box had exploded.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#93:1>
He dropped the cup and saucer on the stairs, splattering hot coffee
all over his legs, but what the hell: his wife was calling, screaming out his
name.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#94:1>
He kicked the door open, dismantling the doorknob system, ( Elsa,
whenever present, would always inject that it was an unnecessary but
otherwise touching act--the door was unlocked) and found his wife sitting on
the floor by the nighttable, bathed in her own sweat and tears, legs wide
open as if something, or someone, would come crawling out.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#95:1>
At first, Justo admitted he was immobile.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#96:1>
He had been waiting for this moment all his married life, praying
every day for a son ( and several other specifications that it was almost
embarrassing to God), a happy and safe delivery, and that moment--and its
success, he felt, was up to him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#97:1>
He, the great promising young lawyer whom the senior partners looked
to for fresh ideas, was for one of the rarest moments in his life left
standing at the door after having just kicked it out of the way, wide-eyed
and frozen.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#98:1>
It was only until Elsa, screaming with double intensity, instructed
him to call the doctor who lived three blocks away and didn't have a phone,
that Justo finally budged.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#99:1>
Elsa 's voice rang in his ears and he wordlessly flew down the steps,
hesitant as he was to leave his wife.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#100:1>
The household, awakened by the racket, were at the bottom of the
stairs and he sent the younger one to fetch the doctor while the older one,
<indig> Manang </indig> Dessa, who had scrubbed him as a boy, calmly marched
up the stairs, informing a wild-eyed Justo that she knew about these things
and that she had watched her mother perform child deliveries, even actually
helping out.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#101:1>
Hands on.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-014#102:1>
Justo, under normal circumstances, would acquire this &ldquo;
convince me &rdquo; attitude that lawyers always have, but at that moment, he
would have believed it if a twelve-year-old girl had told him that she could
deliver his wife 's baby while balancing a lighted candle on her head. </p>
</I>
