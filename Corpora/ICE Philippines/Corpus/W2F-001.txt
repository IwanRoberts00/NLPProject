<h> <bold> The Most Beautiful Woman in the Island </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#2:1>
<bold> Cristina Pantoja-Hidalgo </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#3:1>
Whenever he could get away, the young man would go sailing or
fishing.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#4:1>
He had never learned to swim and was actually afraid of the sea.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#5:1>
But something drew him to its icy blue depths and wayward breezes.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#6:1>
This obsession puzzled the young man 's family.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#7:1>
Unable to explain it to each other, they called it a caprice, a whim,
something the young man was entitled to, after all, considering how exemplary
he was in every other way. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#8:1>
Alejandro - - for that was the young man 's name - - had been born
to great privilege, and had come of age amidst prodigious expectations, all
of which he seemed destined to fulfill.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#9:1>
For he was immensely gifted.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#10:1>
Indeed, it was as if all the good fairies in the land had been in
attendance at his birth, and had sprinkled stardust over his crib, as in that
old tale about the sleeping princess. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#11:1>
From earliest boyhood, he had shown remarkable talent for a great
many different things.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#12:1>
Other children followed him willingly.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#13:1>
Grown-ups trusted him unquestioningly.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#14:1>
And when he began to go to school, he absorbed very quickly and very
easily what took his classmates many long hours to learn. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#15:1>
As he grew into young manhood, expectations about Alejandro
became even greater.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#16:1>
His mother had decided that he should be a doctor.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#17:1>
She believed Medicine to be the noblest profession, and considered
her son admirably suited for it.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#18:1>
Thus, Alejandro was dutifully doing a difficult pre-medical course,
and would, in time, be admitted into his university 's prestigious medical
college. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#19:1>
His father had decided that Alejandro should also eventually take
over the family 's financial empire.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#20:1>
He had discovered that his son seemed able to turn whatever he
touched to gold, like the king in that other old tale.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#21:1>
Thus, Alejandro obligingly spent his summers in his father 's
offices, serving time as apprentice king. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#22:1>
His fianc&eacute;e, Inez - - a maiden as beautiful, well-born and
well-bred as Alejandro himself - - wanted Alejandro to devote himself to art.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#23:1>
For Alejandro wrote poetry, painted watercolor landscapes, played the
piano and the guitar, even sang lead for a rock band.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#24:1>
And she fancied herself in the role of muse to his creative genius.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#25:1>
His uncle, the bishop, believed that Alejandro should use his
tremendous gifts in helping the unfortunate, for only with a life of totally
selfless dedication could he possibly repay the good Lord for the
multifarious blessings bestowed upon him. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#26:1>
His friends - - including his best friend, Eric - - were
convinced that Alejandro should become a statesman, and solve the enormous
problems besieging his little country, for if Alejandro could not do it, who
could? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#27:1>
For the first twenty years of his life, Alejandro had been
impervious to these contradictory demands.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#28:1>
Though aware of them, he had not taken them seriously.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#29:1>
One man obviously could not be everything that everyone wanted him to
be.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#30:1>
In the meantime, he was simply enjoying life. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#31:1>
But after his twentieth birthday, a change took place in
Alejandro.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#32:1>
He grew restless and troubled.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#33:1>
Unaccustomed to any form of disquiet, he could not understand it.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#34:1>
Nor did he know how to cope with it.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#35:1>
What had formerly given him pleasure now seemed to cause him only
pain.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#36:1>
Like his sports car, and his charge accounts, and his outstanding
school record, and the attentions which the ladies continued to favor him
with.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#37:1>
He began to avoid the country clubs and the hotel discos where his
friends spent their weekends.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#38:1>
He resigned from his band.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#39:1>
Soon his social life was limited to the student organizations he
belonged to.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#40:1>
But even these no longer gave him any satisfaction. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#41:1>
His family, his friends, his fianc&eacute;e were bewildered.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#42:1>
Had one fairy been forgotten?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#43:1>
Was happiness, perhaps, the gift withheld? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#44:1>
His father, at a loss for something that would amuse the son and
heir, or at least distract him from his demons, presented Alejandro with a
boat.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#45:1>
The good man had forgotten that Alejandro did not know how to swim.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#46:1>
Alejandro himself had never figured out why he could not swim.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#47:1>
Was there a childhood trauma?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#48:1>
A genetic disability?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#49:1>
This flaw in him gave him curious satisfaction.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#50:1>
He did not bother to scrutinize this.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#51:1>
Nor did he question the dangerous lure of the sea. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#52:1>
He had named his sleek white boat <mention> Tania </mention> ,
partly because of the Danish baroness who had a farm in Africa and wrote the
most beautiful stories he had ever read; but mostly because he knew no woman
called Tania. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#53:1>
The sea Alejandro sailed in was usually a mild one.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#54:1>
Stretched out, shirtless and hatless, on the Tania 's deck, his
cigarettes and a bottle of chilled beer within easy reach, he would often
drift off to sleep, lulled by the gentle lapping of the waves, carried by it
to the edges of a dream, which, however, always eluded him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#55:1>
He felt no impatience over this, he who had grown impatient over so
many things.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#56:1>
Somehow, he knew that one day, the sea would allow him to enter the
dream.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#57:1>
And then he would understand. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#58:1>
He would understand what he had only now begun to discover.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#59:1>
He would understand why he was different, so different from everyone
else he knew, that it seemed he was always alone.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#60:1>
And why, though he had been given so many gifts, none of them brought
him joy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#61:1>
This went on for two years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#62:1>
One day in April, while Alejandro was at the wheel of the
<mention> Tania </mention> , it struck him that the sea had grown so calm
that the boat seemed to be drifting just above the water.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#63:1>
The air was cooler and permeated with a fragrance he could not name.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#64:1>
The light had altered, and it seemed to Alejandro that everything
around him - - including the boat itself - - had become translucent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#65:1>
Then he saw the island.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#66:1>
It loomed suddenly before him, already so close that it might have
emerged from the sea before his eyes.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#67:1>
Astonished, Alejandro reached for his map, certain that he had never
seen this island before, though he had sailed in this part of the sea often
enough.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#68:1>
When he could not find it on his map, he concluded that he had
strayed off course, and was now in unexplored territory. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#69:1>
Eric, who had been asleep in the cabin, and had been roused when
Alejandro had dropped anchor and switched off the boat 's engine, came up on
deck. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#70:1>
Alejandro spoke without thinking, and in speaking, discovered his
own intentions.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#71:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I have to spend a little time here, Eric, &rdquo;
</quote> he said.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#72:1>
<quote> &ldquo; You take the <mention> Tania </mention> home and come
back for me in thirty days, all right? &rdquo; </quote>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#73:1>
And, after some demurring, Eric acquiesced, having always done as
Alejandro wished. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#74:1>
It was a wide beach, with sand as fine as sugar, sloping up to
where a fringe of trees came down to meet it.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#75:1>
Alejandro began to climb, following urgency he could not recall ever
feeling in his life.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#76:1>
As he climbed, he realized that the island was a mountain, thickly
wooded with trees so tall that the distant canopy of their arched branches
seemed like a second sky. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#77:1>
Presently, he came to a pebbled path, which wound its way between
low shrubs and patches of wildflowers.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#78:1>
Alejandro decided to follow it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#79:1>
After he had climbed a long time, he noticed that the trail had
widened into an ordinary country road, and that it had grown less steep.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#80:1>
But the breeze rustling through the trees was colder and stronger.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#81:1>
Suddenly the road levelled off, and Alejandro found himself
standing in a small clearing and looking down on a town, nestling among soft
green hills.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#82:1>
In the gauze-like mist, shapes and colors looked nebulous, seemed to
waver, dissolve, and re-emerge.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#83:1>
Alejandro made out brick cottages with slanted grey roofs, little
lemon-colored shops, a white church perched on a hill, a lake ringed by
weeping willows, and everywhere, crowded into beds, climbing up posts,
spilling from balconies, rainbow-hued flowers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#84:1>
He followed the road down to where it became the town 's neatly
paved main street.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#85:1>
It took him past some small shops, and brought him to a little brown
inn around the comer from a park. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#86:1>
Inside the inn 's dim lobby, a spidery-looking gentleman sitting
behind a wooden counter peered incuriously at Alejandro over thick
spectacles, and indicated the place in his ledger where Alejandro was to sign
his name. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#87:1>
Then, Alejandro walked back to the main street, and bought
himself a few clothes, some writing paper, a ball pen, a toothbrush, and a
fresh pack of cigarettes.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#88:1>
He passed a music store on his way back to the inn, and, as an
afterthought, decided to buy a guitar. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#89:1>
The next few days Alejandro spent wandering around the hills that
surrounded the little town, tracing footpaths where they led him, stopping by
meandering streams, eating simple meals in whichever roadside food stand he
found himself close to when it would occur to him that he was hungry.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#90:1>
He rose at dawn, when the town was still wrapped in an opalescent
haze, and returned to his room shortly after nightfall, tired but tranquil,
to sleep deeply and dreamlessly until the next day.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#91:1>
He never thought of his home or his parents, or of his
fianc&eacute;e, Inez, or of his best friend, Eric. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#92:1>
He could not have said what he was looking for or waiting for.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#93:1>
During his long walks under the ancient trees, he did not even think
of anything in particular.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#94:1>
Mostly, he smoked and watched the dragonflies and the butterflies
darting among the flowers in the dappled sunlight.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#95:1>
But he knew, with more certainty than he had ever felt before, that
he was where he had to be. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#96:1>
One morning, having risen earlier than usual, and discovered a
narrow road leading away from the more travelled one and up a low hill,
Alejandro found himself in front of a tall, intricately embellished iron
gate.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#97:1>
A drive curved away from it and lost itself in a tangle of vines and
trees.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#98:1>
Alejandro gripped the gate 's bars, sensing the change in him, the
breath quickening, a pulse beating...

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#99:1>
But the gate was locked. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#100:1>
That evening, he questioned the innkeeper about the tall gate at
the end of the narrow road. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#101:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Oh yes, &rdquo; </quote> the innkeeper said,
<quote> &ldquo; it 's the old house.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#102:1>
It has been there a long time.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#103:1>
No one remembers who built it though. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#104:1>
Alejandro asked whether anyone lived in it now. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#105:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Yes," </quote> the innkeeper said, <quote>
&ldquo; Mrs. Monteverde. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#106:1>
But he did not know much about her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#107:1>
She did not come into town at all, except for evening mass now and
then.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#108:1>
Some said she was ill.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#109:1>
Others said she was simply strange.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#110:1>
She had a maid and a driver, an old Chinese couple who came to town
to do the marketing, a taciturn sort, not given to gossiping with the
townspeople.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#111:1>
He could not recall when she had moved in - - a year ago, maybe two.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#112:1>
Nor did he know where she had come from.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#113:1>
No one really knew. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#114:1>
The next day, and the day after, Alejandro returned to the tall
gate at the end of the narrow road, as irresistibly drawn to it as he had
been drawn to the sea.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#115:1>
Both times he found it locked. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#116:1>
One afternoon, as he trudged up the narrow road, his hands deep
in the pockets of his new jacket, he saw a butterfly poised above a low bush.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#117:1>
Its delicate wings were the color of lilacs sprinkled with gold
dust, and in the sunlight, they looked iridescent.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#118:1>
The lovely creature hovered before him, seemed about to perch on his
left shoulder, then it fluttered away.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#119:1>
Alejandro knew that the old gate would finally be open.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#120:1>
And it was. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#121:1>
The drive led him through a garden which had been allowed to
grow wild, a garden much shaded and shadowed by enormous ferns, and vines
with cascading blossoms like amethysts and garnets, and immensely tall trees
around whose trunks were twined plants sprouting strange blooms with long
pistils and velvety, topaz-streaked petals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#122:1>
And, almost hidden from view, stood the house - - a
three-storied mansion of a design Alejandro did not recognize, knowing only
that it looked very old and stately and serene, with its colonnades and
gables, its arched doorways and bay windows and overhanging balconies.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#123:1>
He imagined that behind the shuttered windows, there would be dim,
lofty rooms, old silk and damask faded portraits in ornate frames.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#124:1>
And the lady of the house would descend a sweeping staircase under a
dripping crystal chandelier, wearing lace and pearls. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#125:1>
Meanwhile, he was circling the house, listening to his own
footsteps on many layers of dried leaves, and gazing, bemused, at a little
stone angel drooping forlornly over a broken fountain... at a frail wooden
bridge arching over what may have been a stream, long since gone dry, and
leading inexplicably into an overgrown hedge... </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#126:1>
And suddenly, there she was - - the lady of the house!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#127:1>
For it could only be she, he thought.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#128:1>
Mrs. Monteverde.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#129:1>
This woman could not possibly be the maid. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#130:1>
But she wore no lace or pearls.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#131:1>
She was dressed in a loose, white, long-sleeved cotton blouse, grey
slacks, dark glasses and a large-brimmed straw hat.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#132:1>
She had been bending over some potted plants, and now came towards
him, one hand holding a trowel, apparently as unperturbed as the innkeeper by
Alejandro 's unannounced appearance in her garden. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#133:1>
She stood there - - outlined against the ruddy glow of the
setting sun - - waiting quietly as he stammered through his apology, the
explanation which, he realized, was barely coherent.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#134:1>
And when he had finished, she said softly, <quote> &ldquo; Never
mind.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#135:1>
You will have tea with me. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#136:1>
She led the way to a terrace behind the house.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#137:1>
Though he had not yet recovered from the audacity of his own
intrusion, it struck Alejandro that she moved with the languid, fluid grace
of the sea gulls which sometimes flew over his boat as he fished.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#138:1>
And as he followed her, he caught the scent of jasmines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#139:1>
The air here seemed to capture and hold fragrance.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#140:1>
And there was about the place the same strange translucence that had
struck him at sea, just before he saw the island. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#141:1>
Alejandro realized that here, wildness had given way to order
and grace and harmony.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#142:1>
Flowers had been coaxed into beds, trimmed into hedges, banked
around trees.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#143:1>
Bushes were pruned.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#144:1>
Paths were laid.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#145:1>
Someone with an eye for the rightness of things had arranged colors
and lines and textures into the happiest combinations.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#146:1>
But why, he wondered, had so much care been lavished on the back
yard, and so much neglect inflicted on the front garden? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#147:1>
They sat on old carved chairs, facing each other across a small
marble-topped table, and she served him tea with a trace of lemon and
fragrant spices, in small handless porcelain cups the color of old ivory.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#148:1>
She had taken off her hat, and he saw that her hair was long and
straight and very dark, tied back from her face with a slender strip of black
velvet.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#149:1>
And, as he took the first sip of his tea, she removed her dark
glasses, and he found himself looking into her eyes, which were as cool and
clear as the morning when he had first walked up the narrow road and
discovered her gate. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#150:1>
Later, Alejandro could not recall what they had said to each
other.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#151:1>
He had the vague feeling that he must have done most of the talking,
while the lady listened, sitting very still, with one elbow resting on the
arm of her chair, and a smile lurking in the corners of her mouth.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#152:1>
He had asked her if he might return, but he knew beforehand what her
answer would be. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#153:1>
So Alejandro 's life in the island acquired a new pattern.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#154:1>
Every day, wherever his perambulations took him, he always presented
himself at Maria Monteverde 's garden at the hour before sunset, when she
would have finished tending her plants and would be ready for tea. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#155:1>
Sometimes they took it in the terrace, as on that first
afternoon.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-001#156:1>
And sometimes under a large mango tree in the garden, from whose
branches hung a woven hammock, in which she liked to half sit and half lie,
while he leaned against the tree 's trunk, smoking, or stretched out on the
grass, transferring his gaze from the incandescent sky to her face and back
to the sky again. </p> </I>
