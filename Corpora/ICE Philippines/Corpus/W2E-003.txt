<h> <bold> The high cost of health care </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#2:1>
It is often said that health is wealth, but there is another
reason for keeping healthy in this country: the high cost of health care.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#3:1>
Surgery, cancer treatment, dialysis and other modes of treatment for
life-threatening illnesses are way beyond the reach of millions of Filipinos.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#4:1>
Even more common drugs, however, are still too expensive for poor
families, which could partly account for continuing deaths from treatable
ailments such as dengue and even diarrhea. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#5:1>
Can pharmaceutical products be made more affordable?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#6:1>
Lawmakers say that prices of several branded products in the
Philippines are much higher compared with those in other countries.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#7:1>
The lawmakers say that paracetamols and drugs used to fight infection,
for example, are more expensive here than in Bangladesh, Hong Kong, India,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#8:1>
Some Filipinos who go on vacation in the United States bring home
supplies of vitamins and other pharmaceutical products because the goods are
much cheaper there. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#9:1>
In an effort to bring down medicine prices, the government is
pushing for the sale of generic drugs.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#10:1>
A lawmaker pointed out that you can buy a box containing 100 pieces
of 500-milligram generic erythromycin for just &peso;217 while brand names of
the same product are sold at &peso;1,000 to &peso;3,000.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#11:1>
Brand names of paracetamol, on the other hand, are retailed at prices
five to 10 times higher than their generic equivalent, it was pointed out.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#12:1>
Generic drugs, however, will take some getting used to for
Filipinos who believe that different brands of the same generic medicine have
different efficacy.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#13:1>
When a doctor specifies a brand name in a prescription, a patient
buys that brand and not its generic equivalent.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#14:1>
The government will have to make a more aggressive push for the
Generics Law in this country.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#15:1>
Apart from this, the government can review the pricing system for
pharmaceutical products to determine why they are cheaper in neighboring
countries.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#16:1>
There must be a way of bringing down medicine prices without driving
away the drug manufacturers.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#17:1>
Health is wealth, and proper health care should not make a person
impoverished. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Mayhem before Independence Day </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#19:2>
Can independence be associated with hell?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#20:2>
It can, when the dry run for the Independence Day parade ties up
traffic throughout western Metro Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#21:2>
For most of the day yesterday, vehicles crawled along all roads
leading to the Rizal Park, where participants in the Independence Day parade
tomorrow had decided to conduct their dry run without informing the public
beforehand.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#22:2>
Three vital lanes were closed to traffic to make way for the tanks,
floats and participants from the different military, police and government
contingents.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#23:2>
Some traffic officials said they had asked the Armed Forces to bring
in their tanks on a Sunday, but the military opted for maximum mayhem and
picked a busy schoolday, informing traffic cops only at the last minute. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#24:2>
The chaos yesterday can be forgiven if it was the first time it
had happened.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#25:2>
Patriotism does entail a bit of sacrifice, and we 're supposed to be
celebrating the 99th year of our declaration of independence.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#26:2>
But this havoc each time the government prepares for the Independence
Day parade has been torturing the public for the past several years now.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#27:2>
And each time, the same things happen: the military refuses to inform
even traffic cops that their cadets, soldiers, tanks and armored personnel
carriers are about to roll into Manila; D-day ( dry run day) is usually a
weekday, probably to save on overtime pay; even traffic cops are taken by
surprise, so alternate routes are improvised, usually when the traffic is
already hopelessly tied up.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#28:2>
By the time the dry run ended yesterday, it was 5 p. m., the start of
the rush hour. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#29:2>
There is historical significance in staging the parade at the
former open field where national hero Jose Rizal was executed.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#30:2>
The inconvenience to motorists is minimal; June 12 is a national
holiday, and the public is always well informed about the rerouting of
traffic for the celebrations at the Rizal Park.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#31:2>
But can't the dry run be staged in one of the military camps, which
have similar grandstands?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#32:2>
At Fort Bonifacio, those tanks and mounted artillery need not travel
too far.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#33:2>
Is it too complicated to simulate the parade 's path?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#34:2>
Movements in the parade are no <foreign> pas de deux </foreign> ;
participants must simply get from one point to the other, north to south.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#35:2>
This annual dry run is traffic mismanagement at its classic best.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#36:2>
It highlights the result of lack of coordination among government
offices.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#37:2>
It also betrays a disregard for the public 's welfare.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#38:2>
And some officials wonder why people no longer bother to watch the
Independence Day parade. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> A new chapter in RP-Singapore relations </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#40:3>
With a handshake to seal their countries ' renewed friendship,
President Ramos bade farewell yesterday to Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#41:3>
Some groups tried to make an issue of the arrest of yet another
Filipina in Singapore, but otherwise no major turbulence greeted Goh upon his
arrival this week for his long-delayed state visit here.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#42:3>
Singapore 's prime minister must have already anticipated the
relatively trouble-free reception.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#43:3>
Last November, no one bothered him when he attended the leaders '
summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Manila and Subic.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#44:3>
This could have been due to the distraction provided by other
Asia-Pacific leaders.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#45:3>
But it could also have been because Filipinos have put their
bitterness behind them.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#46:3>
And although the execution of Flor Contemplacion had not been
forgotten, Filipinos were ready to move on. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#47:3>
Goh, however, is taking no chances.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#48:3>
At the start of his three-day state visit, he announced that
henceforth, Philippine pathologists will be invited to conduct the initial
autopsy on any Filipino who dies in Singapore.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#49:3>
The Philippine Embassy will also be immediately notified of any law
enforcement case involving a Filipino.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#50:3>
Other measures continue to be worked out to protect not just
Filipinos but all the other migrant workers who constitute a substantial
portion of Singapore 's labor force.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#51:3>
The ever practical Singaporeans know it serves no purpose for the
Switzerland of the East to be pictured as an oppressor of migrant workers.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#52:3>
With an accountant 's precision, they are moving to correct the
glitches in this aspect of their national life. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#53:3>
It 's a long way from flag-burning to handshakes.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#54:3>
The tumult generated in the Philippines by Contemplacion 's execution
in 1995 for the murder of fellow maid Delia Maga puzzled the dispassionate
Singaporeans.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#55:3>
Even when their flag was burned in the Philippines, however, there
was no violent reaction from Singapore.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#56:3>
And there was no gloating when American forensic experts concluded in
their autopsy on Maga that the Singaporeans were right all along.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#57:3>
Goh 's state visit to this country, however, was postponed, and the
two nations recalled their respective ambassadors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#58:3>
Both countries have learned their lessons from the Contemplacion
case.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#59:3>
Now Singapore 's leader has come and gone, profuse in his praise for
the Philippines and Filipinos.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#60:3>
<quote> <X> &ldquo; I 'm here in a way to make up for the lost time.
</X>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#61:3>
We have a lot of catching up to do, &rdquo; </quote> Goh declared.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#62:3>
His visit should mark a new and much better chapter in the relations
between the Philippines and Singapore. </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#63:4>
<h> <bold> A year before the Centennial </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#64:4>
Students of Philippine history initially get confused about the
date of Independence Day.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#65:4>
When Emilio Aguinaldo declared the country 's independence from Spain
on June 12, 1898, the Spanish colonizers were negotiating with the Americans
for the price of these islands.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#66:4>
A few months later, when the two powers finally settled on &dollar;20
million, the Philippine capital was already occupied, not by Aguinaldo 's
revolutionaries, but by US troops.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#67:4>
And the guns of US Admiral George Dewey 's naval armada were trained
threateningly on Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#68:4>
Even as Aguinaldo was defiantly proclaiming the nation 's
independence, some of his compatriots were already contemplating
collaboration with the new American colonizers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#69:4>
It took nearly half a century and a ruinous world war before the
Americans finally left their only colony.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#70:4>
And it took another 40 years before they finally shut down the
military facilities which had provided the Philippines with a security
umbrella for several decades.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#71:4>
Foreign intervention in Philippine affairs, however, did not end
there.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#72:4>
As the nation celebrated yesterday the 99th anniversary of the
declaration of independence, the Philippines still hadn't &ldquo; graduated
&rdquo; from a series of economic programs prescribed by the International
Monetary Fund. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#73:4>
Then there is the other type of independence awaited by the
people.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#74:4>
By the government 's own admission, a majority of Filipinos continue
to live in poverty.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#75:4>
The ratio of rich to poor in this country may no longer be as skewed
as in Aguinaldo 's time, but official statistics show that only a tiny
fraction of the population continues to control the nation 's wealth.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#76:4>
Economic growth, again by the government 's own admission, has been
slow in trickling down to the bottom rungs of society.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#77:4>
The Americans are gone, and the Philippines may soon exit from the
IMF program, but emancipation from poverty for millions of Filipinos remains
a distant prospect. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#78:4>
Still, there is reason to celebrate the spirit, which moved the
nation 's forefathers to declare, against great odds, that they would rid
themselves of the colonizer 's yoke.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#79:4>
At the time, the declaration of independence might have struck some
as wishful thinking or a best-efforts pledge, but the resolve to be free sent
home the message that Filipinos wanted to be captain of their own ship.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#80:4>
A year shy of the Philippine Centennial, the present generation of
Filipinos can only hope that liberation from economic want won't take another
99 years. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Go out and register - now! </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#82:5>
Filipinos need not be told how government can affect their lives.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#83:5>
In a corrupt dictatorship, citizens must worry not only about
censorship, warrantless arrests and summary executions, but also about
spiralling prices, &ldquo; crony capitalism &rdquo; and an unhealthy business
climate.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#84:5>
An incompetent leader can bring the nation to the brink of economic
ruin, inviting political instability and a breakdown in peace and order.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#85:5>
Grandstanding lawmakers can derail vital pieces of legislation.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#86:5>
And inept, corrupt local government executives can allow garbage to
pile up, traffic to be constantly snarled and flooding to get worse. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#87:5>
There has been much improvement in the years since Fidel Ramos
assumed power.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#88:5>
The lights were restored, the coup attempts ended and peace loomed in
Mindanao.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#89:5>
Fortunes were made as the economy surged forward.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#90:5>
No longer was the Philippines referred to as the sick man of Asia.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#91:5>
Yet much also remains to be corrected, repaired, constructed.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#92:5>
There is traffic to be untangled, garbage to be collected and
properly disposed of, and potable water to be piped in to households.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#93:5>
There are roads and bridges to be built, more telephone lines to be
installed.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#94:5>
There is a kidnapping problem to be addressed, an educational system
that has to be improved and a bureaucracy that has to be rid of corruption
and red tape.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#95:5>
There are local industries which must be properly prepared for full
trade liberalization. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#96:5>
How can citizens influence the way the country is run?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#97:5>
By choosing the right leaders.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#98:5>
And this can be done by participating in elections.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#99:5>
The electoral process, in turn, must be credible, and this can be
ensured through a voters ' list which has been purged of all &ldquo; ghost
&rdquo; voters, flying voters - - all the names which aren't supposed to be
there.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#100:5>
This is the purpose of the four-day national registration which
starts today.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#101:5>
From 7 a. m. to 5 p. m. today, tomorrow and next Saturday and
Sunday, all citizens at least 18 years old must register for a new voters '
list which will be used for the national elections in 1998. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#102:5>
The polls next year will determine who will manage the local
governments, who will represent the different districts in Congress, and who
will occupy 12 of the 24 seats in the Senate.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#103:5>
Even more crucial, the elections will determine who will lead the
nation in its centennial and into the next millennium.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#104:5>
The right successor to Fidel Ramos can continue the nation 's
economic recovery and turn the Philippines into a full-grown tiger.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#105:5>
But the wrong president can easily unmake all the progress
painstakingly achieved by the nation in the previous years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#106:5>
The fate of the nation is in the people 's hands.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-003#107:5>
If you want to have a say in your life, go out and register today.
