<h> Request for Exemption from the Foreign Student Fee </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#31:2>
Dear Fr. Que,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#32:2>
My son, Martin Tomas D. Bautista, is presently enrolled as a
freshman in BS Computer Science in your university for the school year
2001-2002.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#33:2>
During enrollment, he was assessed the Foreign Student Fee from which
I am now requesting an exemption.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#34:2>
This is requested on the basis that I and my whole family are
Filipino citizens, that we are not permanent residents in any other country,
and I am a Filipino expatriate, seconded by my company, <indig> Pilipinas
</indig> Shell Petroleum Corporation, to a Shell subsidiary in Malaysia for 3
years.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#35:2>
I was planning to return this year, but my contract has been extended
for another year.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#36:2>
I am therefore expected to return to Manila next year, with the rest
of my family.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#37:2>
Prior to this secondment, all my 3 children went to schools in
Manila. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#38:2>
I would be happy to provide you with any documentation that your
office would require to confirm my eligibility to be granted the exemption.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#39:2>
Thank you very much for considering this request. </p>

Dear Sirs:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#86:5>
As advised in our e-mail message of 08 October 1997, we now send
you the signed copies of our Revised Firewall Proposal based on Gauntlet from
TIS.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#87:5>
We hope you find this proposal in accordance with your requirements.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#88:5>
Please note that we have opted to propose the Silver instead of
the Bronze support level for the following reasons:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#89:5>
1. The Silver level allows for faster resolution of problems because
of the capability to log on directly into your firewall system ( this would
be critical during this first firewall installation in SCGC),

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#90:5>
2. Technical consultancy is included in the Silver level, and the

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#91:5>
3. Cost difference between the Silver and Bronze is not too
significant ( compared with Gold and Silver levels). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#92:5>
We hope that you find our revised proposal acceptable and look
forward hearing from you very soon and consequently working with you on this
project and on others in the near future. </p>

Re: Mailboxes for SGLL

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#123:7>
Mike,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#124:7>
I received your fax regarding the above subject and have sent an
e-mail to your SGLL address.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#125:7>
Since I have not received a reply I am now reverting by fax. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#126:7>
As mentioned in the note, I am trying to determine the various
options open to you and have been in correspondence with people in Rijswijk.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#127:7>
I would just like to get some additional information from you in
the meantime:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#128:7>
1. Who have you been working regarding setting up mailboxes for SGLL
staff in The Hague/Wythenshawe?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#129:7>
2. How many mailboxes in total do you foresee you would require?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#130:7>
3. Would you be amenable to having e-mail addresses that would not
have SGLL and CMB it them?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#131:7>
This could happen as the postoffice will not be located in Colombo
and would be &ldquo; part &rdquo; of another company, <foreign> e.g.
</foreign> , SSI. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#132:7>
With regards to your questions on Mobile Office, the two staff
who would have left should be de-registered under SGLL and re-registered
under their new companies.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#133:7>
The Mobile Office Competence Centre should be advised that they are
no longer part of SGLL and their accounts changed accordingly.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#134:7>
For the new arrivals, new MO software and keys should be requested
as these are normally specific to the individual. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#135:7>

Re: Invoice for SUN Licenses

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#143:8>
Andrew,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#144:8>
As mentioned in our telecon, I provide some background
information:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#145:8>
The eventual user, Shell Bangladesh, has requested Shell Services
International <foreign> Sdn. Bhd. </foreign> ( SSI) to include the amount of
the license into the total SSI invoices for the SUN implementation project
that we are doing for them.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#146:8>
Thus the address in the invoice is SSI, whereas the person who made
the order was Shell Bangladesh, Attn. Noazesh Choudhury.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#147:8>
This is why we ended up with the bill. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#148:8>
However, we have been advised that Shell Bangladesh has had some
problems with their JV partner in Bangladesh and that additional funds will
be required from their principal, which in this case is Shell Overseas
Investment B. V. ( SOIBV).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#149:8>
At this stage, we have been asked to put the project on hold until
the additional funds are received from SOIBV.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#150:8>
This has been a slow process and up to the present, we have not been
advised to proceed with the project. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#151:8>
We are now looking at a number of options:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#152:8>
- Return the software to you ( It is still in Shell Bangladesh,
unused and sealed).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#153:8>
- Send your invoice to Shell Bangladesh and let them sort this out.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#154:8>
- Have SSI pay the invoice and SSI invoices Shell Bangladesh in
accordance with the original request of Shell Bangladesh.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#155:8>
- Because of the reduced funding, the possibility exists that only
SUN Accounts will be required and the SUN Business will have to be returned.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#156:8>
What we would like now would be Systems Union advice on the
possibility of returning the software:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#157:8>
- Completely, unused and in the original packing

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#158:8>
- Partially, to make use of the SUN Accounts only.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-018#159:8>
If this is possible, please advise if there would be a deadline to
this or if there would be a corresponding penalty. </p>

<p>
