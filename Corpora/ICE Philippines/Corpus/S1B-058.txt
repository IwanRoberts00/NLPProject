<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#1:1:A>
Thank you Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#2:1:A>
Uh Mr President uh I 'd like to congratulate the distinguished gentleman uh from uh Batangas uh no less than the <,> President <foreign> Pro-Tempore </foreign> of the Senate for delivering this timely uh speech and reminder to us <.> cur </.> regarding uh what are going on in our uh current uh relationship <,> with the United States of America on security which are being uh re-examined and re-negotiated
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#3:1:A>
This is uh indeed a well thought-out speech
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#4:1:A>
And I 'd like to commend uh the distinguished uh Senator for his uh erudition and incisive uh uh articulation of uh this major uh issue in our uh country and time
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#5:1:A>
And so Mr President I would like to find out if he would care to answer a few questions

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#6:1:B>
Willingly with great pleasure Mr President

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#7:1:A>
Mr President uh after uh hearing your speech and given the depth of uh preparation that went into uh the formulation of this uh uh material I 'm sure that you must have studied the uh military security relationship of the Philippines and the United States of America which is the uh reason for the existence of military uh bases in the Philippines now being utilized by the Americans
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#8:1:A>
And uh in view of this perception uh Mr President I would like to posit this question <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#9:1:A>
In your honest uh opinion and uh belief Your uh Honor do you believe do you feel do you recommend that uh the present uh arrangement <,> with the United States of America having their troops in the Philippines occupying some uh portions of our territory to station deploy their uh military capability uh is indeed to subserve the interest the security interest of the Philippines

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#10:1:B>
Okay very obviously Mr President uh uh considering the terms even of the the Mutual Defense Agreement <.> bet </.> between the United States and the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#11:1:B>
And uh now the and the present conditions <,> I do not think that these uh agreements including the Military Bases Agreement is for the benefit <,> of the Philippines not for the defense of the Philippines not for its protection 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#13:1:B>
And uh it is I think largely in the interest of the other party
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#14:1:B>
And so much so that you find that you can derive this uh draw this conclusion from the wording that whenever there is an attack on these <,> uh military bases we 're supposed to come forward to defend them
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#15:1:B>
But when it 's just the Philippines minus the military bases they just uh they are not required obligated to come <.> fo </.> to the fore and help us
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#16:1:B>
That 's unjust unfair

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#17:1:A>
Now Your Honor thank you for that answer uh and I agree with you that uh indeed uh these uh military bases uh <,,> shorn of its uh mysticism and myth is nothing but a naked uh uh effort uh to project the uh imperial military power of uh the United States of America uh in this part of uh the world
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#18:1:A>
And so uh given this situation Your Honor my next question is this
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#19:1:A>
Right now there is a burden <,> continuing <,> obligatory burden imposed on the Philippines flowing from the uhm so-called Military Bases Agreement between the Philippines and the United States of America <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#20:1:A>
On the other hand Your Honor we are receiving quote compensation unquote from the United States of <.> Am </.> America
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#21:1:A>
I uh placed it in quotation because uh oh we 're all aware of the fact that uh this is not really the kind of a compensation that we would want uh to categorize as such in uh the law of contracts because uh whereas the burden on us is immediate direct and operating <,> the so-called uh consideration or compensation which was from the United States to the Philippines is only based on best efforts
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#22:1:A>
Do you think Your Honor that given the risk <,,> on us of getting involved in the quarrels of the United States with other countries <,> given the risk of possible uh uh use of our territories as a launching area for uh nuclear attack against other countries
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#23:1:A>
And uh I have here a statement from a well-known writer which says that uh U S forces are capable <?> to know </?> of nuclear strikes or Soviet homeland uh based or <?> home ported </?> in the regions in South Korea Japan the Philippines included it includes the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#24:1:A>
Given this Your Honor and given the possibility that we would be the object of attack because of this thing
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#25:1:A>
Do you think that the present compensation package or even the compensation package that the group of Secretary Manglapus uh is now uh asking the Americans to pay to us for the continuation of military the American military presence in the Philippines is commensurate to all the burdens and risks that we are assuming
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#26:1:A>
Given also the fact that America could be a threat directly to our country and people

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#27:1:B>
Well uh that question had long been answered uh by one of our great Filipino nationalists uh <foreign> Don </foreign> Claro <foreign> eme </foreign> <&> Spanish pronunciation of M </&> Recto
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#28:1:B>
His answer to that question is <,,> you were actually putting these installing these military bases <.> wi </.> which will be obviously loaded with nuclear weapons which will serve as magnet to attract <,,> destructive weapons the same nuclear weapons the same type that will destroy not just that military base but even the entire country and the surrounding nations
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#29:1:B>
So the question is simply this
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#30:1:B>
Do you think it is enough to receive money to count it by the billions in exchange for the danger of to the danger of existence survival of the Filipinos
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#31:1:B>
Simply the answer Mr President is a definite <mention> no </mention> it is not sufficient as a matter of fact it cannot even be considered <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#34:1:B>
<indig> Hindi pwede 'yon <,> ano naman buhay na ang pinag-uusapan rito </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#35:1:B>
'Cause even if even if the Soviet Union or shall we say North Korea were not an enemy of ours the mere fact that we have nuclear weapons here and the United States is involved and involvement of the United States that is not in our hands we cannot stop it prevent it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#36:1:B>
And yet the minute that such a situation should arise we are in great mortal danger
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#37:1:B>
<{> <[> So <unclear> word </unclear> </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#38:1:A>
<[> <indig> Samakatuwid po </[> </{> samakatuwid po sa inyong mahalagang ah kaisipan ay 'yang tinatawag natin na mga kasunduan pang-militar sa Amerika kasunduan ng ating bansa at ng Amerika tungkol sa ah seguridad kagaya nung tinatawag natin na </indig> Mutual Defense Treaty <indig> at ganoon din ang base kasunduan tungkol sa base militar ay mas mabigat na pinapasan ng ating bansa kaysa nakagagaan sa ating kalagayan bisang bilang isang bansa </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#40:1:B>
That is true Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#41:1:B>
Uh I realize that so many of our people depend uh uh for their livelihood their source of income on the military bases near Clark Field uh Subic <,> but I think the larger interest is the entire nation <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#43:1:B>
And our own countrymen who might be uh uh prejudiced by any removal by the removal by this this uh dismantling of military of U S military bases here should be able to understand that the larger interest the general welfare is the supreme factor to be considered in the resolution of such an issue posed by the Minority Leader now

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#44:1:A>
<indig> Kayo po ba ay naniniwala na sa ngayon ay may binubuo na koalisyon ang tatlong <,> malalaking ah bayan dito sa ah Asya ah ah dalawang bayan dito sa Asya at ah kasama ang Amerika at 'yan ay ang baka bayan ng Tsina </indig> People 's Republic of China <indig> at ganoon din ang Hapon
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#45:1:A>
Eh 'yang koalisyon po na iyon ay </indig> anti-Soviet coalition
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#46:1:A>
<indig> Kayo po ba ay naniniwala diyan </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#47:1:B>
<O> chuckle </O> I understand Mr President that in the politics particularly in international politics uh anything is possible and that your enemies now may be your enemies tomorrow your friends before could you be your enemies now
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#48:1:B>
And so I think uh that uh coalition spoken of by the Minority Leader is <.> center </.> is certainly a possibility
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#49:1:B>
As proved by history <indig> totoo ho 'yan eh <,> </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#50:1:B>
The Soviet Union uh allied with the United States attended Yalta the Yalta meeting <,> against the Axis Powers including Japan and uh Italy and Germany
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#51:1:B>
And now <indig> aba iba na </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#52:1:B>
Why
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#53:1:B>
Because as stated by George Washington Mr President and before him Lord Chamberlain or no <.> Lo </.> Lord Palmerston <quote> there are no permanent friends only permanent interests national interests </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#54:1:B>
And so if it is in the interest of a particular country such as China U S and Japan to group together in a coalition for the purpose of presenting a solid front against a particular enemy rising enemy probable enemy <,> there 's nothing to stop them

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#55:1:A>
And so Your Honor uh if there 's uh that 's it if there is such uh an anti-Soviet coalition emerging between amongst the United States of America Japan and the People 's Republic of China <,> do you agree with the perception Your Honor that the Americans would like the continuation <&> break in the recording </&> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#56:1:B>
<&> missing words </&> the other uh objective or purpose because I cannot conceive of a military base Mr President nowadays in this age of uh advanced technology without military unconventional military weapons particularly nuclear weapons <,> which are becoming more uh sophisticated
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#57:1:B>
So if there is if there are military bases foreign military bases anywhere in the world <,> there must be a reason for it and that is in order for purposes of defense to serve as the first line of defense and second as the forefront the vanguard for purposes of attack against a possible enemy in the event of war

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#58:1:A>
And so therefore if there be such a a coalition and uh the the uh our Philippine military bases uh our support for that coalition Your Honor uh given the fact that about thirty-five to forty percent of uh the I I C D M force and ballistic missile firing submarines of the Soviets are actually deployed in our <.> re </.> region of the world <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#59:1:A>
And given the fact that uh there is uh a large strategic bomber capability stationed by the Soviets uh in that area in Siberia and <.> wi </.> we are within range of these uh strategic bombers don't you think Your Honor that the danger is very clear
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#60:1:A>
That if we continue the uh presence of American troops in these uh facilities that uh we could be involved in a confrontation that we may not want to be involved simply because uh we want uh uh some uh dollars and cents to shore up our bankrupt economy

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#61:1:B>
Uh obviously Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#62:1:B>
Although I can understand the uh uh the need of the country for uh dollars for money I think there should be <,> if <?> there 's a wall </?> there that should stop us already we cannot cross because that would mean mortgaging our future our posterity our nationhood

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#63:1:A>
Mr President uh uh I would like to continue the interpellation but I have uh a scheduled meeting with a distinguished visitor the uh Czechoslovakian Ambassador
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#64:1:A>
Uh and I would like to uh ask permission to <.> cala </.> stop my interpellation if there will be time I 'll continue Your Honor so that <.> oth </.> I think there are others who would want to interpellate the distinguished uh gentleman
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#65:1:A>
Thank you very much

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#66:1:C>
Senator Pimentel is recognized <,,> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#67:1:D>
Actually Mr President just a a <.> ve </.> very few points uh if His Honor will permit <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#68:1:D>
Uh is it uh correct to say that the Soviet Union is still considered an enemy of the United States <{> <[> because it 's </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#70:1:B>
<[> Not that </[> </{> uh it is not considered by the United States as an enemy but as a potential enemy and a continuing danger to its world leadership

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#71:1:D>
In spite of the fact that uh in Eastern Europe uh there is already a uh a total overhaul of governments which used to be communists and have now become uh shall we say more democratically-oriented Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#72:1:D>
And even in the Soviet Union itself <,> uh have we ever seen uh the phenomenon that we are now witnessing in the Soviet Union where Yeltsin is openly challenging Gorbachev and there are demonstrations of miners calling for the resignation of uh Gorbachev himself <{> <[> Mr President </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#73:1:B>
<[> I would agree </[> </{> Mr President with the thinking and statement of the uh Senator from Mindanao that this threat from behind the <?> garden </?> is not as serious as it used to be
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#74:1:B>
Definitely <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#75:1:B>
I think that uh with that uh <foreign> <.> glas </.> glasnost </foreign> and <foreign> perestroika </foreign> and the agitation and open rebellion of the various component republics in the Soviet Union which show that it 's certainly lacking in strength to challenge the supremacy of other world powers such as the United States but I would also call attention to the fact that it is not simply a question of of power armed strength
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#76:1:B>
There is a conflict of ideology
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#77:1:B>
There is seems to be a conflict of ideology that cannot be reconciled even as they the two countries they have uh already uh shall we say ended practically their cold war confrontation

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#78:1:D>
That is exactly what I would like to stress Mr President that uh the ideological division between the Soviet Union and the United States is disappearing if it has not already disappeared
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#79:1:D>
Uh you see Your Honor for example uh Latvia Estonia and uh Lithuania which is part of the whole Soviet Union empire these three countries have openly said they are now uh independent countries
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#80:1:D>
Now Georgia which is another state in the Soviet Union is able to assert uh at least by announcements that they would also wish to be considered an independent Soviet uh Republic
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-058#81:1:D>
Now all these things would seem to me to indicate that the Soviet ideology which uh used to be the basis of the uhm uh confrontation cold war confrontation and sometimes breaking out in actual shooting war uh in the subaltern states of the U S and the and and the Soviet Union this ideological division does not seem to be there anymore Mr President 

 </I>
