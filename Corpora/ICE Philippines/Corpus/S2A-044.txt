<I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#1:1:A>
Thank you very much and good afternoon
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#2:1:A>
Uh how many of you are familiar with N L P already
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#3:1:A>
Anything that you know about N L P <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#4:1:A>
Okay uh spelled out <indig> 'no </indig> we use N L P to really mean neurolinguistic programming
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#6:1:A>
And when we talk about neurolinguistic programming this involves looking into the nervous system
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#7:1:A>
Okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#8:1:A>
And when we talk about the nervous system we focus on the five senses that I hope you remember from your grade school years
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#9:1:A>
What are the five senses
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#10:1:A>
<indig> Bakit kayo sa </indig> touch <indig> nag-uumpisa ha </indig> <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#11:1:A>
Okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#12:1:A>
Touch
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#13:1:A>
Okay sight hearing <,> taste and smell <indig> 'no <indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#14:1:A>
Okay the idea here is that we get in touch with the world and we experience the world through the five senses
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#15:1:A>
And this is what uh the neuro aspect of N L P refers to
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#16:1:A>
So we become aware of the world we become uh familiar with many things about the world and then we respond to the world in terms also of these five senses that we have
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#18:1:A>
Okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#19:1:A>
Now the linguistic aspect focuses on the fact that we use language whether consciously or unconsciously internally or externally to represent this experience of the world that we have
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#20:1:A>
Like for instance <indig> 'no </indig> when you 're feeling warm internally you may be saying <indig> ang init naman </indig> you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#21:1:A>
Then <indig> nagpapaypay ka </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#22:1:A>
Or for instance uh a very handsome man passes by <indig> 'no </indig> you may not really be saying it verbally but internally you might say <indig> ang gwapo </indig> you know like that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#23:1:A>
So whatever comes in contact with a part of your or with one of your senses gets to be linguistically represented <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#24:1:A>
Okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#25:1:A>
And then the programming aspect means that we really systematize our responses to the various experiences that we have
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#26:1:A>
So we systematize <indig> 'no </indig> we encode and we decode certain uh messages
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#27:1:A>
Now as we grow then some aspects of responding become patterned
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#28:1:A>
That 's why it 's already programmed <indig> 'no <indig> we are sort of programmed okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#30:1:A>
Now uhm so that 's what basically the three words would mean
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#31:1:A>
Now simply speaking N L P says really that this may be the world that we really have <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#32:1:A>
Okay this is the world that we really have
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#34:1:A>
But we may not experience the world as it really is
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#35:1:A>
If this is the big world which we might be able to respond to actually we just make representations of the world or we make maps or models of the world <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#37:1:A>
Okay uh if you think about a model airplane what comes to your mind <,> huh
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#39:1:A>
Something what <,> that looks like an airplane from the outside but it 's a small version so it cannot really function the way a real airplane would <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#40:1:A>
It cannot fly or perhaps if it flies only within certain parameters or only within a certain period of time
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#41:1:A>
And it may not be able to accommodate passengers just as the real airplane would be able to <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#42:1:A>
So in a way when we make models or maps of the world the models that we make may resemble the real world but may not actually possess all the faculties or the functions of the real world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#43:1:A>
Okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#44:1:A>
Now so supposing uh you there are three of you one 's model of the world may be bigger the other one 's may be smaller and the third person 's model may be even smaller
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#45:1:A>
Now the smaller the model of our world is then the less it approximates or the less it resembles the real world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#46:1:A>
You 'll notice that <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#47:1:A>
A globe is a model of the world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#48:1:A>
<indig> Hindi ba 'yung </indig> globe has all the countries of the world and the the shapes and all that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#49:1:A>
But the smaller the globe is <indig> 'no </indig> the less countries it can contain <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#50:1:A>
Maybe the Philippines might not even be found in that small model or the small globe
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#51:1:A>
So that is it <indig> 'no <indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#52:1:A>
People develop different sizes of the models of the world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#53:1:A>
The problem is <,> some people 's model of the world may be so small <indig> 'no </indig> that it really incorporates very little of the big world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#54:1:A>
And the smaller our world model is then the more <?> tamed </?> we can be the more problems we have
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#55:1:A>
Okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#56:1:A>
Now what makes the world model small or big <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#57:1:A>
Maybe we can talk about it being smaller than the actual world model because there are constraints that we experience
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#58:1:A>
What are some of the constraints of the uh modeling process <indig> 'no <indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#59:1:A>
One would be that we have nervous system constraints 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#60:1:A>
Uh there are neurological constraints
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#61:1:A>
Like for instance <indig> 'no </indig> if I ask you right now right now at this point what are you aware of <,> okay <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#62:1:A>
Okay can you enumerate what you became aware of <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#63:1:A>
You 're aware that you 're hungry okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#64:1:A>
What about you what are you what were you aware of when I asked that <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#65:1:A>
Having a lecturer in front of you
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#66:1:A>
And what about you
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#67:1:A>
Okay you were aware that you were listening <indig> 'no </indig> okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#68:1:A>
So three of them had different areas uh <&> speaker stutters </&> uh where they were aware of or <&> speaker stutters </&> of which they were aware <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#69:1:A>
Now uh the thing is there are many things that you could have been aware of at that given moment <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#70:1:A>
Like uh some of you might have been aware of this microphone stand or the podium or the box here or the tables there the chair the chair there the lights the sound of the air conditioner the picture over there the people around you
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#71:1:A>
You could have been aware of such things
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#72:1:A>
Because they were in existence during the time that I asked you what are you aware of <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#73:1:A>
But see some of you were focused or uh just one or two items at that given moment <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#74:1:A>
According to the proponents of uh neurolinguistic <.> program </.> <.> gramming </.> Bundler <indig> 'no </indig> and Grinder we can be aware only of seven plus two chunks chunks <indig> 'no </indig> seven plus two chunks of information at any given time
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#76:1:A>
So <indig> bale </indig> a maximum of nine information at any given time <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#77:1:A>
Like and we say <mention> chunks </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#78:1:A>
Like you can say I am aware of this specific person this specific person this specific person
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#79:1:A>
You 're saying I am aware of people I am <.> aw </.> that 's a chunk of information
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#81:1:A>
I am aware of chairs <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#82:1:A>
I am aware of the sound system rather than different sounds specifically <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#83:1:A>
So at any given time we will only be aware of seven plus two chunks of information
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#84:1:A>
Therefore our nervous system already limits <indig> 'no <indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#85:1:A>
What we do not become aware of do not become part of this world model okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#86:1:A>
Now we are also limited by our language <indig> 'no </indig> uh
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#87:1:A>
Like some of you may be coming from one region another a few may come from another region and you might have different dialects <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#88:1:A>
Let us say somebody is somebody is from Iloilo <indig> 'no </indig> and he 's talking to a Tagala <indig> 'no </indig> okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#89:1:A>
Now this Ilonggo had a very very uhm fantastic experience <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#90:1:A>
And as she is describing it in Ilonggo she can describe it very very well in very very specific more felt ways
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#91:1:A>
But then this Tagala says I cannot understand what you are saying you translate it to Tagalog
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#93:1:A>
And then when she translates it to Tagalog <indig> <.> mahi </.> nahirapan siya </indig> or the meanings of the experience are lost already
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#94:1:A>
<indig> Parang </indig> it doesn't sound so good anymore
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#95:1:A>
Like for instance <indig> 'no </indig> when you say in <.> Taga </.> let 's say the Tagalogs <indig> 'no </indig> in Tagalog you say <indig> nalulungkot ako 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#96:1:A>
That 's Tagalog <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#97:1:A>
When you say <indig> nalulungkot </indig> yeah there 's a certain element of sadness and you just feel that something is missing something is lacking <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#98:1:A>
But if a person can say <indig> nawiwindang ang puso ko 'no </indig> it has it gives you a different feeling
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#100:1:A>
<indig> Di ba </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#101:1:A>
<indig> Nalulungkot </indig> there 's a certain sense of sadness <indig> kasi </indig> something is missing something is lacking
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#102:1:A>
But <indig> nawiwindang </indig> means there is something more actively eating you up or devastating you <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#103:1:A>
That 's why when you say I 'm sad rather than I am devastated it has a different meaning
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#104:1:A>
Now if you cannot use the more accurate terms to graphically describe your experiences your world model may be smaller
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#105:1:A>
Okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#106:1:A>
Now for instance I ask you what 's another word for <mention> snow </mention> <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#107:1:A>
<indig> Ano <,> yelo <,> </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#108:1:A>
<indig> Ano pa </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#109:1:A>
<foreign> Nieve </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#110:1:A>
<indig> Ano pa </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#111:1:A>
<indig> Trinanslate n'yo na sa </indig> different languages
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#112:1:A>
<indig> O ano pa </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#113:1:A>
Okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#114:1:A>
<indig> Tayo 'no </indig> we have a hard time really translating
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#115:1:A>
Some people would say another word for <mention> snow </mention> is <mention> ice </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#116:1:A>
But you make an image of ice and you make an image of snow are they the same
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#117:1:A>
<indig> Hindi ano </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#118:1:A>
<indig> Di ba </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#119:1:A>
<indig> Ganyan </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#120:1:A>
But the Eskimos <indig> 'no </indig> okay the people from Alaska they don't want to be called <mention> Eskimo </mention> anymore
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#121:1:A>
So the people <indig> 'no </indig> from the cold cold place <indig> 'no </indig> have seventy different words for snow
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#122:1:A>
So <indig> alam nila kung ano 'yung </indig> snow <indig> 'yung pwedeng paglaruan kung ano 'yung </indig> snow <indig> na pwede nilang i- </indig> expose <indig> ang sarili nila puwede ring uh lumabas 'no </indig> or go out only for necessities or don't go out at all
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#123:1:A>
They know which kind of snow would be harmful by the use of the different terms
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#124:1:A>
But we cannot find a synonym for <mention> snow </mention> because we are not exposed to snow at all okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#125:1:A>
That is the linguistic uh constraint <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#126:1:A>
And we also have what we call individual constraints in this world uh building <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#127:1:A>
Okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#128:1:A>
Why
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#129:1:A>
Because we are individuals we have unique experiences and we have unique interpretations of the experiences
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#130:1:A>
So our individual histories can affect how we will view the world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#131:1:A>
Like for instance <indig> 'no </indig> uh if you have a girl who grew up in a family <.> tha </.> where the father was very loving the mother was very caring <indig> 'no </indig> and she felt very much loved
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#132:1:A>
And you have another girl whose father abandoned them when they were young and whose mother committed suicide or attempted suicide several times <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#133:1:A>
Who would have a better outlook about relationships with the opposite sex
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#134:1:A>
The first one <indig> 'di ba </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#136:1:A>
<indig> Kasi siya 'yung tingin niya ah maganda ang </indig> marriage <indig> maganda mag- </indig> fall in love you will be happy and all that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#137:1:A>
But the other one may huh I 'm not saying automatically she would <indig> 'no </indig> but the other one may be very skeptical or very cynical about the permanency of love or the fact that love really exists <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#138:1:A>
So <indig> ang tingin nila ang ang </indig> world model <indig> nila </indig> would be different <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#139:1:A>
The other one would say oh being in love is a beautiful thing marriage is a beautiful thing
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#140:1:A>
But the other one may say marriage is a dangerous thing <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#141:1:A>
So that becomes part of their world model
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#142:1:A>
Okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#143:1:A>
Are you clear
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#144:1:A>
Okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#145:1:A>
Now those are the constraints that I said would affect the size of your world model
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#146:1:A>
Now there are also what we call uh the universals of the human modeling process
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#147:1:A>
For instance I say to you can you complete the sentence A man with a moustache is 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#149:1:A>
Can you answer that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#150:1:A>
Can you complete that sentence A man with a moustache is <,,> uhm
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#152:1:A>
For you <,> <mention> is old </mention> <,> <mention> is mature-looking </mention> <,,> uhm <mention> is big </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#153:1:A>
Okay what about this gentleman <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#154:1:A>
<mention> Is different </mention> okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#155:1:A>
What about the one beside you
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#156:1:A>
A man with a moustache is <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#157:1:A>
Just for you don't ask anybody <,,> <mention> is bad </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#158:1:A>
Next <,> <mention> masculine </mention> <,> <mention> is not a woman </mention> okay <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#160:1:A>
<indig> Kanta 'yan ng Apo Hiking ano </indig> uhm
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#161:1:A>
<indig> O ano pa <,> ha </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#162:1:A>
<mention> Good looking </mention> okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#164:1:A>
<mention> Scary </mention> okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#166:1:A>
<mention> Dirty-looking </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#167:1:A>
<mention> Old </mention> okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#169:1:A>
You notice that I asked several of you <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#170:1:A>
Two people answered old one answered mature looking
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#171:1:A>
Someone answered uh cute I heard it I overheard it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#172:1:A>
Somebody said scary
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#173:1:A>
Somebody said bad
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#174:1:A>
Somebody said good looking <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#175:1:A>
Okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#176:1:A>
You have a different kind of response <indig> 'no </indig> for each person
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#177:1:A>
Now when you see <indig> na </indig> therefore <indig> 'no </indig> depending upon the response that you gave when you see a man with a moustache what is the likely response that you will have or reaction that you will have <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#178:1:A>
<indig> Pag sinabi mong </indig> scary or bad <indig> 'no kahit na sino pa siya basta meron siyang bigote matatakot ka </indig> or <indig> iiwasan mo pag sinabi mong macho lalapitan mo 'no </indig> cute <indig> lalapitan mo di ba kahit ano pa siya
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#179:1:A>
This is what we call a generalization <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#180:1:A>
we are saying okay you 're answering once when a man with a moustache is cute
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#181:1:A>
But when you really see men with moustaches are they really cute all of them
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#183:1:A>
No <indig> di ba </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#184:1:A>
Okay are they really all bad
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#185:1:A>
<indig> Hindi naman 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#186:1:A>
Are they really all scary
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#187:1:A>
<indig> Hindi <.> nama </.> </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#188:1:A>
Are they really all macho
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#189:1:A>
<indig> Hindi naman 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#190:1:A>
So you will notice that there is a really really a difference
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#191:1:A>
But the thing is sometimes we have a generalization <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#192:1:A>
We generalize that just because a person has this attribute or an experience occurred then it will have the same outcome <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#193:1:A>
Like for instance one generalization that we can have is this <indig> kunyari <.> naglalak </.> umaakyat tayo ng hagdanan ano tapos nahulog tayo 'no tapos nabalian tayo </indig> okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#194:1:A>
Then what happens every time that you see that staircase what happens
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#196:1:A>
<indig> Natatakot ka na 'no nag-ge-generalize ka na na komo nahulog ka noon mahuhulog ka na naman hindi ba </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#197:1:A>
And you forgot perhaps the one hundred times before that you climbed up that staircase and you did not fall
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#198:1:A>
You only remember that particular time that you fell that 's why every time that you approach that staircase <indig> medyo sumasakit ang tiyan mo o kaya ingat ka hawak 'no </indig> you really hold on very very tightly <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-044#199:1:A>
Okay so you generalize
