Saudi Arabian King Fahad bin Abdulaziz al Saud has pardoned Violeta Miranda the Filipina nurse arrested for possession of <indig> shabu </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-006#14:1:A>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican says the clemency was granted as a gesture of good will vis-&aacute;-vis the upcoming visit to the Philippines of Saudi Prince Salman bin Abdulazizi

For saying that it 's not likely for the President to grant clemency to three cop killers who were given a ninety-day reprieve Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas gets a bit of tongue lashing from the President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-006#19:1:A>
But Cuevas is quick to deny the statements attributed to him
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-006#20:1:A>

In a press conference this morning Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas denies having said any of these

Cuevas says there are just some people who are pitting him and the President against each other
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-006#27:1:B>

We see brighter prospects of peace now that everything is set on the release of the remaining military captives of the New People 's Army or the N P A
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-006#41:1:A>
The government has always maintained it will go back to the negotiating table if all hostages are released
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-006#42:1:A>
Two had been released so far three more to go
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-006#43:1:A>
And it looks like the N P A will meet the April nineteen deadline
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-006#44:1:A>
But there are at least three vital points which the government panel says must be settled in order for the peace process to get underway

It will just be a temporary assignment for him
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-006#50:1:C>
Lastimoso is yet to determine where to put Bernal permanently based on the results of his two-day evaluation expected to be released tomorrow
