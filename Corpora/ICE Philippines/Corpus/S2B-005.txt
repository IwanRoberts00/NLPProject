President Estrada heeds the advice of Brother Mike Velarde and gives a ninety-day reprieve to three death convicts whose execution is scheduled tomorrow
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-005#6:1:A>
But Estrada says this does not mean he is getting soft on crime
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-005#7:1:A>
More from Tony Velasquez <,>

<ICE-PHI:S2B-005#8:1:B>
For a change it 's now the government asking for time to rethink the execution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-005#9:1:B>
Only three months ago President Estrada was extremely upset that the Supreme Court had delayed the execution of child rapist Leo Echegaray the country 's first death convict in twenty-three years
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-005#11:1:B>
Echegaray was eventually executed last February fifth
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-005#12:1:B>
The next death convicts were scheduled to die Wednesday afternoon
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-005#13:1:B>
The three men Archie Bulan Jesus Morallos and Dante Piandong were convicted for a nineteen ninety-four robbery during which they killed Caloocan City Police Officer Gerry Perez
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-005#14:1:B>
While the President was unforgiving of Echegaray he says there is still hope for the three death convicts now
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-005#15:1:B>
Estrada gave them a ninety-day reprieve to allow their cases to be reviewed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-005#16:1:B>
Even so Estrada insists the government 's stand against crime remains as strong as ever <&> a twenty second news interview clip of President Estrada </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-005#17:1:B>
Estrada 's decision was influenced mainly by his spiritual adviser <foreign> El Shaddai </foreign> leader Brother Mike Velarde
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-005#18:1:B>
Brother Mike had suggested the review of the cases to see if all three men deserve the death penalty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-005#19:1:B>
Brother Mike told the President it was inappropriate for the execution to take place so soon after the country had just finished celebrating the Holy Week
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-005#20:1:B>
The President had previously hinted he might lift the death penalty on the three convicts if their crime was committed out of poverty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-005#21:1:B>
But while such an act might be deemed humanitarian it could encourage even more criminals to use poverty as a convenient alibi to break the law

The Justice Department was not pleased with the President 's decision
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-005#24:1:A>
The Justice Secretary believes the crime committed by the three was more heinous than rape

Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas sees no reason why the execution had to be postponed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-005#27:1:C>
He said the Supreme Court had already reviewed the conviction and found sufficient evidence to carry out the death sentence on Piandong Morallos and Bulan <&> a twenty-six second news interview clip of Secretary Cuevas </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-005#28:1:C>
Cuevas said the murder of a policeman was a brazen attack on law and order that cannot go unpunished <&> a nineteen second news interview clip of Secretary Cuevas </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-005#29:1:C>
And because of these aggravating circumstances Cuevas believes that crime was more heinous than rape
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-005#30:1:C>
The three convicts said they did not know the man they shot during a <indig> jeepney </indig> robbery hold-up was a policeman
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-005#31:1:C>
Cuevas points out ignorance is not an excuse <&> a seven second news interview clip of Secretary Cuevas </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-005#32:1:C>
Cuevas says the government must not show signs of softening up on crime
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-005#33:1:C>
Tomorrow 's execution he believes would have driven home the point
