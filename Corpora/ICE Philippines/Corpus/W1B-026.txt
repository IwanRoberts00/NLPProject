Dear Sir:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-026#70:4>
This has reference to your letter dated November 16, 1996 re: the
Congressional District IV Speech Festival held at San Roque High School,
Gapan, Nueva Ecija with the following comments/information:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-026#71:4>
1. I believe you were aware that there were three original judges.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-026#72:4>
However, due to time constraints, the two contest categories ( Choric
Speaking and Chamber Theater) were conducted simultaneously; hence, the
judges were divided into two groups, taking in an additional judge in the
person of Cerelle Morrow, a Peace Corps Volunteer;

<ICE-PHI:W1B-026#73:4>
2. Speaking of Miss Morrow, while it 's true that she stays in Cabiao
her service area is the entire province of Nueva Ecija.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-026#74:4>
Having worked with her for 18 months, I believe in her fairness,
otherwise, I should not have allowed her to judge since my school was also
competing;

<ICE-PHI:W1B-026#75:4>
3. Moreover, even if we disregard the rating of Miss Morrow, Cabiao
National High School still ranks first; and

<ICE-PHI:W1B-026#76:4>
4. As per Division Memorandum No. 89, s. 1996, only the first placers
in the CCD competitions will join the Division Speech Festival. </p>

Further to our phone with Vic this morning, I am pleased to
confirm that another production studio will be equipped very soon, <foreign>
e.g. </foreign> after the delivery of the order for the News Studio.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-026#113:6>
Based on my meetings with the big bosses of the TV broadcast
company, the rehabilitation would come immediately after we shall have
equipped with new luminaires all the Studios. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-026#114:6>
Again, this means that rehab will consist of new dimmers and
controls, like ABS-CBN, and probably flying equipment. </p>

<p>

In the meantime, IBC-13 Management also needs one or two of its

Dear Mr. Garcia,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-026#181:9>
In connection with your previous interest to automate production
of your crunchy munchies product line, we are pleased to enclose our proposal

manual product placement in trays, after which the machine seals trays using
roll-film laminate, heatsealing.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-026#184:9>
Trays can be accommodated up to 10 &rdquo; square and up to 6

Smaller trays within this size can be run in dual ( tandem), thus
doubling production speed. </p>

We hope you find the benefits in packaging in trays interesting
to provide a classic marketing feature available only on high-level,
high-impact, food products. </p>
