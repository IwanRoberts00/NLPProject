<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#3:1>
ON MARCH 29, Black Saturday, Sotheby 's in Singapore auctioned off
some Philippine paintings.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#4:1>
A <mention> &ldquo; <indig> batis </indig> &ldquo; scene </mention> by
the late National Artist Fernando Amorsolo reportedly fetched the equivalent
of &peso;3.4 million.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#5:1>
Another 1950s Amorsolo, a <mention> &ldquo; <indig> Dalagang May Banga
</indig> ( Girl Holding A Cooking Pot), &rdquo; </mention> went for around
&peso;1.5 million.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#6:1>
A painting by a living artist, Ang Kiukok, went for &peso;.8 million,
perhaps the highest price ever paid for his work. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#7:1>
While the reports are still sketchy, it seems not all the
Philippine paintings were sold.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#8:1>
However, those sold fetched a fortune - - the <mention> &ldquo;
<indig> batis </indig> &ldquo; scene </mention> went for six times its
original &peso;.6 million.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#9:1>
One collector even pronounced the <mention> &ldquo; <indig> Dalagang
May Banga </indig> &ldquo; </mention> cheap at &peso;1.5 million, on top of
Sotheby 's commission.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#10:1>
The <mention> &ldquo; Ang Kiukok &rdquo; </mention> may have sold for
less than &peso;.25 million around five years ago. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#11:1>
This auction was already the third of Sotheby 's newest line:
Southeast Asian art.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#12:1>
The series groups the paintings of Indonesia, Thailand, the
Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and others in the region. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#13:1>
Most of the more expensive paintings in the first two auctions
were Philippine and Indonesian.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#14:1>
At the debut auction, a non-Filipino won over a local buyer after
bringing up the price to nearly a million for an <mention> Amorsolo
</mention> ( PDI Lifestyle ran a story on this last year).

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#15:1>
Of course it was too good to be true, and the transaction did not
push through.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#16:1>
But the results as a whole were encouraging enough for Philippine
artworks. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#17:1>
The second auction featured <mention> a Luna <foreign> boceto
</foreign> </mention> in his 1893 canvas, <mention> &ldquo; <foreign> Peuple
et Rois </foreign> ( People and Kings), &rdquo; </mention> for which there
were no takers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#18:1>
Nevertheless some Philippine paintings in that auction were sold for
respectable prices. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#19:1>
<h> <bold> New records </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#20:1>
In fact, Sotheby 's is a latecomer in the Philippine game.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#21:1>
Christies ' took the lead years ago, when its Hong Kong branch put on
the block Charles Wirgman 's original drawings, engravings of which were
published in the London Illustrated News.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#22:1>
Wirgman had traveled extensively before settling in Japan, where he
lived the rest of his life.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#23:1>
He sent back reports and illustrations to London, which were also
published by Harper 's in America. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#24:1>
Collectors and institutions interested in material on the Middle
East, South Asia and Japan all bid for his watercolors and drawings, since it
was logical to try to obtain the whole set.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#25:1>
A Filipino businessman outbid everyone else for those with Philippine
subjects, running up a bill of nearly &peso;30 million. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#26:1>
The prices fetched were considered so remarkable that the South
China Morning Post carried the auction on the front page the next day.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#27:1>
The next coup was again Christies ' .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#28:1>
A Belgian who inherited a folio of watercolors brought it for
evaluation to Sotheby 's, where an expert said it had little or no value.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#29:1>
A dealer working for Christies ' recognized them as Philippine, and
probably worth a lot of money, based on the results of the Hong Kong auction.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#30:1>
Research later showed that the folio of watercolors of typical
Filipinos in their usual style of dress, or <foreign> <it> album de trajes
</it> </foreign> , was by the 9th-century Manila artist Jose Lozano.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#31:1>
The set was sold to a Filipino for about &peso; 12 million. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#32:1>
Some months before, a private museum foundation bought a Lozano
sketchbook for &peso;5 million. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#33:1>
The London houses ' recent auctions have featured such diverse
Filipiniana as late 19th-century photographs; drawings by C. W. Andrews (
also published in 19th-century periodicals); maps of the Philippines and the
region; a set of Father Blanco 's <mention> &ldquo; <foreign> Flora de
Filipinas </foreign> . &rdquo; </mention> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#34:1>
<h> <it> Top prices </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#35:1>
For some years now, the San Francisco Auctioneers Butterfield and
Butterfield have been featuring Amorsolo paintings, some of which commanded
prices unheard of in the last decade, found by luck in flea markets abroad,
sold for nothing.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#36:1>
In the late 1960s, Teyet Pascual was able to buy Luna drawings for an
indecently small amount of <foreign> <it> pesetas </it> </foreign> ; BenCab
could comb London for maps and prints even on his then not-considerable
income.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#37:1>
In America there were <mention> Amorsolos </mention> to be had for
the price of a meal. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#38:1>
Of course, there were patricians like the late Don Eugenio Lopez,
who bought Filipino masterworks for his museum and foundation, paying good
money.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#39:1>
But Spain then was not one of the richer nations in Europe, and rich
Filipinos were rich. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#40:1>
The Marcos era was a dark period for Philippine art.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#41:1>
Good pieces were dumped by families fleeing persecution and economic
uncertainty.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#42:1>
Prices plunged from the 1970s, and recovered somewhat only from 1980,
when the Intramuros Administration and the Central Bank were buying. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#43:1>
A massive unloading occurred again after the Aquino slaying, when
unease drove upper-class Filipinos to emigrate.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#44:1>
Prices did not plunge, since the pieces being sold were top quality,
and sellers and buyers acknowledged that one was not compelled to sell, and
the other wanted to buy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#45:1>
The prices started climbing up again after 1986, but in fits and
starts.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#46:1>
Until well into the ' 90s increments were steady, but modest. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#47:1>
Today, the prices being quoted are awesome.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#48:1>
A bond paper-size <mention> Amorsolo </mention> for around half a
million.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#49:1>
A 24 x 36-inch one is cheap at &peso;1.5 million and may reach
&peso;4 million.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#50:1>
<mention> Manansalas </mention> are around the same price. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#51:1>
<h> <bold> Seller 's market </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#52:1>
The trade in <mention> &ldquo; vintage art &rdquo; </mention> - -
pieces by deceased masters and early works by living painters - - has been
quite lucrative over the last five years.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#53:1>
Pascual explained the logic of it once, in the darkest days after the
Aquino slay: first, the population of the Philippines was ever-increasing;
second, the economy would have to stop going downhill at some point, and then
start going up; third, as the economy improved, the rich would put part of
their wealth in art holdings; and fourth, the quantity of good Philippine art
was a constant, and this number would be depleted slowly by accidental damage
or destruction.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#54:1>
Therefore, he insisted, at some point the prices of Philippine art
would go up. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#55:1>
We have reached that point where there is more demand than
supply, and the prices have been going up dramatically.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#56:1>
There are hardly any master paintings available now in the country,
so they are being sought abroad. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#57:1>
The dream deal was that of art dealer Eva Florentino who some
years ago located the Andres Luna de San Pedro hoard of paintings in the US.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#58:1>
The paintings were bought for tens of millions of pesos by the Far
East Bank, which donated part of the collection to the National Museum. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#59:1>
A Filipino dealer has been locating paintings abroad by
advertising in newspapers and art publications ( such as <mention>
Connoisseur </mention> , <mention> Art at Auction </mention> ) in Spain,
England and America.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#60:1>
He has been cruising auction houses and casting his nets far and
wide.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#61:1>
He has become so successful that an American dealer in Honolulu and
another in California have tried to emulate him. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#62:1>
A Filipino diplomat in a European capital has been able to build
a personal collection by also dealing in paintings, sculptures and prints
found in the cities where he had been posted. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#63:1>
In the Philippines, art galleries have proliferated and new art
dealers have entered the market, like ants attracted to a picnic.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#64:1>
The <mention> Artwalk </mention> at Megamall in Mandaluyong has
emerged as the <mention> Mabini </mention> of the late 20th century,
showcasing Philippine art as commodity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#65:1>
A not-so-young ex <foreign> guru </foreign> left off his attempts
at establishing his own religion, in the belief that selling art would be
easier than convincing disbelievers that tithing is good for the soul. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#66:1>
Several women <foreign> <it> de buena familia </it> </foreign> ,
realizing that they have to work to eat, have decided that they would deal in
art, which would sound better than selling insurance or memorial plans. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#67:1>
<h> <bold> Art as commodity </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#68:1>
Three reasons may be cited for buying art.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#69:1>
First is its outright use - - that is, as artifact, which has use and
meaning.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#70:1>
Second, they are status symbols.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#71:1>
The third - - and the worse reason - - is that their prices are
expected to go up. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#72:1>
Stone Age men painting and scratching out figures and designs on
cave walls are no different from today 's businessmen seeking to enhance
their surroundings by buying and hanging art on their walls.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#73:1>
Art is full of meaning and is, first of all, a property of rituals.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#74:1>
Show me your paintings and I 'll tell you who you are.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#75:1>
For example there is a high probability of <foreign> <it> retokado
</it> </foreign> women, who are into ballroom dancing, having those stickily
pastel mother-and-child paintings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#76:1>
The kind of art you have around you speaks of your state of mind;
your past, present and future; the kind of friends you have; your income, and
therefore, your lifestyle. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#77:1>
While Filipinos are very individualistic, they are, nevertheless,
aware of status symbols.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#78:1>
Of course having a <mention> Lao Lianben </mention> is different from
having a <mention> Phyllis Zaballero </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#79:1>
<mention> Lao </mention> is monochromatic, subtle, profound.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#80:1>
But above all one sees the works of Lao hanging on the walls of the
country 's most successful young men and women.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#81:1>
A <mention> Lao </mention> , therefore, sets the owner apart,
indicates that he does business with or goes to the homes of the quietly rich
<it> intelligentsia </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#82:1>
That he is one of them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#83:1>
The worse reason for buying art is speculation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#84:1>
An artwork is often, but should not be treated, simply as a commodity
with future.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#85:1>
Buying a painting appears to be as uncomplicated as buying shares of
stock.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#86:1>
But the fact is that both transactions are not that simple.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#87:1>
If you don't know what you 're doing, don't do it. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#88:1>
<h> <bold> Knowing </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#89:1>
There are some keys points in buying art. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#90:1>
The first problem is that there are no published prices.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#91:1>
One expert evaluates paintings by the square inch which is
ridiculous.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#92:1>
Art cannot be treated like meat selling by the kilo.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#93:1>
Prices may be determined based on the most recent transactions, based
on <it> quality </it> not size. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#94:1>
The second problem is quality.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#95:1>
How does one know which painting is good, and which isn't?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#96:1>
In the case of works by artists who have passed away there is a third
dimension, authenticity.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#97:1>
How can one be sure that the signature is genuine? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#98:1>
This is where dealers and experts come in.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#99:1>
The most successful dealers actually aim not for the highest, but for
&ldquo; handshake &rdquo; prices.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#100:1>
These are prices where the seller is glad enough to let go, and the
buyer happy enough to pay. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#101:1>
Gallery owners usually try to maintain prices, not selling too
low, but not asking too high.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#102:1>
On this matter, the few experts who are not dealers cannot really
have much to say, since they cannot possibly keep track of transactions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#103:1>
The art dealer is expected to be an expert on quality as well as
authenticity.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#104:1>
The problem is that some buyers begrudge dealers their commissions
or profits, thinking they would get better deals buying directly from artists
or previous owners. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#105:1>
But that is not necessarily so.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#106:1>
Dealers have reputations to maintain, and try to make sure about
authenticity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#107:1>
Nevertheless, there are buyers who insist on having an
authentication document.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#108:1>
The Ayala Museum had such a service, although they had some problems
with the process, and decided to discontinue it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#109:1>
There are some individuals who used to issue documents, but
their signatures were associated with patently fake works. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#110:1>
Rod. Paras Perez 's Asean Art Institute does authentications,
sometimes running in contrast with the Authentication Panel of the National
Museum.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#111:1>
The latter institution constituted a three-member panel which meets
regularly to deliberate on artworks brought before it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#112:1>
As they say, where there 's arguing, there 's money.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#113:1>
With prices of art going up as they have, blood pressures are
expected to shoot up.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#114:1>
There are accusations and counter-accusations strewn with peso
signs, signs of ignorance, false assumptions, bruised egos and, here and
there, a few gems of insight. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#115:1>
<h> <bold> Collecting </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#116:1>
Only the young and the new collectors are alarmed.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#117:1>
The old hands chuckle, cajole, and even inflame those who are, at a
given moment, the principal characters in the drama of Manila 's art world.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#118:1>
The fact is that any one who collects art or even buys a single
painting must rely only on one person 's judgment: His own. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#119:1>
The same goes for antiques.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#120:1>
If you will buy an altar table, an ivory <foreign> <it> santo </it>
</foreign> , a cabinet or whatever, no one can tell you if you should buy it
or not. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#121:1>
The true art collector is a <foreign> connoisseur </foreign> , a
word which derives from the French <mention> <foreign> <it> connaitre </it>
</foreign> </mention> and the Latin <mention> <foreign> <it> cognoscere </it>
</foreign> </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#122:1>
Taste proceeds only from knowledge.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#123:1>
The connoisseur <bold> knows </bold> , and above all <bold> lives
</bold> with art. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#124:1>
How does one become a <foreign> connoisseur </foreign> ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#125:1>
First, one must be educated, not necessarily in school, but from
books and knowledgeable people. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#126:1>
Second, one must move in the right circle.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#127:1>
This means knowing the right collectors, dealers, experts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#128:1>
And third, one must be self-motivated.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#129:1>
You must like art and live it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#130:1>
Art and antiques are part of a lifestyle.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#131:1>
If you have pre-Hispanic gold jewelry, they 're real, just as your
diamonds are.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#132:1>
If you have sterling silver service and flatware, that means you
have the servants to clean them.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#133:1>
If you have old <indig> <it> kamagong </it> </indig> chairs, your
dining table can't be made of plywood.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#134:1>
If you have an Albor, you have friends who won't think the house
painter botched up your wall.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#135:1>
If you have a Luna, you know it really is one, no matter if some
expert thinks it 's not. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#136:1>
Above all, if you want to buy a piece of art, you 'll buy it,
even if there are those who say it 's too expensive and you can't sell it
except at a loss this afternoon.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#137:1>
You know it 's good, it 's real, you want it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#138:1>
And you can afford it.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-005#139:1>
So there. </p> </I>
