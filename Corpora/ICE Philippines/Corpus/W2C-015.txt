<h> <bold> Banks to cut lending rates </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#2:1>
<h> <bold> Move to go with mopping up of dollars </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#3:1>
<bold> Manuel Sanchez and Dona Policar </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#4:1>
<indig> BANGKO Sentral ng Pilipinas </indig> ( BSP) Governor
Gabriel Singson said yesterday private bankers have agreed to bring down
lending rates to 17% or 18% to prevent further slide of the peso. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#5:1>
BSP officials believe the move by the Bankers Association of the
Philippines ( BAP), which groups foreign and local banks, would complement
earlier policies to mop up excess dollars in the market. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#6:1>
Singson said there will be another one percentage point reduction
in liquidity reserves required of banks, scheduled to take effect Oct. 15.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#7:1>
This will mean that some &peso;0.5 billion more money will enter the
system, Singson said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#8:1>
Meanwhile, University of the Philippines professor Benjamin Diokno
supported the view of Singson that the strength of the Philippine peso is
dependent on interest rates. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#9:1>
<quote> &ldquo; For as long as the interest rate does not return
to its normal level, we cannot really see the true value of the Philippine
peso. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#10:1>
Diokno attributed the rebound of the peso last week to the
recovery of other currencies in the region. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#11:1>
The recovery of their regional currencies, like the Thai
<foreign> baht </foreign> and the Indonesian <foreign> rupiah </foreign> ,
was due to their enrolment with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF)
program, he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#12:1>
<quote> &ldquo; In other words, from a sharp depreciation, their
currencies now are beginning to manifest strength due to the assistance from
the IMF program.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#13:1>
This would mean biting the bullet and imposing discipline under the
IMF supervision, &rdquo; </quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#14:1>
The Philippines was scheduled to get out of IMF supervision in
June 30 this year.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#15:1>
But the plan was postponed because Congress was unable to pass the
tax reform bill, an IMF condition. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#16:1>
Diokno said that once the country is able to get out of IMF
supervision, it should be able to maintain the confidence of foreign and
local businessmen. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#17:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Even if we exit from the IMF tutelage, it doesn't
mean we will not have any program - - financial or economic, &rdquo; </quote>
Singson said.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#18:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Only this time we will have more say in designing
that program to replace what we have under the IMF, &rdquo; </quote> he
added. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#19:1>
IMF Managing director Michael Camdessus has told Singson during
the Hong Kong conference that tax reform bill should be passed as soon as
possible to generate more revenue and to lessen the impact of the peso
depreciation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#20:1>
Camdessus said other than the tax bill, the Philippines has
already complied with all the requirements by the IMF for the Philippines to
get out of the IMF program. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> House to start probe on FM gold </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#23:2>
IN LINE with the suggestion of President Ramos, the House of
Representatives will start today its investigation into the reported Marcos
gold bullions reportedly stashed away in Swiss banks. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#24:2>
The House committee on good government has invited to the
hearings national security adviser Jose T. Almonte, former Presidential
Committee on Good Government chairman Jovito Salonga, Makati Congressman
Joker Arroyo, former Solicitor General Sedfrey Ordo&ntilde;ez and businessman
Michael de Guzman. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#25:2>
The House had investigated the Marcos wealth during the time of
former President Corazon Aquino, but the committee decided to call another
investigation because of new revelations about the wealth. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#26:2>
Human rights lawyer Robert Swift revealed two weeks ago that the
name of the Philippine president appeared in a certificate of deposit
intended to withdraw the Marcos gold hoard. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#27:2>
<quote> &ldquo; This issue on the Marcos gold, we feel that it is
a matter of national, public interest.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#28:2>
That being the case, we feel in the committee that we should look
into this case, &rdquo; </quote> said Quirino Rep. Junie Cua, chairman of the
committee on good government. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#29:2>
Cua said the probe will be different from the investigation
undertaken in the Eighth Congress by the Special Committee on Public
Accountability, then headed by Misamis Oriental Rep. Victorico Chavez. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#30:2>
<quote> &ldquo; The investigation that will be conducted is
different from the earlier probe since the former dealt with the Marcos Swiss
accounts.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#31:2>
We will now zero in on the alleged sale of Marcos gold, &rdquo;
</quote> Cua said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#32:2>
Meanwhile, the President revealed yesterday the results of the
investigation conducted by the Presidential Commission on Good Government (
PCGG) on the allegations by its former agent, Reiner Jacobi, that the
Philippine government had participated in the laundering of the alleged
Marcos gold deposits in Switzerland. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#33:2>
The inquiry showed that the claims of Jacobi are false and its
documents fake, PCGG Chairman Magtanggol Gunigundo reported to President
Ramos in a confidential memorandum which the President made public yesterday.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#34:2>
The President directed Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Renato
Cayetano to review the PCGG report, entitled <mention> &ldquo; The Jacobi
Claim, &rdquo; </mention> in coordination with Gunigundo, in light of the
government 's plan to sue human rights lawyer Robert Swift for maligning Mr.
Ramos ' reputation by accusing him of having a Swiss bank account. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#35:2>
Swift got his story from Jacobi. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#36:2>
The President directed Cayetano to give him a feedback on the
matter not later than Oct. 18, 1997. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#37:2>
The highlight of the PCGG report was the existence of two Dr.
Ritters in the alleged Marcos gold hoard memorandum: the fake and the real
one. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#38:2>
Gunigundo also said the banner headline of the October 1 issue of
a newspaper <mention> &ldquo; Marcos Gold Deal--Swiss Witness Tags FVR, Then
Retracts, &rdquo; </mention> was <quote> &ldquo; misleading and erroneous.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#39:2>
He informed the President that <quote> &ldquo; retraction
presupposes that the real Dr. P. Ritter-Jurus executed or issued the internal
memorandum ( on the Marcos gold), when in truth and in fact, said memo was
executed by a fake Dr. Ritter. &rdquo; </quote> </p> </I>

<bold> Rey Requejo </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#42:3>
FOR THE 31st time since 1992, President Ramos will again embark
today on a series of foreign trips amid calls from some quarters for him to
suspend such visits due to some pressing problems plaguing the country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#43:3>
This time he will make official visits to Hong Kong, Myanmar and
Laos with the mission of reinvigorating the Philippines ' diplomatic,
economic and political relations with them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#44:3>
The President will depart for Hong Kong at 8 a.m. today and is
expected to arrive at the Kaitak Airport there at 10 a.m. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#45:3>
Topping his agenda are the request to Hong Kong authorities for
the extradition of suspected drug godfather Alfredo Tiongco and offering some
help and advice to the two newest members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations ( Asean) on how they can compete with the fast-growing
economies in the Asia Pacific. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#46:3>
Describing his visit as <quote> &ldquo; very timely, &rdquo;
</quote> the President pointed out that relations with those countries are
critical.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#47:3>
Hong Kong has just been turned over to the Chinese government by the
United Kingdom in July, while Myanmar and Laos are still on the adjustment
stage with the regional grouping. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#48:3>
The President will be at the former British Crown Colony from
Oct. 13 to 15; Myanmar, Oct. 15-17; and Laos, Oct. 17-18. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#49:3>
The President will be accompanied throughout his trip by First
Lady Amelita Ramos, Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon Jr.,
Presidential Adviser for Foreign Affairs Apolinario Lozada Jr. and Press
Secretary Hector Villanueva. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#50:3>
Trade Secretary Cesar Bautista and Finance Secretary Roberto de
Ocampo will join the presidential party in Hong Kong, while Justice Secretary
Teofisto Guingona will form part of the official delegation to Hong Kong and
Laos. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#51:3>
Health Secretary Carmencita Reodica, Environment and Natural
Resources Secretary Victor Ramos and Education Secretary Ricardo Gloria will
be part of the President 's official party in Laos and Myanmar. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#52:3>
Members of Congress who will join the President are Sen. Roberto
Romulo, and Congressmen Manuel Roxas III, Eriberto Loreto, Alfredo Abueg and
Eduardo Rama Sr. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#53:3>
There will be 48 members of the business delegation, 25 of whom
will be going to Hong Kong, 35 to Myanmar and 30 to Laos. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#54:3>
In Hong Kong, Mr. Ramos will deliver a keynote address at the
Sixth World Economic Forum Business Conference for the Asia Pacific to be
held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre tomorrow, Oct. 14.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#55:3>
Mr. Ramos said he will use the opportunity to reassure the
business community that the Philippine economy remains in <quote> &ldquo;
good shape, &rdquo; </quote> despite the speculative attacks on Southeast
Asian currencies, including the peso. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#56:3>
For his part, Budget Secretary Salvador Enriquez said the
President undertakes this trip at an opportune time for Asean and his
leadership owing to the persistent regional currency crisis that has slowed
down the economic growth in the region. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#57:3>
Mr. Ramos, according to Enriquez, should use this opportunity of
addressing the world economic and business leaders to send two distinct
messages: that the Asean economies will bounce back from their bout, and that
the Philippines remains sound and stable. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#58:3>
The economic conference in Hong Kong will be attended by some 600
top business leaders from Europe and the Asia Pacific. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#59:3>
<quote> &ldquo; We have to prove our case in the face of all
these storms going through Southeast Asia, including the haze and the &ldquo;
smaze &rdquo; ( smoke and haze) affecting our region, &rdquo; </quote> the
President said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#60:3>
The President will also personally seek the assistance of Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region ( HK-SAR) Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa
for the return of Tiongco to the Philippines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#61:3>
<quote> &ldquo; My visit to Hong Kong... is to pursue our request
for the extradition of Alfredo Tiongco, already in the control of the Hong
Kong authorities, who was charged here under Philippine laws and must be
turned over to the Philippine courts. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#62:3>
Aside from Tiongco, the President will also get the assurance of
the SAR government over the continued protection of some 150,000 overseas
Filipino workers ( OFWs) in Hong Kong. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#63:3>
On the other hand, Mr. Ramos ' state visits to Myanmar and Laos
are principally to welcome them as the newest members of the ASEAN.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#64:3>
The Philippines is the chairman of the Standing Committee of the
Asean. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#65:3>
He will consult with the leaders of the two countries on how the
Philippines can help them in pursuing the requirements under the Asean Free
Trade Area ( AFTA), which is covered by the Common Effective Preferential
Tariff ( CEPT) as well as enhance development cooperation and technology
transfer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#66:3>
The President is expected to sign six bilateral agreements with
the ruling military junta of Myanmar and five others in Laos. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#67:3>
He will be back to the Philippines on the afternoon of Oct. 18
via Subic International Airport in Zambales <quote> &ldquo; to dramatize for
the Asia Pacific and the world that the Philippines has many attractive
destinations. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#68:3>
Meanwhile, Sen. Edgardo Angara branded the international road
show to be launched by the government in Hong Kong intended to attract
foreign investors as an <foreign> inutile </foreign> exercise as he dismissed
Mr. Ramos ' scheduled foreign trips as a callous display of indifference to
the plight of the poor people reeling from the currency crisis. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#69:3>
Angara urged the President instead to cancel his trips, saying,
<quote> &ldquo; It 's just a waste of taxpayers ' money. &rdquo; </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#70:3>
He said: <quote> &ldquo; No amount of drum beating abroad can
restore investors ' confidence in the country 's fitness as a safe investment
haven in Asia, unless the government adopts the necessary measure to overhaul
the weak economic fundamentals that have made the peso highly vulnerable to
the speculative attacks and dismantle the high interest regime. &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#71:3>
Angara added: <quote> &ldquo; It is sad to note that we have a
President who continues to travel abroad as if anything is coming up roses in
his country.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#72:3>
That, for me, is the height of callousness. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

SPEAKER Jose de Venecia yesterday said the House of
Representatives will investigate the alleged &peso;25-million lobby fund for
the passage of the controversial bill reviving <foreign> jai alai </foreign> .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#77:4>
<quote> &ldquo; It has to be checked, it has to be investigated,
&rdquo; </quote> de Venecia said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#78:4>
House bill 8358 was approved on second reading Thursday, granting
Metropolitan Leisure and Tourism Corp. a legislative franchise to construct,
operate and maintain <foreign> jai alai </foreign> frontons in the country.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#79:4>
De Venecia said he never voted for the bill. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#80:4>
Some congressmen questioned the way the bill was approved, since
Thursday is normally reserved for local bills and there was no quorum when it
was passed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#81:4>
Congressmen Emigdio Bondoc ( Pampanga), chairman of the committee
on ethics, said his panel will look into the alleged lobby fund once a
resolution is filed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#82:4>
Congressman Roilo Golez ( Para&ntilde;aque), chairman of the
committee on public order and security, said he voted against the measure
since <foreign> jai alai </foreign> is another form of gambling. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#83:4>
Golez urged congressmen who knew about the supposed fund to come
out in the open. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#84:4>
At least five committees which handled the bill reportedly
received money from the lobby. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#85:4>
Golez said that if <foreign> jai alai </foreign> is approved, it
will compete with the government 's on-line lottery or lotto. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#86:4>
He also warned that once Congress passes the measure, it will
resuscitate <indig> masiao </indig> , another form of illegal gambling. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#87:4>
At the same time, Rep. Edcel Lagman ( Albay) yesterday formally
filed House resolution 1397, directing the ethics and good government
committees to conduct an inquiry into the reported lobby fund. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#88:4>
<quote> &ldquo; This <foreign> expos&eacute; </foreign> on the
&peso;25-million lobby fund, albeit not validated, tends to destroy the
integrity and credibility of the House and renders all of its 218 members as
suspects and recipients of the alleged payola, &rdquo; </quote> Lagman said.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#89:4>
Lagman noted that Belle Corp., joint owner of the Metropolitan
Leisure and Tourism Corp., branded the allegations as totally false. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#90:4>
<quote> &ldquo; It is critical immediacy that a thorough
investigation of this serious accusation be conducted in order to validate or
disprove such accusation, &rdquo; </quote> he added. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-015#91:4>
Lagman said it is imperative that innocent parties are spared the
general indictment of complicity, while errant parties, if ever there are, be
meted corresponding sanctions. </p> </I>
