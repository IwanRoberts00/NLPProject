Dear Mrs. Juplo:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#9:1>
Through the courtesy of Ms. Dinah Rose Ayeng, a teacher and
friend, I have known that your school needs an English teacher in the
Elementary Department.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#10:1>
I would like to apply for this position. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#11:1>
In college my academic standing had been very favorable.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#12:1>
I had been in the Dean 's List for the past four semesters.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#13:1>
I also became a member of the College Club, a Vice-Governor of the
College Council, and eventually a College Editor of the La Salle Yearbook '
97.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#14:1>
Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Arts in Teaching English
Language in order to become competent in my own field of specialization and
to become abreast of the recent trends in language education. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#15:1>
For two years I have experienced the challenge of teaching at St.
John 's Institute, where I have been teaching Language Five and Intermediate
Speech.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#16:1>
To be a good teacher, one not only needs a solid command of the
subject matter, but also proper classroom management and discipline to be
able to teach effectively.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#17:1>
Thus, I am confident that I know what I will be facing as a teacher
and that I have the skills to be creative and dynamic. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#18:1>
The accompanying <foreign> resume </foreign> will give you
details of my qualifications, including a list of persons to whom you may ask
or write for more information about me.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#19:1>
If you consider my application, I shall be happy to come to your
office for an interview any time at your convenience.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#20:1>
You can reach me through telephone no. 495-2920 c/o Ms. Neneng Caile.
</p>

I would like to apply for a part-time teaching job in the college

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#32:2>
My four-year teaching experience in elementary from the private
schools has been an invaluable period of learning and growth.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#33:2>
However, I believe the time has come for me to move on to a higher
level that can give me the opportunity to continue my professional
development in the pursuit of higher studies.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#34:2>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#48:3>
Dear Sir/Madam:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#49:3>
The undersigned is applying for financial assistance in the
Graduate School for a Master of Arts in Teaching English Language ( MATEL)
starting the first trimester of school year 2001-2002. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#50:3>
My desire to pursue higher studies has prompted me to go to
Manila in search of better opportunities that will equip me with the
necessary skills and prepare me for a more challenging and fulfilling job in
the end.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#51:3>
Although I have earned some graduate units in the University of St.
La Salle, Bacolod City, during the time I had been teaching in elementary, I
believe that it will take me several years to finish my M. A. degree.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#52:3>
More so, my salary ( being the head) was not enough to support my
family and my studies at the same time.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#53:3>
Thus, when I knew that DLSU-Manila is offering a scholarship grant, I
never hesitated to inquire about the program.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#54:3>
I then pondered on the possibility of resigning from teaching, and
finally submitted my resignation effective last March 31, 2001.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#55:3>
Now that I have gained insights and experiences, I am ready to take
the risk and sacrifice to achieve my ambition: to finish my M. A. at the
soonest time possible and eventually go back to teaching in college. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#56:3>
I believe that La Salle has always been generous to deserving
students who are in their peak of aiming their goals high.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#57:3>
Thank you very much. </p>

Our group in Psycholinguistic class was assigned to report on the
learning styles of graduate students in the university.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#71:4>
In this connection, we are going to conduct a 5-minute survey on
Saturday, November 3, 2001 using the two groups of English classes, either
8-11a. m. or 12-3 p. m.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#72:4>
The result of the survey will be treated with utmost confidentiality
and only for the purpose of the said study.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#73:4>
Should you grant us permission, we will be glad to start working our
group project at the soonest time possible. </p>

Dear Mrs. Kikuchi:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#89:5>
Greetings in St. La Salle! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#90:5>
During the first trimester of school year 2001-2002, I applied
for a scholarship grant for a Master of Arts in Teaching English Language,
and eventually enjoyed a 55% tuition fee discount.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#91:5>
I was supposed to renew it for the next term, however, I was given
another opportunity to work as a research assistant of Dr. Bautista, Director
of Graduate Studies and Head Proponent of the International Corpus of
English-Philippine based, a major research project whose aim is to collect
samples of Philippine English.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#92:5>
Thus, for the past two terms, I also enjoyed a free tuition fee and a
generous stipend from the research grant.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#93:5>
However, Dr. Bautista informed me that my research work will end on
May 15, so right after that I will not be able to avail of the same
opportunities that I have had as a graduate assistant to continue my studies
for the next term. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#94:5>
I would like, therefore, to renew my scholarship grant for the
first trimester of school year 2002-2003.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#95:5>
My academic standing, during the last three terms, will give you
proof of my ability to cope with and sustain the rigorous demands of graduate
studies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#96:5>
I hope I can avail of the scholarship grant for this coming
school year.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#97:5>
Thank you very much for your kind attention to this request. </p>

Dear Dr. Bautista:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#166:9>
Another milestone in my pursuit of continuing professional
development occurred when I came to Manila last year.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#167:9>
I applied for a ( STUFAP) scholarship grant and eventually enjoyed a
55% discount for my tuition and miscellaneous fees.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#168:9>
With the untiring support of my sister and few good friends, I am
looking forward to finishing my Master 's degree at De La Salle University
soon. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#169:9>
Looking back on the past year, I could not help but be grateful
to the many learning opportunities along my way.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#170:9>
Though I have gone through financial and emotional difficulties in
the course of my study, I remain steadfast in aiming my goal.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#171:9>
Fortunately, I was given the opportunity to work with you as a
research assistant, thus making me proud not only that I enjoyed a 100% grant
and a generous stipend to aid my graduate studies, but also I have had a
firsthand experience in research with the first-rate sociolinguist of the
country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#172:9>
Now that I have only one term prior to finishing my degree, I
would like to mention if it would be possible for me to join in the October
graduation after completing and passing all the necessary requirements before
the deadline set by the registrar 's office.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#173:9>
My problem, however, is that I still have one remaining course,
Curriculum and Materials Preparation, which I have to take while at the same
time preparing for the written and oral comprehensive examinations.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#174:9>
I believe that as a graduate student, it is my utmost duty and
responsibility to abide by the rules and regulations stipulated in the
graduate students ' handbook.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#175:9>
I believe, though, that it would be both practical and economical on
my part to finish my degree at the soonest time possible after going through
my course schedule and the dates for the first trimester.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#176:9>
Considering my priorities in life, both my teaching career and my
family, is something I want to focus on after my studies.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#177:9>
Thus, I would like to work first right after graduation in order to
support my mother and my two nieces back home. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#178:9>
I hope for your kind attention to this matter.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-023#179:9>
Thank you very much.

God bless you. </p>
