<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#7:1:B>
Are you sure that you never saw a copy of this report

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#8:1:C>
Already answered Your Honor

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#9:1:A>
Just for the record what was the answer of the witness
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#10:1:A>
<{> <[> Am I </[> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#11:1:C>
<[> The witness said </[> </{> before Your Honor that he has not uh actually seen this uh document because it was followed by an injunction from the court in Pasig

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#12:1:A>
Now the documents are brought before him
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#13:1:A>
It is up for him to answer

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#14:1:B>
<{> <[> Well I wish counsel wouldn't </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#15:1:A>
<[> So the objection is overruled </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#16:1:B>
I wish I counsel wouldn't answer for the witness

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#17:1:A>
Just go ahead please

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#18:1:C>
I am not answering for the witness
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#19:1:C>
I 'm just saying that he has answered it earlier Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#20:1:B>
<{> <[> No but that was before not now </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#21:1:A>
<[> There was a ruling already </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#22:1:A>
There is no need for you to debate on that issue

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#23:1:D>
Your Honor this is the report that was submitted by the Compliance and Surveillance Group to the S E C which was handed to my office through my secretary
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#24:1:D>
And when I was informed about it this is the report that I referred immediately to the Prosecution and Enforcement Department but I never had a chance to go over and read this report Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#25:1:B>
But you saw the report

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#26:1:D>
I I saw the well this page Your Honor I I see I remember very distinctly

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#27:1:B>
All right <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#28:1:B>
Now this page as I read to you has a date February eleven two thousand
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#29:1:B>
Now my question is that <,> previously <,> I recalled to you that <,> the Securities and Exchange Commission <,> was brought back to the supervision of the Department of Finance per Executive Order one nine two on January seven two thousand
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#30:1:B>
My question is that isn't it a fact that when this report Exhibit seven M 's was brought to your office on February on or about February eleven two thousand that <.> exec </.> that Order was already in effect in the sense that the S E C had already been brought back to the supervision of the Department of Finance no longer under the Office of the President
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#31:1:B>
Is that is that correct

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#32:1:D>
Uh that is correct Your Honor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#33:1:D>
Now I recall uh I remember that just before uh I was suspended uh the Securities and Exchange Commission was then also under and and I 'm referring to the first preventive suspension was then under the Department of Finance but uh this was uh brought back to the Office of the President and then in January of the year two thousand this was brought back to the uh Department of Finance
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#34:1:D>
That is your that is correct Your Honor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#35:1:D>
So in January of two thousand for your question we were already under the Department of Finance

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#36:1:B>
And at the time the report was brought to your office you were already back under the Department of Finance because this was on February eleven two thousand couple of weeks after the Executive Order

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#37:1:D>
While this report was is dated February eleven two thousand it was actually received by my office in the afternoon about five o 'clock of February twelve two thousand Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#38:1:B>
And at that time the Securities and Exchange Commission had already been brought back to the supervision of the Department of Finance

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#39:1:D>
That is correct Your Honor if you say that the Executive Order and I have no doubt to I have no reason to doubt you it was issued on January of the year two thousand

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#40:1:B>
To whom did you refer the report Exhibit seven M 's after it was brought to your office on February twelve two thousand

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#41:1:D>
I referred this to the head of the Prosecution and Enforcement Department which at that time was in the person of Atty Ruben Ladia

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#42:1:B>
From the time that <.> ref </.> you referred Exhibit seven M 's to Atty Ladia until <,> your resignation took effect on March twenty-six of that year did you have any occasion to discuss the report with him

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#43:1:D>
No Your Honor I never had the occasion to discuss this report <{> <[> with </[> Atty Ladia

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#44:1:B>
<[> Did you </[> </{> not take the initiative to inquire from Atty Ladia on what he did with the report considering that during at least about six weeks after you got the report the report was with him

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#45:1:D>
No Your Honor because at that time the Commission <foreign> en banc </foreign> uh had required Atty Ladia to regularly make a report on its investigation of this B W transaction on a weekly basis every time that we met in our regular meetings of the Commission <foreign> en banc </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#46:1:D>
So I I I had not even uh discussed this report or followed it up or taken the initiative as you mentioned with respect to this matter as regards Atty Ladia Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#47:1:B>
Did you not previously testify that <O> cough </O> his department the P E D as you called it was one and the only one department that worked under your supervision and that you directly had authority and supervision over the P E D
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#48:1:B>
Did you testify to that effect

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#49:1:D>
I testified uh Your Honor to the effect that at that time I was the supervising commissioner of the Prosecution and Enforcement Department 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#50:1:D>
But because under the law the Commission <foreign> en banc </foreign> also has supervision over uh uh the the departments of the S E C on the basis of the exercise of its supervision every department not only the P E D were required to submit weekly reports to the S E C Commission <foreign> en banc </foreign> every time that the Commission <foreign> en banc </foreign> met with respect to their area of responsibilities Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#51:1:B>
As supervising commissioner did you not think it did you not consider it fit to have a copy of that report or copy of the weekly reports furnished you by Atty Ladia

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#52:1:D>
No Your Honor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#53:1:D>
On the contrary I felt that I should not really be dictating upon what the uh uh P E D should be doing with respect to uh this report because they know uh what they are supposed to do
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#54:1:D>
The rules and regulations and procedure of the S E C is very explicit on the matter

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#55:1:B>
No I was not asking you as to whether you dictated or influenced the P E D
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#56:1:B>
My only question Chairman is whether as supervising commissioner you asked a copy of the weekly reports that P E D was supposed to make to the Commission <foreign> en banc </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#57:1:B>
Did you ask for a copy

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#58:1:D>
Oh yes Your Honor we were furnished copies of the weekly reports of the S E of the P E D with respect to their investigation on B W shares but it was not uh uh a copy of reports based on this
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#59:1:D>
It was a copy of reports of the progress on the status of their investigation on their own on the B W matter Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#60:1:B>
During during your direct testimony if I recall correctly <O> cough </O> you said that the Philippine Stock Exchange as all exchanges under P D nine oh two A falls under the jurisdiction of the SEC 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#61:1:B>
Did I <,> recall correctly

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#62:1:D>
Yes Your Honor under the uh Revised Securities Act which was the law then enforced the S E C regulated the entire securities market including the players in that market which also included all of the exchanges Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#63:1:B>
And the P S E <,> has had jurisdiction over the member brokers of the Exchange is that correct

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#64:1:D>
The uh I I it 's not quite correct to end that way Your Honor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#65:1:D>
What I am saying is that uh the Philippine Stock Exchange was given the authority by the S E C to have a first crack at investigating and policing and disciplining their own membership uh before the S E C takes over in the light of the new regulatory method that we put in place which is evolving that Exchange into a self-regulatory organization Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#66:1:B>
Now when you said <mention> first crack </mention> what you mean is that uh before S E C would investigate P S E must first investigate

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#67:1:D>
Only with respect to irregularities in the securities market involving stock brokers and dealers under their membership organization Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#68:1:B>
Because uh P S E has no jurisdiction or authority over individual investors

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#69:1:D>
That is correct Your Honor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#70:1:D>
But they have also limited jurisdiction over companies whose shares are listed in that exchange and they also have jurisdiction over them as well

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#71:1:B>
Companies

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#72:1:D>
Companies whose shares are listed yes

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#73:1:B>
But not individual investors

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#74:1:D>
No no

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#75:1:B>
During your tenure as uh Securities and Exchange Commission uh Associate Commissioner and later and especially when you were Chairman of the Commission the reputation you had was that uh you were open and transparent
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#76:1:B>
Was that uh reputation uh justified in your estimate

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#77:1:D>
I I 'm not aware of the reputation Your Honor but uh what I 'm aware of is is that it was under my term as Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission that I enforced another set of regulatory method which is precisely to make the securities market efficient transparent and fair
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#78:1:D>
And on that basis we made it the policy of the Commission to always require full disclosure with respect to matters that would be important to investors Your Honor so that they could make an intelligent decision on whether or not to invest in a particular stock

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#79:1:B>
Related to that policy of uh transparency was your availability to media to being interviewed to being invited to uh press interviews 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#80:1:B>
Wasn't that isn't that correct

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#81:1:D>
That is correct although I recall Your Honor that at some instances the media had also criticized me for for clamping on certain information

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#82:1:B>
Do you recall that on January nineteen two thousand you were in the premises of the Philippine Stock Exchange

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#83:1:D>
Yes Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#84:1:B>
Why

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#85:1:D>
I was there in the premises of the Philippine Stock Exchange on January of <.> ni </.> of the year two thousand uh because at that time in the afternoon about two o 'clock the Senate Committee on Banks and Financial Institutions held one of their hearings in that premises uh in connection with its investigation of the B W transactions Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#86:1:B>
The Committee on Banks Financial Institutions and Currencies uh at that time was chaired by Senator Raul Roco wasn't isn't it

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#87:1:D>
That is correct Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#88:1:B>
As far as you can remember besides Senator Roco was there any other senator belonging to that Committee who was present at that hearing as you called it

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#89:1:D>
There was no other senator at that time except Senator Roco Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#90:1:B>
Mr Chief Justice conformably to precedent uh in this court <,> and I believe I 've mentioned this earlier I would like to invoke judicial notice of the fact that a hearing was conducted by the Committee on Banks or a number of hearings was conducted by the Committee on Banks Financial Institutions and Currencies in regard to the B W shares
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#91:1:B>
And one of the hearings was as said by the witness on January nineteen two thousand at the uh P S E offices uh in Pasig City
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#92:1:B>
I would also ask that judicial notice be taken of the transcript or transcripts transcript or transcripts of the hearings before that Committee specifically that of January nineteen two thousand
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#93:1:B>
In relation to that uh Mr Chief Justice <,> we have pre-marked as uh as <O> cough </O> <,,> as Exhibit sixty-two for the defense a copy of that transcript and would request the distinguished prosecutors to consider stipulating as to this transcript marked Exhibit sixty-two sixty-two A sixty-two B sixty-two C and sixty-two D
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#94:1:B>
I 'm informed that copies have been provided the members of the Court as well as the prosecutor

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#95:1:A>
Sixty-two

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#96:1:B>
Would the prosecutor agree to this particular exhibit in regard to existence execution and due authenticity

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#97:1:C>
Oh yes Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#98:1:B>

<ICE-PHI:S1B-064#99:1:B>
