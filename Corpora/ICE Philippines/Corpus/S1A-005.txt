 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#3:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#4:1:B>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#5:1:B>

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#6:1:A>
<[> Uh uhm </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#7:1:B>
I finished my high school in Assumption
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#8:1:B>
Actually <,> pre-school <,> well I started out in Holy Spirit and then we moved to Saint Theresa 's
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#9:1:B>
I finished my high school in <{> <[> Assumption </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#10:1:A>
<[> Assumption </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#11:1:B>
And I went to U P for college took up Business Administration

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#12:1:A>
Uh-huh
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#13:1:A>
And then I took my masters M B A in Louvaine a Catholic university in Belgium

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#14:1:A>
Uh in Belgium

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#15:1:B>
Yeah and I finished it in eighty-one

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#16:1:A>
And now you 're working with <{> <[> Union Bank </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#17:1:B>
<[> I work with </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#18:1:B>
No <,> uh well actually <,> it 's an affiliate of Union Bank
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#19:1:B>
It 's called U B C Capital Corporation it 's an investment house

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#21:1:A>
And you 've been with them for how many years

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#22:1:B>
Well I started out working at the Union Bank since nineteen eighty-eight

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#23:1:A>
Up to <{> <[> your <unclear> word </unclear> </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#24:1:B>
<[> Up to now </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#25:1:B>
The the we left the investment house for we were the investment bank division in the bank and we formed the investment house
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#26:1:B>
We left the investment bank to join the investment house
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#27:1:B>
So practically speaking we built that on the purpose of <unclear> word </unclear> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#28:1:A>
Okay <,> so I 'll be starting on <,> your life before you became a public figure

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#29:1:B>
Are you saying when I was much younger

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#30:1:A>
Yeah <,> if you could say if you can recall <O> laughter </O> anything that you can remember <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#31:1:B>
So those <{> <[> things </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#32:1:A>
<[> How </[> </{> how that was or how you spent your days
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#33:1:A>
What you did

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#34:1:B>
All I remember when we were kids <,> when we were 'cause we started out actually in in nineteen sixty-three was his political <.> caree </.> career started out when he was appointed
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#35:1:B>
I think it was in nineteen sixty-two <,> when he was appointed as Secretary of Justice

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#36:1:A>
By whom

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#37:1:B>
By <,> President Macapagal
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#38:1:B>
But before that <,> he was just a lawyer <indig> 'no </indig> an ordinary lawyer
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#39:1:B>
And what I remember of about him was just that he was at work and he would always be home at night
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#40:1:B>
And weekends is what I remember is that we 'll always be together
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#41:1:B>
Every Sunday we would have to go to Mass and then after Mass <,> we would go <,> sometimes we would eat lunch or out
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#42:1:B>
Sometimes we 'd be at home
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#43:1:B>
And after lunch or on he would take pictures
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#44:1:B>
That was his hobby

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#45:1:A>
<{> <[> Taking pictures </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#46:1:B>
<[> Uh we </[> </{> we used to live there in the Boulevard
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#47:1:B>
So we would walk across along the bay and then we would take a <,> pose for him <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#48:1:B>
He 'd take pictures that that was the normal routine
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#49:1:B>
That much I remember but I <.> no </.> I guess you 'll have to ask me more <,> more questions <indig> na lang </indig> <,> or when we get to the <,> generally it was the fact that he was around when we wanted him
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#50:1:B>
He was more like uh <,,> he was I would say he was really a family man <,> 'cause he was always with us

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#51:1:A>
Uh-huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#52:1:B>
But I don't know <,> uhm how <,> politically involved he was then
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#53:1:B>
I was much too young <,> <{> <[> because </[> actually he <,> was appointed Secretary of Justice I was only about ten years old

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#54:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#55:1:B>
So I wouldn't <{> <[> really know </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#56:1:A>
<[> You wouldn't be able to remember </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#57:1:B>
No <,> I wouldn't remember much <,> except <indig> 'no </indig> the usual kid stuff

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#58:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#59:1:B>
But I do remember the Sundays that we would spend uh taking pictures walking in the Boulevard
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#60:1:B>
And there used to be <indig> bancas </indig> along the Boulevard
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#61:1:B>
<{> <[> And now <,> not anymore </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#62:1:A>
<[> Back then </[> </{> <O> laughter </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#63:1:B>
Back then <,> and <,> sometimes we would ask the fisherman who owned the boat if we could use the <indig> banca </indig> to take pictures of us <,> inside the <indig> banca </indig> or whatever
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#64:1:B>
We would not be on the water just along the <{> <[> <,> </[> along the bay because it was quite okay to walk through there walking around there like that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#67:1:B>
That much I remember about those Sundays

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#65:1:A>
<[> Uh </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#68:1:A>
So he was really more a homebody stay at home

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#69:1:B>
Yeah <,> <{> <[> we didn't have </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#70:1:A>
<[> And his office </[> </{> was here <indig> ano </indig> here

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#71:1:B>
No

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#72:1:A>
No

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#73:1:B>
At that time <,> when we were growing <,> uh his office only moved to the house after Martial Law

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#74:1:A>
Uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#75:1:B>
Because before Martial Law his office was in <,> M H Del Pilar <,> the building of <indig> Lola </indig> Long
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#76:1:B>
<{> <[> There was a building </[> <,> there that I think Daddy used

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#77:1:A>
<[> Uh I see </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#78:1:B>
I don't know what how <,> how it came about that <,> Daddy had his office there
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#79:1:B>
That office has about three or four floors with the lawyers
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#80:1:B>
And when Martial Law came and Dad was picked up uhm <,> well of course the office had to be closed because Daddy really didn't know how long he was gonna be <{> <[> inside </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#81:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#82:1:B>
So <,> then we moved all the books <,> all his books <{> <[> uh to </[> the house
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#85:1:B>
Then <,> the office was moved to the house <,> <unclear> 3 words </unclear> of the building <indig> na rin </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#83:1:A>
<[> Uh uhm </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#86:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#87:1:B>
From that time on that was the time <{> <[> when the office </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#88:1:A>
<[> You used to </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#89:1:B>
Before <,> that <,> his office I remember going to Regina Building
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#91:1:B>
That much I remember near the Church his office is along Escolta Regina Building <,> that much I remember
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#94:1:B>
And we would go there and pick him up that time <{> <[> from the office </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#95:1:A>
<[> Oh really yeah </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#96:1:B>
We 'd go there pick him up then he 'd take us out
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#97:1:B>
Sometimes we 'd go to the movies at night <,> along Escolta
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#98:1:B>
You know that 's really weird
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#99:1:B>
That much I remember about him

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#100:1:A>
Uh-huh but what particular hobbies <,> did he have <,> you know things photography for one you mentioned

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#101:1:B>
Photography for one definitely because sometimes he would he would call us to help him in the dark room
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#102:1:B>
He had a dark room in the <{> <[> house </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#103:1:A>
<[> Uh </[> </{> how nice

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#104:1:B>
And he would make us go in just to mix the chemicals for him or help him
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#105:1:B>
He never really made us do all the hard stuff <,> just to be just to be there
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#106:1:B>
He 'd ask you okay you mix this for me you watch this <,> you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#107:1:B>
Things like that <,> but that 's what he would do
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#108:1:B>
Photography is really the thing that I remember
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#109:1:B>
He loved to fiddle with his cameras
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#110:1:B>
He was so excited every time he 'd go find a new lens <,> or a new what
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#111:1:B>
He 's excited also when he 's printing his own pictures you know <{> <[> the ones that </[> he would take
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#113:1:B>
That I remember

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#112:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#114:1:A>
What about <{> <[> <,> </[> reading writing

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#115:1:B>
<[> Reading </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#117:1:A>
Do you have any literary <,> <{> <[> things </[> he did or was it mostly essays

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#118:1:B>
<[> That </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#119:1:B>
Well no
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#120:1:B>
They don't <unclear> 1 word </unclear> it also when he was inside

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#121:1:A>
Uh I heard he wrote he wrote you poems <{> <[> <indig> 'no </indig> </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#122:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#123:1:A>
I remember

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#124:1:B>
Because I told you he would write us letters 'cause when he was under detention that was the time when we well we we had to <unclear> 1 word </unclear> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#125:1:B>
First we were allowed to visit him every day
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#126:1:B>
Then the military said no
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#127:1:B>
It had to be <indig> mga </indig> once a week <indig> lang </indig> or twice a week
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#128:1:B>
In <.> othe </.> they would use it as <.> psych </.> psycho war you know like <,> just to break you or to make you feel as a like it was some kind of mental torture
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#129:1:B>
Because suddenly you go there for a visit and then they would say no visits allowed today 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#130:1:B>
You 're there already all set to fix his meal

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#131:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#132:1:B>
And then you 'd bring food because that was what we would always do bring food and whatever
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#133:1:B>
And then they would say no and and no reason they wouldn't give you any reason <,> why you couldn't visit
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#134:1:B>
Come back tomorrow or come back and when you come back the next day and there would still be no visits
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#135:1:B>
Things like that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#136:1:B>
So <,> what Dad would do was he would write us letters uhm especially on dates like your birthday Christmas uh or if if there was some kind of problems we were having that <{> <[> time that </[> Mom would tell him about then he 'd write a letter

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#137:1:A>
<[> Uh uhm </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#138:1:B>
I remember graduation from college he wrote me a letter
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#139:1:B>
But this this would be censored because the military would pass <,> <{> <[> would pass </[> through them

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#140:1:A>
<[> Really </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#141:1:B>
The only time I remember that that they really cut up
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#142:1:B>
I think we still have it somewhere the military cut up <,> some words you know <,> <.> lit </.> literally censoring it <indig> 'no </indig> the letter was during that time I think it was before or after <,> he was in solitary

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#143:1:A>
Now how long how long was that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#144:1:B>
Well that was the time they went to they moved them to Nueva Ecija <{> <[> for one month </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#145:1:A>
<[> So they did </[> </{> change
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#146:1:A>
They did change <{> <[> location </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#147:1:B>
<[> They moved them </[> </{> for about one month
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#148:1:B>
And then we couldn't visit for about that during that time
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#149:1:B>
And they wouldn't tell us where Daddy was

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#150:1:A>
Did they did they change him in any way
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#151:1:A>
Did they do you you recall any specific change in his personality <,> after his detention or even during his detention when you would go visit him <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#152:1:A>
<{> <[> How was he </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#153:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#154:1:A>
Was he the same

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#155:1:B>
Same I think
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#156:1:B>
Uh if anything I think it made him a more human person

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#157:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#158:1:B>
Because uhm I think that was when his <,> his <,> thoughts on human rights began to crystallize

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#159:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#160:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear> when that 's when he that 's why when he got out when he was he when he was released that was the time that he started uh all of his human rights work and going around the country and talking and defending these people
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#162:1:B>
That was when it really started
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#163:1:B>
But he was always the type who was looking for the family for support
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#164:1:B>
And since we knew that he had done nothing illegal to deserve being put in jail except he was just a very vocal critic of Marcos at that time then we were not afraid
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#166:1:B>
Well of <,> no I don't think we were afraid and we were supportive of him and there were people who would come to us and say oh just tell him to do what Marcos wants and you know everything 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#167:1:B>
But why he has not done anything wrong so Dad has always been a very principled person so this is he was the one who taught us all he <unclear> word </unclear> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#168:1:B>
If there 's anything wrong since you haven't done anything wrong and you believe that what you 're doing is correct why should you you know

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#169:1:A>
Just do what you want

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#170:1:B>
Just to do just to do what somebody else wants
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#171:1:B>
So that was what he lived by
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#172:1:B>
Actually the last I think the last uh let 's say the last uh twenty years I think because he died in eighty-seven <indig> 'no </indig> <{> <[> <,> </[> and he was imprisoned in seventy-two so he was released in seventy-four
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#175:1:B>
So <indig> mga </indig> the last thirteen to fifteen years of his life was really devoted to human rights <,> ever since prison because in fact what happened was in prison he could do everything what he couldn't do before that because he was a Senator you know he had to do a lot of things like the Senate work

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#173:1:A>
<[> Uh uhm </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#177:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#178:1:B>
And then he had his law office and then you know speaking engagements and all that stuff
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-005#179:1:B>
