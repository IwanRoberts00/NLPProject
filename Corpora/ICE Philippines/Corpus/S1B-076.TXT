<I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#1:1:A>
So Nadia
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#2:1:A>
Nadia basically this is uh just an informal interview because the
Lasallian Ambassador group is a big group composed of about sixty plus or
about seventy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#3:1:A>
So in based on my uhm three years experience being the Coordinator
for the Ambassadors <{> <[> <,> </[> uhm what happens is they just come and
go and sometimes I really don't get to know them personally
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#4:1:A>
I only get to know uhm about a handful of them about <indig> siguro
 </indig> uh about half half of the Ambassador group personally for the whole
year before they leave
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#5:1:A>
So what I want to do is uh have better relationship with them
quality relationship with them therefore I 'm meeting you uh all personally
one by one
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#6:1:A>
Okay so uhm before we go on with several of my questions could you
please introduce yourself to me a little background

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#7:1:B>
<[> <?> God </?> </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#8:1:B>
Uhm well I 'm Nadia Tolentino Duque
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#9:1:B>
Uh right now I 'm a first year B S A student
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#10:1:B>
Uh I actually come come from Liberal Arts so it 's C L A then I
shifted to Accounting

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#11:1:A>
Uh-uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#12:1:B>
So my previous course was <indig> ano </indig> Communication
Arts Business Management <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#13:1:B>
Then you know with all the requirements for shifting and all of
that I was so glad <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> that I was able to pass <{3> <[3> <,> 
 </[3> and while I was doing the process for shifting I was also applying for
Lasallian Ambassadors that time <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#14:1:B>
So I was so glad

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#15:1:A>
<[1> <indig> Oo </indig> </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#16:1:A>
<[2> Uh-uhm </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#17:1:A>
<[3> Uh-huh </[3> </{3> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#18:1:A>
<[4> Uh-huh </[4> </{4> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#19:1:A>
<O> laughs </O> So many paper work <indig> ha </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#20:1:B>
Yeah so many paper work then there was the midterms <{1> <[1> 
 <,> </[1> those stuff and everything <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#21:1:B>
I was glad that first I learned the results from the shifting <{3> 
 <[3> <,> </[3> that I was able to shift

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#22:1:A>
<[1> Uh-uhm </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#23:1:A>
<[2> Uh-uhm </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#24:1:A>
<[3> Uh-uhm </[3> </{3> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#25:1:B>
Like we were only four shiftees from uh external shiftees to
Accounting then only three of us made it to shift <{> <[> <,> </[> to the
course

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#26:1:A>
<[> Uh-uhm </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#27:1:A>
Uh-uhm
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#28:1:A>
Why why why did you want to shift

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#29:1:B>
It 's my interest
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#30:1:B>
It 's like during the L-Pep during the L-Pep I was asking the
Lasallian Ambassador uh how how do you do shifting <{> <[> <,> </[> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#31:1:B>
That 's what that 's that that was my first question because

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#32:1:A>
<[> Uh-huh </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#33:1:A>
Was that was that your first choice your first choice

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#34:1:B>
Yeah it was my first choice but then La Salle wasn't my first
choice then for a school

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#35:1:A>
Ahh I see
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#36:1:A>
What was your first choice

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#37:1:B>
It was U P

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#38:1:A>
U P
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#39:1:A>
What happened at U P <O> laughs </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#40:1:B>
Like everyone so I didn't get in I didn't <O> laughs </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#41:1:A>
Okay okay

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#42:1:B>
Chances are if I passed I 'd probably get <unclear> 1 word
 </unclear> <?> Floating </?> Technology there or something so I 'm glad I
didn't
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#43:1:B>
And right now I 'm here in La Salle with Ambassadors and everything

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#44:1:A>
Uh-uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#45:1:B>
So then what happened next was that I I was then I shift I was
able to shift and then I learned the results from the internet <{1> <[1> <,> 
 </[1> that I passed then that 's it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#46:1:B>
Right now I 'm an irreg <&> = irregular </&> student <{2> <[2> <,> 
 </[2> I get to meet different people
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#47:1:B>
Then I 'm glad that I 'm with the Ambassadors because once in a
while I could say <mention> hi </mention> to people and <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> 
say <mention> hi hello </mention> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#48:1:A>
<[1> Uh-uhm </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#49:1:A>
<[2> Uh-uhm </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#50:1:A>
<[3> Uh-uhm </[3> </{3> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#51:1:A>
What are your other involvements in school other organizations

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#52:1:B>
Uh actually I also joined J PIA
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#53:1:B>
So I was the only Communication Arts student who was

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#54:1:A>
In J PIA <O> laughs </O>

<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#55:1:B>
In J PIA <O> laughs </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#56:1:B>
I really wanted Accounting so during the we had this <{> <[> <,> 
 </[> General Assembly

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#57:1:A>
<[> Uh-huh </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#58:1:A>
Assembly

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#59:1:B>

yourself so <mention> hello </mention> I 'm <indig> ganyan ganyan </indig> B
S A I 'm like this B S A
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#60:1:B>

 <,> </[> so <indig> parang </indig> uh okay so that 's it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#61:1:B>
So I 'm glad I 'm B S A also so I could mingle with them so

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#62:1:A>
<[> <O> laughs </O> </[> </{> So you 're you 're just a plain
member in J PIA

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#63:1:B>
Yeah plain member <indig> din </indig> for <indig> Tapat
 </indig> but I 'm inactive

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#64:1:A>
Inactive
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#65:1:A>
Why did you join <indig> Tapat </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#66:1:B>
Uh principles I guess
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#67:1:B>
I don't know it 's like it 's

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#68:1:A>
Do you find yourself uh further involved in <indig> Tapat
 </indig> 's activities

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#69:1:B>
Hopefully but then I don't know where to start <{1> <[1> <,> 
 </[1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#70:1:B>
Like right now I my priorities are more in school with the
requirements <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and everything

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#71:1:A>
<[1> Uh-uhm </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#72:1:A>
<[2> Uh-uhm </[2> </{2> <&> Secretary interrupts </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#73:1:A>
Just let her wait

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#74:1:B>
So that 's it I guess <O> laughs </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#75:1:A>
What activities would you like to be involved in <indig> Tapat
 </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#76:1:B>
<indig> Tapat </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#77:1:A>
Uh-uhm what what found the what did you find interesting in
 <indig> Tapat </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#78:1:B>
It 's their view of being quite leaning on the left side

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#79:1:A>
Uh-uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#80:1:B>
I don't know I think they have this thing and then during the
NEAT activity they <{> <[> <,> </[> also made this presentation which there
were points given that I quite agree on it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#81:1:A>
<[> Uh-uhm </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#82:1:A>
Uh-uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#83:1:B>
Like <.> stude </.> student things like that and <{> <[> <,> 
 </[> then and sometimes I guess maybe in second year and the third

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#84:1:A>
<[> Uh-uhm </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#85:1:A>
Uh-uhm and what was your reason for joining the Ambassador group

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#86:1:B>
The reason why I joined actually for it 's just that I wanted
to do something and during my stay in La Salle the fact that I was I was
already here <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#87:1:B>
Then I saw the uhm application dates then actually I wasn't able to
pass during the regular time it 's like <,> they extended <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> 
that was the time I was able to pass it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#88:1:B>
Actually I didn't I didn't quite expect <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> to make
it with all the difficult <[4> <{4> interviews </[4> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#89:1:B>
You know I mean I was so glad that I was able but the reason why I
joined because I like to meet people <{5> <[5> <,> </[5> I like to meet uh
like <indig> ano </indig> other students and then what I like what I wrote in
my essay I said that I like to give back what I learned or what I experienced
during my L <.> Pe </.> L-Pep which was

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#90:1:A>
<[1> Uh-uhm </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#91:1:A>
<[2> Uh-huh </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#92:1:A>
<[3> Uh-huh </[3> </{3> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#93:1:A>
<[4> Requirements </[4> </{4> <O> laughs </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#94:1:A>
<[5> Uh-huh </[5> </{5> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#95:1:A>
Why what did you experience <O> laughs </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#96:1:B>
It was nice because I got the chance to bond with other people
 <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> and then there was then I saw the Lasallian Ambassadors
like fun people because during the last part isn't it there 's a culminating
activity for all the Ambassadors
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#97:1:B>
They were like dancing <indig> paikot </indig> <O> laughs </O> <{2> 
 <[2> <,> </[2> so <indig> parang </indig> wow <indig> galing tapos parang
 </indig> you get to be a teacher for two days <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#98:1:B>
So be the big guy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#99:1:B>
I don't know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#100:1:B>
That 's why I wanted to join

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#101:1:A>
<[1> Uh-uhm </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#102:1:A>
<[2> Uh-uhm </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#103:1:A>
<[3> Uh-uhm </[3> </{3> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#104:1:A>
Do you think you 'd be good in teaching

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#105:1:B>
No <{> <[> <O> laughs </O> </[> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#106:1:B>
I have a phobia phobia for <indig> ano </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#107:1:A>
<[> No </[> </{> <O> laughs </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#108:1:A>
Phobia for what

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#109:1:B>
Because I 'm a student myself and I know like for example <?> 
Mina Barok </?> there 's this teacher who 's from Visayas who who has an
accent
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#110:1:B>
So chances are people would mimic it <indig> parang ganon </indig> 
will try to <{> <[> <,> </[> <indig> ano </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#111:1:B>
Basically it 's the student relation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#112:1:B>
I don't know if I could <indig> ano </indig> manage it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#113:1:A>
<[> Uh-uhm uh-uhm </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#114:1:A>
But that 's part of the requirement for bring an Ambassador <{> 
 <[> to have the facility </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#115:1:B>
<[> Yeah yeah I know </[> </{> that 's what I want to get
over in I mean to learn to learn the

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#116:1:A>
Uh-uhm
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#117:1:A>
And then what else what else are you looking for in an
organization
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#118:1:A>
Probably one of the reasons why you chose the Ambassador group

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#119:1:B>
Something that 's active that that does something <{1> <[1> 
 <,> </1> unlike for you know for some professional orgs <&> = organizations
 </&> like there you give you just pay the <indig> ano </indig> for being <{2> 
 <[2> <,> a membership </[2> fee
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#120:1:B>
You have this party then that 's it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#121:1:B>
For the whole year that 's the activity

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#122:1:A>
<[1> Uh-huh </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#123:1:A>
<[2> Membership fee </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#124:1:A>
Uh-uhm uh-uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#125:1:B>
Unlike here you get to go to the S P S then you have your own
 <indig> tambayan </indig> those I <{> <[> <,> </[> guess would that 's nice
 <indig> ano </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#126:1:A>
<[> Uh-uhm </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#127:1:A>
How how do you find the Ambassador group so far

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#128:1:B>
Fun we keep on laughing <{> <[> <O> laughs </O> </[> then
although

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#129:1:A>
<[> Fun uh-huh </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#130:1:A>
Have you been with us during our past activities <{> <[> the
 <indig> salu-salo </indig> </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#131:1:B>
<[> Yeah <unclear> words </unclear> </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#132:1:A>
Have you attended some of the campus tours orientation

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#133:1:B>
Uh there was a campus tour yesterday <{> <[> <,> </[> but my
first class was one o'clock so I just

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#134:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#135:1:A>
<&> missing words </&> the Catanduanes group didn't you you
weren't able to join that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#136:1:B>
What 's that

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#137:1:A>
We also had a campus tour for a group of students <{> <[> <,> 
 </[> from the State College in Catanduanes

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#138:1:B>
<[> Uh I was </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#139:1:B>
Uh no

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#140:1:A>
Not yet
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#141:1:A>
So this is the first activity that you were able to join was the
 <indig> salu-salo sa <unclear> 2 words </unclear> </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#142:1:B>
Yeah then the <{> <[> <,> </[> turn-over

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#143:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{> and the turn-over
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#144:1:A>
So aside from them being fun

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#145:1:B>
They 're <indig> ano </indig> confident <{> <[> <,> </[> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#146:1:B>
Imagine to handle all those people

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#147:1:A>
<[> They 're confident </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#148:1:A>
People who you don't know

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#149:1:B>
Yeah and then it 's only you it 's only you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#150:1:B>
Then those stuff <indig> parang </indig> it <.> tak </.> takes a
lot of guts
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#151:1:B>
I mean <indig> parang </indig> the Ambassadors itself it 's hard
with all the interviews the things you have to do and then you have to act
you have to do this
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#152:1:B>
I remember there was this question during the interview <mention> 
 <indig> Ba't bilog ang </indig> manhole </mention> <{> <[> <,> </[> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#153:1:B>
<indig> Parang </indig> they asked me that <O> chuckles </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#154:1:B>
<indig> Ha </indig> I don't know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#155:1:B>
And then there was also another question like <mention> How come
the sheep in Baa Baa Black Sheep is <indig> ano </indig> black </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#156:1:B>
<indig> Parang bakit </indig> black <indig> ang </indig> sheep
 <indig> sa </indig> <mention> Baa Baa Black Sheep </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#157:1:B>
<indig> Parang kasi </indig> it 's for kids so kids usually use uh
 <indig> ano </indig> same letters <&> sings </&> <mention> Baa Baa Black
Sheep </mention> so it 's supposed to be all letter B
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#158:1:B>
Or they make all sorts of suggestions what if there was never a
lamb <indig> parang </indig> there was there was never a sheep throughout
history what would be the animal like

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#159:1:A>
<[> Parang </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#160:1:A>
You know the reason for that what was the reason for asking those
questions

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#161:1:B>
No

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#162:1:A>
They just wanted <indig> ano </indig> get you a <?> card </?> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#163:1:A>
And then they asked that in between several serious questions <{> 
 <[> right </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#164:1:B>
Right <[> so </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#165:1:A>
So they they were just trying you on whether you

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#166:1:B>
And I kept <{> <[> on answering </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#167:1:A>
<[> You kept on answering </[> </{> <O> laughs </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#168:1:B>
The first thing that comes to my mind I answer it because it 's
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#169:1:B>
But they also made me shout in on the top of a chair <mention> 
Screaming Darna </mention> pretending that there was fire

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#170:1:A>
How how did you find the screening

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#171:1:B>
It was hard
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#172:1:B>
Before the screening I was actually planning to not take it
anymore <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> because I 've I 've heard from the other people
who 've done it <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> their their term was <indig> katay
 </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#173:1:A>
<[1> Uh-huh </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#174:1:A>
<[2> Uh-huh </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#175:1:A>
What

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#176:1:B>
<indig> Katay </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#177:1:A>
<indig> Katay </indig> what do you mean by <mention> <indig> 
katay </indig> </mention> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#178:1:B>
<indig> Parang </indig> you have to go through <indig> 
talagang </indig> super <indig> hirap </indig> <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> because
for other for other I think organizations just like ones the ones the
Ambassadors is like one of the hardest <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> I don't know for
for them

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#179:1:A>
<[1> <indig> Oo oo </indig> </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#180:1:A>
<[2> Uh I see </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#181:1:A>
Because we want to get the best <{> <[> <O> laughs </O> </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#182:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> of course

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#183:1:A>
<indig> Oo </indig> we only get the best and the most
confident
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#184:1:A>
Because if you don't have the basic skills to start off with <{1> 
 <[1> <,> </[1> we 'll be having <{2> <[2> a </[2> difficult time <{3> <[3> 
training you </[3> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#185:1:B>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#186:1:B>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#187:1:B>
<[3> Training them </[3> </{3> <indig> di ba </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#188:1:A>
Yes at least we have to have the basics the foregrounder
which we could work on

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#189:1:B>
Like what what are

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#190:1:A>
Like we we we would like to have people at least a certain
level of confidence already <{1> <[1> because </[1> if from the very start
they 're already <{2> <[2> shy </[2> we 'll be having a difficult time
training them
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#191:1:A>
We only have a short time to train them before L-Pep <{3> <[3> <,> 
 </[3> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#192:1:A>
Well actually on the way uh you 'll be more enhanced in terms of
uh being confident and having the skills <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#193:1:A>
But we want to have at least something to work on <{4> <[4> <,> 
 </[4> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#194:1:A>
So with the people we have right now at least we 're confident
that we got uh that well the cream of the crop <O> laughs </O> the best <{5> 
 <[5> <,> </[5> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#195:1:A>
So you 're one of the best all right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#196:1:A>
Uh we see that all of you have potential uh <{6> <[6> <,> </[6> 
 <.> how </.> however uh we would like to make you better
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#197:1:A>
So therefore we 'll be requiring you to attend all the trainings
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#198:1:A>
Right now you 've been accepted as an Ambassador <{7> <[7> <,> 
 </[7> however you have to earn the title <{8> <[8> <,> </[8> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#199:1:A>
You have to earn the title of being an Ambassador for completing
all the requirements meaning the trainings the meetings because uhm in our
experience there have been several students who applied <{9> <[9> and then
 </[9> but after that they weren't able to attend several <{10> <[10> <,> 
 </[10> training sessions
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#200:1:A>
Which is unfair because some of them uhm well almost all of them
went through with all the training sessions
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#201:1:A>
And I think it 's very important that for you to be able to be a
good Ambassador you 'll have to have the skills and to be knowledgeable of
whatever things that we 're supposed to do

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#202:1:B>
<[1> Uh which are </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#203:1:B>
<[2> Shy </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#204:1:B>
<[3> Yeah </[3> </{3> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#205:1:B>
<[4> Uh-huh </[4> </{4> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#206:1:B>
<[5> Uh for the </[5> </{5> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#207:1:B>
<[6> Thank you </[6> </{6> that 's nice
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#208:1:B>
<[7> Thank you </[7> </{7> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#209:1:B>
<[8> So </[8> </{8> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#210:1:B>
<[9> But then </[9> </{9> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#211:1:B>
<[10> Trainings </[10> </{10> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#212:1:B>
Uh so what 's the training all about

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#213:1:A>
Uh it 's all about the skills that you have to give for being
an Ambassador <{> <[> how to be diplomatic </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#214:1:B>
Ahh <[> <?> game setting </?> </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#215:1:A>
Uh aside from that how to be diplomatic how to facilitate <,> 
effective presentation skills <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> how to be more confident
what is the proper way of dealing with guests uh the do 's and don'ts of being
with guests <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> uhm what else
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#216:1:A>
Events management is also part of it because I also delegate
projects to Ambassadors for them to handle
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#217:1:A>
And then I what I do is just supervise because this is a
preparation for uhm what do you call this your profession
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#218:1:A>
After you graduate <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> you 'll be asked to handle
projects
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#219:1:A>
You 'll be asked to uh talk in front of people you 'll be asked to
uh what do you call this speak in front of a big group
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#220:1:A>
So I think that 's what uh we value in terms of skill more on
public relations
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#221:1:A>
So we hope we could what do you call this we could create more
confident public relations people for the University uhm with the Ambassadors

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#222:1:B>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#223:1:B>
<[2> Uh yeah </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#224:1:B>
<[3> Uh <unclear> words </[3> </{3> </unclear> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#225:1:B>
<indig> Pero </indig> it 's nice that we 're called Ambassadors
 <{> <[> <,> </[> compared to before Orientors

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#226:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#227:1:A>
Orientors because the Orientors only just work for L-Pep <{> <[> 
during </[> the freshmen during the freshman orientation

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#228:1:B>
<[> For L-Pep </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#229:1:B>
<indig> Pero </indig> it 's tedious during before the L-Pep

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-076#230:1:A>
Yes <O> chuckles </O> it 's tedious before and during L-Pep
and a little after probably especially for the Logistics group </I>
