<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#46:2:A>
Good morning
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#47:2:A>
Here now is the nine o'clock business news round-up 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#48:2:A>
In the headlines this year 's economic growth may be constrained by severe power situations in Mindanao and Luzon
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#49:2:A>
Meanwhile the Department of Finance is planning a twenty-five billion peso bond float to provide increased earnings for Central Bank
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#50:2:A>
In news abroad Vietnam and Malaysia agree to jointly develop disputed islands instead of quarrelling over them
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#51:2:A>
Those are the headlines now the business news in detail
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#52:2:A>
This year 's economic growth may be constrained by the drastic cutback in power supply in Mindanao and the prospect of more power outages in the Luzon grid due to breakdowns in NAPOCOR 's aging power-generating plants
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#53:2:A>
This based on a study on power outages done by a medium-sized commercial bank
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#54:2:A>
As such the study terms the power situation as one of the most serious problems of the Philippine economy and one which needs government 's immediate attention
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#55:2:A>
Accordingly the unanticipated and frequent brownouts <,> in Luzon could allow only a two point six percent growth in G N P by nineteen ninety-two <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#56:2:A>
On the other hand according to a NAPOCOR official Mindanao 's power situation will be more stable by the middle of nineteen ninety-three as the build transfer and operate contract for the two hundred ten megawatt diesel power plant between Mitsui Corporation and NAPOCOR is expected to be signed before the end of the month
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#57:2:A>
The first barge is expected to be finished within seventeen months while the second barge will be on line after two to three months
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#58:2:A>
Financing for the two hundred thirty dollars to two hundred fifty million dollars project will come from the Japan EX-IM Bank and a Spanish loan
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#59:2:A>
The source said that once the contract is signed the Mitsui Corporation composed of a Danish and Spanish firm can start work on the project <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#60:2:A>
In a related news Agriculture Secretary Senen Bacani says that the agricultural sector will not be heavily burdened by the power shortage in Mindanao compared to other sectors in the economy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#61:2:A>
His statement however lies in contrast with the grievances aired by private sector leaders who warned that agribusiness enterprises will be severely crippled considering their heavy dependence on electricity for water supply
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#62:2:A>
Earlier reports also reveal that farmers in agribusiness companies leave their crops to rot and fishermen selling their produce at dirty cheap prices due to lack of refrigeration facilities
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#63:2:A>
Meanwhile the current situation in Mindanao will have a worst effect on the poultry sector according to Odi Ogalino Director of the Department of Agriculture 's Marketing Assistance Service
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#64:2:A>
He explains that since the incubation process is heavily dependent on electricity the frequent brownouts will disrupt incubation periods for hatching eggs
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#65:2:A>
Mindanao 's chicken population is at five point six million comprising fourteen point eighty-six percent of the country 's total chicken supply <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#66:2:A>
In other news the Department of Finance is planning a twenty-five billion peso bond float designed to provide the Central Bank two point five billion pesos in interest earnings
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#67:2:A>

<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#68:2:A>

The L R T one capacity expansion project and the construction of L R T two have been integrated and are proposed to be funded under the eighteenth <foreign> yen </foreign> O E C F loan package
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#71:2:A>
Earlier the National Economic and Development Authority headed by President Aquino approved the L R T one and L R T two projects for completion by nineteen ninety-six
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#72:2:A>
The L R T one project involves the acquisition of thirty-two operationally <.> ka </.> compatible light rail vehicles depot expansion and some station roof expansion while the L R T two project involves the construction of a new L R T line running from the Doroteo Jose station in Santa Cruz Manila to Katipunan Avenue in Quezon City

On the other hand there is a shortage of cement in Bacolod City and consumers expect an increase in prices beginning next month
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#83:2:A>
This is due to the high cost of production brought about by the power shortage in southern Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#84:2:A>
It was reported that traders in Iloilo City are once again storing stocks of cement in anticipation of price increases within this month
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#85:2:A>

<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#86:2:A>

<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#89:2:A>

<ICE-PHI:S2B-014#93:2:A>
