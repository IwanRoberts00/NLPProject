<ICE-HK:S2B-033#1:1:A>
I won't bask in the <,> <.> re </.> reflected glory of the
Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#2:1:A>
I wasn't in the cast

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#3:1:A>
I wasn't even an extra

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#4:1:A>
I was with the audience

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#5:1:A>
The film is the work of the best in Chinese cinema coming from Hong
Kong Taiwan and the Mainland

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#6:1:A>
I won't even talk about the political implication <,> of the
Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon because there  ' s none

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#7:1:A>
What I will do though is talk about the movie and its impact on
movie-making in Hollywood and this part of the world

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#8:1:A>
Tiger and Dragon is a martial art film with the emphasis on art
rather than martial bit

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#9:1:A>
Western audience are impressed by it because it wasn't one of those
kungfu flicks that reduce the plot to a sideshow for the special effects

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#10:1:A>
That the whole film is in Mandarin rather than dubbed English
making it extra exotic or authentic to some people

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#11:1:A>
Actors speak Brooklyn English do stunts won't be half as convincing

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#12:1:A>
That a day a report proposed that more Hong Kong Chinese films
should be done in English to capture the western audience

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#13:1:A>
I disagree because that Tiger and Dragon has proven how western
viewer want Chinese film that are authentic who can blame them

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#14:1:A>
The audience are become more sophisticated and our film have to
serve up <,> and not down to them

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#15:1:A>
When I first watched the Tiger and Dragon I don't think it would go
down well with the Hollywood since I grown up watching Shaw studio action
epics in which people fly through the air flit from roof to roof and punch
hole through brick walls

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#16:1:A>
But western audience were apparently awed because they <,> weren't
so jaded and because they rarely watch action movie presented with such
elegance

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#17:1:A>
Thirty years ago Hong Kong made many such films even though not a
such grand scale

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#18:1:A>
But lately our filmmaker has been shunting the genre open instead
to borrow routine western themes and shot them in Hong Kong setting

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#19:1:A>
The result that people were worried

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#20:1:A>
Most want to watch Hollywood story told with the Hong Kong
backdrops

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#21:1:A>
Movies are supposed to be an adventure <unc> 1 WORD </unc>
romantic magical escape from everyday existence rather than rehash of the
daily grind

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#22:1:A>
We go film to get away and to be charmed

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#23:1:A>
Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is essentially a studio sort of
production done with twenty-first century filming techniques

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#24:1:A>
That make the film so engrossing that is harks back to more
innocent time when <.> mo </.> movie were fun memorable and subtle

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#25:1:A>
Westerners said to me Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a fable with
moral plus an action film which fight scenes are beautiful choreographed

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#26:1:A>
They  ' re right <,> they  ' re also tired the present generation of
Hollywood action movies that look and feel more <,> like cartoons

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#27:1:A>
People can only put up with so many car flipping over flames houses
blowing up and human cartoon getting decapitated and disemboweled

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#28:1:A>
They forgot all those movie with steroid pumped action hero but
they will never forget John Wayne and John Ford westerns and Jimmy Stewart  ' s
battle with his anxiety before he joined battle with the fastest gun in the
west

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#29:1:A>
In recent years Hollywood has lured away the best from Hong Kong
cinemas

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#30:1:A>
Our homegrown action directors has redefined the genre

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#31:1:A>
They have introduced the shots from multi-angles and with
multi-cameras

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#32:1:A>
John Woo is an example

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#33:1:A>
He succeed in turning John Cruise into action hero ballerina in
Mission Impossible Two and made John Travolta look fantastically cool and yet
evil in the Missing Arrow

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#34:1:A>
Jackie Chan our homegrown fun action hero is paying back to the
community by shooting the sequel to Rush Hour in the street of Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#35:1:A>
Ang Lee has added another element to action film

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#36:1:A>
He actually begin as a director of dramas such as English costume
variety in Sense and Sensibility and which won him an Oscar nomination

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#37:1:A>
Lee in Tiger and Dragon refused to compromise as he directed the
uniquely Chinese collaboration entirely on the mainland on the relatively
tight budget and in a language which in the novel and script were written

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#38:1:A>
His was a artistic gamble and since western audience I think
American in particular up to then seldom respond well to foreign films

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#39:1:A>
The subtitle are just too distracting

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#40:1:A>
For Tiger and Dragon they made the exception because nothing could
distract from the beauty of the story the beauty of the cinematography the
beauty of the scenery and of course the beauty of the actors

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#41:1:A>
They will continue to see similar films in foreign language if
those were exceptionally crafted

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#42:1:A>
I suspect from now on Hollywood will be influenced by Tiger and <.>
Dra </.> Dragon and proceed to do more action movie with rich in plots and
minus most of the scenes of violence

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#43:1:A>
If my inkling is right then perhaps the more and more action film
won't need to be slapped with the X rating and could return to family
entertainment once more again like westerns are loved in my youth as much as
the Shaw Studio movies

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#44:1:A>
Some film review gushed about the commercial and artistic success
of the Tiger and Dragon as a sign of Chinese cinema coming of age

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#45:1:A>
This assessment is rather <,> stretched

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#46:1:A>
Chinese cinema has long been a powerful media when it  ' s done with
class

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#47:1:A>
We can say the same about Hollywood about the French about the
British about the German about the Italian

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#48:1:A>
I think when movies are a blending of the art and entertainment
they  ' re unsurpassed as a visual experience whatever the country of the of
origin

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#49:1:A>
I myself find the chauvinism <?> having stretched </?> national
symbol to movie as disturbing as in sports

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#50:1:A>
We don't want to carry grudges and bear with flags when we go into
a theater or stadium

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#51:1:A>
Some baggage we can leave behind

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#52:1:A>
We  ' re moving towards a world without frontiers in filmmaking as in
sports as in the global economy

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#53:1:A>
Actors of different nationality appear in the same movies merely
adjusting their accent to suit the script

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#54:1:A>
I salute Sir Michael Caine and Sir Anthony Hopkins <,> <.> vers
</.> versatile actors

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#55:1:A>
I  ' m seeing the evidence of that in Hong Kong-trained actors like
Chow Yen-fat and Michelle Yeoh

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#56:1:A>
Yes true <,> Tiger and Dragon is a terrific movie tribute to the
cinematic tradition

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#57:1:A>
But the same can be said with the equal relevance if films about
Robin Hood Joan of Arc King Arthur and Jesse James can be done in a similarly
lyrical stylish way

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#58:1:A>
What the best in filmmaking is telling us that we can live in the
world and the distinction that matter isn't about black and white yellow and
brown but between good and bad kitsch and genuine

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#59:1:A>
I enjoy and will long enjoy Tiger and Dragon because it  ' s the
touching story about loyalty the quest and righteousness done with the
flourish and shot through the lens of poetry

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#60:1:A>
I  ' m looking forward to more action film like it and to the ailing
Hong Kong film industry recovering from its current malaise and doing what
the crew of Tiger and Dragon did by making the big screen truly special
sensational and sensuous </I>

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#61:2:A>
The quest for the Asian Game is over

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#62:2:A>
The pursuit of the sports excellence is not done <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#63:2:A>
We did not win the Games

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#64:2:A>
We won new public awareness on sports

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#65:2:A>
Sports has forge character rally the community shape our identity
and strengthen our body and will

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#66:2:A>
I would like to think this victory of a special kind will endure
and society has changed because of it

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#67:2:A>
Certainly the government has raised its interest in sports

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#68:2:A>
The Education Department has belatedly pledged to weave sports into
its curriculum

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#69:2:A>
The Home Affair Bureau has turned sports into higher a priority

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#70:2:A>
The Chief Secretary has pledged a world class stadium a promise has
been twenty years in the making

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#71:2:A>
Some are rather <,> fixed about the size of the stadium

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#72:2:A>
They talk about seating capacity the way golf enthusiasts rave
about Tiger Wood  ' s strokes and scores

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#73:2:A>
Size isn't the crux of the issue

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#74:2:A>
Functionality is feasibility is esthetically is

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#75:2:A>
A stadium isn't just a venue for sports and pop concerts because it
can also be the object of art a statement of purpose and a tourist attraction
in its own right

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#76:2:A>
I was in Lebanon in October to attend the Asian Cup Football
Championship

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#77:2:A>
The city of Beirut has survived nearly two decades of civil war and
one of the first thing they did with reconstruction was to build three new
stadium for the Asian Cup tournament

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#78:2:A>
This is Beirut  ' s a way of telling the world it has just put the
<,> past behind it and will look to the future

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#79:2:A>
I was again in Guatemala City in the middle of November for the
World Futsal Indoor Championship

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#80:2:A>
Guatemalans built a new arena for the event also to <.> si </.>
signify its emergence from a long conflict

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#81:2:A>
This is what sports can do for a country senses of self confidence
and purpose

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#82:2:A>
I think many advanced city city we have been urged to emulate
flaunt the stadium as those were shrines

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#83:2:A>
For many youth in the other society the dream is not to be
presidents nor premiers but to be athletes and artists performing in those
mystical stadiums and arenas

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#84:2:A>
The baseball player know that he has arrived when he hit the
homerun at Yankee Stadium

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#85:2:A>
The boxer realized he is a hero of the hour to headline a bill at
the Madison Square Garden

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#86:2:A>
The Beatles marked their popularity by playing in the sellout crowd
at the old Wembley now to be torn down for the twenty-one century replacement

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#87:2:A>
For the Australian the pinnacle was celebrating Cathy Freeman the
track champion at the Stadium Australia in Homebush Sydney not just for her
win but what she symbolized the racial conciliation for their country

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#88:2:A>
To this day when we speak of awe the grandeur of Rome what do we
think of the monument to that ancient glory other than the Coliseum

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#89:2:A>
Those original appearance was digitally recreated for the film
Gladiator

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#90:2:A>
Other city aspire for respectability may invest in and if need be
sell bond to pay for their stadium

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#91:2:A>
I think that  ' s happen in Beijing in Shanghai even nearby Guangzhou
whose Olympic Stadium has opened to global tender

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#92:2:A>
Everywhere I look from the far away and close to the north of Hong
Kong I see stadiums and arenas rising as testimony to cities coming of age

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#93:2:A>
We are perhaps the lone exception and ironically that  ' s where
boast some of the finest most imaginative architecture anywhere especially I
think in our private sector that they have monuments to ingenuity and
practicality

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#94:2:A>
Recently I was in New York where I met the famed architecture Peter
Eisenman

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#95:2:A>
He  ' s currently working on the waterfront renaissance of his home
city specially the Staten Island Institute of Art and Science

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#96:2:A>
He  ' s also completed the poignant Berlin Memorial to the Murdered
Jew of Europe

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#97:2:A>
Mr Eisenman has returned once more to stadium design after the
creative pause

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#98:2:A>
I asked him in my innocence why an esthete like him want to design
stadiums including the new innovative multipurpose Arizona Exposition
Convention Center called Rio Salado Crossing

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#99:2:A>
The Arizona project is a marvel because of its curvaceous
appearance suggesting a perpetual movement and the use of space under the
around the stadium complex

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#100:2:A>
Mr Eisenman replied because I love sports

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#101:2:A>
To design a stadium is to love it and what it stand for how
elegant simple marvelous and true

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#102:2:A>
I think the hope of many here that more of our public work can be
done not by rote by through abiding love a love registered every detail which
we all can participate

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#103:2:A>
The world has moved on from colossal stadium to one that fit the
requirement and budget of cities

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#104:2:A>
Some are bandied about seventy five thousand plus seats stadium
for Hong Kong to be built in East Kowloon at the old Kai Tak Airport

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#105:2:A>
Other haven't dwelled on size but on infrastructure location and
scope of the enterprise

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#106:2:A>
Now we must add two more item to the list feasibility and beauty

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#107:2:A>
I have been to enough stadium to grasp <,> the folly of
maintaining venue that cannot be fully utilized

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#108:2:A>
We in Hong Kong has a responsibility to ensure the many future
stadium mustn't be dragged on a treasury and that is something that we
cherish and not something we merely tout because of we have it

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#109:2:A>
Today there are several renowned stadium designer who think the
artist an economist a once

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#110:2:A>
We shall have their service by opening other stadium bid to
international tender

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#111:2:A>
We can afford stadium that panache but cannot afford one that
merely met a bureaucratic quota

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#112:2:A>
We want a stadium to be a place where they bring people together
and not a controversy that wedge us apart

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#113:2:A>
But above all else this stadium of ours must inspire inspire our
young athletes and artists as Yankee Stadium the Madison Square Garden and
Wembley do as shrines to dreams and theaters to legend

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#114:2:A>
We live in a democratic age

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#115:2:A>
The government must consult rather ignore the public and the
interest group from the civic to the environmental because a public-funded
stadium by definition is a public enterprise rather than a strict
bureaucratic brief

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#116:2:A>
I think Hong Kong is fortunate in having so many people who has
traveled lived abroad educated overseas and genuinely informed I think
including those of you listening to the program today

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#117:2:A>
We have seen a lot and we have dined at the banquet of cultures

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#118:2:A>
The passion and knowledge of our people are a wonderful resources
for our government to tap

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#119:2:A>
I suggest that the public consultation should be a requirement for
the future designer who has win the contract

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#120:2:A>
This way we the public will feel a special responsibility for and
attachment to the stadium that reflected our beloved city rather than
singular obsession of any single individual or his or her solitary vision

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#121:2:A>
We also will wait a generation for a stadium has match our
expectation can wait a wee while longer to get one which we show the world
our achievement and showcase our achievers

<ICE-HK:S2B-033#122:2:A>
Our athletes or artists refuse to wait another generation for the
stadium that is their stage for the performance of their lives </I>
