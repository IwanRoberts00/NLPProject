<bold> My Window </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#2:1>
I love the scene outside my window :

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#3:1>
in the morning , birds are flying gaily in the sky and jumping between
the tree branches &semi;

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#4:1>
a beam of sunlight and a gentle breeze makes your whole day fresh .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#5:1>
In the afternoon , girls play basketball happily at the far end of the
playground .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#6:1>
Their screams always make my heart jump .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#7:1>
Night is the calmest time .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#8:1>
All you can hear is the lullaby sung by the grasshoppers .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#9:1>
A few bright stars blink their eyes and watch you sleep . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#10:1>
However , I could only enjoy these lovely scenes and share the
happiness of the birds and the girls from behind the window in my room . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#11:1>
There was a knock at my door .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#12:1>
Clare  ' s face appeared through the gap between the door and the wall .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#13:1>
&ldquo; Hi !

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#14:1>
How do you feel today ? &rdquo; said Clare . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#15:1>
I gave her a big smile .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#16:1>
&ldquo; I  ' m very good .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#17:1>
What story you want me to tell you tonight ? &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#18:1>
Clare is my dorm-mate .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#19:1>
She is a year younger than me and has just entered the college this
year .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#20:1>
She was allocated to this dormitory and lives in the next room .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#21:1>
The first time I saw her , she was sobbing in the little garden at
the rear of the dormitory .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#22:1>
I came up to her and asked her what had made her so upset .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#23:1>
She rubbed her eyes and whispered , &ldquo; I miss my mom &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#24:1>
Then she threw herself toward me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#25:1>
I patted her shaking shoulders and led her to my room .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#26:1>
I told her a story of a little girl who had lost her mother when she
was born .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#27:1>
She struggled to make a living and she encountered many hardships .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#28:1>
Finally , her talent was discovered and she started a new meaningful
life .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#29:1>
Clare loved the story and asked if she could be the same as the girl .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#30:1>
I said : &ldquo; Of course you can .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#31:1>
Besides , you are luckier than her as you have a mother who loves you
so much . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#32:1>
Clare grinned at me and the sadness in her face vanished .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#33:1>
Since then , when she feels unhappy or can't sleep , she comes and
asks me to tell her a story . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#34:1>
&ldquo; No .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#35:1>
But I  ' m very happy today .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#36:1>
Do you know why ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#37:1>
Let me tell you Sarah , our team won the basketball competition today !

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#38:1>
I made four baskets !

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#39:1>
Do you know how exciting the competition was ............ &rdquo;
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#40:1>
I can't remember what Clare said afterward .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#41:1>
At that moment , the picture I had seen in the afternoon floating in
my mind : through the window , I heard the sound from the playground .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#42:1>
A group of girls were running behind the ball .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#43:1>
Some were jumping , some were chasing behind the ball .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#44:1>
They were all shouting , like soldiers fighting at the front-line of
the battlefield .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#45:1>
A girl with a red ribbon in her ponytail caught my eye &semi; her
movements were full of energy .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#46:1>
Every time she leapt , the ball was fully in her control .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#47:1>
No one could get near her , or the ball .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#48:1>
She ran with ease , like a snake , so fast , without leaving a mark
on the ground . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#49:1>
My fingers were clinging to the window frame tightly and I hadn't
noticed that half of my body was exposed to the cool air outside .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#50:1>
I screamed loudly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#51:1>
Why couldn't I play like those girls ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#52:1>
Why couldn't I lead a life like them , or the birds ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#53:1>
Why could I only feel their happiness but not experience it myself ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#54:1>
Why should I suffer all these ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#55:1>
I kept shouting and shouting until I was pulled down by a pair of
hands and forced to lie in bed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#56:1>
I can't remember what happened next .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#57:1>
I must have lost consciousness . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#58:1>
When I was sleeping , I made a dream .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#59:1>
Through the window , a girl was dancing on the colourful butterflies
flying around her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#60:1>
With the birds singing with her , she sang as though she were talking
to herself : </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#61:1>
<it> &ldquo; I don't have to put on the thick clothes , I don't
need to take those pills .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#62:1>
What  ' s more is that I don't have to stay in bed anymore ! &rdquo;
</it> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#63:1>
The girl continued to sing and dance without a pause .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#64:1>
Though she was slim , there was a brush of pink in her cheeks .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#65:1>
She looked like someone I knew .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#66:1>
I tried to open the window to see clearly , but I couldn't .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#67:1>
I used my fists to hit it harder and hoped the girl would notice me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#68:1>
She didn't .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#69:1>
She kept dancing and gradually disappeared into the forest . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#70:1>
Some noises woke me up .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#71:1>
I opened my eyes and saw a woman wandering around .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#72:1>
My body was weak and I coughed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#73:1>
The woman turned and came to me . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#74:1>
&ldquo; Are you okay , Sarah ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#75:1>
You almost made me crazy !

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#76:1>
How could you be so silly &dash; not putting on a coat ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#77:1>
You should know how weak you are ! &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#78:1>
I recognised the voice .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#79:1>
She was my mother .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#80:1>
I couldn't figure out why she was here . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#81:1>
&ldquo; Miss Norma phoned me last night and said that you were
very ill and she saw you climbing out of the window .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#82:1>
What  ' s wrong with you ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#83:1>
And have you been taking the pills regularly ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#84:1>
Can't you remember what Dr. Watson said ? &rdquo; my mother said ,
almost shouting at me . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#85:1>
I didn't make a sound .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#86:1>
I didn't give a thought to her questions .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#87:1>
I just stared at the dark sky through my little gate to the outside
world , and I saw the happy girl dancing with the stars . </p> </I>

<I> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#88:2>
<bold> Farewell British Hong Kong </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#89:2>
Thick layers of clouds were floating in the sky .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#90:2>
Not even a single beam of light could penetrate them .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#91:2>
Together with the stifling air , a strange atmosphere was clogging
the territory on that day . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#92:2>
Turning on the television , I saw a number of advertisements
giving their congratulations and blessings to Hong Kong on its return to its
mother  ' s embrace .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#93:2>
Pictures of fireworks and congratulatory slogans were shown on the
screen : <it> &ldquo; Congratulations on the Establishment of The Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#94:2>
&ldquo; Embracing A New Era , Working Hand in Hand For The Future .
&rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#95:2>
&ldquo; Celebrating History in the making &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#96:2>
Let  ' s Create A Brighter Future For Hong Kong &rdquo; </it> etc .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#97:2>
Though the slogans were different and though we didn't have any
special food , it was just like the days during Lunar New Year , a festival
which is unimportant to me except for the pocket money and a few days of
holiday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#98:2>
News reporters appeared on the screen unusually frequently
throughout the day .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#99:2>
They reported the latest progress of the preparations for the change
of sovereignty ceremony at the Convention and Exhibition Centre , the arrival
of the Chinese and British government representatives and various public
celebrations .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#100:2>
Whenever the news stories of the <-> Pattern </-> <+> Patten </+>
family were mentioned , I paid all my attention to them .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#101:2>
I feared that I would miss something important . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#102:2>
Walking along the street , I saw all the passers-by wearing
different faces .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#103:2>
Happy , sad , ignorant or ............ ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#104:2>
I couldn't tell .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#105:2>
I didn't even know how I felt .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#106:2>
All I could feel was the high temperature .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#107:2>
Sweat kept flowing down my cheeks .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#108:2>
My head was damp as little drops of rain fell on me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#109:2>
However , they didn't cool me down during my journey . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#110:2>
People travelling on the MTR were reading the special reports in
the newspapers .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#111:2>
Big and colourful pictures of Prince Charles , ex-Governor Chris
Patten and the ex-Government House were below the headlines of the newspapers .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#112:2>
&lsquo; People were so engrossed in reading the details of the
stories .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#113:2>
On their faces was a mysterious look showing their uncertainty about
how different things would be several hours later . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#114:2>
Stepping out of the train and reaching the exit of the Causeway
Bay station , my destination was closer .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#115:2>
A crowd of people was gathering at the centre of Pacific Place .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#116:2>
Flashbulbs popped vigorously .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#117:2>
The people were screaming and shouting all around .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#118:2>
The beat of my heart became faster and faster as I caught sight of
the two men in suits &dash; Mr. Chris Patten and Mr. Tony Blair .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#119:2>
They smiled and waved to the crowd .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#120:2>
They stirred up an excited mood among the people .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#121:2>
The scene was very confused .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#122:2>
Mr. Patten shook hands with the people around him and others shouted
to him &ldquo; <it> Mr. Patten , we  ' ll miss you ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#123:2>
&ldquo; We love you , <indig> Fai Pang </indig> </it> &ldquo; ,

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#124:2>
I lost my senses in the crowd . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#125:2>
On my way home , my mind was as confused as the situation in the
shopping centre had been .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#126:2>
I didn't know what pushed me to go there , and what made me lose
myself .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#127:2>
I just knew that on that day , I had to go .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#128:2>
Before the handover ceremony , television stations broadcast the
farewell ceremony at East Tamar .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#129:2>
At the beginning , there was fine misty rain .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#130:2>
As the ceremony proceeded , drizzle became a downpour .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#131:2>
Prince Charles and the ex-Governor gave their speeches under the
torrential rain .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#132:2>
After his rain-soaked speech , Mr. Patten lowered his head and
choked back the tears . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#133:2>
Stepping onto the drenched parade ground , the British Forces
marched and saluted to the Prince and the dignitaries .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#134:2>
The combined forces also displayed a choreographed parade that ended
with a volley of rifle-fire .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#135:2>
At the same time , the military bands performed the traditional
military music solemnly with pipes and drums .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#136:2>
Under the downpour , the British pomp was strangely solemn and calm .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#137:2>
The music coming from the bagpipes sounded forlorn and lost when
mixed with the scene .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#138:2>
It was supposed to be a sunset ceremony , but the sky was so dark
that no one could tell exactly when the sun did set on the British Empire .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#139:2>
The handover ceremony at the Convention and Exhibition Centre
was a grand and dignified one , and also , the most unforgettable one .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#140:2>
After the speeches of the Chinese and British highest government
officials , the historic moment at last came &dash; The British Union Jack
was hauled down by a British guard just before midnight and it was replaced
by the red flag with yellow stars of the People  ' s Republic at the stroke of
midnight by a mainland guard .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#141:2>
My heart suffocated at that moment .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#142:2>
With the folding of the Union Jack , the history of Hong Kong as a
British colony was covered by a veil . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#143:2>
After all these events in one day , I crawled to bed as my
family was still watching the rest of the ceremony on television .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#144:2>
The sad and tearful expression of the ex-Governor had left a mark on
my heart . </p> </I>

<I> <h>

STEPHANIE LUI PO MAN </h> <h>

FORTUNE TELLER </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-004#147:3>
<indig> Wang Shi Fu </indig> told me that the Year of the Hare
would not be good for me because I was born in the Year of the Tiger .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#148:3>
Don't do any business or investments throughout the year so as to
avoid incurring losses .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#149:3>
Speculation will not yield any profit for me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#150:3>
Especially don't invest in the property market since my <indig> <it>
bazi </it> </indig> <fnr> &asterisk; </fr> belongs to the gold out of the
five elements .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#151:3>
<footnote> &asterisk; <indig> <it> bazi </it> </indig> means a
person  ' s lunar date and hour of birth . </footnote>

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#152:3>
Investing in the stock market is only advantageous in June ,
September and October .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#153:3>
Don't buy and sell stocks in the other months even though there are
opportunities to reap profits because his words are always true .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#154:3>
Don't change jobs .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#155:3>
Stay in the original work position and the chance of promotion will
come in winter .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#156:3>
No matter how nasty my boss is , I will not quit my job .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#157:3>
Besides , put a copper vase on my desk facing the south to increase
my career luck .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#158:3>
Remember it must be made of copper , not any other material .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#159:3>
Don't drive or ride in my car in August for I may have a fatal
accident .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#160:3>
I will try to avoid travelling in the car by going to work on foot
and travelling to Kowloon by ferry .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#161:3>
What should I do if I have to go to the New Territories ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#162:3>
I should ask him about that .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#163:3>
Don't travel abroad during the Chinese New Year since I may be
robbed on the trip .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#164:3>
April is very crucial for me because I will meet a man who was born
in the Year of the Dragon .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#165:3>
He will become my husband and be the person who brings me luck and
happiness .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#166:3>
So if I meet a man who was born in the Year of the Dragon in April ,
whatever he looks like I will grasp the chance to date him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#167:3>
Don't wear any black clothes throughout the year because the water
out of the five elements will bring bad luck .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#168:3>
Black represents water , so I  ' d better use another color leather
wallet instead of my black leather one .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#169:3>
Don't wear the black-rimmed spectacles as well .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#170:3>
However , red is good for me because my <indig> <it> bazi </it>
</indig> needs more fire and red represents fire , so I should buy more red
clothes and dye my hair red .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#171:3>
Finally , don't lend money to friends because they will not pay me
back and will run away .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#172:3>
Oh , when Ka Wah asks me to pay for his lunch next time , I will
definitely reject him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-004#173:3>
Don't be skeptical about the words of the <indig> Feng Shui Shi Fu
</indig> because they are always right . </p> </I>
