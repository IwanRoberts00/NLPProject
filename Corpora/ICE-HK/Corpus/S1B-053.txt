<ICE-HK:S1B-053#1:1:A>
To wit that in his in the usual flamboyant state the policy
address has indicated that in health care for example there will be more
public hospitals more specialist services etcetera <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#2:1:A>
In his usual jubilation the Governor took pride in announcing that
there will be a five per cent <,> increase in in-patients and twenty four per
cent increase in out-patient service uh of the government medical <.> s </.>
unit uh service this year

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#3:1:A>
All these are laudable and no one should dispute the principle
improving public health care services

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#4:1:A>
Yet until and unless government promises unlimited financial support
<,> these services could only be maintained at the expense of increasing
staff working hours and longer waiting queues for treatment <,> contrary to
the pledges made by the Hospital Authority <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#5:1:A>
With no health policy with no health financing policy to guide us
<,> with the existing issue of a limited <.> f </.> public fund to cater for
unlimited services <,> we will soon be moving down the failure route of the
problem-laden <.> Na </.> National Health Services of the United Kingdom <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#6:1:A>
Sir for years the public the medical profession and different
political parties have yearned for government to come out with a <.> poli
</.> of a political policy decision <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#7:1:A>
Promises have been made <,> but unfortunately never materialised<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#8:1:A>
<?> Sir </?> this week Hong Kong plays host to some five thousand
dentists from some seventy countries around the world <,> at the Federation
of Dental International Annual World Congress uh Dental Congress

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#9:1:A>
This is an important milestone for Hong Kong dentists as it has
found a place in the world map of dentistry

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#10:1:A>
Rightly so <,> that deputy to the Governor officiate the opening
ceremony to give this meeting its due importance and to symbolise government  ' s
commitment to oral health needs and development of the profession

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#11:1:A>
Rightly so too <,> that deputy to the Governor took pride on the
dental progress so far in Hong Kong especially after fluoridisation of our
water

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#12:1:A>
But ironically <,> in the same opening ceremony the President of
this international organisation has this to say and I quote <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#X13:1:A>
<quote> in the developed countries where dental caries have shown
a decline but is now levelled-off there is a tendency and a risk that oral
health is considered by the Health Authority to be a non-issue <,> and so is
ignored in any health policy or strategy </quote> </X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#14:1:A>
Unquote

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#15:1:A>
Sir is Hong Kong heading this same direction or is Hong Kong
already there before we begin and has Hong Kong a proper dental policy anyway
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#16:1:A>
Government <?> departments </?> will no doubt come to the defence
that there is an on-going policy which is to promote oral health education
and awareness <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#17:1:A>
Repeatedly governments has denied access to public funded dental
care by the public on the grounds of gigantic cost <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#18:1:A>
Recently the Department of Health went to the extent of quoting
that only ten per cent of the surveyed population adults had not visit
private dentist because they are unable to pay

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#19:1:A>
In short there  ' s no need to provide public dental treatment
services

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#20:1:A>
Yet having a general check is one thing but the cost of having your
teeth done up is another which many could not afford <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#21:1:A>
Even the ten per cent together with those receiving Comprehensive
Social Security Assistance form a formidable population who needs oral health
care which is wanted <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#22:1:A>
Government has always claimed that no one will be deprived of
sufficient health care due to lack of means

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#23:1:A>
Yet <,> when it comes to oral health an important element <.> o
</.> of one  ' s total health it is obviously another story <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#24:1:A>
Government will boost will boast that there are some fifty-eight
government dental clinics and two hundred and eleven dental offices a
seventeen per cent increase since nineteen ninety-two

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#25:1:A>
But do not forget <,> the service is mainly to cater for a
contractual obligation government has made with its civil servants <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#26:1:A>
Even then there is a need to have a performance pledge

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#27:1:A>
For many even our civil servants in this chamber today seek private
dental service on their own being unable to <?> stay in </?> the long queue

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#28:1:A>
It is utmost that oral health care uh must be given the importance
<?> that it </?> deserve <,> be taken as an essential integral part of total
health care and should in no way be taken as a poor second after medical
services <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#29:1:A>
A proper dental policy must therefore be developed

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#30:1:A>
It must work with concrete plans to materialise oral health goals
for different age bands of Hong Kong by the year two thousand and ten set by
the Dentist Sub-committee the government  ' s own advisory body

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#31:1:A>
How much would government consider oral health as a welfare and how
much would government provide as a service for a fee <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#32:1:A>
It is only with answers to these that a proper dental manpower for
this operation could be work out and a workable ratio between the private and
public dental services could be identified <.> well </.> uh uh to provide a
well-balanced service that we <.> s </.> needed so much

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#33:1:A>
For years government has pledged to provide dental care for groups
with special needs <,> disabled people with special medical condition
etcetera

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#34:1:A>
It is high time these get to going and it  ' s high time that the
needy elderlies should be taken also into into its wings

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#35:1:A>
Sir while the transfer of sovereignty has everything to do with
land <,,> the six million people of Hong Kong still have to face the problem
of education <,> housing <,> welfare transport and health care irrespective
of before or after nineteen ninety-seven <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#36:1:A>
It is good news that governments across the board have discussed to
allow children in China who have the right of abode in Hong Kong to enter the
territory uhm systematically in a bid to ease the likely pressure <,> by
nineteen ninety-seven

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#37:1:A>
It is also right direction for the administration to at least
ponder measures encountering the impact of migrants from China on education
and housing though still far from satisfactory

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#38:1:A>
Yet how much how about the impact on welfare health care other
social infrastructure

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#39:1:A>
These areas are conveniently forgotten in the address

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#40:1:A>
Instead of blowing its own trumpet <,> being contented in a
short-term achievement in terms of superficial figures now more than ever we
need long-term policies in various livelihood areas

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#41:1:A>
We need direction with vision to guide us into the next decade <,,>
lest the Special Administrative Region will be left a potato too hot to
handle <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#42:1:A>
One may argue that the virtue of a sunset government should be to
keep status quo

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#43:1:A>
Yet beyond the calendar of <.> thir </.> of the thirtieth of June
nineteen ninety-seven it would still be the vast Hong Kong public who would
have to keep living here breathe here facing a livelihood problems
irrespective of whether it is under the Union Jack or the Red Flag with the
Five Stars <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#44:1:A>
Any responsible government must ensure good governance with policy
directions planned ahead for the subject

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#45:1:A>
Sir <,> our government at least owe us that

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#46:1:A>
Mr President time will not allow me to go through all the issues
covered by the address

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#47:1:A>
I  ' m sure other members will amply reflect their views <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#48:1:A>
With those words I do so move

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-053#49:1:B>
I now propose the question to you and that is that this
council thanks the Governor for his address

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#50:1:B>
Does any member wish to speak

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#51:1:B>
Dr David Lee

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-053#52:1:C>
Mr President

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#53:1:C>
Two weeks ago like a class of new student at the start of term
fifty-nine Legislative Councillor gather in this chamber

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#54:1:C>
We eagerly anticipate a fresh start a clean slate new lessons to be
learnt new goals to be achieve

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#55:1:C>
But what we got was more of the same from last term

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#56:1:C>
This policy address is no vision

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#57:1:C>
It is a revision

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#58:1:C>
True the administration get top marks <,> for addressing what are
for our community life or death issues housing <,> slope steep slope slope
steep stability health care <,,> safety in the workplace

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#59:1:C>
However the administration failed to say anything substantive about
a less tangible but more fundamental subject our competitiveness

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#60:1:C>
Imagine Mr <O> four-Cantonese-words </O> sitting at his desk on
Monday morning

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#61:1:C>
Mr Ho is an entrepreneur the boss of a small trading company that
employ five people

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#62:1:C>
Mr Ho is reading the Morning Post

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#63:1:C>
Ah he thinks to himself Hong Kong has been named one of the most
competitive economy in the world

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#64:1:C>
He is proud of Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#65:1:C>
Proud of his hard work makes a difference not only to his family
but to his five employees <,> and to his community

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#66:1:C>
Mr Ho turn the page

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#67:1:C>
He sigh

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#68:1:C>
Inflation has fallen to just nine per cent

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#69:1:C>
He shakes his head wondering if government economists ever buy food

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#70:1:C>
If they pay for their own transport how do they come up with all
these statistics

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#71:1:C>
He folds the paper away and turn to his mail

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#72:1:C>
Mr Ho open the top letter and shudders <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#73:1:C>
His landlord wanted to raise his office rent by twenty-five per
cent

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#74:1:C>
Everywhere cost is going up and up

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#75:1:C>
He think to himself no wonder orders are falling

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#76:1:C>
People in Hong Kong cannot afford to go shopping

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#77:1:C>
He has good relationship with the retailers he supplies

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#78:1:C>
Over the years he has become friends with many of them

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#79:1:C>
Mr Ho frowns himself

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#80:1:C>
He knows that like him <,> they are struggling <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#81:1:C>
Then there is a knock on at at Mr Ho  ' s door

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#82:1:C>
Mr Ho  ' s face brightened

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#83:1:C>
It was his favourite employee the hardworking Mr <O> -
seven-Cantonese-words </O>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#84:1:C>
Mr Dai sits down and begins talk to Mr Ho

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#85:1:C>
He wants a raise

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#86:1:C>
He is trying to save money to buy a flat but everywhere is so
expensive <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#87:1:C>
Mr Ho says he understands

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#88:1:C>
He tells Mr Dai that he will do what he can and Mr Dai leaves his
the office

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#89:1:C>
Mr Ho look back at the newspaper headline <,> one of the most
competitive economy in the world

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#90:1:C>
He wonder briefly who decides these things and how

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#91:1:C>
He wonder what it really means but <.> mos </.> mostly he wonder
how he will make ends meet

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#92:1:C>
Think of all the goods the administration hopes to do

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#93:1:C>
Think of all the money the administration has spent and is
committing Hong Kong to spend <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#94:1:C>
This expenditure is made possible by one by just one factors Hong
Kong economics competitiveness

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#95:1:C>
Only competitiveness can create opportunity for people like Mr Ho
and his employees

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#96:1:C>
Only competitiveness can generate jobs for the unemployed

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#97:1:C>
Only competitiveness can ensure funds are available for public
housing and for social services

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#98:1:C>
Only competitiveness deliver prosperity

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#99:1:C>
But did we hear anything constructive about our endangered
competitiveness in the policy address

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#100:1:C>
Sadly no <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#101:1:C>
Instead we were told the social service are one of the rewards of
our economic success

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#102:1:C>
This is a dangerous fallacy <,> an outmoded <.> att </.> attitude
that must be rooted out as if it is it were some deadly disease

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#103:1:C>
Expanding social services are not a reward <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#104:1:C>
They are <,> the restitution made because an economy no longer
offer each and every citizens the opportunity to earn a <unc> one-word
</unc> decent livelihood

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#105:1:C>
If we loose our competitiveness we could become like Britain <,> a
welfare state

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#106:1:C>
Its people living of yesterday  ' s capital and surviving on
tomorrow  ' s debt service

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#107:1:C>
Is this a state we want <.> ou </.> for our people <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#108:1:C>
Is this what they deserve

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#109:1:C>
And the scientific survey may rank Hong Kong among the world  ' s
most competitive economies

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#110:1:C>
Does that help the thousands who are unemployed <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#111:1:C>
Does that matters to the <.> m </.> multi-national who are voting
with their wallets and moving their office and their jobs out of Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#112:1:C>
The bottom line is this <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#113:1:C>
The competitiveness of Hong Kong  ' s economy is threatened

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#114:1:C>
The pillar of our success are being weakened <,> by insidious
inflation <,> by disabling lack of skills <,> by crippling land prices and
rental <,> by infrastructural <.> bo </.> bottlenecks

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#115:1:C>
Yet the administrations offer no real remedies for these ills

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#116:1:C>
The administration needs to recognise that competitiveness must be
declared its priority job number one

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#117:1:C>
It should establish a competitiveness committee a high-level panel
mandated to conduct a comprehensive annual audit of our competitiveness <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#118:1:C>
It would examine everything from human and physical infrastructure
to regulations and taxation

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#119:1:C>
It would measure Hong Kong against our would-be rivals

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#120:1:C>
It would assess where we are against <,> where we want to be <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#121:1:C>
Then it would publish its findings

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#122:1:C>
Based on its report the committee could advise the <.> admi </.>
the administration on solutions <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#123:1:C>
Using this audit the administration would set competitiveness
commitments

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#124:1:C>
The audit would become a vital diagnostic tool as the Financial
Secretary prepared budget each year

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#125:1:C>
We would not need to waste time or money or misguided effort
because we would know what initiatives were needed

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#126:1:C>
Our priorities would be clear <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#127:1:C>
Do we need to adjust our tax policies <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#128:1:C>
Do we need to release more land <,> or are our our <?>
infrastructual </?> link to the New Territories and the <.> st </.> state of
our environment more pressing priorities

<ICE-HK:S1B-053#129:1:C>
Whatever we may need an audit would help us present a strong case
as we seek China  ' s advice and support </I>
