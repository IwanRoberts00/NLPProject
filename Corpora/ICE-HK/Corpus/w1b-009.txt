Christa ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-009#2:1>
About you want to save the mail to disk , it is <-> possilble </->
<+> possible </+> , but I don't know exactly what you want .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#3:1>
There is two situations .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#4:1>
One is when you have a PC and a modem at home , you can download to
your own computer , then save to a disk .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#5:1>
That is the easy way to do .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#6:1>
Unfortunately that not what you want , right ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#7:1>
If you want to know this way , send me another mail , I will send more
informations on this .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#8:1>
Second way is you are using the computer at U .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#9:1>
That is more difficult than using a PC at home .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#10:1>
I will try my best to describe what is going on , but I can't
guarantee it work .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#11:1>
OK , here it  ' s go . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-009#12:1>
First , enter your account as usual , then go to &ldquo; pine
&rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#13:1>
<-> Hightligft </-> <+> highlight </+> the mail you want to save in
disk .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#14:1>
then type &ldquo; <mention> s </mention> &ldquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#15:1>
At the bottom of the screen , it may ask you if you want to save the
mail or <-> somthing </-> <+> something </+> like that .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#16:1>
Type in the file name you want the mail to be .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#17:1>
Then it will ask you want to <-> creat </-> <+> create </+> a new
folder for the new file , then type &ldquo; <mention> y </mention> &ldquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#18:1>
Then I think there is a &ldquo; <mention> D </mention> &ldquo; beside
the mail you just save .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#19:1>
That mean they will delete that mail .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#20:1>
So when it ask do you want to delete the mail , you type &ldquo; n
&rdquo; because you don't want to lose <-> you </-> <+> your </+> mail at
this point .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#21:1>
If something wrong with the save file , you still have the backup .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#22:1>
After this , you exit &ldquo; pine &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#23:1>
Second thing is to locate your file you just saved .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#24:1>
Type &ldquo; <mention> cd </mention> &ldquo; to go back to the root
directory .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#25:1>
Then type &ldquo; <mention> ls - a </mention> &ldquo; to see if the
file you saved is in it .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#26:1>
If it is not , go to &ldquo; mail &rdquo; or &ldquo; Mail &rdquo;
directory , by <-> typeing </-> <+> typing </+> &ldquo; <mention> cd mail
</mention> &ldquo; or &ldquo; <mention> cd Mail </mention> &ldquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#27:1>
&ldquo; mail &rdquo; and &ldquo; Mail &rdquo; is two different
directory ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#28:1>
don't mix them up .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#29:1>
After you have locate your saved file , you may logout to your system
, but you have to remember what directory of your file located .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#30:1>
That is important ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#31:1>
if you don't remember where it locate , you can't get the file .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#32:1>
After you logout , go to the main screen of your computer ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#33:1>
I mean the screen that when you first boot up the computer .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#34:1>
That is the problem part because I don't remember what items are on
that screen .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#35:1>
So you may have to search for what you need , but the other way is to
ask the help desk on this topic .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#36:1>
Alright back to the subject .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#37:1>
One more thing from this point forward ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#38:1>
I just guess what would happen to your screen .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#39:1>
I really have no ideas .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#40:1>
If what you see is not what I describe , you have to describe what
you saw and send a mail to me as detail as possible .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#41:1>
You have to find &ldquo; ftp &rdquo; or &ldquo; FTP &rdquo; on the
screen .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#42:1>
It usually still in the communication menu .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#43:1>
In communication menu , you may ask to choose &ldquo; telnet &rdquo;
or &ldquo; ftp &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#44:1>
Then choose &ldquo; ftp &rdquo; this time .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#45:1>
Then choose the site your file locate like &ldquo; hkusub.hku.hk
&rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#46:1>
If you don't find the site you need , try to look for &ldquo; other
site &rdquo; then type in the site you need .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#47:1>
It may ask you to login , so login as usual telnet account .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#48:1>
After you are in the account , go to the directory your file located .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#49:1>
You can still use &ldquo; cd &rdquo; and &ldquo; ls &rdquo; to look
for the file .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#50:1>
After you located your file , type &ldquo; <mention> get filename
</mention> &ldquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#51:1>
&ldquo; get &rdquo; is a comment to transfer the file to the <->
harddrive </-> <+> hard drive </+> .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#52:1>
&ldquo; filename &rdquo; is the name of your file .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#53:1>
Then you have to wait for few seconds or few minutes depend on the
size of your file .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#54:1>
When it finish , it will tell you the file is completely <->
transfered </-> <+> transferred </+> or <-> somethings </-> <+> something
</+> like that .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#55:1>
After that you can exit ftp by type &ldquo; <mention> quit </mention>
&ldquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#56:1>
That will bring you back to the communication menu screen .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#57:1>
After that you have to go to &ldquo; Windows 3.1 &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#58:1>
Go to the &ldquo; File Manager &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#59:1>
You have to search where is your file locate ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#60:1>
that <-> somethings </-> <+> something </+> I really can't help you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#61:1>
Because they may have many network drive , my best guess is on the
root directory of the first network drive .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#62:1>
That mean the first drive that after the <-> floppydisk </-> <+>
floppy disk </+> drive .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#63:1>
After you locate your file on drive , then highlight the file by
single click the right mouse button on the file .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#64:1>
Go to &ldquo; <mention> Edit </mention> &ldquo; menu , choose &ldquo;
<mention> Copy </mention> &ldquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#65:1>
then it will ask you where you want to save .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#66:1>
Type &ldquo; <mention> a:\ </mention> &ldquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#67:1>
&ldquo; <mention> a:\ </mention> &ldquo; is the <-> floppydisk </->
<+> floppy disk </+> drive name .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#68:1>
So if you want to save to drive b , you will type &ldquo; <mention>
b:\ </mention> &ldquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#69:1>
And that should do it .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#70:1>
If you want to make sure the file is <-> copyed </-> <+> copied </+>
, you can right click on the drive to see your file is in it or not .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#71:1>
Also you may want to delete the file you left in the <-> harddrive
</-> <+> hard drive </+> .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#72:1>
If you can't get it to work , my advice is go to ask the help desk .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#73:1>
Or you have to send me detail on what you and see on the screen .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#74:1>
I know it  ' s a sloppy job , but hope this will help . </p>

<p> Next week is Spring break , so if you read this mail Thursday , and
return me a message on Friday if you find any problem , I may still send you
some advice if I have any , before I take the trip to LA .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#75:1>
So wish you luck with your work . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#76:1>

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#77:2>
Christa ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-009#78:2>
About the computer work , actually what part did you have the
problem ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#79:2>
If you can say it , I may able to fix it .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#80:2>
Also if you did not catch what the people in help desk told you , ask
them again .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#81:2>
Ask them to slow down , and said you are not experience with computer
, and what part you did not get right .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#82:2>
They are able to help you again .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#83:2>
They are <-> payed </-> <+> paid </+> to help the students who are
not good at computer , so they should have <-> patient </-> <+> patience </+>
to help you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#84:2>
Don't get discourage if you did not get it in the first time . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-009#85:2>
About your project , I am willing to participate in it .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#86:2>
It seem like very interesting .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#87:2>
But I have one request , I would like to see the result after you
have done your analysis .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#88:2>
My age group is 20-25 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-009#89:2>
I am in LA this week , but it is a sad week for me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#90:2>
My U did poorly in basketball this week .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#91:2>
First we lost to Arizona State University at home .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#92:2>
Second we lost in the first round in the NCAA tournament .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#93:2>
These really bother me a lot .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#94:2>
I can only hope they will do better next year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-009#95:2>
I have <-> brought </-> <+> bought </+> 3 CDs in LA .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#96:2>
They are Welcome Back by Pricilla Chan , Just wake up from dream by
Cass Pang , and All time favourite by Shirley Kwan .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#97:2>
I would not say anything about these CDs , because I still need some
time to listen to it .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#98:2>
I have just listen to them once . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-009#99:2>
I think I will stop here for this time because I need to some
times to prepare for the <-> backetball </-> <+> basketball </+> practice
this afternoon .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#100:2>
I just came back last night .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#101:2>
Most of my things still in the bag .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#102:2>
So talk to you <-> latter </-> <+> later </+> .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#103:2>
Take care . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#104:2>

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#105:3>
Christa ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-009#106:3>
There is one thing happen in this week that I did not tell you ,
or you may already heard before .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#107:3>
There is a rumor that Michael <-> Jordon </-> <+> Jordan </+> is
coming back to play basketball .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#108:3>
This rumor started on last week that he announce that he retired
from baseball , and will practice with Bulls on Monday and Tuesday .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#109:3>
That is the indication of coming back .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#110:3>
Finally he announced he will play the rest of the basketball <->
reason </-> <+> season </+> in Bulls started on this Sunday .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#111:3>
The announcement is made on today .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#112:3>
I will post you a report after I watch the game tomorrow . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#113:3>
Later !

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#114:3>
Dave . </I>

<I>

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#115:4>
Christa ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-009#116:4>
As I said before , I will give you some <-> informations </->
<+> information </+> of Michael Jordan came back from basketball .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#117:4>
Bulls has played three games after Jordan came back .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#118:4>
They has played Indiana Pacers on road and lost on overtime , played
Boston Celtics in Boston and won , and finally last night played Orlando
Magic in new United center at Chicago and lost .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#119:4>
By the way , he was not wearing &hash;23 ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#120:4>
he is wearing &hash;45 now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#121:4>
The reason for this because &hash;23 is the number that his father
saw him last played .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#122:4>
And his father was murdered in 1993 before Jordan retirement . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-009#123:4>
Here  ' re the details of those games .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#124:4>
In the first game , Jordan has played 43 minutes .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#125:4>
7 for 28 field goals , and have 19 points .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#126:4>
He has 3 steals , 6 rebounds , and 6 assists .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#127:4>
His shots were off .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#128:4>
And he was very tired .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#129:4>
This sign showed in the end of the regular game time ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#130:4>
he has leg cramp .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#131:4>
He did not have a slam dunk in this game .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#132:4>
In the second game , he only played 26 minutes due to the early
fouls trouble .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#133:4>
He got 3 fouls in the first 4 or 5 minutes , so he has to sit for
the quarter .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#134:4>
In the first few minutes he played in the first quarter , he was 3
for 3 in the field , included a 3-pointer .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#135:4>
He got 27 points and 9 for 17 shooting , 1 steals , 3 rebounds , and
4 assists .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#136:4>
The final score was Bulls 124 , Celtics 107 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#137:4>
The third game is in United center .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#138:4>
This is the first home game for Bulls after Jordan came back .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#139:4>
Also this is the first game that Jordan play in this building
because United center was open after Jordan retirement .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#140:4>
This meant a lot in Chicago .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#141:4>
The ticket price goes sky high .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#142:4>
This was a real close game .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#143:4>
It could win by either team .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#144:4>
The biggest lead of both teams were 6 to 7 points .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#145:4>
And it swung back and forth .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#146:4>
The final score was Bulls 99 , and Magic 106 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#147:4>
Jordan has 21 points , 7 for 23 shooting , 5 steals , 4 rebounds ,
and 8 assists .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#148:4>
He still need more time to work on his shot .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#149:4>
But I think his shooting will be back <-> somedays </-> <+> some day
</+> before playoff this year .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#150:4>
Bulls also have a game tonight at Atlanta ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#151:4>
Hope they will win .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#152:4>
<O> 3-emoticons </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-009#153:4>
I think I will come back to HK on May 20th , so I will miss the
Grasshopper concert also .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#154:4>
That  ' s sad .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#155:4>
If you can get good seat in Shirley Kwan concert , get me two
tickets &semi;

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#156:4>
otherwise , just get me one is enough .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#157:4>
I think I have no more to say this week because I was so busy
watching basketball game and did nothing .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#158:4>
So long . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#159:4>
Dave . </I>

<I>

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#160:5>
Dear Alyson ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-009#161:5>
I  ' m so glad to receive your letter .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#162:5>
Thanks for your photos .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#163:5>
They  ' re so nice and beautiful .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#164:5>
I  ' m still working in the shipping company but no one knows I  ' m a
student .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#165:5>
I  ' ll resign on the 14th of August . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-009#166:5>
I  ' ve my A-level result on the 8th of July .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#167:5>
My results were not so good .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#168:5>
The best subject is English .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#169:5>
On the 14th of July , I was accepted by the University of Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#170:5>
I  ' ll take English as my major .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#171:5>
For minor subjects , I haven't decided yet .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#172:5>
Since the tertiary education is expanding , I  ' m lucky to get a
place in the university .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#173:5>
In the past , I won't be accepted by the university as the results
were not outstanding . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-009#174:5>
I haven't had enough sleep since 26/7 because the Olympic games
are really very attractive .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#175:5>
I won't sleep until 1:00 or 2:00 a.m. every night .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#176:5>
I love to watch gymnastics , swimming and diving .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#177:5>
What about you ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#178:5>
Before the start of the Olympic , many specialists said that with
the split of Soviet Union , the sports standard may be lowered .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#179:5>
However , the standard of the Unified Team is still very high as
reviewed by the number of good metals they got . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-009#180:5>
This summer I haven't had enough sport activities since most of
my time is occupied by my job .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#181:5>
Even there are Sundays and Saturday afternoons , I didn't have a
chance to enjoy any of my favourite sports .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#182:5>
It is because the squash courts , tennis courts are fully booked .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#183:5>
Besides , nearly all the beaches and swimming pools are filled with
people .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#184:5>
The water of the swimming pools is terrible ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#185:5>
they  ' re just like a large bathing pool .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#186:5>
I hope after my resign , I  ' ll have more time for sports . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-009#187:5>
I think my plan for travelling overseas have to be postponed
since after my resign I have to join 2 camps organized by the university .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#188:5>
More than that there are several days for registration and returning
forms .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#189:5>
Three of my good friends will still with me ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#190:5>
I mean study in the University of Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#191:5>
One of my good friends will go into the Chinese University and
another one will go into the Polytechnic .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#192:5>
Though I  ' ve 3 good friends in the University of Hong Kong , we
study different subjects .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#193:5>
Therefore , we have to meet new friends but I  ' m sure we  ' ll still
be good friends forever as we have been good friends for over 7 years .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#194:5>
Whenever we  ' ve time , we  ' ll meet again . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-009#195:5>
There are Halls for students to stay in the university campus .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#196:5>
For me , I won't apply for room because the places available were
very limited and only those very active students get the chances especially
those who are good at sports .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#197:5>
A trip from home to the university takes 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours , it
isn't a very long journey , so I decide to study at home . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-009#198:5>
How is you and Alex ?

I believe racial discrimination still exist in this world though
people always stress on equality .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#201:5>
&obrack; But I  ' m not saying your parents are racist . &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#202:5>

accept him as one of your friend but as time pass by , they may change their
attitude .

Dear Alyson ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-009#218:6>
It is so glad to receive your letter .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#219:6>
In fact I want to write you a few weeks ago but since I haven't got
your new address .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#220:6>
I gave up . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-009#221:6>
Knowing that you  ' ve been very busy , I don't mind if you didn't
write me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#222:6>
I have been busy since the late Oct , occupying by homeworks and
tutorials .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#223:6>
Well there is a lot to talk about my 1st year university life in H.K .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#224:6>
University of H.K. is not so big in area as compare with any
university elsewhere but I always got my way lost in the first few days and I  ' ve
to take a map of the campus with me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#225:6>
Besides , many facilities of the university are outside the campus ,
such as the sports centre , student halls , far away from the campus .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#226:6>
Usually I take about 1 hr to go to school .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#227:6>
I have to take the MTR to Central and then get a change of mini-bus .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#228:6>
I remembered that in early Oct. I  ' ve got a traffic accident .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#229:6>
Lucky I didn't get hurt . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-009#230:6>
Let me tell you something about my study .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#231:6>
I take 4 courses in each semester .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#232:6>
the subjects that I  ' m taking are : English Studies , Introduction
to American Studies , Psychology , Sociology and English for Arts students .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#233:6>
For English , I have to study Macbeth &ampersand; Jane Eyre .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#234:6>
It is a bit difficult for me to start since I haven't had any
knowledge on literature in my secondary school days .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#235:6>
Sadly to say , I didn't get good marks for my essays .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#236:6>
English Studies also include linguistics which I also didn't have
any experience on it .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#237:6>
Moreover , tackling American Studies is an difficult task <O>
line-missing </O> of American history and leave the rest for us to look up
from the books suggested .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#238:6>
However , the suggested readings are always charged by the library .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-009#239:6>
This year I have a long Christmas holidays which I never have
because my term break will start on the 14th of Dec and go back to school on
8th of Jan , 93 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-009#240:6>
Apart from the long holidays , there are many other things that
are different from secondary school .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#241:6>
For example , 90&percent; of my lectures and tutorials are taught by
foreigners .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#242:6>
One thing I have gained from the university is that I  ' m no longer
hesitate to speak English since there are no other ways to communicate with
them .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#243:6>
One very interesting feature in HKU especially in the English
Department is that many Dr. learn to speak Cantonese .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#244:6>
In addition , I need to make new friends or else I will be lonely in
the university .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#245:6>
Although , I have already got some good friends in the university ,
usually my former classmates , they study different subjects and we have
little time to meet each other .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#246:6>
To solve the problem of feeling lonely , I make a lot of new friends
from different faculty , different departments and different backgrounds .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#247:6>
I got to know these people by joining the student bodies such as
societies and clubs .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#248:6>
In a way , meeting new friends widen my social life and I find it
very interesting to meet different kind of people in the university . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-009#249:6>
I know that there was an universal suffrage and I still don't
know what it is all about .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#250:6>
Can you tell me something about the vote ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-009#251:6>
My brother , starts his secondary life in Sept but he doesn't do
well in English dictation especially in times of unseen dictation .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#252:6>
I think it will be better for him to learn phonetics .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#253:6>
Nonetheless , I didn't know much about this subjects .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#254:6>
In the university I have to study phonetics but until now I am very
confused and I don't know how to write an essay on phonetics .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#255:6>
For my sister , she is busy with her tests and the public A-level
exam .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#256:6>
For my mum , she is putting on weight .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#257:6>
We have an old saying &ldquo; Getting fat in the middle ages &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#258:6>
Since my mum is in her middle ages , she is getting fatter than
before .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#259:6>
In the past she only got about 40kg but now she has got 46kg .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#260:6>
We all remind her to keep a watch on her weight as too fat is not so
good for her health . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#261:6>
It is already 1:30a.m .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#262:6>
I better stop here .

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#263:6>
Write soon !

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#264:6>
Love ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-009#265:6>
