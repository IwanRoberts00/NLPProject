Dear Mr. O'Hara , <h>

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#2:1>
<ul> RE : URBTIX TICKETING SYSTEM TO THE HONG KONG ARTS CENTRE </ul>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#3:1>
The agreement between the Urban Services Department &obrack; USD
&cbrack; and the Hong Kong Arts Centre &obrack; HKAC &cbrack; for the
provision of the Urbtix ticketing system to the HKAC is due to expire by the
end of June 1994 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#4:1>
The subject of renewal of the said agreement was discussed in the
37th meeting of the Board of Governors of the HKAC held on 6th June 1994 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#5:1>
As most of the HKAC project funds reply on sponsorship , sponsor for
free ticketing system to the HKAC as a project was suggested .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#6:1>
It was resolved that the Urban Council &obrack; UC &cbrack; should be
approached for this purpose as the UC has already been subsidizing the HKAC
in using the said ticketing system , the Board believes that an extension of
this subsidy should be acceptable to the UC as this would allow more funds to
be available to the HKAC in presenting more/better programmes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#7:1>
Your name was given by Mr. Paul Young , representative of the UC
in the HKAC Board of Governors for addressing the issue to the UC . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#8:1>
Based on the existing agreement for 1993/94 , the following table
prepared by the USD quantifies the contribution by both parties under the
existing arrangement . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#9:1>
<O> table of contributions </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#10:1>
In view of the above , assuming the number of tickets to be sold
for HKAC events by other Urbtix outlets remains unchanged , and based on the
proposed new rate from the USD @&dollar;3. per ticket , the total ticket
charge payable to the UC should become &dollar;131,694 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#11:1>
Adding in the monthly fixed charges for the equipment , the total
sponsorship that HKAC is looking from the UC for 1994/95 is estimated to be
around &dollar;320,000 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#12:1>
As there is a tendency that the number of tickets for HKAC events to
be sold in other Urbtix outlets is dropping , the increase of the UC
sponsorship per year to be HKAC should remain quite constant in the years to
come . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#13:1>
To furnish you with some background information , the Urbtix
ticketing system was introduced into the HKAC in October 1987 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#14:1>
The basic concept for the said introduction was to benefit the HKAC
the service of a sophisticated ticketing system which the HKAC could not
afford if it is to stand on its own .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#15:1>
In return , the HKAC would use its own staff resources to operate the
HKAC outlet as one of the Urbtix outlets and to assist in selling ticket
inventories for non-HKAC events .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#16:1>
Charge would only impose on tickets sold for the HKAC events in other
Urbtix outlets together with the leasing of the basic equipments . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#17:1>
Terms and conditions of the said agreement were modified upon
each renewal in every two years .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#18:1>
However , circumstances have been changed since the introduction of
the said system as the UC and Regional Council &obrack; RC &cbrack; venues
for performances have been increased considerably .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#19:1>
Total number of seats in performing venues available for booking
under the Urbtix System ranges from about 7,500 , 82,000 , 2,700 to 712 for
RC , UC , Academy of Performing Arts and HKAC respectively .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#20:1>
From these figures , one can visualize that the HKAC has to face
tremendous competition in the availability of cultural venues .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#21:1>
To survive needs reviewing of all revenues and expenses . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#22:1>
Total number of tickets sold for the HKAC events amounts to
124,836 in 93/94 of which 80,938 &obrack; 65&percent; &cbrack; were sold in
the HKAC and 43,898 &obrack; 35&percent; &cbrack; were sold in Urbtix outlets
which under the present arrangement would incur a charge to the HKAC . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#23:1>
Total number of tickets sold in the HKAC in 93/94 amounts to
171,486 of which 90,548 &obrack; 53&percent; &cbrack; tickets were for
non-HKAC events .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#24:1>
Growth rate for tickets of non-HKAC event goes as high as 60&percent;
between 92/93 to 93/94 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#25:1>
This implies that additional man power and thus costs are required ,
especially taking into consideration the fact that special arrangements have
to be made in selling tickets for pop concerts organized in the UC venues .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#26:1>
Unlike the Academy of Performing Arts and the RC , the HKAC has
to reply on its own resources .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#27:1>
Many times worthwhile programme were cancelled simply because of lack
of funds .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#28:1>
In view of this , the HKAC Board of Governors wishes to urge the UC
to seriously consider granting a free Urbtix ticketing system to the HKAC so
as to enable the HKAC to further develop the objectives as set in the
Government  ' s Hong Kong Arts Centre Ordinance . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#29:1>
Should you have any queries or require further information with
regard to the above , please give the undersigned a ring at 5820224 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#30:1>
As the present agreement is due to expiring on 30/6/94 , your urgent
attention and reply will be much appreciated . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#31:1>
Yours Sincerely ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#32:1>

<I>

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#39:2>
Dear Margaret ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#40:2>
This refers to your letter of 27th June 1994 and our subsequent
meeting .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#41:2>
I wish to congratulate you on your success in getting the Council  ' s
continuous support to ARIC but regret to hear that you will be leaving soon .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#42:2>
After seeing what you have been able to achieve , your departure will
definitely be a loss to ARIC . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#43:2>
Right from the conception stage , the Hong Kong Arts Centre has
been closely linked with ARIC .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#44:2>
We appreciate very much that ARIC , like ourselves , is a non-profit
making organization to provide services to the arts community of Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#45:2>
That explains why the Hong Kong Arts Centre has always been a keen
supporter to ARIC . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#46:2>
As you may well aware , the Hong Kong Arts Centre revenue relies
heavily on the hiring charges of the various performing/exhibition venues and
rental income from the office block .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#47:2>
Due to inadequacy of capital funds available for our building
maintenance , we are trying hard to maximize our revenue in all directions
and income from rental and venue hiring definitely has rooms for improvement .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#48:2>
The Customer Services Department who handles bookings , briefings ,
and complaints from our hirers of venues and the public needs an office which
is closer to the venues and the public in order to cater for the anticipated
increase of workload .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#49:2>
This is the rational behind the requested relocation as discussed in
our previous meeting . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#50:2>
Instead of exercising the planned relocation , to extend ARIC  ' s
tenancy on 1 April 1994 for six months at the present location and at a
reduced market rental has already been a reduced market rental has already
been a concession upon your request . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#51:2>
To enable ARIC to have more time to plan for its budget for
relocation , as a gesture of goodwill to support the arts community , the
Hong Kong Arts Centre once again agrees to extend ARIC  ' s existing tenancy at
similar terms for another six months up to 31st March 1995 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#52:2>
We hope you would appreciate that the above concessions are to a
certain extend at the expense of the Hong Kong Arts Centre which has to
survive on its own resources .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#53:2>
We do wish that you will convey this message to your successor , so
that he or she will include the said relocation in his/her planning . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#54:2>
Last but not least , I wish to thank you for a very enlightening
and enjoyable evening meeting and please do keep in touch . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#55:2>
Wishing you all the best in your new appointment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#64:3>
This refers to your letter of 4th August 1994 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#65:3>
All along Vivien Chan &ampersand; Co and especially Ms .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#66:3>
Vivien Chan had supported the Hong Kong Arts Centre tremendously
especially in terms of legal advice and committee works .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#67:3>
To this , on behalf of the Board and the various Committees of the
Hong Kong Arts Centre , we wish to extend our heartful thanks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#68:3>
We appreciate very much your kind gesture as to practically
donate your service rendered so far in respect of the captioned case by
charging us a nominal fee of approximately 10&percent; of the actual staff
costs incurred .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#69:3>
However , we regret to hear that you are no longer interested to
represent us further in this case after all your hard work in the last 4
years . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#70:3>
As you must be aware that the Hong Kong Arts Centre is a
non-profit making public organization relying on very limited funds to
promote and develop arts for the people of Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#71:3>
An unexpected donation of a property from Mr. Wang Si Chiu will
definitely be an asset to the Hong Kong Arts Centre as the revenue generated
from the property can be a good project funding after covering all expenses
concerned .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#72:3>
However , to incur huge legal costs in appointing another legal
advisor to further pursue the issue which to my present understanding is a
doubtful case is beyond what the Hong Kong Arts Centre can afford . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#73:3>
As your company has been representing us in this case for such a
long time and based on our long term relationship , we sincerely hope that
you can continue the service .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#74:3>
However , if you really have to insist on your decision , we wish
that you could do us a favour by informing the Probate Registry that there
are difficulties in locating the deceased  ' s wife and that the Arts Centre
would like to request the Probate Registry to use its discretion to decide if
the Arts Centre can get its representation or not . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#75:3>
If a negative reply is received from the Probate Registry , the
Board may consider the case closed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#76:3>
Your company has our sincere gratitude for all the services and
support rendered in the past years and your bill of &dollar;8,704.- will be
settled in due course . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#77:3>
Once again , many thanks and we look forward to hearing from you .

Dear Ms. McBride ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#84:4>
This refers to your letter of 25 July 1994 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#85:4>
I have to apologise for the delay of this reply as I have been away
from Hong Kong till 9 August 1994 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#86:4>
I believe Ms. Gipsy Ng our Membership Manager has cleared with

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#87:4>
As regard to the introductory card for HKAC members to the Art
club in London , I am afraid that this benefit to members had been suspended
sometime in the past .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#88:4>
I believe the suspension must be due to the indifference of members
to this benefit . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#89:4>
However if an introductory letter from us can serve the purpose ,
we are more than glad to do you this service .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#98:5>
Dear Sir Hotung ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#99:5>
In our recent applications of project and matching grants to the
Hong Kong Arts Development council &obrack; HKADC &cbrack; for the funding of
two performing arts projects of the Hong Kong Arts Centre &obrack; HKAC
&cbrack; , only 37.5&percent; and 62.5&percent; of the applied funding were
granted . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#100:5>
We fully realize that the newly established HKADC would have a
new set of criteria for the assessment of funding of projects .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#101:5>
In order to get the full support of the HKADC in HKAC  ' s application
especially for programmes/projects which cannot be self supporting through
box office income or commercial sponsorship , we consider it vital to bring
to the attention of the Council members the present business and financial
position of the HKAC . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#102:5>
The HKAC is the largest independent non-profit making arts
organization in Hong Kong , the objectives of which is governed by Government  ' s
Hong Kong Arts Centre Ordinance to develop arts in all forms and it is
recognised in the mission statement of the HKADC . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#103:5>
Due to the proliferation of art venues built by the Municipal
Councils , the HKAC no longer enjoys the unique status it had a decade ago .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#104:5>
To continue to play an important role in the arts , the HKAC has
identified that more emphasis should be put in supporting non-established
artistic endeavours and innovative projects and out reach programme . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#105:5>
The HKAC , through its own presentation or venue hiring , offers
a variety of art programmes/activities to the people of Hong Kong practically
in everyday of a year .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#106:5>
To maintain the above operation , the HKAC needs a budget of 37
million in the 94/95 financial year .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#107:5>
This budget is funded by income from rental , box office , venue
hiring , advertising , sponsorship and donation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#108:5>
In general , rental income from offices of art organizations or
commercial companies occupying half of the HKAC building supports salaries of
the HKAC staff and the routine maintenance costs of the 128,000 square foot
building .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#109:5>
The box office income together with commercial sponsorship cover the
programme  ' s production costs and their required publicity .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#110:5>
Venue hiring charges cover the general administration and operation
costs .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#111:5>
The surplus is to offset the capital maintenance expenditure of the
building . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#112:5>
The above arrangement enables the HKAC to operate on a self
financing situation without relying on any government subsidy in the past few
years .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#113:5>
However due to factors listed below , the HKAC is compelled to look
for other alternatives in order to maintain its standard of operation and
presentation without changing its original objectives . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#114:5>
1.

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#115:5>
To upkeep this 17 year old building , a budget of 25 million is
required for capital expenditure in the coming five years . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#116:5>
2.

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#117:5>
Due to economic recession back in home town or shifting of corporate
base to China , quite a number of HKAC  ' s usual commercial sponsors have
withdrawn their sponsorship to the HKAC programmes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#118:5>
3.

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#119:5>
To secure new commercial sponsors is very competitive as there are
plenty of applications for sponsorship from the Art Festivals , Art Clubs and
Municipal Council  ' s grand performances . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#120:5>
4.

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#121:5>
The HKAC  ' s repositioning by putting more emphasis in supporting
non-established artistic endeavours makes it more difficult for the HKAC to
secure commercial sponsors . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#122:5>
5.

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#123:5>
Over 50&percent; of HKAC  ' s funding comes from rental of the office
areas .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#124:5>
The property market  ' s downturn will put HKAC in a financial
difficult position . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#125:5>
The above indicates that the HKAC needs a big reserve for the
upkeep of the building and for contingencies .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#126:5>
In the long run , the rental income which fluctuates with the
property market may not be able to cover the inflation of the staff salaries .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#127:5>
It is especially so when the panoramic seaview of the offices is
blocked by high rises built in the new Wanchai seafront reclamation in the
imminent future . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#128:5>
Consolidation of expenses and maximization of revenue have been
exercised in all directions .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#129:5>
To avoid many worthwhile projects/programmes being curtailed due to
lack of sponsors/funding , resolution had been obtained from the Board of
Governors of the HKAC to apply for project funding from the newly established
HKADC . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#130:5>
In general , non-profit making Arts Centre around the world
cannot survive on its own but have to rely on subsidy and grants .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#131:5>
To maintain the objectives as laid down by the Government as an art
promoter , presenter and developer , the HKAC do need the full support of the
HKADC .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#132:5>
The curtail of venue costs from the budget of the HKAC programme
application because the HKAC owns the venue can , as explained in the above ,
put the financial position of the HKAC off the balance . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#133:5>
I hope the above has given the council and Committee members of
the HKADC a better understanding of the HKAC , accepting that it is unique
and different from the operation of other art bodies in Hong Kong and
subsequently special consideration should be given in the assessment of the
HKAC applications .

<ICE-HK:W1B-017#134:5>
If further elaboration of the above is required , I am ready to
attend any meeting so that I can explain in full . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-017#135:5>
Thank you for your attention to the above . </p>
