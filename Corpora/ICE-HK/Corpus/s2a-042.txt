<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-042#1:1:A>
E-commerce will have the best potential because <,> of the fact
e-commerce <,> in China doesn't have any competing channels <,> like United
<.> na </.> United Airline in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#2:1:A>
You wanna try try marketing you know <,> e-commerce are winners

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#3:1:A>
So whoever book the airlined on the <.> w </.> web would save money
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#4:1:A>
The result is <,> fifteen <.> e </.> effort uh traveling agents in
Hong Kong <?> wallop </?> all United Airlines

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#5:1:A>
They don't sell on the net <,> okay because in tradition channels is
that <?> they  ' re </?> kicking us away <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#6:1:A>
But in China you don't because the traditional channels so weak <,>
so in a way <,> from that angle e-commerce may have a better potential <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#7:1:A>
China  ' s over-research and misunderstood <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#8:1:A>
We use a paradigm <,> very much <,> from the west <,> and everybody
rushing in and saying that where does the e-com coming from

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#9:1:A>
Everybody so poor

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#10:1:A>
Why could they afford <,> all these <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#11:1:A>
Or on the other hand is like <,> <unc> several words </unc>
more I mean uh western kind of style is that <,> why would Chinese <,>
consumers buy local Chinese products <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#12:1:A>
We couldn't understand it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#13:1:A>
Uh global product uhm definitely much better

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#14:1:A>
So so a lot of times we are observing fact that there are like uh
situation of pockets whereby <,> uh the Chinese consumers is definite over-
research <,> but definitely not understood in right way <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#15:1:A>
Mirage and reality <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#16:1:A>
About two years ago I give that talk and uh <,> among the audience
is a general <?> motor son </?> <,> senior managers

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#17:1:A>
He ask me is that uh would China become the largest private car
markets in the world <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#18:1:A>
Then I said uh let me answer your question with another question
<,> if you have only money to buy other apartment home or car <,> which one
would you go for <,> which one do you think the Chinese would go for

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#19:1:A>
Now if you are coming from Silicon Valley in California that the
answer is very obvious <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#20:1:A>
You buy a car <,> that you sleep there

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#21:1:A>
Uh in Silicon Valley it  ' s so <?> expensive anyway </?> so so you  ' ll
do that <,> but in China it  ' s the other way round <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#22:1:A>
So I said I mean you ask me about it the car market I think you
have to wait <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#23:1:A>
It  ' s an escalation growth that is going on <,> and finally it  ' s a
reverse quality gap

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#24:1:A>
Uh it  ' s in a way the quality gap come up with <,> the major <,>
premise is saying that well uh we produce something <,> and then the
consumers expect something higher therefore we got a quality gap

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#25:1:A>
In China <,> for the multi-nationals it  ' s almost the reverse

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#26:1:A>
The Chinese <,> may not be able to appreciate the quality <,> that
is in the product themselves <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#27:1:A>
So we  ' ll we  ' ll talk about that

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#28:1:A>
Now instead of going <unc> several words </unc> what I  ' m
trying to do is I will try to <.> f </.> focus on three things <,> maybe link
more to what we are talking about today <,> and I  ' ll also select all three
of them in a different perspective <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#29:1:A>
Hopefully <,> I mean does stimulating more discussion around here
<,> one is I  ' ll <,> look at the consumer <,> underlying motivations <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#30:1:A>
Okay we cannot <,> when we study culture we cannot throw away <,>
the baby <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#31:1:A>
That  ' s the baby

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#32:1:A>
The consumers are the baby

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#33:1:A>
<?> We have the </?> underlying motivation <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#34:1:A>
And second I  ' ll move on to <,> one of the actors in the field <,>
the local <.> ch </.> uh Chinese <,> uh firms

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#35:1:A>
So in here I  ' ll <,> uh <unc> several words </unc> and talk
about hot consumption spot as arena traps <,> and then the growth of Chinese
local brands

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#36:1:A>
And then I will talk about another side <,> of the fence that is
multi-nationals <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#37:1:A>
Uh what do they see and what do they do not see <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#38:1:A>
Uh by the way <,> uh uh am I am I am I doing okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#39:1:A>
You can hear me

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#40:1:A>
Okay fine

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#41:1:A>
Uh any question you <.> s </.> <?> subscribe </?> <unc> one
word </unc> please <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#42:1:A>
So I take these three perspective and hopefully also three actors
<,> coming in and so on so <.> s </.> <,> the rest of it <unc> several
words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#43:1:A>
Now <,> I think the <.> mo </.> <?> major </?> uh underlying
motivation for many Chinese is this <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#44:1:A>
Their income is low <,> their expenditure definitely go along with
it so it  ' s gonna be bearable <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#45:1:A>
They could only afford a very humble lifestyle <,,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#46:1:A>
But with all <,> just like <,> what we discuss about advertising
about consumption about seeing <,> how uhm <,> uh <,> other people spend
their money <,> they aspire a much higher lifestyle beyond their reach <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#47:1:A>
For many Chinese the best <?> thing </?> <,> uh the question that
they have <,> whenever they do the consumption <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#48:1:A>
Now then the question is that <,> how could they live beyond the
means

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#49:1:A>
A very interesting one <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#50:1:A>
Do they stop there

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#51:1:A>
Do they just <,> being affordable and then stay on there

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#52:1:A>
No <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#53:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#54:1:A>
They will try to <,> go on to the aspired lifestyle code <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#55:1:A>
Now on the other hand <,> then how could they afford it <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#56:1:A>
Then <&> cough </&> my colleague and I <,> come out with a <?> main
look </?> <,> some sort of uh eight ways <,> that they can do <,> luxury <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#57:1:A>
Uhm <,> some of <?> them </?> actually <,> <&> cough </&> propose
and observe <?> bank </?> in <.> e </.> East-European countries <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#58:1:A>
One is like <,> prolonging luxury <,> okay <,> that is <,> once you
acquire a particular product <,> you want to extend it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#59:1:A>
You take extra care of it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#60:1:A>
Uh I guess uh around here if you you you you first have your <,>
most nice pair of shoes <,> okay you take extra extra care of it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#61:1:A>
That  ' s a same kind philosophy <,> philosophy <,> and uhm <,>
people actually also <,,> compare the study <,> in uhm <,> McDonalds in China
versus McDonald in United States <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#62:1:A>
Uh consumers in China stays in McDonald three times longer <,> than
a typical American <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#63:1:A>
They go longer <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#64:1:A>
I mean <,> they claim to go to McDonald <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#65:1:A>
It  ' s McDonald they know its fast food <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#66:1:A>
They thought this <,> and they would in the in the mind and said
<.> no </.> not a fast food to me it  ' s something more so I would stay on

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#67:1:A>
So it  ' s prolonging the luxury <,> inspecting <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#68:1:A>
Another one example would be sharing luxury <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#69:1:A>
They would they wouldn't mind <,> when they travel together <,> two
people stay in a five star hotel then <,> each one have a three star hotel
room <,,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#70:1:A>
To put the resources together <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#71:1:A>
That  ' s understandable <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#72:1:A>
We understand it

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#73:1:A>
When I was a kid there was like uh <,> at that time family is a <&>
cough </&> <,> uh it  ' s <.> s </.> poor <,> and uh <.> re </.> <.> re </.> I
<.> re </.> I still remember that that uh <,> even <.> ici </.> uh <,> uh
icicle or <.> i </.> popsicle you can split it into two <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#74:1:A>
They made it in a way you can break it <,> so you share it

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#75:1:A>
So sharing luxury a lot of times is <,> what happening <,> uh so
that they can enjoy a different lifestyle <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#76:1:A>
Another one is <,> democratizing <?> luxury </?> <,> using <,>
cheap <,> substitutes <,> like cheap champagnes <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#77:1:A>
There  ' re lots of them <,> in China <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#78:1:A>
It  ' s is is a brand coming up <,> or <unc> one word </unc>
coming up they could not afford the normal one <,> they go for the cheap one
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#79:1:A>
Uh so so that  ' s another way that we look at it <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#80:1:A>
And <?> that one </?> is almost like leaping luxury

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#81:1:A>
Uhm the idea comes from the fact that the Maslow has a very nice
<,> linear <,> dependency model

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#82:1:A>
You get the survivors <,,> and then you socialize you get actualize
and <,> whatever it is <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#83:1:A>
Uh but you look at that to be <unc> two words </unc> <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#84:1:A>
Uh they may look <.> n </.> nice but they go hungry <,> and then
there is uhm <,> I think uhm <,,> a <?> play </?> somewhere in East uh Europe

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#85:1:A>
They are saying that is is the the the the the title of the play  ' s
Overcoat

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#86:1:A>
There  ' s somebody actually selling off everything in order to
protect his overcoat not being <,> sold

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#87:1:A>
Uh under that circumstances that that poor guy actually <,> uh
fainting on the street or some <.> sor </.> some sort of die in the end

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#88:1:A>
But then <,> they want to look nice

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#89:1:A>
I mean for them is leaping ahead

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#90:1:A>
Uh it  ' s unfortunately is looking more materialistic but
nonetheless <,> that  ' s the reality

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#91:1:A>
So we are talking about <,> in some senses many of them many of the
Chinese people they trade off some <?> of the </?> necessities <,> for
something that they can actualize or they can associate with the social
status <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#92:1:A>
Another one going along is privatizing luxury <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#93:1:A>
They use <,> private vans <,> local bike vans <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#94:1:A>
So in Shengzhen right now or Guangzhou you can buy all of these
vans and so on anything you want <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#95:1:A>
You want this shirt look like a Nike one or <,> uh uhm uh <,> uh
<unc> two words </unc> you just buy the brand and stick it on

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#96:1:A>
That  ' s fine

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#97:1:A>
Uh then you go to like uh private labels I mean many of them <.> s
</.> so those uh look-alike vans have a lot of uh uh customers for that
reason

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#98:1:A>
Even though the customs continue to crack down <,> or the
intellectual property right <,> continue to do so as well <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#99:1:A>
Another one is escalating luxury <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#100:1:A>
Right if they are in that particular level <,> and then they need
a much higher level to go into <,> just like <,> when they are riding bike
<,> you  ' re asking them to sell them <,> an apartment  ' s worth <,> of a car
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#101:1:A>
Now that  ' s that  ' s that  ' s quite a big jump <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#102:1:A>
So where where where somewhere in-between <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#103:1:A>
Well the somewhere in-between would be mopeds <,,> motor cycles
scooters and so on <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#104:1:A>
So if now you travel in China <,> about thirty percent <,> in the
cities <,> are replacing the motorbike uh the bicycle with motorbikes <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#105:1:A>
It  ' s no kidding <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#106:1:A>
When I go up into Guangzhou now <,> from nine to five <,> no
motorcycle in the city <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#107:1:A>
<?> The respect </?> <,> there are so many of <?> them </?> <,>
there is the there is uh escalating the curve well escalating first <,>
motorcycle <,> and then maybe the bike <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#108:1:A>
And of course that curve is also changing too <,> because that
back in home right now in China I spend much more expensive than ever before

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#109:1:A>
So they move up the curve <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#110:1:A>
I  ' ll I  ' ll from the affordable to to the less affordable kind of
area <,> when the cars are moving down <,> the dropping price by thirty <,>
to sometimes forty percent <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#111:1:A>
So <,> if you ask me the same question now right now is the saying
that <,> would China become the uh world  ' s uh largest private car market <,>
I would say it depends on the price <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#112:1:A>
If you continue to escalate downwards <,> there would be a point
<,> where a lot of people would be buying cars <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#113:1:A>
And of course <,> the service station many other things have to
come along with it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#114:1:A>
Now that  ' s the <.> e </.> escalating luxury and the last one is
glimpsing luxury <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#115:1:A>
It  ' s that they wouldn't have time to do it all the time <,> but
on the other hand they do it once in a while <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#116:1:A>
So it  ' s <,> when I talk to the Heineken <,> uh <,> manager she is
saying that <,> only if it is <.> ju </.> like <,> one of twenty beers is
Heineken is fine <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#117:1:A>
It  ' s a good market point <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#118:1:A>
They could not demand that every time they go to a <,> a bar or
have a drink outside they would go for Heineken

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#119:1:A>
It  ' s it  ' s it  ' s ridiculous <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#120:1:A>
But nonetheless <,> one in twenty is not too bad <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#121:1:A>
So that  ' s the <,> some of the <,> motivation behind it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#122:1:A>
Now <,> what about the firms uhm <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#123:1:A>
How am I doing on the timing

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#124:1:A>
How much time <unc> several words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#125:1:A>
Okay okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#126:1:A>
Just buzz me if I am going over okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#127:1:A>
Now <,> <&> cough </&> what about the firm  ' s strategies

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#128:1:A>
Now the firm  ' s strategy is a very interesting one <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#129:1:A>
Here <,> likes an example of value engineering <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#130:1:A>
Now what is what engineering is this <,> in order to create more
value for the customer <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#131:1:A>
Now so they <,> they are looking for prolonging the luxury right
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#132:1:A>
They want to stay longer <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#133:1:A>
So you want to stretch it out longer for them

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#134:1:A>
That  ' s what <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#135:1:A>
So that  ' s what we call in marketing value engineering <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#136:1:A>
Engineering more things <,> of value to the customers <,> itself
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#137:1:A>
Now the other one is sharing luxury

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#138:1:A>
Remember breaking the <,> ice popsicle <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#139:1:A>
We we package apart <,> cut it smaller <,> smaller size so that
they can <,> take it on their own <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#140:1:A>
Democratic <,> democratizing luxury <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#141:1:A>
One way is sub-brand <,> so instead of just selling at that level
<,> going down the curve <,> going down the curve <,> because they are
looking for cheaper products <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#142:1:A>
So you have to go down <?> your </?> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#143:1:A>
Now another one is very interesting value engineering gain <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#144:1:A>
Uhm <,> in marketing we always call something as a core product
<,> like a cup of coffee <,> the coffee would be the core product <,> and
then <.> yo </.> the cup itself <,> is a peripheral <,> and then <.> de </.>
<.> de </.> design the cup is another peripheral and then the stirrer is
another peripheral

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#145:1:A>
Uhm things are on top of it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#146:1:A>
We in <,> in a way is looking at it is by increasing or <.> e </.>
<,> expanding the core with peripherals <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#147:1:A>
We  ' re actually <,> we help the values up <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#148:1:A>
Now that was <,> in a developed economy <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#149:1:A>
Now once you have this huge product <,> with the core and <.> wi
</.> on all the peripherals you stuck it into an emerging market like
mainland China <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#150:1:A>
The other way round would be <,> you unfold it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#151:1:A>
You take off the peripherals <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#152:1:A>
They don't need it <,,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#153:1:A>
For example <,> how many of you in the room knows one hundred
percent <,> all the function of VCR <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#154:1:A>
I don't <,,> okay <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#155:1:A>
Now so so in a way it  ' s decomposing it <,> take it off

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#156:1:A>
I mean some of things are are not useful <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#157:1:A>
I mean the packaging we did it in beautiful packaging <,> but in
mainland China they don't care about packaging <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#158:1:A>
They just want the product <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#159:1:A>
You do it in a delivery way

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#160:1:A>
They said no no no no I can ride my bike <,> and took home <,> my
TV <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#161:1:A>
So you don't deliver it to me I took it off <,,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#162:1:A>
So all of a sudden we are talking about a very interesting <.> phe
</.> uh phenomenon

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#163:1:A>
It  ' s called naked product <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#164:1:A>
You take it all those things take it off <,> become a naked
product approach <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#165:1:A>
So there would be something that <,> democratizing <,,> in order
if somebody is trying to democratizing you want to hit them back with lower
price <,> appropriate product you are redesigning the whole uh price
attribute model <,> in terms of value engineering <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#166:1:A>
Now what about <.> lux </.> leaping luxury

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#167:1:A>
Again the same thing <,> and of course we also hit with uh a major
<,,> moral issue whether we are ethical or not <,,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#168:1:A>
Uh say for example Coca Cola and Pepsi has always been hit with
this <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#169:1:A>
In the developing countries they are selling nothing <,> but some
unhealthy <,> like uh <,> uh <,> elements <?> put </?> in <.> t </.> water
<,> and then replacing some of the nutritions uh kind of drinks and so on

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#170:1:A>
I mean there  ' s marketing uh of that uh ethics and so on

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#171:1:A>
But of course many people say <,> uh there is lot of power behind
the whole thing <,> and how would you feel <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#172:1:A>
Uh remember <?> I saw </?> a uh an interview with the CEO <,> and
said <,> how do you feel that <,> so much <,> power so much <,> resources so
much <,> energy put in <,> just a simple product <,> as coke <,,> and the
answer is <,> how wonderful is that <,,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#173:1:A>
So it  ' s ethical issue coming in

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#174:1:A>
Remember us <,> we are <?> leaping </?> luxury <,> and that
whether we are <,> moving people around on that basis

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#175:1:A>
Privatizing luxury <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#176:1:A>
Now you are looking at that <,> then the factory outlet and
sub-branding make sense <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#177:1:A>
Now if you are <,> people are privatizing is that they could not
afford it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#178:1:A>
They honestly could not afford <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-042#179:1:A>
Then why don't you sell them <,> at the factory outlet of the B
grade product that is the product that do not need the one hundred <,>
quality <,> control level <,> and they would be <,> your customers in the
future <,> </I>
