<ICE-HK:W2A-028#3:1>
Western guidelines have been used to diagnose diabetes mellitus in
Asia .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#4:1>
The increased availability of data from Asian populations , however ,
has made it apparent that modifications to western guidelines are needed when
they are used in Asia .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#5:1>
Both the American Diabetes Association and the World Health
Organization have recently modified their diagnostic criteria for diabetes
mellitus .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#6:1>
The implications of these new criteria in Asia are discussed in this
paper .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#7:1>
The significance of using fasting plasma glucose measurements and/or
oral glucose tolerance tests in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is
analysed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#8:1>
A simple approach to diagnose diabetes mellitus in the Hong Kong
Chinese population is also suggested . </bold> </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#9:1>
Introduction </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-028#10:1>
Diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous metabolic syndrome that is
characterised by chronic hyperglycaemia due to insulin resistance , insulin
insufficiency , or both .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#11:1>
With a better understanding of the pathophysiology and regulation of
glucose metabolism , new classifications of diabetes based on aetiologies &obrack; 
Box 1 &cbrack; and clinical staging &obrack;  Fig &cbrack; have been recommended by the World Health
Organization &obrack;  WHO &cbrack; and the American Diabetes Association &obrack;  ADA). <sp> 1,2
</sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#12:1>
In particular , the previous classification of insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus have now been
replaced by type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus , respectively , because of
the considerable overlap in the clinical stages between the two types of
diabetes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#13:1>
In clinical practice , the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus remains
largely a clinical one and relies mainly on the measurement of plasma glucose
( PG &cbrack; levels with or without the presence of hyperglycaemic symptoms . </p>
<h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#14:1>
The gold standard </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-028#15:1>
In 1985 , the WHO recommended the use of either a fasting PG
concentration of = 7.8 mmol/L &obrack;  140 mg/dL &cbrack; and/or a 2-hour post-glucose
loading PG &obrack;  or random PG &cbrack; concentration of = 11.1 mmol/L &obrack;  200 mg/dL &cbrack; as
diagnostic criteria. <sp> 3 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#16:1>
In asymptomatic subjects , the test is repeated to confirm the
diagnosis .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#17:1>
Up to 1996 , the ADA adopted similar diagnostic criteria. <sp> 4
</sp> </p> <O> Table </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-028#18:1>
The 2-hour PG cut-off value of 11.1 mmol/L remains the gold
standard because of its pathophysiological significance .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#19:1>
In prospective studies , diabetes retino-pathy was found in patients
whose 2-hour PG level was = 11.1 mmol/L. <sp> 5,6 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#20:1>
There is also evidence that 11.1 mmol/L is the 2-hour PG level at
which insulin secretion from pancreatic ß cells starts to decline. <sp> 7,8
</sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#21:1>
On the other hand , the fasting PG cut-off value of <O> Figure </O>
7.8 mmol/L has been more arbitrarily defined .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#22:1>
The threshold was based mainly on the finding that more than
90&percent; of subjects who had a fasting PG level of = 7.8 mmol/L would be
classified as having diabetes mellitus according to the 2-hour PG level if a
subsequent oral glucose tolerance test &obrack;  OGTT &cbrack; were performed. <sp> 9 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#23:1>
However , subjects who have a fasting PG level of
<7.8 mmol/L would not necessarily  have a 2-hour PG level of <11.1 mmol/L .  

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#24:1>
In fact , there is now abundant evidence that confirms the poor
sensitivity of using a fasting PG cut-off value of 7.8 mmol/L to diagnose
diabetes , as based on a 2-hout PG cut-off value of 11.1 mmol/L. <sp> 10,11
</sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#25:1>
To achieve an optimal balance between the sensitivity and specificity
of this method of diagnosing diabetes , a lower fasting PG value , ranging
from 5.3 to 7.1 mmol/L , has been suggested for use in different ethnic
groups. <sp> 12-14 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#26:1>
In the Hong Kong Chinese population , the fasting PG cut-off value
that corresponds to a 2-hour PG level of 11.1 mmol/L is between 5.5 and 5.8
mmol/L. <sp> 15,16 </sp> </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#27:1>
New diagnostic criteria </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-028#28:1>
In 1997 , the ADA modified their diagnostic criteria by reducing
the fasting PG cut-off value from 7.8 to 7.0 mmol/L &obrack;  126 mg/dL &cbrack; , while
keeping the 2-hour &obrack;  or random &cbrack; PG cut-off value the same &obrack;  ie 11.1 mmol/L).
<sp> 1 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#29:1>
The diagnosis needs to be confirmed by repeating the test on a
different day; however , the OGTT is discouraging for routine clinical use .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#30:1>
In epidemiological studies , one fasting PG measurement will suffice.
<sp> 1 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#31:1>
In 1988 , the WHO proposed similar modifications to the diagnostic
cut-off levels. <sp> 2 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#32:1>
The WHO reserved the use of fasting PG or 2-hour PG measurements for
epidemiological purposes and suggested that ideally , both values should be
used .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#33:1>
The revised criteria are summarized in Table 1 . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#34:1>
New intermediate group </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-028#35:1>
The fasting PG cut-off level of 7.0 mmol/L was chosen because of
its strong association with the <O> Table </O> development of retinopathy ,
coronary artery disease , and its correspondence to a 2-hour PG measurement
of 11.1 mmol/L. <sp> 1 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#36:1>
The PG level , however , should be viewed as a continuum regarding
its relationships with cardiovascular risks .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#37:1>
In non-diabetes Hong Kong Chinese subjects &obrack;  based on the 1985 WHO
diagnostic criteria of a fasting PG , <7.8 mmol/L and a 2-year PG ,  
<11.1 mmol/L &cbrack; , we have previously found  that subjects with a fasting PG
level of 5.7 to 7.8 mmol/L , when compared with those with a fasting PG level
of less than 5.7 mmol/L , have significantly higher systolic blood pressure ,
body mass indices , waist to hip ratios , glycated haemoglobin &obrack;  HbA <sb> 1c
</sb>  &cbrack; levels , insulin levels , and adverse lipid profiles. <sp> 16 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#38:1>
Similarly , in Chinese people with normal glucose tolerance &obrack;  based
on the 1985 WHO criteria of both fasting PG and a 2-hour PG ,
<7.8 mmol/L &cbrack; , increasing HbA  <sb> 1c </sb> tertiles have been shown to be
associated with increasing blood pressure , waist to hip ratios , PG ,
insulin levels , and adverse lipid profiles. <sp> 17 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-028#39:1>
Three major population-based studies have shown that there is a
clear relationship between the degree of glycaemia and the mortality rate ,
even among subjects with normal glucose tolerance , as analysed by tertiles
or quartiles of fasting blood glucose. <sp> 18-20 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#40:1>
In accordance with the idea that the relationship between the PG and
increased morbidity and morality is continuous , both the ADA and WHO have
suggested a new intermediate group based on the fasting PG level. <sp> 1,2
</sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#41:1>
People who have a fasting PG level of 6.1 to 7.0 mmol/L &obrack;  110-126
mg/dL &cbrack; are considered to have impaired fasting glucose &obrack;  IFG &cbrack; by the ADA or
impaired fasting glycaemia by the WHO .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#42:1>
In contrast , people whose fasting PG level is
<6.1 mmol/L  are considered to have norma l fasting glucose &obrack;  NFG &cbrack; &obrack;  Table 1 &cbrack; .
</p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#43:1>
Oral glucose tolerance tests </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-028#44:1>
The OGTT is usually performed for those who have borderline PG
levels &obrack;  either fasting or random &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#45:1>
It has also been suggested as the screening test for high-risk
subjects such as those with impaired glucose tolerance &obrack;  UGT &cbrack; , a family
history of diabetes , obesity , or hypertension. <sp> 21 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#46:1>
However , the OGTT has long been criticized because of its
inconvenience to patients , high costs , and poor reproducibility. <sp> 22
</sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#47:1>
In Hong Kong Chinese patients , we have previously found that the
reproducibility of the OGTT is only 66&percent;. <sp> 23 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#48:1>
This result did not improve even among subjects with risk factors for
glucose intolerance such as those having a high level of HbA <sb> 1c </sb> or
obesity .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#49:1>
The ADA has discouraged the use of the OGTT in its revised diagnostic
criteria. <sp> 1 <sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#50:1>
If the OGTT is indicated , however , the previous 2-hour PG cut-off
levels are still applicable , such that subjects with a fasting PG level of
<0.7 mmol/L and a 2-hour PG level of 7.8  to 11.1 mmol/L are considered to
have IGT. <sp> 1,2 </sp> </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#51:1>
The implications of using the new diagnostic criteria in the Asian
population </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-028#52:1>
In 1993 , Cockram et al <sp> 24 </sp> reported the crude
prevalence of diabetes mellitus in the Hong Kong Chinese population to be
4.6&percent; , based on a survey of 1513 adults of working ages .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#53:1>
Of the cases of diabetes mellitus , 61.8&percent; had been
undiagnosed previously .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#54:1>
After excluding known cases , the prevalence of diabetes mellitus was
calculated to be 2.83&percent; , using the 1985 WHO criteria. <sp> 25 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#55:1>
If the 1997 ADA criteria &obrack;  fasting PG , = 7.0 mmol/L; no 2-hour PG
measurement &cbrack; were applied to the same group of adults , the prevalence of
diabetes was calculated to be 1.41&percent;: a net reduction of
1.42&percent;. <sp> 25 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#56:1>
This difference was accounted for by the  ' loss ' of 1.95&percent; of
people with a fasting PG level of <7.0 mmol/L , but with a 2-hour  PG level
of = 11.1 mmol/L .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#57:1>
However , the loss was partially compensated by an increase of
0.54&percent; of people whose fasting PG level was 7 to 7.8 mmol/L and 2-hour
PG was less than 11.1 mmol/L .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#58:1>
This group had diabetes mellitus according to the new criteria but
not the old ones. <sp> 25 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#59:1>
If the 2-hour PG measurement were also taken into account &obrack;  using the
1998 WHO criteria &cbrack; , the  ' new ' prevalence of diabetes would then be
3.37&percent;: a net increase of 0.54&percent; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#60:1>
Similarly , in Japan , the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus of
13.3&percent; consists of only 7.8&percent; of people in whom the disease was
diagnosed , based on a fasting PG cut-off level of = 7.0 mmol/L .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#61:1>
The remaining 5.5&percent; of subjects has a fasting PG level of
<7.0 mmol/L and the diagnosis was based o n the 2-hour PG level = 11.1 mmol/L
( Sasaki A , unpublished data , 1999 &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-028#62:1>
A reanalysis of European epidemiological data from 26 190
subjects showed that the difference in prevalence of diabetes mellitus using
the ADA criteria &obrack;  fasting PG , = 7 mmol/L &cbrack; and WHO criteria &obrack;  2-hour PG , =
11.1 mmol/L &cbrack; ranged from -4.0&percent; to +13.2&percent; and that the
overall difference was +0.5&percent;. <sp> 26 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#63:1>
Only 28&percent; of the 1517 diabetes patients were classified as
having diabetes mellitus according to both criteria .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#64:1>
Interestingly , the WHO and ADA criteria were more likely to diagnose
diabetes in lean individuals , and middle-aged obese individuals ,
respectively. <sp> 26 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-028#65:1>
Despite its low sensitivity of diagnosing diabetes mellitus ,
using a fasting PG measurement is a more reproducible test when used in the
Hong Kong Chinese population .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#66:1>
Based on the measurements of the fasting PG level on two occasions
within 6 weeks , the diagnoses &obrack;  diabetes , IFG , or NFG &cbrack; were highly
consistent , with an overall reproducibility of 90.8&percent;. <sp> 25 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#67:1>
In addition , patients who were classified as having diabetes
mellitus according to the new criteria had higher HbA <sb> 1c </sb> and
fructosamine levels than did diabetic patients whose disease was diagnosed by
using the old criteria. <sp> 25 </sp> </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#68:1>
Missed glucose intolerance </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-028#69:1>
Based on the available epidemiological data , it is essential to
reduce the fasting PG cut-off value .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#70:1>
Using the fasting PG level alone to diagnose diabetes mellitus is
more convenient and the result is more reproducible .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#71:1>
The omission of the 2-hour PG measurement , however , will fail to
identity subjects who would have glucose , intolerance &obrack;  ie IGT &cbrack; or diabetes
mellitus as defined by the 2-hour PG measurement .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#72:1>
Furthermore , if the OGTT is subsequently performed in individuals
who have a fasting PG level below 7.0 mmol/L , a proportion of them will be
found to have IGT or diabetes mellitus .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#73:1>
This group is referred to as having  ' missed glucose intolerance ' &obrack; 
MGI &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-028#74:1>
In a previous survey , 10&percent; to 30&percent; of 1513 Hong
Kong Chinese individuals were found to have MGI &obrack;  ie a normal fasting PG but
an abnormal 2-hour PG &cbrack; depending on the presence or absence of risk factors
for glucose intolerance &obrack;  unpublished data , 1999 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#75:1>
The diagnosis of IGT cannot be made without performing an OGTT .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#76:1>
Studies have confirmed the adverse relationship between IGT and
cardiovascular disease. <sp> 27 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#77:1>
In addition , we have previously shown that 11.5&percent; of cases of
IGT progress to diabetes mellitus each year in the Hong Kong Chinese
population. <sp> 28 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#78:1>
This conversion rate is one of the highest reported among different
ethnic populations and is lower than the rate of 15.7&percent; per year
reported by Pan et al in the Da Qing Study , which involved the Chinese
population in northern China. <sp> 29 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-028#79:1>
To minimise missing the diagnosis of diabetes or IGT , we have
attempted to identify the characteristics of individuals with MGI .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#80:1>
In a local study of Chinese individuals with no history of diabetes,
<sp> 25 </sp> OGTTs were performed in those with IFG and those with risk
factors for glucose intolerance such as hypertension and obesity .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#81:1>
In this way , more than half of those tested were found to have MGI.
<sp> 25 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#82:1>
Hence , if the OGTT were performed in high-risk individuals &obrack; 
approximately 20&percent; of the population &cbrack; , approximately 70&percent; of
the MGI cases would be identified &obrack;  unpublished data , 1999 &cbrack; . </p> <h>
<bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#83:1>
Guidelines for diagnosing and classifying glucose intolerance in Asia
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-028#84:1>
The Japanese Diabetes Association &obrack;  JDA &cbrack; has recently recommended
a set of criteria to definite glucose intolerance and to diagnose diabetes
mellitus &obrack;  Box 2). <sp> 30 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#85:1>
Most of the recommendations from the JDA are applicable to Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#86:1>
However , using an optimal HbA <sb> 1c </sb> cut-off level to screen
or diagnose diabetes is still controversial and the measurement of the HbA
<sb> 1c </sb> level in Hong Kong has not been standardised .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#87:1>
On the other hand , the creation of additional terms such as  ' borderline'
glucose intolerance may create further confusion , because this group
includes subjects with IFG and/or IGT . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-028#88:1>
Recently , the Asian-Pacific Type 2 Diabetes Group recommended
the use of the new WHO and ADA diagnostic criteria to diagnose diabetes
mellitus and emphasised that a casual glucose measurement cannot be used to
diagnose IGT or IFG. <sp> 31 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#89:1>
The diagnosis of diabetes should always be confirmed by repeating the
test on another day , unless there is unequivocal hyperglycaemia with acute
metabolic decompensation or other obvious symptoms .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#90:1>
To reduce the number of cases of missed diagnosis owing to the
omission of 2-hour PG measurements , performing an OGTT is recommended for
people who have high normal fasting or random glucose levels .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#91:1>
These values are arbitrarily taken as a fasting PG level of 5.6 to
6.9 mmol/L or a random PG level of 6.5 to 11.0 mmol/L. <sp> 31 </sp> </p> <h>
<bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#92:1>
Glycated haemoglobin levels </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-028#93:1>
In the Hong Kong Chinese population , using paired values of the
fasting PG level and HbA <sb> 1c </sb> , level allows <O> Table </O> the
identification of people in whom diabetes mellitus has a high likelihood of
developing. <sp> 32-34 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#94:1>
The likelihood ratio of having diabetes in people whose fasting PG
level is = 5.6 mmol/L and HbA <sb> 1c </sb> level is = 5.5&percent; has been
shown to be 5.36 , compared with a value of only 0.10 in people with a
fasting PG level of <5.6  mmol/L and HbA  <sb> 1c </sb> level of
<5.5&percent;.  <sp> 32 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#95:1>
If these paired values were increased to 6.1 mmol/L and 6.1&percent;
, the likelihood ratio of having diabetes increases further , to 17.2. <sp>
33 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#96:1>
If fasting PG and HbA <sb> measurements are used as initial screening
tests and if an OGTT is performed only in those with a high likelihood ratio
to confirm their glycaemic status , more than 80&percent; of OGTT will be
unnecessary .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#97:1>
In a Japanese study , the HbA <sb> 1c </sb> measurement was available
in 54&percent; of a random sample of 10 865 adults older than 20 years .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#98:1>
Using fasting PG and 2-hour post-glucose loading PG measurements as
reference tests , 13.6&percent; of men in their 50s and 17.3&percent; of
women in their 60s were considered to have a high likelihood of having
diabetes if the HbA <sb> 1c </sb> level was 6.1&percent; or higher. <sp> 35
</sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-028#99:1>
Although there is enough evidence to support the use of the HbA
<sb> 1c </sb> measurement as an alternative or adjunct investigation to the
PG measurement , it should be used only as a screening test for diabetes.
<sp> 36 <sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#100:1>
Measuring the HbA <sb> 1c </sb> level is insufficiently sensitive as
a direct substitute for the OGTT .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#101:1>
In addition , the high cost and lack of laboratory standardisation
of HbA <sb> 1c </sb> measurement have so far limited its use in the diagnosis
of glucose intolerance . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#102:1>
Diagnosing diabetes mellitus in the Hong Kong Chinese population
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-028#103:1>
Based on the current literature , we propose that in symptomatic
patients , a fasting PG or random PG measurement can be used to diagnose
diabetes mellitus using the new ADA and WHO criteria .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#104:1>
A second measurement on a separate day is required to confirm the
diagnosis before clinical management is started .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#105:1>
In epidemiological surveys , either a fasting PG or 2-hour PG
measurement after a 75-g OGTT can be used .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#106:1>
To screen individuals without risk factors for glucose intolerance ,
a fasting PG measurement will be the first choice of test .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#107:1>
In those with risk factors for glucose intolerance , such as a
family history of diabetes , history of gestational diabetes , obesity , or
hypertension , an OGTT or a single blood test to determine fasting PG and HbA
<sb> 1c </sb> levels should be performed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#108:1>
The choice between the use of an OGTT or measuring the fasting PG
and HbA <sb> 1c </sb> levels will depend on the patient  ' s preference and the
resources available in the clinic .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#109:1>
In addition , in some selected high-risk groups , which include
those with a history of IGT or IFG , or those with fasting PG and HbA <sb> 1c
</sb> levels above certain cut-off levels , an OGTT is the preferred choice
of test &obrack;  Table 2 &cbrack; . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#110:1>
Conclusion </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-028#111:1>
Blood glucose has a continuum relationships with health risks ,
including both microangiopathic and cardiovascular complications , and can
interact with other risk factors such as blood pressure and blood lipids to
cause tissue damage .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#112:1>
Furthermore , microangiopathic complications such as retinopathy and
albuminuria have been reported in patients with impaired glucose tolerance ,
including Chinese patients. <sp> 37,38 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#113:1>
There is now a consensus that the fasting PG cut-off value should be
reduced to 7.0 mmol/L , although there is still controversy regarding the use
of OGTT and the definitions of IFG .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#114:1>
Data from Asia suggest that the omission of the OGTT &obrack;  hence the
2-hour PG measurement &cbrack; can lead to - at least in the Japanese and Hong Kong
Chinese populations - the missed diagnosis of glucose intolerance in a
substantial proportion of <O> Table </O> cases , if only the fasting PG
measurement is used .

<ICE-HK:W2A-028#115:1>
Hence , the 2-hour PG measurement is indicated in selected
individuals with a high risk for glucose intolerance .
