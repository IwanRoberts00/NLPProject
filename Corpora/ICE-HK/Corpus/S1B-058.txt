<ICE-HK:S1B-058#2:1:B>
Mr Deputy President <,> the Civil Aviation Department in
consultation with relevant government departments <,> will consider the need
for establishing a systematic monitoring of air quality in the arrival
frontage area <,> and will take into account the suggestion of installing
fixed monitors <O> several-speeches </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-058#3:1:B>
Mr Deputy President <,> I I think we should wait to see whether
the measures that we have already introduced will lead to an improvement in
the air quality uh if that is necessary <,> but if that does not achieve the
aims then I  ' m sure we will consider whether the replacement of diesel oil
ought to be considered <O> speech-by-Deputy-President </O>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#4:1:C>
Uh on the nineteenth of September <,> the Hong Kong Japanese
Tour Operators Association <,> wrote to the Director of Civil Aviation <,>

the subject of of Mr Howard Young has just raised <,> and enclose some plans
suggesting some improvements

Uh is the government aware of this letter and if so will it give the
idea some consideration <O> Speech of the Deputy President </O>

Secretary inform this council when the test will <.> be </.>
begin the test on air quality will start and when we will know the result <O>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#11:1:E>
Mr Deputy President <,> it has been widely reported that
recruitment of these illegal workers <,> across the border is blatant and
unchecked <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#12:1:E>
What efforts have the administration made to secure the
co-operation of Chinese law enforcement agencies <,> to stem this labour
supply at source <O> speech-by-Secretary-for-Security </O>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-058#13:1:D>
Uh Mr Deputy President <,> I have been informed by contractors
that when they approach the police <,> to assist in identifying illegal <.>
im </.> immigrants on their work sites <,> uh the police refused to do so <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#14:1:D>
I would like to ask the Secretary to inform this council <,> to
what extent the police is prepared to help contractors to identify and seek
out these <.> i </.> illegal immigrants <O> speech-by-Secretary-for-Security
</O>

<$F> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-058#15:1:F>
Mr Deputy President <,> would the Secretary <.> S </.> of
Security inform this council whether the Hong Kong Contractors Construction
Association <,> are in constant dialogue <,> with the Security Branch <,>
with the view of improving site security <,> uh in as much as uhm it involves
the police and perhaps other government departments including the <.> Im </.>
<.> In </.> Immigration Department <,> uh which so far doesn't seem to have
played any <,> degree of an active role in uh this whole uh unfortunate and
complex issue <O> speech-by-Secretary-for-Security </O>

<$G> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-058#16:1:G>
Uh thank you Mr Deputy President <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#17:1:G>
The Secretary has just said that that there are illegal workers in
government sites <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#18:1:G>
I  ' m just wondering

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#19:1:G>
This may be uh just a legal problem <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#20:1:G>
Does the government consider itself an employer of all those uh
illegal workers in government sites <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#21:1:G>
If not <,> could the government regard developers or private owners
of those sites <,> as employer of illegal immigrant in a private site <O>
speech-by-Secretary-for-Security </O>

<$H> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-058#22:1:H>
Mr Deputy President <,> in view of the increasing number of
split families caused by cross-border marriages <,> would the government
inform this council whether it will review the existing one-way permit quota
<,> of seventy-five per day <,> with a view to increasing the quota and or
setting aside a special quota for those with spouses in Hong Kong <O>
speech-by-Secretary-for-Security </O>

<$H> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-058#23:1:H>
Mr <.> Depu </.> Deputy President <,> the Secretary answered
that the allocation within the seventy-five daily quota <,> is the
responsibility of the Chinese Government <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#24:1:H>
Since Hong Kong is taking in the immigrants <,> would the review
consider to introduce a system <,> say a point system <,> where we will have
the power to screen the prospective immigrants before the quota is actually
allocated by China <O> speech-by-Secretary-for-Security </O>

<$H> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-058#25:1:H>
Mr Deputy President actually the <.> S </.> Secretary did not
answer my question <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#26:1:H>
Will the review <.> fir </.> consider this issue

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#27:1:H>
And he said uh it was in the past it was done and was not
practicable but he did not answer whether the review will consider this
question again <O> several-speeches </O>

<$E> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-058#28:1:E>
Uhm Mr Deputy President would the administration be prepared
to consider introducing a pilot scheme <,> whereby short two-way permits of
say forty-eight to seventy-two hours uhm is introduced to facilitate Chinese
mothers <,> to visit their Hong Kong children <,> during weekends <O>
several-speeches </O>

<$I> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-058#29:1:I>
Mr Deputy President <,> Targets and Target-related Assessment
or TTRA <,> are being introduced following a recommendation in Education
Commission Report Number Four <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#30:1:I>
They are designed to help teachers parents and students measure the
learning process <,> thereby contributing to more effective education <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#31:1:I>
The decision to introduce TTRA was taken by the government in
August nineteen ninety-one <,> with the support of the education community
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#32:1:I>
Since then the Education Department has developed operating plans
<,> prepared extensive briefing materials <,> and conducted numerous seminars
<,> to familiarize teachers with the new concepts and methodologies <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#33:1:I>
This will help launch TTRA <,> initially at primary four <,> and
covering the core subjects of Chinese English and Mathematics in May nineteen
ninety-three <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#34:1:I>
At the suggestion of the Omelco Education panel <,> a pilot scheme
involving twenty primary schools was introduced in September nineteen
ninety-two <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#35:1:I>
Its purpose is to obtain practical experience in the operation of
TTRA <,> and to identify possible problems which might be encountered <,> in
launching the system <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#36:1:I>
The pilot scheme should help make the full implementation of TTRA
as smooth as possible <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#37:1:I>
It follows that the effectiveness of the pilot scheme <,> should be
judged by the extent to which it either confirms that TTRA can be implemented
smoothly <,> or identifies areas where improvements and changes are necessary
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#38:1:I>
The instruments that will be used to make this assessment <,>
include questionnaires for school principals teachers pupils and parents <,>
feedback sessions and interviews with principals teachers and pupils <,> at
regular intervals <,> classroom observation <,> and school visits <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#39:1:I>
The pilot scheme is being run within the existing resources of the
participating schools <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#40:1:I>
This is because TTRA are more in the nature of an alternative
approach to learning <,> than an additional one <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#41:1:I>
However additional resources have been provided within the
Education Department <,> to develop the necessary systems and materials <,>
as well as to train teachers <,> in their new tasks <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#42:1:I>
These amount to eighteen million dollars in nineteen ninety-two
ninety-three <,> rising to thirty three million dollars in nineteen
ninety-five ninety-six <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#43:1:I>
Finally I believe it is premature to assume that some schools will
not have sufficient resources <,> to implement TTRA <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#44:1:I>
The pilot scheme may throw more light on this <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#45:1:I>
On the broader front <,> the government is implementing a range of
improvements to enable teachers to devote more individual attention to
students in schools <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#46:1:I>
These measures in particular the provision of additional teachers
<,> will contribute to making TTRA work in the desired manner <O> Several
speeches </O> <O> Speech of the deputy President </O>

<$I> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-058#47:1:I>
Mr Deputy President <,> the reduction in class sizes starting
with primary one in September nineteen ninety-three <,> is part of a coherent
and integrated package of measures <,> aimed at improving the quality of
education in our schools <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#48:1:I>
Primary one has been selected as the starting point <,> for a
number of reasons <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#49:1:I>
It is logical <,> it accords with the recommendations in Education
Commission Report Number Five <,> which have been widely supported <,> it is
likely to produce the greatest benefits in the long term <,> and it is
practicable <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#50:1:I>
To reduce secondary one classes to thirty-five as from next year
would be unrealistic <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#51:1:I>
For one thing it will require us to build sixty-five additional
schools during the next nine months <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#52:1:I>
The government  ' s plan <,> is to work through the system one level
at a time <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#53:1:I>
By nineteen ninety-eight all levels in primary schools will have
been reduced to thirty-five per class <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#54:1:I>
The smaller classes will then be extended to secondary schools <,>
commencing with secondary one <,> in nineteen ninety-nine <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#55:1:I>
By then <,> the forecast decline in secondary school enrolment <,>
will have made it possible to accommodate the smaller classes <,> without the
need for a massive school building programme <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#56:1:I>
In the meantime <,> the government has undertaken <,> to restore by
nineteen ninety-six the two repeater places per class <,> which were
withdrawn from the majority of secondary one classes <,> at the beginning of
this school year <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#57:1:I>
That undertaking still stands <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#58:1:I>
There is no question of partiality or unfairness of treatment <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#59:1:I>
The long-standing government policy is <,> to support schools at
different levels <,> to accomplish their respective missions <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#60:1:I>
Secondary schools are different from primary schools in many
respects <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#61:1:I>
For example secondary schools are bigger in size by about seventeen
per cent <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#62:1:I>
Seventy per cent of their teaching posts are at graduate uh are at
graduate level <,> compared to none at the moment for primary schools <,> and
they enjoy a more favourable staff to student ratio <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#63:1:I>
These differences apart <,> secondary schools will also benefit
from the additional resources for remedial teaching <,> and other
improvements arising from Education Commission Report Number Four <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#64:1:I>
They will also be provided with additional teachers <,> as
announced in the Governor  ' s address <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#65:1:I>
The government  ' s commitment to improving the quality of education
throughout the schooling system is now widely known and supported <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#66:1:I>
The package of measures we will be taking <,> will address specific
areas of need <,> and contribute to an overall upgrading of quality <,> and
standards <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#67:1:I>
There is no inherent reason <,> to require strict equality of
treatment <,> between sectors or levels of the education system <,> at any
particular time <,> and the absence of uniformity in no way detracts from the
impact of these improvements <O> several-speeches </O>

<$J> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-058#68:1:J>
Mr Deputy President in the reply the Secretary stated that the
that standing instructions are there to avoid the sick building syndrome in
government buildings <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#69:1:J>
Can the Secretary inform this council whether standing instructions
should also be introduced to private buildings <,> and if not why not <O>
several-speeches </O>

<$K> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-058#70:1:K>
Mr Deputy Chairman <,> the uhm the uhm <,> uh Secretary have
state that the air quality survey have been conducted in government <.> b
</.> buildings since nineteen eighty-nine and the result have shown no
serious problems

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#71:1:K>
Now I applaud the uh Secretary  ' s effort in trying to control
ventilation problems <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#72:1:K>
However as we know the sick building syndrome is related to air
pollution <,> and can occur in buildings that do not even use
air-conditioning units <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#73:1:K>
So I  ' d to know <.> w </.> what these air quality surveys actually
consist of <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#74:1:K>
Do they include <,> uh contaminants such as volatile organic acids
<,> formaldehydes <,> particular organic materials <,> microbios uhm meaning
bacterial and spores <,> all of which have been <.> con </.> uh related to
sick building syndromes <O> several-speeches </O>

<$J> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-058#75:1:J>
Uhm Mr Deputy President <,> while Germany dumps industrial
waste in Eastern Europe <,> and the United States export toxic chemicals to
Latin America <,> Hong Kong has been used as a dumping pit for dangerous and
substandard toys <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#76:1:J>
This is ironic <,> bearing in mind our relative affluence and our
status as a shoppers  '  paradise <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#77:1:J>
Absence of control is to be blamed <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#78:1:J>
Today Sir I and my colleagues in this ad hoc group are glad to
present this bill <,> which is the first piece of legislation in Hong Kong on
toys and children  ' s <,> products safety

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#79:1:J>
If carried it will provide better safeguard for consumers <,> by
making it an offence to manufacture <,> to import <,> or to supply in Hong
Kong <,> toys and children  ' s products which fail to comply with the
prescribed safety standards <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#80:1:J>
Sir since introduction of this bill in April of this year <,> the
seven-member group held eight meetings including six with the administration
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#81:1:J>
We have met with retail import and testing centres representatives
<,> and considered submissions from seven interested organizations <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#82:1:J>
The ad hoc group as well as organizations which made
representations to us <,> are in one voice <,> on the need to safeguard
children  ' s protection in Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#83:1:J>
So the question was not whether we should or should not have
statutory <.> safe </.> safety standards but what measures <,> and standards
we should adopt <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#84:1:J>
First <,> on control measure <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#85:1:J>
This bill does not <,> impose a duty on the authorities to test the
toys and children  ' s products <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#86:1:J>
And the administration has advised that the authorities will act
only on complaints <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#87:1:J>
This means that nothing will be done to test the product unless
enough injuries and enough complaints draw attention to the unsafe product
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#88:1:J>
There is absolutely no point in having a standard unless that
standard can protect our children <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#89:1:J>
What good will a prosecution do <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#90:1:J>
It can only give <.> chil </.> a child it cannot give a child her
blind eye <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#91:1:J>
It offers little comfort <,> to a grieving parent when child when
children has been killed by <.> le </.> lethal toys <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#92:1:J>
What we want then are preventive measures <,> not <?> laid back
</?> damage control actions after a child <,> is maimed or killed <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#93:1:J>
The ad hoc group was very concerned about the effectiveness of this
approach <,> and suggested the administration to consider imposing compulsory
pre-sales testing <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#94:1:J>
This measure was recommended by some of the submissions too <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#95:1:J>
The administration advise us that they have examined the options
but decided against it <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#96:1:J>
While accepting the difficulties with regard to mandatory pre-sales
testing <,> the ad hoc group still considered <,> a more pro-active system of
control necessary to prevent injuries <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#97:1:J>
We therefore recommended <,> that some incentives be provided to
suppliers <,> to encourage them to have their products tested before they go
on the shelf <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#98:1:J>
To address the group  ' s concerns <,> the administration finally
agreed to insert a clause to the effect that a voluntary pre-sale testing
certificate will be considered as evidence for defence <,> to a charge under
this ordinance <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#99:1:J>
They also undertook to increase manpower to conduct random testing
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#100:1:J>
Sir I now turn to the question of safety standards <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#101:1:J>
The bill proposes to adopt the standards devised by the British
Standards Institute for children  ' s products <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#102:1:J>
This was <.> accept </.> accepted by the group without much
argument <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#103:1:J>
The deliberation on the standards of toys however Sir was a
frustration <,> and drawn-out process <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#104:1:J>
With your indulgence I will elaborate on that <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#105:1:J>
The bill proposes to adopt for the adoption of the International
Committee of Toys Industry <,> or in short ICTI standards for toys <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#106:1:J>
The group questioned this from the onset <,> having regarded to
the fact the ICTI standard was not as up-to-date as some other standards and
that the level of toxic chemicals in ICTI <,> which ICTI allows is much
higher <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#107:1:J>
The administration explained that the adoption of an international
standard instead of a national standard would avoid possible accusation of
Hong Kong being biased <,> towards the standard of a particular country

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#108:1:J>
They assured us <O> coughs </O> the ad hoc group that ICTI was
very similar to the standards developed by other major markets <,> and was
supported by the Hong Kong Toys Council

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#109:1:J>
Here I would like to stress <,> supported by the Hong Kong Toys
Council <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#110:1:J>
As regards the possibility of including other national standards
in the bill in addition to the ICTI standards <,> the administration was
concerned that this might result in toy suppliers choosing to meet only the
lower safety requirements of the different aspects of the safety standards
<,> thus resulting in a set of and I quote lower standard unquote for Hong
Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-058#111:1:J>
It was on this strength <,> of these arguments that the ad hoc
group was persuaded into accepting the recommendation </I>
