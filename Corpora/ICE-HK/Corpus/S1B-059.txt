Mr Deputy President the contents of diplomatic exchanges
between governments are by convention confidential <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#2:1:A>
Members of the Executive Council are briefed on discussions of Hong
Kong issues between the British and <.> Hong </.> and Chinese Governments <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#3:1:A>
The British Government  ' s position as set out in discussions with
the Chinese Vice-Premier in London remains as follows <,> <X> <quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#X4:1:A>
Her Majesty  ' s Government strongly supports the Governor and his
constitutional proposals which are fully consistent with the Joint
Declaration and the Basic Law <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#X5:1:A>
There has been no change in Her Majesty  ' s Government  ' s policy
towards Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#X6:1:A>
It remains Her Majesty  ' s Government  ' s wish to work in
co-operation with China for a smooth transition on the basis of the Joint
Declaration <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#X7:1:A>
And we are prepared to consider any proposals the Chinese side
might have to make <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#X8:1:A>
The Governor has also made it clear that he intends to make himself
available regularly to answer questions from members of this council and to
discuss government policy <,> and proposals <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#X9:1:A>
He will next do this on first December <,> </quote> </X> <O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#10:1:A>
Mr Deputy President <,> the Governor is on record as saying
that there will be no secret agreement <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#11:1:A>
And it is also <,> the truth of the matter that any proposals that
require legislation and funding will have to be approved by this council and
so therefore I do not see how we could agree to changes of uh changes in the
<.> Gov </.> radical changes in the Governor  ' s proposals without coming to
this council <O> member's-question </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#12:1:A>
Mr Deputy President the constitution and composition of the
<.> Le </.> Executive Council is laid down in our constitutional documents of
Letters Patent and Royal Instructions

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#13:1:A>
I  ' ve got nothing to add to that Sir <O> member's-question </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#14:1:A>
Mr Deputy <,,> the question is academic as we do not have any
intention of releasing any further documents <O> speech-by-Mr-Jimmy-McGregor
</O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#15:1:A>
Mr Deputy President <,> the Governor  ' s proposals are for
discussion <,> within Hong Kong and with China <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#16:1:A>
We cannot force anybody to discuss those proposals with us <,> and
the Governor has also indicated there is a time scale <,> for us to bring
legislative proposals to this council <,> in order that the electoral
arrangement for the nineteen ninety-four ninety-five elections could be put
in place in good time and we intend to follow that timetable <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#17:1:A>
This means that when the time for decision comes along we will have
to make the best judgment that we can

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#18:1:B>
Mr Deputy President in the Secretary  ' s reply he said that
members of the Executive Council are briefed on discussions <,> uh between
the British and Chinese Governments

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#19:1:B>
I recall the last time the subject was raised the Secretary first
said that Exco members were briefed <,> and then when asked by Miss Emily Lau
whether they saw the documents or not the reply that they saw the documents
uh which is quite different from being briefed <,> and in fact seeing in a
pile could be different from reading

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#20:1:B>
So I would to Secretary clarify when he said briefed does that
meaning just briefed uh without seeing and reading documents only

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#21:1:A>
Sir we are referring to two different time periods <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#22:1:A>
My answer that the honourable member referred to was in respect of
the seven diplomatic exchanges

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#23:1:A>
My answer today <,> relates to a question <,> from Honourable Miss
Emily Lau which relates to the period after seventh October

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#24:1:A>
So it is briefed Sir <O> member's-question </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#25:1:A>
Mr Deputy President regrettably no <O> Speech-by-Mr-Peter-Wong
</O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#26:1:A>
Mr Deputy President <,> I thought the language was very clear
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#27:1:A>
Obviously for those proposals <,> to command <,> respect they will
have to meet <,> the Governor  ' s very public bottom line <,> namely that they
should be open <,> fair and acceptable to the people of Hong Kong <O>
member's-question </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#28:1:A>
Mr Deputy President <,> the question of whether <,> either the
either side to the Joint Declaration will stick by <,> that document do not
actually arise <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#29:1:A>
Because I understand <,> that the Chinese Premier  ' s query on
sixteenth of November <,> as referred to by the honourable member was raised
<,> at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London in response to
a question <,> and this preceded his meeting with the Prime Minister and
Foreign Secretary

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#30:1:A>
While it would be inappropriate for me <,> to comment on the remark
of the official concerned <,> but we understand the Chinese Government  ' s
spokesman has subsequently clarified those remarks <O> member's-question </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#31:1:A>
Mr Deputy President <,,> the proposals <,> are for discussion
<,> within Hong Kong <,> and with China

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#32:1:A>
So therefore <,> even if one party do not put forward proposals <,>
I would wish and I would appeal to the people of Hong Kong to come up with
alternatives if they do not like the proposals that we have put forward <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#33:1:A>
As to the circumstances which we will <,> consider to changing our
proposals I would only say that if other proposals command <,> more support
<,> than the proposals that we have put forward <,> we will consider those
<O> member's-question </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#34:1:A>
Mr Deputy President <,,> part C of my reply refers to <,> HMG  ' s
wish to work in co-operation with China <,> for a smooth transition <,> on
the basis of the Joint Declaration <,,> and this we are precisely doing
because the Governor  ' s proposals are entirely consistent with the Joint
Declaration <O> member's-question </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#35:1:A>
Mr Deputy President <,,> unfortunately the process of
negotiation and discussions with China <,> has not commenced <O>
member's-question </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#36:1:A>
Mr Deputy President the answer is no <O> Speech-Mr-Moses-Cheng
</O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#37:1:A>
This is a very big question Mr Deputy President

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#38:1:A>
I think HMG  ' s policy towards Hong Kong <,> uh is <,,> to assist us
with a smooth transition <,> and on the basis of the Joint Declaration <O>
Speech-by-Mr-Stephen-Cheong </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#39:1:A>
Mr Deputy President I can only say that the Joint Declaration
and the Basic Law are two separate documents <O> member's-question </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#40:1:C>
Mr Deputy President <,> the current Scheme of Control
Agreement with the Hong Kong Electric Company Limited HEC expires on
thirty-first December nineteen ninety-three <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#41:1:C>
Clause nine three of this agreement provides for discussions
regarding a revision and extension of the agreement <,> on terms and
conditions that are then found to be mutually acceptable <,> to take place
within the three years prior to the date of expiry <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#42:1:C>
In accordance with this provision discussions with HEC commenced in
June this year and are still continuing <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#43:1:C>
Whilst negotiations are proceeding it would not be appropriate for
me to disclose what changes if any to the provisions of the current scheme
are being contemplated

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#44:1:C>
I can assure members however that the review now underway is
comprehensive and thorough <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#45:1:C>
Our aim is to ensure that consumers in HEC  ' s supply area will
continue to receive an efficient and reliable electricity supply <,> at a
reasonable cost <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#46:1:C>
Mr Deputy President I would like to make clear that in leading
these discussions on behalf of the government <,> I am mindful of the
commitments which I gave in this council at the conclusion of the motion
debate on franchises and schemes of control on thirteenth November nineteen
ninety-one

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#47:1:C>
Members of the <.> O </.> Omelco Economic Services and Public
Utilities Panel will be briefed fully on the outcome of the negotiations and
the terms of the new Scheme of Control Agreement will be made public in the
normal way <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#48:1:C>
The administration is well aware of the concerns felt by members of
this council and the general public with regard to the operation of the power
companies  '  schemes of control <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#49:1:C>
We will give full weight to the views which have been expressed and
to any relevant social financial of economic developments which indicate the
need for change <O> member's-question </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#50:1:C>
Mr Deputy President <,> the range and complexity of franchises
and schemes of control governing the provision of various utilities was
thoroughly debated in this council on thirteenth November nineteen ninety-one

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#51:1:C>
I have nothing to add to the statement I made at that time <O>
member's-question </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#52:1:C>
Sir I have nothing to add to my principal reply <O>
member's-question </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#53:1:C>
Mr Deputy President in the uhm newly uhm negotiated agreement
with China Light and Power Company the government has included provisions to
encourage efficiency and conservation <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#54:1:C>
Uhm we contemplate doing the same as regards the current
negotiations with HEC

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#55:1:C>
I should however point out that the question of reducing demand is
of course <.> res </.> the responsibility of not only the operating companies
but also of all the consumers whether they are domestic <.> in </.>
industrial or commercial users <O> member's-question </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#56:1:C>
Mr Deputy President <,> the operation of the Scheme of Control
Agreement with both power companies are of course carefully monitored by the
government

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#57:1:C>
The government generally is satisfied that it is working well

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#58:1:C>
Obviously in negotiating the new scheme of control we will be
anxious to <.> en </.> ensure that monitoring mechanisms remain adequate <O>
speech-by-Mr-Peter-Wong </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#59:1:C>
Uh Mr Deputy President the need <.> fo </.> to introduce
various demand management uhm controls are of course part and parcel of
reviewing the Scheme of Control Agreement

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#60:1:C>
Uhm <.> th </.> the government would not in any event be uh
approving additional generating plants unless and until there is a proven
demand for additional capacity <O> member's-question </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#61:1:C>
Sir that question would seem to be so far removed from the
principal reply but if statistics are required to the extent that they are
not made public I will see what we can do to supply the statistics <O>
member's-question </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#62:1:C>
Mr Deputy President obviously in the in conducting the current
negotiations on the renewal of the Scheme of Control Agreement we will inter
alia be looking at the basis for calculating profits <O> several-speeches
</O>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#63:1:D>
Mr Deputy President <,> in the Secretary  ' s reply he said
regular inspection constant monitoring and expeditious response to complaints
will continue <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#64:1:D>
I  ' d like to know that on a how <.> o </.> often can a restaurant
owner reasonably expect to be inspected uh without a complaint from any
citizen

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#X65:1:Z>
<{> <[> Secretary </[> </X>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#66:1:D>
<[> whether he </[> </{> considers that to be reasonable or
enough <O> several-speeches </O>

<$E> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#67:1:E>
Thank you Mr Deputy President <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#68:1:E>
The Secretary in his answer uh said that the <,> uh drop in the
number of transactions <,> uh registered with the Land Office are is being
monitored very closely <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#69:1:E>
Could he perhaps tell us <,,> with some details as to the number of
transactions a year ago as opposed to uh in the in the latest months that he
has information on and the extent of the level of the drop <,> as well as the
uh price levels if he has those details <O> several-speeches </O>

<$F> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#70:1:F>
Uh Mr Deputy President will the administration firstly inform
this council <,> whether the since the beginning of nineteen ninety-two <,>
British Dependent Territory Citizens or BDTC <,> and British National
Overseas or BNO passports <,> holders have been subject to more stringent
immigration clearance require more that requirement than before when
travelling to and or seeking to remain in the EC countries <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#71:1:F>
And secondly to confirm with the UK Government whether the latter
has issued any kind of notification to other EC countries reminding them to
pay special attention to holders of British passports issued in Hong Kong
because the UK is to hand over Hong Kong to China in nineteen ninety-seven

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#72:1:F>
And thirdly up-date to up-date this council on the progress of
international recognition <,> of the BNO passports <O>
Speech-by-Secretary-for-Security </O>

<$F> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#73:1:F>
Mr Deputy President since the uhm answer to the second part of
my question is a flat no <,> I wonder if the administration can enlighten
this council whether the flat no means that the Hong Kong Government will not
confirm with the UK Government or whether the UK Government has denied
issuing any kind of notification to other EC countries to the effect that
special attention be made to passports issued in Hong Kong because the UK is
to hand over Hong Kong to China in nineteen ninety-seven <O>
Speech-by-Secretary-for-Security </O>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#74:1:D>
Mr Deputy President <,> will the Secretary inform this council
<,> since the holders of BDTC and BNO passport currently can enter some EEC
countries without visa <,> will steps be taken to normalise so that holders
of BNO and BDTC passports can enter all EEC nations without visa starting
nineteen ninety-three <O> several-speeches </O>

<$E> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#75:1:E>
Mr Deputy President <,> as a follow-up of the Secretary  ' s
answer as far as I understand it the Austrian Government  ' s refusal to allow
BNO passport holders to enter Austria without the visa <,> is due to the
reluctance on the part of Her Majesty  ' s Government <,> to give an
undertaking for paying for the repatriation costs <,> of any <.> B </.> BNO
passport holder in in the event that that should arise <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#76:1:E>
I wonder whether the Secretary can throw some light on that <O>
several-speeches </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#77:1:B>
Mr Deputy President <,> uh in addition to the one point six
billion million holders of BDT passports and <.> B </.> <unc> one-word
</unc> point four million BNO passports there is a large chunk of Hong
Kong  ' s international travelling population that holds Certificates of
Identity <,> in other words the one point three million <,> or forty per cent
uh of these travellers

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#78:1:B>
Uh will the government inform this council whether all the efforts
being made to gain meaningful recognition and privileges for holders of our
travel documents uh will also be directed somewhat in the direction helping
holders of Certificates of Identity as well as they are the underprivileged
when they comes to privileges <O> several-speeches </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#79:1:B>
I think my question <?> has been </?> misunderstood

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#80:1:B>
I referred to the point uh one point three million holders of
Certificates of Identity which are not eligible to hold BNO or BDT passports
<O> several-speeches </O>

<$G> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-059#81:1:G>
Mr Deputy President <,> I move the motion standing in my name
on the order paper in respect of the Pharmacy and Poisons Amendment
Regulation nineteen ninety-two <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#82:1:G>
The recent increase in cases of abuse of cough medicines especially
amongst our young people <,> calls for tighter control on the sale of cough
medicines containing codeine <,> or dextromethorphan

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#83:1:G>
Under the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance and its Regulations
different types of poisons are subject to different levels of control <,>
owing to difference in potency <,> toxicity <,> and side-effects <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#84:1:G>
At present only cough medicines containing more than one point five
per cent of codeine <,> or dextromethorphan are first schedule poisons

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#85:1:G>
They should be stored in a receptacle which is securely locked and
their sale requires proper entry into a poisons book <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#86:1:G>
However <,> in view of the increasing abuse of cough medicines
containing less than one point five but more than zero point one per cent <,>
of either of the two poisons it is desirable to extend control on first
schedule poisons to substances containing more than zero point one per cent
of codeine <,> or dextromethorphan <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#87:1:G>
Under section twenty-nine <,> of the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance
the Pharmacy and Poisons Board <,> subject to the approval of this council
may make regulations controlling the sale of poisons <,> and medicines <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#88:1:G>
Accordingly <,> the board has agreed to amend the first schedule to
the Pharmacy and Poisons Regulations to achieve tighter control <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#89:1:G>
The approval of this council is now sought <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-059#90:1:G>
Mr Deputy President I beg to move </I>
