<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#3:1>
A recent official study has found that human activities such as
farming , deforesting and mining , combined with population growth and global
climate change , are wrecking the fragile ecosystem in the western region .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#4:1>
The study , &ldquo; An Investigation of the Western Region  ' s
Ecological Situation" , was carried out by the State Environmental Protection
Agency , the Chinese Academy of Sciences and 12 provincial research centres .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#5:1>
It urges immediate measures to protect the region  ' s ecology , the
<it> China Youth Daily </it> quoted the report as saying . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#6:1>
Using various social , economic and scientific data up to 1999 ,
the study assessed various environmental indicators such as soil erosion ,
desertification , salination and deforestation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#7:1>
It found that more than 104.3 million hectares in the region
suffer from serious soil erosion .

<ICE-HK:W2B-025#8:1>
In some provinces , eroded land accounts for more than 50 per cent of
total land area . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#9:1>
The western provinces of Inner Mongolia , Gansu , Ningxia ,
Shaanxi , Tibet and Xinjiang now have more than 162 million hectares of
desert , while the regions of Chongqing , Sichuan , Yunnan and Guizhou have
7.2 million hectares of salinised land . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#10:1>
Forests and grasslands have been destroyed as a result of their
conversion into arable land .

<ICE-HK:W2B-025#11:1>
From 1986 to 1999 , grasslands decreased 69.5 per cent , while
forests decreased 22 per cent . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#12:1>
The authors believe that the destruction has led to a cycle of
ecological disasters such as increased soil erosion , plant diseases , rodent
outbreaks , water table shrinkage and the alkalification of lake and river
water . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#13:1>
The report says that from the 1980s to the 1990s , natural
disasters such as sand storms and floods doubled . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#14:1>
Population growth and economic development have upset the region  ' s
ecological balance . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#15:1>
The report notes environmentally destructive activities such as
mining have more than doubled since 1986 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#16:1>
More than 1.8 million hectares of land are used for mining in the
provinces of Qinghai , Shaanxi , Ningxia and Inner Mongolia alone . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#17:1>
The report alludes to the Government  ' s attempt to protect the
region by raising environmental standards . But it says &ldquo; there is a
huge gap between what can be realistically monitored and managed" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#18:1>
The report urges local authorities to take immediate measures
such as promoting less environmentally destructive economic activities like
small-scale farming and herding . </p>

<bold> US waste ` dumped ' on mainland </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-025#20:2>
<bold> Report says toxic wiring and computer parts damaging health
and making water undrinkable </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-025#21:2>
<bold> Ray Cheung </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#22:2>
Highly toxic wiring and computer waste shipped from the United
States is seriously damaging China  ' s environment and mainlanders ' health ,
according to an international report . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#23:2>
The report , <it> Exporting Harm: The High-Tech Trashing of Asia
</it> , estimates that up to 80 per cent of all electronic waste originating
from the US is exported to Asia . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#24:2>
This is estimated to be about 100 million waste computer parts .

<ICE-HK:W2B-025#25:2>
China is the main destination followed by India and Pakistan . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#26:2>
The report was written by the US-based Basel Action Network and
Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition , Toxics Link India , Greenpeace China and
the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment in Pakistan , who
focused their investigation on an electronic waste recycling centre in the
Guiyu region of Guangdong near the Lian River .

<ICE-HK:W2B-025#27:2>
They found serious environmental and health damage . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#28:2>
Investigators witnessed men , women and children involved in the
hazardous practice of burning plastics , wire and soldered circuit boards in
the open and cracking and dumping toxic lead-laden cathode-ray tubes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#29:2>
The waste was being dumped along rivers , in open fields and
irrigation canals in rice , making local water undrinkable . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#30:2>
Water now has to be trucked in from 30km away . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#31:2>
While it blamed the conditions partly on China  ' s lax
environmental laws , the report placed its chief responsibility on the United
States . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#32:2>
&ldquo; They call this recycling , but it  ' s really dumping by
another name . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#33:2>
&ldquo; Yet to our horror , we further discovered that rather
than banning it , the United States Government is actually encouraging this
ugly trade to avoid finding real solutions to the massive tide of obsolete
computer waste generated in the US daily , &rdquo; Jim Puckett , the report
co-ordinator , said . </p> <O> A photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#37:2>
The report said the US was the only developed country in the
world that had failed to ratify the Basle Convention , a United Nations
environmental treaty which has adopted a global ban on the export of
hazardous wastes from the world  ' s most developed countries to developing
ones . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#38:2>
The US had actually exempted toxic electronic waste from its own
laws governing exports because the material was claimed to be destined for
recycling . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#39:2>
The US-based National Science Foundation estimated that between
1997 and 2004 , the US would generate more than 315 million obsolete computer
parts . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#40:2>
The problem is growing and the report urged the US to implement
an immediate global ban on the export of hazardous wastes and mandate the
electronics industry to institute take-back recycling programmes and phase
out the use of toxic substances in the equipment . </p>

<bold> Deadly parasites in water source </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-025#42:3>
<bold> Study finds cancer-causing dioxin and huge numbers of stomach
bugs in Dongjiang river </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-025#43:3>
<bold> Cheung Chi-fai </bold> and <bold> Quinton Chan </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#44:3>
High concentrations of potentially deadly parasites and a small
amount of cancer-causing dioxin have been found in water and sediment from
the Dongjiang river - the source of most of Hong Kong  ' s drinking water .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#45:3>
The findings by the Open University follow the disclosure last
week by the Water Supplies Department that low levels of two parasites -
giardia and cryptosporidium - had been found in three samples of treated Hong
Kong water over the past three years . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#46:3>
Tests by the university found the parasites were present in 40
per cent of raw water samples taken from the Dongjiang and three local
reservoirs .

<ICE-HK:W2B-025#47:3>
The bugs can cause serious intestinal diseases and even kill people
with weak immune systems .

<ICE-HK:W2B-025#48:3>
Small quantities of dioxin were also found for the first time in
Dongjiang sediment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#49:3>
Researchers found up to one million cryptosporidium and 10,000
giardia specimens per litre of water in the most polluted Dongjiang tributary
in Sima , Guangdong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-025#50:3>
At Plover Cove and Shek Pik reservoirs , up to 100,000
cryptosporidium and 10,000 giardia per litre were discovered . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#51:3>
Research team leader Dr Ho Kin-chung said the results had
worrying long-term health implications , despite the team  ' s failure to
detect the parasites in treated water samples . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#52:3>
&ldquo; The findings raise concern over the long-term health risk
to people as we have found the parasites existing almost everywhere along the
tributary , &rdquo; he said .

<ICE-HK:W2B-025#53:3>
&ldquo; We cannot always rely on the treatment plants to deal with
this rising problem .

<ICE-HK:W2B-025#54:3>
It cannot be reliable all the time . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#55:3>
The team  ' s findings are in sharp contrast to test results from
the Water Supplies Department , which suggested only low levels of the
parasites were present in Dongjiang water from the Muk Wu Pumping Station ,
the first point on the river from which water is diverted to Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#56:3>
It found just seven out of 38 raw samples were contaminated
between November 1999 and February this year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#57:3>
Levels ranged from 0.29 to 0.8 specimens per litre for
cryptosporidium and 0.04 to 5.88 for giardia . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#58:3>
Although there is no internationally accepted safety limit for
the parasites , the British standard for cryptosporidium is 0.1 specimens per
litre . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#59:3>
Evidence that treatment did not totally eliminate the bugs
emerged with the disclosure that three treated samples were found with
cryptosporidium in April and August 1999 and in December 2000 , at treatment
plants in Sha Tin and Au Tau .

<ICE-HK:W2B-025#60:3>
None exceeded the British treatment standard and were not a health
concern , the department said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#61:3>
The Dongjiang tributary , which runs through several Guangdong
cities , channels water to the SAR .

<ICE-HK:W2B-025#62:3>
Apart from Shek Pik , Plover Cove and Shing Mun reservoirs , all
others contain water imported from Guangdong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#63:3>
Dr Ho , also a member of the Advisory Committee on Quality of
Water Supplies , urged the Government to expand raw water monitoring both in
the Dongjiang and local reservoirs .

<ICE-HK:W2B-025#64:3>
However , a spokesman for the department played down the significance
of the university findings and emphasised that Hong Kong drinking water was
safe . </p> <O> Two photos </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#65:3>
<bold> Crytosporidium &obrack;  left &cbrack; and giardia parasites can cause
serious intestinal diseases or even death . </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#66:3>
&ldquo; All natural streams , rivers and even underground water
might contain such parasites .

<ICE-HK:W2B-025#67:3>
There is no surprise and no big deal about that , &rdquo; he said ,
adding it was not a problem if the water was treated . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#68:3>
At present , only six of the SAR  ' s 20 treatment plants are
equipped to test for the parasites . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#69:3>
Deputy director of the Conservancy Association Lister Cheung Lai-
ping , another water advisory committee member , said the tests results made
a mockery of the department  ' s goal of providing water that was safe to drink
straight from the tap . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#70:3>
&ldquo; If we are heading to the target of direct consumption ,
the Government needs to further monitor the parasite level of Dongjiang water
, &rdquo; she said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#71:3>
Howard Liu Hung-to , Greenpeace campaign director , was shocked
to learn that dioxin was found in the sediment .

<ICE-HK:W2B-025#72:3>
&ldquo; Even though only a small amount was found , it still
indicates that the dioxin contamination along the river had been very serious
, as the dilution in the river water should have removed most of it . &rdquo;
</p>

<bold> Officials dismiss EU bar on mainland foods </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-025#74:4>
<bold> Klaudia Lee </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#75:4>
Health officials say food products imported from the mainland are
safe despite bans imposed by the European Union , which claims they contain
potentially hazardous antibiotics and chemicals . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#76:4>
Food products ranging from honey to frozen chicken were banned by
the EU in January after tests revealed them to contain potentially harmful
toxins . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#77:4>
Hong Kong has also banned many of the substances found , but
officials said their test results contradicted the EU  ' s and they found no
traces of harmful chemicals . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#78:4>
They also said the mainland claimed the EU report into the
allegedly tainted foods was inaccurate and exaggerated the situation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#79:4>
The difference of opinion has prompted calls for a stepping up of
Hong Kong  ' s food sampling procedures and a claim by a legislator that the EU
ban may be politically motivated . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#80:4>
In a written reply to legislators last week explaining the
situation , Secretary for the Environment and Food Lily Yam Kwan Pui-ying
said despite the EU ban , no antibiotics had been detected in foodstuffs
imported from the mainland over the past three years . </p> <O> A diagram
</O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#81:4>
Democrat Fred Li Wah-ming said Hong Kong need not follow the EU
's lead to impose the food ban as the EU action could be politically
motivated . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#82:4>
The EU made the decision after an inspection team found in
November last year that prohibited antibiotics and beta-blockers , such as
chloramphenicol and clenbuterol , were widely used on some mainland farms .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#83:4>
Reports of chloramphenicol being detected in samples of mainland
shrimps or prawns have been made repeatedly by EU member states since August
last year , according to an EU inspection report . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#84:4>
Chloramphenicol is a potent , broad-spectrum antibiotic , banned
for use in food-producing animals in the EU since 1994 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-025#85:4>
The effects of the drug on humans can include bone-marrow depression .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#86:4>
The EU banned the use of clenbuterol in producing livestock in
1996 after it was found that people who consumed the chemical suffered an
increased heart rate , headaches and a reduction in blood pressure . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#87:4>
Both chemicals are banned in Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#88:4>
Among foods banned by the EU are honey , frozen chicken meat ,
frozen rabbit meat , frozen shrimps and frozen crabs .

<ICE-HK:W2B-025#89:4>
In all , 499,266 tonnes of these food products have been imported
into Hong Kong over the past three years . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#90:4>
Mrs Yam said the Government has contacted the EU office in Hong
Kong and the mainland  ' s State General Administration for Quality Supervision
and Inspection and Quarantine . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#91:4>
Mainland authorities said the inspection report was inaccurate
and exaggerated the seriousness of the issue . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#92:4>
Juan Victor Monfort , first counsellor for Trade and Economic
Affairs at the European Union office in Hong Kong , said EU representatives
would continue discussions with China about the lifting of the bans . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#93:4>
However , he said the EU could not ask the Hong Kong Government
to impose the ban and that &ldquo; it  ' s up to the HK Government to make its
own decision" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#94:4>
In her reply , Mrs Yam said since the Public Health &obrack;  Animals and
Birds &cbrack; &obrack;  Chemical Residues &cbrack; Regulation and Harmful Substances in Food &obrack; 
Amendment &cbrack; Regulation 2001 came into effect on December 31 last year , no
antibiotics had been found in the food samples , including the 64 samples of
products imported from the mainland taken between January and March this year .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#95:4>
The two pieces of legislation forbid the use of seven prohibited
chemicals , including chloramphenicol , and restrict the use of 10 chemicals .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#96:4>
A department spokeswoman said a health certificate was needed for
every food item imported into the territory and samples were taken at the
border and during the resale and wholesale processes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#97:4>
Lo Wing-lok , an infectious disease expert and legislator
representing the medical sector , said: &ldquo; Some of the mainland farms
may not have a strict monitoring system .

<ICE-HK:W2B-025#98:4>
That  ' s why taking samples from different farms would make a
difference . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-025#99:4>
Dr Lo said Hong Kong requires stringent testing of imported food
products , but he urged the Government to widen the scope of sample testing
and strengthen co-operation with its mainland counterparts . </p>
