<ICE-HK:S2A-055#1:1:A>
Uh my name is Dary Lee

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#2:1:A>
I am the CAD Systems Manager of Future Solutions

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#3:1:A>
Welcome to this seminars <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#4:1:A>
First of all I would like to take some time to introduce our company
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#5:1:A>
Future Solution Laboratory Limited is a software developer and <?>
system integrator </?> based in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#6:1:A>
We are specialized in the architectural and engineering and
construction industry and also the GIS industry

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#7:1:A>
We carry a lot of products such as the Tracer which will be
introduced today uh and other package such as <?> Optimus </?> for <?>
machine </?> management uhm

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#8:1:A>
And also the AutoDesk uh fringe components

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#9:1:A>
Our major client in Hong Kong include the uh government bodies such
as the Housing Authority and also the public utilities uh such as the China
Light and Power and the Hong Kong Electric Company <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#10:1:A>
Today we are going to present a new technology called AutoCAD
System from IGS

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#11:1:A>
The software that we want to introduce today is called Tracer from
AutoCAD <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#12:1:A>
Tracer has been in the market for two years time

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#13:1:A>
It  ' s quite new in Hong Kong just for one year

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#14:1:A>
Despite its short history Tracer technology has been installed in
over forty countries world-wide <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#15:1:A>
So why do we begin Tracer

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#16:1:A>
Because the history of CAD is just about five to ten years uh in
this world

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#17:1:A>
Uhm before that we draw uhm we draw all the things on papers

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#18:1:A>
So a lot of paper drawings is produced previously <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#19:1:A>
The existing paper drawings needs a lot of needs means a lot of
large investment <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#20:1:A>
So we get to think of how to utilize our previous <.> in </.>
investment <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#21:1:A>
So the best way to utilize it is to <.> con </.> to convert all the
existing drawings into the digital format or the CAD format

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#22:1:A>
There  ' re two methods to achieve this

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#23:1:A>
The first one is to use the digitizers to digitize all the existing
drawing memory into the computer

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#24:1:A>
And the second approach is to copy all the drawings to that is to
be <?> drawn </?> all drawings in the CAD environment

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#25:1:A>
Both methods are very tedious and time consuming <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#26:1:A>
But now there  ' s another alternative

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#27:1:A>
With the help of Tracer and Recognizer from AutoCAD you can easily
convert the <?> raster </?> drawings to <unc> one word </unc>
drawings uh very uh easily

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#28:1:A>
<unc> one-word </unc> <?> in time </?> break induction and
conversion times uhm called saving <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#29:1:A>
Under the IBS umbrella there are many alternatives for document
conversion

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#30:1:A>
User can choose to have uh <unc> one-word </unc> digitizing
raster overlay raster everything or to do the what we call the <?>
meta-transition </?> process using two functions

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#31:1:A>
The first one is called the semi-automatic <?> interactive line
tracing </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#32:1:A>
And second one is called the automatic text and graphic definitions
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#33:1:A>
Tracer is the only software available in this market

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#34:1:A>
And it works on <unc> one-words </unc> <?> AutoCAD </?>
environment to provide the above functions <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#35:1:A>
Beside from working all the paper document <?> complete </?> into
CAD format we have another alternative which is called incremental conversion

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#36:1:A>
This is to integrate the raster and <.> res </.> <?> rester </?>
image into one single <.> s </.> system

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#37:1:A>
What we call is the HyperCAD environment <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#38:1:A>
So we can have eliminated that because we convert drawing on a
as-is basis

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#39:1:A>
So what is a HyperCAD system

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#40:1:A>
Uhm as you are familiar with AutoCAD you use it to draw the line
circle text or dimension into the computer

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#41:1:A>
Those lines circles texts are called the <unc> four words
</unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#42:1:A>
Beside the <unc> four words </unc> there  ' s <.> ano </.>
another thing called raster

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#43:1:A>
What  ' s a raster

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#44:1:A>
Raster is those image that is scanned in from the scanner

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#45:1:A>
Those images are form of tiny dot uh which we use the term called
dpi to describe it say two hundred or three hundred or four hundred dpi

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#46:1:A>
The dpi is called called the dots per inch <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#47:1:A>
Traditional AutoCAD environment cannot handle those uhm raster
image

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#48:1:A>
It can only allow users to draw <?> erectus </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#49:1:A>
But with the help of Tracer <,> user is allowed to overlay the
raster image in the AutoCAD environment so that it can perform something
called the <?> Pilot </?> Editing

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#50:1:A>
We will describe it uh later <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#51:1:A>
So what Tracer provide to user is it it provides user with <?>
rasoframe </?> <.> capabi capabi </.> capabilities <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#52:1:A>
And also a complete set of raster editing tools and also the
precision tool kit for AC and <?> practical film </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#53:1:A>
Uhm besides uh the editing function Tracer also provide the uh some
other call the scanning post- <unc> one-word </unc> function such as
<unc> one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#54:1:A>
<unc> one-word </unc> is the transformation of the geometry
of the scanned image into another form because uh what we talking about
scanning image we are refer to very old drawings all <.> tho </.> all the old
drawings uh may be still or distorted when scan in

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#55:1:A>
So we need some tools uh to correct those stilling and distortion

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#56:1:A>
Those are a group those uhm methods is called <?> worksheeting </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#57:1:A>
Another thing is uh <.> re </.> regarding the uh <unc> one-word
</unc> process is called the noise removal

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#58:1:A>
Noise removal is to because uh most of the old drawings are <?>
very dirty </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#59:1:A>
There may be spark on the drawings

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#60:1:A>
The noise removal is to remove all those unnecessary spark <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#61:1:A>
We will demonstrate it later

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#62:1:A>
Also the Tracer support eleven different raster formats so you can
communicate with other uh raster systems as well <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#63:1:A>
Another superior function for Tracer is the semi automatic line
following

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#64:1:A>
It  ' s the only way to provide <unc> one-word </unc> and
head frame <unc> one-word </unc> to convert the <?> raster </?> image
to <unc> one-word </unc> <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#65:1:A>
There is furthermore there  ' s another module it  ' s called the
Recognizer for AutoCAD

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#66:1:A>
It  ' s another module

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#67:1:A>
It can automatically convert the graphic and text uhm image into
AutoCAD <?> as </?> string arch circle and also <unc> one-word </unc>
lines <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#68:1:A>
So why Tracer is so important

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#69:1:A>
Because in this world there are one point eight billion paper
documents

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#70:1:A>
Only twenty percent of uh these documents are in visual format or
in CAD format

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#71:1:A>
So Tracer is the only tool for you to re-utilized those paper
documents <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#72:1:A>
From this chart you can see that the productivity gains when using
Tracer

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#73:1:A>
For normal handy drafting uh uhm it takes about say uh ten times to
finish the drawing

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#74:1:A>
But with the help of uhm Tracer it can increase it five to to ten
times <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#75:1:A>
Tracer can apply in these areas <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#76:1:A>
The first one is the architectural of the city management

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#77:1:A>
Uh the second is the mapping of GIS area

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#78:1:A>
The third one is the civil engineering field

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#79:1:A>
And the fourth one is the electrical and the practical area as well
as the piping process and also uh the document management process <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#80:1:A>
In the architectural area we can <unc> one-word </unc> the
existing floor plan or the design or for <unc> one-word </unc>
management purpose

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#81:1:A>
Also you can use it to update <.> s as </.> field plan

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#82:1:A>
This is so what called incremental conversion <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#83:1:A>
For the civil engineer uh area you can use the Tracer to trace the
contour lines to create the DTN model

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#84:1:A>
The DTN is the three D digital terrain modeling models <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#85:1:A>
So that you can use the the result DTN model for <unc> one-word
</unc> or or uh go about design <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#86:1:A>
For piping and processing you can use Tracer to trace all the
piping facilities or piping network into AutoCAD format

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#87:1:A>
You can use this uh <.> s </.> what we call the schematic file <?>
grains </?> later for network analysis <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#88:1:A>
For mapping conversion you know for GIS system the the most tedious
thing is to do the data conversion that is to convert existing maps into uh
digital format

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#89:1:A>
And Tracer is the perfect partner to perform this <,> because most
of the uh conversion <unc> three words </unc> using Tracer for this
process instead of using the <.> di </.> the <?> manual </?> digitizer <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#90:1:A>
Okay the trip the history the history of Tracer <,>
#> Tracer was announced uh in the nineteen ninety three

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#91:1:A>
The first version is called the CAD <unc> one-word </unc>
Tracer

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#92:1:A>
And then it develop uh other uhm versions we are called the
Recognizer the Tracer the Recognizer release one point one and also the
Tracer for Window and also <,> <unc> two words </unc> Tracer to
support the color and <unc> two words </unc> uh raster image

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#93:1:A>
Uhm and that  ' s all for the presentations

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#94:1:A>
We  ' ll go through the uh demonstration

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#95:1:A>
Uh

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#96:1:A>
Uh Future Solution is the sole distributor of Tracer in Hong Kong
as well as in China

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#97:1:A>
If you are interested in these products you can contact us later
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#98:1:A>
So let  ' s demonstrate the function of Tracer <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#99:1:A>
What we  ' ll see is the <unc> one-word </unc> environment

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#100:1:A>
What we are going to do is to load the raster image into this
environment <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#101:1:A>
The process is very simple

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#102:1:A>
It  ' s just like uh loading uh uh ordinary AutoCAD drawings

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#103:1:A>
On the excuse me <,,> on the upper right corner uh this  ' s the
Tracer menu

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#104:1:A>
The Tracer <?> mainly </?> occupy uh one menu in the AutoCAD
environment

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#105:1:A>
The Tracer provide you functions to do the uh I/Os to do the
editing and also to do the tracing or do the conversion <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#106:1:A>
Ok

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#107:1:A>
Let  ' s see the raster image

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#108:1:A>
On the screen it  ' s a A three size uh maps <,> in Hong Kong area

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#109:1:A>
Tracer provide you <,,> I think you cannot see it very clearly so
we change the color to to brighter one

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#110:1:A>
Tracer provides you functions to handle those raster image on the
screen such as to hang in around or to zoom in <,> zoom in <?> in zoomer rate
</?> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#111:1:A>
Also this map is in the resolution of this map is uh three hundred
dots per inch

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#112:1:A>
It it occupies six megabytes of memory

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#113:1:A>
What we are going to do now is to use a process called uhm noise
removal

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#114:1:A>
You see there  ' s sometimes dots uh in the screen

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#115:1:A>
Those dots uh we call it noise

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#116:1:A>
Tracer provides you a function to remove all these noise <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#117:1:A>
So we select uh rectangle area for noise and then <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#118:1:A>
You see

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#119:1:A>
The noise is removed <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#120:1:A>
So after the noise removal we can go into more details

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#121:1:A>
<.> Rig </.> Right now we want to <.> pro </.> we we want to
demonstrate some raster editing function

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#122:1:A>
As on the screen there is two building blocks the block thirty
four and the block thirty five

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#123:1:A>
What we are going to do is to demolish these two blocks and then
replace it it with the block uh red here

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#124:1:A>
So we use the functions called raster <.> e </.> erase to erase
those blocks

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#125:1:A>
There are many approaches to erase the block

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#126:1:A>
First one you can use the polygon area to define the area of
interest

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#127:1:A>
And then it <.> wi </.> it will erase the area inside the polygon

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#128:1:A>
Uhm just click on the raster object

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#129:1:A>
Or you can use a rubber as you as you see in on the screen you can
control the size of the rubber to rub it out <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#130:1:A>
Or use another method is to click on the raster object and it will
be erased completely <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#131:1:A>
After erasing the next step we are going to do is to copy this
block this block to this area

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#132:1:A>
There  ' s many approach to do it <?> but </?> we choose

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#133:1:A>
First of all we convert this raster <?> red </?> block into <?>
bracket </?> and then copy the <.> brac </.> <?> bracket </?> image from here
to here

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#134:1:A>
Mark that mark we going to be tracing because it  ' s

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#135:1:A>
We just click on the objects and on the on screen you can see the
red lines <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#136:1:A>
So when the Tracer comes across an intersection point it will ask
the user which way to go something like that

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#137:1:A>
You can choose the direction and then after you define the
direction you can continue the Tracer <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#138:1:A>
So after that you we will convert into a AutoCAD drawing lines

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#139:1:A>
So we can move the <unc> two words </unc> now <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#140:1:A>
So <?> configure image </?> <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#141:1:A>
Also you can copy besides copying the beside tracing the raster
image into <unc> one-word </unc> we can copy the raster image
directly <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#142:1:A>
We can define the polygons <,> to include the raster image <,> and
then move the raster image within that polygon <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#143:1:A>
And the operation is very simple <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#144:1:A>
Right now we are going to move another raster image

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#145:1:A>
Beside direct copying we can also rotate the raster image or scan
it up or down

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#146:1:A>
But first we want to move this drawing <,> to another new area
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#147:1:A>
This time we we rotate ninety degree and also scan it or use it
and also scan it up two times

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#148:1:A>
As you see this is the new raster image <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#149:1:A>
Beside tracing straight line you can also use it to trace uhm <,>
curve line <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#150:1:A>
You just get on the line we are going to trace and then the
tracing will start automatically

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#151:1:A>
As we see on the screen it  ' s very fast and accurate <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#152:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#153:1:A>
And finished

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#154:1:A>
It just takes less than one second to trace a <,> curve line <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#155:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#156:1:A>
The green line is the <?> polyline </?> traced from the raster
image <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#157:1:A>
The beauty of Tracer is to allow users to config the behavior of
Tracer <,> because uhm for each type of <.> straigh </.> of uh tracing there  ' s
uh some parameters to define the <.> pe </.> the behavior

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#158:1:A>
The first <?> stroke </?> is to define the target traced image

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#159:1:A>
That is the route of the traced line and also the gap and the step

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#160:1:A>
And the second is the flow it is the flow of tracing

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#161:1:A>
That is you can define it to stop at intersection or you can uh
use the default value to straight through any intersection or turn right or
turn left <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#162:1:A>
The third one is the uh adjustment of the outcome line

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#163:1:A>
You can control the <unc> one-word </unc> factors of the
outcome

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#164:1:A>
Such as for a very straight line you can use a line rate for
straightening factor or for the curve line you can use a smaller <?> rate
</?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#165:1:A>
Then more control import will be produced <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#166:1:A>
Also you can control the attributes of the uh outcoming lines

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#167:1:A>
That is the color the layers also the line <?> time </?> <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#168:1:A>
All those parameters can be saved <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#169:1:A>
Beside <?> interactive </?> line tracing there is a process called
Recognition

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#170:1:A>
So we define the areas to do the recognition <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#171:1:A>
Also for recognition we can define different parameters set <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#172:1:A>
So we can we define the rectangle area and start the recognition
process <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-055#173:1:A>
And the process is pretty fast when compared to other software
package in the market </I>
