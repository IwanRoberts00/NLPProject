<ICE-HK:S2A-012#1:1:A>
Well a very good evening welcome to the Macau Jockey Club  ' s
Taipo racecourse <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#2:1:A>
once again we have uh sand racing this evening ten races on the sand
surface the going <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#3:1:A>
normal watering and runners behind the barriers for race number two
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#4:1:A>
this is the Roscommon Handicap class six gallopers over fifteen
hundred metres <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#5:1:A>
and favourite throughout number five <,> Fruitful Always <,> just
ahead of number four Beautiful Dancer <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#6:1:A>
Uh just quickly our commentators selections for this second event we
will bring you a replay of race one in around fifteen minutes time <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#7:1:A>
Franko Lau in race two likes four five six <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#8:1:A>
Beautiful Dancer to defeat Fruitful Always and Siu Yik <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#9:1:A>
Harry Troy has gone the way of one Universe to defeat five Fruitful
Always and six Siu Yik as we get the blue light <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#10:1:A>
I  ' ve gone the way of uh five Fruitful Always very unlucky two
starts back <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#11:1:A>
and then performed pretty well last time had his chance but again I
think must be considered the top three banker in the race number five
Fruitful Always <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#12:1:A>
one Universe I think is the danger very well graded I would have
tipped him on top but he is only a a small type only weighing around nine
hundred and fifty pounds carrying a big weight one thirty two pounds so <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#13:1:A>
on that score I  ' ve had to put him second just because of the big
weight and he  ' s only a lightly framed horse <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#14:1:A>
and I thought the value in the race was number nine House Of
Fortunes <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#15:1:A>
he is coming into the race fit where a few of these are coming in
first up for the season <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#16:1:A>
and I thought his past couple of runs haven't been too bad and uh I
think he  ' s uh one of value that can actually figure in his race so I  ' m
going five one and nine <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#17:1:A>
Uh Siu Yik <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#18:1:A>
a lot of support for him first up for the season I thought he would
just improve a touch with the run <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#19:1:A>
there  ' s no doubt he  ' s coming in with a little bit of improvement
in him <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#20:1:A>
quickly I  ' ll go through the changes for tonight  ' s programme in
the first Really Clear was out replaced by the second standby Sunny  ' s Legend
barrier ten and Danny Beasley rode <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#21:1:A>
think uh the Danny Beasley factor also sees uh number six Siu Yik
very short in this event coming up <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#22:1:A>
no changes in race two in the third number six Preston is out no
replacement race six number six Preston <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#23:1:A>
race four is clear in race five take out number one Full Steam he  ' s
replaced by the first stand Best Come barrier eleven and Ricky Lei takes that
ride <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#24:1:A>
one changes in race six <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#25:1:A>
in the seventh we have a riding change number three Evolution K S
Lei takes over from the suspended Jackie Yip <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#26:1:A>
race eight and nine are clear of changes <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#27:1:A>
and in fact so is race ten so that brings you up to date with all
the changes for tonight  ' s programme <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#28:1:A>
For this second event it  ' s twenty nine fifty <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#29:1:A>
in fact now sorry thirty dollars for number five uh Fruitful Always
Beautiful Dancer <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#30:1:A>
he  ' s been solid throughout on thirty four fifty <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#31:1:A>
fifty five dollars for Siu Yik Universe was a double figure quote
earlier <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#32:1:A>
he  ' s down to seventy dollars and number nine House Of Fortune is
around from twenty five down to fifteen <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#33:1:A>
so he  ' s just being specked a little <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#34:1:A>
We  ' ll be joined later on by Franko Lau I  ' m the captain Steve
Mooney we now get the red light for race number two as we cross over to Harry
Troy I like the chances of five one and nine <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-012#35:1:B>
Thanks Steve and a very good evening everyone as the runners
start to load for the second of the night <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#36:1:B>
favourite throughout has been Fruitful Always <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#37:1:B>
good effort last start <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#38:1:B>
a little support for the top weight Universe <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#39:1:B>
and well supported has been number four Beautiful Dancer and
likewise Siu Yik <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#40:1:B>
number six the mount of Danny Beasley now a little bit restless in
gate four is Explorer <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#41:1:B>
They  ' re off and running <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#42:1:B>
came out okay Explorer slow into stride was Money Come in the early
part it  ' s Universe striding forward to take up the running <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#43:1:B>
booting up on the inside there to go with him is his stable mate
Beautiful Dancer <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#44:1:B>
a little bit deep Best Tiger right on the backs of them House Of
Fortune  ' s not too far away Fruitful Always <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#45:1:B>
followed then by Money Come he  ' s recovered he  ' s midfield the
rails to his outside Explorer <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#46:1:B>
followed then by Siu Yik as they go by the twelve hundred <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#47:1:B>
drifting back was Rapid Stride and Victory Together is the tail
ender <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#48:1:B>
into the back we  ' ve got a line of three on the lead and it  ' s
Beautiful Dancer just showing out a narrow leader from three deep Money Come
Universe with the seat in the centre of them <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#49:1:B>
followed then by Fruitful Always going forward and he  ' s going to
be prominent <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#50:1:B>
on the back of them House Of Fortunes travelling well <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#51:1:B>
followed then by Siu Yik in the lime cap going forward but a little
bit deep Rapid Stride as they go by the seven hundred <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#52:1:B>
followed then by one taking off from the back and that was uh uh
Explorer followed then by Money Come and he  ' s starting to drop back now
Money Come <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#53:1:B>
and Victory Together is the tail ender <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#54:1:B>
five hundred metres out we  ' ve got a line of three on the lead <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#55:1:B>
we  ' ve got Beautiful Dancer in the centre Money Come and crowded a
bit deep on the outside is Fruitful Always <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#56:1:B>
followed then by Universe just behind them a little bit deep Siu
Yik and House Of Fortune  ' s right there they straighten for the run in <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#57:1:B>
in front Beautiful Dancer a little bit tight for Best Tiger
Fruitful Always raced up now and took the lead away <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#58:1:B>
running on fairly well Universe but Fruitful Always inside the
final two hundred dashed away <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#59:1:B>
Fruitful Always nicely clear from Beautiful Dancer <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#60:1:B>
running on Universe when the race is all over but nicely clear
Fruitful Always and kept going by Robbie Burke he  ' s going to take it the
prize Fruitful Always first <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#61:1:B>
it  ' s going to be close for second Beautiful Dancer just in advance
of House Of Fortune <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#62:1:B>
close up Universe <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#63:1:B>
followed then by Explorer then came Siu Yik Money Come Best Tiger
did weaken away he  ' s finished near the tail of the field and just forward of
him was Rapid Stride with Victory Together <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#64:1:B>
And we straighten up for the run in and it was Beautiful dancer in
front but taken on very quickly by the favourite Fruitful Always <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#65:1:B>
running on well Universe oh checked out of it there House Of
Fortunes <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#66:1:B>
now he  ' s in a photo for second and he was checked out of it by
Beautiful dancer so you  ' ll hear more of this <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#67:1:B>
Universe running on just fairly down the outside <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#68:1:B>
and not too far away Siu Yik who just seemed to run out of
condition over the final stages <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#69:1:B>
but a nice ride and an easy win to number five Fruitful Always <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#70:1:B>
got on the speed pretty early was on a line of three when they
straightened up and he takes the prize <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#71:1:B>
now it  ' s pretty close for second Beautiful Dancer <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#72:1:B>
and House Of Fortunes and House Of Fortunes badly inconvenienced so
great chance of reversing that they do have the enquiry sign up already <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#73:1:B>
it  ' s five four nine and one as they stand and the winner number
five Fruitful Always a five year old Bay Irish bred by Ezzoud from Adacama
and Robbie Burke riding for P K Wong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#74:1:B>
and Number nine House Of Fortunes is second <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#75:1:B>
uh rather number four Beautiful Dancer is second for the moment <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#76:1:B>
Peter Lau for Stephen Leung <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#77:1:B>
and number nine House Of Fortunes in third Francie Naude for
William Lai officially fourth number one <,> Universe <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#78:1:B>
so that  ' s five four nine and one after the running of race number
two <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#79:1:B>
and no doubt you  ' ll hear a little more about the incident inside
the final two hundred <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-012#80:1:A>
I just wonder because uh Beautiful Dancer was always holding
that rails position <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#81:1:A>
and House Of Fortunes was getting that run behind him I just wonder
if he was just always holding his ground uh <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#82:1:A>
Beautiful Dancer rather than uh House Of Fortunes being
inconvenienced <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#83:1:A>
there was probably never even a run there I think but uh the
stewards will probably sort that out of course <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#84:1:A>
five four nine the numbers that count but obviously an enquiry due
to the fact that uh House of Fortunes did have to check at around the one
hundred and fifty metre mark <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#85:1:A>
Race three tonight is the Listowel Handicap class Five gallopers
Preston is out no replacements <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#86:1:A>
the early favourite is the topee <,> Super Transformer <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#87:1:A>
now let  ' s have a look at this as you can see he is always hard up
against the fence here uh Beautiful Dancer so I really doubt there was
actually ever any room there <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-012#88:1:B>
Steve that  ' s a that  ' s a little bit late there was definitely
room for him uh that  ' s a that  ' s a mile too late <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#89:1:B>
and he was badly inconvenienced so <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-012#90:1:A>
He  ' s definitely he  ' s definitely had to check there  ' s no
doubt about that <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-012#91:1:B>
Yip yip that  ' s a that  ' s a good way too late he was away from
the rail and <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#92:1:B>
there was room for him and he started to sneak up from about
shortly after they straightened so <,> it  ' s a shame we just can't get ah ah
another look at that from ah a bit further <,> back to the top of the
straight <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-012#93:1:A>
So five four nine are the numbers we  ' re just trying to try
and sort out that uh <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#94:1:A>
try and get that uh head on replay a little further back but
unfortunately we  ' re running out of time we have to go to a commercial break
so <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#95:1:A>
five four nine are the numbers as they stand at the moment <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#96:1:A>
one thirty eight point three is the run time <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#97:1:A>
<&> Commercial Break </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-012#98:1:A>
Welcome back live to Taipo racecourse we bring you the news
that there is an objection uh at this stage obviously it looks to be third
against second House of Fortunes <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#99:1:A>
uh against Beautiful Dancer five four and nine across the line <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#100:1:A>
and hopefully we  ' ll be able to bring you another uh replay of
that head on shot which saw uh House Of Fortunes lose quite a bit of ground
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#101:1:A>
the question is if the run was there we  ' ll he should be getting
that second position <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#102:1:A>
but we  ' ll just uh <,> hopefully see that head on replay in a
minute <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#103:1:A>
they ran one thirty eight point three <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#104:1:A>
the winner should be safe Tony Wong and Robbie Burke with Fruitful
Always <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#105:1:A>
and it is third against second just confirming as you can see on
your screens <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#106:1:A>
officially fourth was number one Universe <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#107:1:A>
so the favourite winning the second <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#108:1:A>
good ride too by Robbie Burke <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#109:1:A>
and now just awaiting these replays to give us an idea of whether
this objection will be successful <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#110:1:A>
it  ' s all counting on if the run was there because if it was there
it  ' s certainly uh lost uh quite a bit ground probably uh well over a length
and <,> being only a short head between the second and third horse <,> it  ' d
have to be a big hope <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#111:1:A>
But first of all we  ' ll need to have another look now here uh this
will give us a good idea <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#112:1:A>
now you can see Beautiful Dancer in the orange cap <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#113:1:A>
at this stage he  ' s travelling behind Beautiful Dancer who  ' s on
the fence in the white cap <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#114:1:A>
and on the outside of Beautiful Dancer here is Best Tiger now as
they turn for home <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-012#115:1:A>
you can see he does uh roll off half a horse here uh Beautiful
Dancer Peter Lau <,> </I>
