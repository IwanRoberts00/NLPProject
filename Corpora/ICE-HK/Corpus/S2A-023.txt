<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-023#1:1:A>
Now uh accounting education in China and accounting education
in Hong Kong there are differences as well as similarities <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#2:1:A>
Now similarities first

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#3:1:A>
We study accountancy they also study accountancy <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#4:1:A>
But within accountancy there are differences

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#5:1:A>
Uh I I don't want to <.> s </.> uh say what what our accountancy is
because you your you know very well

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#6:1:A>
Now accountancy in China uh when they study accountancy they really
study uh several systems

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#7:1:A>
For example they study the state own uh enterprises system <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#8:1:A>
And they study the joint venture system

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#9:1:A>
They also study the hundred percent hundred percent foreign
enterprises

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#10:1:A>
And they also study Western accounting system <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#11:1:A>
In other words they understand us because <.> the </.> they do uh
they do study Western accounting

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#12:1:A>
But in Hong Kong we don't understand them

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#13:1:A>
We are beginning to understand them but we don't <?> use to </?> 
understand them because we don't study their system <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#14:1:A>
And so that this accountancy

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#15:1:A>
They also study auditing but of course the the content auditing
would be different that would be uh beside their their topic today

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#16:1:A>
They also study uh economics law et cetera all supporting subjects
 <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#17:1:A>
Uhm <,,> of course uh <.> i </.> in their uh uh uh they also have
uh have degrees in accountancy

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#18:1:A>
But in a degree they don't have project

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#19:1:A>
They don't study research <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#20:1:A>
They have research and project for their uh higher uh uh degree
study

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#21:1:A>
They call it uh research institute

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#22:1:A>
And the uh and the award will be uh Master Degree

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#23:1:A>
So their project and research are confined to the higher degree in
the in the research institute <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#24:1:A>
And they don't prepare their student for professional examinations

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#25:1:A>
Of course uh in Hong Kong we used to uh in Hong Kong we used to uh
when we were <.> s </.> uh in the PD uh uh era we will we prepare our student
for professional examination

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#26:1:A>
But now we don't

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#27:1:A>
But there are still other institutes

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#28:1:A>
Teaching institutions preparing the students for for <?> 
professional </?> examinations

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#29:1:A>
Because in China they don't have professional examination stage one
stage two et cetera

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#30:1:A>
If you want to be a CPA uh uh you you must be an accountant first
 <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#31:1:A>
And of course <.> er </.> because they do not have professional
examinations uh as we have therefore they do not have professional ethics in
their curriculum <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#32:1:A>
They also uh <,> they don't study accounting standard because they
 <.> don </.> they have no standards <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#33:1:A>
They have produced a draft of standards but which has not been uh
promulgated yet

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#34:1:A>
So most probably next year onward they will have hopefully have the
first standard <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#35:1:A>
I have already got a draft with the <.> stan </.> uh the proposed
standard which is uh which uh very similar to international uh accounting
standard

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#36:1:A>
In in fact in many aspect are similar to uh uh international
accounting standard <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#37:1:A>
And <,> I think uh as far as uh university uh education is concern
 <,> they are quite similar

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#38:1:A>
They have also uh three years and they and they call it uh
professionalism courses  <indig> Wui Gai Chuen Yip </indig> accounting
accounting professionalism

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#39:1:A>
 <indig> Wui Gai Chuen Yip </indig> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#40:1:A>
Uh we call it professional we can call it a professional uh a
course of of professional uh uh diploma something like that <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#41:1:A>
So uh it depends the university will award a degree and the and the
colleges will award a diploma professional diploma

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#42:1:A>
They call it a <indig> Chuen Yip Mun Pung </indig> in accountancy
 <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#43:1:A>
And uhm they in uh inside their uh university or colleges they do
not have tutorials do not have seminar

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#44:1:A>
They only have lectures classes <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#45:1:A>
And uh their lecturers and professors uh will lecture the students
 <.> m </.> uh very much the same as we do here <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#46:1:A>
So uh as far as uh accounting education is concern <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#47:1:A>
You see uh the the uh accountancy in fact in China has been
developing uh only uh in the past uh ten or uh ten years or so so there are
rapid changes in fact in the curriculum as well as in the course structures
 <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#48:1:A>
Now after after <.> mo </.> uh probably next year after uh China
has its own standard and also uh auditing uh guideline et cetera

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#49:1:A>
At present uh China has not yet a formal any formal uh auditing
standard nor uh auditing guideline <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#50:1:A>
In fact in China accounting taxation auditing are regarded as
separate specialisms

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#51:1:A>
Here we combine them all

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#52:1:A>
Here a professional accountant must be an accountant a tax
consultant and an auditor

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#53:1:A>
But in China it  ' s not

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#54:1:A>
So in China when you uh take on take <.> o </.> take on an
accountancy degree you may not study taxation

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#55:1:A>
Auditing they do study auditing

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#56:1:A>
But as I said uh there are still not yet any auditing standard nor
uh nor uh auditing guideline so the auditing contents are very much uh at the
discretion of the university authority <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#57:1:A>
And after uh graduation they go into the accountancy uh career <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#58:1:A>
And the later on <.> t t </.> they uh <.> i i </.> in here our
graduates will try to uh complete the professional examination uh in one two
three years  '  time and become a <.> se </.> and and and hold a professional
qualification

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#59:1:A>
But in China you cannot

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#60:1:A>
You have to wait a long time

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#61:1:A>
You got to have many many years of experience before you can be
admitted uh to the professional body and become an professional accountant

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#62:1:A>
They call it in Chinese <O> Cantonese-word-for-accountant
 </O> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#63:1:A>
 <indig> Wui Gnai Si </indig> is is equivalent to our professional
examination

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#64:1:A>
In fact they uh <,> uh there are <indig> Wui Gnai Si

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#65:1:A>
Go Cup Wui Gnai Si

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#66:1:A>
Wui Gnai Ngan Yuen </indig> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#67:1:A>
There  ' re there  ' re three grades

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#68:1:A>
And a university uh uh graduate after many years of experience can
be admitted to uh professional uh accountant <indig> Wui Gnai Si </indig> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#69:1:A>
And then after twenty years or so he may be elected uh to be a
senior accountant <indig> Go Cup Wui Gnai Si </indig>  <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#70:1:A>
And <,> I think I think uh I have I I have I have said enough about
the the differences and <.> simi </.> similarities between the accounting
education in China and in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#71:1:A>
But my opinion or my view is that uh when <.> Ch </.> China is
changing

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#72:1:A>
In fact China <.> i </.> is not many things are uncertain many
things are not steady

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#73:1:A>
They are changing almost <.> dai </.> uh from day to day

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#74:1:A>
So uh any system today may be different tomorrow in fact

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#75:1:A>
It  ' s not like uh Hong Kong we are <.> w </.> well established

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#76:1:A>
They are not well established

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#77:1:A>
They are changing

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#78:1:A>
So in the future the way I see it is that uh China accounting
education will become more and more uh like Western

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#79:1:A>
There will still be differences but there will be more similarities
between uh China and the rest <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#80:1:A>
Thank you </I> 


<I> 

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-023#81:2:A>
I think there  ' re a lot of way we can help uh our counterparts
in China

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#82:2:A>
For example uh the accountancy department or City Polytechnic has
recently sign up agreement with a number of universities in China uh whereby
we exchange accounting personnel

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#83:2:A>
We exchange accounting uh teaching material

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#84:2:A>
We cooperate in the accounting research et cetera

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#85:2:A>
So each year we plan to send our staff into their universities to
give a short uh lecture as uh on a short term basis

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#86:2:A>
And also they they also send their own staff to our institute uh to
do some short term teaching and research

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#87:2:A>
So that is one way to start uh uh cooperating between the two
places and and and to enhance a mutual understanding between uh the two
places </I> 


<I> 

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-023#88:3:A>
Mrs Chow can I ask a question

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#89:3:A>
Ask uh uh other speaker

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#90:3:A>
I think <.> Ch </.> China is considering uh producing its own
accounting standards

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#91:3:A>
Now when the standards are produced and promulgated will China uh
cancel or wash out or or annul the existing accounting regulations

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#92:3:A>
In other words will their standard replace their regulations

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#93:3:A>
 <&> Chairlady repeats the question and speaker A adds the following
 </&> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#94:3:A>
Or they or they uh would co-exist <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#95:3:A>
I I don't think there  ' s any definite answer but I like to <.> se
 </.> the views of the other speakers

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#96:3:A>
What what are their guess </I> 


<I> 

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-023#97:4:A>
I think China would very much like to uh bring their
accounting standard in line with the international standards

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#98:4:A>
And that  ' s why they are very eager to join international
accountants affiliations which is the uh Hong Kong Society is actually doing
very much to help them joining such international accounting federations

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#99:4:A>
And also if you spend some time to uh read their accountancy
journal I mean the the Chinese Accountancy Journal <.> w </.> there are a lot
of topics about <?> harmonization </?> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#100:4:A>
However given the current situation current uh <.> profoun </.> 
political environment in China some of the accounting standards cannot be
modified or cannot be changed overnight

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#101:4:A>
I believe if the uh open door policy continue in China and the uhm
the social systems been changed and the accounting standard or accounting
rule must follow

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#102:4:A>
And also will bring them in line with international standard

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#103:4:A>
Would you agree uh Aloysius </I> 


<I> 

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-023#104:5:A>
If you want me to say yes I will say that

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#105:5:A>
Uh basically I think uh we uh we  ' ve heard a lot about saying the
lack of accounting standards

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#106:5:A>
I think I think the PRC officials mainly the Ministry of Finance
is extremely aware of that

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#107:5:A>
And I was uh given to understand that they have now translated all
the thirty one <.> i i </.> international accounting standards into Chinese
for their own reference

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#108:5:A>
And <,> the the thing is if you look at the accounting law they
will say or even in in uh in the memorandum <.> the </.> they will always
have a section on on on on on books of accounts and accounting practices

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#109:5:A>
And if you invariably you will find this phrasing uh will follow
international accounting practices and which to me means that sooner or later
they will have to address the issue on an international on international
accounting standards

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#110:5:A>
And uh okay China at the moment uh there are still some problems
in in uh not not problems there are still certain restrictions whereby
certain uhm uh SSAPs or <.> I </.> IAS cannot apply

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#111:5:A>
But sooner or later if they want to move out and if they want to
attract international investment they will have to comply

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#112:5:A>
And one one simple <.> e </.> example is that uhm recently you  ' ve
heard you  ' ve all heard about the issue of B shares <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#113:5:A>
In the issue of A shares A shares are the shares which uh the
local PRC nationals can apply

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#114:5:A>
And they will always have their own accounting standards i e all
the all the records are prepared in such a way that they comply with all the
regulations and all the uh internal uh promulgations

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#115:5:A>
Now when they issue B shares one of the exercises uh that the
accountant international firm accountant does now these days is to translate
those into international accounting standard or or or international accepted
uh uh figures

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#116:5:A>
Uhm it uh my personal experience is that uh in general they do
tend to follow because basically uh at the moment when most people issue
their A shares they always have the B shares in mind

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#117:5:A>
Therefore they will try to adjust initially uh to comply with
international standards

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#118:5:A>
Uh whether or not the international standards when they are
promulgated when they are actually adopted or the accounting standards in
China when they are actually adopted will uh will uh replace the regulations
my personal view is that they may not because basically the accounting
regulations are regulating the uh not uh the accounting profession as well as
the proper books of records et cetera is quite uh similar to uh uh
miniaturized uh company law uh applicable to the individual <.> in </.> 
entity

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#119:5:A>
Uh also as Charles earlier on said that every single company has
its has its own constitution i e the memorandum and articles of association
which are broadly in line with the accounting law

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#120:5:A>
So therefore the I don't see uh accounting standards replacing the
regulations in the near future </I> 


<I> 

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-023#121:6:A>
Maybe I want to add something

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#122:6:A>
We heard that ShenZhen want to uh uh adopt the company law Hong
Kong company law in its Special Economic Zone

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#123:6:A>
And we also heard that they should should have been effected for
ages but it  ' s still in a draft form

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#124:6:A>
I haven't seen the final draft but still in a draft form

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#125:6:A>
We just returned from Shanghai and this time we heard another
story

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#126:6:A>
Shanghai has their own company law and will be the first draft
again

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#127:6:A>
Uh would they would there be uhm some sort of company law
applicable to the whole country

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#128:6:A>
We don't know

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#129:6:A>
But we guess there may be some laws applicable to a region

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#130:6:A>
Uh some some laws in in uh ShenZhen some laws in uh Shanghai
something like that

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#131:6:A>
It  ' s interesting </I> 


<I> 

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-023#132:7:A>
As I said <&> interrupted by chairlady </&> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#133:7:A>
As I said I haven't seen that the uh the law so I I don't know
what the differences are

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#134:7:A>
But uh for example the stock exchange in in Shanghai and in
ShenZhen their own listing requirements are different

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#135:7:A>
Slightly different

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#136:7:A>
Although they are not uh very much but at least there are some
differences

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#137:7:A>
This is quite uh annoying to the foreigners because they are very
close established very close states

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#138:7:A>
How come they have different sets of listing requirement

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#139:7:A>
We we can't answer that </I> 


<I> 

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-023#140:8:A>
It maybe that they empower the uh Special Economic Zone  ' s
officials to have more free hand to run their own region

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#141:8:A>
Uh and therefore some of the enterprises in ShenZhen they adopt
another sets of accounting systems

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#142:8:A>
What they call uh accounting systems for the Special Economic Zone
ShenZhen something like that

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#143:8:A>
And under which they can provide for doubtful debts

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#144:8:A>
It  ' s interesting

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#145:8:A>
Uhm whereas in Shanghai it  ' s still not allowed to provide for
even for a specific provision

<ICE-HK:S2A-023#146:8:A>
So there are differences </I>
