Thank you for your letters dated July 17th and 23rd , 1991
informing me of your displeasure on your room booking in Beijing through our
Reservation office . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-027#31:2>
I have conducted an investigation into the issue to ascertain the
discrepancies of the two different room rates quoted to you . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-027#32:2>
Our Reservations staff did at the time of your first query
indicate to you that she has to reconfirm with hotel beijing toronto on the
actual rate and then to come back to you after communicating with Beijing ,
subsequent to which she quoted US&dollar;60 per single room per night . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-027#33:2>
We deeply regret the confusion , and sincerely hope that this
will not deter you from future patronage with nikko hotels international .

Greetings from hotel nikko hongkong !

<p>

We have great pleasure to inform you that our Hotel has won the
8th Bols Bartender Competition , and our Bartender Mr Lego WONG Chi-wai has
been awarded this victory as a Champion among 62 contestants of different
hotels in Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-027#96:5>
Lego created his own unique cocktail &ldquo; Flying Colours
&rdquo; which truly demonstrated his professional skill and talent in
concocting new and fascinating cocktails .

<ICE-HK:W1B-027#97:5>
The judges panel remarked that the cocktail not only has a refreshing
taste and green colour of the summer drink but also with Lego  ' s choice of
name . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-027#98:5>
Since we listed &ldquo; Flying Colours &rdquo; together with our
promoted summer cocktails , it has been very well received by public .

<ICE-HK:W1B-027#99:5>
We think that it would be recommending to share this cocktail among
NHI hotels , we take this opportunity to enclose a photograph of &ldquo;
Flying Colours &rdquo; as well as its original recipes which you might be
appreciative for such introduction . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-027#100:5>
Lego  ' s original recipe of Bols Melon Liqueur and Orange Curacao
blended with Gordan  ' s Gin , Fresh Lemon Juice , Syrup and Egg White
garnished with &ldquo; cherry &rdquo; mint and <-> pinapple </-> <+>
pineapple </+> beautifully cut into the shape of a dove . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-027#101:5>
I am sure that you may find our champion cocktail a refreshing
one after you have made one for yourse1f , and so as your guests .
