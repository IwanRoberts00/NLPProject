<ICE-HK:S2B-028#1:1:A>
Few will disagree with the Education Commission  ' s observation
<,> in its recently publish report number six <,> that a comprehensive
strategy must be develop to enhance the proficiency of Chinese and English
<,> of young people in Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#2:1:A>
Otherwise our workforce will quickly lose its competitiveness <,> in
the Asia-Pacific region <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#3:1:A>
Many will also welcome the thirty-eight proposals <,> set out in the
report <,> aimed at enhancing language proficiency <,> and calling for
substantial amounts of new resources <,> for language education <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#4:1:A>
Before deciding to spend more on <.> ed </.> on language education
however <,> we should take a hard look <,> at the outcome of what has already
been spent <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#5:1:A>
For <?> if </?> the importance of Chinese language skills has only
been recognised recently <,> the same is not true for English <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#6:1:A>
A child in Hong Kong begins learning English <,> in kindergarten <,>
at the age of four <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#7:1:A>
In primary and secondary school <,> English language is a subject
that takes up the largest number of teaching hours <,> exceeding Chinese or
Mathematics <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#8:1:A>
By the time a student leaves school <,> he or she will have spent
more time learning English <,> than it takes a university undergraduate <,>
to work for a degree <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#9:1:A>
In addition <,> for over eighty-five percent of the secondary school
population <,> who learn the science and humanities in English <,> a large of
proportion of their work on these subjects is actually tackling language
problems <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#10:1:A>
Our youngsters attend remedial English <.> cla </.> classes <,> in
the school and outside <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#11:1:A>
The British Council has been doing a lucrative business <,>
providing English courses for students who should be learning the language
<,> in their own school <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#12:1:A>
Veteran English teachers quit their school job <,> to run tutorial
classes <,> of outrageous sizes and charging exorbitant fees <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#13:1:A>
English learning programs are broadcast <,> regularly by radio and
television <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#14:1:A>
Chinese newspapers carry English columns <,> bilingual sections <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#15:1:A>
Bookshops fill their shelves with books <,> tapes videos and
electronic devices <,> that purport to help people achieve <,> what they have
failed to do in school <,> namely to learn English <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#16:1:A>
A visitor from outside <,> who notices this thriving business in
English language education <,> will easily think that the Hong Kong
population has the highest English standard in the world of non-native
speakers <,,> until he tries to communicate in English <,> with someone in
the street <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#17:1:A>
Local people <,> specially employers and admission officers of the
tertiary institutions <,> are despondently aware of the <.> de </.>
deficiency in English language skills <,> of our school leavers <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#18:1:A>
The worst problem <,> with the English language education in Hong
Kong <,> is not this poor results <,,> but the inestimable amount of
resources it has expended to obtain such results <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#19:1:A>
So much has been done in teaching and learning English <,> and so
little has been achieved <,> in relation to the resources expended <,> that
there must be some fundamental mistake <,> in the way of doing things here
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#20:1:A>
The Education Commission identifies a number of factors that have
<.> contri </.> contributed to Hong Kong  ' s long-lasting language proficiency
problems <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#21:1:A>
These include a lack of a coherent framework for planning and
implementing language policies in education <,> ill-informed attitude towards
languages <,> inadequate education for teachers <,> out-dated curriculum
design <,> and inadequate support infrastructure for schools and teachers
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#22:1:A>
The shortage of properly trained teachers may be a problem more
acute for languages <,> especially for English <,> than for other school
subjects <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#23:1:A>
As mentioned in the report <,> people who have received academic
and professional training in the English language <,> have a wide choice of
careers and are seldom attracted to the teaching profession <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#24:1:A>
Problems in education and administration and curriculum planning
<,> suggested in the report the obstacles to enhancing language proficiency
<,> are less convincing <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#25:1:A>
It is difficult to believe that in the past <,> Hong Kong has done
much more poorly in the languages <,> than in other areas of the school
curriculum <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#26:1:A>
There has been no lack of research in curriculum innovations in
language education for example <,> compared with similar work for other
subjects <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#27:1:A>
The report mentions ill-informed attitude towards languages <,>
unfortunately without elaborating <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#28:1:A>
In fact it appears some of these ill-informed attitudes are
preventing the Education Commission from making correct judgements <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#29:1:A>
The biggest mistake in our language education I believe <,> is to
teach English as if it were a second popular language <,> in the territory
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#30:1:A>
Compared with other colonial powers <,> the British have been
particularly successful <,> in propagating their language and culture <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#31:1:A>
In many places which were formerly British colonies <,> English in
not only constitutionally designated as an official language <,> but it  ' s
also widely used at home and at school at work <,> and on social occasions
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#32:1:A>
The children in these places <,> learn English <,> as their second
<,> or even their first language <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#33:1:A>
Hong Kong <,> is a remarkable exception <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#34:1:A>
English has never been a second language here <,,> and it is most
unlikely that it would ever be <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#35:1:A>
The average Hong Kong Chinese <,> seldom listens to an English
radio channel <,> or watches a TV programme in English <,> without Chinese
sub-titles <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#36:1:A>
He does not speak English to other members of his family <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#37:1:A>
Although he may have to deal with English documents in his office
<,> when he converses with his Chinese colleagues <,> he will use at most a
mixed code sparsely sprinkled to English <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#38:1:A>
To all intent and purposes <,> English remains a foreign language
in Hong Kong <,> important in education and at work <,> little used otherwise
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#39:1:A>
Perhaps rather unexpectedly <,> the growth in our affluence has
further reduced <,> the chance of necessary exposure to English in our
everyday life <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#40:1:A>
The abundance of local <,> productions means that people no longer
need to understand English to enjoy reading <,> watching television <,> going
to the cinema or attending pop concerts <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#41:1:A>
Teachers find it more and more difficult <,> to think of genuine
situations that will convince their children <,> of the need to learn to
communicate in English <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#42:1:A>
Yet our language educators keep on deceiving themselves <,> about
the status of the language in our community <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#43:1:A>
They set objectives demanding that our students should master
English as a second language <,> and it is taught as if it were one <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#44:1:A>
The strategy of our English language education is very simple <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#45:1:A>
Start early <,> and get a lot of exposure <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#46:1:A>
Our language teachers may have attained their proficiency in
English through this natural way of language acquisition <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#47:1:A>
But to many local children an early start simply means an early
tendency to give up <,> and exposure <,> outside the classroom is practically
not available <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#48:1:A>
It is no surprise that the expensive scheme of hiring expatriate
English teachers in our schools <,> has often failed to provide the kind of
help that most of our students need <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#49:1:A>
A competent teacher <,> of a foreign language has to master both
the target language and the mother tongue of her pupils <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#50:1:A>
Not only must the teacher be aware of specific problems arising
from <,> mother tongue interference <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#51:1:A>
She must also be able to communicate <,> efficiently <,> with those
she teaches <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#52:1:A>
You cannot teach someone <,> you do not understand <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#53:1:A>
In learning a foreign language one  ' s mother tongue <,> should be
used as a toll as tool <,> not pushed aside as something <,> that should be
kept out of the way <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#54:1:A>
It is essential that both teacher and student <,> can make
effective use of this tool <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#55:1:A>
Instead of trying to become bilingual <,> at the start of schooling
<,> it is preferable for at least a proportion of the local children to defer
learning English as foreign language until a later stage <,> when they have
attained a basic level of proficiency in their first language

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#56:1:A>
This was in fact one of the more well-founded recommendations put
forward by the working group on language proficiency <,> set up earlier by
the Education Commission <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#57:1:A>
However <,> the Commission  ' s position on that recommendation is
equivocal <,> in the face of strong objections raised by the public <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#58:1:A>
Stark example of ill-informed attitude <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#59:1:A>
We have to reset our goals and rethink our approach <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#60:1:A>
I hope the new standing committee on language education and
research <,> recommended to be set up in the Education Commission  ' s report
<,> will set the course for development in the right direction <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#61:1:A>
When our schools begin to teach English as a decent foreign
language <,> our students will learn it <,> more happily <,> and efficiently
</I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-028#62:2:A>
The Preliminary Working Committee <,> the PWC is coming to the
end of its controversial existence <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#63:2:A>
It will dissolve after holding its final plenary meeting next month
<,> making way for the Preparatory Committee that will be formed early next
year <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#64:2:A>
The PWC has been accused of being illegitimate <,> by some people
<,> in the territory <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#65:2:A>
Its members have been criticised for lacking in representativeness
<,> credibility <,> integrity <,> and common sense <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#66:2:A>
There have been frequent allegations <,> that the business of the
PWC is to make sinister plots <,> to betray Hong Kong <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#67:2:A>
Hardly has there been any idea put forward by the PWC <,> that has
escaped castigation <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#68:2:A>
Proposals that have drawn particularly massive and ferocious
attacks <,> include plans for forming a provisional legislature upon the
transfer of government <,> and the treatment of the Bill of Rights Ordinance
<,> recently suggested <,> by the legal sub-group <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#69:2:A>
But controversy also surrounds the working body  ' s news on issues
like the definition of permanent residents  '  status <,> management of land
funds <,> assessment of academic qualifications <,> and preparing school
textbooks <,> for nineteen ninety-seven <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#70:2:A>
Unlike the Preparatory Committee <,> which has always been a part
of China  ' s plans for the hand-over arrangement <,> the PWC was formed only
in consequence of the breakdown in Sino-British co-operation <,> when both
sides resorted to unilateral actions <,> and Beijing realised <,> there was a
host of problems that could not be left unaddressed until the establishment
of the Preparatory Committee <,> in nineteen ninety-six <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#71:2:A>
By design <,> the work of the PWC is controversial <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#72:2:A>
Its areas of concern are precisely those where conflicting opinions
are heard are held by Beijing and London <,> and by opposing political camps
in Hong Kong <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#73:2:A>
Where there is already consensus or co-operation <,> the PWC has no
part to play <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#74:2:A>
Given the antagonistic circumstances in which the PWC was formed
<,> and the contentious nature of the issues it deals with <,> one can hardly
expect unanimous support in the territory <,> for the proposals it makes <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#75:2:A>
Too often <,> the PWC is more concerned with revealing and
defeating sabotage plots of the British <,> real or imagined <,> than with
winning people  ' s heart and minds <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#76:2:A>
Very few people in Hong Kong <,> would feel thankful to the PWC
members <,> for what they have done <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#77:2:A>
This is unfair to them <,> for most of then have in fact <,> been
honestly trying to act in the best interest of Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#78:2:A>
It should be realised <,> that the controversies have not been
created by the PWC <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#79:2:A>
With or without the PWC <,> the transition problems are there <,>
most of which ensuing from the breakdown of mutual trust and co-operation
between China and Britain <,> and between Hong Kong and Beijing <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#80:2:A>
Even if these problems had not been accentuated by the PWC <,> and
attracted public debate <,> they would not have disappeared <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#81:2:A>
Without the work of the PWC <,> disputes about all these problems
would only be postponed until the final months before the transfer of
government <,> with poorer chances of obtaining viable solutions <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#82:2:A>
It is not the PWC that decides for example <,> the the term of
office <,> of the last pre-nineteen ninety-seven Legislature <,> cannot last
beyond the change of government <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#83:2:A>
That was ordained <,> by the failure <,> of the Sino-British talks
two years ago <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#84:2:A>
The PWC is given the task of looking into problems that will arise
without the legislature through train <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#85:2:A>
It has to make suggestions as to when and how the first
post-British Legislature should be elected <,> and what interim measures
should be taken before the elections can be held <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#86:2:A>
The idea of forming a provisional legislature <,> has been
conceived as the best possible solution <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#87:2:A>
Despite harsh criticisms from opponents of this proposal <,> no
viable alternative has been put forward by them <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#88:2:A>
Similarly <,> it is not because the PWC has found fault with the
Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance that its status becomes contentious <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#89:2:A>
People familiar with the back ground of <.> th </.> the Ordinance
will know that right form the beginning of its existence <,> China has
maintained that its status is inconsistent with the Basic Law <,> and
therefore the Ordinance cannot survive the nineteen ninety-seven hand-over
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#90:2:A>
Perhaps few people are aware <,> that as a result of deliberations
within the PWC Chinese Government  ' s recent declaration of its position <,>
is equivalent to a promise that despite Beijing  ' s previous objections the
Bill of Rights Ordinance will remain in Hong Kong statute-books <,> after
nineteen ninety-seven <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#91:2:A>
For the time being however I am afraid nobody will be interested in
appeals against injustice to PWC members <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#92:2:A>
With the PWC winding up its business <,> and organization of the
Preparatory Committee underway <,> people are now turning their attention to
the new body <,> with euphoric expectations <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#93:2:A>
They hope the new committee will include representatives of a wider
spectrum of views <,> and will conduct its business in a more open and
transparent way <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#94:2:A>
Nobody can cast any doubt <,> on the legitimacy of the Preparatory
Committee <,> or its power to make arrangements for the establishment of the
Special Administrative Region <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#95:2:A>
The present Hong Kong Government has promised to give the new
committee support <,> which was denied to the PWC <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#96:2:A>
I do very much hope <,> that the Preparatory Committee <,> can
proceed with its work more smoothly <,> and with more co-operation and
support from all sides <,> than the PWC <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#97:2:A>
It must be realised however <,> that the contentions connected with
the PWC are not to become history together with the body itself <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#98:2:A>
The Preparatory Committee <,> will pick up where the PWC leaves off
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#99:2:A>
The PWC started its work with the list of the tasks of the
Preparatory Committee <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#100:2:A>
As the result of its work <,> the PWC will pass on to the
Preparatory Committee <,> a report containing proposals on how these tasks
can best be carried out <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#101:2:A>
Most if not all of the PWC members <,> will probably be
reappointed by the Chinese Government to sit on the Preparatory Committee <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#102:2:A>
Even if the Preparatory Committee includes a numbers of new
members with different opinions <,> it is unlikely that it can stray very
much <,> from the recommendations of the PWC <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-028#103:2:A>
Large part of its work will simply be implementing controversial
plans <,> the PWC has announced <,> like forming a provisional legislature
<,> preparing for new elections after the new government takes over and
providing Chinese National People  ' s Congress with the list of Hong Kong laws
that should be repealed for contravening the Basic Law </I>
