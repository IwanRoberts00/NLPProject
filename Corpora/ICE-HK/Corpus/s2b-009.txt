The Financial Secretary projects an extra five billion dollars
could be spent on public services in next year  ' s budget

<ICE-HK:S2B-009#121:2:B>
Hamish Macleod announced the windfall today in his unprecedented
budget consultations with Legislators <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-009#122:2:B>
The amount of five billion dollars over and above this year  ' s
public spending budget is allowed within the bounds of the trend economic
growth rate of five percent <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-009#123:2:B>
The Financial Secretary says one billion would be for capital
costs <,> and it  ' s hoped parts of the other four billion will go to
rehabilitation social welfare and health <,> five hundred and fifty seven
million provisions and the education reports number three to five <,> four
hundred and seventy million <,>

consultations as an improvement in Executive Legislative relationship <,> but
he worries whether one week is enough time

After next week it seems to me that uh we cannot really
propose any more recommendation concerning the uh government expenditure

<ICE-HK:S2B-009#129:2:C>
I think it  ' s quite uh <,> uh the timing is quite unreasonable for
all Legco members to come to some consensus
