The MISR Technology Envelope project </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#2:1>
The objective of the MISR Technology Envelope project is to bring
together many technical infrastructures to establish a &ldquo; boundless
solution &rdquo; of networking services that comply to a predefined quality
standard and lead to repeatable success of the overall design .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#3:1>
The technical infrastructure includes supporting software and
computing platforms that provide general support to all business applications .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#4:1>
Users can have a &ldquo; common interface &rdquo; to access the entire IT
architecture of the enterprise .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#5:1>
The networking services provide an &ldquo; information superhighway
&rdquo; for users to access current and future applications on a multiple
computer platform environment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#6:1>
As a result , business applications become independent of the physical
location .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#7:1>
The Application Program Interface can now be redefined as the rules by
which business applications call common services by the technical
disciplines; it finally becomes the boundary between business application and
technical infrastructure .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#8:1>
When users access an enterprise  ' s IT architecture , they should be
provided with interoperability , reusability , scalability and autonomy .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#9:1>
To achieve the above objectives , the technologies and business
approaches that are getting the most attention nowadays are open systems ,
client-server configurations and rightsizing/downsizing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#10:1>
Each of these approaches can play a distinct and important role
in giving the business a competitive advantage .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#11:1>
The challenge is to figure out which combinations will best help IT
users to meet their business goals . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#12:1>
Setting up and implementing networking services is not the final
goal of the project .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#13:1>
These services need t be managed so that the committed quality &obrack;  i.e.
, Service Level &cbrack; can be delivery to the end users .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#14:1>
Various network management techniques need to be incorporated in the
project so that the networking services can produce maximum efficiency .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#15:1>
The demands of future networking services should be simulated and
forecast and these services should be compatible with predefined financial
objectives .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#16:1>
The proposed set up needs to be flexible enough to accommodate new
technology .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#17:1>
Another major success factor is that business process re-engineering
will often provoke adverse reactions from the end users and special action
plans need to be established to handle such situations . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#18:1>
This project looks at the various factors in business process
re-engineering and try to apply the relevant technical and management
principles .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#19:1>
The ultimate objective is to provide a framework for the evolution of
IT within an organization based on business and technical standards .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#20:1>
By means of these organizational and technical innovations , the IT
organization will provide users value trough the use of IT . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#21:1>
THE MISR PROJECT FORMULATION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#22:1>
This section describes the formation of the Technology Envelope
Project and the methodologies used to identify the opportunities and
requirements .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#23:1>
The key questions addressed were: Where are we now ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#24:1>
&obrack;  existing business information systems &obrack;  IS/IT environment &cbrack; 

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#25:1>
Where do we want to be ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#26:1>
&obrack;  Future business and IS/IT environment - vision)

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#27:1>
How do we get there ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#28:1>
&obrack;  opportunities and environment &cbrack; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#29:1>
The study was also designed to address the following questions
relative to the implementation of IT infrastructure in MISR: ? Strategic
IS/IT for current requirements and future growth ? Ease of use and ease of
adoption by end users ? Flexible design , time to market ? Co-existence of
current and future networking systems ? Compatibility of protocols ? The
distribution computing approaching </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#30:1>
This will lead to the formation of an IT infrastructure for today  ' s
manufacturing environment and finally to the Technology Envelop model . </p>
<h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#31:1>
Information Strategy/Information Technology alignment </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#32:1>
Earl &obrack;  1 &cbrack; described a model that draws a clear distinction
between IS strategy and IT strategy &obrack;  Figure 1 &cbrack; . </p> <O> Diagram </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#33:1>
IS strategy addresses the question &ldquo; what is required?" .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#34:1>
Earl described the IS strategy as being &ldquo; concerned primarily
with aligning IS development with business needs and with seeking strategic
advantage from IT &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#35:1>
IT strategy addresses the question &ldquo; how can it be
delivered?" .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#36:1>
It should define the technical framework within which IS applications
will be developed and operated .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#37:1>
Earl described the IT strategy as being &ldquo; concerned primarily
with technology policies .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#38:1>
It tackles questions of architecture , including risk attitudes ,
vendor policies and technical standards" . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#39:1>
Environmental analysis </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#40:1>
External forces affect strategic IT planning , so changes in the
environment call for new organizational strategies .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#41:1>
To address the question &ldquo; <bold> where are we now </bold> ?
&rdquo; we need to perform an environment analysis .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#42:1>
This includes external factors , such as opportunities and threat
analysis , and internal factors , such as strengths and weaknesses analysis .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#43:1>
The objective is to understand the current company position . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#44:1>
The major factors in environmental analysis are: Major trends
in the environment

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#45:1>
Implications of these trends for the organization

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#46:1>
The most significant opportunities and threat analysis </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#47:1>
The aim of the study is to identify several major opportunities
and threats from the trend information , then produce a documented picture of
the most significant environmental developments around which the organization
must formulate its future goals , strategies , structures and systems . </p>
<h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#48:1>
Strategic structure technique </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#49:1>
To address the question &ldquo; <bold> where do we want to be
</bold> ? &rdquo; the strategic structure technique was adopted . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#50:1>
The challenge of competitive strategy is to create a competitive
advantage for the organization .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#51:1>
This comes from positioning an organization in a strategic position
so it has an edge in coping with competitive forces and attracting additional
users . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#52:1>
In order to establish the direction , we need to consider the
internal/external business environment together with the internal/external
IS/IT environment going through the structure technique to identify the
opportunity and requirements . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#53:1>
The structure technique provides a mechanism for focusing
alternative treatments on areas that should receive priority because they
offer opportunities to reduce costs , add value or gain competitive position .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#54:1>
M.E. Porter identified three generic strategies for achieving
competitive advantage in the market place: cost , differentiation and focus
leadership &obrack;  2 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#55:1>
Organizations continuously search for new and innovative ways to
implement these strategies successfully .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#56:1>
The logistics function has been identified in many organizations as
providing an excellent opportunity to exploit the above strategies . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#57:1>
Porter also included the concept of a value chain that &ldquo;
disaggregates &rdquo; a firm into its strategically relevant activities in
order to understand the behaviour of costs and the existing and potential
sources of differentiation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#58:1>
He suggested that a firm gains competitive advantage by performing
these important activities either less expensively or better than its
competitors . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#59:1>
The value chain analysis is a systematic way of analysing both
the direct and support activities carried out by an organization .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#60:1>
It is used to analyse how to improve cost structure &obrack;  productivity &cbrack; and value added &obrack;  product differentiation &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#61:1>
In the MISR project , the value chain follows the route of entry of a
new project through the various processes on to the finish of the project and
beyond . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#62:1>
Value chain analysis has two levels .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#63:1>
Initially , each activity is analysed for opportunity for the company
networking services to reduce cost or add value .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#64:1>
Then , the interaction between activities is analysed for
opportunities to reduce costs further and add value through enhanced
coordination , integration , and information flows . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#65:1>
Bottleneck analysis devises strategic action to eliminate
bottlenecks throughout the value chain .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#66:1>
The major information infrastructure bottlenecks are: Application
development

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#67:1>
Configuration management

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#68:1>
Network computing operation , administration and maintenance

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#69:1>
Platforms - Technology Envelope Model

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#70:1>
Application - strategic application </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#71:1>
Breaking these bottlenecks provides the basic for advantage .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#72:1>
M.E . Porter also identified &ldquo; service &rdquo; as one of the
primary activities in the value chain and suggests that the principal value
of the service is that it may help to enhance or maintain the value of the
product , through activities such as installation , repair training , parts
supply and product adjustment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#73:1>
Another way to understand the overall cost structure is via value
system analysis , which can be considered as an external value chain .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#74:1>
This is a systematic approach to examining the interaction between
organizations within a value system and identifying opportunities for
networking systems to reduce costs or add value through enhanced coordination
, integration and information flow .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#75:1>
It establishes a framework for analyzing interaction between supply
chains - can the networking system reduce cost or add value through enhanced
coordination , integrate and information flow between organizations , for
example by including the customer and vendor in the value chain in order to
reduce costs or add value ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#76:1>
Critical success factor analysis is the technique used to focus
attention on a limited number of areas to ensure successful performance .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#77:1>
The tasks identified to be done is the critical business issue .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#78:1>
The objective is to assist users to adopt IT infrastructure to
enhance competitive advantage . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#79:1>
In the MISR project , the critical business issue identified was:
to optimize the network system availability to support the key applications
that are vital to the success of the project .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#80:1>
This issue should also identify the way that performance is measured
, the impact of reaching the target level , the current objective and the
future goal . </p> <h> <bold>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#105:1>
The study was designed to address the following issues relative
to the implementation of an MISR company-wide IT infrastructure: Any work
station/PC to any &obrack;  application &cbrack; connectivity

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#106:1>
Application manoeuvrability

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#107:1>
Co-existence of current and future systems

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#108:1>
Easily adopted by users

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#109:1>
Foundation of future business process re-engineering </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#110:1>
The products of the project would be: A company-wide IT
infrastructure

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#111:1>
A framework that can serve the evolving the needs of the users .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#112:1>
It can also act as a catalyst for IT evolution within the user
organization based on predefined technical standards

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#113:1>
A framework for the Information Superhighway &obrack;  Internet &cbrack; and other
global information access systems

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#114:1>
A transport vehicle to support future application systems that
will run in a distributed environment </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#115:1>
Technology trends &ampersand; the Internet </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#116:1>
The MISR Project team studied the trends in technology &obrack;  details
in Appendix I &cbrack; and found that historically , IT organizations have supported
their users with computer resources &obrack;  in terms of MIPs and storage &cbrack; and
business applications &obrack;  life cycle development and maintenance services &cbrack; .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#117:1>
Owing to the increasing commercial use of the Internet , the
Commercial Internet Exchange was found in 1995 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#118:1>
It interconnects major networking companies for commercial traffic .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#119:1>
The networking service is changing from the LAN-based file &ampersand; print ,
simple directory , Email and database and the Web-based searching and
publishing application to Internet-based directory , security , groupware and
strategic business applications .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#120:1>
IT organizations need to focus on the following: Professional
services such as system integration , business solution consulting , business
re-engineering consulting and project management

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#121:1>
Distributed processing platforms and application services

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#122:1>
Information sharing applications such as electronic mail and
documentation collaboration

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#123:1>
Supply services for global computing via the Internet </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#124:1>
Additionally , services will have to be packaged to meet the
fragmented needs of different customers .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#125:1>
Rather than one size fits all , a family of services should be built
around one product theme .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#126:1>
This service should include a low cost Spartan solution , a
high-value solution , a high-end solution and a customizable solution . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#127:1>
According to Boar &obrack;  5 &cbrack; &ldquo; Successful IMM organization in
the 90s - On one hand they will have to maintain , nourish , and extend the
large embedded dbase of host-base systems which were built over the past 20
to 30 years .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#128:1>
On the other hand , they will have to move aggressively to offer
solutions for high mobile and networked users deploying ever more
application-specific information technologies as a result of re-engineering &rdquo; .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#129:1>
All the building blocks for the future exist within most IT
organizations today in some form &obrack;  see Appendix 2 &cbrack; . They are: Data
processing

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#130:1>
End user computing

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#131:1>
Document processing and job flow control

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#132:1>
Global electronic mail system

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#133:1>
Intelligent printing

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#134:1>
Voice mail and audio text applications

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#135:1>
Image processing and graphics </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#136:1>
Future strategies </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#137:1>
To address the question &ldquo; <bold> How can we get there
</bold> ? &rdquo; , a project has been initiated to &ldquo; Get , move and use
information to support business process re-engineering" .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#138:1>
The &ldquo; Desired future state position &rdquo; will be defined ,
then the techniques of value chain analysis , bottleneck analysis and CFS
analysis will be adopted . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#139:1>
The challenges that IT managers face nowadays are: ? Networking
for mission-critical applications .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#140:1>
Maintaining a constant labour force while the workload increases

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#141:1>
The continued growth of the network at a compound rate

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#142:1>
Demands from the users for a faster product time to market </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#143:1>
IT management needs to accommodate the growing users demands for
computing and networking services while reducing costs .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#144:1>
During the strategic analysis , we identified three major
bottlenecks for success of the technology envelope model:  Application
development

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#145:1>
rapid creation and amending of applications

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#146:1>
Configuration management

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#147:1>
Adaptation of the technology envelope model to manage network
computing in a multivendor environment

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#148:1>
Orderly evolution of network components

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#149:1>
Network computing operations , administration and maintenance that
is daily end to end operation of client/server computing architecture </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#150:1>
This can be divided into two levels: ? Platforms - address using
the technology envelope approach

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#151:1>
Application - address using applications management </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#152:1>
As discussed during the value chain analysis by Porter and
McKinsey , breaking these bottlenecks provides the basis of advantage .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#153:1>
To do this , the MIRS Project team adopted the value chain interlock
approach , which makes the logistics as effective as possible and can offer
better services and lower prices for comparable products . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#154:1>
Strategies pursued </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#155:1>
The following strategic items were identified for study by the
MISR Project team: Technical services strategy

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#156:1>
Global electronic mail environment

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#157:1>
Common networking software

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#158:1>
Access security

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#159:1>
Provide Internet services

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#160:1>
Document sharing and groupware

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#161:1>
Internal communication and electronic forms

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#162:1>
Office automation and job flow control

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#163:1>
Cost control &obrack;  deliver services in a cost effective manner &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#164:1>
Focus - software , hardware , networking

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#165:1>
Service level &obrack;  dependable and consistent services &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#166:1>
Reliability , availability , serviceability

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#167:1>
Focus - training , networking and system tuning .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#168:1>
Research and Development &obrack;  review , test and integrate new
technology &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#169:1>
Focus - network integration

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#170:1>
Inter-Networking standards

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#171:1>
System hardware/software standards

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#172:1>
PABX/voice standards

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#173:1>
End user computing and graphics standards </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#174:1>
Based upon the above findings , the MISR Project team defined
networking information infrastructure as the trend to be followed most
closely .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#175:1>
Eventually , all telecommunications service will need to be
integrated .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#176:1>
The work station of the future will be not only a multi-functional
data device , but a true multiple function facility for data and voice .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#177:1>
Inter-Networking services will remain the focus and make productive
all capital in use within the organization .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#178:1>
Building and managing the network through all demand levels is the
future challenge . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#179:1>
The objective for the project team is to look at the various
factors in business process re-engineering and try to apply the relevant
technical and management principles to handle the situation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#180:1>
The team must provide a framework for the evolution of IT within the
organization based on business and technical standards .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#181:1>
It should also reduce overall cost while improving performance .

<ICE-HK:W2A-032#182:1>
By means of these organizational and technical innovations , IT
organizations will provide user value through the use of Information
Technology . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-032#183:1>
Just as an effective highway system is needed to facilitate
