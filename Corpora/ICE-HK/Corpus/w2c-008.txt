<ICE-HK:W2C-008#3:1>
BORDER villagers have suffered crop losses and property damage
caused by illegal immigrants threading their way through farms to the urban
areas . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#4:1>
Growing fears that more damage may result from a sharp rise in the
number of Chinese illegal immigrants have prompted villagers to call for more
police patrols . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#5:1>
Ta Kwu Ling rural committee claimed it received several complaints
about crop damage every month . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#6:1>
Chairman Cheung For-tai said : &ldquo; Villagers are alerted by
dogs barking and the trespassers must be strangers . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#7:1>
Sha Tau Kok rural committee vice-chairman Cheung Koon-yan said
abandoned villages at Yung Shue Au , where most residents have moved to the
urban area , were targeted . &ldquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#8:1>
There have been complaints by villagers that several pieces of
furniture in their huts go missing when they return home .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#9:1>
Some huts are also damaged .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#10:1>
It must be the mainland immigrants who can reach there easily by boat
, &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#11:1>
Chief Inspector Maurice Watterson of Field Patrol Detachment ,
which is responsible for patrolling the border , said they had never heard of
such complaints . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#12:1>
But the rural committees said most villagers did not bother to
report to police .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#13:1>
There are more than 100 villages along the border . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#14:1>
Concern over border security rose last month after the killing of
police sergeant Tai Choi , 43 , at a border village of Nga Yiu Ha . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#15:1>
He was chasing an illegal immigrant when the immigrant  ' s hand
grenade exploded , killing both of them . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#16:1>
North district board member Liu Chun-kui , of Border Central
constituency , was worried the situation would worsen with the recent massive
influx of illegal immigrants . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#17:1>
&ldquo; The police should review their operation and deployment
after the killing of the sergeant . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#18:1>
&ldquo; We learn that some immigrants even enter villagers  '  huts
and borrow telephones at nights .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#19:1>
More patrols are needed , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#20:1>
Police have arrested 15,569 illegal immigrants in the first five
months this year , 32.4 per cent up from the same period last year .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#21:1>
Last year police arrested a total of 33,703 immigrants . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#22:1>
Ta Kwu Ling assistant divisional commander &obrack; operations
and crime &cbrack; Inspector Chan Shiu-keung said they received villagers  ' 
reports occasionally but said he believed the immigrants posed little threat .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#23:1>
&ldquo; It is natural that the illegal immigrants may run on
fields and damage some crops if they are chased by police .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#24:1>
I believe the damage must be very minor . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#25:1>
&ldquo; To the illegal immigrants , it is most imperative to get
to the city centre as quickly as possible .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#26:1>
It is very unlikely for them to make trouble for villagers which may
attract police attention , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#27:1>
New Territories North regional commander , Assistant Commissioner
of police , Douglas Lau Yuk-kuen said : &ldquo; It is not fair to generalise
and make criticisms when , say , there are only one or two cases in several
months . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#28:1>
He said it was unnecessary to set up reporting centres at remote
villages . </p> </I>

<bold> Split in housing protest group </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#30:2>
<bold> By NG KANG-CHUNG </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#31:2>
GRASSROOTS groups fighting the Government  ' s double-rent policy
have split following the arrests of 23 protesters outside the Governor  ' s
house . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#32:2>
Some groups have accused the organisers of Thursday  ' s
demonstration of putting the tenants at risk and others have hinted that they
will sever ties with them for fear of being implicated . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#33:2>
The protest against the Housing Authority  ' s policy to charge
better-off tenants higher rents was organised by a radical pressure group ,
Hongkong People  ' s Council on Public Housing Policy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#34:2>
Last June the council , in protest against a seven per cent
increase in rents for new flats , barred authority staff from their offices ,
forcing the authority to close for one day . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#35:2>
On Thursday the group led about 150 tenants to petition
Government House and blocked traffic for hours .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#36:2>
Earlier , some tenants scuffled with security guards at the authority
headquarters as they tried to break through a barricade . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#37:2>
The council yesterday insisted on protesting until the
double-rent policy was scrapped , claiming it was against the principle of
fairness despite some modifications by the authority . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#38:2>
The revised policy , which takes effect from next month ,
requires households with incomes between two and three times the limit for
public housing to pay 50 per cent more rent . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#39:2>
Those earnings more than three times the limit will have to pay
twice the normal rent .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#40:2>
But they will be given preference in buying Home Ownership Scheme
flats . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#41:2>
For example , a family of four who earn more than &dollar;34,200
a month will pay rent of about &dollar;2,000 , given the normal median rent
of &dollar;1,000 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#42:2>
The authority estimates that about 60,000 families will be paying
50 per cent more and 15,000 families will pay double rent in 1993-94 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#43:2>
The chairman of the Federation of Public Housing Estate Residents
and Shop Owners Organisations , Mr Hau Shui-pui , said it was unlikely there
would be co-operation with the People  ' s Council in view of the latter  ' s
radical approach . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#44:2>
Mr Hau said : &ldquo; We are civilised and reasonable men .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#45:2>
Savage action cannot help much but make problems more difficult .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#46:2>
And it risks losing public support . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#47:2>
Hongkong Association for Democracy and People  ' s Livelihood also
expressed reservation about close co-operation with the council . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#48:2>
A spokesman said : &ldquo; Our experience has taught us that
joint action often leads to internal arguments about who is to lead and how
it is to be led .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#49:2>
We often make concessions to keep things going . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#50:2>
Its vice-chairman , Mr Leung Kwong-cheong , said he feared
tenants might be discouraged from taking part in petitions to avoid being
involved in radical confrontation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#51:2>
But the vice-chairman of the People  ' s Council , Mr Lo Chau ,
said they were forced to use violence . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#52:2>
&ldquo; We hope to be peaceful .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#53:2>
But the Government always does things to anger us . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#54:2>
&ldquo; There would not have been any violence on Thursday had
the police not barricaded the road and had we been allowed to see the
Governor . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#55:2>
During Thursday  ' s protest , 12 tenants and 11 council staff were
arrested .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#56:2>
They were released on police bail and required to report to the
Central Police Station in three weeks . </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#59:3>
THE tax cut proposals in the Budget did not bring much joy for
engineer Mr Kelvin Wong and his family . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#60:3>
Mr Wong , 32 , a building services engineer , and his wife ,
Janet , a medical technologist , who recently gave birth to their first child
, Chun-kit , are renting a flat in Kowloon Bay . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#61:3>
With family income totalling about &dollar;50,000 a month , Mr
Wong and his wife are paying salaries tax at the standard rate of 15 per cent
and cannot expect much benefit from the proposed 22 per cent rise in basic
tax allowances . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#62:3>
Last year , they were required to pay nearly &dollar;70,000 for
salaries tax because they were not eligible for most tax allowances , like
dependent parents allowances . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#63:3>
Describing themselves as a &ldquo; taxation sandwich class family
&rdquo; , Mr Wong said last night he was disappointed by Mr Macleod  ' s
proposals . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#64:3>
&ldquo; People with professional status like engineers or doctors
will face similar problems as we do , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#65:3>
&ldquo; The tax allowances are not for us , but we have to
contribute 15 per cent of our income to the Government . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#66:3>
Being a car owner , he was also unhappy with the up to 5.7 per
cent rise in petrol prices because of the fuel tax increase .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#67:3>
He expected he might have to pay &dollar;200 more a month . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#68:3>
Despite tax cuts on cosmetics and stamp duty on stocks , the
family said they would gain &ldquo; zero benefit &rdquo; from Mr Macleod  ' s
proposals . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#69:3>
&ldquo; They are insignificant reductions , &rdquo; Mrs Wong said .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#70:3>
&ldquo; I seldom wear make-up and I do not think many people will
rush to buy more cosmetics because of the tax reduction . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#71:3>
The only good news for Mr Wong was the &dollar;2 billion
injection into the Housing Society to build sandwich class flats . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#72:3>
&ldquo; I do not have a great deal of hope in the overall Budget
, but the sandwich class housing sounds an exciting package , &rdquo; he said .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#73:3>
Mr Wong and his wife have been looking for a flat since they
married a year ago , but have found the prices too high . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#74:3>
&ldquo; It is great that the Government is at last willing to do
something for the sandwich class , although the proposed scheme only benefits
3,000 families in the next three years , &rdquo; Mr Wong said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#75:3>
&ldquo; We are hoping for some flexible arrangements , say ,
setting a higher income limit and discount so that those , like us , who are
at the upper segment of the sandwich class , can benefit . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#76:3>
He hoped the Financial Secretary could raise basic allowances for
married people to &dollar;140,000 or lower the standard tax rate to 10 per
cent to benefit the taxation sandwich class families . </p> </I>

Assessment to decide choice of school </bold> </h> <h>

<bold> By NG KANG-CHUNG </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#80:4>
AN examination intended to decide whether primary school pupils
go to Chinese or English-language secondary schools has been scrapped
following criticism from teachers and parents . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#81:4>
Internal school assessments will now be used in an effort to ease
the pressure of exams on pupils , according to the Education Department .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#82:4>
Known as the Revised Method of Medium of Instruction Grouping
Assessment , the new scheme has been approved by the Education Commission and
will be adopted for entry to Secondary One in September 1994 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#83:4>
There will be Chinese and English subject groups under the
revised assessments . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#84:4>
For most primary pupils the English group will consist of English
language only , while the Chinese group will comprise the rest of the
subjects . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#85:4>
Parents and teachers will be able to judge pupils  '  English or
Chinese proficiency and decide which schools the pupils should go to , based
on the assessment results . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#86:4>
Director of Education Dominic Wong Shing-wah said the new scheme
would not mean any extra work for teachers and would lessen the pressure on
students . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#87:4>
&ldquo; As the revised method will emphasise the importance of
continuous internal assessments , the principle of a balanced curriculum in
primary schools is upheld , &rdquo; Mr Wong said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#88:4>
The department proposed the so-called Secure Hongkong Attainment
Tests in April to dictate the teaching medium for pupils . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#89:4>
Meeting Point last night welcomed the scrapping of the tests but
said the revised assessment would also add pressure to students , although
with fewer exams . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#90:4>
The group said it was unreasonable to judge a student  ' s language
ability by internal assessments , which test academic performance . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#91:4>
It feared the assessments would fail to achieve their intended
aim , because most parents regarded English as more important than Chinese .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#92:4>
The parents might press their children to work hard at English so as
to send them to an English-medium school . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#93:4>
It urged the Government to scrap the language streaming policy
and make more effort to promote mother-tongue education . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#94:4>
The Hongkong Professional Teachers Union also said the department
should try to promote mother-tongue education with the new assessment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#95:4>
Union chairman and legislator Cheung Man-kwong said the
department should regularly send inspectors to monitor English-stream classes
to make sure teachers were qualified to teach in English and the students
were able to learn with that medium of instruction . </p> </I>

WITHIN hours of the Budget announcement motorists were paying up
to 5.7 per cent more for their petrol . </p> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#99:5>
The leaded petrol price was up from &dollar;7.70 to &dollar;8.14
per litre , while lead-free petrol jumped from &dollar;7.41 to &dollar;7.80 .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#100:5>
Diesel went up from &dollar;5.09 to &dollar;5.29 per litre . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#101:5>
Oil companies said last night the new prices reflected the rise
in tax on a cent-for-cent basis . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#102:5>
The marketing director of Shell , Mr Bruce Tremayne , said :
&ldquo; The higher excise duties are payable immediately .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#103:5>
Therefore , we have no choice but to adjust our prices accordingly .
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#104:5>
Mr Macleod said the 9.5 per cent increase in fuel duty was in
line with the inflation rate so as to &ldquo; maintain the real value &rdquo;
of the duty . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#105:5>
Some environmental protection groups , however , said the petrol
duty differentiation was not big enough to encourage motorists to switch to
lead-free petrol . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#106:5>
Conservancy Association spokesman Mr Gordon Ng Ting-leung said :
&ldquo; It is contradictory to the &lsquo; polluter pays &rsquo; principle .

POLICE and Urban Services Department officers will launch late
night raids next month to crack down on food stalls and hawkers who occupy
pavements . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#111:6>
The first strike will take place at several black spots in Wan
Chai , where pedestrians are forced to walk on to busy roads to avoid tables
and chairs . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#112:6>
Some Wan Chai residents living near the black spots say they
have considered moving to avoid the nuisance created by the illegal operators .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#113:6>
Many stalls start at about 11 pm and work well into the small
hours . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#114:6>
Residents complain they can only get four hours  '  sleep a night .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#115:6>
The Wan Chai District Hygiene Superintendent , Mr Cheung
Hing-lui , said his department was aware of the seriousness of the problem
and was co-operating with police to conduct more night-time clearances . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#116:6>
&ldquo; There will be at least seven operations each month .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#117:6>
They aim to last until 3 am to prevent the hawkers from returning
when our officers have gone , &rdquo; said Mr Cheung . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#118:6>
One notorious black spot is near the junction of Jaffe Road and
Cannon Street , a few blocks from the Excelsior Hotel . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#119:6>
Residents say there are about 20 hawkers operating cooked food
stalls from 11 pm to 3 pm every night . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#120:6>
Mrs Tam Chan Yuen-yan said , &ldquo; We usually watch television
until 3 am .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#121:6>
You simply cannot sleep until then because they are so noisy .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#122:6>
You can even hear clearly what dishes the people order . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#123:6>
We even had to arrange for our two children to go to
kindergarten in the afternoon . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#124:6>
The Tam family , who moved into their second-floor flat at
Cannon Street last year , say they are looking for a new apartment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#125:6>
&ldquo; We cannot stand it any longer , &rdquo; Mrs Tam said .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#126:6>
Wan Chai District Board chairman Mrs Peggy Lam Pei Yu-dja
described the seriousness of the hawker problem in her district as &ldquo;
unbelievable &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#127:6>
She suggested that the Government followed the Singapore example
of moving all hawkers into multi-storey markets . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#128:6>
Mrs Tam  ' s neighbour , Mr Sammy Chan , criticised the Government  ' s
lack of a long-term policy to crack down on hawkers in the district . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#129:6>
&ldquo; We may have one or two hours of peace and quiet
sometimes when the Urban Services Department people are here to clear them
off .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#130:6>
But when that have gone , all the hawkers return , &rdquo; said Mr
Chan . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#131:6>
Another Cannon Street resident , Mr Robert So said : &ldquo; The
traffic here is very busy , particularly at night .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#132:6>
But the pavements are covered with hawkers .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#133:6>

A PRESSURE group , campaigning for the Housing Authority to be
revamped staged a street drama outside the authority  ' s Ho Man Tin
headquarters yesterday to ridicule its policies . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#137:7>
The high-profile Hongkong People  ' s Council on Public Housing
Policy is demanding that authority members be elected from the territory  ' s
district boards , with each of the 19 boards having one representative . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#138:7>
They also want the authority to be monitored by the Legislative
Council . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#139:7>
People  ' s Council chairman , Mr Lo Chau , said : &ldquo; The
authority is anti-democratic .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#140:7>
The members are appointed by the Government and many of them have
connections with the business sector . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#141:7>
Mr Lo accused the authority of &ldquo; turning a deaf ear to
public opinions &rdquo; and said it should be disbanded . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#142:7>
The mock play saw a &ldquo; judge &rdquo; listening to
accusations made against a Westerner who had a card which read &ldquo;
Housing Authority &rdquo; hanging from his neck . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#143:7>
The Westerner was intended to depict the authority  ' s chairman ,
Sir David Akers-Jones .

<ICE-HK:W2C-008#144:7>
At the end of the &ldquo; hearing &rdquo; , the judge told him to
dismiss the authority . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-008#145:7>
Controversy over the representativeness of the authority  ' s
