<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#2:1>
With all their expensive gizmos , the Hong Kong Observatory team
just haven't been making the right calls lately .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#3:1>
<it> Ella Lee </it> joins the weathermen to see why their recent
predictions on typhoon behaviour have created a storm of their own </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#4:1>
<bold> THE DAILY WEATHER-FORECAST </bold> conference at the Hong
Kong Observatory  ' s Tsim Sha Tsui headquarters resembled a small scientific
meeting .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#5:1>
Forecaster Wong Wai-kin stood in front of a large and colourful
meteorological graphic showing the track of Typhoon Toraji , newly formed
east of the Philippines and at that stage heading towards Taiwan . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#6:1>
Four senior scientific officers and acting assistant director for
the Observatory Edwin Ginn Wing-lui carefully listened and considered what
should be included in the weather-forecast bulletin for the next five days .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#7:1>
It was Friday afternoon , and just two days earlier , this same
team of government meteorologists had been severely criticized for hoisting
the No 8 gale-force-wind signal warning for Typhoon Yutu , which missed Hong
Kong and brought nothing more than a little rain to the SAR . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#8:1>
Businessmen accused the Observatory of being &ldquo; incompetent
&rdquo; and &ldquo; irresponsible &rdquo; for raising the signal , which kept
most people across Hong Kong at home .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#9:1>
During the 19 hours that the No 8 signal was hoisted , the SAR was
closed for business , causing a loss estimated at between &dollar;3.5 billion
and &dollar;5 billion . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#10:1>
But at last Friday  ' s internal conference , the controversy was
forgotten as the weathermen concentrated on the task at hand - evaluating the
likely impact of Toraji on Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#11:1>
Mr Wong , a scientific officer , concentrated on the complicated
graphics behind him .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#12:1>
&ldquo; Based on the current track of Toraji , it will not hit Hong
Kong directly .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#13:1>
The coming days will be hot , and there will be some showers in the
evening... &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#14:1>
This time , the Observatory was right .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#15:1>
On Sunday and Monday , it issued the &ldquo; very hot weather &rdquo;
warning as the mercury level shot up to 35 degree Celsius . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#16:1>
Toraji followed the Observatory  ' s predicted track and swept
across Taiwan , packing winds of 150 kilometres per hour .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#17:1>
The storm caused the worst floods and mudslides in Taiwan for 50
years .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#18:1>
At least 46 people , including two police officers , were killed and
more than 150 went missing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#19:1>
Typhoon Toraji was yesterday moving northwest into the coastal
province of Fujian and was expected to bring rainstorms to several provinces .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#20:1>
The Observatory  ' s correct call on Toraji shows how
meteorologists can be right in their forecasts , just as the Yutu experience
two days earlier showed they can also be wrong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#21:1>
Mr Ginn said the inconsistencies in weather forecasts were easier
to understand in light of big discrepancies in the information received from
overseas .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#22:1>
In front of a computer screen displaying satellite images of Toraji
at the Observatory  ' s forecasting centre .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#23:1>
Mr Ginn pointed to several coloured lines on the map stretching from
the Philippines to Taiwan . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#24:1>
&ldquo; Each line represents the forecasts made by individual
around the world .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#25:1>
They include the authorities in Europe , Britain , the United States
and Japan .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#26:1>
You can see how those tracks are different from each other . &rdquo;
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#27:1>
The forecast track for Toraji provided by the European Centre for
Medium Range Weather Forecast was 450 kilometres away from the one prepared
by the US National Weather Services .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#28:1>
&ldquo; Inconsistency is not uncommon , because different countries
use their own data and models to come up with predictions .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#29:1>
There is no single formula . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#30:1>
The Observatory introduced an internal audit system in 1984 to
compare its forecasts with what actually happens .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#31:1>
The audits showed that the weather-forecast services , which cost
about &dollar;190 million last year , are about 85 per cent accurate , on
average .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#32:1>
Last year , the Observatory also extended its advance forecasts from
four days to five .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#33:1>
It conducts public-opinion surveys twice a year .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#34:1>
According to the surveys , the public perceive its services to be 77
per cent accurate - slightly up on the 72 per cent recorded a decade ago .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#35:1>
But with Typhoon Yutu , there was little accuracy .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#36:1>
The Observatory hoisted the No 8 signal about midnight on Wednesday
morning , even though wind speeds in Victoria Harbour had failed to reach the
minimum speed of 63 kilometres per hour which the Observatory normally
requires before raising the signal .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#37:1>
The typhoon did not hit Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#38:1>
Instead , it passed well to the south , affecting only southern
Lantau and Cheung Chau islands . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#39:1>
The controversy over Yutu was only part if a recent wave of
grievances leveled at the Observatory .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#40:1>
Only a few weeks earlier , on the afternoon of July 6 , the
Observatory downgraded its warning signal for Typhoon Utor from No 8 to No 3
, just as winds at Chek Lap Kok Airport were actually becoming stronger .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#41:1>
All flight landings and take-offs were cancelled for six hours ,
and about 17,000 passengers were stranded at the airport at the peak of the
chaos . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#42:1>
In 1999 , the Observatory was also criticized for being
incompetent for failing to warn Hong Kong about the ferocity of Typhoon York
, which killed one person and injured almost 500 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#43:1>
Angry business leaders are now calling on the Government to
overhaul the storm-signal system .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#44:1>
The General Chamber of Commerce has received a flood of calls from
members furious about repeated occasions when , they claimed , the No 8
signal was hoisted unnecessarily . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#45:1>
Chief Secretary for Administration Donald Tsang Yam-kuen has
defended the Observatory , saying it was better &ldquo; to be on the safe
side" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#46:1>
But James Tien Pei-chun , Liberal Party chairman and legislator ,
labelled the weathermen &ldquo; incompetent" .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#47:1>
&ldquo; The Observatory made two serious mistakes in a row; the
taxpayers have spent so much money on it , but the forecast is so bad .
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#48:1>
Mr Tien said the Observatory  ' s scientists were &ldquo;
irresponsible &rdquo; because they had chosen the easy way out by adopting a
very high safety margin .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#49:1>
He said during Typhoon Yutu , the Observatory sacrificed the Hong
Kong economy for strong winds that only hit Cheung Chau . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#50:1>
&ldquo; Why should we have to hire these highly paid civil
servants if they only rely on the machines and take the easy way out ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#51:1>
There is no one to monitor their performance .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#52:1>
We need to find out what is wrong with the Observatory .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#53:1>
The business cost in Hong Kong is already very high: we have already
lost a lot over their mistakes . </p> <O> A photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#54:1>
<bold> Satellite images and charts plotting Typhoon Yutu  ' s
progress , above , can help map out a probable course , but as Yutu showed ,
not all typhoons are easily predictable .

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#57:1>
Mr Tien wrote to Observatory director Lam Hung-kwan on Saturday ,
asking why the authorities in Macau and Shenzhen did not issue similar
typhoon warnings for Yutu . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#58:1>
However , legislator Henry Wu King-cheong , representing the
broking sector , said the Observatory  ' s decision to hoist the No 8 signal
for Yutu was acceptable .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#59:1>
&ldquo; As a member of the business sector , of course we want to
minimise the economic loss during typhoons; bur as a member of the community
, we also have to be concerned about public safety . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#60:1>
Vice-chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour
Union , Poon Siu-ping , also supported the Observatory  ' s decision regarding
Yutu , as it had taken account public safety .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#61:1>
He renewed a call for legislation to govern the working arrangements
between employers and employees during typhoons and rainstorms . Currently ,
the Labour Department only issues guidelines to employers , urging them to
make arrangements in advance . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#62:1>
The federation surveyed more than 600 workers last week and found
that more than 40 per cent of them said they had no such arrangements set
down in their contracts . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#63:1>
The survey , to be released later this week , also found that
nine out of 10 respondents supported having legislation requiring such
arrangements with employers concerning work during typhoons .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#64:1>
A spokesman for the Labour Department said it would be inappropriate
for the Government to legislate on uniform work arrangements during bad
weather because each industry had its own particular needs . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#65:1>
Facing criticism from the community , Dr Lam maintained he and
his team had made the right decision in hoisting the No 8 signal for Yutu .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#66:1>
&ldquo; You cannot say it is a mistake; we made the best forecast
based on the information we had at that moment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#67:1>
&ldquo; It would have been disastrous if we had not hoisted the
signal No 8 and the typhoon had made a direct hit on Hong Kong . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#68:1>
Dr Lam recalled how he and his team of scientific officers put
their head together for two nights to monitor the typhoon .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#69:1>
&ldquo; During every typhoon , we work around the clock , days and
nights .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#70:1>
One thing is certain: we always put public safety before anything
else , and there is no compromise .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#71:1>
I am cautious , not over-cautious . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#72:1>
Dr Lam , who joined the Observatory in 1970 and became its head
in 1996 , said the equipment used by the Observatory was now &ldquo; world
class" , but he added it would still be " unrealistic &rdquo; to expect
weather forecasts to be 100 per cent accurate . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#73:1>
Meteorology is not an exact science .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#74:1>
My target is to be 100 per cent accurate .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#75:1>
The science cannot achieve that target at the moment , but it might
do so in eight or 10 years . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#76:1>
The current five-grade storm warning system has not been changed
since it was introduced in 1973 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#77:1>
The system , officially called Tropical Cyclone Warning Signals ,
is mainly based on the wind force blowing in Victoria Harbour , the central
point of Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#78:1>
Under the system , the Observatory will raise a No 1 signal when
the tropical storm is centred within 800km of Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#79:1>
A No 8 signal will be hoisted when gale- or storm-force winds are
expected to blowing in Victoria harbour , with a sustained wind speed of
63-117 km/h . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#80:1>
Dr Lam said the Observatory had conducted a thorough review in
1999 which did not find any public desire for change . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#81:1>
&ldquo; Until now , we still do not see a public consensus for a
change , although there are split views in our community .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#82:1>
Hong Kong people still have to get used to the existing system , and
it would take time for them to adjust to a new one."

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#83:1>
He said although the scientific criteria for hoisting signals had
not been changed , the warning system had been improved in various aspects .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#84:1>
For example , the Observatory can now announce that it will be
hoisting the No 8 signal two hours before it actually does so . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#85:1>
Also , Internet users can click on the official Web site and
easily get access to the wind force in different parts of Hong Kong during
typhoons . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#86:1>
Dr Lam said he would never bend to outside pressure when deciding
whether to hoist a typhoon signal .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#87:1>
&ldquo; I will take those comments as motivation for improvement .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#88:1>
And I will stick to the principle that public safety always come
first . &rdquo; </p>

Fearful of a possible epidemic , the health body seeks more
information </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#95:2>
A leading virologist who heads one of the World Health
Organisation  ' s influenza centres says a failure by mainland officials to
provide sufficient information on the latest bird flu outbreak could hamper
efforts to control any potential epidemic . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#96:2>
Masato Tashiro , director of the WHO  ' s collaborating centre for
influenza in Tokyo , told the <it> South China Morning Post </it> he was
unhappy with the way mainland officials were handling both the bird flu
incidents in Fujian and the recent pneumonia outbreak in Guangdong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#97:2>
&ldquo; Controlling an influenza epidemic is a global matter .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#98:2>
But we do not have much information despite repeated inquiries to the
Ministry of Health .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#99:2>
We are worried that it is a beginning of an epidemic , &rdquo; he
said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#100:2>
The Tokyo centre is one of the four WHO collaborating offices
for influenza .

<ICE-HK:W2B-022#101:2>
The other three are in London , Atlanta and Melbourne . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#102:2>
&ldquo; It is crucial that we know about the transmission route
of the virus - where and when the Hong Kong man and his son caught the virus
, &rdquo; Dr Tashiro said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#103:2>
Speaking from Tokyo yesterday , he added that the WHO and
international scientists should press harder for an opportunity to join the
investigation in China . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#104:2>
Hong Kong  ' s Department of Health confirmed earlier this week
that a 33-year-old Hong Kong man , who died on Monday , and his nine-year-
old son became the first humans infected with H5N1 since 1997 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#105:2>
Moves were stepped up yesterday to test relatives of the man and
his son in Pingtan , Fujian province , where the family gathered for the
Lunar New Year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#106:2>
Dr Tashiro said he was concerned about whether there was any
link among bird flu incidents in Hong Kong farms and parks recently and the
Guangdong pneumonia outbreak . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#107:2>
The WHO has activated the global flu response plan for the first
time since 1997 , when six out of 18 people infected died of a bird flu
strain previously not seen in humans . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#108:2>
Secretary for Health , Welfare and Food Yeoh Eng-kiong said
yesterday: &ldquo; There is no immediate risk of any pandemic and we are on
top of the problem . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-022#110:2>
More than 10 mainland relatives of the Hong Kong family struck
by the bird flu virus have been directed by health officials not to leave
their home town of Jianglou until the results of blood tests carried out
yesterday are known .

&ldquo; Much can be gained if Hong Kong looks beyond its border
to develop with the mainland a regional and national view for the control of
communicable disease , in which the special administrative region is part of
the whole . &rdquo;
