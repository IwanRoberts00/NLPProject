<ICE-HK:S2A-015#1:1:A>
Well a very good evening

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#2:1:A>
Welcome to the Macau Jockey Club  ' s Taipo racecourse <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#3:1:A>
of course we have all racing on the sand tonight ten events and the
going this evening is normal watering <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#4:1:A>
runners behind the barriers for the second event the Trangie
Handicap class six gallopers over a thousand and fifty metres and in the
event coming up we do have a riding change <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#5:1:A>
number one No Money No Honey Robbie Burke replaces Chris Maund <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#6:1:A>
early favourite for the second is number twelve Tai Fat Hero a
surprise favourite I would say <,> for Eric Suen and Francie Naude <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#7:1:A>
we will we will bring you a replay of the first race in around
twenty minutes and first off we have quite a few changes for tonight  ' s
programme <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#8:1:A>
before I give you the changes though I  ' ll go through our
commentators selections for race two <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#9:1:A>
Franko Lau likes the chances of one No Money No Honey to defeat
three Cash and six Buddha Venture <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#10:1:A>
one three six for Franko Lau <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#11:1:A>
Harry Troy going the way of one six nine and ten <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#12:1:A>
No Money No Honey to defeat Buddha Venture Always Good and New Her
Hero his value chance and I like the chances it  ' s not a race I must say I  ' m
very confident about I think it  ' s very tricky room for upset but I  ' ve got
the way of nine Always Good <,> to defeat six Buddha Venture one No Money No
Honey but I do think the value chance in the race and the improver is number
eleven Major Moves <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#13:1:A>
thought he was unsuited over thirteen hundred metres last time and
more importantly I thought he trained up light for that event and he  ' s
certainly put back on the weight this evening and looks a far better horse
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#14:1:A>
so I think we will see a better run from Major Moves and another
important factor is the thousand and fifty metre trip I think this is far
more suitable <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#15:1:A>
he scored on his first two sand placings in his career prior <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#16:1:A>
so I think if we forgive for that last run when I said he did look
a little light I think he might be able to show up at good odds <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#17:1:A>
he was thirty to one he  ' s now down to nineteen <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#18:1:A>
so I  ' m going nine six one with the good value chance number eleven
Major Moves <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#19:1:A>
Quickly go through the changes for tonight  ' s programme in race one
number three Little Big John was withdrawn replaced by the first standby
Yakmaster barrier two with Charlie C F Chan <,>

Lau but first of all it  ' s a very good evening to our race caller for tonight

opening favourite was number twelve Tai Fat Hero <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#36:1:B>

No Money No Honey with the replacement rider on board Robbie Burke <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#37:1:B>
that  ' s drawn gate twelve No Money No Honey but very consistent
over this distance <,>

Kiwi <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#46:1:B>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#47:1:B>

Pain <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#56:1:B>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#58:1:B>

he  ' s um a model of consistency this fellow on the sand surface
Always Good he  ' s never far away and <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#75:1:B>
after missing the start he  ' s been very slow away his past couple
and again he was slow away but <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#76:1:B>
circled the field and with a bit of speed on up front he  ' s
absolutely flown over the final stages to take the prize <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#77:1:B>
dividends posted <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#78:1:B>
here  ' s Steve <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-015#79:1:A>
Number nine Always Good that  ' s his seventh sand victory here
at Macau here at fifty dollars fifty the win he was well supported late <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#80:1:A>
twenty nine dollars the place <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#81:1:A>
ten New Hero fifty dollars number three Cash fifty seven fifty <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#82:1:A>
nine and ten quinellas paid massive one thousand and twenty nine
dollars fifty <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#83:1:A>
the tierce seventeen thousand one hundred and twenty dollars <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#84:1:A>
wouldn't believe he  ' s won by one and a quarter lengths he was
coming that quick three quarters between second and third <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#85:1:A>
and the run time is one o six neat <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#86:1:A>
one o six neat for the thousand and fifty meter trip <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#87:1:A>
so that  ' s a win for Alan Leung and Horace Lam <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#88:1:A>
hard to believe ah fifty metres out they  ' re looked to be about
five or six chances but he was the widest on the track and <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#89:1:A>
came with the run out wide and was too good for the opposition <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#90:1:A>
course New Hero skipping away he  ' s held on well for second and <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#91:1:A>
Cash getting through just ahead of Best Tiger <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#92:1:A>
nine ten three and seven are the numbers for race two we are about

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#93:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#95:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#96:1:A>
the Q one thousand and twenty nine fifty the tierce seventeen

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#97:1:A>
one and a quarter by three quarters <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#98:1:A>
one o six neat <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#99:1:A>
Always Good is owned by Lam Kuk Ching <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#100:1:A>
hard to believe he  ' s actually got away to win by one and a
quarter lengths because coming aroun about the fifty mark they  ' re looked to
be about six winning chances and ah you didn't think any horse would win by
that margin <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#101:1:A>
but in front here ah New Hero he  ' s just been able just to get ah
the edge here and um as you can see there are so many horses running on <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#102:1:A>
just out of room for the inside was Buddha Venture it just took
him a little while to wind up so he hasn't been far away <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#103:1:A>
you  ' ve got to look for the widest runner on your screen Always
Good he eventually ah overpowers New Hero and just coming with ah Always Good
has been Cash in the blue cap <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-015#104:1:B>
He  ' s rattled home late um Cash but not as quick Always Good
who  ' s absolutely swamped them and ah Buddha Venture so it  ' s ah anyone  ' s
race as you say inside the final fifty or sixty <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#105:1:B>
Tenor Forever <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#106:1:B>
he was hard ridden in the early part after a moderate getaway but
he showed plenty of speed tonight to take up the running and <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#107:1:B>
Tenor Forever nicely clear from New Hero in third Best Tiger a bit
deep then the gray Fly So Free <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#108:1:B>
No Money No Honey slowly away today and had to do plenty of work
in the early stages <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#109:1:B>
and also Tai Fat Hero the horse that did open favourite <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#110:1:B>
there he is whizzing around the outside of the field to go up
towards this leader Tenor Forever <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#111:1:B>
now <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#112:1:B>
Tenor Forever he was fair dinkum <,> flat as a biscuit throughout
and he was under the whip coming near the turn <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#113:1:B>
New Hero getting to him with Tai Fat Hero they were a mile in
front of the rest <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-015#114:1:B>
if anything was entitled to run on you would think would finish
over the top of them it would be the likes of No Money No Honey or or Always
Good who does possess a pretty strong finish <,> </I>
