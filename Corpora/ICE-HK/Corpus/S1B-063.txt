<ICE-HK:S1B-063#181:1:A>
In the plaintiff  ' s

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#182:1:A>
Now please look at the content of this document and tell us when
you have finished <O> Cantonese translation </O> <&> Recording fast-forwards
</&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-063#183:1:A>
Now please tell us whether there was any arrangement between
the management committee and the plaintiff company <,,> concerning the work
referred to in this document <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X184:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-063#185:1:A>
Can you please tell us what was the arrangement

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X186:1:Z>
Every month eight hundred dollars would be charged for <,,>
cleaning of any pipe </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-063#187:1:A>
Undoubted this part of part of the pipe that my learned
friend is not challenging being part of the common pipes so

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X188:1:Z>
You said every month eight hundred dollars will be charged that

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X189:1:Z>
Yes </X> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-063#190:1:A>
Tell us why the management committee is agreeable to such an
<{> <[> arrangement </[>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X191:1:Z>
<[> Well </[> </{> is that to my concerned </X> <&> Recording
fast-forwards </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-063#192:1:A>
Well my learned friend is asking me to stick to and part of
my case is on quantum meruit basis and the charges must be reasonable

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#193:1:A>
Uhm there must be a reason in support of the charges whether <{>
<[> or not </[>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X194:1:Z>
<[> But </[> </{> see I mentioned this last week I I mean I  ' m
now hear what you have to say about <unc> a few words </unc> later on
but you may have some difficulty to a quantum meruit case cos the evidence
shows something was expressly agreed both what should be done and its amount
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-063#195:1:A>
Yes Your Honour

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X196:1:Z>
Different different fact which you expressly agreed work should
be done without agreement that had made as to the cost thereof </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-063#197:1:A>
Yeah Your Honour as I as far I can see the there are two
alternative parts in the plaintiff  ' s case one is that there was an expressed
ad hoc agreement as such concerning the uh pipes which is over and <.> a </.>
above the budget

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X198:1:Z>
That  ' s not the plaintiff  ' s case

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X199:1:Z>
The plaintiff  ' s case is you owe us money partly because of the
expressed agreement in writing eighth of June eighty nine as you paid out to
honour the debit <unc> one word </unc> submitted

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X200:1:Z>
<unc> two words </unc> alternative there are certain
items which we were talking <unc> three words </unc> quantum meruit
basis

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X201:1:Z>
Did you ask us to do from time to time

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X202:1:Z>
The difficulty you may <unc> a few words </unc> I  ' m not
saying there  ' s more to state </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-063#203:1:A>
Uhm

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X204:1:Z>
Uh it is that it seems to be the subject matter no second
agreement </X> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-063#205:1:A>
Yes

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X206:1:Z>
Uh uh what they agreed in fact in fact is the case </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-063#207:1:A>
Mr Loong then could you assist us <,> to see if you can
remember since when <,> was this arrangement <,> came into operation <O>
Cantonese translation </O> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X208:1:Z>
Indeed all right I can't remember </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-063#209:1:A>
Mr Loong I appreciate that we are talking about the matters

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#210:1:A>
I  ' m not asking you to remember the exact date

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#211:1:A>
At least you can try to see if you can give us some idea as to
roughly the year <,> or roughly whether it was before or after the present
management contract <,> whether it was close to the commencement of the
occupation of this building

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#212:1:A>

<{> <[> And uh </[>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X223:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X225:1:Z>
Yes </X> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-063#226:1:A>
Now the drainage problem of <indig> chat gei </indig> <&>
name of a shop </&> <,> was it something that that uh <,,> cut them off

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#227:1:A>
Was it a problem that surfaced very soon after you took up your
post as the chairman or was it something that happened uh later in the course
of managing this building <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X228:1:Z>
Uh the pipes at <indig> chat gei </indig> and Foreign were two
special trouble pipes </X>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X229:1:Z>
When did the troubles start </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-063#230:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X231:1:Z>
I beg your pardon </X>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X232:1:Z>
When did the trouble with these pies start </X> <O> Cantonese
translation </O> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X233:1:Z>
Before I became the chairman </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-063#234:1:A>
And do do you remember after becoming the chairman <,,> did
you try to tackle this problem <,> soon after your election

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#235:1:A>
Or did you only try it months later <&> Recording fast-forwards
</&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X236:1:Z>
After the election </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-063#237:1:A>
And in order to deal with this problem did you discuss with
the plaintiff company <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X238:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-063#239:1:A>
And what was the result of such discussion event <&>
Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X240:1:Z>
At the initial stage whenever the pipe was blocked it would be
cleared immediately

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X241:1:Z>
And then uhm we had to pay charges depending on how many uh times
the pipe had been cleaned

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X242:1:Z>
Later as we had no idea how many times the pipe would burst in a
month <,> so it was agreed that an amount would be paid monthly <,> for all
the cleanings in the month </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-063#243:1:A>
Now perhaps you can then help us

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#244:1:A>
Can you tell us roughly the time gap between the first arrangement
of charging per cleaning and then the subsequent arrangement of a fixed
charge per month

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X245:1:Z>
A short period of time </X> <O> Cantonese answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X246:1:Z>

The arrangement that you have just told us covering the two
documents at page thirty six and thirty eight

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#282:1:A>
Was it an arrangement that was already existing at the time you
negotiate the current management agreement with the plaintiff at page five to

Yes well indeed we uh we have sent out uhm quite a number of
letters to all newly formed incorporated owners

Because unlike uhm the other management uh properties management
companies we have no linkage with any developers

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X504:3:Z>
We are independent

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X505:3:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#530:3:A>
The relevance is to prevent any allegation from the defendant
on our purported lack of duty

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X531:3:Z>
There is no claim or damages or the claim was sums of money
liquidated themselves

<ICE-HK:S1B-063#X532:3:Z>
Did you say you are entitled to it because the company was
totally on a quantum maruit basis </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-063#533:3:A>
Your Honour particular four of paragraph ten refers to the
loss of benefit to the contract

no prayer for damages as I say

<unc> one word </unc> you wanted to show <unc> a few words
</unc> to the contract </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-063#542:3:A>
