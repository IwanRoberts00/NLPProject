<h> <bold> A Chinese Wedding </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#2:1>
For as long as Amy could remember , Chinese had meant food: spring
rolls , fried rice , <indig> mushu </indig> pork &scol; one from Column A and
two from Column B &scol; the Ho Sai Gai on Race Street in Chinatown , its
name spelt out in spiky , bamboo letters on the garish violet and vermilion
neon sign that flashed all night above its red doors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#3:1>
And now - sitting in the midst of the wedding banquet watching
hundreds of Cantonese apply themselves to a heaped platter of food the menu
calls  '  Four seasons starter  '  - now that she has spent several months in Hong
Kong , living with a Chinese family the whole time &scol; now , in fact ,
that she has just married a Chinese man &obrack;  here she looks across the table to
where he is leaning over to talk to her mother , his shoulders square under
the hired tuxedo jacket and his stiff black hair swept back , held in place
by gel , his face already brick red from the brandy - now she knows that in
one respect she was absolutely right: the Chinese , at least the six million
who live in Hong Kong , are totally absorbed by the getting , the preparation
, the presentation and , most important of all , the consumption of food .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#4:1>
Do other people make eating such a central part of their culture ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#5:1>
She wonders , smoothing the heavy brocaded red silk of the wedding
dress over her thighs .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#6:1>
Not the Irish , that  ' s for sure: Uncle Mike would eat his own shoes
if you sat him down at the table and served them to him covered with ketchup .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#7:1>
And if you gave him a few beers to wash them down with , he  ' d
probably smack his lips and ask for more . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#8:1>
The Italians maybe: pasta , pasta , pasta , though , and cheese or
tomato on everything , at least in South Philadelphia .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#9:1>
People always claimed to know the best places - little family-run
restaurants , tucked away in a side-street - a little nervous , it  ' d be dusk
and people would seem to be staring , it was a tough neighbourhood .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#10:1>
Finally , you  ' d come to a dusty glass door that looked as though it
had been sealed since Christmas and realize with a sinking heart and a twinge
of hunger that the place was closed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#11:1>
Here , she admits to herself , she is thinking of Richard: he
always said he knew the best restaurant , the latest place , be it Italian or
Ethiopian , always swore it was the only one to go to , then could never find
it , or it would be shut .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#12:1>
'Sorry , sorry, ' he  ' d say in that blurry , nasal rush ,'too bad ,
too bad , ah , ah , unfortunately they  ' re not open. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#13:1>
Irritating man , she thinks .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#14:1>
Thank God he faded away , or thank God I faded him away , turned off
the set and watched him dwindle into a tiny spot like one of the old black
and whites we had when I was a kid. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#15:1>
Amy shifts her backside and tugs surreptitiously at the sides of
the dress , a <indig> <it> kuah </it> </indig> it is called , she has been
told repeatedly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#16:1>
The heavy silk is smotheringly warm and she can feel a sheen of sweat
on her thighs , popping through the pores of the unfamiliar stockings .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#17:1>
She pulls too hard and feels herself starting to slide , the silk
<indig> <it> kuah </it> </indig> slipping easily over the vinyl of the seat .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#18:1>
She clutches the sides of the chair and digs the stiletto heels into
the carpet to check herself , then slides carefully back into an upright
position. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#19:1>
She looks around but nobody has noticed &scol; most of the people
on the other tables seem to be too busy eating .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#20:1>
Anyway , even if she had disappeared under the table , all the
Chinese would just assume she was drunk .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#21:1>
All <indig> <it> gweilos </it> </indig> , foreign devils , are drunks
, it seems , even the women &scol; so her prospective sisters-in-laws had
told her , the two eldest , the nasty ones , the ugly sisters. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#22:1>
Amy glances to he left .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#23:1>
Winston  ' s second eldest sister , Mei Yoke , is sitting one place
away from her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#24:1>
Their eyes meet and Mei Yoke stares back unblinking so that Amy
finally looks away from the pockmarked , heavily powered mask , thinking
&scol; She really doesn't like me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#25:1>
What did I ever do to her? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#26:1>
Composing herself , she picks up her glass of hot tea and takes a
deliberate , dainty sip . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#27:1>
A fine omen that would be , anyway , the bride disappearing under
the table during the first course .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#28:1>
From the evidence of the elaborate preparations to ensure good luck
for the wedding - the consultations with the astrologer , the peculiar
rituals , the endless worries about auspicious timing - the Lees would cancel
the whole thing .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#29:1>
They would probably pack her back to Philadelphia in one of the
crates they use at the factory , the box simply marked in huge red Chinese
characters ,  ' unlucky bride ' . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#30:1>
A giggle building up inside , slightly hysterical , threatens to
burst out , chasing her racing thoughts upward .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#31:1>
She smothers it with a cough and something catches at the back of her
throat so that she has to hack a few times to get it out .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#32:1>
She feels a heavy hand clap her on the back and turns with a smile ,
nodding her thanks to win  ' s mother &scol; to her new mother-in-law , she
should say .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#33:1>
They haven't really been married , not in a church , but who  ' s
counting ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#34:1>
Only my mother , Amy thinks ruefully . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#35:1>
She smiles again , nodding her head foolishly , muttering <it>
<indig>  ' M'goi , m'goi ' </indig> </it> ,'thank you , thank , you ' , under
her breath , the only Cantonese words with which she feels safe .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#36:1>
Win  ' s mother smiles back , nodding her head , flashing her gold
tooth .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#37:1>
As always she looks a little alarmed when Amy addresses her in
Cantonese , as though afraid that she won't understand a word her new
daughter-in-law is saying and will be forced to sit there smiling mutely like
a fool until someone breaks into help. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#38:1>
'Is everything all right? ' Win asks from , across the table ,
looking up from his conversation with Amy  ' s mother , an expression of
concern on his face that causes something down in he region of Amy  ' s stomach
to flop over with happiness . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#39:1>
'No , no, ' she says , waving her hand in the air , almost
toppling over the glass of tea with the long sleeve of the <it> <indig> kuah
</indig> </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#40:1>
'I  ' m fine .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#41:1>
It  ' s just a frog in the throat. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#42:1>
'A frog? ' says Win slowly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#43:1>
He looks stunned by the brandy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#44:1>
'You know, ' everyone else is listening to their conversation ,  ' a
catch , a rasp , a burr , a frog in the throat.'

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#45:1>
She gestures vaguely at her own neck , this time wary of the swinging
sleeve. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#46:1>
'Yes , I see. ' Win purses his lips .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#47:1>
'It  ' s probably heatiness .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#48:1>
Take a drink , some tea , that will help. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#49:1>
He speaks rapidly to his mother who immediately pushes her own
glass of tea towards Amy , sucking the tablecloth up in her haste , nodding
again and smiling .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#50:1>
Amy shakes her head , smiling back: they must look like a couple of
those stupid dogs that sit in the back of cars and wag their heads. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#51:1>
'No , thanks , I  ' m fine now , really. <indig> <it>

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#52:1>
M'oi , m'oi .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#53:1>
Yi ga ho </it> . </indig>  '  </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#54:1>
Mrs Lee looks dubious , obviously finding the attempt at
Cantonese indecipherable as usual , so Amy carefully takes a sip of her own
tea , smiling again and patting herself on the sternum to show she has
recovered , pushing the proffered glass back across the table . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#55:1>
Apparently mollified , Mrs Lee turns back to her plate. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#56:1>
What am I supposed to call her anyway ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#57:1>
Amy wonders , Mom ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#58:1>
Mrs Lee ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#59:1>
I don't even know her Christian name &scol; not that she has one , of
course , not being Christian .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#60:1>
She probably doesn't even have a real first name either .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#61:1>
The Chinese put their personal names after the family name , that Amy
realized before .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#62:1>
Fair enough .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#63:1>
But to complicate things , they usually also have two personal names
, which are sometimes used together , sometimes separately , sometimes not at
all , as in the case of close relatives who often call each other by their
rank in the family: third uncle on mother  ' s side , or whatever , which
sounds clumsy in English but manages to fit into one word in Cantonese .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#64:1>
Take Mei Yoke .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#65:1>
Her family name is Lee , of course , like Win , and her personal name
, Mei Yoke , comes after that , though family and friends usually drop the
first part and just call her  ' Yoke ' .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#66:1>
Her younger brothers though call her  '  <indig> Jie </indig>  '  for
elder sister. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#67:1>
All of which leaves Amy , blessed with only her paltry single ,
cropped little American name , feeling rather inadequate .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#68:1>
And , to make things worse , all the Lees call her  '  <indig> A-mee'
</indig> , which she was told by a giggling Mei Mei , the youngest daughter ,
sounds something like <fnr>  ' noodlina'.* </fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#69:1>
Amy remembers the first time Win tried to teach her to say his
name , early on &scol; the first time they really talked , in fact , over a
cup of coffee in Hardees .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#70:1>
She had asked what exactly he did in Hong Kong and he had fumbled in
his wallet and produced a business card with his name on it: Winston G.F .
Lee , Senior Executive , Tong Fat Electrical and Toys Manufacturer , then an
address in Hong Kong. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#71:1>
'What does the G.F . stand for? ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#72:1>
&ldquo; Winston Gah Fatt Lee, ' he  ' d said .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#73:1>
It was a grey winter afternoon , all the lamps on already though it
was only three o'clock , the light bleeding out of the day outside. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#74:1>
'That  ' s my full name .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#75:1>
My Chinese name and my western name. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#76:1>
'Say it again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#77:1>
The Chinese part in the middle. ' She had called him win until then.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#78:1>
'Gah Fatt. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#79:1>
'Um ... gay fat, ' she repeated after him. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#80:1>
'You are teasing me. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#81:1>
'No , no , I  ' m just trying to say it right. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#82:1>
'Not &ldquo; Gay" .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#83:1>
It  ' s &ldquo; gah" , like g with &ldquo; ah &rdquo; after it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#84:1>
Like what you say at the doctor  ' s office: ahhhhh .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#85:1>
And it  ' s not &ldquo; fat &rdquo; like Buddha either , it sounds like
&ldquo; father &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#86:1>
The beginning of &ldquo; father &rdquo;. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#87:1>
'Gaah Faat. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#88:1>
'That  ' s better , yes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#89:1>
Try once more. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#90:1>
'Gaahhhh Faaaaaat.'

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#91:1>
She rolls out the sounds , gurgling a little. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#92:1>
'Now you are teasing again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#93:1>
You sound like you are a dog. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#94:1>
'Who are you calling a dog , buster?'

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#95:1>
She pokes him in the arm lightly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#96:1>
'That  ' s not a nice thing to say to a lady in this country , you
know. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#97:1>
'I wanted to say that you sound like you are calling a dog. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#98:1>
'Sound like a dog ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#99:1>
Look like a dog .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#100:1>
You really know how to complement a girl .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#101:1>
Woof , woof! ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#102:1>
He had given her a baffled smile and picked up his coffee cup .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#103:1>
After a while , she had held the card up in the air again and said:  ' What  ' s
this toy company? ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#104:1>
'My family business. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#105:1>
'So you  ' re rich ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#106:1>
That  ' s good. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#107:1>
'No , we have no money , business is very bad .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#108:1>
The recession here in America means no one is buying toys. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#109:1>
'Just toys ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#110:1>
It says electrical , too. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#111:1>
'Electrical things too , yes. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#112:1>
'Oh. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#113:1>
She  ' d looked at the card again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#114:1>
The flip side was covered with Chinese writing , three large
characters in the middle , the rest smaller , strung in scratchy columns down
the right-hand side. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#115:1>
'If it wasn't for the characters , no one would ever know you
were Chinese .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#116:1>
Do you always write your name Winston G.F . Lee , or is that just
for America? ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#117:1>
'No , that is how I always write it on the card. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#118:1>
'Winston G.F . Lee, ' she repeats .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#119:1>
'You could be a second hand car salesman from Atlanta or someplace ,
you know: &ldquo; Winston Lee , pleased to meetcha an take a lookee rite heer
at this lil beauty , not a scratch on her , only two thousand on the clock
and a fresh set of whitewalls I put on myself just yesterday." ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#120:1>
He had smiled at her again with a puzzled but , she noticed then
for the first time , affectionate look: after that he always smiled at her
jokes &scol; sometimes he even laughed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#121:1>
'Then you  ' d tell them, ' she had continued ,  ' if you were this
Winston Gaylord Farmington &obrack;  his mama  ' s name , of course &cbrack; Lee , you  ' d tell  ' em:
&ldquo; The owner was a preacher , ya see , never used the car , bicycled
around town .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#122:1>
It was his second car , anyway , his wife  ' s car , and she never
drove on account she was confined to a wheelchair , wasting disease ,
couldn't drive , a terrible tragedy .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#123:1>
Only five-ninety-nine to you . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#124:1>
She flourished the empty plastic cup. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#125:1>
'And then you  ' d have made a sale .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#126:1>
Maybe you should think about taking up that line of work .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#127:1>
It  ' s a lot easier than beating your brains out to get an MBA ,
isn't it? ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#128:1>
Oh no , he  ' d replied , seriously , the degree was very
important .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#129:1>
He couldn't drop it now , he  ' d already spent so much family money
on it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#130:1>
And anyway , there was no money in second had car sales in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#131:1>
Most people rode motorcycles .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#132:1>
There was only one car per ten thousand people .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#133:1>
He  ' d read the figure in the <it> Far Eastern Economic Review </it>
just last week . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#134:1>
One per ten thousand , she  ' d replied , shocked , that  ' s
amazing .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#135:1>
But hadn't she read somewhere there were more Rolls-Royces per head
than anywhere in the world ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#136:1>
How could that be if there were only , what one hundred cars per ...
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#137:1>
That  ' s the trouble with Hong Kong , he interrupted quickly ,
seeing a glimmer of comprehension in her eyes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#138:1>
It  ' s Rolls-Royce or nothing .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#139:1>
People throw the Mercedes off the docks , just like your Boston Tea
Party. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#140:1>
But she hadn't been listening , had continued talking. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#141:1>
 ' ... million people and there are only a few million there , so
there are only a couple of hundred cars in the whole place ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#142:1>
That can't be right. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#143:1>
And then she saw him smiling broadly and was flabbergasted to
realize that he  ' d made a joke , suckered her completely , sucked her right
in .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#144:1>
She  ' d pretended to be outraged , of course , if only to give him
the pleasure of his coup , but underneath she had been intrigued , it was
something she hadn't expected in him at all &scol; it made him a real person
instead of a curiosity to be examined over a cup of coffee and then dismissed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#145:1>
It was after that joke that she began to like him. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#146:1>
Amy gazes fondly across the table at Win for a second , then
starts , looking at the chopsticks stabbing from all sides towards the dish
at the centre of the table , realizing she hasn't eaten yet .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#147:1>
There are only a few pieces of food left on the plate , most not
immediately identifiable .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#148:1>
She picks up her chopsticks and playing safe , spears one of the
slices of thousand year old egg .

<ICE-HK:W2F-018#149:1>
The taste is rich and musty , the consistence solid but almost slimy
, just on the edge of being disgusting. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-018#150:1>
Amy considers reaching for a piece of the picked ginger that
comes with the eggs , but before she can move a pair of meaty arms reaches
from behind her and unceremoniously whisks away the serving dish so that she
is left waving her chopsticks in empty air. </p>
