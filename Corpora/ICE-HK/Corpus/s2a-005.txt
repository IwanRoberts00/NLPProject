The action for race two

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-005#2:1:B>
<?> Under orders </?> for the second race here at Happy Valley
<,> only a few to move in so let  ' s take you back to David Raphael

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-005#3:1:C>
Thirty three for the favourite country dragon he  ' s been
popular most of the way through the betting in fact all of the way through
the betting <,> but Dragon win continues to trickle down and he  ' s now at
forty one dollars <,> the seven horse Jade Ruyi from eleven a little while
ago to ninety dollars <,> whereas this fella Wealthy Together is a big price
he  ' s over one hundred to one <,> and it  ' s he and Faithful Assurance I
believe the only two runners to move in

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#4:1:C>
So Wealthy Together they work on at the moment <,> Faithful
Assurance went pretty well first up the other day on soft ground he ran
second there <,> he comes into this event and it  ' s a pretty low grade event
as well <,> he  ' s got a wide barrier draw the three horse <,> Simon Yim takes
the ride on him today <,> must be thought of as a major chance and the public
rate him that he  ' s fifty dollars and third favourite <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#5:1:C>
This fellow Wealthy Together does not want to go in <,> now he  ' s at
the back of the gates and they  ' ve got him squared up now <,> he  ' s half way
in <,> couple of extra attendants come around behind and they  ' re just trying
to get him in that last little bit

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#6:1:C>
Looks as though they  ' ve won the battle <,> so he  ' s ready <,>
standby for a start <,> they  ' re all away flag is up and they  ' re racing <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#7:1:C>
Allez Allez slow to go Wealthy Together away only fairly Beloved
Partner began very well <,> Country Dragon booting up and between the pair
Flying Magic <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#8:1:C>
Dragon Win with the ears scrubbed off to hold the rail and will do
it for the moment from Country Dragon and out three deep at them Flying Magic
<,> Hot Pot eases behind them and Beloved Partner now dropped back in fifth
and sixth Faithful Assurance outside that brigade <,> Wealthy Together next
from Money Star Nazakat the second Team Tonic Allez Allez <,> Jade Ruyi
dropped to last of all at the twelve hundred metre mark <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#9:1:C>
Country Dragon pushes on and will go to the top <,> Dragon Win drops
in second Flying Magic third <,> a length Hot Pot the middle from Faithful
Assurance posted three deep <,> and Beloved Partner three back the rail <,> a
length and a half Wealthy Together by the thousand <,> on the inside Nazakat
the second <,> three lengths Money Star Team Tonic <,> Jade Ruyi outside
Allez Allez last of all <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#10:1:C>
Country Dragon leads at the half mile they  ' re half way <,> the
margin a length Dragon Win second Flying Magic ahead three deep now third and
posted there <,> Beloved Partner the rails getting up to be behind the
leading brigade from Hot Pot <,> Faithful Assurance a length and a half
Wealthy Together Nazakat the second <,> next then Money Star out three wide
pushing on Jade Ruyi <,> he  ' s still eight to ten off the lead he  ' d want to
get a move on <,> Allez Allez underneath him and last of all is Team Tonic
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#11:1:C>
Around the circle <,> Country Dragon travels well by a length <,>
second under pressure Dragon Win Beloved Partner going for the run in the
middle <,> it comes but will he kick hard <,> they  ' ve gone two lengths to
Faithful Assurance Jade Ruyi still runs on four off them <,> Country Dragon
one paced in front Dragon Win  ' s at his girth <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#12:1:C>
He  ' s trying to get closer <,> Jade Ruyi staying on at Beloved
Partner for third <,> Country Dragon puts his grate he keeps on going <,>
Country Dragon too good for Dragon Win Jade Ruyi third <,> that  ' s the way
they finish <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#13:1:C>
Country Dragon by a length and a half <,> Dragon Win second <,> out
wide Jade Ruyi continued to stay on well and made ground third <,> Nazakat
the second next followed by Beloved Partner Allez Allez <,> Faithful
Assurance Hot Pot Money Star Team Tonic <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#14:1:C>
Wealthy Together and Flying Magic leads the flying carpet he was
last of all <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#15:1:C>
Country Dragon too good number one is first <,> the price was short
but he won well <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#16:1:C>
He pressed forward from gate two

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#17:1:C>
He used the position well <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#18:1:C>
He was the leader on the circuit and he was just too good for them
today <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#19:1:C>
Got a good pat down the shoulder as well as holds a good length and
a half margin on Dragon Win <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#20:1:C>
He doesn't do it quickly but he does stay on and for this grade
that  ' s an effort <,> normally they  ' re done at the four hundred but Dragon
Win was one paced but he just keeps on battling on in that position <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#21:1:C>
He  ' s done his best to finish in second and Jade Ruyi who  ' s come
from last at the seven hundred metre mark has had to loop around the field
<,> and has continued to stay on well for third <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#22:1:C>
It was a solid effort by him and let  ' s remember he  ' s got a horse
that  ' s got a nine and zip record <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#23:1:C>
So they  ' re low grade but someone  ' s got to win them <,> the public
thought that Country Dragon had his chance

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#24:1:C>
It  ' s been a good effort by Tony Cruz to produce him fresh <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#25:1:C>
First up for him he  ' s been able to win <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#26:1:C>
Five second Dragon Win officially <,> seven Jade Ruyi third <,> and
Beloved Partner who was there on the corner looked to have had every chance
on face value to hold his position <,> but he  ' s not great over the sixteen
fifty and he just battled on the final stages finishing in fourth <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#27:1:C>
It was a one forty one point one run <,> and the dividends are
thirty five and fourteen fifty <,> so five to two the winner <,> sixteen for
the runner up <,> twenty two for third <,> popular quinella at sixty five
dollars and a tierce dividend is still to come through

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#28:1:C>
So it  ' s one five seven and two <,> two races down <,> two
favourites home <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-005#29:1:B>
Yes <,> both bearing the saddle cloth number one <,> <?> spent
</?> a bit of time up front they  ' ve come home very slow <,> one forty one
one <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#30:1:B>
They were on target to get under the class record the way they were
going up to the half way point <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#31:1:B>
They broke twenty eight seconds early and that was Country Dragon
pressing the leader and eventually rolling <,> and then he broke twenty four
seconds uh from the twelve to the eight hundred metres so he really went
along and earned earned his victory here tonight

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#32:1:B>
Here  ' s the tierce <,> it  ' s paid eight hundred and twenty dollars
<,> eight hundred and twenty dollars the tierce <,> on one five and seven <,>
only a handful of chances so it seems to be a reasonable pay out <,> with the
quinella sixty five dollars <,> sixty five even <,> fourth home was number
two Beloved Partner <,,> <&> Commercial Break </&>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-005#33:1:B>
We don't always see the races pan out like that with leaders
working that hard to eventually get across and then uh you  ' ve got a fairly
strong horse on your back Dragon Win <,> eight times out of ten the strong
horse would come off your back and beat you <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-005#34:1:A>
He  ' s an eighteen hundred metre horse though isn't he <,> and
I think that  ' s uh a simple case of a <,> miler who  ' s beaten a mile and a
quarter horse here and a mile and a quarter horse was never quick enough to
really <,> get and lay down a challenge <,> it didn't really matter how quick
Country Dragon went if he got the mile he was going to win it <,> it was a
question of if he didn't get the mile then the other horse would have keep uh
kept galloping and would have come over the top of him but uh no I think they  ' ve
probably done their homework pretty much nigh on right here <,> they  ' ve uh
decided that the mile is his trip they  ' ll go out and make him get every yard
of it and its worked out nicely for them <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#35:1:A>
First run as you say for Tony Cruz Felix Coetzee aboard and uh just
another well rated ride ride by Felix Coetzee <,> we  ' ve said it so many
times in the past <,> let  ' s hope we say it plenty of times again this season
<,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-005#36:1:B>
So that  ' s win number three of the season now for Tony Cruz
<,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-005#37:1:A>
He  ' s had very few unplaced horses out of his runners this
season so far <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-005#38:1:B>
A uh yeah he  ' d be <,> he is a trainer that  ' s entitled to
blow up with a hard luck story <,> six seconds <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-005#39:1:A>
Mmmmm

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-005#40:1:B>
And one third <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-005#41:1:A>
He  ' s uh come pretty close to winning in the big race last
weekend of course with Red Sun <,> he just got run out of things but uh all
in all <,> the yard is in great form the horse are firing on all cylinders
and uh well Tony will be more than happy to see this one come home by what a
length and a half <,> just about that <,> over Dragon Win <,> Jade Ruyi doing
all his best work in the closing stages <,> just a slight worry there about
how much improvements left <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#42:1:A>
Beloved Partner <,> be interested in him next time back over 1400
at Sha Tin that should uh suit him

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-005#43:1:B>
Money Star went awful <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-005#44:1:A>
Mmmmm didn't he <,> didn't he just <,> Yes <,> he  ' s a <,>
certainly going to have to drop down the handicap to see him with a winning
chance <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-005#45:1:B>
At least the other fancied runner had some excuse Faithful
Assurance <,> he was caught three wide <,> from his wide draw without cover
<,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-005#46:1:A>
The ground was the worry though wasn't it <,> you know how
many times have uh you seen that a horse that really wants cut in the ground
when he gets on a firmer surface <,> and in all fairness Darren he actually
didn't look the part here tonight <,> Whereas last uh weekend he looked great
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#47:1:A>
Well the winner comes out of gate two <,> all the speed was down
the inside <,> gates one and two <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-005#48:1:C>
Flag is up and they  ' re racing <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#49:1:C>
Allez Allez slow to go Wealthy Together away only fairly <,>
Beloved Partner began very well <,> Country Dragon booting up and between the
pair Flying Magic <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-005#50:1:C>
Dragon Win with the ears scrubbed off to hold the rail and will do
it for the moment from Country Dragon and out three deep at them Flying Magic
<,> Hot Pot eases behind them and Beloved Partner now dropped back in fifth
and sixth Faithful Assurance outside that brigade <,> Wealthy Together next
