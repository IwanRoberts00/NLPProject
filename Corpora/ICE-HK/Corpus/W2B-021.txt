<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#4:1>
<bold> Here is a bit </bold> of information I could have done with
a couple of weeks ago .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#5:1>
There I was sitting around with a group of parents and the talk turned
, as it naturally does , to Japanese encephalitis .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#6:1>
You what ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#7:1>
You don't have teenage kids about to go off on yet another school
excursion ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#8:1>
Well for those who don't , the Japanese encephalitis vaccination has
become a must-have for young travelers to the Thai-Cambodia border .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#9:1>
The disease is endemic to China &obrack;  including Hong Kong &cbrack; and Southeast
Asia but people have only recently begun to have vaccination against it .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#10:1>
Anyway back to my story .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#11:1>
One child had been given just one dose , instead of the requisite two
, in the recommended time before travel . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#12:1>
This can be a serious problem because in a small number of cases
there is a delayed allergic reaction to the vaccine .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#13:1>
If you  ' re in an isolated valley when that allergy kicks in it can be
serious . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#14:1>
So what to so , asked the concerned mother ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#15:1>
Should she tell her daughter &ldquo; no shot no trip" , allow her to
go if she promised to cover every inch of mosquito-attracting skin at all
times or would the one shot be effective ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#16:1>
My answer was to cover every inch of skin anyway because the
mosquitoes in that part of the world carry the nastiest and most
drug-resistant strain of malaria known . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#17:1>
But I really could have done with the book on travel tips the
World Health Organization &obrack;  WHO &cbrack; released last week . Entitled <it>
International Travel and Health </it> , it examines all kinds of illnesses
and health problems a traveller may encounter , complete with handy &ldquo;
disease map" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#18:1>
It has also established a Web site &obrack;  http://www.who.int.ith/ &cbrack; ,
which is well worth a visit before you make any travel plans . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#19:1>
However , fears of disease were quickly dispelled as the site
explains that by far the biggest cause of death and illness when travelling
is one for which we are yet to find a solution . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#20:1>
I  ' ll let the author explain .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#21:1>
&ldquo; Travellers are more likely to be killed or injured in
accidents or through violence than to be struck down by an exotic infectious
disease , &rdquo; they say .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#22:1>
&ldquo; Traffic accidents are the most frequent cause of death among
travellers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#23:1>
Traffic accidents and violence are significant risks in many
countries , particularly developing countries , where skilled medical care
may not be readily available .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#24:1>
Accidents and injuries also occur in other settings , particularly in
recreational waters in association with swimming , diving , sailing and other
activities .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#25:1>
Travellers can reduce the possibility of incurring these risks
through awareness of the dangers and by taking the appropriate precautions .
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#26:1>
According to the WHO more than one million people were killed and
10 million injured worldwide in traffic accidents in 1998 alone .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#27:1>
So what to do ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#28:1>
It has a handy list of tips &obrack;  see panel right &cbrack; , although most are
blindingly obvious .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#29:1>
In fact , they sound like a list our civil servants would warn us
about &obrack;  don't throw your TV set out of high windows , etc &cbrack; . </p>

<bold> CONTACT LENSES </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#32:2>
<bold> Dr Margaret Cheng </bold> mharris@netvigator.com </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#33:2>
<bold> Ever wondered what your contact </bold> lenses do while
you are sleeping ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#34:2>
No ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#35:2>
Bad luck .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#36:2>
I  ' m going to tell you anyway .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#37:2>
They are supposed to be quietly soaking in disinfectant solution and
getting themselves into pristine condition for another day of sitting on your
eyeballs .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#38:2>
But some , according to a study recently published in the British
Journal of Ophthalmology , may be soaking in a nasty micro-organism called
acanthamoeba . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#39:2>
Now this acanthamoeba , as the name suggests , belongs to those
wondrous single-celled creatures we all met under the microscope in
elementary science . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#40:2>
According to the experts , our water and soils are teeming with
these denizens of the evolutionary depths .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#41:2>
And just in case you wondered why these things are still around while
dinosaurs have been and gone , the scientists have found they are very good
at protecting themselves . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#42:2>
While the active cells , technically known as trophozoites , are
killed by am eight-hour soak in lens disinfectant solution - usually
hydrogen peroxide - that is not enough to knock off these little survivors .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#43:2>
Under what biologists call adverse conditions &obrack;  and a dunk in
hydrogen peroxide is a pretty good example of an adverse condition for an
amoeba &cbrack; acanthamoeba form cysts , hard-walled dormant forms .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#44:2>
And some of these cysts are able to survive a long soak in solutions .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#45:2>
If that  ' s all they did it wouldn't matter to much .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#46:2>
Unfortunately , acanthamoeba can cause serious eye infection , and
are especially likely to cause it in people who wear soft lenses .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#47:2>
Infection with acanthamoeba can lead to a condition called keratitis
, where the cells lining the eye become tough and painful .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#48:2>
This is a difficult condition to treat and can lead to blindness in
severe cases . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#49:2>
Poor lens hygiene - leaving lenses in their cases too long , not
regularly cleaning the lens cases , and not cleaning the lenses properly are
thought to be the main cause of acanthamoeba eye infections . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#50:2>
But if these nasty things can survive a soak in lens solution
what can be done to stop them ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#51:2>
First , most research has found lens solutions kill the active forms
- the cells . Finding one that can kill the cysts is the best approach . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#52:2>
In the British study , the research team tested three types of
soft contact lens cleaning solution: one was a multi-purpose solution now
dominating the market and the other two were both hydrogen peroxide solutions .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#53:2>
One of these was a &ldquo; one-step &rdquo; system and the other
&ldquo; two-step &rdquo; system . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#54:2>
For those not expert in the cleaning of contact lenses , hydrogen
peroxide , a very effective disinfectant , needs to be modified because it is
toxic to the eye .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#55:2>
One-step solutions have a catalyst added to neutralise hydrogen
peroxide . </p> <O> A Photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#56:2>
<bold> Novelty lenses look good , but hygiene should be the major
factor for all contact lens wearers . </bold>

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#57:2>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#58:2>
All the solutions were tested for effectiveness against several
different strains of acanthamoeba at different strengths and for different
times , ranging from 30 minutes to eight hours . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#59:2>
All the solutions had killed the active cells after eight hours .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#60:2>
But the cysts were more difficult to kill .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#61:2>
The two step 0.6 per cent hydrogen peroxide solution was the most
effective .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#62:2>
It killed virtually all the cysts and had killed many after just 30
minutes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#63:2>
The multi-purpose solution - popular with lens users here - was
not as effective as the two-step solution , but did manage to kill off the
cysts of some strains .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#64:2>
So if you have the right strain lurking in your bathroom , your
multi-purpose solution will kill it and its cysts completely . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#65:2>
But the one-step solution was not effective enough .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#66:2>
Cysts of all the kinds of acanthamoeba tested still survived an
eight-hour soaking .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#67:2>
Researchers think this may happen because the catalyst used to
neutralize the hydrogen peroxide also removes its ability to kill off the
cysts . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#68:2>
So what does all this mean for lens wearers ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#69:2>
To be as safe as possible , choose your lens solution carefully .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#70:2>
Read the list of active ingredients and remember the two-step
hydrogen peroxide solutions appear to be the most effective .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#71:2>
And soak your lenses for a long time: eight hours or more . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#72:2>
Pay attention to your lens cases as well .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#73:2>
Because the acanthamoeba live in lens cases , the only way to be sure
you have rid yourself of them is to regularly clean and boil or microwave
your lens cases .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#74:2>
Eye experts recommend you replace them often as well . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#75:2>
The worst thing you can do is leave lenses lying in cases for
days or months and wear them now and again .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#76:2>
If you only wear lenses occasionally , you would be better off buying
disposable lenses and changing them every time you use them . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#81:3>
When my dog rolls on his back , my children insist that it is
going to rain .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#82:3>
Being in Hong Kong , where rainstorms are as common as roadworks ,
they are usually right . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#83:3>
But I  ' m not about to try to sell you a cocker-spaniel weather
predictor here .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#84:3>
What I  ' m talking about this week are the people who can tell , by
the pain in their joints , what the weather is doing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#85:3>
A few weeks ago , a reader sent us an e-mail asking whether
humidity levels had any known effect on arthritis because her joints became
very painful as the moisture in the atmosphere increased . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#86:3>
The answer is yes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#87:3>
Around now , when the humidity increases , mould spreads and moisture
drips on the floors and walls , people with joint pains often start to suffer .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#88:3>
Why is this ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#89:3>
Well there haven't been many systematic studies of this but back in
the 1960s a doctor persuaded a group of people to get into a
climate-controlled chamber for two weeks so he could see whether increases in
the humidity did anything to their joints .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#90:3>
He found humidity makes joint hurt more . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#91:3>
Pain and swelling increased as the water content in the air rose .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#92:3>
But that does not really explain why this happens .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#93:3>
The worst weather combination was a drop in barometric pressure and a
rise in humidity , the kind of conditions seen just before a big thunderstorm .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#94:3>
Later studies have asked people to keep detailed diaries of their
symptoms or put volunteers in climate-controlled chambers and changed their
conditions without telling them .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#95:3>
While not all the studies ' results were conclusive , women seem more
sensitive to humidity and pressure changes than men .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#96:3>
People with osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia are also most likely to
feel an increase in pain as the water level goes up in the atmosphere . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#97:3>
Many people feel very uncomfortable just before a thunderstorm -
migraine sufferers as well as people with arthritis , multiple sclerosis and
old joint injuries often say they feel more pain or are more likely to suffer
when a thunderstorm is imminent . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#98:3>
The drop in barometric pressure is well-accepted as having a
direct effect on tissues in the joints .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#99:3>
As the pressure in the atmosphere drops , gases and tissue in the
joints expand so the already crowded space - filled up with inflamed tissue
and fluid - gets even more cramped . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#100:3>
Pain nerves tell the brain when things are just too cramped or
there is too much pressure on tissue or bone .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#101:3>
So those pain nerves start firing away when the barometric pressure
drops . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#102:3>
It makes sense that the same sort of things goes on when the
humidity starts to climb .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#103:3>
Whether or not you have joint problems , most people feel their
hands and feet swell up and get a general sense of &ldquo; bloating &rdquo;
on those muggy days . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#104:3>
When your hands and feet swell , the places the fluid ends up in
are your joints .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#105:3>
So what can we so about it ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#106:3>
In the past , doctors advised people with climate-sensitive diseases
to move to a warmer , drier place .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#107:3>
In this case it  ' s really just a dry place most people need , but we
can't all emigrate to the Australian outback . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#108:3>
Arthritics , for instance , might arrange to leave Hong Kong
between May to September for a drier , more stable climate .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#109:3>
However this requires a pretty good independent income or a very
understanding boss . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#110:3>
A cheaper , more practical solution is to invest in a
dehumidifier and use it as soon as the humidity levels climb .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#111:3>
Employing more often those strategies that have been effective for
reducing the swelling in your joints - gentle , structured exercises:
massage; postural drainage , for instance - should help counter the weather
attack . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#112:3>
Finally , use the cards fate has dealt you .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#113:3>
You are a good weather predictor - don't let your neighbours and
children tell you otherwise . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#119:4>
<bold> Atypical pneumonia </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#120:4>
First , let me explain what the experts studying atypical
pneumonia and the medical staff treating the virus are saying . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#121:4>
Last week the World Health Organisation &obrack;  WHO &cbrack; held a worldwide
teleconference to allow them to compare notes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#122:4>
It was revealed that almost 1,500 people are known to have had been
infected and it seems to have started in Guangdong some time in November .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#123:4>
Of that figure , close to three per cent have died .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#124:4>
And while this is a serious infection , so far it is not killing a
high percentage of the people it infects . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#125:4>
In other words , don't panic .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#126:4>
Use common sense .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#127:4>
Stay informed , stay calm and follow the advice about keeping your
home and office well ventilated by opening windows; avoiding infection by
staying away from confined , overcrowded spaces &obrack;  lifts , the MTR , buses and
planes); and giving your immune system a chance to fight it off by getting
plenty of sleep and eating plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#128:4>
Experts say the infection takes from two to seven days from the
time of transmission before you show symptoms .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#129:4>
The first sign in most cases is the sudden onset of a high fever &obrack; 
over 38 degrees Celsius &cbrack; . </p> <O> A photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#130:4>
We  ' re talking about a fever that burns you up then , half an
hour later , has you shivering .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#131:4>
You feel so awful it is hard to carry on and the rise in temperature
often gives you a thumping headache across your forehead .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#132:4>
Another symptom common in this condition is a dry cough , as opposed
to the one associated with Hong Kong pollution , or what doctors call a  '   ' productive''
cough , one in which you can hear the phlegm coming up as you cough .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#133:4>
A dry cough is the hacking , sometimes painful variety that brings
up no sputum . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#134:4>
Other things to look out for are myalgia &obrack;  muscle aches and skin
sensitivity that makes it hurt to even have a shower); joint aches;
breathlessness doing things that do not normally make you breathless &obrack;  like
walking , shopping , watching television &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#135:4>
A few people have also had a rash and/or diarrhoea , but these
symptoms are less common .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#136:4>
If you have these symptoms a doctor can work out quickly whether you
have atypical pneumonia by doing a chest X-ray , as it wreaks havoc on the
lungs .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#137:4>
In most cases , symptoms last five to seven days , after which the
victim begins to recover .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#138:4>
But in a percentage of cases the infection deteriorates into a
severe condition that cripples the lungs .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#139:4>
These people need artificial ventilation while they fight the
disease , and some of these are the ones who have died . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#140:4>
According to WHO findings , most of the fatalities were
suffering from other medical conditions that had weakened them in the first
place . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#141:4>
So give your body a chance .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#142:4>
Now more than ever , eat better , sleep more and take exercise .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#143:4>
Walk up the stairs because you don't want to be stuck in a lift ,
stop smoking and drink no more than two standard alcoholic beverages per day .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#144:4>
And what about infection control ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#145:4>
We know about the masks , but what about disinfecting: does it work ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#146:4>
I would say yes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#147:4>
This is a weak virus .

<ICE-HK:W2B-021#148:4>
It needs to live in our body secretions and it needs a fair amount
of that secretion to be breathed in or passed from person to person . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-021#149:4>
If we are meticulous about hand-washing , disinfecting our homes
and utensils , and keeping small children away from one another for a while
we should slow the spread effectively . </p>
