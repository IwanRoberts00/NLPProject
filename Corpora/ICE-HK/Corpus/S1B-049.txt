Southeast Asia as well as uh distribute it in the <,> the form of video
cassette for home viewing

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X17:1:Z>
How many hours of programming a year do you distribute </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#18:1:A>
Oh I think we distribute over thousand hours of these drama
and <.> tele </.> features a year

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X19:1:Z>
Wow that  ' s <,> that  ' s quite a lot

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X20:1:Z>
Is that all uhm <,> uh has they all been broadcasted on TVB in
Hong Kong </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#21:1:A>
Most of them have

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#22:1:A>
But we also produce a certain drama and and uh uh product that are
distributed in video form for oversea market that have not broadcasted on TVB

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X23:1:Z>
Right

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X24:1:Z>
Uhm what about market outside of Asia </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#25:1:A>
We do that too

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#26:1:A>
We distribute our programmes uh mainly to where there are Asian
communities including Chinese uh and a number of other Asian minority groups

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#27:1:A>
Uh for which we have made uh other language version of our
programmes <{> <[> <,> uh </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X28:1:Z>
<[> What </[> </{> languages S K </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#29:1:A>
Uh they include the Vietnamese the Mandarin <,> Cantonese uh
Thai Cambodian Korean <{> <[> <,> </[> Malay and then more

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#30:1:A>
Even more recently you know for the last two years we  ' ve been uh
experimenting with uh English <unc> one- word </unc> Spanish
<unc> one-word </unc> version to our products for European and uh
Latin American market

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X31:1:Z>
<[> Uh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X32:1:Z>
Right

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X33:1:Z>
Uhm <,> uh how do you sell it

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X34:1:Z>
I mean who <,> do you uh to go knocking on the doors of all the TV
stations <&>

<$A> laughs </&> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#35:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#36:1:A>
We do a little bit of that too

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#37:1:A>
Actually for <,> for the Asian communities we distribute mainly to
established channels <,> which mean that we sell packages of programme every
year to to the created licensee that we have uh built up relations with over
the years

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#38:1:A>
And many of these operator <?> either change </?> their video
stores or they license to uh video dealers

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#39:1:A>
Say in the Chinatown of uh the USA uh Canada or the UK et cetera

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#40:1:A>
<{> <[> That  ' s </[> one channel distribution for the uh the

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#41:1:A>
The European <?> clan </?> or the American <?> clans </?> these are
the would be the <?> quotation </?> uh communities

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#42:1:A>
Then uh we distribute soap uh a number of uh uh means of <unc>
one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#43:1:A>
Uh we distribute to appointed distributors who have more programme
to sell to these <?> clans </?> that we do

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#44:1:A>
Because we will be

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#45:1:A>
I supposed uh really uh one of these suppliers of uh <unc>
two-words </unc> programme

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#46:1:A>
Because they would be the main stream <?> quotation </?> audience

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#47:1:A>
That would be one type of channel so we distribute so we distribute
the <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#48:1:A>
Or we would uh uh sell as a several you know TV market like <?> mid
</?> TV in <unc> one-word </unc> or <?> mid </?> home and uh net TV
in the the US

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#49:1:A>
We <?> accept </?> that our products to groups and then we talk to
buyers to <?> combine </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#50:1:A>
And we also write to certain stations and send them catalogue of
our products

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#51:1:A>
Or we drop in and <,> call on these stations

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#52:1:A>
So it  ' s a mixture of methods

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X53:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X54:1:Z>
Right

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X55:1:Z>
You you uhm said you distribute a lot of a lot of dramas

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X56:1:Z>
Is there uh uh uh description of what is the most popular product

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X57:1:Z>
Uh yeah a specific description of what is the most popular product
to you uhm market </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#58:1:A>
Uh it varies a bit uh for uh different countries and even
within countries sometimes for uh different audiences

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#59:1:A>
Say for instance uh for the uh Chinese community that we sell to uh
overseas uh whether distanced Southeast Asia or say <,> in uh advanced the
Chinese communities in Europe and in North America

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#60:1:A>
They typically uh would enjoy more of uh the drama that are popular
in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#61:1:A>
Because I think their taste are very similar <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#62:1:A>
Whereas for uh some Asian communities say for for example Korea <,>
Thailand or uh Vietnam

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#63:1:A>
Then uh they prefer our costume uh kung fu type the costume uh
action type drama

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#64:1:A>
They  ' re supposed to be uhm more modern costume type drama

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X65:1:Z>
Right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#66:1:A>
And then for uh the <,> western audiences that we are
beginning just beginning to sell to

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#67:1:A>
And we are <,> are beginning to opening uh open up more to them

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#68:1:A>
Uh I think that the our <.> tele </.> features which are <,> movie
<?> link </?> products <,> that are more action orientated

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#69:1:A>
They tend to be preferred

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#70:1:A>
Because A they are shorter rather than our long serial drama

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#71:1:A>
So it  ' s easier for a a <?> quotation </?> audience to sort of try
and get to enjoy it

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#72:1:A>
Secondly I guess action transcend dialogues

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#73:1:A>
So the more action <?> type </?> the uh movie link features tend to
be preferred for these audiences

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#74:1:A>
So varies quite a bit you know

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#75:1:A>
It varies from the very traditional Chinese <,> to the other ethnic
<?> Asians </?> to the sort of <?> quotation </?> is to which <.> pro </.>
which of our programme are preferred

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X76:1:Z>
Right

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X77:1:Z>
Uhm <,> what uhm <,> what  ' s the most popular programme you ever
sold </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#78:1:A>
I think it is hard to uh quantify exactly like that

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#79:1:A>
Because for most of our <,> major market <,> we distribute in a
package <,> which means that we don't sell just <{1> <[1> one single </[1>
drama or one single movie

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#80:1:A>
We would sell typically say a package for a given <{2> <[2> year
</[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#81:1:A>
So many hundred hours <,> of our programme and then we would we
send them

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#82:1:A>
Uh uh we send a licensee master tape of each of these uh programme

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#83:1:A>
And then they in term then sort of duplicated locally and then
distributed to video shops

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#84:1:A>
So it is a bit hard for us to say exactly which is the most popular

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#85:1:A>
<{3> <[3> But </[3> I would think that buy <?> enlarge </?> uh
among the <,> non Cantonese speaking market

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#86:1:A>
I would say that our costume <,> uh kung fu type drama <,> tend to
be more popular

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#87:1:A>
The the the one set were rewritten from sort of classic kung fu
novels that were written uh uh uh years ago tend to more popular <{4> <[4>
<,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#88:1:A>
And among the Cantonese speaking market whereas I think that they
tend to be closer to Hong Kong taste

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#89:1:A>
So those tend to be more <?> the </?> the melodramatic type drama
the soap opera type drama uh tend to be more popular

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X90:1:Z>
<[1> Alright </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X91:1:Z>
<[2> Uh ha </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X92:1:Z>
<[3> Right </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X93:1:Z>
<[4> Right </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X94:1:Z>
Right

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X95:1:Z>
Well S K uhm that  ' s uh that  ' s all we  ' re going to have time for
this time

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X96:1:Z>
But I  ' d like to talk to you again about uh <,> your uhm animation
project <{1> <[1> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X97:1:Z>
So </[1> uh perhaps uh we can talk again in another few weeks <{2>
<[2> <,> alright </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X98:1:Z>
Thanks very <{3> <[3> much </[3> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#99:1:A>
<[1> Sure </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#100:1:A>
<[2> Sure

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#101:1:A>

<I>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X104:2:Z>
Good evening and welcome to Newsline

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X105:2:Z>
My name is Maureen Boyd

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X106:2:Z>
A main subject tonight is labour

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X107:2:Z>
The decision to import nearly fifteen thousand foreign workers
the brain drain and other related issues

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X108:2:Z>
We join tonight by the Secretary for Education and Manpower <,>
Yeung Kai Yin

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X109:2:Z>
Then after the break we  ' ll be joined by labour leader Lee Cheuk
Yan and then by Martin Barrow Chairman of the Hong Kong Tourist Association

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X110:2:Z>
But first let  ' s talk with T L Tsim about some of the events of
the week

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X111:2:Z>
T L

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X112:2:Z>
<unc> one-word </unc> Lady Lily Tang is now a baroness
<{> <[> and she </[> would give her seat in the House of Lords

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X113:2:Z>
There were other honours for Hong Kong citizen

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X114:2:Z>
But one person who didn't get a honour despite prediction to the
contrary was the Attorney-General Jamie Matthew

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X115:2:Z>
T L how <?> importance </?> honours system in a colony

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X116:2:Z>
And I  ' m going to <unc> one-word </unc> on this by saying
that <,> some seats uh may hold part they <?> grew </?> by the royalty of
Hong Kong people to the British government </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#117:2:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#118:2:A>
No I don't think that  ' s true

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#119:2:A>
I have said on many government committees myself

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#120:2:A>
I think people reserve on these committees do so

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#121:2:A>
Because they want to be able <,> to contribute to uhm policy
meeting matters

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#122:2:A>
And uh I don't think <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#123:2:A>
Well perhaps there is the <?> hon </?> one here and there who <,>
who are are serving

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#124:2:A>
Because uh they think at the end of it they will get a <,> a a a
<,> an NBE or OBE

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#125:2:A>
But but most of us <,> are just glad to be there

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#126:2:A>
However this <.> syst </.> system may change in the future <{> <[>
uh </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X127:2:Z>
<[> Would </[> </{> anyone miss it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#128:2:A>
Yes I supposed some people may miss it

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#129:2:A>
Uh it it  ' s nice to be <,> known as an OBE

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#130:2:A>
For instance one of my friends just got one

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#131:2:A>
And I haven't talk to him about it yet

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#132:2:A>
But I  ' m sure it  ' s gone <?> down </?> very well

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X133:2:Z>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X134:2:Z>
Now Derek <?> Davis </?> is the former editor of the Fareast
Economic Review

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X135:2:Z>
And really <?> institute </?> and journalistic cycle <?> right
</?> in Hong Kong has left the colony

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X136:2:Z>
But before he left he has some uhm parking shot about the
governor the Chinese and some pretty <unc> one-word </unc>
predictions about the future

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X137:2:Z>
He compare Hong Kong to a sandwich with the <unc> one-word
</unc> making the bread on one side

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X138:2:Z>
The unskilled labour making the bread on the other

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X139:2:Z>
And the ham which is the middle class is disappearing

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X140:2:Z>
How do you react to that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#141:2:A>
Well <,> I supposed I  ' m part of the ham

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#142:2:A>
And these lines are getting thinner

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#143:2:A>
But uh this is not to say these lines <,> cannot be replaced

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#144:2:A>
We may have <?> Yuan nan </?> ham from China before too long

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#145:2:A>
But I  ' m going to miss Derek

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#146:2:A>
He  ' s always provocative opinionated but very interesting

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X147:2:Z>
Okay let  ' s welcome our guest now Yeung Kai Yin

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X148:2:Z>
I just mention that our main topic is labour

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X149:2:Z>
But since you are the uh Secretary for Educational and Manpower

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X150:2:Z>
Maybe we can just squeeze in uh a couple of quick questions about
education

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X151:2:Z>
And first is that <,> no Chinese history after nineteen forty
nine is being taught in the schools

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X152:2:Z>
So what kind of preparation is that for young people facing
nineteen ninety seven </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#153:2:B>
I don't expect that question uhm <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#154:2:B>
But I think the curriculum development committee must be looking
into this uhm uh uhm in into this subject

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#155:2:B>
History is always difficult to to construct as <,> as a subject to
be taught in schools

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#156:2:B>
And anything as recent as forty years ago need a great deal of
care <,> care and handling

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#157:2:B>
It depends also on the <.> avail </.> a availability of textbooks
and constant teachers

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#158:2:B>
And if you go to Europe for example I mean in France <,> uhm <,>
some history texts stop <?> fu </?> stop short at the first empire

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#159:2:B>
Uh <,> but as I said earlier the curriculum development committee
is doing something about <{> <[> this </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X160:2:Z>
<[> Are </[> </{> you going to take personal interest in
<unc> two- words </unc>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X161:2:B>
No as far as history is concern but as far as uh <,> the uh
civic education curriculum <,> said that this is concern

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X162:2:B>
I know that the Education Department has done quite a bit <,> uh
in uhm <?> reorientating </?> uhm subject <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X163:2:B>
So it  ' s to bring the Hong Kong China relationship more into
focus

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X164:2:B>
I know they  ' ve done that <{> <[> into work that </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X165:2:Z>
<[> Into line or </[> </{> into focus

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X166:2:B>
Into no not into line

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X167:2:B>
We uhm <,> into focus

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X168:2:B>
Because we are concern with <,> in <?> passing </?> fact on if on
an unbiased bases

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X169:2:A>
One one of the things which you  ' ve uhm <,> changed is this
business of political education in schools

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X170:2:A>
Uh there  ' s an <?> audience </?> which said this is <,> uhm not
to be done

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X171:2:A>
And the <?> audience </?> they expect to the end nineteen fifty
two

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X172:2:A>
We  ' re going to change that now

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X173:2:A>
Uh is this part of the grand scheme to change things before
nineteen ninety seven

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X174:2:B>
No it isn't really that

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X175:2:B>
The education recent education amended bill that are introduced
to the Legislative Council seeks to remove from <,> the education <?>
audience </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X176:2:B>
All provisions prohibiting political activities and political
teaching in schools

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X177:2:B>
These provisions are <unc> one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X178:2:B>
They go back to the to the late forties nineteen fifties

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X179:2:B>
You know no no longer relevant to our circumstances

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X180:2:B>
We don't think that the teaching of politics in schools is is
necessarily a bad thing

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X181:2:B>
We welcome it so long as the teaching is unbiased <,> <{> <[> and
</[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X182:2:A>
<[> That </[> </{> is as difficult as teaching history if am
I say so

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X183:2:A>
Because I  ' m a student of politics <{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X184:2:A>
And it is not easy to <,> come up with a piece of writing which
is not bias in some way

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X185:2:A>
Uh either for or against <,> a capital society

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X186:2:A>
Either for or against socialism

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X187:2:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X188:2:B>
Well uh I think you will find that uh we will be introducing uh
into <,> the amending legislation of provision which <.> en </.> enables the
government to regulate uh uhm political teaching

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X189:2:B>
Uh and to as you said the guideline

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X190:2:B>
Now the principles under <,> the main principle underline these
guidelines is that the teaching <,> of the fact involved of a certain
political system whatever it maybe

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X191:2:B>
Uh present <,> a true story a factual account and shows both
sides of the picture

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X192:2:Z>
Oh oh we  ' ll watching for that

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X193:2:Z>
Let  ' s change to the labour scene

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X194:2:Z>
Uhm the unions in a labour of movement to against importing <,>
foreign workers

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X195:2:Z>
Business <?> interest </?> says they need <?> it </?> a hundred
and fifty <.> thou </.> a hundred and fifty thousand

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X196:2:Z>
One of the figures quoted uh foreign workers just to <?> code
</?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X197:2:Z>
Now you are <,> the government is a author

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X198:2:Z>
It  ' s import fourteen thousand seven hundred workers surely that  ' s
a compromise

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X199:2:Z>
It  ' s going to uh sacrifice no one </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#200:2:B>
Well it it  ' s <,> uh it  ' s not necessary a compromise

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#201:2:B>
We <,> look at actual <,> voluntarily reported vacancy

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#202:2:B>
These drop from something like seventy <?> odd </?> thousand last
year to about sixty four thousand a few months ago

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#203:2:B>
Now <,> within the <?> conscious </?> to set decision and set to
answer

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#204:2:B>
We  ' ve already got the skills <,> for importing technicians and
craftsmen

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#205:2:B>
We  ' ve taken the conscious decision to renew that quota at about
three thousand

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#206:2:B>
As it happens the ratio of vacancy reported vacancy at the level
of basic operatives

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#207:2:B>
It  ' s about three point four times that  ' s of reported vacancy is
that the level of technicians

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#208:2:B>
And if you multiply three thousand by three and three point four
times it happens to be about <,> ten thousand

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#209:2:A>
Well Legislative Councillor Tam Wing Chung who represents two
<?> of the </?> worker constituencies would say that that way of dealing with
the figures is uh full of hopes

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#210:2:A>
He said uhm for instance in in a piece <unc> one-word
</unc> academic journal he said one <,> the first quota was under
utilized last year <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#211:2:A>
Two you you shouldn't just multiply that by three point four

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#212:2:A>
Because number of workers uhm may not in fact equate so <?> needly
</?> into that particular pigeon hole

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#213:2:A>
And he said unemployment been rising

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#214:2:A>
It  ' s now closer to one point eight percent

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#215:2:A>
And he said unlike other societies Hong Kong cannot <,> live with
a three percent unemployment for long

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#216:2:A>
What do you say to that

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#217:2:B>
I say several things to

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#218:2:B>
First informal no scheme of this sort can ever claim a scientific
position

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#219:2:B>
But at least there is a fair amount of logic behind that

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#220:2:B>
I think we are reflecting <,> a quota attend our <unc>
one-word </unc> quota which <,> bears some resemblance to the level of
vacancy between basic operatives and technicians uh workers at a higher level
of skill

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#221:2:B>
Uh <,> it is a <?> cruel </?> estimate no one pretends that it is
either uh uh uh uhm absolutely right or precise

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#222:2:B>
But then <,> for scheme of the sort which <,> we are not aiming at
the precise estimate

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X223:2:Z>
You are called in a paper it say you didn't expect the scheme to
significantly drag down wages for local workers

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X224:2:Z>
But it isn't that the point that local workers don't want to see
any reduction of their wages

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X225:2:Z>
They want a chance to share Hong Kong prosperity </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#226:2:B>
No this is precisely the point

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#227:2:B>
It <,> past scheme in the past we have not

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#228:2:B>
We have fail to <,> give any guidance to employers about the level
of the going wage

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#229:2:B>
What we are now doing <,> is <,> to publish <,> uhm <,> the medium
wage call it average wages which the Census and Statistics Department <,> uh
surveys and publishes twice a year

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#230:2:B>
Now we  ' re saying to potential <.> em </.> uh employers

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#231:2:B>
If you are not going to offer wage at or above this level forget
it

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#232:2:B>
At least the average wage bears close resemblance towards what  ' s
going on in the market

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#233:2:B>
But if I would come back to T L on the point about unemployment

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#234:2:B>
Throughout the ninety eighties unemployment <,> has never been
much above <,> uhm three percent

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#235:2:B>
Only in two years I think nineteen eighty two nineteen eighty five
was at top at about five percent

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#236:2:B>
For Hong Kong for our stage of economic development

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#237:2:B>
I think we can classify falling <unc> one-word </unc> at
about three percent

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#238:2:A>
Well uhm I think Mr Tam  ' s point would be in a society which
does not have a lot of social security a lot of uhm <,> public welfare to
have that kind of unemployment would not be acceptable in the longer run

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#239:2:A>
You can have it for year maybe eighteen months

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#240:2:A>
But to have it sustain over a period of time

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#241:2:A>
Uhm would would be uh politically unacceptable

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#242:2:B>
I think we can uh be uh reasonably assure that if the economy
continuous to be as as as well manages it has been over the past forties
years

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#243:2:B>
As there  ' s no reason to believe why <?> would </?> for for as
long as we maintain the free market economy

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#244:2:B>
Then the past can speak for itself

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#245:2:B>
As I said over the nineteen eighties uh <,> unemployment has with
the exceptional one or two years not been <,> above three <{> <[> percentage
</[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#246:2:A>
<[> Oh but </[> </{> <?> do </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#247:2:A>
I I always work under the assumption that the economy is not
managed

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#248:2:A>
That you actually allow people to run their own show make their
money and invest their money or take their money out of Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#249:2:A>
That  ' s one of the you know great strength of the Hong Kong
economy that it is free and open ended

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#250:2:A>
Now uhm <,> however one of the problem of this kind of economy is
that when executives choose to leave multinational companies or local
companies

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#251:2:A>
Then you are you you are <,> uhm in a very tight spot

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#252:2:A>
Last year the estimate is that fifty five thousand people left
Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#253:2:A>
Mainly of these maybe up to quarter are university educated

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#254:2:A>
They have <,> ten fifteen years management experience behind them

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#255:2:A>
How do you propose to replace these

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#256:2:B>
We think that uhm there are two ways in which I think we can
replace the loss

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#257:2:B>
But let me first say that I don't expect the loss to be permanent
one

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#258:2:B>
I mean don't forget that the really serious <,> uhm <,> that that
the outflow of of of experienced people did really start early until about
nineteen eighty eight

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#259:2:B>
Given about three or four years <,> quite a few of these people
would want to would start <,> contemplating coming back to work in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#260:2:B>
If things continue uh uh to go well because they would have
qualified for their foreign passport

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#261:2:B>
They already were beginning to find more than a <?> tackle </?>
coming back <{> <[> <,> now </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X262:2:Z>
<[> Is that </[> </{> not one civil servant is come back though

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X263:2:B>
Well I mean if civil <.> ser </.> one civil <.> ser </.> if
civil servant has gone gone <,> aboard uhm <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X264:2:B>
They they would probably be <?> pensionless </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X265:2:B>
But that apart

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X266:2:B>
There are two ways as I said early of of of replacing the loss

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X267:2:B>
One is through <,> uh doubling of our <,> uh provision of first
year first degree places

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X268:2:B>
And the other of course is a programme by which we facilitate the
return of investors of past emigrants

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X269:2:B>
Uh <,> who who have prospect of coming back to <,> to work in
Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X270:2:B>
Uhm in combination these two programmes would reduce our
<unc> one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X271:2:B>
But even then I even there I  ' m not <unc> one-word </unc>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X272:2:Z>
Yeung Kai Yin thank you very much for coming in

<ICE-HK:S1B-049#X273:2:Z>
We will back in a moment with Lee Cheuk Yan chief executive of
the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Union </I>
