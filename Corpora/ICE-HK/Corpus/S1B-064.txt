Mr Loong can you look at page five to page eight of the
plaintiff  ' s bundle

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#2:1:A>
Before you signed this document on page six as you said in your
evidence in chief can you recall on how many occasions had you discussed
these contract with the plaintiff <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X3:1:Z>
About two times </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#4:1:A>
On those two occasions did you talk to the plaintiff  ' s
representative in person or over the phone <O> Cantonese translation </O> <&>
Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#10:1:A>
Would it be correct to say that what were discussed on those
two occasion were fully reflected in this documents now in front of you
namely from page five to page eight <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#11:1:A>
Your Honour perhaps I can rephrase that

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X12:1:Z>
Well you see <unc> three words </unc> therefore is
difficult to answer questions begin would it be correct so as to say </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#18:1:A>
I take your point Your Honour I can rephrase that

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X19:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#20:1:A>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X66:1:Z>
Well since it is not written in the contract that we have to pay
compensation if we dismiss their service that means we don't have to pay any
compensation </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#67:1:A>
On those two occasion did you expressly discuss these <.> i
</.> sorry your understanding with Mr Wong of the plaintiff

Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#71:1:A>
Did he ever discuss his understanding which he just mentioned

No it was not discussed at all </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#74:1:A>
Now uh Mr Wong moving to another topic the two hundred for
cleaning the bottom of the lift shaft can you recall when was that
arrangement made between management committee and the plaintiff

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X75:1:Z>
I believe it was some time after the signing of this contract </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#76:1:A>
Was it one or two months thereafter or one year thereafter or
what <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X77:1:Z>
That I don't remember </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#78:1:A>
The sum of two hundred was it to be payable every month
whether or not there was actual cleaning work done by the plaintiff

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X79:1:Z>
Yes </X> <O> Cantonese translation </O.  
  <&> Recording

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#80:1:A>
Has there been any agreement between the management committee
and the plaintiff <,> as to when the plaintiff would clean the bottom of the
lift shaft or it was entirely at discussion of the plaintiff

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X81:1:Z>
Uh sorry uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#82:1:A>

Well then <unc> a few words </unc> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#85:1:A>
Yes or whether it was at the discussion of the plaintiff <O>

  <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#86:1:A>
Go to the <{> <[> bottom </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X87:1:Z>

Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X88:1:Z>
Once a month </X>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X90:1:Z>
<[> You  ' ll </[> </{> need someone to raise the lift </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#91:1:A>
Yes it Mr Wong  ' s evidence earlier that

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X92:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#93:1:A>
Uh they required this system of the lift company and it was
when the lift company  ' s <?> they go and </?> inform them that there were
rattles at the bottom of the lift shaft that they will clean it up

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X94:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#95:1:A>
With assistance of the lift company

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X96:1:Z>
Well but </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#97:1:A>
But somehow this witness evidence is slightly different in the
way that he said earlier that the two hundred is payable whether or not such
cleaning work were in fact done

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X98:1:Z>
Well </X> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#99:1:A>
Yeah I I entirely take uh Your Honour  ' s point but I think I  ' ve
got what I want from the witness

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#100:1:A>
And this witness has just mentioned that the two hundred was ought
to be done or the cleaning work was to be done once a month

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X101:1:Z>
<unc> a few words </unc> you  ' ve done </X> <&> Recording
fast-forwards </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#102:1:A>
Hasn't add that rider into this last answer

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X103:1:Z>
That is part of his evidence

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X104:1:Z>
Thirty eight two hundred dollars payable whether or not to have
this cleaned </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#105:1:A>
Yes

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X106:1:Z>
Right

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X107:1:Z>
When it  ' s done if it is done at all being <{> <[> same </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#108:1:A>

Once a month when the <unc> two words </unc> </X> <&>
Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#110:1:A>
Anyway I  ' ve got the answer I want so I don't think I need to
pursue any further along this line

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#111:1:A>
Mr Wong talking about the eight hundred for cleaning the drainage
which you mentioned earlier this morning <O> Cantonese translation </O.  
 
<&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#112:1:B>
Which one

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#113:1:A>
The one with <indig> chat gei </indig> <&> name of a shop
</&> and the one in the courtyard which uh my learned friend had shown you
the document this morning <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#114:1:A>
Can you clarify by telling us whether that eight hundred was
por was for each drainage pipe <,> or for more than one drainage pipe <&>
Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X115:1:Z>
One pipe </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#116:1:A>
Can you tell us altogether how many pipes were there that
would require such cleaning or clearing up at Central Mansion <O> Cantonese
translation </O.  
  <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X117:1:Z>
To my knowledge at least three uh the three you can find in the
document </X> <&> A long pause </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#118:1:A>
Your Honour can I have one moment indulgence I just want to
check this uh

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#119:1:A>
Is it correct that the arrangement in relation to these three
drainage pipes were that every month you have to pay or the management
committee have to pay eight hundred for each pipe no matter whether any
cleaning work was done in relation to the pipes that have questions

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X120:1:Z>
So that meant you have to pay two thousand four hundred dollars
each month for clearing these three pipe so that <unc> two words
</unc> is that the case </X> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X121:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#122:1:A>
In relation to this arrangement who represent the plaintiff

I don't remember </X> <&> A long pause > </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#124:1:A>
The problem with these three pipes were you aware of them I
mean uh Lord these problems when you discussed the management contract with
the plaintiff back in June nineteen eighty nine

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X125:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#126:1:A>
So what  ' s <,> what was the reason that the cleaning of these
three pipes was not included in the management contract

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X127:1:Z>
Wasn't these three pipes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#128:1:A>
The cleaning of these three pipes

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X129:1:Z>
What was the reason </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#130:1:A>
Why

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X131:1:Z>
Cleaning </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#132:1:A>
Of these three pipes was not included in the management
contract <O> Cantonese translation </O> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X133:1:Z>
It was because at that time the plaintiff  ' s company had to hire
somebody to clean the pipe </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#134:1:A>
Uhm Mr Loong can you turn to page seven of the plaintiff  ' s

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X138:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#139:1:A>
Well that was included in the contract so why wasn't the
cleaning of the three pipes in question not included

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X140:1:Z>
Because </X> <O> Cantonese answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X141:1:Z>
It was because there was no fixed cost for the cleaning of a pipe
at that time </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#142:1:A>
Why was that not done on reimbursement basis then

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X143:1:Z>
That was the initial practice that is they issued us a bill of
eight hundred dollars and we paid them eight hundred dollars </X> <O>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#144:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#153:1:A>
The evidence so far is that that amount was being put forward
by the plaintiff it was then discussed by the <{> <[> management committee
</[>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X154:1:Z>
<[> But can </[> </{> you remember I <unc> a few words
</unc> again I want to be absolutely something clear about this </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#155:1:A>
Yes

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X156:1:Z>
As I understand first of all the plaintiff has decided that they
want to renovate </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#157:1:A>
Yes

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X158:1:Z>
All right so they asked the plaintiff to do some private work
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#159:1:A>
Yes

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X160:1:Z>
Nothing was said at that time about payment </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#161:1:A>
Yes

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X162:1:Z>
All right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#163:1:A>
It was then subsequently suggested by someone that what
happened if the work was not done

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X164:1:Z>
Well well

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X165:1:Z>
Then later on after work is done somebody said what happens if we
don't go ahead with the renovation </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#166:1:A>
Indeed

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X167:1:Z>
Which is perfectly understandable <unc> a few sentences
</unc> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#168:1:A>
Indeed

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X169:1:Z>
Right so if you you expect that <unc> a few words </unc>
the price later on </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#170:1:A>
Indeed

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X171:1:Z>
Okay so when that questions <unc> one-word </unc> raised
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#172:1:A>
Someone suggested five <{> <[> to six thousand </[>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X173:1:Z>
<[> But the </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X174:1:Z>
The plaintiff suggested five to six thousand dollars </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#175:1:A>
Yes

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X176:1:Z>
And have no agreement <unc> two words </unc> at that
dates </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#177:1:A>
Yes

<$Z2> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#178:1:Z>
<X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X179:1:Z>
When they decided to abandon the object the plaintiff put in the
bill the five thousand </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#180:1:A>
Yes

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X181:1:Z>
It is then approved by the committee </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#182:1:A>
Yes

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X183:1:Z>
That  ' s the bases <unc> two-words </unc> Mr Yuen </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#184:1:A>
Uh Your Honour that is the chronology of how the matters <{>
<[> happen </[>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X185:1:Z>
<[> But </[> </{> for the case I don't think there will be a
problem <unc> a few words </unc> unless by that you mean something
entirely different </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#186:1:A>
Your Honour what I wish to ascertain from the witness is the
reason why they agreed with the sum of five thousand

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X187:1:Z>
Does it matter or may be yes they did agree </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#188:1:A>
Well because that would be in relation to the claim of
quantum meruit

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X189:1:Z>
Wouldn't that be settled by the <unc> two-words </unc>
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#190:1:A>
If that bit of <{> <[> evidence </[>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X191:1:Z>
<[> That is a </[> </{> classic example of an agreement be
breached after what consideration being fixed after the </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#192:1:A>
Agreement is <{> <[> as they </[>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X193:1:Z>
<[> Benefit of doubt </[> </{> on the basis all alone <unc> a
few words </unc> to pay for what they have to say <unc> a few words
</unc> that is the quantum meriut

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X194:1:Z>
It  ' s not as if if this bill have been this evidence have been
well we never decide which figure were out even though they out in the bill
without the figure we never decide it never approve then you would have to go
go into the value of <unc> a few words </unc> if I accept what he
said </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#195:1:A>
Well yes if if Your Honour accept what he said

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X196:1:Z>
But you are not you seem to go behind that valuation </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#197:1:A>
Uh what the reason why I  ' m trying to do that is because at
this stage I cannot say for sure whether Your Honour would accept that that
was in fact agreed between the parties so if you at the end of the day Your
Honour does not make that ruling then it would be relevant to see whether
that five thousand is worth

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-064#X198:1:Z>
All right okay </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-064#199:1:A>
