WAR </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-009#3:1>
Standing in front of the mirror , she traces the contour of her
body with her eyes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#4:1>
She imagines her eyes as a pair of hands , just like in the drawing
lessons , detecting the slightest feature on an object  ' s surface .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#5:1>
They pierce the cold glass and land on the female body lying at the
bottom of the silver ocean .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#6:1>
They lightly tap her warm shoulders , wander along her distinct collar
bone , slide on her fair skin and finally rest on her breasts which sleep
deeply inside her pink lacy bra .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#7:1>
She frowns .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#8:1>
A warm stream rising from her stomach rushes to her throat .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#9:1>
She takes her eyes off the mirror and runs to the bathroom .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#10:1>
Kneeling by the toilet , she tries to eject the mess rebelling inside
her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#11:1>
But she can't throw it out .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#12:1>
There is something mysterious in her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#13:1>
It wraps her organs with a layer of membrane and urges her to vomit
this confusion out , until a pure vacuum is achieved inside her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#14:1>
She welcomes the day when she will be left with an empty , weightless
and peaceful body .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#15:1>
She stands up , goes to the basin and washes her face .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#16:1>
The moisture on her face is warmed by the fire bursting inside her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#17:1>
Back in her room , she puts on her brown pullover , blue jeans and
sports shoes and then starts packing her bag .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#18:1>
Her school uniforms , her sketch book , her acoustic guitar and her
diary will follow her to her aunt  ' s home .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#19:1>
She decides to leave the family photo albums , which she had shown
every classmate visiting her home , on the bookshelves .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#20:1>
As she is picking up the books scattered on the floor , she hears a
door slam , then women  ' s voices break in , followed by the dim murmuring of
the telly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#21:1>
She hurries and throws her clothes into her knapsack , for she knows
mother and sister are home .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#22:1>
&ldquo; Ah Yee , go wake up your sister for dinner &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#23:1>
Mother  ' s footsteps disappear into the kitchen .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#24:1>
She stands by the door of her room , waiting for the knock on this
piece of wood that separates her from them .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#25:1>
Her watch tells her that five minutes have passed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#26:1>
Only the murmuring of the telly pours into her ears .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#27:1>
She opens the door noiselessly , and carefully walks out of her room
, her knapsack at her back and her guitar wrapped in a black leather bag
hanging from her shoulder .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#28:1>
&ldquo; Ah Sze ... where you want to go ? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#29:1>
She refuses to turn her head to look at her mother who stands ten
steps behind her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#30:1>
Though protected by her woollen pullover , she can feel the invisible
arrows shoot from her mother  ' s eyes and crush her back .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#31:1>
They are made of ice , and melt right after pricking through her
veins .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#32:1>
Nobody will know what this middle-aged woman has done .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#33:1>
Crime will always hide in her daughter  ' s body .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#34:1>
&ldquo; None of your business ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#35:1>
&ldquo; None of my business ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#36:1>
You are my daughter , and I don't let you go out tonight ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#37:1>
&ldquo; Why do I have a mother like you ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#38:1>
I don't want you as my mother .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#39:1>
Why ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#40:1>
Why you lied in the court ? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#41:1>
She turns to her mother and dashes her knapsack on the floor .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#42:1>
Her guitar slowly slips down from her shoulder .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#43:1>
Tears flood her eyes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#44:1>
Maybe crying is good .... maybe her tears can cleanse the sin he left
in her body .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#45:1>
Caught in her mind are the choking smells from his chest , the heavy
breath he blew on her face , the moist lips that he pressed on her , the
mixture of anger and pain she experienced when he slapped her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#46:1>
She wants to uproot these images from her mind , throw them into the
toilet , and flush them out to the ocean .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#47:1>
&ldquo; He  ' s your father !

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#48:1>
A father never does that to her daughter ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#49:1>
&ldquo; He did it !

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#50:1>
You know he did it .... you know I didn't lie .... &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#51:1>
Sitting on the floor , she finds she can't have a clear image of this
woman who once held her in her arms day and night , kissed her on the
forehead every morning , and accompanied her to piano classes for two hours
every day after school .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#52:1>
Tears soaked her eyelashes , and under the light , their glitter
blurs her sight .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#53:1>
Is she or was she in a dream ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#54:1>
She closes her eyes , wipes away her tears with her hands , and finds
the woman still staring at her when she opens her eyes again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#55:1>
Nothing changes , except now her sight is no longer blurred by her
tears .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#56:1>
It is real .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#57:1>
She should now summon all the strength in her body and leave the
ruins as soon as possible .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#58:1>
The news broadcast flowing from the telly warns her of the time .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#59:1>
He will be home soon .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#60:1>
She feels her body withering &semi; she knows , she will lose every
bit of her courage to leave when he  ' s home .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#61:1>
&ldquo; You shouldn't hate your father .... &rdquo; </p> </I>

<I> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#62:2>
RUTH HUNG YU YUI </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#63:2>
AN ENDURING FEED </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-009#64:2>
The final bang at the door signals that the living room is at
last barren .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#65:2>
The sister peeps out from her room , makes sure the clock  ' s tic-tac
would be the only lively object that welcomes her , and dashes into the
kitchen .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#66:2>
Their tongue-twisting game has exhausted much of their energy , so
much so that sister is ignored .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#67:2>
She is hungry .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#68:2>
The family has planned to <indig> yum-cha </indig> , and father
leaves first for the Chinese restaurant .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#69:2>
He is anxious to get a round table .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#70:2>
He knows his daughter would like a small round one .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#71:2>
Only round tables allow everybody an equal sight of each other  ' s
face , she used to say .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#72:2>
But once the mother starts questioning her son for the reason he got
home at 2:00 a.m. last night , the sister expects a rotten grudge to be
renewed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#73:2>
And she knows too well they will not have a complete circle in one of
those round tables that afternoon .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#74:2>
She sits despairing , sticks her ears to the door and listens .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#75:2>
&ldquo; If it ever happens again , it will be the last time . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#76:2>
Having heard their argument from beginning to end , from the first
one to this last one , sister shivers at the thought. <it> She takes out the
last portion of the cheesecake from the refrigerator </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#77:2>
The slim hope for her brother and mother finding a compromise is
crushed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#78:2>
A week ago , she was naive enough to hope that communication was
still possible .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#79:2>
While the argument between son and mother whirls in sister  ' s mind ,
she slides the thin top layer out from the slice and swallows it voluptuously .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#80:2>
It is a marble cheesecake .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#81:2>
She takes in the whole indistinguishable mix of chocolate and cheese
in one bite .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#82:2>
It is a lot for the first bite , and too much for one bite .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#83:2>
She has the habit of eating a cheesecake horizontally .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#84:2>
It requires more time and patience to make sure that the cut slice is
even in thickness .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#85:2>
If mother and brother can each take a step back , include in their
vision each other  ' s perspective , the cake could be better served .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#86:2>
She swallows her second bite in tears .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#87:2>
Sister slowly pushes the fork into the fatty defeated pyramid .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#88:2>
She moves the fork through the unseen , then with a final struggle ,
breaks it free at the other end.

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#89:2>
<it> A clean cut </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#90:2>
No slicked out residue mark the cut line .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#91:2>
Well done .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#92:2>
Layer by layer , the condensed fat yields .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#93:2>
Each bite is the same bite , not too thick as to choke , nor too thin
as to dissatisfy .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#94:2>
Gradually comes the scene of greatest resistance , the hard biscuit
base .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#95:2>
Sister has cleared the top .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#96:2>
It is through a careful removal of the obstacles on top that one can
discover the wonder at the bottom .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#97:2>
The triangular platform lies nakedly glaring at her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#98:2>
Unlike the sweet , smooth , sensual creamy cheese top , the biscuit
refuses to give way , is too rough for the tongue .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#99:2>
But it is the basic strength that gives support at the core .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#100:2>
Sister does not chop the base into pieces .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#101:2>
She considers the action too violent .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#102:2>
Taking a deep breath , she puts the whole unbroken cheesecake base
into her mouth , softens it with her sweet saliva .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#103:2>
<it> It </it> melts in her mouth .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#104:2>
Having waited for his family for more than an hour , father calls
home .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#105:2>
&ldquo; It  ' s father .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#106:2>
He  ' ll ask for her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#107:2>
Am <it> I </it> to give <it> her </it> the phone ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#108:2>
Nonsense ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#109:2>
Exhaling a puff of smoke , the son lets the phone drop .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#110:2>
&ldquo; Who  ' s going to answer <it> his </it> telephone <it> for him
</it> ? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#111:2>
Paralyzed with indignation , mother stares at the ringing telephone .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#112:2>
The telephone keeps ringing at the top of its voice as if shrieking
for help .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#113:2>
&ldquo; They must be on the way . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#114:2>
Father finally hangs up with relief .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#115:2>
They are on <it> their </it> way finally .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#116:2>
Now neither of them shouts nor speaks .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#117:2>
Sister had just had her 13-years-old birthday last week .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#118:2>
Before blowing out the candles on the cheesecake , her two little
hands clenched , she had clung to the wish that peace would be at home .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#119:2>
A week has passed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#120:2>
The left-over piece is so much beyond memory that it gets far too
stale in a bottom corner of the refrigerator .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#121:2>
The sister , ignored this afternoon , feeds herself with the token
of her forgotten birthday wish .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#122:2>
&ldquo; Sorry , your daughter has been poisoned , &rdquo; the doctor
says .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#123:2>
&ldquo; She  ' s been eating more than she can bear . &rdquo; </p>
</I>

<I> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#124:3>
<bold> I FEEL HER LOVE </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-009#125:3>
The description and impression of mothers that I get from many
stories and from other families is that they are warm and tender , courteous
and amiable .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#126:3>
A mother will treat their children well and give all of her best to
her children .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#127:3>
I had been jealous of those children because they could get their
mother  ' s care every minute but my mother ...... </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-009#128:3>
She seemed to ignore my existence .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#129:3>
She would go out early to prepare for her lessons and assist her
students .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#130:3>
Normally , nighttime is the time for mother and son to reunite
happily , but every evening she was engrossed in her further studies .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#131:3>
Occasionally , she would raise her head from a hill of books and
watch me for a while , perhaps with a little regret .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#132:3>
I remember when I was a child , I always wanted to sit in front of
her so that she might watch me longer but this strategy never succeeded .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#133:3>
Our eye contact was always blocked by the books .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#134:3>
If my mother was not immersed in her books , then she would go out
and help her students and let me stay in the house alone .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#135:3>
I &lsquo; guarded &rsdquo; the house and just stared at the feeble
light of the lamps .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#136:3>
Fear was all that I felt and my pillowcase was always damp with
tears .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#137:3>
The only time I could feel my mother  ' s care was in the morning .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#138:3>
Every morning , when I went to school , she would say , &ldquo; Take
care ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#139:3>
Or when I was home , she would say , &ldquo; Oh , your are back .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#140:3>
Have you finished all your homework ? &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-009#141:3>
On the one hand , I could show off my independence to my
classmates .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#142:3>
But on the other hand , I always doubted whether my mother loved me ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#143:3>
Gradually , our relationship deteriorated further and further .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#144:3>
When I had problems , I rarely talked to her . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-009#145:3>
However , in one examination , my results were very bad .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#146:3>
When I returned to home , I never mentioned this .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#147:3>
Several days later , when I went home and opened the door as usual ,
the sight was unbelievable !

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#148:3>
My mother was not doing her work .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#149:3>
She was sitting on a chair and staring blankly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#150:3>
It seemed that she had a heavy heart .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#151:3>
She turned around and said , &ldquo; You come with me ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#152:3>
I didn't understand what would happen , so I entered her room slowly .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-009#153:3>
&ldquo; Did you have the examination recently ? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#154:3>
She gazed at me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#155:3>
I didn't reply .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#156:3>
Instead , I bit my lower lip and stood still . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-009#157:3>
&ldquo; Why are your results so poor ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#158:3>
How did you do the revision ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#159:3>
And what is more important is why didn't you tell me ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#160:3>
Give me the reason ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#161:3>
She scolded me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#162:3>
From the look in her eyes , I knew that she was very angry and
disappointed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#163:3>
I still kept my mouth shut and just listened . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-009#164:3>
My mother eventually stopped scolding me and said , &ldquo; If
you have any opinions , please tell me ! &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-009#165:3>
&ldquo; Nothing .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#166:3>
Anyway , you won't care .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#167:3>
Leave me alone . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#168:3>
I whispered to myself .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#169:3>
But as I said this I looked at my mother and saw that she was
looking at me sorrowfully , I bowed my head immediately to escape from this
view .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#170:3>
Everything became silent suddenly am I only heard a soft voice from
my mother .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#171:3>
&ldquo; You can go ...... &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-009#172:3>
I turned around and back to my room .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#173:3>
Near the door , I turned around to look at her and I could see that
she was looking at me with a her eyes full of tears . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-009#174:3>
That night I lay on my bed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#175:3>
I didn't know whether it was hot or I was ill .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#176:3>
I couldn't fall asleep anyway .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#177:3>
I coughed and coughed and tossed and turned .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#178:3>
Suddenly my door opened quietly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#179:3>
I closed my eyes immediately .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#180:3>
I heard a few steps .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#181:3>
It was my mother !

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#182:3>
After a while , I carefully opened one eye just a little .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#183:3>
I could see that she was squatting down and mending a sock .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#184:3>
A cool wind was blowing against my back .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#185:3>
My mother had bought a fan into my room .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#186:3>
She was looking at me and I was trying my best to pretend to be
sleeping .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#187:3>
I only heard her sigh and I was sure she knew that I was not asleep .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#188:3>
Indeed as expected , she spoke , &ldquo; The weather is quite hot .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#189:3>
My room has windows , so you use this &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#190:3>
She stopped for a while and spoke again , &ldquo; I know you hate me
, but I want you to know something .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#191:3>
Everyone must have their responsibility and work .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#192:3>
If you seeking a dream , it must be worthwhile , and you must pay
for this kind of dream .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#193:3>
I need your support ......

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#194:3>
Anyway , I am your mother and every mother loves her children .
&rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#195:3>
At that moment , I could hear that her voice was shuddering and
hoarse . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-009#196:3>
Since that day , every morning , from my mother  ' s
never-changing words &dash; take care &dash; I can feel her love .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#197:3>
Every lunch time , from the lunch box , I feel her love .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#198:3>
And every night , from her regretful eyes , I feel her love .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#199:3>
I understand her work .

<ICE-HK:W2F-009#200:3>
And now that I know her heart , I feel her love . </p> </I>
