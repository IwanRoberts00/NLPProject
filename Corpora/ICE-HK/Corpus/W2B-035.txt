<bold> HIGH RESOLUTION </bold> colour displays , Internet access ,
and multi-layered sound systems have not only made the mobile phone one of
the most desirable objects at the moment; they have given budding
entrepreneurs a chance to demonstrate their creative talents by incorporating
compatible technology . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#4:1>
&ldquo; Mobile phones have a lot more functions than just making
phone calls , &rdquo; said 24-year-old Kurt Chan Chun-fau , who runs a game
development company , Mobile Gamer . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#5:1>
&ldquo; Mobile phone game development is an industry for and by
young people .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#6:1>
In fact games are just a part of mobile phone entertainment , which
will be developed into a new media channel . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#7:1>
Mobile Gamer is just one company developing mobile phone games in Hong
Kong . Michael Kan Chi-kin , the executive director of Hong Kong Wireless
Technology Industry Association Ltd , says there are about 10 companies
involved in this industry .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#8:1>
And all have been formed by people in their 20s or early 30s . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#9:1>
&ldquo; This is a new industry , and Hong Kong is the third most
advanced place &obrack;  in developing mobile phone games &cbrack; after Japan and South
Korea , &rdquo; said Mr Kan . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#10:1>
&ldquo; With the launch of mobile phones supporting Java script ,
getting into this business .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#11:1>
The rapid increase in GPRS &obrack;  General Packet Radio Service]
subscribers by 87 percent in the last four months of 2002 shows that there  ' s
a chance for the game downloading business . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#12:1>
Mobile Gamer has created a game called Happy Together which
features likenesses of political figures such as Secretary for Security
Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee and Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#13:1>
Another game entitled Fighting College is a mobile version of Street
Fighter . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#14:1>
Mobile phone game company M Bounce , which has developed more
than 60 games with stunning graphics , has launched a game based on yoga .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#15:1>
The game calculates how many calories are burnt by taking on various
yoga positions .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#16:1>
And another game , Love Diver , has a driver swim to the seabed to
collect things his girlfriend wants while trying to avoid the sharks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#17:1>
These game developers are not just looking at local markets ,
their products have attracted attention from Thailand , the Philippines , the
mainland , Taiwan and Europe . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#18:1>
But games do not guarantee success .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#19:1>
According to Mr Kan , three more elements are needed to make the
industry prosperous . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#20:1>
&ldquo; The percentage of people using the new mobile phones is
still small , and the popularity of mobile phone games relies on the
penetration of these handsets , &rdquo; Mr Kan said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#21:1>
&ldquo; The subscription fee for GPRS has to be reduced further
in order to attract more mobile phone users to go online .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#22:1>
An increase in bandwidth would encourage the development of online
multi-player games . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#23:1>
Negotiating with the six mobile phone operators is not easy .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#24:1>
&ldquo; Unlike Japan , Hong Kong has no standardised profit-sharing
guidelines between operators and developer , and we hope that through
lobbying with the operators we can come up with a better scheme to free up
the negotiation process , &rdquo; said Mr Kan . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#25:1>
&ldquo; We are just a small company and lack experience , so
sometimes it  ' s hard to follow the bureaucratic procedures when dealing with
mobile phone operators , &rdquo; said Mr Chan . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#26:1>
The key to a winning game , says M Bounce  ' s Richard Cheung
Lap-tak is to combine creativity and originally with top graphics to deliver
a simple concept . </p>

<bold> Quality takes a knock in a liberalised telecom industry
</bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#28:2>
<bold> SIMON CHAN </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#29:2>
January 1 was a milestone in the history of the
telecommunications industry in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#30:2>
With the opening up of local fixed-line telecom network services ,
Hong Kong has liberalised the telecoms industry , from carriers to
valued-added service providers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#31:2>
The good news is that users can enjoy a wide range of services
from different operators at a competitive price .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#32:2>
But there has also been an unprecedented number of complaints .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#33:2>
What has gone wrong ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#34:2>
Is the quality of service really degraded ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#35:2>
What are the expectations for quality of service ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#36:2>
And what should we do to fix it ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#37:2>
A common myth is that competition will improve quality .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#38:2>
Not true .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#39:2>
The complaint statistics from the Office of the Telecommunications
Authority &obrack;  Ofta &cbrack; show an alarming trend . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#40:2>
The number of complaints is projected to rise 36 per cent from
1,733 in 2001 to 2,361 for last year .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#41:2>
In 1997 , there were 87 complaints .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#42:2>
Recent statistics from the Consumer Council revealed 4,684 cases in
2001 , up 51 per cent on 2000 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#43:2>
Of these complaints , Internet services have overtaken mobile-phone
services as the top troublemakers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#44:2>
It is also obvious that from a business consumer  ' s perspective ,
the quality of service criteria for different services are not transparent .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#45:2>
Some of these have been crafted in Service Level Agreements &obrack;  SLA &cbrack; ,
but the majority are never published . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#46:2>
Even in the recent network jam incident of September 11 last year
, the lack of transparency between fixed and mobile networks led a lot of
people to complain about the quality of our networks , even though the latter
are among the world  ' s best . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#47:2>
The fixed network is engineered to allow a maximum of one out of
100 calls to be blocked , and five out of 100 for the mobile network except
in emergency circumstances .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#48:2>
These network quality-of-service measurements should be published
regularly so that consumers have more information when choosing an operator .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#49:2>
Other performance measurements include time to install new
services; network reliability , repeated customer fault reports , the ability
to meet targeted repair times , complaint handling and billing .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#50:2>
These statistics may have been available to the individual operators
, but were never made public for the obvious reasons that they might hurt the
carriers ' image . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#51:2>
A classic example of poor customer service is the maze of machine
voices on customer hotlines when you try to contact a human for assistance .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#52:2>
One operator  ' s customer hotline is unmanned and , after forcing the
anxious customer to wait in vain for up to seven minutes , it drops the call .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#53:2>
Other hotlines will hide the operator behind several voice menus so
that only their staff can reach them .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#54:2>
How promptly complaints are dealt with is a good indicator of quality
of service and can be used to select a new service . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#55:2>
From a qualitative standpoint , customer-satisfaction surveys can
be conducted to either match those described previously or supplement other
aspects such as customer satisfaction .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#56:2>
In order to reap good quality in a fully liberalised market such as
Hong Kong's , we should not just set our sights on lowering prices , quality
must be made transparent .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#57:2>
The danger is that we let quality fall below a minimum acceptable
level , affecting our reputation as a telecommunications hub of Asia . </p>
<O> A table </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#58:2>
For example , Internet surfing response times to overseas Web
sites will degrade for second-tier ISPs as they drive down costs by adding
new users without increasing their bandwidth . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#59:2>
Data on quality will have to come from each operator .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#60:2>
Will they provide such sensitive data ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#61:2>
It will not be easy .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#62:2>
This is where the regulator can help . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#63:2>
In Britain , the telecom regulator Oftel published a set of
Comparable Performance Indicators &obrack;  at www.cpi.org.uk &cbrack; to help consumers
compare the quality of services from a range of British telecom companies .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#64:2>
In Hong Kong , Ofta is in the best position to publish similar
indicators , so that we can truly become a quality telecom hub of Asia .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#65:2>
Only then will consumers , operators and Hong Kong as a whole have
the chance to win . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#66:2>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#70:3>
Hong Kong is using innovation and technology as the instruments
and essential elements to enhance our creativity , add value to our
industries and strengthen our competitiveness . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#71:3>
Hong Kong  ' s industries and entrepreneurs , supported by the
government , are moving forward with efforts to improve efficiency , increase
productivity and utilise resources that have a capacity to create value .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#72:3>
Many of these resources have been put in place by the government
- the HK&dollar;5 billion Innovation and Technology Fund &obrack;  ITF &cbrack; set up in
1999; the HK&dollar;750 million Applied Research Fund to support local
technology ventures with commercial potential; the Hong Kong Science and
Technology Parks Corporation to provide one-stop infrastructure support to
technology-based companies and activities; and the Hong Kong Applied Science
and Technology Research Institute Company Limited , which conducts research
and development for transfer to industry for commercialisation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#73:3>
Since the launch of the ITF , there has been more corporate
participation in applied R&D .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#74:3>
In 1997 , corporate contributions to public-sector R&D were only
HK&dollar;1 to HK&dollar;25 from the government .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#75:3>
This has now become more encouraging: the ratio has increased to
HK&dollar;1 to HK&dollar;5.5 from the fund . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#76:3>
The Small Entrepreneur Research Assistance Programme under the
ITF has helped promote technological entrepreneurship by providing seed money
to start-ups with sound research ideas that can be turned into commercially
viable businesses . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#77:3>
The benefits of the ITF support have also become noticeable .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#78:3>
A range of new technologies has been developed from ITF-funded
projects , providing an innovative boost to the local industry . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#79:3>
In the information technology sector , the results of one project
have offered a solution to conducting electronic transactions over the
Internet .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#80:3>
This has since become a building block in public key infrastructure ,
ensuring the quality and legality of electronic transactions .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#81:3>
Another example is the development of a Web-based technology for the
news media , which has given a kickstart to the provision of electronic news
archiving and newspaper-cutting services . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#82:3>
In the electronics industry , several projects have led to the
development of technologies related to the packaging process .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#83:3>
These are essential to product miniaturisation and performance
improvement and enable local manufacturers to produce printed circuit boards
of high component densities . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#84:3>
And for the foundation industries , the development of a
free-form machining technology has helped local manufacturers to migrate from
the development of traditional optical products to high-end products . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#85:3>
These are just a handful of examples of how innovation and
technology are transforming Hong Kong  ' s industries to take advantage of the
information age .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#86:3>
And it is just the beginning . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#87:3>
A sound infrastructure is essential if innovation and technology
are to flourish .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#88:3>
The Innovation and Technology Commission &obrack;  ITC &cbrack; is helping to make
this possible by facilitating the provision of appropriate technological
infrastructure and promoting applied R&D and technology transfer and
application . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#89:3>
The Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation  ' s
incubation programme nurtures technology start-ups , while its Science Park ,
opened in June last year , provides premises and services for applied R&D
activities . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#90:3>
The Science Park is a cluster-style development with electronics
, information technology and telecommunications , biotechnology and precision
engineering as the four initial clusters .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#91:3>
It is creating a focal point and a conducive environment in which
technology-based firms can operate successfully .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#92:3>
The Science Park is beginning to provide a new impetus for Hong Kong  ' s
industrial development . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#93:3>
So far , some 25 companies have been approved for admission to
the park .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#94:3>
Together with a number of prospective tenants , more than 60 per cent
of the Phase 1 development has been earmarked for occupation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#95:3>
The publicly funded Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology
Research Institute &obrack;  Astri &cbrack; began operating in 2001 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#96:3>
Its task is to carry out research and development that can be
transferred to industry for commercialisation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#97:3>
The institute  ' s research programmes have initially focused on
photonics technologies , integrated circuit design , wireless communication ,
Internet software and biotechnology .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#98:3>
It is carrying out seven research projects in the areas of Internet
software , photonics and wireless technologies .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#99:3>
One project involves the development of technology to enable
interactive learning of spoken English on the Internet . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#100:3>
The Hong Kong Jockey Club Institute of Chinese Medicine ,
incorporated in May 2001 as a subsidiary company of Astri , is advancing the
vision of positioning Hong Kong as a world centre for the development of
health food and pharmaceuticals based on Chinese medicine .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#101:3>
And the Hong Kong Productivity Council plans to focus on integrated
support to innovative and growth-oriented Hong Kong firms across the value
chain , particularly in relation to manufacturing and related services .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#102:3>
Its main geographical focus will be Hong Kong and the Pearl River
Delta . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#103:3>
The ITC has also supported the establishment of the Hong Kong
Design Centre to provide a focal point for the promotion of design as a
value-added tool in raising design standards and the profile of Hong Kong as
an innovative and creative hub in the region .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#104:3>
This will assist with the integration of design into mainstream
business processes and help industry move up the value chain . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#105:3>
The government  ' s initiatives and programmes on promoting
innovation and technology are progressing well , with a wide acceptance of
the value of innovative and creative thinking in broadening Hong Kong  ' s
economic activities . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-035#106:3>
We will continue to support innovation and technology as an
economic driver , as well as promoting university-industry collaboration in
R&D and encouraging the private sector to invest and engage more in R&D
activities .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#107:3>
Further collaboration with the mainland will enable us to tap into
the scientific capabilities and technological opportunities in China .

<ICE-HK:W2B-035#108:3>
This will bring benefits to both Hong Kong and the mainland . </p>
