Fruit vendors have many colourful citrus fruits for the first
weeks of Lunar New Year - oranges , tangerines and kumquats chief among them .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#4:1>
I love tangerines because the loose skins are easy to peel and the
fruit is so fragrant . they make a wonderful and distinctively flavoured
fruit juice , which is a good alternative to orange juice .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#5:1>
You can also dry the skin of tangerines - just leave the peel at room
temperature until fully dried , then store in an airtight jar .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#6:1>
This is good for flavouring congees and stews . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#7:1>
Candied segments of tangerine make an easy petit four to serve
with coffee .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#8:1>
Peel the fruit , separate the segments and remove all the loose
threads .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#9:1>
Lay the fruit on a rack to dry for about 15 minutes .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#10:1>
Line baking sheets smoothly with aluminium foil and spray very
lightly with pan coating .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#11:1>
Lightly spray the tips of a pair of chopsticks with pan coating and
have these and the pans ready by the side of the stove . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#12:1>
Pour granulated sugar in a small , heavy saucepan and moisten the
sugar with a little water and a tea-spoon of strained fresh lemon juice .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#13:1>
Heat over a low flame , stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon
until the sugar is dissolved .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#14:1>
Using a wet pastry brush , remove all sugar crystals on the sides of
the pan - this prevents the caramel from crystallising .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#15:1>
Cook without stirring over medium heat until the caramel turns amber
, then remove from the heat .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#16:1>
The caramel will continue to darken . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#17:1>
Working quickly and carefully , dip the tangerine segments into
the caramel , remove and lay them on the baking sheet with the chopsticks &obrack; 
the oil will prevent the caramel sticking , but you  ' ll have to spray the
tips occasionally as you work &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#18:1>
Allow the segments to cool until the caramel hardens , then ideally
serve within two hours .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#19:1>
Do not refrigerate . </p> <O> A picture </O>

Cinnamon is one of favourite spices and I use it frequently in
desserts and pastries .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#23:2>
As stick or bark , cinnamon is used to flavour sauces or poaching
liquids .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#24:2>
The powdered form is used mostly in baked products .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#25:2>
It is also good in savoury dishes - it  ' s one of the spices in
Chinese five-spice powder and it  ' s also used in Indian and Middle Eastern
dishes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#26:2>
In desserts , cinnamon goes very well with apples and pears .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#27:2>
For a simple dissert , roll out a sheet of puff pastry &obrack;  all-buttery
pastry is the best &cbrack; until it  ' s very thin .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#28:2>
Chill for at least 30 minutes in the fridge , then cut in a large
circle using a sharp knife .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#29:2>
Pick the dough all over with a fork &obrack;  this helps it rise evenly &cbrack; then
layer with this slices peeled apples , starting from the outside and working
towards the centre .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#30:2>
Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar &obrack;  mix one cup of granulated sugar with
one tablespoon of ground cinnamon &cbrack; then bake in a pre-heated oven &obrack;  170
degrees Celsius &cbrack; until brown .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#31:2>
Serve with chilled cream whipped with sugar , ground cinnamon and
brandy or cognac .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#32:2>
Cinnamon toast is a simple and easy breakfast - toast the bread ,
then butter it well .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#33:2>
Sprinkle it liberally with cinnamon sugar then put under the grill
until it bubbles .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#34:2>
Let it cool slightly before eating .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#35:2>
Use cinnamon sugar the next time you make sweet yeast bread .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#36:2>
Roll the dough into a rectangle , brush with melted room temperature
butter , sprinkle with cinnamon sugar then roll up into a log , pinching the
dough tightly to seal the seam .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#37:2>
Cut into rounds , then bake in muffin pans .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#38:2>
After the rolls are baked , brush with melted butter while still hot
, then dredge in cinnamon sugar . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#39:2>
Cinnamon goes beautifully with chocolate - cinnamon milk
chocolate truffles are wonderful .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#40:2>
The next time you make chocolate chip cookie dough , try adding a
little ground cinnamon . </p>

<bold> Best Buys - Turnover to raisins </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#42:3>
By <bold> Susan Jung </bold> &obrack;  Email: susan.jung@scmp.com &cbrack; </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#43:3>
I used to dislike raisins because they reminded me of primary
school snacks - served in a little red box with a glass of apple juice .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#44:3>
Then I discovered rum raisin ice cream and rum raisin chocolate and
realised that rum &obrack;  or brandy &cbrack; makes raisins taste better . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#45:3>
When I worked in pastry kitchens , we rarely used plain raisins:
we would put them in airtight containers , poured in bottles of rum or brandy
and let the raisins soak for at least a week .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#46:3>
If you  ' re putting these alcohol-soaked raisins in cookies , dust
them lightly with flour first so they  ' ll mix into the dough better . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#47:3>
For rum raisin truffles , roughly chop about 100 grams of drained
, rum-soaked raisins .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#48:3>
Heat 200ml heavy whipping cream and when it simmers , pour over 200
grams chopped bittersweet chocolate .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#49:3>
Stir until smooth , then stir in the chopped raisins and a few
spoonfuls of the rum used to soak the raisins .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#50:3>
Pour into a shallow dish and leave in a cool place until firm .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#51:3>
You can put it in the fridge but check frequently to see that it
doesn't become too hard .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#52:3>
If it does , you  ' ll have to let it soften again .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#53:3>
It has to be at the right consistency &obrack;  firm but malleable &cbrack; - if it  ' s
too hard or soft , the truffles will be difficult to shape . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#54:3>
When it  ' s ready , use a teaspoon to scoop out small spoonfuls .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#55:3>
Use the palm of your hands to shape the scoops into balls .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#56:3>
Sift cocoa powder through a sieve and roll the truffles in it to coat
lightly . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#57:3>
For apple or raisin turnovers , peel apples , cut in half and
remove core .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#58:3>
Quarter .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#59:3>
Melt some unsalted butter in a <foreign> saute </foreign> pan , add
the apples , soft brown sugar to taste , a dusting of ground cinnamon and a
squeeze of fresh lemon juice .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#60:3>
When the apples start releasing their juices , turn up heat until the
apples start to caramelise .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#61:3>
Stir a little cornstarch into a few tablespoons of water , add to the
pan and cook until the juices thicken .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#62:3>
Set aside to cool . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#63:3>
Take a sheet of store-bought puff pastry &obrack;  they come in sheets
about 30cm by 30cm &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#64:3>
Cut each sheet into four squares .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#65:3>
Beat an egg with a tablespoon of water .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#66:3>
Lightly brush two adjoining sides of each square of pastry with the
beaten egg .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#67:3>
Put some of the apple filling on each square and fold the pastry over
to form a triangle .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#68:3>
Press the edges firmly to seal them .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#69:3>
Repeat with the other squares and filling .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#70:3>
Brush more of the beaten egg on the top of each triangle and sprinkle
with sugar , then use a sharp knife to poke several holes into the top of
each turnover &obrack;  to allow the steam to escape &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#71:3>
Bake in preheated 180-degrees-Celsius oven until firm and golden
brown .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#72:3>
Serve hot , with rum raisin or vanilla ice cream , if desired . </p>

When Harunobu Inukai is a guest chef , he insists on making
everything , unlike Vittorio Lucariello who takes a more laid-back approach .

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#77:4>
<bold> GUEST CHEF. </bold> The term is part of a foodie  ' s
vernacular , spoken with excitement when a particularly famous name is
visiting a local restaurant , and whose appearance may be booked out weeks &obrack; 
sometimes months &cbrack; in advance .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#78:4>
But even when the chefs are not especially well known , a stint can
help boost their reputation , taking them to the people , so to speak ,
rather than the other way around . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#79:4>
The appearance of a guest chef is usually preceded by weeks of
preparation , a flurry of e-mails and telephone calls between the chef and
the establishment hosting him , and a publicity campaign to announce the
visit .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#80:4>
It  ' s a costly project , at least for the host restaurant , which
pays for the plane fare , accommodation and the chef  ' s fees .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#81:4>
Some of the more famous chefs who have visited Hong Kong in recent
years are Justin Quek from Les Amis and Au Jardin in Singapore &obrack;  at
Brasserie on the Eighth at the Conrad &cbrack; and Michelin three-star chef , Paul
Bocuse , at the Regal Meridian &obrack;  now the Regal Kowloon &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#82:4>
If it  ' s so much work , why bother ?

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#83:4>
Aqua on Hollywood Road , which in October hosted Luke Mangan from
Salt in Sydney , is hosting Harunobu Inukai &obrack;  his guest appearance runs until
March 8; after that he  ' ll be at WasabiSabi in Times Square from March 17 to
April 4 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#84:4>
Aqua and WasabiSabi owner David Yeo says: &ldquo; On Monday &obrack;  the first
day of the promotion &cbrack; two diners had Haru-san  ' s <foreign> degustation
</foreign> menu and immediately booked a table for six on Saturday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#85:4>
&ldquo; It  ' s costly &obrack;  to do the promotion &cbrack; &scol; it doesn't make us any
money whatsoever .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#86:4>
At the best we break even .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#87:4>
But the whole point for Aqua is we wanted to do something different -
a smart cafe bistro with cutting-edge food .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#88:4>
This is a continuation of that journey .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#89:4>
We bring out people who match our style. &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#90:4>
Is it a lot of work ?

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#91:4>
&ldquo; It depends on the chef, &rdquo; Yeo says .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#92:4>
&ldquo; Luke &obrack;  Mangan &cbrack; is used to doing overseas promotions; he prepares
everything , flies it out and so very little prep work is involved &obrack;  when he
arrives &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#93:4>
Inukai doesn't normally do this so it  ' s more problematic , he
evolves his dishes using local produce , he  ' s learning all the time .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#94:4>
We have to fly him out earlier and work very closely with him .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#95:4>
Some of the things in his style of cooking that would wow an
Australian audience would seem jaded to us.''

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#96:4>
He cites one of the planned dishes , a taro-wrapped prawn in
<foreign> bouillabaise </foreign> , saying: &ldquo; The sauce is great , but it
looks like dim sum. &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#97:4>
Inukai  ' s guest stint is unusual in that it  ' s so long - many
chefs visit for a week or less .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#98:4>
Inukai came out to Hong Kong a week before his menu was available at
Aqua in order to work with Yeo on fine-tuning the dishes .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#99:4>
He can afford to stay in Hong Kong for seven weeks because he is
currently without a restaurant to call his own: despite his Restaurant VII in
Sydney being highly acclaimed &obrack;  it received a score of 18/20 from the Sydney
Morning Herald Good Food Guide and has served former US president Bill
Clinton among other A-listers &cbrack; , the establishment failed to pull in enough
customers and was closed in November by its Singaporean owner , EJ Ang . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#100:4>
This being only Inukai  ' s second guest appearance - he last year
participated in the World Gourmet Summit food festival in Singapore - he is
feeling the pressure .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#101:4>
&ldquo; I get in at 10am; I  ' m the first one in , &rdquo; he says .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#102:4>
&ldquo; I trust me; I teach &obrack;  the other chefs &cbrack; . . . but people come here
to eat my food , which means I must make and taste everything .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#103:4>
I make all the sauces myself , I know them , my memory is here &obrack;  he
points to his tongue). &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#104:4>
The chef , born in Nagano and trained in French cuisine with no
less a culinary icon than Joel Robuchon &obrack;  Inukai was chef de partie at
Robuchon  ' s Taillevent in Tokyo &cbrack; , describes his food as &ldquo; French technique
with Japanese influence .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#105:4>
I learned &obrack;  Japanese food &cbrack; from my mother and father and the French
technique from master chefs .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#106:4>
It  ' s an unusual combination . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#107:4>
Because he  ' s Japanese and working in Sydney , his name is often
mentioned alongside that of another hugely influential chef , Tetsuya Wakuda
, whom Inukai calls &ldquo; a world chef , one of the top 10 , I think &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#108:4>
&ldquo; His cooking , to me , is more Japanese - maybe 10-15 per cent
French , the rest is Japanese, &rdquo; he adds .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#109:4>
&ldquo; My food is almost 90 per cent French technique , the rest is
Japanese. &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#110:4>
Far from being the temperamental chef who believes his is the
only way &obrack;  although when I ask if he ever yells , he laughs and says
evasively , &ldquo; It  ' s my job' ' &cbrack; , Inukai is receptive to input from his host .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#111:4>
&ldquo; I changed my mind &obrack;  about what to cook &cbrack; after I came here .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#112:4>
I don't know Hong Kong tastes and I didn't know what the markets
would have .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#113:4>
I would make two or three sauces and David would decide on the
combination .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#114:4>
They  ' re still my recipes , so no worries. &rdquo; </p> <O> A Picture </O>

<p>

Vittorio Lucariello </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#116:4>
Nearby at Gaia , Vittorio Lucariello was making a three-day
guest appearance &obrack;  his promotion ended yesterday &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#117:4>
Born in Aversa near Napoli , Lucariello worked at the Michelin
three-star Don Alfonso and moved to Los Angeles as a consultant chef .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#118:4>
He is now chef of Il Cielo in Beverly Hills , where he cooks for the
rich and shameless . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#119:4>
He has an advantage over Inukai in that he  ' s been making guest
appearances for about six years .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#120:4>
To make it even easier , he doesn't have to teach chefs a unique
cuisine - Lucariello is an Italian making a guest appearance at an Italian
restaurant .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#121:4>
He makes it sound easy .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#122:4>
&ldquo; We  ' re professional .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#123:4>
I explain &obrack;  to the other cooks &cbrack; what I want but the technique is
already there . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#124:4>
&ldquo;  &obrack;  Gaia executive chef &cbrack; Paolo Monti and I planned the menu a
month before .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#125:4>
I sent him the information on the courses we  ' re going to do , what
he has to buy .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#126:4>
He can get pretty much everything; sometimes I ship stuff &obrack;  to a
restaurant &cbrack; , but this time it was fine. &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#127:4>
Lucariello is calm , despite having flown in only that morning -
just one day before his three-day promotion is to start .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#128:4>
&ldquo; We  ' ll start to do the prep tonight .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#129:4>
I  ' m very organised. &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#130:4>
So if he  ' s here , who  ' s watching the pots back at Il Cielo ?

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#131:4>
&ldquo; I left them a list of what to do, &rdquo; says Lucariello .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#132:4>
&ldquo; I  ' m not away for long; they  ' ll be okay .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#133:4>
I have a good <foreign> sous chef </foreign> , he  ' s been at the
restaurant longer than me. &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#134:4>
Just two days before we meet , the food world was shocked by the
death of Michelin three-star chef Bernard Loiseau .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#135:4>
The chef is believed to have committed suicide because the other
major restaurant guide , Gault-Millau , had downgraded him from a score of
19/20 to 17/20 .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#136:4>
Top chefs were commenting that the restaurant guides wielded too
much power and Bocuse was quoted as saying , &ldquo; I think Gault-Millau killed
him. &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#137:4>
&ldquo; That  ' s crazy! &rdquo; says Lucariello , who hadn't heard of
Loiseau  ' s death because he was on his way to Hong Kong when the news broke .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#138:4>
&ldquo; I wouldn't take it &obrack;  being downgraded &cbrack; personally because I
believe in what I do .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#139:4>
If someone judges me , it  ' s okay , I  ' ll take it. &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-011#140:4>
He extends this confidence to the unknown chefs he works with in
unfamiliar kitchens during his guest appearances .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#141:4>
&ldquo; It  ' s different but it  ' s all about the feeling , how you make
people feel .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#142:4>
It  ' s like an army , a symphony , we  ' re all working together .

<ICE-HK:W2D-011#143:4>
It doesn't matter if I don't know them , but we  ' re all
professionals and we have to do it together. &rdquo; </p>
