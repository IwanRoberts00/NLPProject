<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-098#49:1:A>
<[> No </[> </{> no no if I  ' m if I  ' m so I feel so I feel
actually I feel so regretted that I  ' d I I decided to do a French major
because all you do like I you take uh like all those three credits French
course but actually like the workload is about like a twelve like like a
twelve-credit course

<ICE-HK:S1A-098#50:1:A>
The workload is like that

<ICE-HK:S1A-098#51:1:A>
And they split it up because they want you to kind like get the
most

<ICE-HK:S1A-098#52:1:A>
But then I feel like I cos my French is so shit

<ICE-HK:S1A-098#53:1:A>
I feel

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-098#54:1:B>
No no no <O> Laughter </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-098#55:1:B>
It  ' s good <O> Laughter </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-098#56:1:A>
No

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-098#57:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-098#58:1:A>
No that  ' s not true anyway

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-098#59:1:B>
But <{> <[> at least </[> you can speak French fluently

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-098#60:1:A>
<[> Does it not </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-098#61:1:A>
No

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-098#62:1:B>
Yes you are

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-098#63:1:A>
No I can't speak French I can't say I speak French fluently
seriously

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-098#64:1:B>
Well but at least you can have some simple conversation where

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-098#65:1:A>
Yeah but uh but uhm <&> tut </&> but like the courses that I
took is something like uhm like doing French Literature and I like writing
and really big essay in the <.> re </.> <{> <[> really serious topics uh </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-098#66:1:B>
<[> I just thought that </[> </{> you you could benefit from
learning that

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-098#67:1:A>
I don't know if it is like because like in last semester I
ticked uh French Literature course and then and then and then like I do it so
hard like I don't even understand what that mean

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-098#68:1:B>
<{> <[> But then </[> because of you it  ' s like trapped in
between getting good grades or good courses

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-098#69:1:A>
<[> And </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-098#70:1:A>
I don't know I don't even <{> <[> realise </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-098#71:1:B>
<[> Realise </[> </{> what

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-098#72:1:A>
I don't know even if that that courses like good for me
because it  ' s too hard like too advanced for me

<ICE-HK:S1A-098#73:1:A>
I <,> I oh I like I I look up all those words in a dictionary you
know like but still I don't even get like seventy percent of what  ' s that
mean because that was like very like in sixteenth century

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-098#74:1:B>
You  ' ll have to <{> <[> discuss this </[> with your professor

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-098#75:1:A>
<[> So how hard </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-098#76:1:A>
Yeah and then he said in like two hours

<ICE-HK:S1A-098#77:1:A>
Actually I loved the professor a lot

<ICE-HK:S1A-098#78:1:A>
Because I feel sorry I <.> s </.> but then like I feel sorry though
because I might it  ' s it  ' s the problem like my standard is so bad

<ICE-HK:S1A-098#79:1:A>
It  ' s not <{> <[> his problem </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-098#80:1:B>
