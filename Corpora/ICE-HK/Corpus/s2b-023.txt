<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-023#1:1:A>
Just one year to go before Hong Kong reverts back to Chinese
rule <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#2:1:A>
It is only natural that feelings in the community are mixed <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#3:1:A>
On one hand most of us proud <,> that Hong Kong is reuniting <,>
with her natural parents

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#4:1:A>
On the other hand <,> it is understandable <,> that there is a
certain degree of apprehension about the future <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#5:1:A>
Most newspaper articles and TV programmes around the world have
tended to focus on the potential exposure and risk <,> surrounding this
historical event <,> rather than providing a balanced assessment of the
overall picture <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#6:1:A>
This has not only created a negative perception in the international
community but has also affected local confidence <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#7:1:A>
As a member of both the Hong Kong Legislative Council <,> and the
Preparatory Committee established by the Chinese State Council <,> I have had
the opportunity of working closely <,> with concerned parties both in Hong
Kong and in Beijing <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#8:1:A>
This has given me added insight <,> and confidence <,> that Hong
Kong will continue to thrive as a leading commercial and financial hub <,> in
the region well beyond nineteen ninety-seven <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#9:1:A>
<?> Whilst </?> China will obviously be involved <,> but Hong Kong  ' s
future is largely in our own hands <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#10:1:A>
Differences in values and attitudes are unavoidable <,> which is
why China has come up with a one-country-two-systems concept <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#11:1:A>
I realise there are divergent views in the community <,> but if we
can put all these differences <,> aside which are primarily political <,> and
work together on the pragmatic side of things in the near term <,> I  ' m sure
we can manage a smooth transition <,> which after all is what Hong Kong
people really want <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#12:1:A>
Confrontation and spreading negative messages <,> around the world
do not help <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#13:1:A>
They merely create confusion and slow down our economy <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#14:1:A>
Take the debate on the provisional legislature <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#15:1:A>
I  ' m not sure how productive it is to continue to argue about this
technicality <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#16:1:A>
When this idea was first tabled by the preliminary working
committee <,> and through the consultation period <,> no one came up with
alternative ideas <,> other than the fact that the current legislature should
serve the full term to nineteen ninety-nine <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#17:1:A>
As we all know <,> the reform package proposed by the Hong Kong
Government <,> did not have Chinese support and was unilaterally passed
through Legco by a narrow margin of one vote <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#18:1:A>
The community was polarised <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#19:1:A>
There was no consensus <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#20:1:A>
The Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen put it succinctly <,> <X>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#X21:1:A>
<quote> The rice is already cooked <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#X22:1:A>
Why belabour the point <,> </quote> </X>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#23:1:A>
We need to all work together in the interests of the Hong Kong
people <,> in maintaining our position as a leading business centre in the
midst of increased competition <,> in creating jobs <,> in helping the needy
<,> and continue to improve the standard of living <,> of the community <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#24:1:A>
There is a schedule on constitutional development in the Basic Law
<,> which is reasonable <,> and will be adhered to <,> albeit shifted by one
year <,> due to the impasse between China and Britain which resulted in the
need to create a provisional body for a year as a stopgap measure <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#25:1:A>
As a city within the sovereignty <,> we should focus on what we do
best <,> in building <?> up </?> on our economic success and not become too
political <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#26:1:A>
We should all have faith in the Basic Law and the
one-country-two-systems concept <,> and that the rule of law <,> and the
freedoms we enjoy will continue beyond nineteen ninety-seven <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#27:1:A>
China has repeatedly emphasised the importance of maintaining Hong
Kong  ' s stability and prosperity <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#28:1:A>
Let us not destroy what we have built over the years <,> ourselves
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#29:1:A>
Let us work together <,> for a better future for Hong Kong </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-023#30:2:A>
At an election campaign George Bush then an candidate running
for the presidency told the American people to watch his lips <,> so today I  ' d
like to tell people around the world <,> to watch signals from Hong Kong from
which they will know the shape of things to come in Asia <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#31:2:A>
These signals may come from little incidents <,> what I would call
the <?> pities </?> of every day <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#32:2:A>
Some of these stories make it to the front pages of newspapers and
others never even get a mention <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#33:2:A>
Whatever it is <,> these stories flash before your eyes in what is
generally described in local parlance as a five-minute fever <,> and then
quietly fade away and are conveniently forgotten <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#34:2:A>
In my rueful moment <,> I would say that this is the way of Hong
Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#35:2:A>
Hong Kong is like that <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#36:2:A>
Every story is a most extraordinary until the next most
extraordinary story comes <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#37:2:A>
Take for example a couple of months ago there was formed an
anti-provisional legislature alliance <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#38:2:A>
Members of this alliance collected signatures on street corners <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#39:2:A>
There were loudspeaker broadcasts

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#40:2:A>
There were slogans

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#41:2:A>
It was like Christmas <,> and people are milling around <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#42:2:A>
That was the story of the moment <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#43:2:A>
So what is this provisional legislature <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#44:2:A>
Why are people so against it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#45:2:A>
The current legislature of sixty members is wholly elected on the
basis of a system approved by the laws passed in Hong Kong in nineteen
ninety-four <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#46:2:A>
However <,> under the proposed provisional legislature <,> this
system will be dismantled and replaced by a system of selective appointments
under the aegis of a Preparatory Committee appointed by China and operating
under the vigilant eyes of China <,> which will be Hong Kong  ' s future
sovereign power <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#47:2:A>
But this eminent body of luminaries although of dubious
representative status is nowhere mentioned in either the Sino-British Joint
Declaration or in the Basic Law <,> applicable to Hong Kong when Hong Kong
goes back next year to China <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#48:2:A>
Many say that when one talks of <.> st </.> stability and
continuity of Hong Kong  ' s way of life <,> and the role of law <,> the
setting up of a provisional legislature simply does not make sense <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#49:2:A>
Some speculate that just as June the Fourth was a statement from
the Chinese Government to the students of Beijing <,> so the provisional
legislature would be a statement to the people of Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#50:2:A>
It will derail the legislative through train <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#51:2:A>
Symbolically or otherwise it will kiss the rule of law <,> and the
high degree of autonomy goodbye <,> and we are not even talking about
democracy a hated word to some ear <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#52:2:A>
On the other hand many China faithfuls or Chinese compatriots will
tell you with a straight face that the provisional legislature is an
inevitability <,> not because they want it but because China wants it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#53:2:A>
What China wants China gets <,> so why oppose something which is
inevitable anyway <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#54:2:A>
Being compatriots we should obey and not cause ripples <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#55:2:A>
Smooth transition is just that <,> not to cause trouble <,> or
oppose what China wants <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#56:2:A>
Many <?> are </?> already resigned to the fact that it is useless
to argue with our future master <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#57:2:A>
They say that the acceptable face of opposition is at best <,> a
form of quiet opposition <,> or to put it in another way gentle persuasion
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#58:2:A>
No confrontation please <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#59:2:A>
No open challenges please <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#60:2:A>
Why fight it

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#61:2:A>
Why not just lie down and enjoy it <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#62:2:A>
It  ' s now quite obvious that members of the alliance are mocked <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#63:2:A>
There  ' s also the good old Chinese way of killing the chicken to
warn the monkey <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#64:2:A>
For a start on July the first a group of magnificent <?> eight </?>
<,> the core members of this alliance including several leading legislators
<,> with their return permits in perfect order <,> boarded a plane for
Beijing with the hopeful aim of delivering to the Chinese leadership a
collection of signatures from those Hong Kong people who are similarly
opposed to the provisional legislature <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#65:2:A>
Lo and behold <,> in Beijing they were held at gunpoint <,> had
their travel documents confiscated <,> and were turned back on the same plane
to Hong Kong <,> on grounds of national security <,> and I do not believe for
one moment that they had even carried a toothpick between the eight of them
so to speak <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#66:2:A>
And the reason behind the strange eviction could be one of the
extraordinary stories one seldom hears this side of the Pearl River <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#67:2:A>
It  ' s also reported <,> that some hapless journalists who
accompanied them to cover the story were asked to sign confessions to admit
the errors of their ways <,> in having supported this so-called illegal body
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#68:2:A>
As for me <,> also a member of the alliance <,> I too have been
singled out for punishment <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#69:2:A>
I was refused entry to Beijing <,> by having my visa application
rejected <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#70:2:A>
Surprisingly and suddenly quite out of the blue <,> my speaking
engagement at the Asia Pacific Worldwide Web Conference on the subject of
collaboration via the virtual Orient Express was withdrawn <,> by the Qing
Hua University <,> one of the co-sponsors of the Beijing and Hong Kong
conference <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#71:2:A>
Well I don't know but I hope there might not be other forms of
intimidation persecution or incrimination <,> in the days to come from some
strange quarters <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#72:2:A>
And I certainly hope that the internet gets on the through train
after nineteen ninety-seven <,> even though I cannot <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#73:2:A>
But the world moves quietly on <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#74:2:A>
The internet conference in Beijing will no doubt carry on as
originally scheduled <,> with ne'er a ripple <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#75:2:A>
Nobody kicks up a fuss these days <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#76:2:A>
And this five-minute new story is overtaken by another headline
story <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#77:2:A>
This time it involves a legislator <,> of another kind <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#78:2:A>
The honourable Chim Pui Chung a successful businessman was hauled
up on charges of fraud and forgery and is now released on bail <,> of twenty
million dollars in cash <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#79:2:A>
Incidentally it  ' s reported that Mr Chim denounced his arrest as a
political persecution <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#80:2:A>
Whatever wrong the honourable Chim Pui Chung may or may not have
committed <,> he is certainly not guilty of having had anything to do with
the anti-provisional legislature alliance <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#81:2:A>
So there <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#82:2:A>
This is Hong Kong here and now <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#83:2:A>
Goodbye until the next extraordinary story </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-023#84:3:A>
Well it seems that this year the people of Hong Kong can
expect to receive <,> a big Christmas present earlier than usual <,> namely
on the twenty-first of December there will be a a present beautifully wrapped
and <,> presented to the people of Hong Kong <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#85:3:A>
What  ' s in the box <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#86:3:A>
Of course the provisional legislature <,> hand delivered by Santa
Lu Ping

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#87:3:A>
This provisional legislature we know will be elected <,> by four
hundred people <,> who form the selection committee <,> carefully selected by
Beijing <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#88:3:A>
On Friday week ago when the Chief Executive hopefuls were nominated
by the selection committee <,> the Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen <,>
hailed it as the dawn of genuine democracy in Hong Kong <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#89:3:A>
Yes <,,> genuine democracy indeed <,,> democracy with Chinese
characteristics <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#90:3:A>
Well let  ' s see how democratic the whole process was <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#91:3:A>
On the twenty-sixth of January this year <,> there was this famous
handshake <,> that we all witnessed on our television screens <,> when the
Chinese President Jiang Zemin <,> carefully selected <,> and of course the
members of the selection committee enthusiastically voted <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#92:3:A>
As for the provisional legislature <,> nobody can become a
candidate unless he or she has the support of ten members of the selection
committee <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#93:3:A>
Now we all know <,> how democratic these members of this selection
committee are <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#94:3:A>
Well you won't find ten of them who can with any stretch of the
imagination be described as democrats <,> so <,> is it easy to find a real
democrat to be nominated <,> not to say elected <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#95:3:A>
But even then <,> I think Mr Lu Ping will have a big headache <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#96:3:A>
Is he going to give all these four hundred people a completely free
hand <,,> or is he going to direct them how to vote <,> on the twenty-first
of December <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#97:3:A>
If you were to give all of them a completely free hand <,> then we
know there will be a lot of wheeling and dealing going on <,> which you  ' ll
always find in a small circle election of this kind <,,> when people would
not choose you on merit <,> but by the number of favours you are prepared to
grant them <,> you won't say may the best man or woman win <,> but rather may
the richest one win <,,> because we know that this election <,> is not going
to be subject to our electoral laws <,> so you can give as much money as you
like <,> to members of the selection committee <,> to vote for you <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#98:3:A>
The problem is <,> if the press should ever find out <,> that a
particular individual who has succeeded to become a member of the provisional
legislature <,> had actually bribed the people <,,> so that he or she won <,>
well there is no criminal sanctions at all <,> but will make the whole
provisional legislature <,> the laughing stock in the world <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#99:3:A>
Well <,> we the Democratic Party tried to introduce a bill <,> a
private member  ' s bill <,> to make sure that the election of the Chief
Executive <,> would be subject to our normal electoral laws <,> and we were
defeated <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#100:3:A>
We have not tried again in relation to the election <,> of the
provisional legislature <,> because we believe the provisional legislature is
unconstitutional and illegal anyway <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#101:3:A>
The other problem for Mr Lu Ping <,> is that although he and a lot
of Chinese leaders no doubt would like to see as many experienced legislators
win or former legislators win <,> their wishes may not come true <,,> because
<,> it merely depends on how many favours a particular candidate is prepared
to give <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#102:3:A>
And there  ' s no certainty either <,> because the beauty is it will
be by secret ballot <,,> so you would have plenty of promises <,> with or
without favours <,> but how many votes can you really count on <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#103:3:A>
Ask Simon Lee <,> who wanted very much to be nominated as a
candidate for the post of Chief Executive <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#104:3:A>
He said that no less than one hundred members of the selection
committee had promised to vote for him <,> and how many votes did he get <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#105:3:A>
Forty-three <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#106:3:A>
So Mr Lu Ping <,> cannot feel certain at all <,> that the people
he wanted <,> would necessarily be elected into office <,> if he were to give
<,> the four hundred people a completely free hand <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#107:3:A>
But supposing he were to opt for the other alternative <,> and
decides to direct them how to vote <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#108:3:A>
Well <,> how sure is he that all four hundred people <,> or most
of them would listen <,> to him <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#109:3:A>
Remember <,> the beauty is secret ballot <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#110:3:A>
But if it is ever found out in future <,> that Mr Lu Ping was
responsible for having this provisional legislature constituted because he
had interfered <,,> in the election process <,> then Beijing can no longer
put the blame on Hong Kong people <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#111:3:A>
That is Mr Lu Ping  ' s dilemma <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#112:3:A>
As for the likely candidates <,> we already know don't we <,> that
a number of former appointed legislators who never dared to face any election
either in ninety-one or ninety-five <,> are now rushing to register
themselves as candidates <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#113:3:A>
Then there are a rather large number of candidates who actually
stood in democratic elections in ninety-one and ninety-five but were beaten
<,> by candidates belonging to the democratic camp <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#114:3:A>
Well I recognise a number of faces <,,> of candidates who lost to
me <,> but if they were to win this time in this election <,> it would really
give me a lot of face wouldn't it <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#115:3:A>
But what platforms will these candidates have <,> during this
so-called election <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#116:3:A>
No doubt the Hong Kong people would like them to run on a platform
of defending the Hong Kong system <,> in the one-country-two-systems policy
but that would guarantee failure in the so-called election <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#117:3:A>
I wonder how many of these candidates know <,> what Beijing
expects them to do <,> namely <,> to rubber-stamp laws on subversion <,>
reinstate repressive colonial laws <,> and to repeal the most important parts
of the Bill of Rights ordinance <,> thereby rendering it meaningless <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#118:3:A>
Yes Beijing wants them to do the dirty work <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#119:3:A>
So <,> as of Christmas this year we are going to have one
territory <,> two legislatures <,> one defending our system <,> and the other
defending China  ' s system <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-023#120:3:A>
I wish Christmas would never come this year </I>
