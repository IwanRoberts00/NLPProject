<bold> &dollar;4b boost to ease traffic snarls </bold> </h> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#3:1>
A TOTAL of &dollar;4 billion has been earmarked to build the
country park section of the Route 3 Highway to alleviate the chronic stress
of New Territories West traffic . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#4:1>
In the interim , another &dollar;1 billion would be spent to
expand the uphill sections of the existing Tuen Mun Highway to allow greater
traffic flow . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#5:1>
Mr Macleod made clear yesterday that the Tsing Yi to Au Tau
section of Route 3 would be given first priority . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#6:1>
&ldquo; Increasing congestion for local traffic , together with
our increasing links with Guangdong  ' s economy , make a new road to the
border essential , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#7:1>
&ldquo; The first priority is Route 3 from Tsing Yi to Au Tau by
way of a new bridge at Ting Kau , and a tunnel under the country park .
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#8:1>
The Government hoped the project could be advanced in partnership
with the private sector . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#9:1>
A total of &dollar;4 billion , calculated at 1994 prices , has
been earmarked for the Government  ' s potential contribution on the project .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#10:1>
Mr Macleod said he would give the Legislative Council specific
proposals after the summer recess . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#11:1>
The Secretary for Transport , Mr Michael Leung Man-kin , said
earlier that the project would be started by 1995 and completed by 1998 at
the earliest . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#12:1>
Mr Macleod admitted in his Budget speech that traffic between
Tuen Mun and Kowloon had been under great pressure . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#13:1>
&ldquo; The transport problems in this part of the New
Territories are the result of geography and the huge expansion in our trade
with China , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#14:1>
For immediate remedy , &dollar;1 billion will be spent to widen
the uphill section of the Tuen Mun Highway in Sham Tseng , Siu Lam and Ting
Kau from the existing three lanes to four lanes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#15:1>
Mr Macleod  ' s new measures were welcomed by legislators and
District Board members . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#16:1>
Elected legislator of New Territories West , Mr Zachary Wong
Wai-yin , said : &ldquo; It is estimated the cost of the whole project needs
about &dollar;10 billion.

<ICE-HK:W2C-005#17:1>
But with the capital injection from the Government now , I think
private developers will be more eager to invest in the project . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#18:1>
District Board member Mr Yim Tin-sang said the administration
should ensure loaded trucks would be confined to the slow lane , and work on
the Route 3 country park section should begin no later than next year . </p>

<bold> Action pledged to tackle underspending problem </bold> </h>
<h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-005#20:2>
<bold> By LOUIS NG </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#21:2>
A PUBLIC Works Progress Committee will be set up to oversee the
implementation of the capital works plan as part of the Government  ' s effort
to address the serious underspending problem . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#22:2>
Mr Macleod also announced the establishment of a computerised
management system and more private sector participation to prevent delays .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#23:2>
Chaired by the Secretary for Works , Mr James Blake , the new
committee will be modelled along the lines of the Airport Development
Steering Committee , headed by the Chief Secretary , Sir David Ford , the
main objective of which is to monitor the progress of the airport core
projects . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#24:2>
Mr Blake  ' s role is similar to that of the former Director of
Public Works , a post now scrapped .

<ICE-HK:W2C-005#25:2>
The director had overall management of works departments and his key
task was to ensure that the billions of dollars earmarked for projects was
spent as scheduled . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#26:2>
&ldquo; I have asked the Secretary for Works to tackle these
problems as a matter of urgency , &rdquo; Mr Macleod said yesterday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#27:2>
A major cause of the current slippage in public works projects is
that the works departments report to different policy secretaries , including
Mr Blake , the Secretary for Transport , Mr Michael Leung Man-kin , and the
Secretary for Planning , Environment and Lands , Mr Tony Eason . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#28:2>
Mr Macleod said the overall management of public works should
become more unified , &ldquo; so as to remove any doubt about where overall
management responsibility lies &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#29:2>
While the Government considered appointing a new Director of
Public Works to co-ordinate the non-airport public works plan , the
Government decided that Mr Blake could fulfil the role . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#30:2>
A computerised information and management system will be
introduced to help Mr Blake to co-ordinate all works departments and branches .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#31:2>
&ldquo; It has become clear that we need new measures to ensure
that there is effective liaison between those who design projects , those who
undertake land acquisition for them , those who monitor their environmental
implications and those who implement the works , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#32:2>
Mr Macleod believed the new system would enable problems to be
identified and solved at an earlier stage . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#33:2>
Last year , Mr Macleod announced underspending of &dollar;5.6
billion on public works . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#34:2>
Yesterday , he announced another &dollar;5 billion worth of works
projects delayed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#35:2>
&ldquo; It has to be faced that the main underspending is the
result of slower progress with our capital works programmes than we had
planned , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#36:2>
&ldquo; Members will not find this acceptable .

<ICE-HK:W2C-005#37:2>
Neither do I , &rdquo; he added . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#38:2>
Mr Macleod said some remedial measures had also been taken .

<ICE-HK:W2C-005#39:2>
These included calling for tenders while tabling items to the Finance
Committee for funding , removing the bottle-neck of clearing year-end
payments , and the introduction of tighter monitoring procedures . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#40:2>
The administration will also consider contracting out more
Government projects to the private sector to maximise efficiency . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#41:2>
It would also approve more turnkey projects to quicken the pace
of construction , Mr Macleod said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#42:2>
Turnkey projects are those where contractors are responsible for
both the design and the construction of a project . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#43:2>
However , the secretary-general of the Hongkong Construction
Association , Mr Patrick Chan Wing-tung , said Mr Macleod  ' s prescription was
still too vague to convince him that the situation could really be improved .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#44:2>
&ldquo; We hope the new system can really improve efficiency .

<ICE-HK:W2C-005#45:2>
But it may turn out to be an extension of the existing red tape ,
&rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#46:2>
Mr Chan criticised the Government for failing to pinpoint exactly
the cause of the delays . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#47:2>
He urged it to conduct a survey to check all departments which
caused delay and reveal the results to the public . </p> </I>

<bold> By LOUIS NG </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#50:3>
INCREASED bureaucratic red tape had contributed to a sluggish
property market and encouraged developers to move to southern China instead ,
the Hongkong Institute of Architects claimed yesterday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#51:3>
President of the institute , Mr Dennis Lau Wing-kwong told the
Legco panel on lands and works yesterday that the lengthy procedure for
dealing with planning applications had created uncertainty . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#52:3>
The Government denied the process was protracted and said
consideration had to be given to the impact of applications on environment ,
transport and overall town planning . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#53:3>
According to the institute  ' s estimate , it took an average of 14
months for the approval of a master layout plan and another nine months for
the approval of landscape proposal . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#54:3>
Mr Lau said the period between the submission of planning
applications to the completion of a project had on average extended from
three and a half years to five years . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#55:3>
The institute proposed a statutory processing period should be
introduced for the approval of master layout plan and landscape proposal ,
which confined the maximum time to three months . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#56:3>
Legislator Mr Chim Pui-chung also asked the Government to extend
its performance pledges to the related departments to boost efficiency . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#57:3>
But Deputy Secretary for Planning , Environment and Lands Mr
Canice Mak Chun-fong said over 92 per cent of applications for approval of
master layout plan could be completed within two months . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#58:3>
He said only about three per cent of the total cases required
more than three months to processed . </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#61:4>
INDEPENDENT legislator Emily Lau Wai-hing is prepared to be
cold-shouldered by members of parliament when she visits London next week .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#62:4>
Miss Lau is part of a four-member delegation lobbying Britain to
drop a plan forcing holders of Hongkong British Dependent Territory Citizens
&obrack; BDTC &cbrack; passports to switch to British National Overseas
passports in phases before 1997 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#63:4>
The other members of the delegation are legislators Ronald
Arculli , Simon Ip Sik-on and James To Kun-sun . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#64:4>
Miss Lau admitted yesterday there may be apathy among British
politicians on the issue .

<ICE-HK:W2C-005#65:4>
&ldquo; What we fear is a lack of interest right across the House ,
&rdquo; she said , adding she would be surprised if she was warmly received .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#66:4>
&ldquo; Some of their people are very upset when you talk about
nationality .

<ICE-HK:W2C-005#67:4>
They will be strident . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#68:4>
Under the scheme , the Hongkong population will be divided into
10 groups with different deadlines to observe for changing passports , all
before June 30 , 1997 , when the BDTC passports become invalid . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#69:4>
Legislators said the scheme violated a British promise made in
the Sino-British Joint Declaration that Hongkong people could keep their BDTC
passports until June 30 , 1997 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#70:4>
The delegation will meet members of the House of Commons and the
House of Lords during their four-day visit . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#71:4>
Among the members they will meet are former prime minister Lady
Thatcher , former foreign secretary Lord Howe and the Minister with special
responsibility for Hongkong , Alastair Goodlad . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#72:4>
They will also lobby for full British passports to be given to
7,000 people in ethnic minorities in Hongkong , who fear they may become
stateless after 1997 . </p> </I>

<bold> China in plea over military land transfer </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-005#74:5>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#75:5>
CHINA yesterday called for the needs of the People  ' s Liberation
Army &obrack; PLA &cbrack; to be given priority in Sino-British discussions
about the transfer of military land in Hongkong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#76:5>
The call came after Sino-British Joint Liaison Group &obrack; JLG
&cbrack; defence experts failed to reach agreement after two days of meetings
on the issue . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#77:5>
China wants few of the 33 sites used by the British Garrison to
be re-developed before the handover . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#78:5>
A force of 10,000 troops &dash; which China is said to be
planning to deploy in the territory after 1997 &dash; would tie up almost all
the land and buildings used by the British Garrison . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#79:5>
Chinese team leader Luo Jiahuan said after the four-hour meeting
yesterday that priority should be given to the needs of the PLA , but denied
reports that Beijing wanted Britain to leave all existing sites to its troops .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#80:5>
He said the future economic development of Hongkong should also
be considered , but the military land transfer should not be dealt with on a
site-by-site basis . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#81:5>
&ldquo; We reject unilateral , piecemeal handling of any
particular site .

<ICE-HK:W2C-005#82:5>
We suggest , through rational and friendly discussion between China
and Britain , the problem of military land should be tackled as a whole ,
&rdquo; Mr Luo said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#83:5>
He declined to say whether he was referring to the recent removal
of the HMS Tamar naval base to Stonecutters Island . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#84:5>
China has criticised the move . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#85:5>
The Tamar site in Central was the most valuable of the military
sites , worth about &dollar;22 billion . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#86:5>
Mr Luo  ' s British counterpart , Alan Paul , described the
discussions as useful . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#87:5>
Yesterday  ' s meeting was the second day of talks between the
defence experts .

<ICE-HK:W2C-005#88:5>
Both sides said discussions would be continued . </p> </I>

<bold> HK on line for new bullet train link with Guangzhou </bold>
</h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-005#90:6>
<bold> By LOUIS NG </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#91:6>
HONGKONG could have its own &ldquo; bullet train &rdquo; if the
territory adopts an ambitious rail development strategy for the 21st century .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#92:6>
A new government consultancy report recommends the building of a
High Speed Rail &obrack; HSR &cbrack; link , similar to Japan  ' s bullet train
, between Hongkong and Guangzhou . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#93:6>
Capable of up to 300 kilometres an hour , such trains would cut
the current three-hour journey to just 30 minutes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#94:6>
The report says an HSR link will be needed to accommodate the
increasing demands of cross-border traffic by the first decade of the next
century . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#95:6>
&ldquo; While there is no immediate need for Hongkong , strategic
rail planning should consider long-term possibilities and any implications by
way of alignment reserves and terminal facilities , &rdquo; the report said .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#96:6>
&ldquo; The planning and development of HSR is a complex and
demanding process .

<ICE-HK:W2C-005#97:6>
However , the future development of the Pearl River Delta region and
economic links between the cities of south China require that such long-term
possibilities are considered in the preparing of railway plans for Hongkong .
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#98:6>
An entire new rail corridor would be needed if totally
un-interrupted services were to be provided for the high speed link .

<ICE-HK:W2C-005#99:6>
The report says it could operate a proposed &ldquo; Western Corridor
&rdquo; from Shamshuipo to the border or use the existing Kowloon-Canton
Railway link . But this would be at the expenses of speed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#100:6>
At present , rail services account for 80 per cent of
cross-border passenger volume , with the report estimating the existing rail
market to Guangzhou at 7.5 million passengers a year.

<ICE-HK:W2C-005#101:6>
But that figure will rise to nearly 20 million by 2011 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#102:6>
The report also estimates that the whole Pearl River Delta could
reach a population of more than 40 million by the turn of the century ,
compared with its existing 26.5 million people . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-005#103:6>
&ldquo; The necessary transport links , particularly rail ,
could unlock a new economic take-off for inland China . &rdquo; </p> </I>
