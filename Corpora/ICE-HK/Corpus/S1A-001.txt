<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-001#239:1:A>
Uhm <,> just because China want to took <,> wants to take

<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X241:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#245:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X246:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X247:1:Z>
What is <,> what do you think that <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X248:1:Z>
What do you think that most Hong Kong people think about <,> the
Taiwan <,> incident right now

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X249:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#256:1:A>
Yes

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-001#257:1:B>
Because <,> it  ' s because uhm the <,> United States
interfered in the event <{1> <[1> and </[1> I guess <,,> so most Hong Kong
people <,> has the feeling against the US because <{2> <[2> why <,> why </[2>
do they <?> bother her <?>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X258:1:Z>

Exactly yeah I

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X261:1:Z>

a lot of people in the US think the same thing <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X262:1:Z>
The moment that you send off a huge aircraft carrier <{2> <[2>
<,> </[2> that costs a huge amount of money and then everyone says how long
is that aircraft carrier going to stay there <,> with all those ships because
they are floating around but <,> they cost thousands <?> if </?> millions of
dollars <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> every every week probably more than a million
dollars a week </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-001#263:1:B>

Oh <{> <[> well </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-001#450:1:A>
<[> I think </[> </{> <,> she is a kind of traditional <,>
kind of Chinese <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> to believe in something like uhm it was I
I don't know how to say just I think <,> she <,> she thinks uhm <,> I I I
cannot say <,> maybe uhm <,> I  ' m <,> wholly responsible for <{2> <[2> <,>
</[2> for the <,> you know for the breakdown <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> the fall
down of the family

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X451:1:Z>
<[1> Oh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X452:1:Z>
<[2> Oh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X453:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X454:1:Z>
Wow oh uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X455:1:Z>
I don't know

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X456:1:Z>
I mean that  ' s <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X457:1:Z>
It  ' s very hard to <,> I mean I must say that it  ' s rather hard
to

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X458:1:Z>
You could also come up with a different story just as easily <{1>
<[1> <,> </[1> you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X459:1:Z>
You could say that <,> you know good things and bad things come
together <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and maybe there was a bad thing and that and the
good thing

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X460:1:Z>
You are the good thing </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-001#461:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#462:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#463:1:A>
Yeah so <O>

$Z-laughs </O> so I I I  ' m quite <,> I don't know how to say but I think <,>
my my father has <,> experienced a lot because <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> before <,>
he has uhm he has his own company <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> uhm <,> uhm my my
father and mother lives in a quite large house but but finally comes out <,>
with everything has been lost and <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> maybe <,> maybe from a
a a quite upper class and then <,> falls down into the middle class so I I
think <,> they they have <,> a lot of pressure but <{3> <[3> actually </[3>
right now my <,> father <,> doesn't really blame me for anything <{4> <[4>
<,> </[4> but he but actually he quite <,> cares about <,> my <,> future

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X464:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X503:1:Z>
Uhm even though <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X504:1:Z>
Does a teacher make a lot of money here or </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-001#505:1:A>
No <,> not <{1> <[1> not </[1> because of the money but <{2>
<[2> <,> </[2> but <,> but I I think I want to be a teacher but I <,> I know
I <,> I wouldn't be a good teacher <,> but

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X506:1:Z>
<[1> No </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X507:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X508:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X509:1:Z>
Why do you say that <O> laughs </O>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X510:1:Z>
Surely it  ' s not true </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-001#511:1:A>
Yes because <{1> <[1> I  ' m </[1> not <,> I am not smart in my

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X512:1:Z>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X514:1:Z>
No no <O> laughs </O> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-001#515:1:A>

so </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-001#X516:1:Z>
