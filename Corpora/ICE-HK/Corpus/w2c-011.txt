<bold> By FIONA CHAN </bold> </h 
 

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#3:1>
A POLL of university doctors will be made in the next two weeks to
gauge their support for a new remuneration package for which their
association is fighting . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#4:1>
The results will be given to the Government to allow it to assess
the extra costs , which will be a major factor in the acceptance of the
proposed scheme . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#5:1>
The cost of the new offer , assuming all doctors accept it , could
be as high as &dollar;100 million a year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#6:1>
The move was decided after an emergency meeting yesterday between
five leading members of the University Medical Doctors  '  Association and the
Secretary for Education and Manpower , Mr John Chan Cho-chak . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#7:1>
The number of potential participants will be discussed by the two
parties at a meeting on July 22 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#8:1>
It is understood the 209 university doctors will be asked whether
they prefer a package similar to that offered by the Hospital Authority to
its doctors . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#9:1>
The association has complained about a huge discrepancy in cash
payments offered by the universities and the authority . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#10:1>
Doctors claim that many benefits are given as cash allowances
under the authority , and the difference makes it difficult for the
universities to recruit staff . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#11:1>
The association has been battling for parity for two years .

<ICE-HK:W2C-011#12:1>
Earlier this week it issued an ultimatum that doctors would resort to
industrial action on August 1 unless the Government gave an &ldquo; immediate
answer &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#13:1>
It is expected that any new package would only be offered next
financial year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#14:1>
After yesterday  ' s meeting , the five association members
promised to provide the branch with &ldquo; further information required
&rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#15:1>
An association statement said : &ldquo; Both sides are committed
to finding a solution to the issue as quickly as possible in order to avoid
any confrontation in the short term , and serious consequences to clinical
services , medical education and research in the long term . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#16:1>
The Education and Manpower Branch declined to comment on the
meeting . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#17:1>
Meanwhile , the dean of the Hongkong University  ' s medical
faculty , Professor Ma Ho-kei , yesterday confirmed that the intake of
medical students had to be cut by 10 in the coming school year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#18:1>
The reduction means the university will have the same number of
students as the Chinese University for the first time in 10 years . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#19:1>
Both universities will take 160 medical students .

<ICE-HK:W2C-011#20:1>
The cut follows the Government  ' s decision to withdraw &dollar;300
million from the &dollar;18.2 billion previously allocated to the University
and Polytechnic Grants Committee for 1992-1995 . </p> </I>

<bold> Doctor fees in hospitals rise 20pc </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-011#22:2>
<bold> By FIONA CHAN </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#23:2>
PRIVATE doctors  '  charges in hospitals have leaped by 20 per cent
this year but clinical fees have remained the same , a Hongkong Medical
Association &obrack; HKMA &cbrack; survey has revealed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#24:2>
The 4,000-strong HKMA claimed that a high inflation rate , which
pushed up medical costs , and inaccurate charge submissions by doctors last
year had led to the sharp rise of hospital services charges being reflected
this year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#25:2>
HKMA chairman Dr Leong Che-hung defended the high increases and
said they had nothing to do with unethical charging , as claimed by medical
insurers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#26:2>
The association said this year  ' s survey reflected actual fees
charged by doctors on patients in single rooms at private hospitals , which
could have pushed up average fees . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#27:2>
Another factor for the sudden sharp rise , the HKMA claimed , was
that last year  ' s estimated fees were exceptionally low because many doctors
gave only rough estimates , therefore , a final adjustment this time made
this year  ' s figures look high . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#28:2>
The association also used the survey to defend its opposition to
repeated calls from medical insurers for the drafting of a fees schedule .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#29:2>
Dr Leong said their own survey was more meaningful for doctors
and the public . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#30:2>
&ldquo; If the range of charges &obrack; in the fees schedule
&cbrack; is too broad , it will be meaningless .

<ICE-HK:W2C-011#31:2>
If it is too narrow , it will neglect the complexity of individual
services and doctors  '  experience, &rdquo; he added . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#32:2>
However , the new chairman of the Medical Insurance Association ,
Mr Nicholas Donne , insisted on its demand for an &ldquo; advisory fees
schedule &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#33:2>
Mr Donne said insurers would continue their discussions with the
HKMA on the fees schedule after the release of its own survey on surgical
fees before the end of September . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#34:2>
He said it was not fair for them to comment on the HKMA  ' s survey
results but he welcomed its move as it was in the public interest . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#35:2>
Questionnaires were distributed to 1,946 HKMA members in May and
648 people responded .

<ICE-HK:W2C-011#36:2>
The survey lists a range of doctors fees , but only the majority 80
per cent prices are presented to order to give a more accurate picture .

<ICE-HK:W2C-011#37:2>
The remaining 10 per cent at the two extreme ends of the price
spectrum were ignored . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#38:2>
Results showed that general practitioners charged patients in
hospitals from &dollar;400 to &dollar;1,500 for daily attendance while
bedside procedure cost between &dollar;500 and &dollar;3,000 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#39:2>
Specialists also had wide ranging charges on patients in
hospitals .

<ICE-HK:W2C-011#40:2>
Specialists charged patients on daily attendance from &dollar;600 to
&dollar;1,500 , bedside procedures from &dollar;500 to &dollar;4,000 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#41:2>
Ultra-major operations such as heart and brain opening operations
cost &dollar;20,000 to &dollar;120,000 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#42:2>
Patients having major operations such as surgery on the stomach
were charged &dollar;10,000 to &dollar;50,000 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#43:2>
Intermediate operations like appendix removal cost from
&dollar;6,000 to &dollar;25,000 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#44:2>
HKMA vice-chairman Dr Lee Kin-hung , said keen competition from
an increasing number of private general practitioners contributed to the
stable clinical charges . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#45:2>
General practitioners  '  clinical services on regular consultation
&dash; including two days  '  medication &dash; ranged from &dollar;80 to
&dollar;300 . </p> </I>

MEDICAL research and training would suffer badly unless pay for
university doctors was increased , four top academics claimed yesterday .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#49:3>
The four professors from the University of Hongkong , including
Senior Pro-Vice Chancellor , Professor Rosie Young Tse-tse , warned the
Government unless their colleagues  '  pay was given parity with staff at the
Hospital Authority &obrack; HA &cbrack; the standard of local health care
would suffer . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#50:3>
Medical achievements pioneered by university doctors including
organ transplants and breakthroughs in genetic research showed the importance
of their work , the professors claimed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#51:3>
Representatives of the University Medical Doctors  '  Association
will have their second meeting with the Secretary for Education and Manpower
, Mr John Chan Cho-chak , next week before a deadline for industrial action
scheduled for August 1 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#52:3>
They are angry at the difference in the remuneration package
offered by the university and HA . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#53:3>
The university doctors say an independent study shows the
difference in payment between the comparable posts of a senior medical
officer , and a top medical lecturer was &dollar;600,000 per year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#54:3>
Professor Young said the &ldquo; pillar &rdquo; of the teaching
staff would resign if the deadlock could not be resolved . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#55:3>
&ldquo; I don't think there will be mass resignation .

<ICE-HK:W2C-011#56:3>
But those of good quality and those we most need will resign, &rdquo;
she said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#57:3>
And it would lower the standard of medical training in Hongkong ,
she added . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#58:3>
Head of Department of Surgery , Professor John Wong said the
vacancies would be filled by expatriates who were of the same quality but not
commitment .

<ICE-HK:W2C-011#59:3>
The 10 latest applications for a lecturer post were all from overseas .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#60:3>
Professor Wong warned : &ldquo; A large number of people are
resigning .

<ICE-HK:W2C-011#61:3>
They are people who will eventually take our places .

<ICE-HK:W2C-011#62:3>
We will lose people in the middle management . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#63:3>
Head of the Department of Medicine at the University of Hongkong
, Professor Chan Tai-kwong , said the difference in the pay packages had hit
the medics  '  morale and he expected university doctors would resign if they
did not get a better offer . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#64:3>
He did not expect doctors to go on strike as it would harm the
patients but they would simply look for other jobs . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#65:3>
&ldquo; We are not only talking about 200 doctors .

<ICE-HK:W2C-011#66:3>
We are talking about the best of the profession in public hospitals,
&rdquo; Professor Chan said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#67:3>
Yesterday , he also revealed the major achievements of the
department in genetics studies , bone marrow transplant and cardiology .

<ICE-HK:W2C-011#68:3>
He said the University and Polytechnic Grant Committee would continue
its exercise on surveying the working hours of university doctors in October .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#69:3>
Head of the department of paediatrics , Professor Yeung Chap-yung
, said four vacancies in the department had yet to be filled and five very
good applicants in latest recruitment exercises went to HA because of better
pay . </p> </I>

<bold> Cornea donations curbed by confusion </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-011#71:4>
<bold> By FIONA CHAN </bold> </h 
 

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#72:4>
CONFUSION over the Human Organ Transplant Bill has led to a
greater reluctance to donate corneas , according to the head of the eye
tissue laboratory . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#73:4>
The medical director of the Hongkong Eye Bank and Research
Foundation , Professor Patrick Ho , said the laboratory had collected just 26
corneas since it was established in November . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#74:4>
He said the unsatisfactory response was caused by the common
misunderstanding that eye tissue could only be donated to a patient by a
relative . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#75:4>
He attributed this to vague reports in the media that failed to
specify the difference between live donations and organs taken after death .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#76:4>
The foundation was established 30 years ago and the aim of the
only local laboratory at the Chinese University is to collect top-quality eye
tissue for redistribution . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#77:4>
Cornea problems can be the result of old age , injury ,
infections , inflammation , illnesses , scarring during surgery or
complications from wearing contact lenses . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#78:4>
Professor Ho , who is also convenor of the laboratory
subcommittee , said there were about 1,000 patients on the waiting list .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#79:4>
The Human Organ Transplant Bill , which has still to be approved
by the Legislative Council , is aimed at forbidding trade in organs and
controlling the use of organs from live donors . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#80:4>
The bill states that the donor should be the spouse or
genetically related to the recipient . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#81:4>
Professor Ho said the bill specified that living donors should be
blood relatives , but cornea patients only received transplants from dead
donors . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#82:4>
&ldquo; I have come across many cases of requests being turned
down because patients  '  families were worried about possible breaches of the
future legislation, &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#83:4>
Professor Ho said he had addressed a letter to the Secretary for
Health and Welfare , Mrs Elizabeth Wong Chien Chi-lien , recommending two
separate drafts for live donations and cadaveric donations . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#84:4>
He admitted the &dollar;600,000 a year laboratory was going to
waste and could do more . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#85:4>
There were 28,075 deaths in the territory last year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#86:4>
The principal assistant secretary for health and welfare , Mr
Derek Gould , said the legislation was complicated and the branch had made
every effort to simplify it . </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#89:5>
THE Government  ' s move to set up a &dollar;350 million special
fund for HIV-positive haemophiliacs was welcomed yesterday but some victims
were worried that they would get only a small amount of cash . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#90:5>
Mr Macleod announced in the Budget that the fund was for about 61
haemophiliacs who were infected by transfusions of contaminated blood
products prior to 1985 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#91:5>
It will also help finance a programme of AIDS-related education
and publicity to help stop the spread of the killer disease . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#92:5>
The move follows a long campaign on the infected haemophiliacs  ' 
behalf by the <it> Sunday Morning Post </it> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#93:5>
The Governor , Mr Chris Patten , yesterday said he was delighted
with the additional help for haemophiliacs , who he described as one of the
neediest groups in the community that deserved greater support and had been
the subject of a &ldquo; proper and sensitive &rdquo; newspaper campaign .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#94:5>
No breakdown of the fund was revealed and it is understood the
Secretary for Health and Welfare , Mrs Elizabeth Wong Chien Chi-lien , will
release more details on Monday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#95:5>
The mother of Ming Tsai , whose plight came to light last
December , one year after he was expelled from his school , expressed concern
about the offer . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#96:5>
&ldquo; I am not sure how much will be offered to us .

<ICE-HK:W2C-011#97:5>
I read news that a boy like my son in Australia got compensation of
about &dollar;2 million .

<ICE-HK:W2C-011#98:5>
We cannot say how much we want but it will be too little if it is
&dollar;200,000 for each , as some newspapers have reported, &rdquo; she said .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#99:5>
&ldquo; I hope he can have a small business when he grows up .

<ICE-HK:W2C-011#100:5>
He is totally ostracised because of this misfortune .

<ICE-HK:W2C-011#101:5>
He still cannot find a school place now . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#102:5>
&ldquo; But I am glad to know that the Government has finally
promised to offer help . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#103:5>
&ldquo; I also want the Government to release details of the
fund as soon as possible .

<ICE-HK:W2C-011#104:5>
We just can not wait .

<ICE-HK:W2C-011#105:5>
One victim , a small boy , is dying in hospital . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#106:5>
The chairman of the 200-strong Hongkong Haemophiliac Association
, known only as Mr Tse , welcomed the Government  ' s decision but said he
wanted to know more details before commenting . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#107:5>
Mr Tse said the requests from its members ranged from
&dollar;200,000 to &dollar;1 million and they were set to have a meeting on
the allowance on March 13 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#108:5>
&ldquo; We planned it and requested the head of the Hongkong
AIDS Foundation , Mrs Peggy Lam Pei Yu-dja , to offer help at the end of last
year, &rdquo; Mr Tse said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#109:5>
The chairman of AIDS Concern , Ms Lisa Ross , welcomed the
prompt response to the demands from the haemophiliacs and hoped to see a
timetable for getting <it> ex-gratia </it> payments and the development of
support services . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#110:5>
Mrs Lam said she was delighted by the &dollar;350 million grant
and had phoned the victims  '  parents immediately after the Legco meeting .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#111:5>
But she warned that the Government must take urgent action
before the HIV victim  ' s problems worsened . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#112:5>
Mr Macleod also proposed a grant of &dollar;100 million to
provide payments to industrial workers suffering from pneumoconiosis , a lung
disease contracted by some quarry and textile workers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-011#113:5>
A &dollar;10 million fund would also be established to provide
immediate interest-free loans to employees injured in work-related accidents .
</p> </I>
