Dear Filippo,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-013#2:1>
How are you ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#3:1>
Surely , you have had a merry Christmas !

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#4:1>
How was your second month in Bremen ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#5:1>
Was the lodging alright ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#6:1>
Have you finally bought a satisfactory second-hand bicycle ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#7:1>
It has been a long time since we parted in Germany . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-013#8:1>
Chloe and I worry about whether you have got our addresses .

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#9:1>
Since we have forgot to give you our addresses , we got up early that
day when we left , hoping that you have not left yet .

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#10:1>
Having realized that there was no response to our calling , we wrote
down our addresses on a piece of paper and placed it under the door .

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#11:1>
Fortunately , I have your address , I have difficulty in reading your
hand-writing nevertheless , I hope my letter can be sent to you without any
mistake ! </p>

<p> Having finished the German course in Bremen , we left for <-> Berline
</-> <+> Berlin </+> .

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#12:1>
You are right , the <-> Berline </-> <+> Berlin </+> people are very
different from that in the other parts of Germany , they are very indifferent
to others .

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#13:1>
Anyway , I enjoyed very much my life in Germany . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-013#14:1>
How is your university life ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#15:1>
Have you made many friends ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#16:1>
Have you found your school life very boring or very exciting ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#17:1>
I will soon graduate , my degree course will have been finished in
the coming summer .

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#18:1>
I am quite occupied with my final year studies and applications for
jobs .

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#19:1>
My German has not been improved much since I can spare little time on
it .

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#20:1>
How about yours ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-013#21:1>
I want to have another Europe trip in the coming summer .

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#22:1>
Yet , all depend on my financial situation at that time .

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#23:1>
How about your trip to H.K. ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#24:1>
I am sure you will be surprised by the densely located high-rise
buildings .

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#25:1>
It is true that Hong Kong is a concrete jungle you have never seen .

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#26:1>
Do remember to drop me a line before you come .

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#27:1>
You will be the most welcomed .

Dear Catherine ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-013#195:12>
I am very happy that I have already finished three mid terms in
this weeks , although there will be another two in mid-March .

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#196:12>
I was ill in Monday that it is hard for me concentrate in studying
, however everything passed now . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-013#197:12>
I have a good news to tell you that for our flower booth , we
have a profit about six hundreds so that we , thirteen members in our group ,
will receive about thirty dollars .

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#198:12>
Besides , all our shareholders will get one dollar <-> dividents
</-> <+> dividends </+> for every fifty-dollar investments .

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#199:12>
But , accounting for all our extra expenses which is not included
in the cost , e.g. lunches , dinners , times , effort , we are losing money
in fact .

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#200:12>
We are now planning to celebrate in next Friday , maybe to have
lunches and karaoke . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#201:12>
It may be difficult for me , in CUHK , to talk due to difference in
system .

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#202:12>
When do I meet you again ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#203:12>
call me if you have time .

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-013#210:13>
I will be a demonstrator of the Computer Festival and I want to
ask you a question .

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#211:13>
What is the difference between Lotus 1-2-3 and Excel ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#212:13>
Please give me a general ides and please say that Lotus 1-2-3 is
more powerful .

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#213:13>
In fact , I have already had some knowledge about Lotus 1-2-3 ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#214:13>

It is also surprising that you will be a <-> demostrator </->
<+> demonstrator </+> of the Computer Festival !

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#221:14>
You are not Computer Science student , why you will a demtor ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#222:14>
Then , what the Computer Science students do in the Computer
Festival </p>

About your question in Application Software , even I don't know
how to use Lotus and Excel because I need not use it .

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#224:14>
In fact , you should know that Computer Science is not only the use
of Application Software .

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#225:14>
Many people know how to use Lotus &obrack; may be you also know it
&cbrack; , but not many of them know how to design a program , or <->
programing </-> <+> programming </+> , I <-> konw </-> <+> know </+> how to
do <-> programing </-> <+> programming </+> but I don't know how to use such
Softwares ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-013#226:14>
About Excel and Lotus , I just know that they are two different
Application Software but do the same thing .

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#227:14>
They are used mostly in business field , e.g. Report making ,
Graphic drawing , Statistic Accounting ..... etc . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-013#228:14>
I think there is not much different between them , their power
are <-> similiar </-> <+> similar </+> .

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#229:14>
Even , you can see that Excel can execute Lotus command !

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#230:14>
If you want to know more , I think other people may help you . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-013#242:15>

I wish me can join together again and talk about our life but I think it is
very hard to do it , right ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-013#243:15>
Since I resigned , I didn't do the facial .

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#244:15>
I am too lazy but I have no problems about my face because I have
sensitive skin and I have no make up anymore . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-013#245:15>
How do you spent in this coming summer holiday ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#246:15>
If you don't want to work , why don't you go to another place ?

You can relax and you can see a lot of things !

<ICE-HK:W1B-013#248:15>
