<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X1:1:Z>
Good morning

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X2:1:Z>
My name is Jonathan Fenby

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X3:1:Z>
I  ' m editor of the South China Morning Post and Sunday Morning Post

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X4:1:Z>
And I  ' d like to welcome you to this the latest of our series of
Saturday morning interview programmes

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X5:1:Z>
Here on Radio Three in which I talk <,> to leading figures in Hong
Kong about themselves their lives their activities and whatever else is on
their mind this weekend <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X6:1:Z>
I  ' m very please to have <?> my </?> guest this morning May Ng who
is director of Friends of the Earth organization here in Hong Kong which uh
as many of you will no doubt know is concern of the <?> whole </?> quality of
the environment and uh the place in which we live

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X7:1:Z>
Imagine this weekend that you went to a <,> quick tour around Hong
Kong Island the New Territories the outline islands uh cross the water
seashore

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X8:1:Z>
What uh is all the negative question to solve with

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X9:1:Z>
Uh what would be the environmental black spots which you expect to
meet

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X10:1:Z>
What would most worry you </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-047#11:1:A>
Well you know for uh uh all average Hong Kong citizen I  ' m
sure you like to take a walk in a country parks <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#12:1:A>
And as you notice all the litters that  ' s left behind particularly
near barbecue site

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#13:1:A>
And some of them being throw out it on in on to the sea

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#14:1:A>
<{2> <[2> That is </[2> really quite an unsightly

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#15:1:A>
You know uh uh scene you want to see on a weekend morning

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#16:1:A>
And then of course the regular traffic jams on major you know
<unc> one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#17:1:A>
Uhm I I I think that is already getting people a bit educated <{3>
<[3> and </[3> getting around town is making life very <,> a big stressful

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#18:1:A>
And also getting into MTR <{4> <[4> I  ' m I  ' m </[4> sure everybody
had that experience

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#19:1:A>
And also <&> tut </&> if you character look at the <?> middle </?>
a lot of these uh container dump site in our New <?> Territorie </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#20:1:A>
If you take a drive near Sha Tau Kok <{5> <[5> <,> you </[5> know
the <?> Kam Tin </?> Road

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#21:1:A>
<{6> <[6> There  ' s </[6> so many <.> degrad </.> <.> degrad </.> uh
<.> de </.> desolated lands which are being abused and <.> re </.> illegally
used as storage container dumps and old car and old tyres dumps

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#22:1:A>
That is not what Hong Kong is proud of is it

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X23:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X24:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X25:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X26:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X27:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X28:1:Z>
<[6> Yes </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X29:1:Z>
Is that killing off the land in fact </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-047#30:1:A>
Oh yes <{1> <[1> I </[1> mean some pollutant coming from leak
oil

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#31:1:A>
<{2> <[2> You </[2> know leakages and <,> <&> tut </&> you know uh
the particularly

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#32:1:A>
No fencing off and no treatment of all the <?> no </?> waste <{3>
<[3> and all </[3> these are <?> olders </?> that  ' s coming through <{4> <[4>
<,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#33:1:A>
And <,> also definitely I think for a lot of Hong Kong people
walking around about

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#34:1:A>
Even shopping areas in downtown or it  ' s in town centre

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#35:1:A>
You feel the fume of the vehicle emissions <{5> <[5> coming </[5>
you know against the van

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#36:1:A>
It  ' s not a very healthy weekend <{6> <[6> <unc> one-word
</unc> </[6>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X37:1:Z>
<[1> But </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X38:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X39:1:Z>
<[3> Yes </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X40:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X41:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X42:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm is <unc> one-word </unc> </[6> </{6> weekend

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X43:1:Z>
I think two of the things are true

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X44:1:Z>
Because of air uhm uhm most <unc> one- word </unc> support
people which are air pollution and the water pollution that

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X45:1:Z>
Just what  ' s the air has that been getting worse

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X46:1:Z>
The air pollution or is it somewhere been for a long time really
particularly diesel uh exhaust <?> fumes </?> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-047#47:1:A>
I guess you know the <,> the the problem with affluence that  ' s
always been more modest

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#48:1:A>
<{1> <[1> And </[1> of course there will be the vehicle increase
has really been unabated

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#49:1:A>
And there  ' s no strategy to really regulate vehicle growth

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#50:1:A>
<{2> <[2> And </[2> also there is no uh you know <.> pro </.>
provisional uh ideas of really

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#51:1:A>
Uh for example using road pricing <{3> <[3> or </[3> even better
road planning and new town planning

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#52:1:A>
You know public transport facilitation

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#53:1:A>
Unfortunately the air pollution problem has been with us for quite
a <{4> <[4> while </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#54:1:A>
But the Hong Kong Government had been <,> you know really <?> call
</?> sort one option approach which is it

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#55:1:A>
Look at it

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#56:1:A>
You know the <?> particular </?> are the source of the pollutants
which is coming from diesel engine <{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#57:1:A>
Actually majority of that pollutant comes from major <?> feet </?>
from our public buses

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#58:1:A>
And yet you know what have they done <{6> <[6> <,> </[6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#59:1:A>
There  ' s a big question you know what

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#60:1:A>
You know now we are of course taking charge of this small diesel
engine like mini buses and <{7> <[7> taxi </[7> drivers

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#61:1:A>
But you know we should be really realistically look at you know a
<?> levelized </?> option to look at uh

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#62:1:A>
What kind of <,> newest technology is available

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#63:1:A>
Uhm <,> how how is the <?> casting </?> of this switch

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#64:1:A>
You know from diesel <{8> <[8> to </[8> petrol <{9> <[9> from </[9>
diesel to uh LPG or from diesel to electric uh whatever

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#65:1:A>
You know we should be given a full option of what to deal with all
these diesel engines

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#66:1:A>
But unfortunately we haven't <,> you know <?> have </?> a what it
is plan with one option <{10> <[10> <,> </[10>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#67:1:A>
And uhm <,> that  ' s why it has <,> you know met with you know such
oppositions

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X68:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X69:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X70:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X71:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X72:1:Z>
<[5> Yeah uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X73:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X74:1:Z>
<[7> Uhm </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X75:1:Z>
<[8> Uhm </[8> </{8>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X76:1:Z>
<[9> Uhm </[9> </{9>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X77:1:Z>
<[10> Uhm uhm </[10> </{10>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X78:1:Z>
But what would be the environment did you doing

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X79:1:Z>
I mean landing is loose to reduce the amount diesel to <unc>
two-words </unc> yes

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X80:1:Z>
How can that be done most effectively </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-047#81:1:A>
Definitely I think <,> uh with uh the <,> the best so far is
actually good maintenance

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#82:1:A>
<{1> <[1> Uh </[1> you know for <{2> <[2> diesel engine </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X83:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X84:1:Z>
<[2> For </[2> </{2> diesel engine themselves </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-047#85:1:A>
Right

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#86:1:A>
But unfortunately taxi drivers wouldn't like to take off half a day

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#87:1:A>
<{> <[> You </[> know form their money making exercises

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#88:1:A>
You know to have their engines but very <unc> one-word
</unc> check and maintained

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#89:1:A>
And a lot of them they just thought you know this is really a minor
thing

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#90:1:A>
Uh what they really need is to be given the uh uh technical uh
assistance and guideline to get a good <,> certified gauges to do good
maintenance programme

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X91:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X92:1:Z>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X93:1:Z>
Then how much the air pollution is also <,> uhm from factories
across the bounder in China coming in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X94:1:Z>
I mean it seems recently people talk about a lot of industrial
point to that

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X95:1:Z>
You seems a great hates uh uh towards uh Shenzhen

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X96:1:Z>
But uhm <,> is that something which is imagine or real

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X97:1:Z>
Do you think <[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-047#98:1:A>
Well definitely before Hong Kong is you know of our our
industry has been really quite a good uh you know stationary source of air
pollutant

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#99:1:A>
<{1> <[1> But </[1> then as the economic development happening in
China so many relocate north <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#100:1:A>
Now with the North wind blowing suddenly we have to sort of have
the impact of <{3> <[3> air </[3> pollution as well

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#101:1:A>
But unfortunately I think in the past few years due to lack of
communications and <.> co </.> cooperation between them you know uh Hong Kong
and and our <,> neighbour across <{4> <[4> the </[4> bounder

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#102:1:A>
There has been really very minimal uh understanding of a base line
data

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#103:1:A>
<{5> <[5> You </[5> know how much of the pollutant

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#104:1:A>
You know actually <{6> <[6> comes from there </[6> base line <?>
datas </?> of you know the <,> the type of pollutants particularly you know
<.> su </.> uh sulphur dioxide nitrogen dioxide you know

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#105:1:A>
We need have a very good base line data

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#106:1:A>
And then <,> base on that to understand year by year the increase
slow pollutants and then also to tackle uh legal <{7> <[7> enforcements </[7>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X107:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X108:1:Z>
<[2> I know </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X109:1:Z>
<[3> Yes </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X110:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X111:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X112:1:Z>
<[6> Yes from there yes </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X113:1:Z>
<[7> Uhm </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X114:1:Z>
That can be tackled to the source

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X115:1:Z>
You can't stop something in the wind blowing over <,> over abroad

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X116:1:Z>
You can't be <{1> <[1> <,> right </[1> there  ' s no one can do
<{2> <[2> that <,> </[2> that

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X117:1:Z>
How effective is the monitoring do you think of air pollution

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X118:1:Z>
I mean what  ' s here story in fact lot of the <,> official
monitoring is done on the top of buildings where the pollution is not at the
level as it is as it we breathe in in the street </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-047#119:1:A>
<[1> Right right </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#120:1:A>
<[2> Uh ha </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#121:1:A>
Yeah in fact there  ' s a lot of Hong Kong people question about the
air pollution index that <{1> <[1> the </[1> government try to set up last
you know year

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#122:1:A>
And uh <,> and uh they were saying you know how realistic it it is

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#123:1:A>
Because most of our Hong Kong population we sort of go to work go
back home and you know take uhm uhm you know city buses

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#124:1:A>
<{2> <[2> And </[2> we are on the road level <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#125:1:A>
And a lot of these of course uh initially in uh ten years ago when
the monitoring station was set up was to monitor industry particularly the
stationary source of <{4> <[4> pollutants </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#126:1:A>
And now knowing that all these are relocated north <{5> <[5> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#127:1:A>
Very </[5> special they remaining uhm major impact of air
pollution is on ground level

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X128:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X129:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X130:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X131:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X132:1:Z>
<[5> <unc> one-word </unc> uh </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X133:1:Z>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X134:1:Z>
Cause we did a a paper we uh hire some monitoring machines and
put them up varies street level places uh last year

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X135:1:Z>
And certainly that <,> the figures we got a very different from
the official figures <{> <[> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X136:1:Z>
Well </[> which uh show what people actually breathing in </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-047#137:1:A>
<[> Oh yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#138:1:A>
Well mind you we got to really be worried about tunnel air <{1>
<[1> qualities </[1> and major bus stop terminal air qualities

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#139:1:A>
All these <?> isolating </?> engine they are <unc> one-word
</unc> <{2> <[2> up </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#140:1:A>
You know in mission and there we are waiting for our public
transport

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#141:1:A>
I mean there is a dilemma there

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#142:1:A>
You encouraging people to take public transport and here you
breathing in <,> all these you know exhaust

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X143:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X144:1:Z>
<[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X145:1:Z>
To those who want to keep motor going so you keep the air
conditioning

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X146:1:Z>
<{1> <[1> That  ' s </[1> why that  ' s cool inside <{2> <[2> <,>
inside

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X147:1:Z>
Everything is </[2> paradox

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X148:1:Z>
What about the water

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X149:1:Z>
The habour and uh <,> the the water quality

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X150:1:Z>
Again something you mention early round

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X151:1:Z>
Uh walking round from <unc> two- words </unc> Sai Kung
country park

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X152:1:Z>
You come across the lovely isolated little beach and it  ' s half
covered with plastic and other rubbish and so on

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X153:1:Z>
Uhm all the wish is be thrown into the sea somewhere else and
wash up

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X154:1:Z>
Is there any way of <,> checking this or controlling this <{3>
<[3> do you think </[3> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-047#155:1:A>
<[1> Right </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#156:1:A>
<[2> That  ' s a paradox you know </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#157:1:A>
<[3> Well let </[3> </{3> me tell you

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#158:1:A>
I think the government need to work out their own <,> better
cooperation and planning

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#159:1:A>
Because here  ' s the Marine Department who say hey this is from
land refuge

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#160:1:A>
You know actually you beach goers you know <{> <[> you hikers you
barbecue </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X161:1:Z>
<[> Yes <unc> several words </unc> </[> </{> in another
week we on this porgramme

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X162:1:Z>
We were talking on resort there was <{> <[> <?> landed </?> </[>
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-047#163:1:A>
<[> Right </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#164:1:A>
And then the the Urban Council or Regional Council manage a beach
say hey wait a minute

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#165:1:A>
It  ' s all from <,> you know the <{1> <[1> the ocean

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#166:1:A>
And </[1> the need of fishing feed you know the the junks and the
you know the the the ships uh you know who cross our ocean has been dumping
<{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#167:1:A>
You know we need to really whatever the source it is

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#168:1:A>
The better cooperation between government departments is really
necessary to come to groups with such a problem <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#169:1:A>
And of course with the EPD and Education Department come into
picture

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#170:1:A>
Better public education and awareness programme

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#171:1:A>
Further more penalties should be considered

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#172:1:A>
You know now we are seriously thinking about smoky vehicles
brought uh uh you know uh penalties why not the same with you know people who
just <?> litterous </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#173:1:A>
<{4> <[4> Who </[4> care nothing about <,> you know our natural
species and our <{5> <[5> shorelines </[5>

<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5> uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X179:1:Z>
How <.> lev </.> how high do you think the level of <unc>
one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X180:1:Z>
I mean something you are in opposite

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X181:1:Z>
You are working on a whole time

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X182:1:Z>
I would like it it cannot be high enough for you </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-047#183:1:A>
Did you hear about the latest survey from uh Chinese
University uh no uh I think Hong Kong University

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#184:1:A>
We you know they did uh uh uh uh people uh <,> Hong Kong public uh
awareness uh uh environmental awareness <{1> <[1> uhm </[1> survey

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#185:1:A>
They call up <.> hund </.> a thousand five hundred people by
telephone

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#186:1:A>
And uh you know what the result is

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#187:1:A>
Ninety percent of them said yes I would certainly support the
environment

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#188:1:A>
The rest of them <{2> <[2> well </[2> <,> if I have to pay sorry I  ' m
<{3> <[3> I  ' m </[3> I  ' m not sure

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#189:1:A>
And well we place its uh ranking with the other rest of the world
<,> <&> tut </&> with thirty nine cities

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#190:1:A>
<{4> <[4> We </[4> rank last <{5> <[5> as </[5> number thirty nine
in our environmental awareness and support for the environment

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#191:1:A>
Even behind China which has <,> fifty nine percent supporting
environment

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#192:1:A>
And India we know who is even better than we <{6> <[6> do </[6>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X193:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X194:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X195:1:Z>
<[3> Yeah </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X196:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X197:1:Z>
<[5> In </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X198:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X199:1:Z>
This is Jonathan Fenby talking to May Ng from Friends of the
Earth

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X200:1:Z>
Here on Radio Three the Saturday morning

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X201:1:Z>
This is all are worrying a negative result

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X202:1:Z>
But there are positive side of the environment <unc> one-word
</unc> <{1> <[1> here

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X203:1:Z>
Still </[1> country parks <{2> <[2> <,> trees </[2> <unc>
one-word </unc> and so on

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X204:1:Z>
What uhm <,> do do you find most precious there </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-047#205:1:A>
<[1> Oh yes </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#206:1:A>
<[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#207:1:A>
Well I I I guess you know thanks to the to the you know Hong Kong
Government I think

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#208:1:A>
Uh <.> par </.> particularly Governor Maclehose who has put in
place a very good country park ordinance who protected fourteen percent of
our country of our land which is turn into country park beautiful country
park

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#209:1:A>
And mind you we have five hundred kilometers of beautiful
coastline <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> and which really uh you know wonders in you
know in this part of the world

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#210:1:A>
And uh <,> but we don't forget you know that  ' s all recent
misleading thought that Hong Kong has no biodiversity no no special species

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#211:1:A>
<{2> <[2> We </[2> have <,> <?> two </?> two thousand five hundred
vernacular plants species even more than UK <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#212:1:A>
And uh you know our our tree <{4> <[4> species <,> </[4> is so
special

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#213:1:A>
<{5> <[5> It  ' s </[5> even more than all western <{6> <[6>
European put together </[6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#214:1:A>
And <,> and and and then there is also <,> <&> tut </&> you know
the completeness of our transport system which take us everywhere

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#215:1:A>
There  ' s no need for cars

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#216:1:A>
And and I I think Hong Kong people are not really uh brought to
the to the uh uh uh attention that such treasures is really very special for
Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#217:1:A>
And that makes it attractive for our most revenue generating
industry tourism industry

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#218:1:A>
That what brings thousand you know eight hundred <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#219:1:A>
Was it eighty billion uh Hong Kong <{7> <[7> dollars </[7> uh
eighteen billion eight hundred billion <{8> <[8> Hong Kong dollars <,> every
year </[8>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X220:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X221:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X222:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X223:1:Z>
<[4> The tree yeah yeah </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X224:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X225:1:Z>
<[6> In Europe they have some <unc> one-word </unc> </[6>
</{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X226:1:Z>
<[7> Uhm </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X227:1:Z>
<[8> <?> Eight billion </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X228:1:Z>
But most of the </[8> </{8> visitors <,> don't <?> how </?> to
country park let  ' s say

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X229:1:Z>
And for most of the image of Hong Kong is that <,> very much of a
compact uh glass and concrete and steel city </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-047#230:1:A>
Right

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#231:1:A>
But then there is a potential to increase this kind of ego ego
tourism

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#232:1:A>
<{1> <[1> And </[1> there is potential to even you know a need you
know in this areas particularly link up with China

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#233:1:A>
And what better potential there is for for Hong Kong enrich
treasure

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#234:1:A>
What we  ' ve got as our natural asset <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> uh that
is one area which you know we can think of

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#235:1:A>
But you know in a brighter picture actually Hong Kong can look
future in the next fifty years if we take care of you know the uhm the number
of people we can accommodate here

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#236:1:A>
Presently we have six million <{3> <[3> but </[3> as we you know
according to the uh census we have taken

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#237:1:A>
An increase of a million every decade

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#238:1:A>
We will be heading towards ten million people by fifty years from
now

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#239:1:A>
Now the picture in front of this how do we fulfill the need of
these many people

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#240:1:A>
Unless government policy are made very missionary proactive now to
start and think

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#241:1:A>
And here  ' s the good opportunity for a future executive Mr Tung a
golden opportunity to say hey let  ' s stand stand back

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#242:1:A>
And look at what <,> decision are being made

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#243:1:A>
And do we can we cope with ten million people

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#244:1:A>
And now that golden opportunities there are areas for innovative
solutions

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#245:1:A>
You know like for energy need we can actually tap into <,> you
know our own solar energy

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#246:1:A>
You know we got one thousand <,> and ninety one kilometers square
of landmarks which <{4> <[4> has </[4> you know uh uh you know an an solar
energy

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#247:1:A>
And that keep uh actually produce you know five thousand seven
hundred and sixty two billion mega <unc> one-word </unc> of solar <,>
energy <{5> <[5> per year </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#248:1:A>
Yes and we have in make best use of it <unc> one-word
</unc> we  ' ve got the coastline uhm for <{6> <[6> wind energy </[6>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X249:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X250:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X251:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X252:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X253:1:Z>
<[5> Sound <unc> one-word </unc> </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X254:1:Z>
<[6> Are you </[6> </{6> worry about the land use </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-047#255:1:A>
<{1> <[1> Definitely </[1> I I think uh we hope the future
<,> uh chief executive would really you <{2> <[2> know </[2> commit to also
protection of a country park while also better use of our lands

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#256:1:A>
Look at the you know illegal the the dumping site in New <?>
Territorie </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#257:1:A>
<{3> <[3> If </[3> we can really put that as a priority to
rehabilitate them to turn into good uses

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#258:1:A>
And and also urban renewal that has been put in a very low <{4>
<[4> priority </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#259:1:A>
There  ' s always constant cry for <,> oh no oh not enough land to
hold <,> you know to uh uh accommodate ten million people

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#260:1:A>
Or reclaim the harbour you know <{5> <[5> that  ' s </[5> the
easiest the the the shortest and the <{6> <[6> <,> the the revenue generating
option </[6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#261:1:A>
But here we have the graded <unc> one-word </unc> to be
<{7> <[7> rehabilitated </[7>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#262:1:A>
There urban renewal that has to be really you know <unc>
one-word </unc>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X263:1:Z>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X264:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X265:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X266:1:Z>
<[4> Yeah </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X267:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X268:1:Z>
<[6> So that  ' s why the <unc> two-words </unc> yes <,>
yes </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X269:1:Z>
<[7> Uhm </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X270:1:Z>
There  ' s also old building which can be <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> uh
renewed and <{2> <[2> <unc> one-word </unc> </[2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-047#271:1:A>
<[1> Right </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#272:1:A>
<[2> Maybe even </[2> </{2> change of you know use

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#273:1:A>
Like a lot of industries relocated to to to China

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#274:1:A>
There is a lot of industrial buildings <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> which
are sitting there empty

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#275:1:A>
Because of you know the land use or because the <,> you know the
the the original use is needed to be <,> <?> which </?> uh rethink <{2> <[2>
and </[2> no change

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#276:1:A>
So I think <,> in more innovative and more creative solutions <?>
needs </?> to be thought out

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#277:1:A>
You know to fulfill the need of that many people and their demand
for housing

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X278:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X279:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X280:1:Z>
How much political awareness is there concern among politicians

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X281:1:Z>
You write to Mr Tung and then you write an open letter to him uh
on environmental future or

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X282:1:Z>
Do politicians here give much time much concern you think to this
kind of environmental matters </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-047#283:1:A>
Unfortunately I guess uh we have a very few channels for
lobbying <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#284:1:A>
Uh previously and of course we try Mr <,> uh Patten <{2> <[2>
<,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#285:1:A>
Uh I guess his hands his hands too full and uh he had other
priorities

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#286:1:A>
Uhm then we <{3> <[3> try </[3>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X287:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X288:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X289:1:Z>
<[3> <unc> one-word </unc> </[3> </{3> did they lay out
quite a lot of environmental programme <{> <[> <,> in </[> the first year
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-047#290:1:A>
<[> Oh yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#291:1:A>
Yes he he he committed a a very big budget

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#292:1:A>
<{1> <[1> He </[1> he he <?> so </?> increase manpower for the
<{2> <[2> <,> </[2> Environmental Protection Department you know good budget

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#293:1:A>
I think he cared but he had such no time

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#294:1:A>
But then you know with legislators here and politicians we find it
very difficult to help them see you know there are long term <,> you know
gains and benefit

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#295:1:A>
You know if the <.> qu </.> we  ' ve we are talking about <,>
livelihood issue

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#296:1:A>
We  ' ve been talking about quality of life issues

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#297:1:A>
But particularly they are just looking at short term it uh you
know result

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#298:1:A>
And short term you know benefit without really looking at long
term

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#299:1:A>
And uh we  ' ve found we have few legislators to lobby uh you only a
few committed

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#300:1:A>
If you look at the reason uh to deal with air pollution

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#301:1:A>
The uhm the proposal to change uh to uh urge <,> taxi <.> dri </.>
uh <unc> one-word </unc> to change from diesel <{3> <[3> to <.> petr
</.> </[3> uh <{4> <[4> petrol

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#302:1:A>
That </[4> is the vote is so shameful

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#303:1:A>
You know uhm uhm majority don't even support such an initiative
like you said

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#304:1:A>
It could be intern measure

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#305:1:A>
We can deal with air pollution for the moment while we try to more
innovative

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#306:1:A>
You know long term technology quick <{5> <[5> uh </[5> you know
fix uh fixation of this problem

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#307:1:A>
But we found that <,> so difficult

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#308:1:A>
Because they are catering the need of their voters uh to their you
know the taxi drivers could be one <{6> <[6> strong voices </[6>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X309:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X310:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X311:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X312:1:Z>
<[4> Petrol uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X313:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-047#X314:1:Z>
<[6> A quite of taxi </[6> </{6> drivers without the <,> drivers
and give you light driving cars </X> </I>
