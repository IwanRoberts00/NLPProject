<bold> The Rehabilitation Development Coordinating Committee and the
Future of Services Concerning People with Disabilities in Hong Kong </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-019#2:1>
The Rehabilitation Development Coordinating Committee &obrack;
RDCC &cbrack; was created by the 1977 White Paper on &ldquo; Integrating the
disabled into the community &dash; a United Effort &rdquo; to coordinate
services concerning people with disabilities and to advise government on the
development , implementation and principles of subvention of these services .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#3:1>
Its members are all appointed by the Governor .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#4:1>
The White Paper also gave support to the creation of a new post , the
Commissioner for Rehabilitation to coordinate , develop and supervise all
concerned activities . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-019#5:1>
These policy initiatives on rehabilitation administration and
coordination have been the foundations for the remarkable achievements of the
1970  ' s and early 1980  ' s .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#6:1>
This period also witnessed important personal attention and support by
the Governor and heads of government secretariats and departments concerned
in ensuring the effective implementation of the policy initiatives . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-019#7:1>
During the first decade of <-> implementarion </-> <+>
implementation </+> of the 1977 White paper , official members sitting on the
RDCC were almost all heads of secretariats and departments .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#8:1>
Furthermore , the appointed Chairman was a member of both Executive
and Legislative Councils , as well as the elected chairman of the
coordinating body for the non-governmental sector , the Joint Council for the
Physically and Mentally disabled &obrack; Rehabilitation Division , Hong Kong
Council of Social Service &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#9:1>
During these years , RDCC had demonstrated high qualities of
initiative and leadership , and fulfilled its purposes of assisting the
government in developing a comprehensive programme of disability prevention
and rehabilitation , i.e. the 10-year Rolling Rehabilitation Programme Plan .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#10:1>
Hong Kong should be pleased that the Plan has received high praise
from a number of United Nations organizations and non-governmental
international communities concerning disabilities . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-019#11:1>
Into the 1980's a series of important world events concerning
disabilities have taken place .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#12:1>
These include the 1981 International Year of Disabled Persons , the
UN Decade of Disabled Persons 1983-1992 , and the UN World <-> Proramme </->
<+> Programme </+> of Action Concerning People with Disabilities .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#13:1>
Complementing the significant impacts of these world events , heads
of nations and leaders of non-governmental international organizations are
giving increasing personal attention in , and commitment to , implementing
new philosophies and programme initiatives concerning people with
disabilities .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#14:1>
The world is indeed moving with big steps forward in the field of
disability prevention and rehabilitation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-019#15:1>
At such a time of fast world action , and at a time when Hong
Kong is in a critical stage of political transition , the RDCC , however ,
has shown weaknesses in maintaining a credibility and leadership that would
match the expectations of the professional and disabled communities of Hong
Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#16:1>
One major difficulty is the diminishing quality of participation of
government departments in RDCC .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#17:1>
The status of official representatives has changed significantly with
heads of government secretaries and departments no longer attended committee
meetings in person , nor their second-in-commands .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#18:1>
Such a change indicates a silent but observable process which lowers
the priority of rehabilitation programmes in government secretariat and
departmental operations . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-019#19:1>
Understandably , RDCC does not have administrative authority over
government departments .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#20:1>
Its effectiveness lies only in its expertise , reasoning power and
influence .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#21:1>
Now that its direct dialogue with major decision makers in government
secretaries and departments concerned is gone , it has lost the effective
tool of direct communication .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#22:1>
RDCC has to work with mid-level management to bridge time
communication gap , but such arrangements have proven time consuming and
practically ineffective .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#23:1>
Regrettably the strength of RDCC in coordinating programmes
concerning disabled people , which cuts across over 14 government departments
and involves around 100 non-governmental organizations , has now been much
eroded . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-019#24:1>
The close relationship between RDCC and the non-governmental
coordinating body , the Joint Council of the Physically and Mentally Disabled
&obrack; Rehabilitation Division , Hong Kong Council of Social Service
&cbrack; has been another crucial factor leading to the early successes of
RDCC .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#25:1>
Member organizations of the Joint Council include service providers ,
associations of people with disabilities , and professional bodies .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#26:1>
Together they shoulder a very significant role in service provision
and they are in daily contacts with people with disabilities. Moreover , over
its 26 years of history , the Joint Council has been well recognized in the
world for its achievements in the field of disability prevention and
rehabilitation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#27:1>
Given its strong service and people bases , and its proven record of
experience and expertise , the institution of a formal relationship between
the RDCC and the Joint Council would be greatly beneficial to the Government
and the society .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#28:1>
This can be effected by granting the Joint Council the privilege of
nominating members to the RDCC . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-019#29:1>
Since the 1980's , the government budget concerning disabilities
prevention and rehabilitation has grown rapidly and significantly .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#30:1>
The rehabilitation budget however spreads over a large number of
governmental and non-governmental organizations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#31:1>
From the perspective of certain government departments , the
rehabilitation budget is but a minority item .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#32:1>
And minority budget item may easily be overlooked or denied the
appropriate attention .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#33:1>
Therefore there is a need to identify a body to advise the Government
on its annual rehabilitation budget exercise , and to give special attention
to the cost effectiveness and efficiency of the money spent . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-019#34:1>
One of the major functions of the post of Commissioner of
Rehabilitation is to coordinate the very diverse programmes concerning
disabled person .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#35:1>
Effective coordination requires close cooperation among government
departments and between the governmental and non-government sectors .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#36:1>
Experiences of the past several years have shown that government
departments are becoming less enthusiastic to initiatives taken by the
Commissioner for effective coordination .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#37:1>
Such a regrettable situation does not come as a surprise at a time
when government departments are becoming more distracted by the increasing
number of public issues .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#38:1>
The situations can only be expected to get worse when some major
government programmes , such as the hospital services , are being taken over
by the non-governmental statutory bodies .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#39:1>
There is therefore a strong need to strengthen the status of the post
of Commissioner for Rehabilitation , so that it can command the necessary
attention and cooperation of related government departments and statutory
bodies . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-019#40:1>
Hong Kong is now preparing a new White Paper on measures
concerning disabled people for the 1990's and the next century .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#41:1>
This is the most appropriate time to carry out an in-depth review of
the functions of the RDCC so that it will be well equipped to deal with
future challenges , to fulfil the objectives set by the Governor and to
enhance its leadership and credibility .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#42:1>
The following recommendations should therefore be given full
consideration by the government:

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#43:1>
&obrack; 1 &cbrack; to encourage heads of secretaries and departments
concerned to attend RDCC meetings.

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#44:1>
&obrack; 2 &cbrack; to allow the Joint Council to nominate three
representatives to the RDCC , with at least one from its member organizations
of disabled people and their guardians.

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#45:1>
&obrack; 3 &cbrack; to appoint a chairman of the RDCC from among
members of the Legislative and/or Executive Council who would have a proven
record demonstrating his/her devotion and commitment in the field of
disability prevention and rehabilitation.

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#46:1>
&obrack; 4 &cbrack; to allow RDCC to play an advisory role in the
preparation of government  ' s overall rehabilitation budget as well as
individual departmental rehabilitation budget.

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#47:1>
&obrack; 5 &cbrack; to grant the Commissioner for Rehabilitation
attendance in major budgetary and policy regular meetings chaired by the
Chief Secretary . </p> </I>

<bold> 1. Introduction </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-019#50:2>
The Report of the Working Group Set Up to Review Language
Improvement Measures is , perhaps , the first attempt on the part of the
Government to come to grips with the very complex language situation in Hong
Kong : the relationship between Chinese and English &semi; the declining
standard in both English and Chinese &semi; the problems of using English as
the language of instruction in schools and the necessity of language planning
in Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-019#51:2>
It is the intention of the author to examine the two key issues
in the report regarding the medium of instruction and the streaming according
to English language proficiency at Primary Six .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#52:2>
These will be analyzed on the <-> basic </-> <+> <?> basis </?> </+>
of two criteria :

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#53:2>
a &dash; whether the true problem &obrack;s&cbrack; have been
identified and b &dash; whether workable solutions have been prescribed by
the report . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#54:2>
<bold> 2 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#55:2>
The English Language in Schools </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-019#56:2>
A close scrutiny of the report reveals a rather disappointing
scenario .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#57:2>
Despite its pledge to promote bilingual education , the report deals
almost exclusively on the teaching and the learning of English in Schools .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#58:2>
The teaching and the learning of Chinese and Putonghua are given <->
negligeable </-> <+> negligible </+> mentioning .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#59:2>
Judging from the way the report tackles the question of bilingual
education , one just wonders whether this is yet another of the government  ' s
half-hearted efforts in promoting bilingual abilities in Hong Kong students .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-019#60:2>
The question of the medium of instruction is examined within the
report on the basis of two premises .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#61:2>
Firstly , the report claims that only 30&percent; of the secondary
school population can reap cognitive benefit from English as a medium of
instruction &semi;

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#62:2>
secondly , it holds that mixing Cantonese and English in the
classroom is undesirable and should be discouraged .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#63:2>
The first premise is flawed because neither is cognitive benefit
clearly defined nor is the use of English as a medium of instruction truly
functional as it is practised in Hong Kong today .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#64:2>
The second premise is highly suspicious because it is a widely agreed
view among sociolinguists that code mixing &obrack; or code switching
&cbrack; serves very definite social and societal purposes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#65:2>
Indeed , code mixing happens continuously around us in Hong Kong and
in many places in the world .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#66:2>
It is neither undesirable nor unnatural .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#67:2>
It is , therefore , very perplexing to find in the report a
categorical denial of code mixing in the classroom . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-019#68:2>
Many may think that the classroom is a place where purity of
thought and language should be the rule .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#69:2>
Alas , we have witnessed terrible failures in education resulting
from such a view .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#70:2>
Sex education is one case in point .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#71:2>
Language education is yet another .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#72:2>
To try to enforce purity of language use in the classroom the
educator is , in fact , creating an artificial language context &semi; and
all language teaching professionals agree that nothing is more damaging to
language learning than an artificial language context .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#73:2>
Has the Working Group ever considered models of bilingual education
where code mixing is an inherent and contributing feature ? </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#74:2>
<bold> 3. The Problem with Streaming </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-019#75:2>
To resolve the medium of instruction question the Report proposes
to stream students according to their English language ability before they
enter secondary education .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#76:2>
Those screened in will be placed in schools with English as the
medium of instruction &semi; those screened out will be placed in Chinese
medium schools .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#77:2>
This is certainly not a viable solution even granting that the
question of medium of instruction should be resolved in the way the Report
suggests . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-019#78:2>
The mechanism proposed through which streaming is done is a
battery of language tests .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#79:2>
It is not clear what the function of such a test would be .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#80:2>
If it were to assess the mastery of what is in the school English
syllabus &obrack; achievement &cbrack; , the question should be asked as to
the <-> extend </-> <+> extent </+> the school English syllabus reflects the
English in use as a medium of instruction .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#81:2>
This has still to be established .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#82:2>
If the test were to assess students  '  English ability in general
&obrack; proficiency &cbrack; , the question should be asked as to the ways
English is taught and learnt in Hong Kong primary classrooms .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#83:2>
English could be learnt as a school subject like many other rather
than as a real language .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#84:2>
If the test were to assess natural ability for language learning
&obrack; aptitude &cbrack; , the question should be asked as to what
constitutes language aptitude : a question which there is as yet no definite
answer .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#85:2>
Due to these still unanswered questions, the suggestion to use a yet
<-> underfined </-> <+> <?> undefined </?> </+> language test <-> batter </->
<+> <?> better </?> </+> to do the job of streaming is premature to say the
least . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-019#86:2>
There is , perhaps , the question of cost effectiveness in the
proposal of streaming .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#87:2>
It can be claimed that the limited resources for education can best
be deployed for those who can benefit .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#88:2>
Such a view hides in it subtle dangers .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#89:2>
Cost in such a view is measured in dollar terms for the government
purse and effectiveness is in terms of the maintenance of the society as a
whole .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#90:2>
But cost is also measurable in human and individual terms .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#91:2>
What does cost amount to for those screened out ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#92:2>
Even if Hong Kong may need only 30&percent; for our primary student
population to achieve a good standard of English , to give to only
30&percent; of the opportunity may run the risk of wasting some 20 or more
percentage of usable talent if there was some 50&percent; or more in the
student population capable of <-> achieveing </-> <+> achieving </+> the same
standard . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-019#93:2>
Streaming 70&percent; of P.6 students out in order to allow the
remaining 30&percent; benefit from using English as a medium of instruction
is , perhaps , a piece of economic planning but certainly not an educational
one .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#94:2>
The hope of success of streaming is very questionable to say the
least and the side-effects are too easy to see .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#95:2>
To make the best and the highest investment return of a limited
educational budget it may be necessary to implement streaming .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#96:2>
On the other hand , in order <quote> &ldquo; to promote bilingual
skills in Chinese and English among all students in schools at both primary
and secondary levels &rdquo; </quote> , what is needed is a revision on what
has gone wrong in the present bilingual educational policy and instructional
practices .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#97:2>
It is certainly perplexing to see that it is the students who are
asked to make sacrifices .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#98:2>
If the 70&percent; screened out will be deprived of the chance of
developing their English ability , the 30&percent; screened in will be
deprived of the opportunity to develop their Chinese ability , which all
native Chinese speakers in Hong Kong see as needing urgent attention .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#99:2>
It is a all-lose situation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#100:2>
Bilingual education deserves more than just lip-service and
slogan-launching . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-019#101:2>
One of the most serious side-effect in streaming is its being
elitist and socially divisive .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#102:2>
There is no common educational goal to be achieved by the students
after streaming .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#103:2>
The effect of streaming will remain for the rest of the formal
educational carrier of the students &dash; a responsibility certainly too
onerous for twelve/thirteen year olds .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#104:2>
It is not enough to say that there is no status difference between
English medium and Chinese medium schools .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#105:2>
The fact is that if the students and their parents had no right to
choose , the feeling of inequality would be all too real . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-019#106:2>
The effects of streaming on the students are not difficult to
understand .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#107:2>
Instead of having opportunities opening up , students realize that
options begin to narrow as soon as they start their secondary education .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#108:2>
The problem is that the students don't feel that they have a choice
in their future . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#109:2>
4. Conclusion </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-019#110:2>
Streaming is not necessarily a bad thing , if it leads to a
common educational goal and equal opportunity for all .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#111:2>
What is being suggested in the present proposal of streaming looks
dangerously like streaming for streaming  ' s sake with no valid bilingual
educational objective beyond .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#112:2>
It has been argued that the present proposal on streaming has been
done with little serious thinking given to bilingual education as the
practitioners know it .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#113:2>
Neither is it based on truly impartial research evidence nor will it
be done with a fair and valid measuring instrument .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#114:2>
It seems that what the government wants is to pay for 30&percent; of
the student population to have an English medium instruction &semi; and
30&percent; will the government take up as its responsibility .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#115:2>
This is not untypical of a paternalistic government with too keen an
eye on economic planning . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-019#116:2>
Hong Kong has long prided herself on what individual endeavour
can do to better his or her lot despite initial disadvantage due to birth or
lost opportunities .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#117:2>
Does it not appear that it is perhaps too early to shut the door to
equal educational opportunities to many of our twelve/thirteen year olds if
streaming was to be implemented .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#118:2>
Hong Kong may have to bit farewell to the possibility of developing
a truly bilingual community and the maintenance of that very lovable
restlessness which captures so well the perception that opportunities are
always there to grasp .

<ICE-HK:W2A-019#119:2>
This is a vitality that is the envy of the world and which would be
such a pity to lose . </p> </I>
