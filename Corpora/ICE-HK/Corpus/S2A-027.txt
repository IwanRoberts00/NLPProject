<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-027#1:1:A>
Uhm uh thank you Doctor Chan

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#2:1:A>
I first of all I I must thank you all for inviting me to attend this
uh very important open forum

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#3:1:A>
Uhm probably uh ever since I have taken up the directorship in this
polytechnic I have highlighted one very important ingredient to the way I run
this institution is to improve <?> and </?> enhance the channel of
communication

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#4:1:A>
And I I think this is very important

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#5:1:A>
Now especially when we are introducing such a important uhm
structural change in the in the institutions so I I do want to make every
member of staff in the institution both academic and equivalent
administrative <?> to have </?> a clear understanding what we are doing

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#6:1:A>
So there  ' s no misunderstanding whatsoever

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#7:1:A>
Now uh I I think this provides a good opportunity for us to try to
explain to you some of the query you may have

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#8:1:A>
And from then on <?> to </?> see uhm how we can make you feel
comfortable about the whole thing

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#9:1:A>
Uh well I believe the my my open letter to all members of staff have
outlined the background and the reason of doing so which I don't want to
repeat again

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#10:1:A>
Not to waste your time

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#11:1:A>
But one thing I want to emphasize is that ever since we have uh
received the letter from <?> UPTC </?> indicating the the government  ' s
concern of of uh implementation of <?> pater </?> salary

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#12:1:A>
They believe that one principle must be upheld and that is that uh
teacher teaching similar courses at the same level should be awarded the same

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#13:1:A>
Well <?> this  ' s </?> a very important concept of equity because
<.> or </.> according to our original proposal to the government hoping that
all members of our staff will be transferred over to be to have university
salary

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#14:1:A>
Now base on that the government cannot accept it based on one
principle

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#15:1:A>
The principle of what what I just mentioned

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#16:1:A>
And also it  ' s a practical difficulties because in our in our in
our staff structure there may be staff who are teaching sub degrees as first
degrees with different ratios or proportions

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#17:1:A>
So there could be staff teaching mainly sub degrees and if they are
given the so called university salary <,> that means the government will have
a difficult time in future answering to any possible request from VTC so
called technical college

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#18:1:A>
They are essentially teaching sub degrees for similar treatment
because they can always quote polytechnic examples that because our staff who
are teaching primarily sub degrees are given university salary then technical
college could claim for the same treatment

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#19:1:A>
And this is a very serious snow balling effect and the government
can definitely <?> not in </?> the position support that

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#20:1:A>
So government got to be firm on on on this equity and uh so we have
no alternative but to accept it or reject it

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#21:1:A>
Now if we <unc> one-word </unc> reject the total proposal
of <?> pater </?> salary then you can you can foresee that the future
prospect of further development of this polytechnic in comparison with that
of City Polytechnic Baptist and Ling Nan will be in an extremely
disadvantageous position

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#22:1:A>
So if we have got to accept this <?> parity </?> salary issue then
we have got to follow government  ' s very stringent criteria and that is total
equity

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#23:1:A>
That means staff must be engage in teaching degrees <?> must be
engaged </?> in teaching degree work and no more in order to enjoy <?> the so
called </?> university salary

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#24:1:A>
So we were put in such a very <?> difficult </?> position because
our our staff is essentially teaching both degrees and sub degrees

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#25:1:A>
And it is therefore it is up to us whether we we want to accept
government  ' s offer or not

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#26:1:A>
And we feel that we have we have got to accept the offer

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#27:1:A>
And we have got to face the difficult task of how to separate our
staff in two groups

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#28:1:A>
Those who can enjoy parity and those who can't

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#29:1:A>
So we have consider various options

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#30:1:A>
So the best option we thought is is the first principle is that no
member of staff should suffer as a result of this

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#31:1:A>
That  ' s no detrimental principles are applied

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#32:1:A>
Therefore <,> we can only regard those we could we have got to <.>
c </.> carry out some kind of screen exercise

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#33:1:A>
Those who can screen in will enjoy the <?> parity salary </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#34:1:A>
Those those who are not successful will remain as what they are
doing

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#35:1:A>
So that  ' s no no issue of you have got to apply for the same job
again

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#36:1:A>
So those who want to transfer to the <?> so called </?> college or
degree studies you have got to apply for to for for consideration

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#37:1:A>
If you don't want to go over you don't have to apply for anything
at all

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#38:1:A>
You will not not suffer

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#39:1:A>
So this is a fundamental principle

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#40:1:A>
And no one will be uh forced to go uh go down to a lower grade

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#41:1:A>
We are not creating a second class <unc> one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#42:1:A>
What we are doing is that we create a college as if this is uh
another <.> pr or </.> promotion prospect

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#43:1:A>
Because at present we have got the L to SL to PL <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#44:1:A>
From every promotion exercise there  ' s bound to be competitions

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#45:1:A>
Only a a selective few can can be successful

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#46:1:A>
Those who apply <?> may not be </?> successful

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#47:1:A>
So we are creating another opportunity for transfer as if this is
promotion

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#48:1:A>
So members all are welcome to apply for transfer

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#49:1:A>
Those who are successful are lucky

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#50:1:A>
Good luck to you

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#51:1:A>
Those who are not successful I  ' m not I won't say too bad but you
have got second chance next year the year after

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#52:1:A>
So that is the principle behind

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#53:1:A>
Now also we want to ensure that as much consultation as possible

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#54:1:A>
Therefore uh you appreciate that we have got to keep this strictly
confidential before the whole package is is have been followed <?> for </?>
through because leakage or or mess of this kind without the true
understanding could be extremely uh detrimental to the morale because people
just have rumors around what  ' s going on

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#55:1:A>
That  ' s why the discussion among the senior <?> management </?>
group was conducted in strictly confidential manner without leakage of
anything to the to any member of staff including <unc> one-word
</unc> department and all the way down

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#56:1:A>
So the whole thing was structured in such a way that the on the
twenty eighth of that day so in the morning I have when this letter was
issued out I am meeting the heads of department informing informing heads of
department the whole package and then try to discuss with them

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#57:1:A>
In the afternoon I have meetings with PSAs as well as with students

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#58:1:A>
Because whole the whole idea has no <.> im </.> <?> if </?> effect
on student at all because we are not creating two separate colleges

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#59:1:A>
Students are all students of Polytechnic

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#60:1:A>
They receive awards on Polytechnic

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#61:1:A>
Nothing will change

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#62:1:A>
Now <?> following </?> that uh immediately then the key thing of
course is is the the is criteria of transfer

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#63:1:A>
Therefore we have to at first draw up a criteria that will send out
to all department heads and division chairman

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#64:1:A>
They were asked to consult among themselves came up with the second
draft <unc> one-word </unc> some idea so on

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#65:1:A>
Then the following Monday Directory and Division chairman base on
input from department heads as a first input we <?> re </?> consider draft
<unc> two- words </unc> first revision

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#66:1:A>
Base on that first revision so PSA and and the the one has that <?>
they </?> issue copies

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#67:1:A>
Then the one has to <?> unite </?> to consult your colleagues in
the same department at different departmental meeting and PSA should have
consult your staff

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#68:1:A>
So base on that sort of criteria <,> the consultation uh took place
<?> throughout </?> about a week or so

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#69:1:A>
Up until last Saturday the heads of departments together with PSA
representatives and Directory has a <.> sec </.> has the so called the third
meeting

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#70:1:A>
So we collect inputs from all the heads who should have consulted
the uh colleagues in the department to get <?> the </?> PSA  ' s input

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#71:1:A>
Whereas a third look at the draft criteria is based on which we
collect all the inputs

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#72:1:A>
And this morning we further discuss with with all the inputs from
the department heads that is from the teachers on the one hand PSA on the
other we examined the draft and came up with the <?> very </?> final draft
again

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#73:1:A>
So you can see that we try to take as much input from staff as
possible through PSA and also from departments

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#74:1:A>
Now I also feel that members that would like to have an opportunity
to have a direct communication like in this <?> forum </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#75:1:A>
So I I suggest to you and your chairman that if your PSA wants uh
open forum to have direct dialogue with myself and my senior colleagues who
are here

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#76:1:A>
Uh I welcome this opportunity because it is only through this
direct dialogue and trying on our part to explain to you the backgrounds that
will help us to implement this whole very important policy that I I I firmly
believe that is only good for the future of this Polytechnic because uh I
don't think we can afford not to accept government  ' s offer of <?> parity
</?> salary

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#77:1:A>
Now that  ' s all I want to say for the time being </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-027#78:2:A>
In fact uh <,> I do feel <?> that </?> member of staff if you
want to ask the questions in English or or Cantonese you are most welcome

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#79:2:A>
Because I I I think communication should be in the most efficient
way and uh I am quite prepared to answer questions in <.> ei </.> either
English or Cantonese <.> a </.>

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#80:2:A>
And if questions are asked in Cantonese I hope my <?> expatriate
</?> colleagues will will bear with this and <unc> one-word </unc>
your friends sitting next to you can can can interpret <?> them </?> </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-027#81:3:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#82:3:A>
Thank you very much

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#83:3:A>
Now may I I attempt to answer <,> both questions and my my senior
colleagues could chip in and and then and then elaborate a bit further

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#84:3:A>
Now the primary issues

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#85:3:A>
In fact <,> there are two basic things here

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#86:3:A>
Uh every <unc> one-word </unc> institutions keep on saying
that they want to have their own autonomy in deciding uh how institutions run

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#87:3:A>
Now uh for instance uh <,> salary salary part is controlled
essentially by government

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#88:3:A>
And to go with that there is called housing benefits uh and then
the passage said all controlled by government

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#89:3:A>
They are all the same

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#90:3:A>
<,> This is a these are the most fundamental benefit is the salary
the housing benefits the passages they <?> are </?> all identical

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#91:3:A>
Now the variation could be in say the uh as you mentioned SSR

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#92:3:A>
That in fact SSR if you look at the <unc> one-word </unc>
book

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#93:3:A>
All institutions are very similar in terms of the average SSR are
very similar in SSR

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#94:3:A>
And are and in terms of the length the teaching hours uh contact
hour it is within our control

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#95:3:A>
I mean it is the the historical development of Polytechnic that you
have been teaching so many uh say thirty weeks a year as a academic year
whereas as Hong Kong U takes only twenty four weeks

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#96:3:A>
It is not dictated by government

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#97:3:A>
Dictated only by your own institutions

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#98:3:A>
So that  ' s nothing to do with that

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#99:3:A>
We can change it if we want to to say fourteen weeks as academic
year if you want to do it that way

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#100:3:A>
I  ' m just joking

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#101:3:A>
I mean <?> whether </?> thirty or twenty eight or <.> for </.>
twenty four is really up to <.> insti </.> the institute to decide

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#102:3:A>
And also uh for instance leave

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#103:3:A>
University has got uh some kind of uh leave

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#104:3:A>
Hong <.> k </.> <unc> one word </unc> have different type
of leave

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#105:3:A>
Again in the leave arrangements also vary from institutions to
institutions

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#106:3:A>
Again government is not going to dictate on that

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#107:3:A>
So whatever government will dictate will be even for all concern

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#108:3:A>
That is the benefits

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#109:3:A>
Now in terms of criteria <,> originally we thought well it may be
<?> seem </?> just have one common set of criteria applied to all

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#110:3:A>
In <?> further </?> look at in detail it won't work because
different disciplines will have different so called uh <.> aca </.> academic
requirement

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#111:3:A>
And there is also the the question of supply and demand

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#112:3:A>
And because in in some discipline it may not be practicable to
request that PhDs must is is a must if you want to uh to <,> PhD is is is a
fundamental requirement to be a lecturer then you will not be able to find a
single member of staff in some disciplines at all

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#113:3:A>
So I mean discipline has got to be examined more more critically
and and carefully

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#114:3:A>
Now that  ' s why in order to do our job proper we want to set down
some fundamental so called minimum criteria for transfer promotions

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#115:3:A>
Having done that well we look into differences so called
disciplines by their very nature and see whether some should be more more
stringent than others or whether some should be more relaxed than other
depending on on the basic discipline of that subject concerned

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#116:3:A>
And also depends on the kind of uh market and <.> as </.> uh and
<.> as </.> supply are being made available

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#117:3:A>
So we have got to be very careful

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#118:3:A>
That  ' s why we have <.> a </.> as I mention earlier that we are
going through this is the fourth stage of of revision

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#119:3:A>
That  ' s why we have paid so much attention and importance to this
fundamental criteria issues </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-027#120:4:A>
Uhm in terms of salary and other condition of service all
UPTC institutions is only uh subject to one basic guideline where you cannot
find exact comparison

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#121:4:A>
And that guideline is in the generality of provisions we shall not
be better than civil servants

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#122:4:A>
So so in terms of leave now you may say counting the days
Polytechnic staff have a disadvantage

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#123:4:A>
But counting the frequency we definitely are more advantageous
than the university

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#124:4:A>
For example University of Hong Kong <.> i t t </.> the contractual
term or rather the <unc> one-word </unc> are <?> very </?> frequently
longer than Polytechnic

<ICE-HK:S2A-027#125:4:A>
And Polytechnic staff almost every two year will have a a
provision </I>
