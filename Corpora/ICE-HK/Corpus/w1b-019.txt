<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-019#290:17> We write further to our telephone conversation of 15th June
1994 regarding water quality of the captioned premises . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-019#291:17> The concern of water quality of Wisdom Court has been raised by
other residents a few months ago .

<ICE-HK:W1B-019#292:17> We requested the Water Authority and individual laboratory to test
the water .

<ICE-HK:W1B-019#293:17> The reports indicated that though the iron content of the water was
slightly higher , the water was suitable for drinking ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-019#294:17> please see the attached . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-019#295:17> According to the letter of Water Authority , the brownish water
would become clear again after the pipes in the building were flushed for
a<-> shortwhile</-> <+> short while </+> .

<ICE-HK:W1B-019#296:17> The Water Authority further advised the residents to replace the
building  ' s rusty water pipes to improve water quality .

<ICE-HK:W1B-019#297:17> However , after detailed study with our contractor , it was not
feasible to change the water pipes since it would destroy the interior
decoration of all the premises . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-019#298:17> We are now carrying out regular bi-monthly water test and
cleaning of water tanks to monitor/keep the water quality at a satisfactory
level . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-019#299:17> We would advise you to install a water filter to filter the
water should you still worry about the water quality . </p>
