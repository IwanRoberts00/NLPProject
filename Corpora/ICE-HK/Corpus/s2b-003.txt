A call for an early Chinese endorsement of the airport
financing plan

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#2:2:A>
Bill Clinton says it  ' s time to change America

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#3:2:A>
And Ross Perot  ' s departure from the presidential race

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-003#4:2:B>
Good evening

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#5:2:B>
Thanks for joining us

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#6:2:B>
China has been urged to first endorse the financing plans for the
Chek Lap Kok airport itself while efforts to resolve differences over the
airport rail link continue

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#7:2:B>
That  ' s according to the Chief Secretary Sir David Ford today

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#8:2:B>
He led a government briefing aimed at wooing businessmen to invest
in airport core projects

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#9:2:B>
Sir David told the gathering of businessmen that doubts and
uncertainties hampering the airport core program must be removed by reaching
full agreement on all the disputed issues <O> statement by Sir David Ford
</O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#10:2:B>
Sir David noted that Beijing has proposed the sixty eight billion
dollar airport site preparation contract go ahead before a full agreement on
the provisional airport authority  ' s financial plan which involves the
building and running of the Chap Lap Kok airport itself <O> speech by Sir
David Ford </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#11:2:B>
Only that would give international financiers confidence to back
the airport project

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#12:2:B>
So the new British proposal to the airport talks is for Beijing to
agree to the PAA  ' s financing first <O> speech by Sir David Ford </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#13:2:B>
Hard-selling the twenty two billion dollar airport rail link at the
same function was MTR Corporation Chairman Hamish Mathers <O> speech by
Hamish Mathers </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#14:2:B>
And Secretary for the Treasury K Y Yeung tried to allay concerns
over the inflationary impact of the airport core program

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-003#15:2:C>
The entire ACP is likely to end the <?> trend </?> inflation
rate as measured by the by the GDP deflator by little more than half a
percentage point over the medium time

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-003#16:2:B>
Yeung said the ACP  ' s potential inflationary impact on the
building and construction industry is <?> buffered </?> by the special scheme
of importing labour for the ACP

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#17:2:B>
A scheme that  ' s a controversial hot potato in itself

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-003#18:2:A>
The Governor Chris Patten has again called for an early
agreement on the financial arrangements for the airport project <,> <O>

The standby signal number one remains up as tropical
depression Faye moves closer to Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#20:2:B>
It  ' s rather a weak storm and weathermen don't expect to put up
higher typhoon signals

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#X21:2:Z>
One <?> significant </?> change is that uh during this afternoon
<,> there  ' s uh tropical depression slowed down significantly and turned more
to the north

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#X22:2:Z>
Uhm we expect it will move northeast later and according this
forecast track it will pass to Hong Kong  ' s southwest by overnight tonight
and the move towards to coast of Guangdong

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#X23:2:Z>
We will still be affected by the rain bands of Faye <.> to </.>
tonight and tomorrow and the weather will be cloudy with occasional rain

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#X24:2:Z>
But the rain will not be heavy

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#X25:2:Z>
And we expect the weather will become brighter on Sunday </X>

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#26:2:A>
In New York the Democratic National Convention reached its
climax earlier today with a triumphant speech from presidential candidate
Bill Clinton and a political bombshell from the now former candidate Ross
Perot

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#27:2:A>
Perot stunned the supporters by announcing he won't run for
president this fall ending his campaign before it even officially began

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#28:2:A>
In New York delegates reacted to the news with a mixture of joy and
apprehension that the polls now show Clinton clearly out front and the timing
of the announcement couldn't have been better coming just before Clinton  ' s
all important acceptance speech

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#29:2:A>
We  ' ll have more on the speech in a moment

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#30:2:A>
But first Morton Dean of ABC News reports on Perot  ' s withdrawal
<O> footage and report from Morton Dean of ABC News </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#31:2:A>
Perot  ' s announcement dramatically alters the campaign turning it
into a traditional two way race

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#32:2:A>
Both the Clinton and Bush camps are now scrambling to rule Perot  ' s
supporters

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#33:2:A>
The polls taken since the announcement show that Perot  ' s
withdrawal has benefited Clinton the most

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#34:2:A>
An ABC News poll shows Clinton with a two to one lead over Bush

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#35:2:A>
Another poll taken by CNN shows similar results

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#36:2:A>
Analysts are using the word stunning to describe Clinton  ' s lead

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#37:2:A>
But in Wyoming President Bush tried to put the <.> b </.> best face
on Perot  ' s withdrawal saying his supporters will eventually find their way
to the Republican ticket <O> speech by President Bush </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#38:2:A>
Earlier today Clinton delivered what analysts had <?> billed </?>
as the speech of his life

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#39:2:A>
He had to scrambled to make last minute changes calling on Perot  ' s
supporters to come into the Democratic fold

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#40:2:A>

Indian Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao today defeated a no
confidence motion in parliament

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#54:2:B>
The debate was held amid continuing political fallout from a
massive security scandal and the religious dispute over the building of a
Hindu temple in the Northern Town of Ayodhya

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#55:2:B>
The prime minister has ordered troops to Ayodhya where Hindus had
defied a court order to halt construction of a temple

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#56:2:B>
The site is now occupied by a mosque but the Hindus claimed it  ' s
the birthplace of their God King <?> Ramah </?>

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#57:2:B>
Muslims strongly opposed the building of a temple there

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#58:2:B>
The decade old dispute has already led to riots and toppled two
governments

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#59:2:B>
There has been not let up in the violence in Bosnia despite a new

It was one year ago today but the government decided to liquidate
the Bank of Credit and Commerce

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#63:2:B>
Depositors who are still waiting to get back their savings are
gathering in <?> Chade </?> Garden tonight to mark the sad anniversary

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#64:2:B>
Later they plan to march to Government House and hand a petition to
the Governor Chris Patten

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#65:2:B>
About a hundred depositors remembered the anniversary of BCC  ' s
failure with funeral ornaments condemning government officials who had
reassured the public that the bank was secured only to close it down the next
day

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#66:2:B>
A repayment schedule a repayment scheme to fully compensate small
BCC depositors of the hundred thousand dollars or less was announced

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#67:2:B>
But the protestors are not satisfied and are demanding that
everyone who had up to one million dollars in BCC should get all of their
money back

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#68:2:B>
Their petition to the governor calls for an inquiry into the bank
's failure and the events that have taken place since

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#69:2:B>
And Chinese Foreign Minister <?> Chin Chi Zhen </?> made a fleeting

No meetings with the Hong Kong government officials are planned

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-003#75:2:A>
The Governor has had a first hand look at some of the work
done by the police force

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#76:2:A>
Problems at the boarder like illegal immigration and smuggling were
high on his agenda

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#77:2:A>
And he vowed there  ' ll be no slackening of the fight against such
crimes

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#78:2:A>
The governor peeked into Shenzhen from the Man Kam To operational
base one of three bases police at the boarder work out of

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#79:2:A>

Exco members have assured legislators that the Executive
Council <?> didn't </?> seek to preempt this week  ' s motion debate in Legco
on Hong Kong  '  s voting system

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#88:2:B>
Carmen Luk reports

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-003#89:2:D>
At today  ' s Exco in house meeting legislators from the Liberal
camp demanded an explanation on reports that some Exco members had tried to
influence their colleagues before Legco  ' s motion debate on the controversial
multi-seats single vote model

<$E> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-003#90:2:E>
The question is raised whether the voting system was raised at
the Exco meeting on Tuesday

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#91:2:E>
The answer was yes

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-003#92:2:D>
The answer was no to the question whether a member had urged
Exco to make a decision

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#93:2:D>
Selina Chow who is an Exco member denied that a vote was called for
during the meeting

<$F> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-003#94:2:F>
<Indig> Mo uh </indig>

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#95:2:F>
Factually wrong

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-003#96:2:D>
She added that Exco would not make rash decisions on major
policies before Legco motion debates

<$F> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-003#97:2:F>
It should never be uh Exco  ' s <.> r </.> role or position to
preempt Legco

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-003#98:2:D>
Yesterday the Liberal camp in Legco won the debate on Hong
Kong  ' s voting system with the support of independent OMELCO members and
several appointed members

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#99:2:D>
Had Exco made the decision on the issue OMELCO members would have
to stick to that under the rule of collective responsibility

Should Chris Patten wear two hats says the Governor and the
Chairman of the Legislative Council when he attends future Legco future
sessions

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#102:2:B>
That  ' s one of the concerns Legislatives have as the current Legco
session comes to an end

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#103:2:B>
It  ' s been suggested that the governor would like to introduce a
question time in the Council just as the Prime <,> Minister of Britain does
in the House of Lords in House of Commons

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#104:2:B>
After an in house meeting today Deputy Convenor Andrew Wong says
it would be embarrassing for the Governor to wear two hats in the Council

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#105:2:B>
Wong says as Governor Chris Patten would be expected to explain
government policies

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#106:2:B>
But as chairman Wong says Patten would also be expected to hold
the meeting in a fair manner

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#107:2:B>
He suggested that if the question time is introduced the latter  ' s
<?> patent </?> should be amended to allow the Governor to relinquish his
post as Chairman of Legco

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#108:2:B>
But Wong adds the Council members have not yet reached a consensus
on the issue

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#109:2:B>
And Jimmy <{1> <[1> what  ' s on </[1> <{2> <[2> Okay </[2>

<O> translation of Wong  ' s speech </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#115:2:A>
Twenty three year old Wong has been learning about the sport of
badminton since he was twelve

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#116:2:A>
At a sports school in China a coach saw his potential and Wong had
an interest

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#117:2:A>
The rest is history

<ICE-HK:S2B-003#118:2:A>
