Speaking to reporters during a visit to the New Territories Mr
Patten described his meeting with Mr Ma as congenial

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#2:1:A>
He admitted that they did talk about the financial arrangements for
the new airport in general

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#3:1:A>
I asked if he is prepared to see the airport come on <?> stream </?>
after the transfer of power in nineteen ninety-seven

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#4:1:A>
The report says the arrested people were selling some of the
application forms originally priced at one hundred and forty dollars at seven
hundred dollars <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#5:1:A>
And they were also selling the vouchers originally priced at one
thousand four hundred dollars at four thousand eight hundred <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#6:1:A>
Each voucher allows the holder to obtain ten applications forms <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#7:1:A>
The report also says about twenty application forms and about
fifteen vouchers were seized

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#8:1:A>
In a related development Shen Zhen raiders has a total of thirty
three people were injured accidentally and admitted to hospital when they
were queuing for the share application forms or vouchers <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#9:1:A>
The report says the mayor of ShenZhen <?> Cheung Lan Yu </?> has
been visiting the injured and he has <?> said to </?> one of those serious
hurt that he had failed to do his job well and he had made the people
suffered unnecessarily

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#10:1:A>
Mr Patten says he plans to visit the United States after the
elections there to make sure that American opinion is well informed about
efforts to promote democracy in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#11:1:A>
The governor was then asked whether he was in danger of raising the
hopes of the people only to have them bashed at a later stage

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#12:1:A>
<unc> two-words </unc> of ShenZhen say the city has been
calm following the distribution of all vouchers

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#13:1:A>
<?> They can be </?> swamped for application forms for shares

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#14:1:A>
Some people could be seen selling the vouchers at up to three times
the original price at about one thousand five hundred Hong Kong dollars

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#15:1:A>
There weren't that many buyers and no officials were seen in
stopping the resale of the vouchers <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#16:1:A>
The huge crowds <?> that have surged to </?> the city in the last
few days in the frenzy to get application forms for shares have left behind
them in the city great piles of rubbish and train tickets from ShenZhen to
Guangzhou have been grossly inflated </I>

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#17:2:A>
Mr Lee could not confirm that the governor was considering
whether to keep the membership of both councils separate but he said the
proposal would seem to be one way

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#18:2:A>
Mr Patten could avoid facing certain problems such as whether to
appoint more directly elected legislators to ExCo and whether to keep the
rules of confidentiality and collective responsibility for ExCo

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#19:2:A>
He also said the separation of the Legislative and Executive branch
of government was precious elsewhere such as the United States

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#20:2:A>
Nevertheless Mr Lee said the proposal had its drawbacks

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#21:2:A>
He felt the governor might think he could get <unc> two-words
</unc> by devising policies that were right for Hong Kong and had the
support of the general public

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#22:2:A>
This way he could be assured of Legco  ' s backing

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#23:2:A>
He was asked that the proposal would have the disadvantage of
cutting off Legco from the government  ' s decision making process in ExCo

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#24:3:A>
The administration deposited about five hundred million
dollars into the Hong Kong bank account with the exchange fund

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#25:3:A>
The money in the account now stands at one thousand five hundred
million dollars <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#26:3:A>
According to Mr Yam the reason for the hurry injection of money is
because a series of large share issues have absorbed a substantial amount of
investor funds and has led to less money in the <?> interbank </?> market

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#27:3:A>
The banks have therefore <unc> one-word </unc> short term
interest rates in a <unc> two-words </unc> of money

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#28:3:A>
Stronger demand for the Hong Kong dollar has also strengthen the
exchange rate

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#29:3:A>
And banks have seen the need to earn money from a special
government loan arrangement called Liquidity Adjustment Facility although
this charges a relatively high interest rate

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#30:3:A>
Mr Yam said the government would not tried to influence interest
rate levels with an injection of money into the interbank market </I>

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#31:4:A>
Miss Lee said she has asked China to use diplomatic channels
to make representations to Britain over the way the governor went about
changing the membership of the Executive Council which she described as very
impolite and leading to tensions and hurting prosperity and stability in the
territory

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#32:4:A>
She said some ExCo members she knew well told her that Mr Patten
had taken steps to pressure Executive Councillors to resign

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#33:4:A>
In the very attack on the senior Executive Councillor <unc> two
words </unc> Miss Lee says someone had written a letter <?> of </?>
resignation on behalf of ExCo members although some of them had not agreed to
resign

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#34:4:A>
She denied she was inviting China to intervene in Hong Kong  ' s
internal affairs before nineteen ninety-seven

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#35:4:A>
Miss Lee said the governor had frequently made remarks that were
completely out of line

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#36:4:A>
She said Mr Patten  ' s comment on the ShenZhen stock market was a
direct interference in ShenZhen  ' s affairs </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-020#37:5:A>
Mr Lee said setting up a so-called a second stove would make
it difficult to achieve a smooth transition to Chinese sovereignty in
nineteen ninety-seven

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#38:5:A>
He also says such a proposal would undermine the Hong Kong
government

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-020#39:5:B>
Do not do it until you have no way to talk to the British and
and it is as I said it is a a a move that you cannot back off if once you uh
started and it is important for the Chinese government to make that decision
uh

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#40:5:B>
Yet I think the best solution to this political impasse is to
negotiate their way out of it to to have to have a a both countries uh to
discuss a formula that they could agree to and uh and to assure a full train
in nineteen ninety <.> s </.> uh in nineteen ninety-seven

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-020#41:5:A>
Another newly appointed advisor Chan Kai Lam Executive General
of the <?> para- </?> Peking Democratic Alliance for the betterment of Hong
Kong said the group <?> to advice </?> China that the special Committee the
National People  ' s Congress had decided to set up should consist mostly of
people from the territory

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#42:5:A>
He also said its par should not exceed that of the Preparatory
Committee to re-launch in nineteen ninety six under the terms of the Basic
Law

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#43:5:A>
The Preparatory Committee would have formed the first post nineteen
ninety seven government

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#44:5:A>
Also going to Peking for the appointment ceremony was the President
of the Law Society Ambrose Lau

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#45:5:A>
He said he would see if he would eventually ask the Chinese not to
scrap the Bill of Rights as they have threatened to do

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#46:5:A>
However Mr Lau believed the appointment ceremony would not be the
appropriate occasion to broach the subject

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#47:5:A>
The main stories include the student demonstration at the airport
as the Hong Kong <unc> one-word </unc> advisors departed for Peking
and the foreign secretary Douglas Hurd <.> urgi </.> urging Japanese
investors to influence China to maintain free market conditions in Hong Kong
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#48:5:A>
There  ' s a report in the Ming Pao quoting a British source saying
London asked Peking yesterday for a date to launch talks of Hong Kong  ' s
political reform

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#49:5:A>
But the source said Peking has failed to respond so far

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#50:5:A>
The source also said the British side <?> adopted </?> the
sincerity of the British of the Chinese side to resume cooperation and
negotiations <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#51:5:A>
In the editorial several widely circulated papers are concerned
about the foreign secretary  ' s advice to Japanese investors

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#52:5:A>
The editor of the Oriental Daily News is perplexed by Mr Hurd  ' s
remark

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#53:5:A>
He can't understand why Britain is bringing out subtle issues such
as investment protection in its defence of the governor Chris Patten

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#54:5:A>
He says Mr Hurd is now trying to use international forces to
pressure China to yield over Hong Kong issues

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#55:5:A>
The editor says the Sino-British Joint Declaration has already
assured investors their interests in Hong Kong will be protected

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#56:5:A>
The Sing Pao says that the Hurd  ' s remark is a sign of great
distrust of China

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#57:5:A>
The editor says if this attitude remains unchanged the deadlock
over political reform in Hong Kong can be broken up

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#58:5:A>
The paper also points out that the governor  ' s political blueprint
breeches the Joint Declaration the Basic Law and previous diplomatic
understanding between Britain and China

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#59:5:A>
The Tin Tin Daily News is stunned by Mr Hurd  ' s remark

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#60:5:A>
The editor says the foreign secretary  ' s remark is self
contradictory and its reasoning chaotic

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#61:5:A>
The editor says Mr Hurd wants to protect investors on the one hand
but tries to <unc> one-word </unc> support Mr Patten  ' s political
blueprint on the other <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#62:5:A>
But the editor says the governor  ' s reform proposals bring great
changes in <?> the run up </?> to nineteen ninety-seven and this is against
the spirit of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#63:5:A>
<?> However </?> the Ming Pao warns Peking against playing the
economic card against the West

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#64:5:A>
The editor says Peking should avoid the view that economic <.>
recovy </.> recovery in the West depends on its access to the China market

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#65:5:A>
The editor says Peking  ' s new nationalist attitude would only
reinforce fears of China  ' s threat to the world

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#66:5:A>
And as for Chinese papers let  ' s cross over to the <?> Central  ' s
</?> studio for review these papers with Charles <unc> one-word
</unc> </I>

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#67:6:A>
The link is estimated to cost twenty three thousand million
dollars at last year prices

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#68:6:A>
Mr Leung says the public and China will be consulted before the
government decides what proposals to accept and how they will be financed

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#69:6:A>
The proposals have in fact already been handed to the Chinese team
leader of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group but there has been no reaction

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#70:6:A>
He says the government would have to make its decision in a year or
two

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-020#71:6:B>
For the longer term I  ' m I have no reason to believe that
there will be a uh objections about the need for a railway line between Hong
Kong and China particularly for goods traffic and <?> containerization </?>

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#72:6:B>
It is so important for <.> Hon </.> for Hong Kong and for China and
its open door policy

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#73:6:B>
Uh I I thought property is the best selling point

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#74:6:B>
You want to say that  ' s for the China

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#75:6:B>
It is the best for China because if it opens up Kwai Chung to China
from Beijing from <?> Hu Nan </?> from you know from down the central China
straight down south to Kwai Chung container port

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#76:6:B>
This is the best uh way to open up the entire <.> Hon </.> China
hinterland to Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#77:6:B>
So this container line is I think the best and the best investment
in China I think in the next twenty years

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-020#78:6:A>
Mr Leung says this rail link will cut journey times to China
and place Yuen Long within half an hour travelling time <?> from </?> Central

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#79:6:A>
He also says Tuen <?> Mun </?> would be about three quarters of an
hour from Central as a result </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-020#80:7:A>
is being concern to the proposed Special Committee maybe
involved in <?> writing </?> contracts franchises and land grants which are
effective beyond nineteen ninety-seven <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#81:7:A>
The group would then become a second power center well before
nineteen ninety six

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#82:7:A>
When the Preparatory Committee with similar functions to be set up
under the terms of the Basic Law

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#83:7:A>
Chinese sources have recently spoken to the press to allay fears
that the Special Committee  ' s terms of reference will be so wide <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#84:7:A>
But now it appears Peking may expand the <?> Preparatory </?>
Committee  ' s <?> pass </?> if Britain presses ahead with the governor  ' s
political reform proposals

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#85:7:A>
Speaking in Peking the head of the local branch of the New China
News Agency <?> Chou Nan </?> reiterated that the standing committee or the
National People  ' s Congress would set up the group if the Congress approves
its formation later today </I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-020#86:8:A>
The report <?> signs </?> one case of the head of the head of
<?> in syndicate </?> in Singapore was <?> launched </?> at sixty million
Hong Kong dollars over a period of <unc> one word </unc> a year
through Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#87:8:A>
The FBI has also learned triads are continuing to send huge amounts
of money to banks in San Francisco <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#88:8:A>
In addition the immigration officials have noted the huge number of
illegal immigrants from Hong Kong who have been surging into Los Angeles over
the past few years

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#89:8:A>
The authorities believe many of the <unc> two words </unc>
are triad members

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#90:8:A>
The study says there are more than thirteen triad societies now
operating in the United States

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#91:8:A>
The most active groups are the Fourteen K and the Sun Yi On who are
running illegal activities in more than six US cities

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#92:8:A>
The report says the triads have now joined up with other criminal
syndicates in the United States and Canada <?> for </?> business ventures
including bringing Asian entertainers to the United States </I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-020#93:9:A>
Most of the main papers lead to the appointment of a second
batch of Hong Kong advisors to China or the elections of China  ' s vice
premiers

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#94:9:A>
But the pro-Taiwan United Daily leads with an interview with
executive councillor Professor Eric Chan

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#95:9:A>
He says the government has been discussing contingency plans for
the worse case scenario of no cooperation with China in the <?> run </?> up
to nineteen ninety-seven

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#96:9:A>
He also says China may <?> expel </?> all politicians and officials
when it takes over but it plans for the people of Hong Kong to know this will
be the case

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#97:9:A>
Professor Chan also says the worse case scenario includes building
the new airport without China  ' s cooperation

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#98:9:A>
But the project will be hopeless even then because Hong Kong has
<?> huge </?> reserves and the exchange fund

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#99:9:A>
In the editorials the China controlled Tai Kung Pao says the road
of Hong Kong advisors will become more important if London refuses to
cooperate with Peking

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#100:9:A>
Peking then decides instead of Hong Kong  ' s post nineteen ninety
seven political system in its own way and China lives up to Lu <?> Ping  ' s
</?> promise to consult a wide spectrum of Hong Kong people on how this can
be done

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#101:9:A>
<,> Although <.> mo </.> most of the main papers have failed to
stand <?> four square </?> behind the governor  ' s political reform proposals
they are united in opposing Peking  ' s decision to exclude pro-democracy
representatives from the second batch of Hong Kong advisors

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#102:9:A>
The <?> mass circulation </?> Oriental Daily News says it  ' s
impossible to ignore the presence and the influence of the pro-democracy
groups

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#103:9:A>
But the paper says if the Hong Kong advisors hold on to the
principle of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong then they should be able to
set a practical influence on Peking  ' s policies on the territory

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#104:9:A>
The Sing Pao expresses the hope that China will understand that
listening to a wide spectrum of views will lead to insights

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#105:9:A>
The editor calls on Peking to consider different views as far as
possible

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#106:9:A>
But at the same breath he also attacks the media for labeling
pro-China groups as anti-democracy

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#107:9:A>
And finally the Tin Tin Daily News says it  ' s not surprising there
aren't pro-democracy people in the second batch of Hong Kong advisors

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#108:9:A>
What was odd is the absence of <?> grass root </?> representatives
as well

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#109:9:A>
The paper says people who hold different political views from
those of Peking can still love their country and their own <.> ra </.> race
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#110:9:A>
The editorial says if someone <?> supports </?> to sign the
British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law he should be eligible for a
possible <.> ap </.> appointment as a Hong Kong advisor

<ICE-HK:S2B-020#111:9:A>
And as for Chinese papers let  ' s cross over to the <?> Central  ' s
</?> studio for <?> review of </?> these newspapers with Charles <unc>
one-word </unc> </I>
