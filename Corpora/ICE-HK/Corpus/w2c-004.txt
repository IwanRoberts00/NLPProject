<bold> Watchmaker faces Thai piracy battle </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-004#2:1>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#3:1>
A SWISS sports watch company is fighting hard against the same
problem in Thailand as Hongkong watchmakers are battling in China &dash;
counterfeiting . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#4:1>
Tag Heuer is cranking up measures against counterfeiters after the
April discovery in Bangkok of 3,000 watches and 6,000 bracelets imitating its
logo and design . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#5:1>
And as the group hopes to clinch a deal within two weeks with a
leading Swiss watch distributor in China , the lessons it has learned should
come in handy there . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#6:1>
Sales manager Hansruedi Imboden said the hardest task was
directing consumers from imitation watches , as their liking for fakes was
the greatest stumbling block in the battle . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#7:1>
&ldquo; The consumers somehow can tell the difference between
counterfeit and real watches ... but many tourists buy them &obrack; fake
watches &cbrack; as a joke or small gift for friends, &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#8:1>
The low price &dash; sometimes as low as US&dollar;10 &dash; of a
fake Tag Heuer watch was an attraction , he added , as was their improving
quality . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#9:1>
The company was using advertising to try to turn consumer opinion
in favour of genuine watches , said Mr Imboden . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#10:1>
But the most important thing was to track down producers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#11:1>
Counterfeiters were widespread in Thailand as regulations against
them were not properly implemented , said Mr Imboden . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#12:1>
However , Mr Imboden thought that on the mainland , Tag Heuer
would not encounter a serious problem with counterfeits immediately because
its name had to be established in the country before imitators would be
interested . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#13:1>
Meanwhile , Hongkong Seibu watch salesman Samuel Tsang Kwok-kit
said political factors had hit sales . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#14:1>
&ldquo; Watch sales have been slightly dragged down by the
Sino-British row, &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#15:1>
&ldquo; And the influence of the Tiananmen Square crackdown still
lingers .

<ICE-HK:W2C-004#16:1>
Although sales have been fast recovering in recent years , they are
still a bit lower than during the heyday before 1989 . &rdquo; </p> </I>

<bold> Electronics firm buys Central floor </bold> </h> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#19:2>
NATIONAL Electronics Holdings has agreed to buy the 29th floor of
Nine Queen  ' s Road Central from Innsbruck Co for &dollar;122.23 million .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#20:2>
The move comes just a day after National Electronics said it
would dispose of Banyan Villas for &dollar;210 million . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#21:2>
It said yesterday that the Queen  ' s Road deal would be financed
partly from the company  ' s resources and partly by bank borrowings . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#22:2>
&ldquo; The directors of the company are of the opinion that this
will not have any material adverse effect on the company  ' s cash flow or
gearing position, &rdquo; it said in a statement . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#23:2>
An initial deposit of &dollar;12.22 million was paid on Tuesday
when a preliminary agreement was signed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#24:2>
A further payment of &dollar;24.44 million is due upon the
signing of the transaction agreement next Tuesday .

<ICE-HK:W2C-004#25:2>
The balance will be paid by the end of the month . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#26:2>
The property , with a net floor area of 10,456 square feet , is
now leased to a party independent of National Electronics . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#27:2>
The two leases involved , to expire respectively in March 2013
and March 2032 , yield an aggregate monthly rental of &dollar;454,010 ,
exclusive of rates and management fees . </p>

<p> In similar deals with the same transaction closing date , Innsbruck sold
the 26th , 28th and 30th floors of the building , a 34-storey office tower
which was completed in 1991 . </p> </I>

<bold> Lai to quit Giordano board Beijing closes store over attack on
Li Peng </bold> </h> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#30:3>
OUTSPOKEN Hong Kong entrepreneur Jimmy Lai Chee-ying is expected
to resign as chairman and director of Giordano Holdings &ldquo; in the near
future &rdquo; to save the garment retailer from Beijing-inflicted troubles ,
according to sources . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#31:3>
China  ' s Foreign Trade and Economic Commission ordered the
closure late yesterday of Giordano  ' s month-old Beijing clothing shop on
Wangfujiang Street , saying the shop had not completed its retail licensing
documentation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#32:3>
&ldquo; We will try to complete the licensing papers within the
next couple of weeks, &rdquo; a Giordano spokesman said yesterday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#33:3>
Sources said the Foreign Trade and Economic Commission had
ordered its Guangdong branch to tighten scrutiny of the Giordano outlets in
the province . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#34:3>
Analysts attributed Beijing  ' s move to a recent article in Mr Lai  ' s
<it> Next Magazine </it> , which is believed to have upset the mainland
Government .

<ICE-HK:W2C-004#35:3>
The controversial magazine has 200 staff and a circulation of 180,000 .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#36:3>
Mr Lai started <it> Next Magazine </it> , an outspoken weekly ,
in 1991 , two years after the Tiananmen Square bloodbath .

<ICE-HK:W2C-004#37:3>
His decision was triggered partly by his disapproval of the military
crackdown on the democratic movement . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#38:3>
The critical piece , written by Mr Lai , appeared in an edition
of the weekly last month . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#39:3>
In the article , in the form of an open letter to Chinese Premier
Li Peng , Mr Lai condemned the mainland official , who played a key role in
the Beijing massacre , using abusive language . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#40:3>
&ldquo; A public letter to <it> <indig> wong bak dan </indig>
</it> &obrack; a rude expression meaning a stupid and bad person &cbrack; Li
Peng, &rdquo; read the headline . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#41:3>
&ldquo; Li Peng , you are a shame on the country . No , you are
&obrack; in fact &cbrack; a super shame on the country, &rdquo; the article  ' s
opening paragraph read . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#42:3>
&ldquo; To have this <it> <indig> wong bak dan </indig> </it>
like you among Chinese who have a civilisation of 5,000 years is something
sad for us . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#43:3>
&ldquo; In the past 40 years , the Communist Party has done China
the greatest harm , causing a decline in the country  ' s moral standards .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#44:3>
&ldquo; Not only are you a <it> <indig> wong bak dan </indig>
</it> , but you are also a <it> <indig> wong bak dan </indig> </it> with zero
IQ, &rdquo; it said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#45:3>
The article concludes with the remark : &ldquo; Goodbye . Wish
you <it> <indig> pook gai </indig> </it> &obrack; a curse &cbrack; , &rdquo;
which literally means &ldquo; drop dead &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#46:3>
Mr Lai heads Giordano and is the controlling shareholder .

<ICE-HK:W2C-004#47:3>
The clothing store chain is the 106th largest company listed on the
territory  ' s stock exchange , with a market capitalisation of &dollar;2.99
billion . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#48:3>
The group thrives in seven markets around the region , operating
35 stores in China , 37 in Hong Kong and 174 in Taiwan . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#49:3>
For the year ending December 31 , Giordano recorded net profits
of &dollar;137.6 million , compared with &dollar;115 million in 1992 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#50:3>
In the first half of this year net profit rose 58 per cent to
&dollar;85 million . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2C-004#51:3>
Mr Lai  ' s Next Group &dash; which owns <it> Next Magazine </it> ,
<it> Easy Finder </it> and <it> Racing World </it> &dash; is planning to seek
a stock market listing in March . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#52:3>
Mr Lai has said that while the group will adjust its editorial
policy , it will not &ldquo; kowtow to get business going &rdquo; . </p> </I>

<bold> Top Glory workers accuse National Mutual of vendetta </bold>
</h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-004#54:4>
<bold> By CARRIE LEE </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#55:4>
SOME of the Top Glory Insurance Co employees subjected to a
police search last Wednesday say the raid was a vendetta against them by
National Mutual Insurance Co , their former employer . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#56:4>
&ldquo; I think National Mutual just wants to harass us, &rdquo;
said one of the 10 Top Glory employees whose offices and homes were searched
by the Commercial Crime Bureau &obrack; CCB &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#57:4>
&ldquo; I think some people just want to make trouble, &rdquo;
said another . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#58:4>
&ldquo; That will affect people  ' s confidence in the insurance
industry . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#59:4>
But National Mutual chairman and president Sir David Akers-Jones
yesterday denied the company initiated the CCB search by filing a complaint
with the police . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#60:4>
Of the comments made by former National Mutual employees , he
said : &ldquo; There is absolutely no foundation for that story &obrack; that
the police raid was a vendetta by National Mutual &cbrack; . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#61:4>
Top Glory has lured a considerable number of employees from
National Mutual and the move has affected National Mutual  ' s business . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#62:4>
Meanwhile , more details of the documents taken from Seapower
International Holdings  '  managing director Francis Yuen Tin-fan during raids
on his home and offices have been disclosed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#63:4>
The police took six documents from his home . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#64:4>
They were : &bullet; Management meeting minutes . &bullet; The
draft of an announcement on Seapower International Holdings appointing a
managing director and the placing of shares . &bullet; Two drafts on the
proposed acquisition by Mr Yuen and Peregrine of an interest in Seapower
International Holdings . &bullet; Two drafts of profit-loss accounts . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#65:4>
&ldquo; It so happened that they were all the documents of
Seapower I had at home, &rdquo; said Mr Yuen . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#66:4>
&ldquo; I don't know how on earth they would ever be relevant to
the takeover plan on National Mutual &obrack; mentioned in the search warrant
&cbrack; , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#67:4>
&ldquo; Most of the stuff in the documents has already been
announced &obrack; publicly &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2C-004#68:4>
Actually I can make them available to whichever member of the press
wants them, &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#69:4>
The police also took documents from Mr Yuen  ' s office , the
offices of Seapower International and Seapower Resources and their subsidiary
, Seapower Financial Services . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#70:4>
&ldquo; We had some files on Top Glory ... We had some
information on insurance companies including National Mutual ... such as
public information &dash; annual reports and brokers  '  reports on National
Mutual .

<ICE-HK:W2C-004#71:4>
We gave them all to the police, &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#72:4>
Mr Yuen said he had received a letter from Seapower  ' s lawyer ,
Richards Butler , stating the documents taken from the company by the police
contained no evidence of a criminal conspiracy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#73:4>
No documents or material were taken away by the police from the
offices and homes of Top Glory employees as a result of the search . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#74:4>
National Mutual employees were also among those searched last
Wednesday .

<ICE-HK:W2C-004#75:4>
They were Louis Shum Wang-chin , Paul Ng Wing-keung and Peter Chan
Wai-keung . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#76:4>
Another former National Mutual employee , Norman Koo Hai-ching ,
was searched , even though he does not work for Top Glory . </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#80:5>
LAWYERS for Seapower International Holdings managing director
Francis Yuen Tin-fan have written to confirm documents taken from the company
contain no evidence of criminal conspiracy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#81:5>
Mr Yuen said yesterday that neither he nor the company were
involved in an alleged plan to take over the National Mutual insurance Co .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#82:5>
Speaking from his Alexandra House office in Central , which was
raided by police last Wednesday , Mr Yuen confirmed that some documents had
been taken away by Commercial Crime Bureau &obrack; CCB &cbrack; officers .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#83:5>
Mr Yuen , who is a former chief executive of the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange , said documents were taken from both his office and his home . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#84:5>
He said the company  ' s lawyers , Richards Butler , who were
present during the search and read all the documents taken away , said in a
letter to Mr Yuen : &ldquo; In our view , no evidence of &lsquo; criminal
conspiracy &rsquo; was uncovered by the CCB today &obrack; last Wednesday
&cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2C-004#85:5>
The few documents removed by the CCB from Seapower were irrelevant .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#86:5>
&ldquo; We have already spoken with the police about the alleged
theft of papers from National Mutual premises and with the Computer Crime
Section of the CCB with regard to alleged theft of computer programmes by Top
Glory staff . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#87:5>
&ldquo; Both these investigations failed to uncover any evidence
of wrongdoing , and have , we hope , been dropped . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#88:5>
Mr Yuen confirmed the company co-operated with the police . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#89:5>
&ldquo; They were quite polite .

<ICE-HK:W2C-004#90:5>
The research was professionally handled .

<ICE-HK:W2C-004#91:5>
I don't have complaints, &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#92:5>
Mr Yuen found himself named as a key figure in a controversy
involving an alleged takeover of National Mutual earlier in the year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#93:5>
At the time , his company was named along with Top Glory as being
interested in encouraging National Mutual agents to join a new insurance
venture . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#94:5>
Some Top Glory employees , previously employed by National Mutual
, also had their offices and homes raided by police last week , although no
documents were taken . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#95:5>
Mr Yuen said the CCB , when it searched his office and home , did
not explain to him what he was suspected of committing : &ldquo; The search
warrant just said they needed information in relation to a takeover plan on
National Mutual . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#96:5>
Mr Yuen said he knew nothing about a takeover plan . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#97:5>
&ldquo; Neither Seapower nor I have ever thought of taking over
National Mutual .

<ICE-HK:W2C-004#98:5>
I have no idea how we can be related to the takeover plan, &rdquo; he
said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#99:5>
He added the size of National Mutual , with about &dollar;7
billion to &dollar;8 billion in assets , would not be an easy takeover target .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#100:5>
&ldquo; If you say Seapower International wants to take it over
, I can tell you we  ' re not qualified, &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#101:5>
&ldquo; I just gave them whatever they wanted, &rdquo; he added .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#102:5>
He would not comment on speculation that the police action
stemmed from complaints from National Mutual . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#103:5>
&ldquo; I don't know .

<ICE-HK:W2C-004#104:5>
Apart from knowing from the search warrant that it needs information
relating to a takeover plan on National Mutual.

<ICE-HK:W2C-004#105:5>
I don't know what that takeover plan was, &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#106:5>
National Mutual announced net profit rose 48.8 per cent to
&dollar;353 million and there was a 20 per cent jump in total premium income
to &dollar;1.88 billion for the six months ended March 31 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#107:5>
There was a &dollar;30 million exceptional item in the company  ' s
accounts representing spending on financial incentives to retain employees ,
public relations costs , consultancy costs and legal fees . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#108:5>
There was no estimate of lost sales . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#109:5>
Top Glory Insurance Co &obrack; Bermuda &cbrack; and its
executive vice-chairman Andrew Yang said at the weekend they were innocent of
any wrongdoing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#110:5>
National Mutual chairman and president Sir David Akers-Jones
also distanced himself and his company from the police investigations . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#111:5>
&ldquo; We have not been approached by the Commercial Crime
Bureau, &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#112:5>
John Snelgrove , of National Mutual , said : &ldquo; We don't
believe or expect the CCB to approach us to help with the investigations .

RESTLESS employees who cannot resist jumping ship whenever the
mood takes them are sabotaging China  ' s march towards a market economy ,
according to enterprise leaders . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#118:6>
Bosses are being forced to come up with increasingly attractive
employment packages to lure quality staff , who then have to be kept
motivated with rewards and enticements . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#119:6>
The new economic regime , which means the survival of only the
fittest enterprises , has created high demand for the skilled and talented .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#120:6>
&ldquo; A lot of people jump ship , especially in the middle of
the year when staff get their yearly bonus, &rdquo; said Chen Caiying ,
promotions officer at the Yirong Group , a leading polyester plant in Shengze
, a bustling township in Suzhou city . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#121:6>
&ldquo; Staff turnover is high &dash; to retain employees , the
group has been raising wages and signing contracts with technicians . &rdquo;
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#122:6>
Chen Yongming , office director Shengze Printing and Dyeing Mill
, also a leading Shengze polyester plant , said that job-hopping was common
in the polyester industry in the township . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#123:6>
&ldquo; Some employees previously at state enterprises have
joined us as we offer better pay , for instance, &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#124:6>
Strong rivalry exists between the two companies , but Shengze
Printing appears to be more aggressive in the cut-throat quest for talent .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#125:6>
It uses the obvious weapon of high pay incentives .

<ICE-HK:W2C-004#126:6>
Workers at the enterprise earn an average annual salary of 10,000
yuan &obrack; about HK&dollar;89,690 &cbrack; , against 8,000 yuan at Yirong .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#127:6>
&ldquo; Our wages bill has grown fast , with last year  ' s
average being 8,000 yuan , compared with the average in the township of 3,000
yuan, &rdquo; Mr Chen said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#128:6>
&ldquo; An engineer here earns about 700 yuan a month , with an
additional annual bonus of about 2,000 yuan . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#129:6>
Apart from high wages , Shengze Printing also offers fringe
benefits and training in a bid to lure and retain quality staff . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#130:6>
&ldquo; Every newly recruited employee of the engineer grade or
above is offered a 200,000 yuan villa instantly , and a 100,000 yuan gratuity
upon completion of the five-year contract, &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#131:6>
Living quarters were provided for even the lowest-grade
employees once they had served more than three years . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#132:6>
Each unit was at least 645 square feet , compared with the
average living area in Suzhou of 537 sq ft per household . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-004#133:6>
&ldquo; Starting next year , the company will give every staff
member a gift every day .

<ICE-HK:W2C-004#134:6>
It can be a drink , a banana ... it depends, &rdquo; Mr Chen said .
