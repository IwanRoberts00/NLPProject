<ICE-HK:S2A-063#1:1:A>
Members of the jury it  ' s now for me to sum up the this case to
you <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#2:1:A>
This means that I will tell you what is the law to be applied to
this case <,> and draw your attention to some salient features of the
evidence which I hope it may assist you in your deliberation <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#3:1:A>
It is a sad case <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#4:1:A>
All cases involving death are <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#5:1:A>
And you will keep out from your mind any prejudice or sympathy <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#6:1:A>
You will not allow your emotion to influence your decision <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#7:1:A>
Each of you have taken oath to try this case and return a verdict
according to the evidence <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#8:1:A>
The time has now come for all of you to honour your obligation <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#9:1:A>
The evidence in the context of this case is all the testimony given
in the witness box <,> the admitted facts the exhibits <,> and witnesses who
are not called to testify in the witness box <,> but whose statements were
read out to you as a result of agreement between the prosecution and the
defence <,> such as the statement of Dr Li William Chai the forensic
pathologist <,> and Superintendent Keenan <,> who conducted the two
identification parades <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#10:1:A>
Anything else is not evidence <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#11:1:A>
And you will completely disregard matters which might have come to
your knowledge outside this courtroom <,> or through the news media <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#12:1:A>
You have just heard speeches from Mr Young for the prosecution <,>
Mr Nguyen for the defence <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#13:1:A>
You will give very careful considerations to what they have told
you <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#14:1:A>
However I must caution you <,> that counsel  ' s speech is not
evidence <,> and you are not obliged to act on it unless you agree with what
they have said <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#15:1:A>
And you will not hesitate to reject anything <,> that you will find
to have no merit or substance <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#16:1:A>
By the same token <,> what Mr Young told you in his opening speech
is not evidence <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#17:1:A>
It is merely an outline of what the prosecution was expecting to
prove during this trial <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#18:1:A>
For instance Mr Young told you <,> that he would call three
eye-witnesses <,> but as a matter of fact only two eye-witnesses were called
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#19:1:A>
Mr Young was <?> right </?> you would not speculate or guess what
the third uh witness might or might not say <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#20:1:A>
He has not uh given evidence so there  ' s no evidence coming from
you <,> from him <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#21:1:A>
I will now say a few words about my responsibility and your
responsibility <,> and that  ' s our respective function in this trial <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#22:1:A>
It is my function to direct you as to the law <,> and that is to
say to tell you what the law is <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#23:1:A>
You must accept what I tell you with regard to the law as being
correct and apply it to the facts which you will find to have been
established <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#24:1:A>
The facts are completely different

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#25:1:A>
In total contrast to my role as the judge of law <,> you are the
judge the sole judge of facts <,> both individually and collectively <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#26:1:A>
It  ' s for you to decide what evidence you will accept <,> and what
evidence <,> you will reject <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#27:1:A>
It  ' s also for you to decide what inferences or conclusions you
would draw from the established facts <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#28:1:A>
That you must not <?> speculate </?> you must not guess <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#29:1:A>
Ultimately it will be you and no one else <,> who will decide
whether each defendant is guilty or not guilty <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#30:1:A>
If I happen to express any views on the evidence <,> of which have
no appeal to you <,> it is your duty to reject them <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#31:1:A>
On the other hand if I omit to mention evidence which you think is
important you must take it into consideration just as if I stress evidence
that you think unimportant you must ignore it <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#32:1:A>
You are perfectly entitled to accept to reject either in whole or
in part the evidence of any witness

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#33:1:A>
<,> If you come to the conclusion <,> that part of the evidence of
a witness is true and part is untrue <,> you will accept the part you believe
to be true and reject the part <,> that you believe to be untrue <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#34:1:A>
<?> In </?> deciding whether each defendant is guilty or not guilty
<,> you will apply your combined common sense and experience in life <,> as
intelligent and reasonable men and women of the world <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#35:1:A>
It is a cardinal principle of our criminal law in Hong Kong <,>
that a person is presumed to be innocent <,> until he or she is proved guilty
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#36:1:A>
The burden is on the prosecution <,> to prove each defendant is
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#37:1:A>
And that is to say the prosecution must satisfy you on the evidence
<,> so that you can be sure <,> of the guilt of each defendant <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#38:1:A>
<?> Though the </?> two defendants are charged and tried together
<,> you must consider the case against and for each defendant separately <,>
and return a separate verdict in respect of each <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#39:1:A>
The fact you may find one defendant guilty does not mean that the
other defendant is also guilty <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#40:1:A>
Vice versa <,> if you find one of them not guilty <,> it does not
mean that you have to find the other <,> defendant guilty not guilty <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#41:1:A>
The two defendants did not give evidence in the witness box <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#42:1:A>
They are not obliged to give evidence <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#43:1:A>
They are entitled to to sit back in the dock <,> and require the
prosecution to prove the case against them <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#44:1:A>
You must not assume each defendant is guilty because he has not <?>
given </?> evidence <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#45:1:A>
Each defendant has raised the defence of alibi and has called
witnesses to testify on their behalf <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#46:1:A>
I will deal with this aspect of their case at a later stage <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#47:1:A>
Right now I would like to ask you to look at that indictment <,>
which uh is in front of you <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#48:1:A>
This is a document which sets out the offence for which the two
defendants are charged <,> and the particulars of that offence <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#49:1:A>
A defendant is also referred to as the accused in a criminal trial
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#50:1:A>
And there  ' s no uh a distinction nor any difference between these
two words

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#51:1:A>
The two defendants are Vietnamese boat people <,> at the time of
this incident

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#52:1:A>
At the time of this incident took place both of them were inmates
of the Whitehead Detention Center in section number three <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#53:1:A>
They are charged with murder of another inmate and the particulars
of the offence are these <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#54:1:A>
Vu Dac Hong and Bui Hui Thuyet on the thirty-first day of October
nineteen ninety-one inside Section three Whitehead Detention Center Shatin
New Territories Hong Kong <,> murdered Hoang Minh-tuyen <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#55:1:A>
What is murder <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#56:1:A>
It is the unlawful killing of one person by another person with
intent either to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#57:1:A>
Unlawful means without legal justification or excuse <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#58:1:A>
Grievous bodily harm is simply serious bodily injury <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#59:1:A>
It is important that you do not confuse intent with motive <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#60:1:A>
Intention to kill or to cause serious bodily injury </I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-063#61:2:A>
Members of the jury the time has now come for me to sum up
this case to you <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#62:2:A>
In about an hour  ' s time <,> I will ask you to retire to <?>
consider your verdicts </?> <,,> and that is to decide whether the accused
are guilty or not guilty <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#63:2:A>
In the course of my summing up <,> I will endeavour to tell you
what is the law to be applied to this case <,> and to draw your attention to
some salient features of the evidence which I hope <,> may assist you in your
deliberation <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#64:2:A>
You have already heard speeches from counsel <,> both for the
prosecution and for the defence <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#65:2:A>
You will give very careful consideration to what they have said to
you <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#66:2:A>
However I must tell you <,> what counsel said in their speeches is
not evidence <,,> and is not binding on you <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#67:2:A>
You only take into account matters <,> if you agree with them <,,>
and must not hesitate hesitate to reject anything that that you uh do not
agree <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#68:2:A>
It your oath requires you to try this case <,> and to return your
verdicts strictly according to the evidence <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#69:2:A>
In the present case <,> evidence consists of all the oral testimony
<,> given in the witness box <,> the uh admitted facts <,> and the uh
exhibits <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#70:2:A>
That is the evidence in this case <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#71:2:A>
You will completely ignore anything that might have come to your
knowledge from other sources <,> such as reading newspaper reports <,>
because that is not evidence <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#72:2:A>
The uh charges <,> which these accused face are certainly
unpleasant and distasteful offences <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#73:2:A>
They involved two young girls of just over thirteen and fourteen
respectively <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#74:2:A>
But members of the jury <,> you are not here to judge the moral
character <,> or moral standard of these individuals <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#75:2:A>
Your function is to decide whether the accused <,> have committed
the offences <,> and you will decide this issue strictly on the evidence <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#76:2:A>
You will keep out of your mind any bias prejudice against the
accused <,> or any sympathy for the uh two young girls <,> and their families
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#77:2:A>
Emotion has no place to play has no place in our criminal justice
system <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#78:2:A>
The law protects the innocent <,> and punishes the guilty <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#79:2:A>
It  ' s important at this stage for me to say a few words <,> to you
about my responsibility <,> and your responsibility and that is our
respective functions in this trial <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#80:2:A>
It  ' s my duty to tell you what the law is <,> and how to apply it
to the issues of fact <,> that you have to decide <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#81:2:A>
You must accept what I tell you about the law as being correct <,>
and apply it to the facts which you find to have been established <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#82:2:A>
But the facts are different

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#83:2:A>
In total contrast to my role as the judge of law <,> you are the
judge and the sole judge of facts <,> both individually and collectively as a
jury <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#84:2:A>
<?> It is for </?> you to decide what evidence you accept <,> and
what evidence you will reject <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#85:2:A>
It  ' s also for you to decide what inferences <,> or conclusions <,>
you will draw from the established facts <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#86:2:A>
To draw inferences is to make logical deductions <,> from
established facts <,> but you must not <.> spec <.> speculate <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#87:2:A>
Speculation is guessing <,> and you must not guess <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#88:2:A>
You must not guess what uh uh might have or might not have happened
on the dates in question <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#89:2:A>
You can only decide uh <,> the issues that are before you on the uh
facts on the evidence <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#90:2:A>
Ultimately members of jury it  ' s you and you alone who will decide
whether the accused or any of them <,> are guilty or not guilty <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#91:2:A>
In the discharge of your important responsibility <,> you will
apply to combine common sense and experience in life as mature <,> informed
and responsible members of the community <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#92:2:A>
You will take a broad view of the evidence <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#93:2:A>
You are perfectly entitled to accept everything a witness says <,>
or reject everything <,> because you are the judge of facts <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#94:2:A>
You may also accept part of the evidence of a witness <,> and
reject the other part or parts <,> if you believe part of the evidence is
true <,> and the rest is untrue <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#95:2:A>
This is only common sense <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#96:2:A>
From time to time during my summing up <,> I may express views on
the evidence or on the facts <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#97:2:A>
It  ' s your duty to reject them <,> unless you agree with the views
I express because in that case they will become your views <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#98:2:A>
For the same reason if I mention or emphasize evidence that you
consider unimportant <,> you will ignore that evidence <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#99:2:A>
On the other hand if I do not mention the evidence <,> that you uh
regard as important you will take that evidence into account <,> in the
course of your deliberation <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#100:2:A>
It is a cardinal principle of the criminal law in Hong Kong <,>
that a person is presumed innocent until he or she is proved guilty <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#101:2:A>
The prosecution must prove the accused  ' s guilt <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#102:2:A>
An accused does not have to prove his innocence <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#103:2:A>
Before you can convict any accused <,> you must be sure of his
guilt <,> and that is the same thing as being satisfied beyond reasonable
doubt of his guilt <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#104:2:A>
You have in front of you a copy of the indictment <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#105:2:A>
This is the document setting out the offences <?> with </?> which
the accused are charged and the particulars of those offences <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#106:2:A>
At the outset there were a total of five accused <,> and you
recall that midway through the trial I discharged you from returning any
verdict in respect of Lai Ngai Sze and Fung Pik Han the two female accused
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#107:2:A>
This effectively leaves only the three male accused on the
indictment <,> and Lai Ngai Sze the fourth accused and Fung Pik Han the fifth
accused are now out of the picture and no longer your concern <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#108:2:A>
You will also recall as a result of concessions made by Mr Lavac
<,> counsel of prosecution and on my direction <,> you returned formal
verdicts of not guilty on counts one two three and four <,,> against Lit
Chung Pui the third accused which means that he is not facing these charges

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#109:2:A>
The indictment as now stands has three accused and twelve counts
<,,> and that each count has one uh accused or defendant

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#110:2:A>
As there are three accused and a multiplicity of counts <,> you
must consider each count separately and the case against each <,> and for
each accused separately <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#111:2:A>
You will return a separate verdict <?> on </?> each count <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#112:2:A>
The fact that you find one accused guilty <,> does not mean that
the other accused must also be guilty and vice versa <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-063#113:2:A>
Similarly the fact that you find one accused guilty on one count
it does mean that he must also be guilty on the other counts <,> and of
course vice versa </I>
