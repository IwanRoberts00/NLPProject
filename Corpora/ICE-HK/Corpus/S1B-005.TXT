<ICE-HK:S1B-005#1:1:A>
Now in the previous lectures alright <,> now we have study that
we can use an <unc> one-word </unc> system to measure a different
physical variables alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#2:1:A>
And <,> there are many different types of instrument in which we can
measure the different types of variables and although the variables if we try
to measure might differ in forms like a we like that will be measure
temperature alright flow rate or even Ph value or something

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#3:1:A>
Now we can always try to <,> <?> represent </?> the <?>
instrumentation </?> system by means of block diagrams by means of functional
blocks alright and that the cynical instrumental system may consists of the
transducer the signal condition unit the transition path and the display and
we call it devices

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#4:1:A>
Now how far if you are given different types of instruments to
measure different physical variable

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#5:1:A>
Uh say for example if you try to measure temperature alright now we
might have different types of measurement devices like say a resistance
thermometer alright or might be a mercury if you ask thermometer and so on

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#6:1:A>
Now so for the same types of instrument how are we going to decide
which one would be better to use

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#7:1:A>
There will be certain criteria with image we can judge whether one
instrument system is better than the other instrumental system

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#8:1:A>
Now so in order to be able to arrive such a decision now we would
need to understand what we call the performance characteristic of instruments
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#9:1:A>
And basically we can classify the performance characteristic into
what we call the static characteristic and later on you will discuss the
dynamic characteristic

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#10:1:A>
Now if state characteristic can be used to compare the performance
of different instrument under what we call a static condition that means the
input do not vary with static time alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#11:1:A>
Now so normally if you try to evaluate the characteristic of the
instrument <.> un </.> under static condition <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#12:1:A>
The first one that we will look at is what we call the static
sensitivity

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#13:1:A>
Now in static sensitivity can be defined as the change in output
for a different unit change in input <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#14:1:A>
Now typically if you try to consider the <unc> one-word
</unc> curve of instrument alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#15:1:A>
Suppose it is the input <,,> and suppose that is the output okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#16:1:A>
So typically if we try to evaluate the performance of instrument
you will need to have a relationship between an input and output and it will
given in a form of <unc> one-word </unc> curve alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#17:1:A>
Now suppose <,> this is a <unc> one-word </unc> curve okay
now then if the <unc> one-word </unc> curve is <,> a straight one
like this <,> then its <?> sensitivity </?> is simply given by the slope of
this straight line alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#18:1:A>
And more generally if instead of having one straight line like this
suppose the <unc> one- word </unc> curve is a curve like that then
its sensitivity at one particular <unc> one-word </unc> would be
given by the slope of the tangent to the required <unc> one-word
</unc> alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#19:1:A>
Now so in this case <,> the sensitivity would be a constant <,> for
all the input value all the input values

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#20:1:A>
Now on the other hand <,> if you got a <unc> one-word
</unc> curve like that then its <?> stability </?> would be a variable
depending on the input value

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#21:1:A>
So typically I may <?> said </?> that <,> sensitivity <,> would be
given by the rate of change of input to the rate of change of what sorry will
be the rate of change of output to the rate of change of input at the
required <unc> one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#22:1:A>
Okay so we can define sensitivity in this manner and this would be
a constant if the <unc> one-word </unc> curve instead of a straight
line otherwise it will be a variable depending on the input value alright <&>
A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#23:1:A>
Now this would be <unc> one-word </unc> curve only for a
different condition

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#24:1:A>
Now suppose there  ' s a change in the surrounding temperature for
example then such a <unc> one-word </unc> curve would also change
alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#25:1:A>
Now so suppose <,> the <unc> one-word </unc> curve change
in this manner alright the slope remains constant but then it will shift
upward or downward <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#26:1:A>
Now so if this is the case then this is what we sometimes call the
zero drift <,,> okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#27:1:A>
Now this particular case the slope of the tangent curve would be a
constant alright but then it will shift upward or downward depending on the
change in the surrounding condition <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#28:1:A>
Now but a more <unc> one-word </unc> case is that besides a
zero shift like that alright the slope of this line would also change alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#29:1:A>
So instead of having a curve like this then <,> we might have a
line of a different slope

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#30:1:A>
So in this particular case alright then there is a sensitivity
drift as well as a zero drift alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#31:1:A>
So this represent a sensitivity drift <,,> okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#32:1:A>
And this represent a change in the sensitivity for a given change
in condition <,,> alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#33:1:A>
So a typical instrument that have such a behaviour will be say for
example a pressure pitch alright <,,> according <unc> one-word </unc>
okay it should be such a type of behaviour when the surrounding temperature
shift <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#34:1:A>
Therefore whenever we look at the performance characteristic the
instrument then when we look at sensitivity okay we need to know its
sensitivity at a given condition plus the possible change in sensitivity when
the temperature okay surrounding condition changes <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#35:1:A>
Now you <?> choice </?> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#36:1:A>
Now besides sensitivity that another factor that we will need to
look at will be what we call <?> reality </?> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#37:1:A>
Yes

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-005#38:1:?> Can we almost a zero drift are the cause that even drift at
continue

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-005#39:1:A>
The zero drift results when the surrounding condition changes
alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#40:1:A>
Uh suppose when there  ' s a change in the surrounding temperature
now then suppose this is your original tangent curve <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#41:1:A>
Let say twenty degree C alright but instead of twenty degree C your
room temperature may fluctuate alright so you cannot it say that the
<unc> one-word </unc> curve could remain the same when the
temperature changes say to seventeen degree C alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#42:1:A>
So suppose when the temperature changes say to seventeen degree C
alright then suppose this is the resultant <,> tangent curve alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#43:1:A>
Then <,> this we call it the zero drift alright <,> it means even
when there is no input to the instrument the output of instrument would
fluctuate it will change <,> alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#44:1:A>
Now and in addition to this zero drift then its sensitivity or its
slope of this <unc> one-word </unc> curve would also change as a
result of say a change in the surrounding temperature okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#45:1:A>
So in reality when the surrounding condition changes then a typical
change in the <unc> one-word </unc> curve say when the sun like that
okay <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#46:1:A>
Therefore in addition of knowing the sensitivity at a different
condition which also be aware how its sensitivity change when the surrounding
condition changes because it  ' s to be important in determining what
instrument that you go to buy or or or specify alright <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#47:1:A>
Okay any further question <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#48:1:A>
Now then besides sensitivity <,> another plot that we would need to
look at would be reality <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#49:1:A>
Now when the instrument manufacturer tries to design an instrument
it would be always desirable that the input output characteristic alright
should be a linear straight line okay <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#50:1:A>
Because if the input output characteristic can be represented by a
straight line then it would make the subsequent signal processing system much
more <,> simpler <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#51:1:A>
So the instrument manufacturer would always try to aim to have this
input output characteristic

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#52:1:A>
Now but this is only the ideal case

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#53:1:A>
Now in reality it will be difficult for people to obtain such a
linear characteristic in their <unc> one- word </unc> curve <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#54:1:A>
Now so most probably <,> when you test the instrument then instead
of having a straight line like this then you  ' ll probably have the <unc>
one-word </unc> points represented a by a curve alright <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#55:1:A>
Now however sometimes <,> in the specification by the manufacturer
they would always try to assume that their characteristic is that of a
straight line and any deviation from a straight line they assume that it  ' s
an error alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#56:1:A>
Because in their design they try to achieve a straight line in the
output input characteristic alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#57:1:A>
So any deviation from a straight line they regard that error <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#58:1:A>
Now therefore <?> reality </?> is a measure of how the actual
<unc> one-word </unc> point deviate from a specified straight line
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#59:1:A>
Now if this is the <unc> one-word </unc> point alright the
question is how are we going to determine what is the straight line at which
we draw through all these <unc> one-word </unc> points

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#60:1:A>
Now one method could be to draw what we call the best straight line
through the point alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#61:1:A>
So that is one method alright <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#62:1:A>
And if we use this method then <,> we call this to be the best fit
<?> in reality </?> alright <,> okay we draw the best straight line through
this <unc> one-word </unc> points by means of a statistical method
alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#63:1:A>
Now but sometimes in order to simply the matter then instead of
drawing the best straight line through the <unc> one-word </unc>
plots people would just join <,> the first and the last point on the
<unc> one-word </unc> curve alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#64:1:A>
So they will just draw up these two points <,> okay <,> alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#65:1:A>
They assume that this is the straight line that represents the
characteristic of the instruments and any deviation from that to be an error
alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#66:1:A>
So if we try to do this then <,> this is what we call the terminal
<?> in reality </?> <,> alright <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#67:1:A>
Alright can you follow this

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#68:1:A>
Now therefore at any particular plot <,> uh suppose <,,> uh suppose
this is the actual <unc> one-word </unc> curve alright and suppose
this is the straight line that we are using alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#69:1:A>
Now then the error <,> that results by assuming the straight line
would be given by <,,> okay where Y X is your actual result from your
<unc> one- word </unc> alright and Y L X is the reading that you
obtain from this straight line that you assume to be the actual <unc>
one-word </unc> curve alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#70:1:A>
And therefore this represent an error okay and then normally the
error due to the <?> reality </?> would express the percentage of the full
scale output <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#71:1:A>
Okay so that is how we try to represent the error due to the
non-linear not due to a linear of the <unc> one-word </unc> curve
alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#72:1:A>
Okay and this value would represent the maximum value of this one
alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#73:1:A>
So for this curve here then the maximum value would occur at above
this point okay <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#74:1:A>
Okay <{1> <[1> <,> yes <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#75:1:A>
This represent the full scale output now so in this <unc>
one-word </unc> case now if this <,> is the input and so if that  ' s the
output alright then the full scale output would be given by this value okay
<,> alright this would be out <unc> one-word </unc> <,,> okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#76:1:A>
So when we try to express the error we often do it as a percentage
of the full scale output okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#77:1:A>
That  ' s how we now we  ' re doing <,,> <{2> <[2> alright okay </[2>

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-005#78:1:?> <[1> <unc> three-words </unc> </[1> </{1>

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-005#79:1:?> <[2> <?> Professor </?> </[2> </{2> <unc> three words
</unc> in the earth uh I mean the <unc> two-words </unc>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-005#80:1:A>
Well when you try to draw this <,> you are drawing what we
call the best straight line through all these points alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#81:1:A>
So if you study Mathematics you can do it by a linear by a linear
equation act alright <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#82:1:A>
Now if you having early then we  ' ll discuss later on alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#83:1:A>
Now this is a this school method that would allow you to draw the
best point through all these straight lines

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#84:1:A>
Now it means <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#85:1:A>
Now <,> now suppose this is the the actual <unc> one-word
</unc> plots alright <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#86:1:A>
Now if this is the <unc> one-word </unc> points then you
can draw several straight lines through these points

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#87:1:A>
Now if you do not do it by statistical method now if we just do
initially then the first person may draw a straight line like this okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#88:1:A>
Now but the same person he may not show you he he may not share
your view he might draw the straight line say <,> in another manner and so on
okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#89:1:A>
So different people can draw different straight lines through the
same set of the the points so it is highly undesirable okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#90:1:A>
Therefore it would need to <?> devise </?> a method whereby
everybody use the method would come to the same conclusion for the same set
of experimental points okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#91:1:A>
So the method of linear regression <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#92:1:A>
Now so the method that people normally use would be to draw a
straight line through all these points so that the deviation of the plot from
the straight line would be an a minimum okay that means we try to minimize
all these distance <,> alright <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#93:1:A>
So we will discuss this method later on alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#94:1:A>
Okay any question

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#95:1:A>
Now so if we draw the straight line by this method alright then the
straight line obtained is what we call the best straight line through the at
that points alright <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#96:1:A>
Now then besides <?> in reality </?> that the third factor uh we
would like to look at will be what we call the inability inability and it is
a measure of inability of the instrument to <?> gave </?> the same reading
under the same input condition alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#97:1:A>
Now if you try to measure the output of a instrument for different
input uh suppose the try to measure uh temperature at a hundred degree C
alright by putting the thermometer into a <unc> one-word </unc> of
boiling water <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#98:1:A>
Now consider this we know that the input must be a hundred degree C
by definition alright <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#99:1:A>
Now but if you repeat the process a bit again with the same
instrument under the same condition you do not necessary get the same reading
any time alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#100:1:A>
Uh the first time you may get a reading of hundred degree C now
the second time you may get a reading of hundred and one for example alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#101:1:A>
And the third time you may get a reading of ninety nine degree and
so on alright <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#102:1:A>
So there would be different readings given at different time for
the same input condition alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#103:1:A>
Now therefore if inability is a measure of how the instrument
behave under such type of condition <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#104:1:A>
So <,> if again if we look at <unc> one-word </unc> curve
like this alright now for the same input <,> if we are able to repeat its <?>
range </?> a large <?> amount </?> of times that would actually find that the
output will be distributed above the best straight line like this alright <&>
A long pause </&> okay <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#105:1:A>
So by <?> similar </?> condition they can output with vary and
inability is a measure of how this plot was spread above your even <unc>
one-word </unc> curve alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-005#106:1:A>
And so normally the inability is <?> express </?> in terms of
standard deviation of the experimental plots </I>
