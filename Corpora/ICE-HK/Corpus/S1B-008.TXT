<ICE-HK:S1B-008#1:1:A>
And uh so what what is the relationship now then between
industrialization and family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#2:1:A>
Now there has been the argument proposed by uh some sociologists
that industrialization has talked about changes in the form in the size the
functions as well as the nature of the family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#3:1:A>
There  ' s a lot of thing let me explain it

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#4:1:A>
So industrialization talk about changes in form first the form of
the family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#5:1:A>
And secondly the size of the family and then the functions of the
family as well as the nature of the family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#6:1:A>
Let me briefly explain this and then I  ' ll expand on this
relationship between industrialization and family in the rest of this lecture

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#7:1:A>
So let me start with the idea of form of the family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#8:1:A>
Now in my first lecture on family I uh introduce two major forms of
the family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#9:1:A>
So one major form I said was the nuclear family consisting parent
and the children the nuclear family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#10:1:A>
And the other major form of the family so called extended family
including the horizontally extended family as well as the vertical extended
family that is you know somehow is an extension of the nuclear family
including some <?> restricted </?> relation with other relatives and so on
and so

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#11:1:A>
It  ' s an expansion on the nuclear family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#12:1:A>
And the general argument here about the effect of industrialization
on the family with regard the form is that <,> in the pre- industrial
traditional society the extended family was the typical form

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#13:1:A>
Now when I said it was a typical form I do not mean that all
families took this form in the pre- industrial society that mean is that you
know you have those far more extended family in the pre-industrial society it
was a typical form it  ' s a common form of family in the pre- industrial or
traditional society that is before industrialization you have this extended
form of family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#14:1:A>
And in the industrial society that is after industrialization the
typical the common form of the family in a modern industrial society is the
nuclear family so that is the change in the form of family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#15:1:A>
And these changes as I said have been explained as effect of
industrialization

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#16:1:A>
And lastly the size the size effect it is of course related to the
form

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#17:1:A>
Uh usually you can say that when you have the uh extended family
you have more people in family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#18:1:A>
You have grandparents or other relatives you know and that is the
size the idea of size how many people in the family but the general argument
here is that uh somehow in the modern industrial society the family is much
smaller in size so that  ' s in the pre-industrial traditional society
typically have the large extended family of may be ten people fifteen people
even more you know

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#19:1:A>
Uh somewhat like uh you know <,> the the picture describe in the
Dream of the Red Chamber <indig> huhng lauh muhng </indig> <&> This is the
Chinese name of the Dream of the Red Chamber </&> many many people there and
of course when you when you have people you have trouble

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#20:1:A>
When you have many people you have many trouble and when you have
many trouble you can write as a novel to talk about

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#21:1:A>
So perhaps uh that  ' s idea of size of the family so and now you say
that you know in the modern industrial society for instance in Hong Kong the
typical size of family is of course not ten fifteen or twenty or something
but may be four or five or even less than four or five in the family that  ' s
idea of size

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#22:1:A>
And of course later on we  ' ll consider why will there be such
changes consequent upon industrialization so and then the function of the
family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#23:1:A>
And here the argument is that uh the modern family in an industrial
society has lost many of its traditional functions

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#24:1:A>
You might say that it lost many of <.> trad </.> of traditional
function

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#25:1:A>
I have to start the rough idea of what had been the traditional
functions of the family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#26:1:A>
Now I I had talk about the function of family in previous lecture
so let me go through it very quickly you know

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#27:1:A>
So apart from the uh say sexual function reproductive function
there is an economic function except here that economic function as referring
to the economic function of the traditional family is that function of
production within the family that is the idea here is that the family in the
pre-industrial society perform the function of economic production

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#28:1:A>
What does that mean you know economic production

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#29:1:A>
It means that the family together work as a team

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#30:1:A>
Say for instance in the agrarian industrial agrarian society you
know the family all the family members you know they work on the land you
know growing the crops agricultural activities or what in handcraft industry
you know that is they manufacture certain <?> articles </?> by hand you know
handcraft industry

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#31:1:A>
So family members who work together within a family and therefore
that is idea of the traditional industrial family as a production unit or as
a unit of production they that  ' s the economic function

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#32:1:A>
And then <?> there is </?> also the idea of educational function
which I also mention before but I would like to qualify the educational
function of the pre-industrial family you know

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#33:1:A>
Uh because you know when you talk about the educational function of
the industrial family here the educational function not only refers to the
socialization function it also really just refers to form formal education
you know but in fact in the <unc> one-word </unc> talk about formal
education it  ' s a it  ' s not like the formal education we had now

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#34:1:A>
And that refers to the learning of skill the occupational skill you
know from you know senior members of the family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#35:1:A>
For instance in agricultural activities or in handcraft industry
performed in a family you know the younger member of the family the children
typically learn these skill occupational skill from their parent and that is
the idea of educational function which is somewhat different from
socialization <?> fun </?> function you know meaning bringing up children uh
introducing them into society some of different than educational <unc>
one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#36:1:A>
And then apart from this function I  ' ve mentioned you know uh there
are other functions of the pre-industrial family or the family in the
pre-industrial society including uh for instance the uh say the so-called job
placement job placement function <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#37:1:A>
So the job placement function so what is it idea of job placement

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#38:1:A>
It simply means that the family or the members of the of the family
can help you to find job can place me a certain job

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#39:1:A>
In other the argument here is that in pre-industrial agrarian
society when member of the family are looking for job

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#40:1:A>
Typically they try to find help from their family member

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#41:1:A>
And it also means that you know in this pre- industrial society
sometimes the family running a certain business and then that business is
pass on to their younger children pass on to their offspring

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#42:1:A>
In other words somehow you just inherit the occupation of your
parent you know or you get help from your parents or from other kinsmen
within the family you know in order to look for job right

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#43:1:A>
They can use their influence to place you in certain job so that
idea of job placement function which is uh seldom perform I can say by the
family today the job placement function

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#44:1:A>
And another function is called the status conferring function

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#45:1:A>
So what is this idea of status conferring function

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#46:1:A>
Status conferring means you know it gives you confer it  ' s giving
you give you a certain status

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#47:1:A>
And the idea here is that uh somehow the traditional family can
give people a certain position or different status in society

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#48:1:A>
And here is the idea of inheritance of status you know from senior
member of the family particularly in feudalist society

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#49:1:A>
In other words you say if your father is a landlord it  ' s extremely
likely that you know the children will also inherit that status or an
aristocrat they would inherit that status you know it has the status
conferring function

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#50:1:A>
In other words obtain the status in society from their family or
under very much under the influence of their family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#51:1:A>
So if your family is doing well then you will also do well you will
have a high status

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#52:1:A>
Conversely if your family has a low status you  ' ll very likely to
have all low status in society that is the status conferring function

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#53:1:A>
And then other some other functions included the so-called welfare
function so the welfare function

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#54:1:A>
So the idea here is that well when you are sick you know and then
it  ' s typically your members of the family will look after you you know or
when you are in need of services and so on you know you have to reply almost
entirely on your family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#55:1:A>
So obviously it  ' s it it  ' s a matter of degree in the family today
perform the welfare function

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#56:1:A>
But the point here is in the pre-industrial society the family is
almost entirely up to the families perform this welfare function

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#57:1:A>
You depend on your kinsmen within a family to look after you to to
provide you with goods and services

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#58:1:A>
And uh there is also the idea of the religious function that is you
know religious function is meaning that you know members of the family you
know they perform religious worship or the worship of ancestors within a
family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#59:1:A>
And of course there is uh also the uh <?> affectional </?> function
or sometimes called the affective or <?> affectional </?> function which is
quite obvious you know

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#60:1:A>
The idea of the <?> affectional </?> function is that you obtain
the affection warm emotional support understanding from <unc> one-word
</unc> the member of the family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#61:1:A>
So in other words you know in traditional family it perform all
these function

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#62:1:A>
And then idea the loss of functions loss of many of traditional
function in the family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#63:1:A>
The idea of loss of function is that today the family no longer
performs that particular function

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#64:1:A>
And sociologists have even argued that uh the major function
nowadays perform by the family that is by family industrial society are
mainly the socialization function and the affective function or the <?>
affectional </?> function

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#65:1:A>
So socialization that is upbringing of children and providing
support emotional support warm and understanding these are the two major
function <?> of family </?> in the industrial society

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#66:1:A>
And therefore you can see that there is the idea of loss of
function within family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#67:1:A>
And now let take a look at the idea of nature of the family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#68:1:A>
Okay talk about the nature of the family I have to refer uh to uh
<,> what I earlier refer as very high power sociologist you know who that
high power sociologist

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#69:1:A>
His name somehow if you mention would uh impress other people in
impress other Sociology student you know

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#70:1:A>
Now you remember that name <,> <unc> two-words </unc> and I
said that <unc> two- words </unc> I mean you know write in a very
difficult manner you know writes in long long sentences

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#71:1:A>
You remember that one sentence one sentence consists hundred words
so uh on

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#72:1:A>
And by time you come to the end of sentence you already forgot what
what  ' s said in the first part of the sentence right <unc> two-words
</unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#73:1:A>
So uh his name is in your lecture outline if you have got the out
the outline <unc> two-words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#74:1:A>
Now I think I will remind you that there is a N at the end
<unc> two-words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#75:1:A>
His name <unc> one-word </unc> has an N because again and
again I come across students writing <unc> one-word </unc> instead of
<unc> one-word </unc> in examination

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#76:1:A>
So <unc> one-word </unc> don't <unc> one-word
</unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#77:1:A>
Now about the nature of the family <unc> two-words </unc>
had put forward his argument

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#78:1:A>
He said that the typical kind of family in a modern industrial
society is what we call the isolated nuclear family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#79:1:A>
The isolated nuclear family <,> so the isolated nuclear family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#80:1:A>
Now you know the idea of the nuclear family and proposed the idea
of isolated and this argument from <unc> two-words </unc> about the
isolated nuclear family as a typical form of family in a modern industrial
society has referred to as the isolated nuclear family thesis

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#81:1:A>
The thesis is an argument and <unc> one-word </unc> his
argument

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#82:1:A>
So as I said you know <unc> two-words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#83:1:A>
What is idea of isolated right

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#84:1:A>
Now when <?> Tarcott Parsons </?> talks about isolated nuclear
family it means isolated or isolation in two senses

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#85:1:A>
In the first sense it is isolation or isolated from kinsmen
isolating from family or isolating from kinsfolk

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#86:1:A>
I better use kinsfolk rather than kinsmen I don't like the word men
in kinsmen because it implies only men

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#87:1:A>
And kinsfolk include both men and women

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#88:1:A>
Isolation from kinsmen so the idea of isolated from kinsmen yeah
meaning that you know somehow the modern family you know are maintains few
relationship and have few interactions with their kinsmen with their with
their kinsfolk you know their relative

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#89:1:A>
In other word they don't see their relatives so often you know <.>
com </.> compare to the family in the traditional industrial society so <?>
next </?> this point

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#90:1:A>
That  ' s one meaning of isolation

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#91:1:A>
The second meaning of isolation relate to the idea of the loss of
function by the modern family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#92:1:A>
Therefore the second idea of isolation is isolation from the social
structure or the isolation from society

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#93:1:A>
The idea of isolation from social structure or isolation from so
from society is that previously in the pre-industrial society the family
performs so many important function

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#94:1:A>
It perform so many important function is that it was very well
integrated into society or a central part or a major institution in society

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#95:1:A>
So it was well integrated well connected with all aspects of
society whereas now the loss of many of these function the family plays new
new a role okay has fewer function to perform

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#96:1:A>
And therefore in that sense it  ' s isolated it seems to be and that
is isolated from society so that is the second meaning of isolation

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#97:1:A>
Now uh and having put forward this idea of the isolated nuclear
family <unc> two-words </unc> then goes on to explain why
industrialization has brought about such changes in the family you know there  ' s
changes in the form the size and nature and function of family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#98:1:A>
So here we comes to the explanation of the relationship between
industrialization and the family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#99:1:A>
What has gone before is sort of just classification of term and so
on

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#100:1:A>
Now and the <unc> two-words </unc> and some other
sociologists maintain that there is the fit so they introduce the idea of fit

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#101:1:A>
There is a fit between the industrial society and the nuclear
family or you can say there is a fit between the industrial society and the
isolated nuclear family

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#102:1:A>
So uh this has been referred to as the fit hypothesis or you can
call it the fit thesis

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#103:1:A>
So then what is this idea of the fit you know

<ICE-HK:S1B-008#104:1:A>
So the point about the fit the argument about this fit is between
the industrial society and nuclear family is that the industrial society has
certain characteristics which are quite different from the characteristics of
the pre-industrial society </I>
