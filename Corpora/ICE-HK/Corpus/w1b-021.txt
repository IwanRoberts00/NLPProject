Dear Mr. Piccolo ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-021#126:5>
It was a great pleasure for all of us to have you as our guest
during your recent visit .

<ICE-HK:W1B-021#127:5>
I hope it was a pleasant one . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-021#128:5>
Upon checking-out , you ask our Guest Service Agent to charge
the extra 3 nights room charges by using your Sheraton ClubMiles .

<ICE-HK:W1B-021#129:5>
After checking with our Award center , I was advised that the
remaining ClubMiles balance in your account was not enough to cover another 3
extra nights .

<ICE-HK:W1B-021#130:5>
Since you have already used 21,000 ClubMiles to cover the first 3
nights , i.e. March 30 , 30 &ampersand; April 01 , 1995 , while your room was
from March 30-April 05 , 1995 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-021#131:5>
I understand that it has been agreed by you with our Guest
Service Agent , a back charge at our package rate would be arranged to your
American Express credit card accordingly if the Miles is not <-> enought </->
<+> enough </+> to cover .

<ICE-HK:W1B-021#132:5>
The package rate for a double room is &dollar;1630 &plus;
15&percent; service charge &ampersand; tax per night , and &dollar;1550
&plus; 15&percent; for the 3rd night .

<ICE-HK:W1B-021#133:5>
Therefore a total of HK&dollar;5531.50 have been debited to your
American Express card <@> 47569446637009 </@> according .

<ICE-HK:W1B-021#134:5>
Copies of relevant hotel bill and charge receipt are enclosed for
your reference . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-021#135:5>
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any queries .

Dear Mr. Ohrwall ,

<p>

I am writing in response to your fax today to Angeline . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-021#178:8>
Refer to the Membership Update , it did not specifically
indicated that our &ldquo; Towers &rdquo; doesn't participate in this offer ,
while our &ldquo; Main Hotel &rdquo; does .

<ICE-HK:W1B-021#179:8>
It is because individual hotel can apply differently base on the
availability of their Towers section and some of them does not have Towers ,
therefore we only indicate that it is based upon Program Availability at the
time of reservation , and advance reservation required .

<ICE-HK:W1B-021#180:8>
On the other hand , we have limited number of Towers rooms and the
cost at our Towers is very high as it offer <-> exculsive </-> <+> exclusive
</+> service , such as complimentary : breakfast , afternoon tea , evening
cocktail and Free laundry and pressing service . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-021#181:8>
The Free Bonus Night is available for you during Feb 07-11 ,
1995 in main hotel .

<ICE-HK:W1B-021#182:8>
I may suggest you to stay with our main hotel for the first two
nights so as to enjoy this special offer and then change back to Towers for
the rest of your stay if you don't mind of moving . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-021#183:8>
Please let me know if you accept this so as to change your
reservation according .

goodself . </p>

I refer to the information that you sent me on Birmingham
College of Food , Tourism and Creative Studies, and Open Learning Agency .
</p>

1. If the joint programme in Hotel, Catering and Institutional
Management will save the students  '  time in studying the bridging course in
Birmingham College of Food , Tourism and Creative Studies , I think it is
worth to give it a trial .

<ICE-HK:W1B-021#222:10>
However , some technical problems need to be sorted out before
offering the joint programme in September 1994 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-021#223:10>
For instance , will this joint programme be running side by side
with our Hotel Business Course ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-021#224:10>
Is the compulsory component of internship or job in a Hong Kong
Hotel or Catering Establishment a year long ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-021#225:10>
2. I think the Tourism Supervisory level Development programme
of the Open Learning Agency can be offered as a M.M.E.P. course and also
repackaged as a certificate television course .

<ICE-HK:W1B-021#226:10>
Moreover , I would like to know if the OLA can include graduates of
the Tourist Business Programme of Bianchi College .

<ICE-HK:W1B-021#227:10>
Thank you for your attention .
