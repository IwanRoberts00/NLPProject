<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-044#1:1:A>
Okay don't worry <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#2:1:A>
Now <,> one <?> of the </?> two thing I would like to tell you is
<,,> environmentally speaking <?> two thing important </?> one was <,> the
outbreak of fire <,,> and the second was flooding <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#3:1:A>
I think these two remain <.> haz </.> hazards <,> or dangers for
traditional China <,> and they cause a lot of <,> environmental problems <,>
fire and <?> trouble </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#4:1:A>
But there were forest fires <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#5:1:A>
Uh forest fires in China were not as <,> serious as those in the
West <,> as we found them <,> but there were still because it it was limited
usually to the places <,> where people went to the grave <,> graveyard <,> uh

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#6:1:A>
That  ' s the same <?> todays </?> when people have to <,> burn their
<,> papers <,> their incents <,> they <?> left </?> <,> some fire

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#7:1:A>
So <,> a lot of fires were <,> were were were were were were seen or
or broke out <,> at the hills and mountains where people went <,> to <,> uh
to sweep their homes

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#8:1:A>
That is true but it was limited to certain area <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#9:1:A>
Uh fires <,> in the forest people ignore <,> I  ' m sure about that
<,> but we don't have big fires <,> reported

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#10:1:A>
But <,> fire within the cities <,> were more important because <,>
there were too many people there <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#11:1:A>
Now <,> uh for example in uh particular in uh in <,> a prosperous
city like Hangzhou <,> uh in in main <,> in in in the central uh <unc>
one word </unc> we found that that <,,> fire <,,> hazard or so important
so serious that they broke out <,> practically every day <,,> because <,> the
streets were narrow <,,> most of the <,> uh buildings were made of wood in
the south <,> central made of wood <,> in the north made of bricks <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#12:1:A>
Usually <,> okay <,> usually ask official opinion

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#13:1:A>
And <,,> how do they <,> how do they <,,> safeguard fires <,> I
have to declaim

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#14:1:A>
The the way to do it was to <,> uh I have in each of the city there
were about several hundred soldiers <,> whose task <,> it was to prevent <,>
fire

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#15:1:A>
And there were towers <,> built up <,> very high <,> higher than
all the buildings <,> and up there <,> there  ' ll there  ' ll there  ' ll there  ' ll
there will be one or two sentry <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#16:1:A>
Downstairs there <unc> several-words </unc> in the daytime
when there was a fire somewhere in the north <,> they would raise their flag
<,> to the north

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#17:1:A>
And then people who look at your flag will know ah there is a fire
there

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#18:1:A>
And then down there will be people <,> with buckets not people
soldiers

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#19:1:A>
Water bucket <,> water hoses <,> uh and also ropes <,> and also
axes <,> uh for breaking into the <unc> 1-word </unc> houses

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#20:1:A>
There are lot of <unc> 1-word </unc> there  ' s a once <,>
they knew that there was a fire <,> these people would <,> look at them <,>
and went to that particular <,> place or building <,,> to prevent the fire
from spreading

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#21:1:A>
I don't know <,> in the <.> s </.> in in the <.> win </.> in in the
dark <,> say at night <,> they will use lanterns <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#22:1:A>
The same <,> the lantern when it point to the north <,> it means
fire in the north etcetera <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#23:1:A>
But still <,,> using buckets <,> I mean <,> sometimes you cannot
<,,> <.> h </.> help to <,> to <.> extin </.> <,> extinguish the fires which
<,> <unc> several-words </unc> other <,> uh big cities

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#24:1:A>
The way to do it was to build artificial channels <,> uh uh <.> ta
</.> channels that is to say <,> an artificial waterway was built <,>
particularly for the sake of uh <,> putting all the valuable things <,> in
the centre

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#25:1:A>
So most rich people will build their godowns <,> inside that <,>
artificial <,> uh uh uh waterway

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#26:1:A>
So whenever there was a fire <,> people would go <?> oh </?> we got
<,> water there then use the water to <,> to to to to extinguish the fire

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#27:1:A>
But it was very expensive <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#28:1:A>
So <,> there were many many other ways to prevent fire I only one
<unc> two words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#29:1:A>
But another <,> most important hazard was <,> flooding <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#30:1:A>
Now flooding was even more serious than fire because <,> it <,> it
had <,> uh it more harm <,> it <,> destroy more homes <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#31:1:A>
But the attention was usually to the Yellow River <,> because it
was where the capital and most important <,> uh cities <,> were situated

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#32:1:A>
So <,> the Chinese were very much concerned with <,> how to control
flood <,> and the changing of the Yellow River course <,> but not those in
the Yansi or the Pearl River

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#33:1:A>
And that is the reason <?> why </?> in in the present day <,> we
need to do a lot on the Yansi River but not in the Yellow River <,> because
the Yellow River had been <,> the attention <,> of governments <,> for a long
time

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#34:1:A>
They ignore the Yansi <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#35:1:A>
They ignore <,> the Pearl River okay <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#36:1:A>
So far <,> I can't go to the detail but all I want to say to you
was <,> so far the way to prevent <,> flooding <,> was to <?> enraise </?>
the embankment

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#37:1:A>
So <,> once you see the water level has reached <,> very high then
people <,> uh will be <?> asked </?> <.> or forced to build embankment higher
embankment <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#38:1:A>
So we will find that <,> as time went on when embankment was very
high but still there were flooding

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#39:1:A>
Only until the seventeenth century <,> uhm the Kinsu Emperor <,> uh
<,,> <unc> two-words </unc> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#40:1:A>
I try my best to to be quick <,> but I think I  ' m trying my
<unc> two words </unc> <,,> I got some <unc> several words
</unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#41:1:A>
Now the Kinsu Emperor was <,,> taught or <.> arc </.> by the
Jesuits <,> the missionaries <,,> to <,> have the technique of <,> <?>
deepering </?> the river bed <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#42:1:A>
Instead of <,> <?> enraising </?> the <,> embankment <,> the <,>
the the the the work was to <,> was to <,> deepen the river bed so so that
<,> so it was a very effective way of preventing flood

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#43:1:A>
That was in the seventeenth century <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#44:1:A>
Kinsu was helped <,> because formerly <,> people did not how to go
down the river and do work there

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#45:1:A>
But that was <,> the the technique <,> was taught by the Jesuit
fathers <,> when they came to China in the eighteenth century

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#46:1:A>
Kinsu <,> was one of the most enlightened of the <unc>
several-words </unc> enlightened Emperor in China <,> who would accept
western <,> techniques <,> would <unc> several-words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#47:1:A>
I would love to talk about it and this is urban planning

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#48:1:A>
I can say more about it

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#49:1:A>
But what <,> I  ' m trying to tell you is that <,> the two hazards
<,> were there <,> you can ask me question afterwards <,> I think <,> but I
think most important point as I would like to say to you <,,> the <,> what we
call personal hygienes

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#50:1:A>
Environmental <,> situation <,> was closely involved with personal
hygienes

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#51:1:A>
For example <,> the spread of diseases <,> would be important if
<,> there were a lot of germs

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#52:1:A>
What about bathing <,> washing one  ' s body <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#53:1:A>
Now I <,> <&> cough </&> <?> not work </?> on that I can't go into
detail but <,> I would like to tell you that <,> in even in the sixth and
seventh century <,> sixth and seventh centuries uh <,,> in central China
there were public <,> and private baths <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#54:1:A>
People went to <,> to to to wash their bodies <,> in the public
bath say <,> uh once <,> two times <,> in uh <,> uh one in two days  '  time
<,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#55:1:A>
So a lot of people <,> <unc> 3-words </unc> importance of
bathing and <,> even there was hot water bath for the westerners <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#56:1:A>
The Chinese <,> had no <,> <.> war </.> warm water

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#57:1:A>
<.> War </.> <.> war </.> <.> war </.> warm water had to be boiled
you know so it was very difficult only for the <,,> for the foreigners <,>
they were treated with warm water

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#58:1:A>
And <,> but in the north <,> bathing was <,> quite a rare thing
because the weather was cold and there was less of uh <,> rivers and all that
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#59:1:A>
Apart from washing <,> brushing the teeth <,> now the Chinese for
information <,> were the first <,> people for most at least as far as I can
see <,> who knew how to brush their teeth <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#60:1:A>
<?> Twelfth </?> century <,> we brush our teeth <,> or <,> with
vegetables <,> with grass and all that <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#61:1:A>
Uh the the westerner did not know how to brush their teeth until
the eighteenth and nineteenth century

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#62:1:A>
<?> That is true </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#63:1:A>
So <,> there were a lot of things were not found in the <,> in <?>
Needham  ' s </?> work for example this <,> but <,> which I think would be find
in <,> in <,> narratives <,> biographies in all this so <?> different </?>
things you know

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#64:1:A>
Okay <,> so <,> most important I think for personal hygiene was <,>
how to dispose the waste <,,> or <,> I don't know whether you agree with me

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#65:1:A>
I went to Edinburgh uh uh to Manchester <,> and then discover that
there there was a museum on <.> subter </.> <.> rran </.> <.> rran </.> <.>
subter </.> <.> subterran </.> <,> subterranean museum <,> that is to say <,>
to tell you the origin and history of <,> waste disposal in England <,> from
<,> the time immemorial right up to the present time <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#66:1:A>
I spend at least <,,> half a day there <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#67:1:A>
So they <,> they give you all the drawings the reason why <,> and
to be honest the original one <,> you got all the water sound there and only
to sit there and <,> and try

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#68:1:A>
The same as what we are <,> exactly <.> di </.> different that is
<unc> several words </unc> <,> like this a square one

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#69:1:A>
So <,> the uh the Chinese we got a bucket the <indig> mah tung
</indig> <&> Chinese style toilet </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#70:1:A>
So <,> they they they use a square thing but the same <,> people
would come <,> up here and take away the waste <,> the same as the Chinese

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#71:1:A>
What  ' s of difference <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#72:1:A>
The difference is that <,> the Chinese continued to use a <.> buck
</.> the <indig> mah tung </indig> <,,> well until <,> the twentieth century
even <,,> when I was small <,> I have to use a <indig> mah tung </indig>
before the water toilet <,> was uh was uh implemented

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#73:1:A>
I don't know whether you have used it

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#74:1:A>
Ask your father

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#75:1:A>
Ask your <,> grandfather

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#76:1:A>
They will know it

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#77:1:A>
But for the west it was different because of <,> the reason why
they are different they are different because the Chinese did continue <,> to
be agricultural <,> until the twentieth century

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#78:1:A>
And <,> the so-called <,> waste was used <,> as a fertilizer <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#79:1:A>
People come into your place to buy it <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#80:1:A>
I don't know whether you agree with

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#81:1:A>
They they said oh <,> are you got <unc> one word </unc> <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#82:1:A>
I I would like to buy your <,> waste you know

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#83:1:A>
So that was the case in the countryside <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#84:1:A>
But in the west because of industrial revolution say in the
nineteenth century <,> agriculture had no longer been <,> important

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#85:1:A>
So there are many other reason the invention of uh chlorine and all
this so <,> and all the how to uh neutralize the the the waste

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#86:1:A>
But neutralizing the waste means <,> it was not <,> could not be
used for fertilizer <,> anymore

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#87:1:A>
So <,> I can't go into detail but it was very interesting for
example when we go to the <,> Tower Bridge <,> in England <,> there was a
space <,> below <,> the window <,> there was all no <,> everywhere was clean
<,> <.> f </.> fertile with <,> flowers and that little part <,> was always
<,> <?> going </?> to die

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#88:1:A>
I I saw it there was no grass there no <,> <unc> one word
</unc> weeds <,> and then the guide <,> Westerner <,> told me that it was
a place <,> where waste was disposed <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#89:1:A>
So <,> I said how why <,> and then he then he brought us <,> right
up to the <,> to the <,> high up to the tower <,> and there we found a toilet

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#90:1:A>
A real the toilet I saw in Manchester <,> there you got a hole
there <,> the Royal <,> <?> big </?> person <,> queen <,> king or princess or
prince <,> just <,> did their <,> they they had they had a toilet there <,>
and the and all the waste would come down to that particular <.> s </.> place
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#91:1:A>
Really I mean I  ' m not <?> telling this </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#92:1:A>
I mean I just got all the information <,> a few few I mean a few
months ago when I was in in England <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#93:1:A>
So <,,> I found that that <,> traditional China <,> traditional <,>
Europe were more or less the same <,> excepted that of course <,> the west
improve very quickly <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#94:1:A>
The Chinese remain agricultural

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#95:1:A>
But basically the waste <,> wasn't that bad

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#96:1:A>
It wasn't the <,> it wasn't the agent or <.> tran </.> transmitting
for for <,> uh for for <,> uh uh for the disease transmission no <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#97:1:A>
The <,> main <,> difficulty I think was rats <,> in traditional
China as well as in uh <,> in in in <,> in the west

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#98:1:A>
But there was no Black Death in China <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#99:1:A>
There were a lot of <,> uhm a lot of uh <.> lo </.> localized
poisoning localized <,> uh plague you know many particularly in Hong Kong <,>
the two <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#100:1:A>
I <,> just try to advertise myself a bit here

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#101:1:A>
Uh this is the book I uh I translate called the <,> Water <,> For
A Barren Rock

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#102:1:A>
This is the history of uh uh water in in in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#103:1:A>
So water uh that that is a quite I I I I did a lot of research but
I I  ' m the one who translated the book <,> from the Chinese into English

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#104:1:A>
Now this book shows you one thing that is to say <,> because of
the shortage of water <,,> good water <,> there were plagues in Hong Kong and
people thought that it was rat and all that but <,> the actual reason we can
report one thing we should <unc> several words </unc> <&> tape change
to side B </&> were the only source of <,> containing or the or retaining
water <,> for the common <?> people </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#105:1:A>
Now wells in China of course I talk a lot of wells here <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#106:1:A>
Here of course they were regarded as being poisonous many of them

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#107:1:A>
But in traditional China wells was suppose to be W E L L S <,>
wells was supposed to be clean <,> and <,> you <?> dug a well </?> good
enough wells <,> then <,> the situation will be okay <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#108:1:A>
So <,> we have to go into <,> wells <?> again </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#109:1:A>
Uh I got a book too on the rats and everything <,> living on this
land and to us <,> rats <,> are not that bad you know <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#110:1:A>
Uhm you can <,> you you say the rats as being the <,,> as being
the <,,> uh clever <,,> but they were not poisonous <,,> and uh I show you
some of the rats here I I just <,,> I want to show you some of the pictures
of the rats here <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#111:1:A>
<unc> one word </unc> how <,> I I I pass it round so that
you can have a look at the <,,> uh uh two of you

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#112:1:A>
Just have a look okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#113:1:A>
Uh <,> now <,> now <,> I would like to end the whole thing here
because <unc> several words </unc> <,,> too much to say

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#114:1:A>
That is too say <,> why did all these so <,> uh <,> traditional
things <,,> come into <,> a head <,> by the time China <,> enter the
twentieth century <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#115:1:A>
Now when I <,> went to uhm Beijing in nineteen ninety-one I <,> I
went up to the Great Wall <,> <indig> cheuhng cheuhng sihng </indig>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#116:1:A>
I saw <,> good scenary there <,> big <,> construction <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#117:1:A>
I was impressed

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#118:1:A>
But when I look down <,> on the hill <,> I found so much waste
there <,> a lot of waste paper <,> a lot of <,> disposal dumping

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#119:1:A>
People just dump things onto the hills

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#120:1:A>
So look up you see big thing look down you see all the waste

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#121:1:A>
That was nineteen ninety-two

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#122:1:A>
And there I also took the railway <,> and uh it was a funny way
<unc> several-words </unc> one with glasses <,> big bun <,> and you
could boil a kettle there you need a <unc> one word </unc> <,,> boil
water there and then and drink the water <,> you cook your own water inside
the room

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#123:1:A>
But then <,> one thing

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#124:1:A>
That was good

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#125:1:A>
Now one thing impress me was <,> that the people also took <,>
chicken wings chicken <,> legs whatever

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#126:1:A>
Once they finish it they just <,> open the window and throw it
away <,> just like that

<ICE-HK:S2A-044#127:1:A>
And that was nineteen ninety-one <,,>
</I>
