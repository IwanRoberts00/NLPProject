Hong Kong Police Force goes hi-tech in fight against crime </bold>
</h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#2:1>
By Ir Jolly Wong </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#3:1>
Officially formed in 1844 , when the first Police Force Ordinance
was passed , the Hong Kong Police Force &obrack;  HKPF &cbrack; has the distinction of being
one of the oldest , yet most modern , police force in the world .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#4:1>
Protecting life and property in the 21st century , however , involves
far more than the latest concepts in law enforcement; state-of-the-art
communications , computer and many other technologies are equally essential .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#5:1>
Mapped out as a priority in the Force 2002-2004 Strategic Action
Plan , modernisation through the design and roll-out of the Third Generation
Command and Control Communications &obrack;  CC3 &cbrack; project represents the Force  ' s
biggest investment in technology to date . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#6:1>
Background </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#7:1>
The usefulness of mobile radios and dispatchers was first
recognised by the public safety and emergency agencies .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#8:1>
In 1921 , the US Detroit Police Department started the first police
car radio dispatching system consisting of bulky vacuum-tube equipment that
required powerful batteries .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#9:1>
It was 55 years later that the First Generation of Command and Control
Communication &obrack;  CC1 &cbrack; project was implemented by the HKPF , based on
solid-state electronics .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#10:1>
The Best Radio scheme and computer-assisted command and control
systems &obrack;  CACCS &cbrack; at police district control centers provided vastly improved
command capability and permitted immediate access by field duties to all the
support resources of the Force . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#11:1>
CC1 was replaced by the Second Generation of Command and Control
Communications &obrack;  CC2 &cbrack; in 1990 , at a cost of around HK&dollar;410 million .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#12:1>
It comprises the Integrated Communications System &obrack;  commonly known as
the  ' Best Radio System ' &cbrack; , the 999 Emergency Services Telephone system and
the Enhanced Computer-assisted Command and Control System &obrack;  ECACCS &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#13:1>
The ECACCS comprises a back-end computer-aided dispatch system
with front-end console terminals installed at the three Regional Command and
Control Centres &obrack;  RCCCs &cbrack; and local police stations to support controllers in
resource deployment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#14:1>
Details of all incidents reported through the Best Radio System , the
999 Sub-system or at HKPF stations are input into ECACCS , which then
verifies the location and automatically routes the information to the
relevant divisional console for deployment of resources . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#15:1>
ECACCS provides computer service coverage for both routine
policing as well as internal security and major incidents .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#16:1>
It has interfaces with the enhanced Police Operation Nominal Index
Computer System &obrack;  EPONICS &cbrack; and the Transport Department  ' s Vehicle and
Licensing Identification System &obrack;  VALID &cbrack; , as well as restricted access to
the Immigration Department  ' s Registration of Persons System &obrack;  ROPS &cbrack; ,
providing information on wanted and missing persons and vehicles of interest .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#17:1>
CC2 will reach the end of its useful life by the end of 2004 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#18:1>
A provision of HK&dollar;948 million was approved in June 2001 for
acquiring a new Third Generation and Control Communications System &obrack;  CC3 &cbrack; to
replace it . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#19:1>
New features and major benefits </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#20:1>
CC3 will be an integrated command and control system with the
latest communications and computer technologies .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#21:1>
The new digital radio infrastructure will be built to open standards
and be capable of further expansion without the need for major changes and
upgrades .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#22:1>
It will provide comprehensive radio coverage , both in terms of
cross-communication amongst front-line officers of different formations and
areas covered .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#23:1>
Furthermore , its digitised , highly authenticated and encrypted air-
interface will greatly enhance protection against eavesdropping and
unauthorized access .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#24:1>
It will not be possible for media reporters to tune into a police
radio channel . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#25:1>
The new system will have data channels to allow transmission of
not only voice but also data and images .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#26:1>
Its new digitised , encrypted transmission platform will greatly
enhance protection against eavesdropping and unauthorised access .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#27:1>
A Geographical Information System &obrack;  GIS &cbrack; with electronic mapping ,
plotting of incidents/ places of HKPF interest will be installed to
facilitate the plotting of scenes of crimes and incidents on digitised maps
in the RCCCs . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#28:1>
CC3 will also employ Automatic Vehicle Location System &obrack;  AVLS)
which , being integrated with the GIS , will enable the RCCCs to track the
location of police emergency response vehicles , to improve their rapid
deployment to scenes of incidents .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#29:1>
This will facilitate more flexible and efficient deployment of
resources and faster tactical response to incidents . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#30:1>
CC3 is not only a digital radio infrastructure to open standard
which allows an incremental approach to future system enhancement; it is also
the most cost-effective and scalable platform for public services
organisations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#31:1>
In the long run , it will be developed as a common radio platform
shared by disciplinary agencies and government departments .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#32:1>
For everyday usage , each agency will have a section of the platform
for its exclusive use with absolute security .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#33:1>
Each agency can independently manage its own subscribers and dynamic
talkgroups , and define its own communication and administrative operations
automatically like a Virtual Private Network &obrack;  VPN &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#34:1>
During emergencies , rescue and disaster situations , the entire
platform can be programmed to facilitate inter-operability amongst various
agencies and centralised command as well as effective and efficient control
or deployment of resources . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#35:1>
The lessons of the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US
taught us that we could not prevent all crime or untoward incidents from
occurring .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#36:1>
We can however in my view achieve the next best thing through the
greater use of advanced wireless communications technology to provide a
prompt , firm , effective and professional response to those crimes and
events . </p> <h> <bold> Improved public service </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#37:1>
The new system will improve police services to the public in the
following ways - &obrack;  a &cbrack; CC3 will allow direct access to various information
systems containing information on wanted or missing persons , stolen vehicles
, crime reports and forged ID cards .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#38:1>
Such functionality will greatly improve the utilisation and
efficiency of the new communications system and enhance the quality of
service provided by HKPF .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#39:1>
For example , ID checks will be conducted directly through data
transfer from Mobile Data Terminals &obrack;  MDT &cbrack; installed at police emergency
response vehicles and beat radios instead of RCCC operators , as is currently
the case .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#40:1>
It is expected that the average time required for such a check will
be reduced by 10 to 15 seconds .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#41:1>
As a result , radio channels and RCCC operators will be freed up for
voice communications of high priority and other urgent tasks; &obrack;  b &cbrack; With the
provision of new MDTs , police emergency response vehicles can effectively
function as mobile reporting centers for members of the public to make
reports on the spot; &obrack;  c &cbrack; The new 999 Sun-system will provide a speedier
response to emergency calls by showing details of the caller  ' s number and
address .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#42:1>
It will also incorporate additional call takers in each RCCC to deal
with sudden surges; and &obrack;  d &cbrack; Serving as an integrated communications platform
for beat patrol officers and patrols officers deployed to the Traffic Branch
, PTU and EU , the new system will improve communications between front-line
officers and facilitate the efficient and effective deployment of resources
during emergencies and large-scale operations . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#43:1>
A global tender for CC3 was issued on 1 February 2002 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#44:1>
The new CC3 system is expected to go live in three phases: 3rd
quarter 2004 for New Territories 4th quarter 2004 for Hong Kong Island 
1st quarter 2006 for Kowloon </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#46:1>
At the 3rd TETRA World Congress in Nice , France , in December
last year HKPF shared with delegates its first-mover experience in TETRA &obrack; 
Terrestrial Trunked Radio &cbrack; technology in the Marine Police  ' s communication
system .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#47:1>
I made a presentation at the Congress covering the reasons for using
TETRA , an open digital radio standard laid down in 1994 , and what we have
learnt from the TETRA system and the CC3 project , which will also utilize
TETRA technology . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#48:1>
Representatives of many industrialized countries were very
surprised at the speedy and advanced development of the communications system
by the Force and were particularly interested in our approach to the many
technical challenges . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#49:1>
More than 900 delegates attended the congress to discuss issues
affecting TETRA projects in the UK , Belgium , Holland and Germany , the
success of which will greatly facilitate police radio communications in
Europe . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#50:1>
The HKPF won the Most Innocative TETRA Service Award for the
Automatic Vessel Location and Messaging System used by the Marine Police at
the congress for its innovative use of IP &obrack;  Internet Protocol &cbrack; over the TETRA
network to transmit data . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#51:1>
The system , believed to be the most advanced of its kind in the
world , beat off stiff competition from police systems in Western Australia
and the UK .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#52:1>
TETRA primarily handles voice transmission , but the network is also
used to transmit IP data .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#53:1>
This new approach provides continuous and accurate position updates
of Marine Police launches .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#54:1>
Users can also send word documents and photographs via the radio
network . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#55:1>
The congress gave HKPF an opportunity to share its knowledge and
present itself as a recognized user of advanced communications for police
services . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#56:1>
Our Commissioner Tang Yam-pui pkedged in a  ' Letter to Hong Kong'
broadcast on RTHK Radio 3 earlier this year that the Force would continue to
improve its equipment and quality of service .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#57:1>
Enabling technology will have a big role to play in the fulfillment
of this pledge .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#58:1>
HKPF will endeavour to build the very best computer and
communications system in line with global developments and , in some areas ,
become a world leader . </p> <it>

Processing utilities information on the Internet </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#62:1>
Everybody in Hong Kong is familiar with the nuisance of road
excavations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#63:1>
The noise , the dust , the traffic jams and , worst of all , the poor
planning of such works that often leads to repeated disruptions on the same
roads . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#64:1>
Help is at hand . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#65:1>
The University of Hong Kong  ' s Jockey Club Research &ampersand; Information
Centre for Landslip Prevention &ampersand; Land Development has come up with a system
called the Electronic Mark Plant Query System &obrack;  EMPQS &cbrack; to facilitate the
processing of information on underground utilities . </p> <O> Picture </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#66:1>
According to the university , the system provides a one-step
service for collecting utility services information via secure electronic
means .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#67:1>
It allows such information collection to be completed in seven
working days instead of the 21 days it currently takes using manual means .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#68:1>
The system is said to be fast , secure , environmentally friendly and
cost-effective; it is estimated that the EMPQS can reduce operation costs by
90&percent; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#69:1>
Following registration , users will be able to use the system to
obtain information on underground utilities at a specific location from the
relevant utility operators .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#70:1>
The system functions in a coordinating role by providing a platform
for the exchange of information between those carrying out roadworks and
utility operators .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#71:1>
To ensure security , the system uses a Secure Socket Layer for data
transmission and digital certificates for data authentication .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#72:1>
There is also a firewall to protect the system from outside attacks .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#73:1>
Developed at a cost of HK&dollar;25 million , which was denoted
by the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust , the system has already won the
support of Hong Kong Cable Television Ltd , New T&T Company Ltd , New World
Telephone Ltd and the Transport Department .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#74:1>
The university is hoping to secure other utility operators as
partners . </p>

E-Commerce: Technologies and Perspectives </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#76:2>
Technical 2000 Programme Chairman Ir Jolly Wong , who chaired a
panel discussion at the Asia-Pacific Electronic Symposium , share his and
other expert  ' s observations on new e-commerce technologies and their impact .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#77:2>
With global Internet traffic doubling every three months and more
and more demand for broadband , communications via optical network - which
allows the transmission of data , video and voice in the form of light over
glass , instead of electrons over copper - is becoming the choice for telecom
companies . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#78:2>
At the Asia-Pacific Electronic Symposium 2000 Panel Discussion ,
Charles Mok , Chairman of the Hong Kong Internet Service Providers &obrack;  HKISP)
Association , spoke about optical networking as the phenomenal trend in the
new economy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#79:2>
&ldquo; Consider this: it takes seven hours to download a movie
over a high-speed cable modem connection now and an how with an Ethernet
connection .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#80:2>
With optical connections , a user can download a movie in just four
seconds , &rdquo; he noted . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#81:2>
Spending on optical networking gears is expected to rocket to
US&dollar;44 billion this year , compared with US&dollar;33 billion last year
, and to rise to US&dollar;89 billion in 2003 , according to market
researchers .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#82:2>
Leading companies in this core enabling technology include: Ciena ,
Corvis , JDS Uniphase , ONI Systems , Nortel Networks and Sycamore Networks .
</p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#83:2>
<bold> The second wave </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#84:2>
After the dotcom meltdown and the ASP hype , people begin to ask
if the second wave of e-commerce business is coming ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#85:2>
As many symposium delegates agreed , Customer Relationship Management
&obrack; CRM &cbrack; system may be the answer as companies make the strategic move from
being produce-oriented to being customer-oriented . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#86:2>
CRM has been used in the old economy for some time: call centre
is a typical part of the CRM solution for many industries .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#87:2>
Sales automation , marketing campaign management and customer
services are the major components of CRM , although they might not be well
integrated in the past .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#88:2>
CRM is not as popular as certain accounting systems in use today
because it is still quite new to many companies . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#89:2>
Thanks to the internet , people have developed new ways of doing
business which transcends boundary and allow them to conduct business without
talking to the customer fact to face .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#90:2>
As a result , a new generation of CRM is required: eCRM , which is a
web-based CRM .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#91:2>
With improvements in wireless technology , eCRM will become more
powerful , especially in the area of sales automation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#92:2>
Successful implementation of eCRM requires the reengineering of a
corporation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#93:2>
In other words , you need to make changes to the management and
create a new culture as well .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#94:2>
For example , how do salesmen usually treat their clients ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#95:2>
Do they treat information as their own property ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#96:2>
Do they disclose 100&percent; information to the company ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#97:2>
It is definitely a challenge to management to ensure the salesforce
is able to meet client requirements; this can be achieved by feeding all
information into the CRM system , thus automating the entire salesforce .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#98:2>
Nowadays there are many players in the market covering CRM , eCRM
and CRA &obrack;  Customer relationship analytic &cbrack; because both the old economy and
the new economy have such needs .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#99:2>
With the strong growth in internet and wireless technologies , CRM
will become one of the high growth area in the IT industry in the coming
years . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#100:2>
<bold> The hype cycle for e-commerce technologies </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#101:2>
On the advancement and focuses of e-commerce technologies , Prof
David Yai of CUHK and Michael Chan , managing vice president of Gartner Group
Hong Kong Ltd used the same model to classify e-commerce technologies into
the following 3 categories: Core Technology &obrack;  for internet/ information
system technology); Business Technology &obrack;  or enterprise solution
technology); Emerging Technology &obrack;  or emerging e-commerce-centric
technology &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#102:2>
Core technology is a technology which enables business
applications .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#103:2>
Java , XML , Smart Card , PKI are all considered core technologies .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#104:2>
Business technology refers to technologies that have direct
impact on day-to-day business .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#105:2>
CRM , Supply Chain Management &obrack;  SCM &cbrack; , Electronic Bill Payment and
Presentation &obrack;  EBPP &cbrack; are some examples . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#106:2>
Emerging technology refers to those technology that are still
under research and development or simply not yet widely commercialised , such
as Bluetooth , WAP , Jini , Voice Portals , etc . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#107:2>
According to Mr Chan , Gartner has developed a Hype Curve for
each technology which provides a snapshot of the position of a set of
technologies in the inevitable cycle of hype and disillusionment that
accompanies a technology path to maturity .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#108:2>
The Hype Curve consists of the following phases: Technology
trigger: A breakthrough , public demonstration , product launch or other
event generates significant press and industry interest .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#109:2>
Peak of inflated expectations: During this phase of
over-enthusiasm and unrealistic projections , a flurry of well-publicised
activity by technology leaders results in some successes but more failures as
the technology is pushed to its limits .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#110:2>
The only enterprises making money are conference organizers and
magazine publishers .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#111:2>
Trough of disillusionment: Because the technology does not live up
to its over-inflated expectations , it rapidly becomes unfashionable and the
press abandons the topic .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#112:2>
Slope of enlightenment: focused experimentation and solid hard
work by an increasingly diverse range of organisations lead to a true
understanding of the technology  ' s applicability , risks and benefits .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#113:2>
Commercial off-the-shelf methodologies and tools become available to
ease the development process .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#114:2>
Plateau of productivity: The real-world benefits of the technology
are demonstrated and accepted .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#115:2>
Tools and methodologies are increasingly stable as they enter their
second and third generation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-040#116:2>
The final height of the plateau varies according to whether the
technology is broadly applicable or benefits only a niche market . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-040#117:2>
&ldquo; The bottom line is: Enterprises should be selectively
aggressive in the early adoption of technologies with the potential for high
impact , but should ride out the Hype Cycle for less-critical technologies ,
&rdquo; Michael Chan said . </p>
</I>
