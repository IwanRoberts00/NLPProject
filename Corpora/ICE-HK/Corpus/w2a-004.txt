<ICE-HK:W2A-004#2:1>
TWO PERSPECTIVES OF CARE : CONFUCIAN <it> <foreign> REN </foreign>
</it> AND FEMINIST <it> CARE </it> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#3:1>
INTRODUCTION </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-004#4:1>
Confucianism and feminism are two important alternative ethical
systems to the rule-based and principle-based approaches to ethics that have
dominated the West in the past decades .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#5:1>
Until quite recently , these two ethics have seldom been brought
together , partly because feminism is a new and fast-developing philosophy
that has always been regarded as inherently antipatriarchal .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#6:1>
Confucianism , on the other hand , is an established traditional
philosophy that has been regarded as typically patriarchal .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#7:1>
But the two ethics share a common emphasis on the moral value of care
and on the central importance of relationship as the basis of morality .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#8:1>
Fruitful comparisons and contrasts can promote critical
self-reflection and self-development of the two ethical systems , and
generate new insights and new challenges to enrich the search for a better
understanding of the nature of morality . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-004#9:1>
In recent years , some comparisons between Confucianism and
feminism have begun to emerge . <sp> <fnr> 1 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#10:1>
But these comparisons have tended to focus more on examining
similarities and establishing common ground rather than on analyzing
differences .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#11:1>
For example , in his article &ldquo; The Confucian Concept of <it>
<foreign> Ren </foreign> </it> and the Feminist Ethics of Care : A
Comparative Study &rdquo; published in <it> Hypatia </it> in 1994 , Chenyang
Li identified three important philosophical common grounds that were claimed
to be shared by feminist <it> care </it> ethics and Confucian ethics of <it>
ren </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#12:1>
These common grounds , according to Li are : &obrack; 1 &cbrack;
common ethical ideals , &obrack; 2 &cbrack; ethics without general principles
, and &obrack; 3 &cbrack; <it> <foreign> ren </foreign> </it> and caring with
gradations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#13:1>
In his most recent book <it> The Tao Encounters The West </it> , Li
basically adhered to his original thesis of shared common grounds between the
two ethics .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#14:1>
I do not dispute that there are significant similarities between the
two ethics .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#15:1>
But in my view , these are at best partial similarities between the
two ethics .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#16:1>
I do not dispute that there are significant similarities between the
two ethics .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#17:1>
But in my view , these are at best partial similarities .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#18:1>
I contend that there are in fact deep and important differences
underlying these partial similarities .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#19:1>
I therefore propose to take a different route in this article to
focus on an examination of their fundamental differences to deepen our
understanding of the two ethics .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#20:1>
The intention is not to show which provides a more correct or
superior account of care .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#21:1>
Rather , an examination of differences between the two ethics of care
can be immensely useful for purposes of mutual self-critique , mutual
self-enrichment , and mutual self-development .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#22:1>
Recognizing their differences and similarities will offer important
insights to expand our understanding of the nature of morality and moral
reasoning . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-004#23:1>
I will start by highlighting some of the key observations that
have led to the claim that there are three shared common grounds between the
two systems as identified by Li .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#24:1>
I will then argue on the basis of countervailing textual evidences
that these are only partial similarities .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#25:1>
I will also analyze some foundational differences between the two
systems and argue how these foundational differences underpin two distinct
perspectives of care in Confucianism and feminism , based on different
conceptions of the ideal of care , different attitudes toward the role of
principles in moral reasoning and different understandings of the limits of
moral obligations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#26:1>
I will conclude by using two well-known Confucian case examples of
moral dilemmas to illuminate the insights that a Confucian perspective of
care can offer to expand understanding and development of care ethics on the
one hand , and to current wider debates on the nature of moral reasoning ,
moral judgement , and moral obligations on the other . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-004#27:1>
It should be noted that Confucianism is not a single unitary
discourse .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#28:1>
This analysis is focused on the discourses of Confucius himself
&obrack; 551-479 B.C. &cbrack; and Mencius &obrack; 371-289 B.C. ? &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#29:1>
Likewise , care ethics is not the only feminist ethics , nor is there
a uniform theory of feminist care ethics .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#30:1>
The discussion of feminist care ethics in this article is primarily
focused on the writings of Carol Gilligan and Nel Noddings , although there
are occasional references to other feminist philosophers who have further
developed and expanded feminist care ethics . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-004#31:1>
It is also important to note that in the translations of the
classical texts quoted in this paper , the Chinese character for the common
noun &ldquo; <mention> people </mention> , &rdquo; which is nongendered , has
come to be translated as &ldquo; <mention> men </mention> &rdquo; in all the
translations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#32:1>
Likewise , the Chinese character for the common noun <it> <foreign>
<mention> junzi </mention> </foreign> </it> &obrack; the morally cultivated
person &cbrack; has come to be translated as &ldquo; <mention> gentlemen
</mention> . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#33:1>
I also wish to point out that the words &ldquo; <mention> heart
</mention> &rdquo; and &ldquo; <mention> mind </mention> &rdquo; are used
interchangeably by the Confucians &dash; the organ that feels and judges is
one and the same organ . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#34:1>
COMMON GROUND BETWEEN CONFUCIAN ETHICS OF <it> <foreign> REN
</foreign> </it> AND FEMINIST ETHICS OF CARE </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#35:1>
<it> Common Ethical Ideals </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-004#36:1>
It has been suggested that Confucian ethics share a common moral
point of departure in their acceptance of a noncontractual conception of
society and in their acknowledgement of human relations rather than
individual rights as the basis of morality . <sp> <fnr> 2 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#37:1>
Contrary to mainstream liberal thinking , they do not perceive
society as arising out of an agreement made among rational and independent
contractors for mutual gains and peaceful existence .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#38:1>
In a contractual society , moral understanding is based on the
concept of individual rights .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#39:1>
In the Confucian and feminist conceptions , they both place a high
moral value on relatedness , obligation , and concern for others in their
ethics .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#40:1>
This leads to the claim that they also share a similar moral ideal
that is captured by the concept of care in the feminist perspective and by
the concept of <it> <foreign> ren </foreign> </it> in the Confucian
perspective .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#41:1>
The common thread linking these two ideals of care and <it> <foreign>
ren </foreign> </it> is <it> caring </it> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-004#42:1>
Indeed , the Chinese character for <it> <foreign> ren </foreign>
</it> does in fact consist of a simple ideogram of a human figure and two
horizontal strokes suggesting human relations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#43:1>
It has been translated by many terms including benevolence , love ,
altruism , kindness , charity , compassion , perfect virtue , goodness , etc .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#44:1>
It is also true that the Confucian account locates the value of
caring and the responsibility to care in the virtue of <it> <foreign> ren
</foreign> </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#45:1>
Similar to the feminist perspective , in the Confucian account , care
is understood as a form of altruistic regard .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#46:1>
It is both disposition and practice .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#47:1>
It involves being attentive to another  ' s well-being and being
willing to act to promote it .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#48:1>
The Confucian account shares with the feminist perspective the notion
that the concept of care implies action and assumption of responsibility .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#49:1>
It goes beyond an attitude of mere concern and respect and directs
attention to action .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#50:1>
However , although the concept of <it> <foreign> ren </foreign> </it>
has appeared as many as 105 times in the <it> Analects </it> , the collected
sayings of Confucius , it was not once defined formally by Confucius himself .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#51:1>
Each time Confucius or Mencius was asked to explain <it> <foreign>
ren </foreign> </it> , they gave a slight different answer , including the
following : </p> <X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#X52:1>
Ren is to love people . &obrack; Analects 12:22 &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#X53:1>
Love all men comprehensively . &obrack; Analects 1:6 &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#X54:1>
A person of ren embraces all in his love . &obrack; Mencius 7A:46
&cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#X55:1>
The person of ren loves others . &obrack; Mencius 4B:28 &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#X56:1>
Loving one  ' s parents is ren . &obrack; Mencius 7A:15 &cbrack; </X>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-004#57:1>
Although the concept was never defined formally , it is clear on
the basis of these answers that the central notion of <it> <foreign> ren
</foreign> </it> is &lsquo; love &rsquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#58:1>
It is the key moral concept that guides human relations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#59:1>
The concept has two senses . <sp> <fnr> 3 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#60:1>
As a particular virtue , <it> <foreign> ren </foreign> </it> refers
to the virtues of benevolence and altruistic concern for others .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#61:1>
As a general virtue , <it> <foreign> ren </foreign> </it> stands for
perfect virtue , goodness or moral perfection .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#62:1>
<it> <foreign> Ren </foreign> </it> in the general sense , provides
the overarching , unifying ethical framework in Confucian ethics .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#63:1>
It encompasses all the other particular virtues , such as benevolence
, propriety , courage , filial piety , and loyalty .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#64:1>
For example , Confucius expressly said that without <it> <foreign>
ren </foreign> </it> , the virtue of following propriety &obrack; <it>
<foreign> li </foreign> </it> &cbrack; is meaningless . <sp> <fnr> 4 </fnr>
</sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#65:1>
He also said that &ldquo; A person of <it> <foreign> ren </foreign>
</it> will certainly also possess courage , but a brave person is not
necessarily <it> <foreign> ren </foreign> </it> . &rdquo; <sp> <fnr> 5 </fnr>
</sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-004#66:1>
<it> <foreign> Ren </foreign> </it> , as a prefect virtue ,
underlies all virtuous behaviors .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#67:1>
It is the virtue of virtues .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#68:1>
It enables us to make distinction between mere rashness and genuine
courage .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#69:1>
It imbues the other virtues with meaning .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#70:1>
The other virtues derive their ethical import either directly or
indirectly from the cardinal virtue of <it> <foreign> ren </foreign> </it> .
<sp> <fnr> 6 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#71:1>
This does not mean , however , that these various particular virtues
are actually collapsed into the cardinal virtue of <it> <foreign> ren
</foreign> </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#72:1>
But it does mean that these various particular virtues are
appreciated only to the extent that they are related to and are guided by the
general virtue of <it> <foreign> ren </foreign> </it> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-004#73:1>
As a general virtue , <it> <foreign> ren </foreign> </it> is the
highest ethical ideal , the apex of moral achievement by the ideal moral
character .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#74:1>
By the same token , the ideal moral character in Confucian ethics is
&ldquo; a person of <it> <foreign> Ren </foreign> </it> &ldquo; who is a
morally perfect person .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#75:1>
This also means that a person who has <it> <foreign> ren </foreign>
</it> as a general virtue must also have <it> <foreign> ren </foreign> </it>
as a particular virtue .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#76:1>
This double character of <it> <foreign> ren </foreign> </it> as an
ethical ideal is a defining feature of Confucian ethics . <sp> <fnr> 7 </fnr>
</sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-004#77:1>
In the Confucian account , the source of <it> <foreign> ren
</foreign> </it> is located in the natural &ldquo; heart sensitive to the
sufferings of others &rdquo; which all humans possess .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#78:1>
Mencius substantiated the claim in the following way : </p> <X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#X79:1>
<quote> No man is devoid of a heart sensitive to the suffering of
others .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#X80:1>
When I say that all men have a mind which cannot bear to see the
sufferings of other , my meaning may be illustrated thus : suppose a man were
all of a sudden to see a child about to fall into a well .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#X81:1>
He will without exception experience a feeling of alarm and distress .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#X82:1>
He will feel as so , not because he wants to gain the favor of the
child  ' s parents , nor to seek the praise of their neighbors and friends ,
nor from a dislike of the cry of the child .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#X83:1>
The heart of compassion is the seed of ren . 8 </quote> </X>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-004#84:1>
Mencius explained human capacity for altruistic regard in terms
of natural feelings of sympathy and compassion that arise in one  ' s heart
when suffering is being witnessed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#85:1>
He did not make any appeal to external transcendental sources or any
sorts of consequentialist , utilitarian considerations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#86:1>
Such a grounding makes Confucian ethics a secular ethics with a
nonconsequentialist orientation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#87:1>
As illustrated in Mencius  ' s example of the man near the well , the
compassion is a response to the imminent danger faced by the child and not
based on any motive to gain favor or praise or to fulfill some personal likes
or dislikes in the man himself .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#88:1>
The Confucian ideal is to be able to extend this feeling to other
things in the world and thus make it a general disposition because the
Confucians believe that &ldquo; for every man there are things he cannot bear .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#89:1>
To extend this to what he can bear is <it> <foreign> ren </foreign>
</it> . &rdquo; <sp> <fnr> 9 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#90:1>
A person of <it> <foreign> ren </foreign> </it> is therefore someone
who is able to take this natural feeling of sympathy and extend it from
&ldquo; things he cannot bear &rdquo; to &ldquo; things he can bear . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#91:1>
Because the feelings of sympathy and compassion are natural feelings
that arise in one  ' s heart when suffering is being witnessed , Confucius said
, &ldquo; <it> <foreign> Ren </foreign> </it> can only come from the self
&dash; how could it come from others ? &rdquo; <sp> <fnr> 10 </fnr> </sp>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-004#92:1>
In the feminist perspective , the apex of morality is also caring .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#93:1>
It has been suggested that a similar structure can be found in
Noddings  '  formulation of feminist care ethics in which she identifies caring
as the highest ideal and locates the source of caring in two sentiments :
natural caring and ethical caring . <sp> <fnr> 11 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#94:1>
According to Noddings , the sentiment of natural caring is the
initial , enabling sentiment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#95:1>
The second sentiment occurs in response to a remembrance of the first .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#96:1>
It arises out of this memory of our own best moments of caring and
being cared for which sweeps over us as a feeling &dash; as an &ldquo; I must
&rdquo; &dash; in response to the plight of the other . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-004#97:1>
According to Noddings , I am closest to goodness when I accept
and affirm the internal &ldquo; I must . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#98:1>
This goodness is felt and it guides thinking implicitly .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#99:1>
We remember having been cared for when we were young , and it is this
warm , pleasant memory that leads us to long for goodness and motivates us to
care for others .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#100:1>
The desire to act well is rooted in the desire to return to this
state .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#101:1>
As Noddings explains , &ldquo; It is this ethical ideal &obrack;
caring &cbrack; , this realistic picture of ourselves as one-caring , that
guides us as we strive to meet the other morally . &rdquo; <sp> <fnr> 12
</fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#102:1>
The ideal self as one-caring and cared for is closest to goodness ,
which is the natural state of caring .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#103:1>
Thus when we commit ourselves to obey the &ldquo; I must, &rdquo; we
are under the guidance of the ethical ideal , that vision of the best self .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-004#104:1>
The women interviewees in Carol Gilligan  ' s <it> In a Different
Voice </it> all agreed that morality centers on care . <sp> <fnr> 13 </fnr>
</sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#105:1>
Noddings also argues that &ldquo; caring is important in itself
&rdquo; <sp> <fnr> 14 </fnr> </sp> because in her view , &ldquo; <quote> This
value itself arises as a product of actual caring and being cared-for and my
reflection on the goodness of these concrete caring situations </quote> .
&rdquo; <sp> <fnr> 15 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#106:1>
Her formulation of the ethics of caring locates morality primarily
in the pre-act consciousness of the one-caring . <sp> <fnr> 16 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#107:1>
It is disinterested concern and the subsequent
will/action/disposition to promote the welfare of the cared-for which are the
defining elements of the care ethics . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-004#108:1>
The analysis thus far seems to lend support to the claim that an
important common ground shared by Confucian and feminist ethics is that the
practice of caring is essential in both ethics for a person to become a moral
person .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#109:1>
They also seem to share a similar nonconsequentialist orientation ,
a similar emphasis on relationship as the basis of morality and on caring as
the highest ethical ideal .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#110:1>
There also seems to be good reasons for supporting the observation
that &ldquo; As the highest moral ideals , <it> <foreign> Ren </foreign>
</it> and Care are good in themselves . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#111:1>
&ldquo; They are not to be justified in terms of the consequences
they bring about , though the consequences are generally desirable . &rdquo;
<sp> <fnr> 17 </fnr> </sp> </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#112:1>
<it> Ethics without General Principles </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-004#113:1>
Because both Confucian ethics and feminist ethics emphasize
particular relationships and caring , this has led to the observation that
the two ethics have little room for general principles and no room for
impartial morality .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#114:1>
This is considered to be one of the distinctive characteristics of
the two ethics which marks them off from prevalent models in Western
philosophy , where it is widely accepted that general principles serve to
guide moral conduct and decisions , and impartiality is the standard and
foundation of morality . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-004#115:1>
Indeed , Noddings herself has expressly stated that &ldquo;
<quote> The one-caring is wary of rules and principles . </quote> &rdquo;
<sp> <fnr> 18 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#116:1>
This is because in her view , </p> <quote> Ethical caring depends
upon not rules or principles but upon the development of an ideal self &dash;
the ideal developed in congruence with one  ' s best remembrance of caring and
being cared-for . <X> The ethical ideal is the guide to ethical conduct , not
rule or principle .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#X117:1>
The reasons are based upon ethical ideal rather than universal
principle . 19 </quote> </X>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-004#118:1>
Gilligan  ' s understanding of the care perspective is also
nonprincipled and therefore nonuniversalizable .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#119:1>
Gilligan has expressly said that her aim is &ldquo; to turn the tide
of moral discussion from questions of how to achieve objectivity and
detachment to how to engage responsively and with care . &rdquo; <sp> <fnr>
20 </fnr> </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-004#120:1>
In her formulation of care ethics , Noddings also makes it very
clear that it &ldquo; will not embody a set of universalizable moral
judgements . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#121:1>
&ldquo; Indeed, &rdquo; as Nodding confirms , &ldquo; moral
judgement will not be its central concern . &rdquo; <sp> <fnr> 21 </fnr>
</sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#122:1>
The central concern of morality , from the feminist care perspective
, is to heighten moral perception and sensitivity instead .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#123:1>
The belief is that the morality of a decision does not lie in its
possible generalizability or applicability to other situations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#124:1>
The primary criteria to guide moral reasoning and decision making
should be care and sympathy .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#125:1>
Ethical behaviour is guided by the ethical ideal of caring and not
by principles or rules .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#126:1>
The central question to ask is not about moral judgement but about
moral attitude . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-004#127:1>
In comparing Confucianism with feminist care ethics , Li made
the point that likewise , &ldquo; <quote> rules are not an essential feature
of Confucian morality . </quote> &rdquo; <sp> <fnr> 22 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#128:1>
For example , as mentioned earlier , although Confucius talked many
times about how to become a person of <it> <foreign> ren </foreign> </it> ,
he never gave a general guideline .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#129:1>
Each time , the answer was something different .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#130:1>
Confucius seems to imply that <it> <foreign> ren </foreign> </it>
cannot be achieved by following general principles . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-004#131:1>
Mencius himself also made the observation that three ancient
sages in Chinese history &dash; <it> <foreign> Po Yi </foreign> </it> , <it>
<foreign> Yi Yin </foreign> </it> , and <it> <foreign> Liu Xiahui </foreign>
</it> &dash; &ldquo; all followed different paths , but their goal was one .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#132:1>
What is meant by &lsquo; <mention> one </mention> &rsquo; ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#133:1>
The answer is &lsquo; <it> <foreign> ren </foreign> </it> . &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#134:1>
All that is to be expected of a gentleman is &lsquo; <it> <foreign>
ren </foreign> </it> . &rsquo; &rdquo; <sp> <fnr> 23 </fnr> </sp>

It is very clear that Mencius is arguing that there can be only one
absolute standard of measure for humankind and this is the standard of <it>
<foreign> ren </foreign> </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#136:1>
But there can be many ways to attain this standard and they could
vary with different individuals . </p>

Mencius further said , &ldquo; <quote> A gentleman needs not
keep his word nor does he necessarily see his action through to the end . <X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#X138:1>
He aims only at what is right &obrack; appropriate &cbrack; .
&rdquo; </quote> </X> <sp> <fnr> 24 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#139:1>
Mencius  ' s claim here clearly is that general principles do not
always determine what is appropriate and that a person of <it> <foreign> ren
</foreign> </it> is one with good judgement who knows what to do and when .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#140:1>
This echoed the earlier point from Confucius that &ldquo; <it>
<foreign> Ren </foreign> </it> can only come from the self &dash; how could
it come from others ? &rdquo; <sp> <fnr> 25 </fnr> </sp> </p>

These observations seem to support the view that indeed both the
Confucian and the feminist care ethics can be characterized as ethics without
general principles .

<ICE-HK:W2A-004#142:1>
In both ethics , there seems to be an absence of universal rules or
general principles , an insistence that rules are not absolute and overriding
, and an emphasis on moral sensitivity over principles and moral reasoning .
