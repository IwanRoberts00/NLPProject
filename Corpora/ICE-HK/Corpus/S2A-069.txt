May I please you My Lord

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#2:1:A>
Uh My Lordship you have before you uhm my uhm written submission and
My Lord should have a uhm plaintiff  ' s uh bundle of of authorities uh on on
your right hand side My Lord

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#3:1:A>
Uhm My Lord if I could just quickly uhm sort of break into that  ' s
page one of my submission and if I could skip the first paragraph
introductory paragraph

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#4:1:A>
My Lord uhm paragraph two the fourth line <quote> Although the First
Defendant was prepared to sell the premises he pleaded his pleaded case being
and indeed conformed at the first day of the hearing that he was not liable
under the provisional sale and purchase agreement and the Third Defendant has
failed to carry out the certificate instructions in getting the consent of
the Second Defendant being uh before signing </quote>

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#5:1:A>
My Lord and I  ' m now on page two

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#6:1:A>
My Lord uh a very quick summary as to matters which are not in
dispute

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#7:1:A>
My Lord uhm the First and Second Defendants being tenants in common

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#8:1:A>
Uh the First Defendant had engaged the Third Defendant as an agent
to check the market price and had handled potential purchasers of the uh uh
of of the property including uh taking clients to view the property and the
First Defendant uh did indeed give the key to the Third Defendant

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#9:1:A>
On the twentieth eighth of August uh the Third Defendant signed on
behalf of the First Defendant as well as the Second Defendant with uh with
the plaintiff a a provisional agreement

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#10:1:A>
My My Lord these are not in dispute

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#11:1:A>
It  ' s stipulated in the agreement that the Third Defendant signed
on behalf of both both D one and D two

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#12:1:A>
On the twentieth eighth as prior to the signing uh D three had made
telephone contact with both D one and D two

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#13:1:A>
<.> M </.> My Lord the matters that are in dispute whether the
First Second Defendant consented to engaging the Third Defendant and it  ' s
merely for the limited propose of checking the market price and had not
empowered the Third Defendant to act as an agent for for the sale

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#14:1:A>
Whether the Second Defendant had agreed to sell the property and uh
whether the Third Defendant had failed to obtain consent form the Second
Defendant to sell on the on the twentieth eighth of <.> Au </.> August D
three confirmed uh with Third Defendant that her intention to sell at one
point nine three eight million and also authorized D three to sign on her
behalf

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#15:1:A>
My Lord uhm the Third Defendant appointed to sell and signed on
behalf of both uh First and the Second Defendant

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#16:1:A>
My Lord it is the Second Defendant  ' s case that he never authorized
the Third Defendant to sell on his behalf

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#17:1:A>
There has never been any direct authorization from uh D two to D
three

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#18:1:A>
Second Defendant only authorize the First Defendant just to check
the market price at the said premises

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#19:1:A>
D two further gave uh evidence that since he moved into the
premises in uh late June ninety one he had no no intention to sell at all for
any price

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#20:1:A>
He was happy uh living there and had spent a lot of money on
decorations

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#21:1:A>
My Lord in respect of the Defendant  ' s intention to sell My Lord I
respectfully submit it is more probable that the First and Second Defendant
when originally purchased uh the Happy Valley premises intended uh that it
ought it was to be resold uh uhm but decided to move in when they could not
sell

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#22:1:A>
My Lord I say this uhm because uh there there threre  ' s of the uh
inference from the five months <.> du </.> duration between the <.> d </.>
delivery of the property and the time they actually moved in

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#23:1:A>
Uh D one and D two being interested in Hong Kong property market
would have the just the prospect of selling the Happy Valley flat

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#24:1:A>
D one had raised the topic in numerous occasions

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#25:1:A>
It is incredible that the Second Defendant would not have discussed
the prospect of sale with the First Defendant

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#26:1:A>
Or if he was not keen to sell at all it was incredible that D two
would not have informed D D one of his intention

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#27:1:A>
Uh this is especially so when D one and D two had known each other
for twenty years

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#28:1:A>
Uh it  ' s incredible when realizing D one was keen to sell but D two
would have let him waste his time and effort and give him false hope of there
being any prospect of sale

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#29:1:A>
Further D two admits he had a general idea as to how much the
market price of the property was

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#30:1:A>
To instruct D three was to get the exact market price

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#31:1:A>
Had he no intention intention to sell <.> whatsoe ever </.> there
was no intension for him to instruct D three to check the exact market price

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#32:1:A>
Uhm D two in his statement states that D three had in some social
occasions informed him as to the price of the property uh that indicate My
Lord uh there was no reason why he would not have terminated his said
instruction thereafter

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#33:1:A>
As far as he was concerned that D three could offer no further
assistance to him

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#34:1:A>
Uh and D one  ' s statement D one evidence stands for appeared uh to
support D two case that D two <.> ex </.> extension of authority to D three
was only limited to price checking

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#35:1:A>
My Lord <.> how </.> however one important piece of his evidence in
his statement being in about August <quote> I together with Second Defendant
specifically authorised the Third Defendant to sell the premises on our
behalf at the price of one point nine seven million </quote>

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#36:1:A>
D one had not given any reasonable explanation as stated in the
statement

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#37:1:A>
And it  ' s incredible that uh uh had D two only consented to price
checking uh the witness statement should have been complied in an <.> un a a
a </.> unambiguous form and My Lord it should be D one uh would have put this
signature to it

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#38:1:A>
D one and D two have known each other for twenty years

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#39:1:A>
Known each other well enough to agree to live under the same roof

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#40:1:A>
There had been plenty of opportunities to discuss the matter

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#41:1:A>
Both were interested in <.> proper mar </.> property market so
naturally it is incredible that D one who was so keen to sell would not have
been enquired from D two whether D two was willing to sell and what price D
two would have been willing to sell at

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#42:1:A>
As he knew well he could not have sold without D two consent

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#43:1:A>
My Lord it is also incredible that D one would not have informed D
two when passing on keys to D three

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#44:1:A>
And My My Lord uh the agent uh could not forewarning D two to put
away valuables and beware of possible inconvenience caused

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#45:1:A>
It is improbable that D one could have come to a figure one point
nine seven million when instructing D three to sell

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#46:1:A>
D one must have had some ideas to what region if not the exact
figure would have been acceptable to D two

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#47:1:A>
My Lord it is incredible that the First Defendant would have
engaged the Third Defendant and agreed to uh award her one per cent in the
event of a successful sale sale without the discussing it with D two

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#48:1:A>
This is especially so when D two was to bear half the commission
something that D two had consented to instruct D three with a view to sell

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#49:1:A>
My Lord we note that uh the vendor kept paying agency fee is is
rather unusual in in the uh in the Hong Kong property market

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#50:1:A>
Uhm My Lord had had there been such an arrangement one would have
thought that that it ought to be made clear to <.> a </.> any co-owners

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#51:1:A>
My Lord uh D three when signing <,> when sign My My Lord I  ' m into
the territory of why would D three uh signed without the authority

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#52:1:A>
Paragraph fifteen <quote> D three when signed the agreement would
have known full well that the consequence of signing without D two  ' s
authority </quote>

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#53:1:A>
She was only that to get the commission of nineteen uh thousand and
four hundred dollars

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#54:1:A>
It was not a matter of extreme urgency

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#55:1:A>
There was no pressure from the plaintiff uh for the <,> for the
Third Defendant to give her an answer on uh twentieth eighth uh of August

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#56:1:A>
D two was only a phone call away

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#57:1:A>
If it was the case then D D the Second Defendant had not responded
in the first contact

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#58:1:A>
D three could have tried <unc> two words </unc> to contact
D two

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#59:1:A>
That D two had not responded

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#60:1:A>
There  ' s no apparent reason why D three when subsequently phoning D
one would not have informed him that she could not get an answer from her D
two

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#61:1:A>
In short My Lord there is no apparent reason why D three would
entered into the contact without the authority of D two

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#62:1:A>
Especially when she had taken the trouble to seek My Lord hereto
the view on that day

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#63:1:A>
And uh D one had specifically told her to obtain D two  ' s consent

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#64:1:A>
My Lord I respectfully submit that D two version is less probable
in that he was made aware from D one that on the twentieth that someone
wanted to buy his flat

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#65:1:A>
He made no enquiry as to a offered price despite his intention to
sell come what may uh My Lord despite there  ' s no intention to sell come what
may

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#66:1:A>
Uh he made uh note that rejection uh uh what contradict contrary to
the previous attitude being checking the price was merely a business between
D one and D three

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#67:1:A>
He was not to get involved in any sale

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#68:1:A>
But My Lord on the twentieth eighth of August did he not even
attempt to stop D two from asking D three to call him back

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#69:1:A>
My Lord uh one would have thought that if he want to uh want to uh
avoid getting into the picture he he could simply tell uh D D one to forget
it

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#70:1:A>
There  ' s no need to ask D three to contact any any further

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#71:1:A>
My Lord further it is not likely D two uh had had many properties
and that this was only one of them

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#72:1:A>
Uh D two was dealing with the property that he was residing in and
evidence being that that was the only property under his name at that time

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#73:1:A>
D two was aware of D D one intention to sell as D one had mentioned
to him almost every few days <,> uh since they moved in

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#74:1:A>
Yet accepted that there could have been a prospect form D one only
selling his share

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#75:1:A>
It is improbable that D two could have maintained his won't
careless attitude

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#76:1:A>
And this is especially so when he take his order of viewing other
properties but not even bother to make the return uh call to either D one or
D three when you uh <?> knew </?> well there was a firm offered on the
twentieth eight

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#77:1:A>
Submitted it is incredible that D two could have been entirely
uninterested in the progress not even interested in the asking price

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#78:1:A>
Even if his mobile ran out of batteries he could phone uh D two D
three at a regular phone before he went to Radio Hong Kong after the meeting
in Radio Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#79:1:A>
I submit on uh balance the reason why why there were no further
attempt for D two to contact D three or vice versa uh being there was
expressed consent from D two uh for for D three to sign on sign on his behalf

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#80:1:A>
Uh and the rest was left uh to be worked out with the uh the First
Defendant and the plaintiff

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#81:1:A>
My Lord uh in respect of the sale of the flat with meagre furniture
uh D two stated that D one was to move out of the property

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#82:1:A>
Uh it would be interesting to note that who who had the ownership
of the property and furnishing

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#83:1:A>
My Lord notes that he had fifty percent of some <unc> two words
</unc> uh specific instruction would have been required in order to be in
position to confirm the items uh that were to to go the exact uh My Lord
would note that the uh uh uh list of furnishing was an extensive list

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#84:1:A>
And it is improbable that D one alone <.> wou </.> would be in the
position to confirm the sale of the uh furnishing without the prior of
approval or consent of D two

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#85:1:A>
Submit D one must have at some stage prior to his giving consent
uhm discussing matter with D two

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#86:1:A>
My Lord uh the significance of the uh date of completion being two
months away in that uh D D three states that it was upon his instructions of
D two that the date of completion was to be two months away

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#87:1:A>
D one confirmed that D three had informed him on twentieth eight uh
of August

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#88:1:A>
There is no suggestion that her proposal had come from anyone other
than D two

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#89:1:A>
D one was was anxious to sell

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#90:1:A>
Uh the plaintiff had no problems in making down- payment and and
<,> uh uh D three had no interest in setting the completion date three months
away

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#91:1:A>
The two months completion date would make sense if D two  ' s
intention was to sell the Happy Valley flat in order to buy another flat so
that it would have sufficient time to arrange for more

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#92:1:A>
My Lord uh in any event My Lord uh quite rightly observe that there
there  ' s no reason why there  ' s there was a a concoction on the D three uh
part uh to invent the the the two months uh two months completion time

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#93:1:A>
My Lord uhm <,,> uh in respect of the uh issue on there being there  ' re
there  ' re a <.> re </.> return of the deposit it is the D one and D two  ' s
contention there are fifteenth of uh September meeting the plaintiff accepted
the return of his property of forty thousand dollars

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#94:1:A>
She has at that time purchased a flat in Discovery bay

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#95:1:A>
The Plaintiff states uh the only reason she mentioned Discovery Bay
was when she left the meeting

<ICE-HK:S2A-069#96:1:A>
She refused to take blank cheque </I>
