Dear Mr. Allen ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-016#309:13>
It  ' s delighted to hear from you again ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-016#310:13>
Here are the advertising rates of all the editions carried by
the Review and under separate cover I  ' ve put in the mail some rate cards ,
circulation details and readership profile for your persual . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-016#311:13>
Re property ads -

<ICE-HK:W1B-016#312:13>
we do not have a particular page focusing on this topic .

<ICE-HK:W1B-016#313:13>
However , if your real estate advertisement would take up a full
page , I suggest that you consider our regular news pages

<ICE-HK:W1B-016#314:13>
&obrack; Rates can be round in all editions as attached &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-016#315:13>
But if it is a smaller size ad , other than the sizes available in
the global edition , the International Classified Section is certainly the
best venue . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-016#316:13>
Re booking and material deadlines -

<ICE-HK:W1B-016#317:13>
we have different dates set for the regular news pages and
International Classified Section .

<ICE-HK:W1B-016#318:13>
Please see the <-> attachement </-> <+> attachment </+> for details .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-016#319:13>
Thank you for supporting the Review .

<ICE-HK:W1B-016#320:13>
I look forward to hearing back from you . </p>
