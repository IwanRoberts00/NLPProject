<bold> The prospect of mediation in resolving construction disputes
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#2:1>
Mediation , which is considered to be one of the most effective
means of resolving disputes , is now being used to a large extent around the
world .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#3:1>
It is found to function perfectly well for many types of disputes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#4:1>
Specific success has been recorded in such areas of disputes as trade
, construction , purchasing and supply , banking , insurance , personal
injury, partnership , consumer , maritime , divorce and family matters . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#5:1>
Parties from the Far East , in virtue of their customs and
traditions , are much in favour of and advocate the two-tier system of
mediation and , should it not succeed, arbitration .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#6:1>
In other countries as well , such as South Africa , New Zealand ,
Germany and the United States, to name a few , mediation is nowadays
attempted as an alternative way of dispute resolution .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#7:1>
Additionally , it is generating considerable interest in the United
Kingdom as revealed by the recent discussions on this hot issue in the
leading arbitration journals . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#8:1>
On the whole , the parties having employed this mode of dispute
resolution responded favorably in their attendant evaluations , specifically
about its fairness and capability to effect an expeditious accommodation at
low cost .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#9:1>
Reported success rates in mediation have been claimed to be over
80&percent; . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#10:1>
The demand for change in Hong Kong </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#11:1>
The usual procedure for resolving disputes in the construction
industry of Hong Kong has been the incorporation of an arbitration clause in
the conditions of contract rather than referring to litigation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#12:1>
This approach has the advantage that the appointment of the
arbitrator as well as the conduct of the arbitration are under the auspices
of the parties . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#13:1>
Unfortunately , in these two decades , the arbitration process
has become increasingly complex coupled with protracted duration and
spiralling costs , prompting moves towards the exploration of an alternative
mode of disputes resolution which should be both inexpensive , expeditious
and efficacious .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#14:1>
Indeed , arbitration , by its very nature , is inherent with the
adversarial approach to resolution of disagreements and it is this respect
which generally mirrors litigation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#15:1>
The confrontation involved , with little possibility of communication
and cooperation , is not unfrequently at the expense of goodwill between the
parties and the on-going harmonious business relationship .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#16:1>
As such , arbitration is very often considered as dragging the
parties into battle which contributes nothing for continuing commercial
relationships . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#17:1>
Moreover , the usual conditions of contract , whether in the
government forms or those for the private sector , preclude reference to
arbitration prior to the completion of the construction work .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#18:1>
Hence , even disputes of a very minor nature incurring early in a
contract can cause tension or even damage to the relationship between
contractor and employer and , in turn , evoke further disputes and contract
delays .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#19:1>
In this respect , the employment of a truly independent mediator , as
opposed to the &ldquo; Engineer &rdquo; or the &ldquo; Architect &rdquo; in
the contract whose status was claimed to have been increasingly eroded
recently , would give an immediate and quick decision or judgment on any
disputes that arise, which if either party disagreed , could later be
challenged through arbitration . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#20:1>
Besides , litigators , often appointed as arbitrators , are
trained up and are used to adversarial proceedings where they are able to
exercise their wit or gamesmanship by reference to the legal rules .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#21:1>
However , laymen in the construction field do not perceive any
advantages to employ this mode of disagreement settlement in their cases and
the prevailing tendency is against acute adversarial ways of resolving
disputes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#22:1>
In response to dissatisfaction from the involved parties ,
traditional approaches to the conduct of arbitration , which in general
follows the court procedure , are being modified.

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#23:1>
Hence the recent proneness in the development of the dispute
resolution alternatives can be considered as one form of evolution of modern
commercial arbitration . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#24:1>
It is well recognized that in the construction industry the
success of a project originates from cooperation and not confrontation
between the promoter and the contractor .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#25:1>
It is believed that the internal cohesion within the relatively
self-contained or isolated construction activities will be impaired if
adversarial proceedings are employed to settle disputes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#26:1>
Thus the overwhelming lay disenchantment with the adversarial system
of justice cannot be over-emphasized .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#27:1>
A firm credence is held that discords ought to be settled within the
industry itself by processes of dialogues and , as a matter of course , not
by any confrontational means .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#28:1>
As such, mediation as a means of resolving disagreements is
intuitively preferred .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#29:1>
Over and above , it can be considered as a response to the discerned
insufficiencies of commercial arbitration as a dispute settlement process .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#30:1>
Based on the above premises , the Hong Kong Construction
Association and the Association of Consulting Engineers have imparted strong
backing to the mediation notion and advocated it to the Hong Kong Government
which is found to be highly receptive .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#31:1>
Both the consultants and the contractors in the construction field
were proved to welcome the concept whole-heartedly , other references . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#32:1>
The importance of the suitability of the mediator candidature who
should be free from any possible conflict of interest and should possess the
technical expertise to the subject matters cannot be overemphasized .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#33:1>
Evidently , the more eminent the mediator , and the better reasoned
his opinion , the higher the possibility of it being accepted by both parties .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#34:1>
Throughout the mediation it is imperative that the mediator must be
conceived to be neutral , which maintains the confidence of both parties .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#35:1>
In addition , mediators , whose tasks comprise shuttle diplomacy ,
should possess personal and social tacts specially identified with mediation
as a non-adversarial method of settling disagreements . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#36:1>
Pros and cons of mediation </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#37:1>
Whilst mediation is usually relatively expeditious and
inexpensive in costs , arbitration can be lengthy, time-consuming and
expensive and hence mediation normally costs a fraction of arbitration .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#38:1>
It stems primarily from the usual exclusion of the access to legal
representation of the parties in mediation , although they are not precluded
from procuring legal advice .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#39:1>
In arbitration, the parties are often represented by lawyers , being
claimed to effect the bulk of procrastination and additional expenditure .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#40:1>
The employment of competent lay advocates in mediation should achieve
substantial savings since , being technical , they are better able to adjudge
and do away with irrelevant matters and associated paperwork .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#41:1>
Hence , rather than millions of dollars , the mediation process ,
even for complex situations , should only run to hundreds of thousands of
dollars . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#42:1>
The resolution of a dispute with the aid of a mediator clearly
holds greater chance for an on-going business relationship between the
parties and the likelihood of mutual satisfaction with the outcome is
enhanced .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#43:1>
This is in contrast to the case for arbitration or litigation where
the award may leave one , or both , of the parties feeling aggrieved with
little prospect of the business relationship continuing .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#44:1>
Mediation conduces to alleviate hostilities by fostering cooperation
through a structured way .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#45:1>
On the contrary, arbitration is apt to highlight alienation and
aggravates the resentment of the parties .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#46:1>
The sense of competence attained in the mediation process is an
essential by-product that aids in furnishing self-direction and in mitigating
the propensity for the parties to carry on the battle . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#47:1>
One of the greatest disadvantages to mediation is probably the
lack of finality in its enforcement .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#48:1>
The mediator  ' s opinion is only persuasive and either party may elect
not to follow it and may proceed to arbitration under the provision of the
construction contract .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#49:1>
However , since mediation is purely voluntary and everyone who
undertakes oneself may of course also be expected to honour the ensuing
agreement .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#50:1>
Besides , as an expert on the subject matter in dispute , the
mediator  ' s opinion will , of course , deserve respect and be difficult to be
disregarded .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#51:1>
In fact , it is the mediator  ' s responsibility to ensure that his
opinion must be sufficiently convincing and logically sound .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#52:1>
It is hoped that the parties , having had an independent assessment ,
would take the view that , were they proceed to arbitration , a similar
decision would most likely come up and hence there is no benefit in
challenging it .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#53:1>
Although the opinion is not binding , at least the parties are placed
in a better position to consider whether or not to proceed to arbitration .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#54:1>
Even if the mediator is unable to persuade the parties to reach a
consensual accommodation and the dispute proceeds to arbitration , the
mitigation of hostility , by advocating direct dialogues between the parties
through this process , paves the way for the permanence of an accommodation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#55:1>
It naturally keeps down the possibility that a controversial
proceeding will persist beyond itself.

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#56:1>
The costs involved in the preparation would not be entirely lost as
the information gleaned together could be used in the subsequent arbitration .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#57:1>
As such , mediation normally narrows the issues in dispute and so
shortens the time and cost of any subsequent arbitration . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#58:1>
One advantage of mediation is that flexibility exists to withdraw
from it should one party be dissatisfied with the attitudes adopted by or the
style of the mediator .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#59:1>
In such circumstances , the recommendations of the mediator can be
disregarded .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#60:1>
From this point of view, lack of finality can be considered as an
attraction of mediation since it allows the parties objectively to value the
personal qualities of the mediator and the weight to attach to his
recommendations , in determining whether or not to observe his opinion or
proceed to arbitration.

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#61:1>
Besides , in an arbitration , a party may be reluctant to elucidate
and depict some related background information fully .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#62:1>
It is certainly not as open and unreserved as he might be willing to
accomplish in mediation proceedings by virtue of its distinct characteristics
of confidentiality . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#63:1>
Both the premises for mediation as an alternative way to the
confrontation process and the effect of mediated agreement render it a
promising process against the adversarial methods .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#64:1>
Mediation can enlighten the parties about the other  ' s demands and
furnish a peculiar model for resolving any prospective disagreements .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#65:1>
It can thus assist them to recognize working collaboratively ,
isolate the subject matters and appreciate the significance of cooperation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#66:1>
Mediation offers this advantage due to the fact that it is not
strictly bound by the rules of procedure and substantive law which dominate
the adversary methods .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#67:1>
The mediator is not which was claimed to be all in all a progressing
development in the industry . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#68:1>
Implementation in public construction sector </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#69:1>
The Hong Kong Government , having recognized that arbitration can
frequently be very expensive and time-consuming , has implemented mediation
on a trial and selected basis since 1984 , adopting a mediation procedure
formulated in consultation with the construction industry and the associated
professions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#70:1>
Owing to the marked successfulness of the trial scheme , in 1989 the
government determined to incorporate a clause to formalize mediation , which
is effected by the promulgation of Lands and Works Branch Technical Circular
No. 8/89 on administration guidelines for mediation in construction disputes
, in all Group B building and civil engineering contracts and above &obrack;
i.e. all larger contracts &cbrack; , and all electrical , mechanical and
building services contracts of equivalent value , as an alternative means of
resolving construction disputes to arbitration. The Hong Kong Government Hong
Kong Institution of Engineers Mediation Service Rules , as it is currently in
force , has also been evolved in the light of experience . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#71:1>
Under the captioned Mediation Service Rules , the Hong Kong
Institution of Engineers &obrack; HKIE &cbrack; , as an appropriate and
impartial third party , will undertake the administration of the mediation
procedure .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#72:1>
Mediation can be requested by either party at any time during the
construction process .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#73:1>
Parties to a disagreement will direct their requests for mediation
through the HKIE .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#74:1>
If the parties themselves are not able to agree on the same mediator
, the HKIE will appoint an appropriate person after having consultation with
other professional bodies involved in the construction industry . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#75:1>
The right of the parties to litigation or arbitration will not be
affected by the reference to mediation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#76:1>
In spite of the introduction of mediation into the standard forms of
contracts , both parties are not compelled to follow the course and are
allowed to have recourse directly to arbitration .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#77:1>
Unless all parties concerned have indicated willingness to
participate , mediation will not be initiated . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#78:1>
The mediation process </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#79:1>
Mediation is not a legal procedure but is a process within an
informal yet structured framework , whereby a dispute is referred to a third
person , who hears and analyses the facts and arguments , formulates his
opinion on the respective merits , and endeavours to arrive at a compromising
and mutually acceptable accommodation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#80:1>
It , being a non-adversarial alternative method of dispute resolution
, seeks to encourage the parties to communicate , appreciate and evaluate
each other  ' s viewpoints and come up with a settlement with one accord .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#81:1>
In this regard , the mediator concentrates on the factual background
and attempts to create an atmosphere for the parties to resolve their
disagreement with the appropriate financial implications instead of ordering
an award or judgment unilaterally .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#82:1>
It must be stressed that the parties are not obliged to accept the
mediator  ' s opinion , which is not legally binding . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#83:1>
The most significant difference between mediation and arbitration
is in the approach adopted in the respective processes , namely ,
non-adversarial in mediation and adversarial in arbitration .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#84:1>
Mediation is also differentiated from conciliation by the more active
degree of involvement of the mediator than the respective conciliator.

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#85:1>
Thus mediation can be considered as half-way between conciliation and
arbitration . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#86:1>
The aim of mediation is to attain an expeditious solution to a
dispute at minimum cost .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#87:1>
Under the HKIE mediation system , the mediator is anticipated to
endeavour and conclude the whole process within 42 days and , for a complex
case , not more than three months unless agreed otherwise . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#88:1>
In conducting the proceedings , a mediator is allowed higher
flexibility than an arbitrator .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#89:1>
He may have preparatory discussions with one party only .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#90:1>
He is entitled to abstain from conveying some materials known from
one party to the other .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#91:1>
In arbitration , any communications between the arbitrator and one of
the parties in the absence of the other party would lead to misconduct and
could probably result in his award being set aside or even to his removal .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#92:1>
The costs are normally borne in equal share by the parties except
in special circumstances where full costs may be ordered against a party who
vexatiously initiated the dispute .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#93:1>
The procedures remain private and confidential and are not subject to
disclosure or being introduced as evidence in any subsequent proceedings
although mediation is not a formal legal procedure . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#94:1>
The conclusions will only be recorded in open correspondence by
the HKIE , if and only if the mediation is successful . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#95:1>
Pre-requisites for mediation </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-014#96:1>
For a disagreement to be settled by mediation , the possession of
single mind to cooperate on the part of each party is one of the most
significant pre-requisites.

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#97:1>
It is clearly essential that both parties are ready and willing to
discuss the matters in dispute .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#98:1>
They must be aware that every disagreement will be resolved
eventually and that settlement by agreement always costs less in both
monetary and time domains than settlement by bound by the terms of the
contract , giving flexibility to reach an agreeable solution .

<ICE-HK:W2A-014#99:1>
The final jurisdiction in mediation is incumbent upon the parties
themselves, and they may fashion-make a particular form of solution for
themselves under no influence of precedent cases in common law . </p> </I>
