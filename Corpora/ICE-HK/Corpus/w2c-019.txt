<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#3:1>
A Hong Kong political dissident , Lau San-ching , jailed for 10
years by Beijing , was yesterday barred from standing in the district board
elections , causing outrage among legislators . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#4:1>
Lau was imprisoned for &ldquo; counter-revolutionary activities
&rdquo; , not a crime in Hong Kong , but the Government said he was
disqualified because he did not meet residency requirements . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#5:1>
He will now take his case to the High Court for a ruling , but not
in time to be able to contest next month  ' s election &dash; the territory  ' s
first fully direct poll . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#6:1>
Lau said he would stage a hunger strike outside Government House
tomorrow to protest against the decision . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#7:1>
His disqualification prompted anger from lawmakers who called on
the Government to overhaul electoral provisions that the United Democrats
called &ldquo; nonsense &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#8:1>
The independent legislator Emily Lau said Lau  ' s disqualification
was a &ldquo; dress rehearsal &rdquo; to show Hong Kong people that those who
do not toe the political line would be barred from running for election in
the future . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#9:1>
The Government yesterday denied its decision was politically
motivated . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#10:1>
It said Lau failed to satisfy the condition of being &ldquo;
ordinarily resident &rdquo; in the territory for 10 years prior to the
election , referring to Lau  ' s imprisonment in China . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#11:1>
This is despite the fact that Lau  ' s wife , Christina Tang , was
allowed to stand in the district board elections in 1985 although she had
spent 12 years abroad . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#12:1>
In applying the residency rule , which had not been used to
disqualify any candidate in any previous elections , the Government also
disqualified a member of Meeting Point , Danny Chin . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#13:1>
Chin spent six years in the United States during the 10 years
before the election . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#14:1>
&ldquo; The Hong Kong government is betraying the democracy of
Hong Kong, &rdquo; Lau said .

<ICE-HK:W2C-019#15:1>
&ldquo; They are kowtowing to China by disallowing a prisoner of
conscience from running in the district board elections . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#16:1>
The acting governor , Anson Chan , said yesterday the decision
was final and the Government would not intervene in the returning officer  ' s
decision . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#17:1>
Apollonia Liu , the returning officer for Kwai Tsing district ,
where Lau registered as a candidate , said Lau  ' s conviction and jailing in
the mainland since 1982 was not a factor in her decision to disqualify him .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#18:1>
Liu denied she had been instructed by senior officials to
invalidate Lau  ' s nomination . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#19:1>
She said it was a &ldquo; purely legal decision &rdquo; based on
advice offered by the Legal Department . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#20:1>
&ldquo; Whether a person is ordinarily resident in a place is a
question of fact, &rdquo; she said .

<ICE-HK:W2C-019#21:1>
&ldquo; The state of mind and intention of the applicant has little
significance . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#22:1>
Liu said Lau  ' s seven-year absence during the 10-year qualifying
period overrode all other factors in assessing the validity of his nomination .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#23:1>
Lau had argued that he was absent from Hong Kong against his will
in serving the 10-year sentence in China . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#24:1>
The chief electoral officer , Carrie Willis , said there was
&ldquo; absolutely no political motivation in this case &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#25:1>
Regarding Tang  ' s eligibility to stand in the 1985 election
despite her 12-year absence from Hong Kong , Willis said : &ldquo; What
happened in the past is that that has not come to the knowledge of the
authority responsible &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#26:1>
She said there were still about 20 cases where returning officers
were seeking legal advice on the validity of nominations . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#27:1>
Lau and Chin are the only two among 395 nominations invalidated
by the Government so far . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#28:1>
Other candidates are still to be informed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#29:1>
Another dissident , Yiu Yung-chun , jailed on the mainland for
one year after the Tiananmen massacre , is set to be disqualified as the
electoral rule also states that those who have been jailed for more than
three months for a conviction in Hong Kong or abroad within the 10 years
prior to an election will not be eligible . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#30:1>
Willis said the relevant returning officer has not made a
decision on Yiu  ' s case . </p> </I>

<bold> Wing Kay Po details election mud-slinging </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#33:2>
Police are investigating allegations that two pro-democracy
parties misused district board funds . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#34:2>
The complaints were made against members of the Association for
Democracy and People  ' s Livelihood &obrack; ADPL &cbrack; and the United
Democrats sitting on Kwai Tsing District Board . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#35:2>
The parties are believed to have accused each other of wrongdoing .

<ICE-HK:W2C-019#36:2>
Political insiders described developments as mud-slinging in the
build-up to next month  ' s district board elections . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#37:2>
The Commercial Crime Bureau &obrack; CCB &cbrack; has taken over
the investigation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#38:2>
A spokeswoman for the Independent Commission Against Corruption
yesterday confirmed the case had been referred to it by the police . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#39:2>
She declined to confirm whether the ICAC was launching an
investigation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#40:2>
A source said the problems started in April when a group of
district board members from the Tsing Yi Action Group , were involved in
irregularities in application for and use of district board funds . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#41:2>
The complaints have been investigated by the serious crime wing
of the Kwai Tsing police . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#42:2>
The ADPL and Tsing Yi Concern Group members allegedly retaliated
last month by lodging similar complaints against the United Democrats and
Tsing Yi Action Group members on the board . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#43:2>
Last week the Kwai Tsing police referred the case to the CCB ,
which started a fresh investigation into the allegations . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#44:2>
A member of the Tsing Yi Concern Group , who wished to remain
anonymous , said the United Democrats wanted to &ldquo; make use of the
police to grab all the seats in the district board election &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#45:2>
Chiu Wah-sing , of the Tsing Yi Action Group , denied the
allegations . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#46:2>
He said he did not expect the police investigation to affect the
district board elections . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#47:2>
A member of the United Democrats described the accusations as
political mud-slinging . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#48:2>
&ldquo; It is extremely counter-productive, &rdquo; he said .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#49:2>
&ldquo; Nor is it doing any favours to the democratic front by
doing things like this . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#50:2>
&ldquo; It is not going to improve relations between the united
Democrats and the ADPL , which are already strained . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#51:2>
Kwai Tsing District Board contains almost equal numbers of ADPL
members and United Democrats . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#52:2>
The United Democrats and Meeting Point members will field 13
candidates in next month  ' s elections for the 26-member board while the ADPL
will field nine . </p> </I>

<bold> Lau , Wong to clash in Legco elections </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-019#54:3>
<bold> Wing Kay Po </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#55:3>
Two independent legislators , Emily Lau and Andrew Wong , are set
to clash in next year  ' s Legislative Council elections . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#56:3>
The question of full democracy for Hong Kong is likely to be
crucial to their campaigns . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#57:3>
The possible clash is because of a decision by the Boundary and
Elections Commissions to split the New Territories East constituency &dash;
from which both Lau and Wong were elected in the last direct elections in
1991 &dash; into the Sha Tin and Sai Kung constituencies . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#58:3>
Wong said yesterday he planned to stand in Sha Tin , where Lau
intends to run . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#59:3>
The Sha Tin constituency covers the Sha Tin town area , while the
Sai Kung constituency extends from Ma on Shan to Sai Kung and Tseung Kwan O .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#60:3>
Wong , a lecturer at the Chinese University , said he has lived
in Sha Tin constituency for more than 20 years .

<ICE-HK:W2C-019#61:3>
His ward office is situated at New Town Plaza in Sha Tin . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#62:3>
Lau &dash; who is the most popular legislator , according to
opinion polls &dash; lives in Castle Peak Road , near Tsuen Wan , but her
ward office is in Sha Tin .

<ICE-HK:W2C-019#63:3>
She was not available for comment yesterday but she has previously
said she believed she would with wherever she stands . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#64:3>
Lau and Wong beat five other candidates in the 1991 polls ,
including two United Democrats , Lau Kong-wah and Wong Hong-chung .

<ICE-HK:W2C-019#65:3>
Lau was the highest polling candidate . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#66:3>
Wong , who has served as a Sha Tin District Board member , was
first elected in 1985 to the Legislative Council through the electoral
college system . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#67:3>
If Lau and Wong clash , it could be one of the closest election
results in the territory . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#68:3>
But Wong said yesterday it was possible he or Lau might
eventually decide to &ldquo; back down &rdquo; and stand in the Sai Kung
constituency . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#69:3>
Wong came in for criticism yesterday for voting in June against
Lau  ' s private member  ' s bill to have all 60 seats in Legco directly elected .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#70:3>
The United Ants , an advocacy group for human rights and full
democracy went to Wong  ' s ward office to accuse him of killing Lau  ' s bill
which was defeated by one vote . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#71:3>
Wong said he voted against the bill , as there was little hope
China would amend electoral arrangements laid down in the Basic Law to
dovetail with the full democracy bill . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#72:3>
He said he rejected it because it would be seen by China as a
provocative move . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#73:3>
At a rowdy confrontation , the united Ants accused Wong of being
&ldquo; anti-democratic and anti-human rights &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#74:3>
They said he was going against the wishes of his constituents .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#75:3>
They lambasted him for opposing amendments to give New
Territories women equal inheritance rights , saying that showed his lack of
respect for human rights . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#76:3>
But Wong criticised the United Ants for &ldquo; playing games
&rdquo; with their campaign for full democracy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#77:3>
&ldquo; I follow my own judgment .

<ICE-HK:W2C-019#78:3>
I do what  ' s right for Hong Kong , &rdquo; Wong said . </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#81:4>
An independent legislator will take the unprecedented step of
preparing an alternative policy address to the one to be delivered by the
Governor , Chris Patten , in October . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#82:4>
Christine Loh said yesterday she hoped an &ldquo; alternative
vision &rdquo; of policy in various areas would widen public discussion on
how the community could move forward . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#83:4>
Covered in Loh  ' s document would be an alternative vision of
economic development in Hong Kong , a discussion on executive-led government
, and how open government could be developed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#84:4>
Other topics would be public health , transport and human rights
issues .

<ICE-HK:W2C-019#85:4>
Loh has not decided whether to include a section on constitutional
development and Sino-Hong Kong and Sino-British relations . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#86:4>
She would put forward her alternative policy vision before Patten  ' s
address to Legco on October 5 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#90:5>
Lau San-ching , the dissident jailed in China for 10 years for
&ldquo; counter-revolutionary activities &rdquo; will be told today if he is
eligible to contest Hong Kong  ' s district board elections in September . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#91:5>
Lau intends this morning to confront the Kwai Tsing returning
officer &dash; the official responsible for making the decision &dash; armed
with legal advice that he is eligible to stand as a candidate in the
elections . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#92:5>
He has vowed to sue the Government if it rejects his nomination
for candidacy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#93:5>
Other candidates will also be notified by their respective
district officers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#94:5>
Lau said his own barrister , who is preparing legal advice for
him , had told him he was eligible to stand despite his absence from Hong
Kong during his jail sentence on the mainland . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#95:5>
Legislation states that only those who are &ldquo; ordinarily
resident &rdquo; in the territory for the 10 years before an election are
eligible to stand in the election . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#96:5>
It also states that those who have a criminal conviction
resulting in a jail sentence of more than three months during the 10 years
leading up to the election will be disqualified . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#97:5>
Yesterday , the chief electoral officer , Carrie Willis , told
Lau and his supporters at an open meeting that restrictions relating to
criminal conviction were irrelevant in Lau  ' s case as he had been convicted
in 1981 , more than 10 years before this year  ' s election . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#98:5>
The only determining factor would be the residency requirement ,
she said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#99:5>
Willis said the returning officer in Kwai Tsing had made a
decision on Lau  ' s eligibility as a candidate after seeking legal advice on
his application . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#100:5>
The Government sought legal advice at the end of last year when
he first checked on his eligibility to stand for public office . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#101:5>
Lau argues he was &ldquo; ordinarily resident &rdquo; in Hong
Kong during his detention in China because he was detained against his will
and prevented form returning to the territory . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#102:5>
The Legal Department advised the Government that &ldquo; short
periods of absence from Hong Kong &rdquo; may not affect the residency
requirement &ldquo; depending on the circumstances &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#103:5>
The Registration and Electoral Office then informed Lau that
&ldquo; the period of your absence is of such length that it cannot be
bridged by this argument &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#104:5>
&ldquo; During your years of detention you were not resident in
Hong Kong, &rdquo; the office said .

<ICE-HK:W2C-019#105:5>
&ldquo; &obrack; The Office is &cbrack; advised a court would find
that you were not ordinarily resident in Hong Kong during that period.
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#106:5>
Willis would not say if further legal advice sought by the
district  ' s returning officer reached the same conclusion . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#107:5>
She said the returning officer was the only person who could
make the decision . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#108:5>
Lau said he would sue the Government for breaching the Bill of
Rights if his application was rejected .

<ICE-HK:W2C-019#109:5>
He said that the human rights ordinance stated that no one should be
deprived of their rights for political reasons and that he should not be
disqualified from candidacy because he was detained on political grounds in
China . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#110:5>
Under electoral legislation , Lau can appeal against the
returning officer  ' s decision in the High Court within two months of the
election . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-019#111:5>
If the High Court upholds the appeal , a by-election would be
held . </p> </I>
