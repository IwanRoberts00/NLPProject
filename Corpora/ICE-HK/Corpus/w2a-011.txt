HEDGING AGAINST A BELLICOSE CHAMBER </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#2:1>
The public will witness a new order in the Legislative Council
after September's elections .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#3:1>
The legacy of colonialism , which has enabled the administration to
exert unrestricted control over its legislative body , is becoming Hong
Kong's history . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#4:1>
The council will no longer be dominated by appointees , who have
been for years toeing official lines .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#5:1>
Instead , the forthcoming elections will simply create a large
majority of elected members in the Legco , To be returned in different
constituencies , the elected members will overwhelm their counterparts .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#6:1>
Underpinned by massive ballots , the directly elected members may
exploit their representativeness to the limit . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#7:1>
A demagogue-ridden chamber is emerging .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#8:1>
It is anticipated that the legislative councillors will be
uncompromising and deviating from government lines . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#9:1>
It is will known that bridging the gap between the administration
and the law-making body has been the job of unofficial members of the
Executive and Legislative Councils .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#10:1>
They are in turn supported by other appointed members in the Legco .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#11:1>
But the institution of a democratically constituted chamber , though
subject to qualification , ruins that practice . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#12:1>
In strictly legal sense , the Governor is empowered to dissolve
the chamber of blatantly veto bills already approved by it , if he finds the
situation beyond control .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#13:1>
This may perhaps help reassert government authority .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#14:1>
This measure may also compel members to take to compromises in order
to avoid another election .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#15:1>
Be that as it may , the question then lies in whether the
administration could survive the subsequent constitutional crisis . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#16:1>
Could the administration continue to gain enough support from
legislators to pass its bills ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#17:1>
The Government's idea of reviewing again rules governing the
proceeding of the Legislative Council , though having been keenly discussed
over the past couple of months , could not be seen as a measure to rule out
the possibility of a stalemate . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#18:1>
The choices at hand are limited , particularly when there will be
no structural reform in the political system in the years ahead .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#19:1>
A practical consideration is , therefore , to figure out the best
possible alternative under the existing arrangement . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#20:1>
The first alternative is to have the legislators in close contact
with the administration at an early stage of policy formulation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#21:1>
There is a need to establish a formal link between the advisory
committees , which are responsible for key policy issues , and the
Legislative Council and make the former directly accountable to the latter .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#22:1>
These committees , to be mainly composed of legislators and
highest-ranking officials , will be monitored by the Legislative Council .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#23:1>
Another alternative is that the administration appeals directly
to the public by making it possible for the community to exercise its
discretion on contentious matters .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#24:1>
When government bills are held back in the Legislative Council , the
administration may mobilise the support it needs from the public .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#25:1>
This may help it get over the hurdles posed by the elected members .

GO GREEN OR BE SORRY </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#27:2>
If Hong Kong does not keep pace with the green movement emerging
in industrialised nations , trade performance here could decline should
countries choose to use environmental issues to spark trade wars . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#28:2>
Industrialised countries are embarking upon their own legislative
initiatives to require manufacturing industries to take into account product
waste when they develop and introduce a product as a commercial item .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#29:2>
This is one of several actions symbolizing the control which
environmental concerns are having on trade agenda . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#30:2>
In 1989 Hong Kong was obliged to pass a law to ban the import and
manufacturing of chlorofluorocarbons , chemicals which deteriorate the ozone
layer , shortly after the Montreal Agreement signed by most OECD countries .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#31:2>
The Hong Kong Government's anti-pollution policy to date
stipulates a maximum level of pollutants .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#32:2>
This policy is underpinned by anti-air , water , noise and waste
pollution ordinances . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#33:2>
But compliance is costly .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#34:2>
The Government set out a plan , published in the 1989 White Paper
entitled &ldquo;Pollution in HongKong &dash; Time to Act &rsquo; , to build
treatment facilities and help enforce anti-pollution laws .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#35:2>
In this paper , the Government committed &dollar;20billion &obrack;
at 1988 prices &cbrack; to the cause .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#36:2>
Unfortunately , this White Paper was not preceded by a green paper ,
which usually includes consultation from the public . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#37:2>
With more regulatory measures underway to execute the four
anti-pollution ordinances , until the Government can illustrate that
anti-pollution policies to date are effective , it will be difficult to
muster the public and industrial support needed to enforce them . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#38:2>
The Government has not taken the lead to provide the information
and financial support needed for industries , in the immediate future , to
adopt a more environment-friendly way of doing business .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#39:2>
If this means that the private sector has to foot more bills , this
may not be well received because the Government has not yet made it clear
just what additional these costs will amount to .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#40:2>
And , furthermore , because of the declining productivity in the
manufacturing sector , companies may not be able to afford to do so . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#41:2>
Over 95&percent; of the local manufacturing companies are either
small or medium in size who encounter more difficulties in meeting the space
and cost requirements of environmental regulations than their counterparts in
other industrialized countries . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#42:2>
The Government's reluctance to address in a comprehensive manner
the private sector's role in upholding environmental standards is highlighted
by the fact that the Industry Department , not the Environmental Protection
Department which is responsible for environmental issues , is commissioning
the first major study to determine the impact of the Government's current
environmental policies on manufacturing industries . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#43:2>
Until the Hong Kong Government is able to integrate its
anti-pollution laws into a comprehensive policy which incorporates an
assessment of how complying with anti-pollution laws affects industries ,
Hong Kong's competitiveness could be in jeopardy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#44:2>
The Government will have to deviate from its present policy of
positive non-interventionism in order to address these environmental
concerns .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#45:2>
Such a change would be welcome because Hong Kong must be able to
respond to the environmental appeal of the international community without
losing its competitive edge . </p> </I>

Biotechnology : The Emerging Paradigm </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#47:3>
In order to improve Hong Kong's competitiveness , two questions
must be answered : first , should Hong Kong build up its own R &ampersand; D
capability in biotechnology; and second , if yes , should priority be given
to basic research or commercialisation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#48:3>
Biotechnology is commonly perceived to be the application of
scientific and engineering principles to the processing of materials by
biological agents to provide goods and services . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#49:3>
Its rapid growth in the last fifteen years or so , particularly
in the areas of genetic engineering , tissue culture , cell and enzyme
immobilisation , has brought about trade and employment opportunities .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#50:3>
The combined sales volumes of two products of bulk fermentation , for
instances , lysine and MSG &obrack; monosodium glutamate &cbrack; , now
amount to billions of US dollars annually . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#51:3>
Unlike the auto and aircraft industries , biotechnology will not
be offering more or less the same product categories in a low-growing market .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#52:3>
It serves , rather , to facilitate product development and
modification , reduce trade tension , and lower production cost through
process rationalisation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#53:3>
The OECD has predicted in a recent study that the contribution of
biotechnology to GDP will become significant twenty years from now . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#54:3>
With applications in the pharmaceutical industry , agriculture ,
food/feed processing , chemical and environmental industries , among others ,
biotechnology has been thought of as the next technological paradigm ,
subsequent to the computer-based paradigm .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#55:3>
That is , it will constitute a body of common-sense knowledge shared
by the next generation of engineers , managers , and consumers alike . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#56:3>
Threats , however , lie alongside opportunities .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#57:3>
The better the developed countries have equipped themselves with
advanced technologies , the smaller the portion of global trade the Less
Developed Countries and Newly Industrialising Economies will be able to
retain .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#58:3>
Also , the practice of purchasing technologies in the open market
rather than building up one's own R &ampersand; D capability will lead to a
structural dependency on technology-exporting countries . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#59:3>
Hong Kong is believed to be well poised to capitalise on this
upcoming technological revolution for the following reasons:

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#60:3>
&bullet; Hong Kong has a ready supply of brainpower required for
high-technology research;

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#61:3>
&bullet; the availability of technology-related information in Hong
Kong has provided a basis for Chinese and Hong Kong research units to pool
their manpower resources;

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#62:3>
&bullet; Hong Kong has developed the necessary management and
marketing skills for the launching of new products in the global market; and

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#63:3>
&bullet; the large number of entrepreneurial baby-boomers in Hong
Kong will be able to provide low and middle technological support to
high-technology endeavours . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#64:3>
In fact , biotechnology has been identified by the Technology
Road Maps , a group of Hong Kong top-ranking scientists and technologists ,
to be one of four industrial R &ampersand; D areas that should be given
priority . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#65:3>
Furthermore , it has been contended that firstly Hong Kong is
already lagging behind in the biotechnological race and secondly it would
take an exceedingly long period of time , up to twelve years in the case of a
generic drug prototype , just to complete the product development phase .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#66:3>
Hong Kong simply cannot afford to wait for serendipitous discoveries
to start the production process . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#67:3>
Research works geared to commercial purposes , on the other hand
, will generate badly needed capital to be ploughed back into both basic and
applied research projects .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#68:3>
This way , a critical mass can probably be reached within a shorter
period of time and without substantial government funding . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#69:3>
A case in point is the recently announced joint venture between
the Hong Kong Institute of Biotechnology and the American pharmaceutical
manufacturer Syntex .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#70:3>
The capital outlay amounts to millions of Hong Kong dollars but hard
cash comes mainly from the US side , whereas the Institute provides
managerial and sourcing services .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#71:3>
The probability of arriving at a lead compound is estimated to be
around .001 and the work load the joint venture is expected to carry would be
anywhere from four thousand to ten thousand samples a year .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#72:3>
From each lead compound , one or more drugs might be developed , each
could have a potential of sales on the average of US&dollar;200 million .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#73:3>
Chinese scientists in Beijing and Shanghai will be involved in this
research programme of the joint venture . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#74:3>
The term <mention> &lsquo; decentralised concentration &rsquo;
</mention> has been coined by the OECD , however , to describe a more likely
and feasible way of structuring the biotechnological industry .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#75:3>
Here , a small group of researchers would join a patent-holder in a
research institute or large-scale industrial establishment with a view to
developing commercial products . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#76:3>
As the launching phase draws near , the group will be ready to
spin off to form an independent business unit .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#77:3>
Subsequently , the structure of the industry will resemble a stellar
configuration with smaller business units attached to bigger corporations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#78:3>
The greater strategic flexibility when the business units continue to
demonstrate their innovativeness . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#79:3>
The key factors for success , at least at this stage , include :
&obrack; 1 &cbrack; adequate incentives from the government &obrack; which do
not yet exist &cbrack; ; &obrack; 2 &cbrack; cooperation with Chinese
scientists in R &ampersand; D; and &obrack; 3 &cbrack; a continuous dialogue
between researchers and industrialists . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#80:3>
The initiative taken by industries in R &ampersand; D activities
in the US has been attributed mainly to tax incentives granted by the US
government .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#81:3>
It is hoped that the same sort of environment can be created locally
to foster biotechnological R &ampersand; D .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#82:3>
It is also believed that industrial R &ampersand; D fares better if
the task of coordinating related activities is left to the private sector .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#83:3>
There is no denying , however , that the exchange of ideas ,
especially innovative ones , between local industrialists and scientists is
still restricted to formalities that preclude references to anything that
resembles business intelligence .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#84:3>
Also what should be ongoing communication between the two groups is
very often reduced to a one-shot deal and there is rarely a true meeting of
minds .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#85:3>
This is largely an issue of attitude .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#86:3>
Presumably there is ample room for Hong Kong industrialists to
improve communication with scientists . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#87:3>
Quite a few entrepreneurial researchers have already been lured
back to Hong Kong by setting up of bio-technological R &ampersand; D
facilities at the Hong Kong Institute of Biotechnology and the Hong Kong
University of Science and Technology .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#88:3>
Together with both local and Chinese scientists , they will no doubt
be able to find a place among the foremost biotechnological research teams .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#89:3>
It may be worth repeating here that the R &ampersand; D capability of
Chinese scientists in this area has been described to be nothing short of
outstanding . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#90:3>
It is almost certain that the world will benefit as much from
biotechnology as from the computer-based technology .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#91:3>
There will be rapidly expanding global market for biotechnological
products .

<ICE-HK:W2A-011#92:3>
To capitalise on this opportunity , Hong Kong should focus on a
market niche , exploit the learning curve , build up economies of scale and
preempt that niche . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-011#93:3>
That is , <-> afterall </-> <+> after all </+> , what staying
competitive is all about . </p> </I>
