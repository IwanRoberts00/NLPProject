Luck <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#2:1:A>
Risk

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#3:1:A>
This is risk <,> right

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#4:1:A>
Known or unknown

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#5:1:A>
Like uh <,> if <,> interest rate is going to go <,> down <,>  it affects your bank <,> account

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#7:1:A>
Interest rate is going to go up it affects your bank account <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#8:1:A>
Uhm <,> somebody in China say something <,> it affects the stock market <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#10:1:A>
It affect people  ' s pocket <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#11:1:A>
Uhm it also affects the uhm <,> people  ' s uhm <,> investment <,>  in
their flats

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#12:1:A>
Prices of flats goes up and down <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#13:1:A>
Risk <,,> uh <,> cannot be foreseen <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#14:1:A>
Some of them you can calculate it okay if I have this much customer
 based on past history <,> you can calculate your risk

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#17:1:A>
If I have <,> uhm <,> one thousand customer last year okay when I
make my plan this year if I put in this much of advertisement <,> I think I  ' ll
be able to have one thousand or more 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#18:1:A>
This <?> has been </?> calculated but whether it  ' s correct or not <?> look back with hindsight </?> 
you know

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#20:1:A>
But there are some thing we cannot calculate

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#21:1:A>
Somebody say something <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#22:1:A>
Or there is an uhm if one is building make uhm building a building

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#23:1:A>
I mean if a workman fell <,> fell and died probably it will affect the sale of that building

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#25:1:A>
These unforeseen <,> okay risk <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#26:1:A>
Having say all that <,> uhm <,> and now we can start talking about <,> Nuskin <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#28:1:A>
You remember all these

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#29:1:A>
Shall I rub it or keep it on the board

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#30:1:A>
I  ' ll keep it on the board

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#31:1:A>
I  ' ll try to make use of the rest alright <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#32:1:A>
So this rest of the time I  ' ll spend is exploring what is a Nuskin
business opportunity and is Nuskin business opportunity fit into <,> all this

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#33:1:A>
Right

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#34:1:A>
Let  ' s <,> when we look at a business in general terms <,> here <,> what are the what is the item <,> that bring in <,> revenue

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#36:1:A>
Cos the reason why we do business is what

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#37:1:A>
We do something we bring in some <,> revenue

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#38:1:A>
We are talking about accounting terms or bring in some money <,> right

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#40:1:A>
So among all the item here <,> 

<$Z>  <X> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#X41:1:Z>
The products </X> 

<$A>
<ICE-HK:S2A-058#42:1:A>
The products <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#43:1:A>
Do a lot of thing but eventually that  ' s the movement of product
that brings in revenue or bring in money

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#44:1:A>
So <,> I  ' ll spend some time uh talk about the Nuskin product <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#45:1:A>
Nuskin products as you see on uhm this table has some of it

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#46:1:A>
If you want to see the whole range like uh Kingsley  ' s chocolate
drink <,> it  ' s outside in in the uh in the <.> boar </.> in the <.> cup </.> 
in the cupboard

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#47:1:A>
Outside the cupboard one side is uhm IDN interior design
nutritionals and on the other side is personal care <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#48:1:A>
So Nuskin have <,> at the moment have two division personal care division and interior design nutritional <,> division

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#50:1:A>
That is the division at the <,> moment

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#51:1:A>
In Hong Kong we have uhm I would say about quite a high percentage
of the products that are available in the States maybe uhm say ninety-three
percent

<$Z>  <X> Almost <unc> SEVERAL WORDS </unc>  </X> 

<$A>
<ICE-HK:S2A-058#52:1:A>
almost uh uhm

<$Z>  <X> Eighty <unc> 1 WORD </unc>  </X> 

<$A>
<ICE-HK:S2A-058#53:1:A>
Eighty percent

<$Z>  <X> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#X54:1:Z>
Eighty to eighty-five </X> 

<$A>
<ICE-HK:S2A-058#55:1:A>
Eighty to eighty-five percent

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#56:1:A>
And there are some product that are uh waiting uhm <.> shi </.> 
shipment to come to Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#57:1:A>
Yeah you are correct

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#58:1:A>
There are something in Canada that we <unc> 2 WORDS </unc> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#59:1:A>
Alright

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#60:1:A>
Uhm next year say uhm in terms of product next year we are going to expand into new line

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#62:1:A>
We are going to have uhm colours for ladies lipstick eye shadow

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#63:1:A>
This I think that uhm I walk around <.> wit </.> uhm with the <.> 
prod </.> Lipsticks and not using I feel bad and I make noise

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#64:1:A>
So eventually they hear my voice

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#65:1:A>
And uhm we uhm as uhm our business expands <,> uhm Nuskin
distribution expands the company begin to think that we all need some tools
to help us

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#66:1:A>
So next year we  ' re going to have some friendly computers

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#67:1:A>
So that  ' s the plan for next year but this evening I  ' m going to
talk in general about personal care and IDN divison <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#68:1:A>
Whatever product Nuskin is <,> marketing okay there is one mortal guideline or principle behind it <X> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#X70:1:A>
and it is what is it Francis

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#X71:1:A>
All </X> 

<$Z>  <X> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#X72:1:Z>
All of the good none of the bad </X> 

<$A>
<ICE-HK:S2A-058#> All of the good <,> and none of the bad <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#73:1:A>
That means all the ingredient <.> it </.> they are used are good
for the body <,> cos it  ' s the product <,> enhancing our appearance and also
improving our health <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#74:1:A>
IDN Interior Design Nutritionals

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#75:1:A>
When people hear interior design some people think oh what  ' s it
got to do with furnitures <,> right

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#76:1:A>
But in fact when you come to think of it uh closely it  ' s redesigning the inside of our body <,> right

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#78:1:A>
Internally it redesigning

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#79:1:A>
So if we have good health <,,> it reflects on our physique and also
reflect on our face <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#80:1:A>
Plus if we have good personal care products from head from head to the toe cos I  ' m using all Nuskin products <,>  then we  ' ll have one complete person that is healthy <,> as well as
having good appearance

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#84:1:A>
Uhm I would say beauty but beauty is in the eye of the beholder <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#85:1:A>
When I look at the mirror every day I just find that the person in the mirror is changing every day <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#87:1:A>
You know what is it changing

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#88:1:A>
It  ' s getting younger and younger every day by look and is getting
wiser and wiser every day by experience

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#89:1:A>
But I  ' m not saying now that I  ' m getting older and older every day

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#90:1:A>
No <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#91:1:A>
So what is <unc> 2 WORDS </unc> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#92:1:A>
It  ' s because ingredients are all of the good none of the bad

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#93:1:A>
That is for the purpose it is uhm made

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#94:1:A>
But you say okay all of the good none of the bad <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#95:1:A>
Show me something

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#96:1:A>
So I uhm I  ' m going to do a a little uh some little test <,> just to uhm show uhm about <.> other </.> a little test on the personal care side

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#98:1:A>
'cos with the IDN product it  ' s kind of difficult to show that from
fat <&> shom - sound of magical effect </&> you become thin

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#99:1:A>
But if people that knew me before uh perhaps in their memory they may remember that I was much plumper and now I  ' ve slimmed
down <,> right

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#102:1:A>
But I <?> test </?> we concentrate on personal care <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#103:1:A>
First the first test I want to uh use is

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#104:1:A>
sometimes do you feel <,> do you notice that your face would be
dry when you are on an airplane or in the summer or in an office the air-con
make your face dry <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#105:1:A>
Right

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#106:1:A>
So <,> what do you do when your face is dry

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#107:1:A>
You go and have a wash <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#108:1:A>
Right

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#109:1:A>
Or when you feel sleepy what do you do <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#110:1:A>
Go and wash your face <,> so that you wake up

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#111:1:A>
So I have a mirror here <,,> a mirror here <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#112:1:A>
I also have a bit of water here <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#113:1:A>
Two side of a mirror one with uhm <,> pattern one without

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#115:1:A>
So choose one side <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#116:1:A>
Black side <,>  okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#117:1:A>
That I  ' m going to sprinkle some water onto it <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#118:1:A>
Okay sprinkle some water

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#119:1:A>
With the other side the one with a pattern <,,> I  ' m going to spray some NAPCN moisture mist

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#122:1:A>
We  ' ll see what happen <,,> okay <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#123:1:A>
So I shall put it over to here <,,> and let  ' s examine it later <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#124:1:A>
Next test I  ' m going to do is <,,> when we later go home <,> arrive home if you  ' re tired before we jump into bed <,> I usually I don't know about all of you I usually would have a shower

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#129:1:A>
Say supposing you do the same you have a shower maybe in the morning or in the evening whatever time it is what would you use <,,> to <,> cleanse yourself 

<$Z>  <X> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#X132:1:Z>
soap </X> 

<$A>  <X> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#X133:1:A>
A soap <,> okay </X> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#134:1:A>
Nuskin also have products that we use to wash <,> ourselves <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#135:1:A>
But our products are make <,> very near <,> to the texture all the
skin can accept

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#136:1:A>
So I have to do a bit of a theory here

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#137:1:A>
Ph value <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#138:1:A>
Zero seven <unc> SEVERAL WORDS </unc> look like a ruler

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#139:1:A>
It is called a Ph scale <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#140:1:A>
This is acidic <,,> this is alkaline

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#141:1:A>
Alka <,> line

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#142:1:A>
Correct spelling

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#143:1:A>
and this is <,> neutral <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#144:1:A>
What does that mean <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#145:1:A>
Supposing I say water is neutral

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#146:1:A>
I guess it begin to make some sense <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#147:1:A>
What did I say just now when we go home we shower

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#149:1:A>
So we shower we have our <unc> 1 WORD </unc> we have a
shower <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#150:1:A>
And then the shower <,> go on to what

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#151:1:A>
Our skin <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#152:1:A>
So what is the Ph value of our skin <X> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#X153:1:A>
Rhonda you know

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#X154:1:A>
No

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#X155:1:A>
Serena <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#X156:1:A>
Is our skin alkaline or <.> s </.>  <,> acidic </X> 

<$Z>  <X> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#X157:1:Z>
Acidic </X> 

<$A> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#158:1:A>
Acidic alright

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#159:1:A>
Because our our sweat taste a bit <,> salty <,> alright

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#160:1:A>
But yes you are quite right 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#161:1:A>
Our skin is <,> slightly acidic <,> and the Ph value is four point
five to six <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#162:1:A>
So that  ' s <,> prove that <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#163:1:A>
I have here some <,> test paper <,> some litmus paper

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#164:1:A>
It shows here <,> five point five <,> six seven <,> eight and nine

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#165:1:A>
Okay so it  ' s <,> within this range <,> okay <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#166:1:A>
I have here <,> some products and other company  ' s products as <,> 
well <,> as is uhm <,> our testing but uh this we just doing a comparison

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#168:1:A>
There  ' s no uh we  ' re not intending to tell <,> to say that they
are not good

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#169:1:A>
 <unc> 2 WORDS </unc> all by people  ' s choice <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#170:1:A>
People are free to make their own choice <,,>  <X> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#X171:1:A>
Let me have a <,> borrow a hand <,> please

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#X172:1:A>
Right <,> I dip this paper into the water <,> and <,>  <unc> 2
WORDS </unc> water <unc> 1 WORD </unc> colour and I put it on
your hand <,> okay <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#X173:1:A>
Another hand from a man

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#X174:1:A>
Thank you Kingsley <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#X175:1:A>
You  ' ll still have your hand uh tonight
<ICE-HK:S2A-058#> Don't worry </X> 

<$Z>  <X> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#X176:1:Z>
It won't disappear </X> 

<$A>  <X> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#X177:1:A>
No no no no no you can have my word <,> okay </X> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#178:1:A>
Then I dip this into the water and I put it on the Nuskin body bar

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#179:1:A>
 <?> Same thing </?> I do <,> dip into the water and I put into this
 <,> pink soup okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#180:1:A>
Pink soap

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#181:1:A>
Soap not soup

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#182:1:A>
I have problem of pronunciation <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#183:1:A>
I have a story about soup and soap

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#184:1:A>
When we have time I tell you about it <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#185:1:A>
And I dip some water <,> and put this into this uhm <,> nice
looking <,> expensive <,> soap <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#186:1:A>
So I need <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#187:1:A>
Uh Serena can you help me <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#188:1:A>
Stand <,> and hold this in your hand right <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#189:1:A>
And hold this in your other hand <,,> alright 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#190:1:A>
Okay so now <,> let  ' s look at the result <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#191:1:A>
This is five point five <,> this is very near <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#192:1:A>
This is very near but it  ' s too <unc> 1 WORD </unc>  <,,> 
very alkaline

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#193:1:A>
This is also very alkaline <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#194:1:A>
Let  ' s look at the scale 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#195:1:A>
You are about six <,> and you are about five point five 

<$Z>  <X> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#X196:1:Z>
Is that good </X> 

<$A> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#197:1:A>
Both of you are very normal <,> uh cos it  ' s four point five to
six 

<$Z>  <X> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#X198:1:Z>
Normal </X> 

<$A> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#199:1:A>
Normal normal

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#200:1:A>
The test is you  ' re normal and you can keep your hand isn't that
nice <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#201:1:A>
Right so <,> if you were to choose something to wash yourself with
 <,> would you choose something that is near <,> to your own body  ' s Ph value
 <,> or would you choose something that is <,> way way different <,> 
 <unc> SEVERAL WORDS </unc> 

<$Z>  <X> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#X203:1:Z>
What  ' s

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#X204:1:Z>
May I ask a question why would it be important </X> 

<$A> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#205:1:A>
Well <,,> that is a very good question 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#206:1:A>
Why would it be important

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#207:1:A>
Because if you choose something that will be near to your skin  ' s
Ph value <,> then your skin will have maintained its own natural protection
film

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#208:1:A>
If you choose something that is very very alkaline <,> what happen
is it will wash away the skin  ' s natural protection film <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#209:1:A>
Try to <,> now winter is coming <,> try to recall in the past
winter <,> when you wash yourself with soap <,> very soon after you cleanse
yourself what happen

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#210:1:A>
Your skin get dry <,> right <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#211:1:A>
And then what do you do

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#212:1:A>
Begin to scratch <,> right

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#213:1:A>
For me I have to put on a lot of cream <,> right

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#214:1:A>
A lot of cream to stop what

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#215:1:A>
To stop it from drying

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#216:1:A>
And I thought well I didn't use to know why

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#217:1:A>
And I change various soap <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#218:1:A>
When we use water to wash ourselves <,> would it automatically
change <,> to its <,> skin  ' s natural uh protection <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#219:1:A>
The answer is <,> yes <unc> SEVERAL WORDS </unc> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#220:1:A>
The answer is yes <,> but how long <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#221:1:A>
According to my information it will change back automatically but
it take ten to twelve hours <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#222:1:A>
How many times you wash your face a day

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#223:1:A>
I guess will be at least two <,> right

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#224:1:A>
So at least two is supposing you wash <,> seven in the morning <,> 
eleven at night or ten at night

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#225:1:A>
So this is <?> more than </?> twelve hours

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#226:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#227:1:A>
You will get back <,> originally

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#228:1:A>
But you  ' re on the street <,> it  ' s dirty <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#229:1:A>
But in at night after you wash it it  ' s clean your home supposed
to be <,> much cleaner <,> but that is less than twelve hours <,> right

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#230:1:A>
If this area <unc> 2 WORDS </unc> on twelve hours what if
you use product that are in this area <,> like this product

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#231:1:A>
That would take even longer <,> so your skin will get drier <,> 
right

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#232:1:A>
And when you have dry skin you <.> sca </.> scratch <,> right

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#233:1:A>
And you when you put on products that are not <,> good <,> that
are not ideal for moisturising <,> it will make <,> it will open your pores
it will make your skin even drier <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#234:1:A>
Uhm <,> if you have any further question regarding that we can
answer that later but I want to show <,> people that the <,> the Rhonda  ' s
hand just now it was about <,> six it was about six

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#235:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#236:1:A>
So that means your skin <,> after putting this on <,> the colour
will slightly change <,> as well <,> cos after we put this on what do we do <?> we spray </?> and then
we <.> tow </.>  <,> towel ourselves dry <unc> SEVERAL WORDS </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#244:1:A>
Okay so so you  ' ll help me rub her hand <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#245:1:A>
In Japan <,,> uhm there  ' s a story I hear I hear I I heard about
 <,> uhm <,> body bath

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#246:1:A>
Yes our product body bath

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#247:1:A>
In Japan we have a real life story

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#248:1:A>
There is this uhm gentleman or <,> uhm <,> sounds very English but
this gentleman or this is Chinese man <,> who live in Japan for many years

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#249:1:A>
So after he saw this uhm product demonstration he <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#250:1:A>
Let me just try one more time using <,> this <,> he called soap to
wash myself

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#251:1:A>
So he bought one piece that evening after the <,> uhm seminar he
went home <,> wash <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#252:1:A>
Why is it <,> let me just try one more time because for six years
 <,> he didn't wash himself <,> with soap <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#253:1:A>
He washed himself only with water because <,> as soon as he put
soap onto himself <,> he <.> s </.> scratch <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#254:1:A>
He scratch because it start so itchy

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#255:1:A>
He scratch until blood all come out <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#256:1:A>
So that evening he went back <,> he washed himself with this

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#257:1:A>
He said that let me just try one more time <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#258:1:A>
After that he sit down and wait <,> half an hour <,> you know what
happen

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#259:1:A>
Nothing happen <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#260:1:A>
Two hours later <,> you know what happen

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#261:1:A>
Nothing happen <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#262:1:A>
Then he went to bed <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#263:1:A>
The next morning <,> he wakes up <,> you know what happen <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#264:1:A>
Nothing happen <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#265:1:A>
He didn't scratch <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#266:1:A>
So you know what he did <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#267:1:A>
Hey <,> that  ' s the wife sleeping next to him <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#268:1:A>
I can wash myself from now on with this product

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#269:1:A>
I think this <,> uh even <,> if a small <,> piece of <,> soap or
 <,> we call it body bath is in this good quality <,> I think maybe we should
try the rest of the product

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#270:1:A>
So he brought
<ICE-HK:S2A-058#> His wife had been using Lancome <,> for a long time

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#271:1:A>
So they switch

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#272:1:A>
So they now become <,> uh an executive and they are very <,> 
diligent

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#273:1:A>
So I heard lately

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#274:1:A>
Okay <.> sh </.> and they are in the group of uhm <,> in a
friendly group in a of <unc> 2 WORDS </unc> in another friendly group

<ICE-HK:S2A-058#275:1:A>
So that  ' s the story of body bath and Ph value </I>
