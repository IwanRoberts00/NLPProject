GAMMA KNIFE RADIOSURGERY </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#2:1>
Plans for acquiring the gamma knife in Hong Kong date back to 1992 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#3:1>
After 3 years of intense negotiations , the Hospital Authority and a
private group at Canossa Hospital reached an unprecedented agreement: to run
the gamma knife program in a private hospital with private funds and manpower
, yet serving both public and private sectors .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#4:1>
In February 1995 , Hong Kong installed the fist gamma knife in the
region .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#5:1>
It marked the beginning of an era of image guided , minimally invasive
and multidisciplinary approach in neurosurgery . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#6:1>
TRAINING AND START-UP </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#7:1>
The start-up of radiosurgery service in Hong Kong is extremely
demanding .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#8:1>
Politics and financing aside , many logistic and practical questions
must first be addressed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#9:1>
The choice of magnetic resonance &obrack;  MR &cbrack; imaging , computed tomography
&obrack; CT &cbrack; and angiogram hardware is crucial .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#10:1>
For example , a distortion free MR imaging scanner is the top
priority .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#11:1>
Speed and resolution are crucial because targeting requires
submillimeter resolution of microanatomical details .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#12:1>
Lesser MR machines may take triple of time necessary for high
resolution sequences .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#13:1>
The compatibility of Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine &obrack; 
DICOM &cbrack; is almost indispensable .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#14:1>
It allows rapid transfer of an average of 160 images &obrack;  70 Megabytes
of digital data &cbrack; between workstations within minutes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#15:1>
Such a volume of imaging information is often necessary in today  ' s
state of the art dose planning . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#16:1>
For radiosurgery , the problem of the learning curve cannot be
overemphasized .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#17:1>
As in any open neurosurgical procedure , the same meticulous training
and supervision must be applied .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#18:1>
The practice of performing the occasional procedure by nondedicated
neurosurgeons may not yield the nest results .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#19:1>
The gamma knife team has received special training at Stockholm  ' s
Karolinska Institute of Neuroscience .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#20:1>
For the first 60 patients , each procedure was supervised by a senior
gamma knife surgeon from Sweden who possessed more than 20 years of
experience with the gamma knife .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#21:1>
Even after 600 consecutive cases , the team is still learning the art
and craft of gamma knife surgery .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#22:1>
Some centers , which initially employed an open system , are now
discarding the practice in favour of a dedicated team approach . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#23:1>
The Hong Kong Gamma Knife Centre &obrack;  HKGKC &cbrack; is run by a team of
three senior neurosurgeons &obrack;  one private and two from the Hospital Authority)
, one neurologist , one radiation oncologist , one neuroradiologist , one
medical physicist and two specialist nurses .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#24:1>
The neurosurgeon in charge takes the primary responsibility in all
stages of every gamma knife procedure .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#25:1>
All patient data are prospectively entered and sequential follow-up
protocol is planned in advance .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#26:1>
The centre now houses a vast computerized databases which is open to
referring physicians and patients .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#27:1>
Such open database policy ensures accountability and proper audit .
</p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#28:1>
STATISTICS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#29:1>
Within a period of 4 years , the HKGNC had performed 611
procedures on 568 patients , an average of 150 procedures annually .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#30:1>
The indications are detailed in table 8.1 and <O> A table </O> <O> A
figure </O> figure 8.1 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#31:1>
The statistics are similar to those of most major gamma knife centers
in USA , Europe and Japan .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#32:1>
More than 50&percent; of indications have prior neurosurgical
procedures or other forms of therapy .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#33:1>
In a separate analysis , only 15&percent; of the indications &obrack;  mostly
small acoustic neuromas  &cbrack; are up-front treatment which can be seen as
competitive to open microsurgical procedures .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#34:1>
Such competition sparked off a cascade of activities: special
training courses with live demonstrations by world class neurosurgeons ,
wide-spread use of neurophysiological monitoring and other techniques to
improve the out-come of microsurgery .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#35:1>
For the remaining 85&percent; of indications , gamma knife is used
either as an elective combined strategy , postoperative adjuvant therapy , or
as the only acceptable option when the risk of surgery is too high .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#36:1>
Thus , when a radiosurgery program is conducted by neurosurgeons with
equal expertise in microsurgery , they can ensure proper case selection ,
meticulous techniques , healthy competition among various treatment and
ultimately the best patient care . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#37:1>
ACADEMIC ACTIVITIES AND PUBLICATIONS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#38:1>
Realising that patient care is better when treatment is conducted
in the context of a prospective trial , the HKGFC has undertaken several
ongoing trials: combined microsurgery plus gamma knife for large acoustic
neuromas , craniopharyngiomas , and pituitary adenomas; same day stereotactic
biopsy plus gamma knife fro deep seated low grade astrocytomas , and the use
of stereotactic MR angiography for arteriovenous malformations &obrack;  AVMs &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#39:1>
Despite a relatively short follow-up time , the HKGKC has a
healthy academic output .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#40:1>
In addition to numerous invited presentations both locally and
overseas , the radiosurgery team has managed to submit nine papers of which
three have already been accepted for publication in peer reviewed
international journals .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#41:1>
In addition , the HKGKC also support a current PhD project on
radiation physics . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#42:1>
The Leksell Gamma Knife Society Meeting is an international
conference for academic exchange of research and clinical studies among 90
gamma knife sites worldwide .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#43:1>
In November 1998 , the Hong Kong Gamma Knife Team won the
chairmanship of the 9th Leksell Gamma Knife Meeting where more than 200
papers were presented by delegates from 30 countries .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#44:1>
Past chairmen included the giants of radiosurgery such as L . Steiner
, C . Lindquist , S . Forster and D . Lundsford . </p> <O> A table </O> <h>

LINAC-BASED RADIOSURGERY SYSTEMS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#46:1>
No description on radiosurgery is complete without mentioning
linac-based systems .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#47:1>
To date , at least five different systems are available in the market .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#48:1>
All of them employ different platforms of hardware and software ,
stereotactic frames and techniques in delivery of focused energy .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#49:1>
X-knife , Cyberknife , Linac Scalpel , etc are just a few familiar
names .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#50:1>
Hong Kong does not lag behind in the introduction of linac-based
radiosurgery .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#51:1>
The first linac-based radiosurgery was set up in Queen Mary Hospital
in November 1995 and within 4 years , there are totally seven linac-systems
( five in public and two in private hospitals &cbrack; in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#52:1>
Apart from more conventional arc-based systems , there are three that
utilize mini-multileaf collimator &obrack;  mMLC &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#53:1>
Particularly for nonspherical lesion , the latter is able to deliver
a lower dose of radiation to normal tissue and yet requires a much shorter
planning time .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#54:1>
Evolving from the same idea , there is now the concept of delivering
radiation via a motorized mulitleaf collimator &obrack;  MLC &cbrack; as it goes through an
arc .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#55:1>
A prototype of this conformal arc system is soon to be tested in Hong
Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#56:1>
Undoubtedly the technology of linac-based radiosurgery is still being
refined and we are expecting more innovation from this branch of therapy .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#57:1>
At this point in time , however , without prospective randomized
controlled trials , comparing gamma knife and linac-based systems is like
comparing apples and oranges .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#58:1>
Both systems have their own advantages and limitations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#59:1>
The gamma knife , being a dedicated instrument for neuroradiosurgery
, maintains the lead with its long track record , uniformly of methodology
and large series of published results in the literature .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#60:1>
The authors believe the peaceful coexistence of different
technologies is a healthy sign .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#61:1>
Clinical excellence comes form healthy competition , cross-speciality
learning , team work , concentrated experience , intellectual honesty and
vigilant audit . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#62:1>
COMPREHENSIVE RADIOSURGERY PROGRAMME </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#63:1>
A venue where the two system come together is found in Queen
Elizabeth Hospital .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#64:1>
Since 1996 , its radiosurgery programme has provided both linac-based
and gamma knife radiosurgery in collaboration with the HKGKC . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#65:1>
The selection of the modalities of treatment is based on clinical
grounds and decisions are made by a team of radio-oncologists ,
neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#66:1>
The general principles of case selection are based on: 1. The
proximity of the lesion to critical structures , 2. The treatment volume and
3. The requirement for target precision , eg functional disorders . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#67:1>
There is a general inclination to treat malignant cases with
linac-based radiosurgery and pituitary tumours with gamma knife . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#68:1>
Weekly combined radiosurgery clinics and monthly conferences
ensure exchanges of experience and problem cases .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#69:1>
A clinical radiosurgery database completed with image files
facilitates research and follow-up case studies . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#70:1>
To date over 100 linac-based and 300 gamma knife radiosurgeries
have been performed &obrack;  Table 8.2 &cbrack; . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#71:1>
SUMMARY </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#72:1>
The gamma knife is undergoing constant evolution and refinement .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#73:1>
Advanced training , upgrading of hardware and software and continuous
education are part of the regular agenda .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#74:1>
Be it an up-front or adjuvant procedure , its result on benign skill
base tumours and metastases and particularly impressive .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#75:1>
AVMs form a special category where a multidisciplinary approach is
the norm , although the problem of postradiosurgery latency period bleeding
has not been eliminated .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#76:1>
The gamma knife also opens up frontiers in functional indications
such as medically refractory trigeminal neuralgia , movement disorders ,
nonlesional temporal lobe epilepsy and compulsive obsessive neurosis .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#77:1>
Recently , patients with medically refractory malignant bone pain
have also responded dramatically to gamma pituitary ablation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#78:1>
We have shown that the gamma knife does not erode into the
practice of neurosurgeons .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#79:1>
It actually increases the surgical throughput of a neurosurgical
department and raises the competence of microsurgeons .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#80:1>
Today  ' s patients are extremely demanding .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#81:1>
They expect zero mortality , near zero morbidity , near 100&percent;
disease control and no disruption of life style .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#82:1>
They are very well informed and require a complete transparency of
data .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#83:1>
Health Management Organisations , lawyers , administrators and the
lay public are happy to target the medical profession .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#84:1>
All these put tremendous pressure on neurosurgeons .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#85:1>
Neurosurgeons must adapt to the new challenge .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#86:1>
They should give medical advice as if they are suffering from the
same ailment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#87:1>
Their own perspective on the doctor-patient relationship may have to
be revised . </p>

ABSTRACT </bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#92:2>
The designs of the variable frequency constant pressure water supply
for a single hydraulic pump and high power multiple hydraulic motor systems
are presented in this paper .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#93:2>
This system can save energy by controlling the speed of the pipe
motors which depend upon the number of consumers in use .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#94:2>
This system was also successfully implemented in most of the modern
buildings in Shanghai , China .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#95:2>
Finally , the choice criteria for variable frequency regulators for
water supply system will be discussed . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#96:2>
1 . INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#97:2>
It is inevitable to install high level water storage systems or
reservoirs for multiple story buildings or residential areas .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#98:2>
This kind of system results in increasing construction cost and
cleaning problems .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#99:2>
Nevertheless , hydraulic pumps are used to raise the energy level of
the water .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#100:2>
In fact , the conventional high level reservoir system is a pressure
regulatory system .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#101:2>
This pressure &obrack;  head &cbrack; is proportional to the height of the reservoir .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#102:2>
Resistance of pipes is varying from time to time , depending on the
demand and water flow rate .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#103:2>
When number of users increase , that means number of relief values
to be open is increased .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#104:2>
It in turn reduces the resistance of the pipes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#105:2>
In order to reduce the construction cost , eliminate the cleansing
problem of the high level reservoirs , and make the system simple , a
variable frequency constant pressure closed loop system is presented to
control the speeds of the hydraulic pumps .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#106:2>
In this paper , the designs of the variable frequency constant
pressure water supply for a single hydraulic pump and high power multiple
hydraulic motors system are presented .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#107:2>
From static characteristics of water flow system , the critical
point can be obtained to achieve the minimization of energy consumed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#108:2>
The implementation of this system is also discussed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#109:2>
The choice of variable frequency regulators for water supply system
is finally presented . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#110:2>
2 . ADVANTAGES OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#111:2>
In short , the advantages of this proposed variable frequency
constant pressure system for water supply are a &cbrack; In a 3 hydraulic motors
system , the capacity of the variable frequency regulator is just one-third
of the capacity of the overall system .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#112:2>
The cost is much reduced .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#113:2>
b &cbrack; Since the system consists of multiple pumping motors , they can
be controlled by PLC such that the system is more reliable .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#114:2>
c &cbrack; Energy saving can be achieved by controlling the speed of pump
motors , pressure can be kept constant no matter what water flow is &obrack;  from
zero to its maximum capacity &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#115:2>
d &cbrack; Each pumping motor can be started smoothly be using this variable
frequency regulator , it reduces pulse current .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#116:2>
This kind of water supply system could become a new trend in modern
multiple-story building design . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#117:2>
3 . PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#118:2>
The principle of operation was illustrated by a single pump
system .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#119:2>
Fig . 1 shows a block diagram of a variable frequency constant
pressure system which is suitable for single pump or small scale water flow
system .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#120:2>
The model type is JS5-P1 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#121:2>
The pressure sensor &obrack;  PS &cbrack; transduces the water pressure in pipes to
electrical signal .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#122:2>
This signal will go to pressure regulator &obrack;  PR &cbrack; through an amplifier
( A &cbrack; and a comparator compared with the set value of water pressure .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#123:2>
The difference will come to the PID control to regulator the output
frequency as well as the speeds of electric motors and hydraulic pumps .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#124:2>
The constant pressure can then be achieved . </p> <O> A table </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#125:2>
Fig . 2 shows static characteristics of this constant pressure
water supply system .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#126:2>
Curves 1 and 2 represent relationship between the pressure head &obrack;  H)
and flowrate &obrack;  Q &cbrack; for different speeds of the pump .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#127:2>
Curves 3 and 4 represent for different values of resistance pipe .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#128:2>
To simply the exposition , per unit values are adopted in the Fig .
2 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#129:2>
Hence H&star; &equals; H/H <sb> N </sb> and Q&star;&equals;Q/Q <sb> N </sb> where H <sb> N
</sb> and Q <sb> N </sb> are the set values of head and flowrate . </p> <O> A
figure </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#130:2>
In this system , both flowrate and the resistance of pipes are
varying because the flowrate is proportional to numbers of valves to be
opened .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#131:2>
Curve 3 represents the resistance of pipes when the flowrate reaches
the maximum point .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#132:2>
It intercepts with the H&star; - Q&star; at point a which is the set point for
operation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#133:2>
Curve 4 is for resistance of pipe when the flowrate is less and only
part of valves to be opened . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#134:2>
If there is no frequency regulator , it works at point b ' only .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#135:2>
At this moment , the head pressure exceeds the set value .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#136:2>
The flowrate Q is proportional to the speed of the pump , n .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#137:2>
Head pressure H is thus proportional to the square of the speed , n
<sp> 2 </sp> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#138:2>
The speed of the pump can be controlled by the frequency regulator .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#139:2>
It becomes the curve 2 , which intercepts curve 4 at point b , it is
a new set &obrack;  working &cbrack; point .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#140:2>
At this time , the set speed should be n&star;&equals;n/n <sb> N </sb>&equals;K &obrack;  K
<1 &cbrack; .  

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#141:2>
Obviously , the point b is lower than point b ' .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#142:2>
It in turn means that H at point b is less than that at point b'. H
<sb> b </sb> < H  <sb> b </sb> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#143:2>
It achieves the purpose of energy saving . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#144:2>
4 . FURTHER MODIFICATION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#145:2>
This JS5-P1 model was suitable for single pump water supply
system .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#146:2>
When the flowrate is little , the pressure can be much reduced . For
example , H <sb> p </sb> &star; varies from 1 to H <sb> p ' </sb> &star; which is less
than 1 &obrack;  H <sb> p ' </sb> &star; <1 &cbrack; .  

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#147:2>
It is able to save much energy .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#148:2>
From this working principle , it was modified to suit a large scale
multiple pumping water supply system .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#149:2>
A new model of JS5-P2 was then developed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#150:2>
Fig . 3 shows a block diagram of a variable frequency constant
pressure system consisting of 3 same capacity pumps .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#151:2>
It was modified from the JS5-P1 model .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#152:2>
It is designed for multi-pumps water supple system which
programmable logic control &obrack;  PLC &cbrack; is involved such that the number of
hydraulic motors in operation can be determined by the flowrate .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#153:2>
The rest of motors are in stand-by mode and the energy saving can be
realized . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#154:2>
From Fig . 3 , the system was composed of pressure sensor &obrack;  PS)
, pressure amplifier &obrack;  A &cbrack; , pressure regulator &obrack;  AP &cbrack; , signal identifier &obrack; 
AI &cbrack; , programmable logic control &obrack;  PLC &cbrack; , and frequency regulator .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#155:2>
The main feature of this system is that one set of variable
frequency regulator is in use to control one hydraulic motor .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#156:2>
The rest is idling at starting .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#157:2>
If the water flow is within the present range .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#158:2>
This motor is running according its characteristic curve .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#159:2>
When the flowrate is increased , the second motor will be smoothly
started .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#160:2>
The present value of pressure in pipes can be maintained .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#161:2>
There are three values for operating these motors , 0~33.3&percent;
, 33.3~66.6&percent; and 66.6&percent;~100&percent; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#162:2>
In brief , the first pump motor will work if the flowrate falls
within 33.3&percent; of operation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#163:2>
The operating region is within curves 1 and 4 in the Fig . 4 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#164:2>
When the flowrate increases beyond 33.3&percent; , frequency
regulator keeps the output frequency at 50Hz , PLC will control of on-off
state of the motors such that the first pump motor is supplied by the mains .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#165:2>
The speed of the first pump motor runs at rated speed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#166:2>
The region of the second motor is within curves 2 and 5 in the Fig .
4 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#167:2>
When the flowrate is continuously increased and beyond 66.6&percent;
, and the frequency regulator reaches its rated frequency 50Hz , PLC will
command the second motor to connect to the mains again and the third one at
stand-by mode .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#168:2>
The operating region of the third one falls within curves 3 and 6 in
the Fig . 4 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#169:2>
If the flowrate is reduced from 66.6&percent; to 33.3&percent; ,
PLC will command to one of the pump motors cut off from the mains .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#170:2>
When the flowrate further reduces , and less than 33.3&percent; ,
there will be only one motor connected to the mains .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#171:2>
From the working principle , the three motors are operated in turn
to meet the requirement of energy saving . </p> <h> <bold>

5 . CRITERIA FOR FREQUECNY REGULATOR </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-034#173:2>
For the load of the hydraulic pump , the torque t <sb> p </sb>
is proportional to the square of the motor speed , n <sp> 2 </sp> , it is
also proportional to the square of the supply frequency , f <sp> 2 </sp> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#174:2>
To a electric motor , the torque t <sb> m </sb> is equal to C <sb> m
</sb> ? <sb> m </sb> I <sb> 2 </sb> cosa , where C <sb> m </sb> is a constant
, ? <sb> m </sb> is the magnetic flux of rotating field , I <sb> 2 </sb> is
the rotor current , and cosa is the power factor of rotor circuit .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#175:2>
I <sb> 2 </sb> normally cannot exceed its rated value , so t <sb> m
</sb> ? <sb> m </sb> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#176:2>
If the voltage drop in the stator is negligible , ? <sb> m </sb>
will be proportional to supply voltage V.

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#177:2>
In order to maintain t <sb> p </sb>&equals;t <sb> m </sb> , the supply
voltage V should be required to be proportional to the square of the
frequency , f <sp> 2 </sp> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-034#178:2>
Therefore , the characteristic of V versus f should be set to be a
quadratic relationship . </p> 6 . CONCLUSION
