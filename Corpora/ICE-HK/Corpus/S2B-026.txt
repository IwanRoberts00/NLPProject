<ICE-HK:S2B-026#1:1:A>
Last Saturday I went to a wedding banquet of my cousin

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#2:1:A>
One of my distant relative Auntie Ming snatched me by my arm once when I arrive <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#3:1:A>
She was not in a particular good mood and she was complaining about Housing Authority  ' s new policies on property <.> in </.> ownership

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#4:1:A>
She <?> blamed </?> me for setting such a harsh rule to bring so much distress to her family

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#5:1:A>
Auntie Ming live in a public housing estate with her husband and twosons

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#6:1:A>
Auntie Ming is a housewife

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#7:1:A>
Her husband <,> Uncle Sum is a taxi driver

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#8:1:A>
He purchase a taxi some years ago by installment

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#9:1:A>
He has just paid off <.> hit </.> his mortgage recently

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#10:1:A>
Their two sons both <,> are in late twenties have been working for five to seven years since they graduate from tertiary education

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#11:1:A>
Their total household incomes per month just exceeds forty thousand dollars per month

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#12:1:A>
And the taxi is counted as a fixed asset of a value over one point five million dollars

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#13:1:A>
According to the new policy proposed on property ownership they are rich enough to pay full market rent

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#14:1:A>
It is estimated that the revised rental payment will be <?> around </?> ten thousand dollars per month

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#15:1:A>
The market rent will take up more than half of the Uncle Ming  ' s <.> inc </.> income

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#16:1:A>
My two cousins are nice young men who always manage their personal finance well

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#17:1:A>
They have to as they are saving up for their marriage in the near future

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#18:1:A>
Though each of them earn over ten thousand dollars per month we can imagine that they are not have too much money to spare <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#19:1:A>
Auntie Ming and Uncle Sum have been working hard and particularly <?> thrifty </?> of their life

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#20:1:A>
The <?> taxi </?> they own crystallizes all their <.> ss </.> <?> wealth </?> for the past forty years

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#21:1:A>
This property they invested in the means to earn a living and notfor our speculation <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#22:1:A>
I share Auntie Ming  ' s resentment for the punitive measure on them <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#23:1:A>
She was taught to believe that diligence and <?> thrift </?> should be ventured to be rewarded

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#24:1:A>
However she is disillusioned now as they are punished for not being lazy enough in order to live hand to mouth <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#25:1:A>
While Auntie Ming was ventilating her emotion the guest sitting next to me made a very sensible suggestion to her

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#26:1:A>
He said <,> you have to let at least one of your sons get married as soon as possible and so to move out of the unit

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#27:1:A>
Then you may transfer the ownership of the taxi to him <,> who is no longer on the tenancy

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#28:1:A>
And subsequently you have no asset in hand at all under your roof

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#29:1:A>
Even a casual onlooker can think of such a trick to elude the <unc> one-word </unc> of <.> porty </.> property ownership

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#30:1:A>
I am quite sure that the asset declaration is doomed to failure <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#31:1:A>
Auntie Ming  ' s neighbour Mrs Wong  ' s case even worse

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#32:1:A>
She ran a food stall and own a flat in Shum Shui Po twenty twenty years ago <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#33:1:A>
The area she live was affected by a Land <?> Resumption </?> exercise and the government <?> re-settle </?> her family in a public housing unit <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#34:1:A>
Her food stall  ' s business grew under the toil of all the family members

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#35:1:A>
At present it has been expanded into a decent restaurant <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#36:1:A>
They are obviously too rich to be subsidized by the tax payers  ' money <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#37:1:A>
We said her case is even worse because <?> our consciences </?> will not stir if this well-off restaurant boss has to pay market rent

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#38:1:A>
Unfortunately we have overlooked the fact that <,> the Wong  ' s family move in the public housing estate upon the government  ' s invitation without any <?> means test </?> in the first place <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#39:1:A>
They took it as a compensation for re-settlement without the slightest idea that fifteen years later they are labeled as being guilty of enjoying far too much welfare they do not deserve

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#40:1:A>
I can fully understand why they feel they are being cheated and <.> be </.> betrayed by the Housing Authority <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#41:1:A>
The Housing Authority has <?> some wishing </?> thinking that the introduction of new policies on property ownership will firstly to reduce the government  ' s unnecessary subsidy for the rich on the public housing

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#42:1:A>
And secondly such well off <?> tenants </?> have felt the pinch of paying market rent will be more motivated to vacate their unit for the more needy families

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#43:1:A>
And subsequently it will speed up the prolong waiting period of applicants <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#44:1:A>
I tend to look at the issue from three different perspectives

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#45:1:A>
First how rich is rich enough

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#46:1:A>
We have to explore for a yardstick that the general public will agree too

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#47:1:A>
Anything beyond that will be too rich to enjoy housing benefits

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#48:1:A>
If one is really rich enough according to such a standard he or she should move out instead of lingering on by paying market rent

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#49:1:A>
Second the new policy implies a retrospective <?> effect </?> as the contract they made with the government ten or more years ago did notinclude such a condition about property ownership

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#50:1:A>
We may be right to implement the new policy among new tenants by telling them well beforehand that they will be subject to <?> means </?> test ten years later to reconfirm the eligibility on public housing

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#51:1:A>
However <.> that he has </.> it is against the spirit of the Common Law to introduce the policies amongst <.> existent </.> <?> existing </?> tenants

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#52:1:A>
Third <,> even if there is no problem in the legal aspect we have to query about the practicability

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#53:1:A>
There are just too much loophole in asset declaration

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#54:1:A>
People will be quick to play tricks to elude their market rent punishment

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#55:1:A>
Eventually we can predict <?> that a spectacular </?> amount will have to be spent for the administration <?> for </?> the number of units orthe amount of subsidized <?> rent </?> recovered from the policies will be negligible

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#56:1:A>
Is it worth the trouble <,> or to encourage those rich tenants to buy a unit from the Home Ownership Scheme or to buy their own public rental unit be a better options </I>

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#57:2:A>
This week both former governor Lord Wilson and former British prime minister Lady Thatcher are visiting Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#58:2:A>
How very much things have changed since the days when they used to speak of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#59:2:A>
Have you noticed that we don't hear <mention> a high degree of autonomy </mention> from either Britain or China anymore

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#60:2:A>
I remember my last meeting with the then governor Sir David Wilson just before he returned to the UK in nineteen ninety two

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#61:2:A>
I appealed to him to do something to help the people here who had expressed their democratic aspirations so clearly in the nineteen ninety one elections <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#62:2:A>
He in turn appealed to me implying that I was wrong in holding out to the people of Hong Kong the hope for democracy in the future

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#63:2:A>
His view was that Hong Kong people would be better off if they do not aspire for more freedoms than China was willing to give

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#64:2:A>
I then told him a story

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#65:2:A>
I said <,> I have a very good watchdog that barks whenever stranger approaches my flat at night but I have to leave Hong Kong and I want somebody to take over the dog

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#66:2:A>
A friend said that he was happy to take the dog but he also said that he would not tolerate dogs that bark at night because he had to get up early in the morning

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#67:2:A>
So I began to beat my dog every time it barks at night all for the good of the dog of course because my friend would certainly hit it harder than I would and that is the most humane way to get him ready for the transfer of sovereignty <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#68:2:A>
Lady Thatcher  ' s visit here reminds me of her statement two days after she signed the Joint Declaration with then Chinese President Zhao <?> Zhi </?> Yang on the nineteenth of December nineteen eighty four

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#69:2:A>
She said proudly <,> <quote> the eyes of the world are upon us </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#70:2:A>
The eyes of the world are indeed on us but what do they see

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#71:2:A>
They see a recent survey which found that more than forty percent of Hong Kong  ' s young people want to emigrate before nineteen ninety-seven <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#72:2:A>
They see grave threats to our rule of law to our elected legislature and to the Bill of Rights <,> but they no longer see the bright future held out to us in the Joint Declaration <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#73:2:A>
So what are we the people of Hong Kong to do <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#74:2:A>
First we must recognize that we cannot simply leave it to Britain to resolve our problems with China

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#75:2:A>
The hollow agreements the Foreign Secretary Rifkind recently claimed to have made <?> in </?> Beijing related to matters which should long have been agreed on by the joint liaison group <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#76:2:A>
But on the most crucial problems in the hearts of all Hong Kong people namely the threatened replacement of the elected Legco with an appointed provisional one <,> the threaten emasculation of a Bill of Rights and the numerous threats to press freedom <,> Mr Rifkind had nothing to offer but the pious hope that China would somehow change her mind over these matters

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#77:2:A>
Instead of depending on Britain then we must begin tackling these problems ourselves

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#78:2:A>
We must stand together and fight for our future as one <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#79:2:A>
When I was a member of the Basic Law Drafting Committee on two separate occasions mainland officials made the point of telling me privately to keep standing up for Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#80:2:A>
These officials clearly understood the importance of having people in Hong Kong willing and ready to fight to preserve our system and way of life

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#81:2:A>
Indeed this must be what paramount leader Deng Zhao <?> Ping </?> had in mind when he articulated the one country two systems formula in the Joint Declaration

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#82:2:A>
The two systems part of the equation clearly requires all Hong Kong to stand together to fight for our much smaller system <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#83:2:A>
Think for one minute of the see-saw balancing game that we all used to play as children

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#84:2:A>
If a heavy adult is playing see-saw with a much smaller child the game will only work if the adult moves forward and the child moves back then they can maintain equilibrium

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#85:2:A>
Likewise for the one country two systems formula

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#86:2:A>
Hong Kong and China have got to achieve a proper balance

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#87:2:A>
First Hong Kong people must put our weight together as a community

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#88:2:A>
We must stand together for our system and our way of life

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#89:2:A>
Then the leaders of China must help us to stay together and keep their hands off

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#90:2:A>
A good example is the recent Bill of Rights controversy

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#91:2:A>
Once the preliminary working committee  ' s proposals to emasculate the Bill of Rights and restore a number of colonial laws were announced <,> Hong Kong people across all political strata united to explain to China that removing human rights protections would be a devastating blow to confidence <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#92:2:A>
Of course we may not necessarily succeed

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#93:2:A>
But by working together we have certainly made a good start <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#94:2:A>
But ultimately it is for China to decide whether she really wants one country two systems to succeed

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#95:2:A>
If she does China must begin by trusting the people of Hong Kong <,> for trust is the only way to restore the confidence of Hong Kong people in the future <,> and trust on both sides is the only way to get the see-saw game going </I>

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#96:3:A>
When I was invited to the SAR Preparatory Committee I knew as little about it as you did

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#97:3:A>
The reason is that on the one hand it is something new and on the other hand there  ' s no orientation and introduction for the Committee members

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#98:3:A>
I could only base on the general guideline given in the appendix of the Basic Law to guess about how it <.> i </.> how it would operate

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#99:3:A>
After the first general meeting and the sub-committee meetings about the first SAR chief executive and the setting up of the election committee concerned I am gathered some <.> pa </.> preliminary impression about the Preparatory Committee

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#100:3:A>
First operation <,> the main purpose of the Committee is to exchange opinion on various important subjects related to the SAR

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#101:3:A>
My impression is that there are two levels of facilitating opinions exchange

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#102:3:A>
The first level is the committee section

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#103:3:A>
I have an impression that at this level members are <?> rarely rarely </?> free and keen to express their views

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#104:3:A>
As by <?> well </?> developed one <.> an </.> or just some ideas coming up for brainstorming

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#105:3:A>
Sometimes the points raised are rather controversial and generate quite a lot of discussion

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#106:3:A>
However such a discussion are always very courteous one and members are very polite

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#107:3:A>
You may rarely find sparks <?> ignited </?> as we may frequently see in local committee work

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#108:3:A>
The second level is the General Meeting

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#109:3:A>
I have attend such an occasion for once only

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#110:3:A>
However the impression I have was rather uncomfortable

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#111:3:A>
There was no agenda item no standing order no discussion

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#112:3:A>
For the two motions for discussion the <?> process </?> was the same

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#113:3:A>
It began with an officer from the Secretariat to read aloud a discussion paper then the chairman of the meeting will proceeded to ask members to vote for or against the paper on table

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#114:3:A>
I have intended to have some further discussion on some of the points made by the paper however I was not even give a chance to show I have such an intention

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#115:3:A>
To the leaders of the committee the General Meeting is a place for decision it literally means that there  ' s no place for discussion

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#116:3:A>
Second <?> minority </?> in the Committee

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#117:3:A>
From the first few meetings I have an impression that there are in general four types of members

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#118:3:A>
The first type is those Chinese officials who rarely speak anything

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#119:3:A>
The second type are those officials from the Shuen Wah News Agencies and the Hong Kong and Macao office who <?> uh </?> speak sometimes

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#120:3:A>
The third type are those members from Hong Kong who will speak quite frequently though they are apparently did not have an comprehensive master proposal

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#121:3:A>
They did appear to have very good coordination and have much mutual understanding and support

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#122:3:A>
The fourth type are those independent members including Cheung Ka Man and I

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#123:3:A>
We too <&> perhaps-two </&> have all our opinions presented in proposals

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#124:3:A>
We did our homework <?> thoroughly </?> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#125:3:A>
Our proposals spell out the objectives directions and down to the earth operational details

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#126:3:A>
However maybe our value systems and the interests we represent are quite different from that <?> of </?> the majority

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#127:3:A>
And I am afraid we have not fetched much response from those members yet <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#128:3:A>
Third support for the Committee members

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#129:3:A>
The support we have has been very minimal

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#130:3:A>
For the first meeting I failed to gain the Secretariat  ' s cooperation to distribute my proposal to other members

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#131:3:A>
Besides this the agenda arrive at the eleventh hour just the night before the meeting

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#132:3:A>
However the Secretariat has promised to improve on this point

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#133:3:A>
The Secretariat will set up an office in Hong Kong as well

<ICE-HK:S2B-026#134:3:A>
We just hope to know more about the structure the operation as early as possible and we look forward to see <?> it </?> facilitating the work of the Committee as well as lending more support to the Committee members too </I>
