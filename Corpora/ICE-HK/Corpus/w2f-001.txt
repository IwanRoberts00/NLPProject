NICOLE WONG CHUN CHI </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#2:1>
BACK STREET </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-001#3:1>
&ldquo; Papa , where are we ? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#4:1>
&ldquo; At the back street , at the end of the street we live in .
&rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#5:1>
&ldquo; Why are we here ? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#6:1>
&ldquo; Because I have to come here . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#7:1>
&ldquo; Why do you have to come here ? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#8:1>
&ldquo; I come here to play . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#9:1>
&ldquo; Can I play here too ? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#10:1>
Papa raised his other hand .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#11:1>
I struggled to tear my hand out from his .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#12:1>
He was standing against the sun &semi; his face was dark .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#13:1>
I drew a deep breath to stop myself crying .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#14:1>
I did not want to be slapped on the cheek .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#15:1>
&ldquo; We  ' re going up to a flat .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#16:1>
I  ' ll take you to have dessert later .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#17:1>
And don't tell anyone that we have come here today .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#18:1>
Did you hear me ? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#19:1>
I nodded .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#20:1>
My head was heavy .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#21:1>
I kept trying to tear my hand out from his and turn around &dash; if
I ran inside the crowd Papa could probably not catch me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#22:1>
It was just one street .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#23:1>
It is the &lsquo; Women  ' s Street &rsquo; in Mong Kok .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#24:1>
The whole street is a fair , where people are always thronging back
and forth , grabbing and bargaining over the cheapest goods .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#25:1>
Clocks , watches , accessories , bags , clothes &dash; the panties
with pink fur .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#26:1>
Mama yelled at me when I asked her if she had got any . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-001#27:1>
It was no use running home .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#28:1>
Grandpa and Mama were working .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#29:1>
Grandma had gone out .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#30:1>
I could not go to my neighbour .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#31:1>
I had had a fight with XiXi the day before .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#32:1>
Maybe I could get lost in the crowd .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#33:1>
Then when Papa found me , he would be crying and would not beat me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#34:1>
But I did not want Mama to cry .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#35:1>
The only time I got lost I went to a policeman .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#36:1>
The moment I saw Mama again I grinned and thought she would praise me
, but she just held me and cried .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#37:1>
&ldquo; My life is hard enough ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#38:1>
Her tears rolled down to my forehead .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#39:1>
Mine rolled down too but I wiped them away at once .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#40:1>
Mama would cry harder if she knew I had been crying also . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-001#41:1>
So we came to this back street .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#42:1>
Trash was spilling out from the black plastic bags .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#43:1>
Soft drink cans , plastic bottles , paper boxes &dash; red and orange
, blue and green &dash; the colors clashed with one another and the smell of
rotten food .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#44:1>
Next to the trash was a metal gate .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#45:1>
The sun shone on the silver but not the rust .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#46:1>
Above the gate were the think black frames and old posters of movie
stars on the windowpane .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#47:1>
On the walls torn pasted advertisements blew lightly in the wind .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#48:1>
They read : second-hand cars for sale .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#49:1>
I must have made some of these details up .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#50:1>
But I have come back from time to time to make sure it is the right
back street , and it does not look much different from how I remember it to
be .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#51:1>
Papa pushed the gate open .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#52:1>
I could hardly see the stairs .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#53:1>
So I clenched Papa  ' s hand .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#54:1>
&ldquo; Why are you pouting ? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#55:1>
Papa  ' s voice was soft again , &ldquo; Mind your step . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#56:1>
I smiled .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#57:1>
Then I stopped at once .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#58:1>
&ldquo; Ahhhh the stairs are so long !

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#59:1>
It takes all my strength away .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#60:1>
How can I have fun then ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#61:1>
I had never seen Papa giggle like that .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#62:1>
I was panting too but I did not want Papa to know .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#63:1>
We might be climbing up the stairs , panting in the dark forever .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#64:1>
We would never get out from this building .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#65:1>
It should be better than lying dead in the Woman Street .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#66:1>
I would scare those hawkers to death .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#67:1>
Papa and Mama always fell sound asleep before I did .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#68:1>
Sitting between them , I could not help looking out of the windows .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#69:1>
But the stairs ended .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#70:1>
There stood another metal gate , painted in green .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#71:1>
The dark brown of the wooden door looked like dark red &dash; like
blood that had dried &dash; in the very dim light .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#72:1>
Father strode towards the door and pressed the doorbell which was
covered with dirt and fingerprints .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#73:1>
&ldquo; Honey , I  ' m coming ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#74:1>
Papa drew his hand out from mine , &ldquo; Hey sweetie , hurry up !
&rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#75:1>
So the blood melted .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#76:1>
A pair of fake eyelashes was flashing behind the gate .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#77:1>
The eyeline and eyeshadow had melted into a thin dark circle .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#78:1>
As she opened the gate , Papa started giggling again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#79:1>
&ldquo; Hey sweetie , how have you been ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#80:1>
Busy ? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#81:1>
&ldquo; Yes , so many customers today .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#82:1>
Oh , why did you bring this little girl with you ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#83:1>
Is this your daughter ? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#84:1>
&ldquo; Yeah , &rdquo; Papa dragged me into the flat and we sat down
on the sofa .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#85:1>
&ldquo; Her mom has to work today and I have to look after her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#86:1>
So troublesome . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#87:1>
&ldquo; Why bother to have a family then ? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#88:1>
The woman closed the door and leant against it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#89:1>
She was wearing a purple , semi-transparent dress and brick red
lipstick , &ldquo; You can always have fun here , right ? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#90:1>
&ldquo; Of course ! My wife can never do the things that you can .
&rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#91:1>
Papa stood up , strode towards her and held her by her waist .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#92:1>
As Papa leant forward to kiss her she gently pushed him away .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#93:1>
&ldquo; Let  ' s take a shower first . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#94:1>
She was smiling into Papa  ' s eyes , then she glanced at me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#95:1>
&ldquo; Oh , no , let  ' s deal with your daughter first . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#96:1>
Now she stared right at me , &ldquo; Little sweetheart , will you be
a good girl ? Just sit here on the sofa , don't run around or touch anything .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#97:1>
If you  ' re bored , just watch the streets .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#98:1>
Papa will take you home soon , ok ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#99:1>
Oh , by the way , how old are you ? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#100:1>
&ldquo; Four . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#101:1>
My voice was trembling .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#102:1>
I often saw Papa with different women .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#103:1>
Sometimes it was the same woman .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#104:1>
Sometimes it was a new one .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#105:1>
They all asked the same question , &ldquo; Has your Papa taken you
to see another woman ? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#106:1>
I always said &ldquo; No &rdquo; as Papa told me to .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#107:1>
And I did not want to upset them .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#108:1>
Sometimes they told me how I looked and acted when I was a baby .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#109:1>
I thought they liked me because of Papa .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#110:1>
But this woman had been staring at me hard till I sat up on the sofa
and looked out of the windows .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#111:1>
Her voice was so thin that I wanted to cover my ears .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#112:1>
I had never imagined seeing Papa with such a woman .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#113:1>
I had to clench my fists to stop myself from shivering .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#114:1>
I had to look at the sky &semi; the cars moving on the road &semi;
the pedestrians walking on the zebra crossing &dash; to forget the sound of
the shower . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-001#115:1>
The door opened .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#116:1>
I turned around and sat down on the sofa , my ankles on my knees ,
my hands on my ears .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#117:1>
A door closed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#118:1>
I stopped shivering .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#119:1>
So I put my hands down and scratched some plastic off the black sofa
with my fingernails .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#120:1>
There were lots of scratches on the white walls .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#121:1>
Some longer ones were filled with dirt .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#122:1>
In front of the sofa was a white plastic table .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#123:1>
As I stood up I saw a bowl of soaked noodles and a pair of
chopsticks .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#124:1>
Next to the bowl lay a heap of magazines .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#125:1>
Noise was coming out from the room in the dark corridor .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#126:1>
It thundered in my ears but I had given up covering them .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#127:1>
This woman had her whole body bound with ropes , and she was
spreading her legs .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#128:1>
Papa was growling and the woman screaming .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#129:1>
I knew what they were doing , but I could not picture it in my head .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#130:1>
Now a woman was squeezing her breasts .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#131:1>
I stood there and read on .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#132:1>
The noise stopped .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#133:1>
I jumped up to the sofa at once and knelt there , looking out of the
windows .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#134:1>
The clouds were moving fast in the sky .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#135:1>
I heard Papa  ' s footsteps and begged myself to weep , or at least
look shocked .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#136:1>
&ldquo; Hey , girl , &rdquo; Papa was combing his hair with his
fingers , &ldquo; we  ' re going . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#137:1>
I sat still gazing at Papa , although I knew I could stand up at
once .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#138:1>
There came the woman , her semi-transparent dress swaying under the
fan .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#139:1>
She grinned .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#140:1>
This grin was different from those of other women whom Papa went out
with .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#141:1>
But it did not matter .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#142:1>
I was waiting for Papa to look at me again , but he was smiling and
whispering something in the woman  ' s ears .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#143:1>
I had seen Papa doing this to women for a good many times .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#144:1>
Maybe a man always does this to a woman other than his wife .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#145:1>
&ldquo; Now , girl , &rdquo; Papa dragged me up from the sofa ,
&ldquo; we  ' re going to have dessert .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#146:1>
Don't mention this to anyone , not even Mama , ok ? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#147:1>
I nodded .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#148:1>
I always told Mama that it was only Papa and I when we went out .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#149:1>
I did not lie because Papa told me to .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#150:1>
I did not want to share the bed with Papa alone .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#151:1>
The woman hugged Papa and pinched my cheek as she said &ldquo;
Goodbye ! &rdquo; to me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#152:1>
The blood melted again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#153:1>
Papa pushed the green metal gate and closed it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#154:1>
I was glad that he forgot to hold my hand as we walked down the
stairs . </p> </I>

<I> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#155:2>
ASH </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-001#156:2>
<it> Either Chun Chun threw up the milk , or I spilt some of it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#157:2>
The sock is getting loose and it  ' s easy to pull the box out now .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#158:2>
I love watching its shape moving out from the red sock &semi; the
sock expanding , letting the box come out .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#159:2>
&ldquo; Crack . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#160:2>
I like the sound and the smell of wood when I open it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#161:2>
The ash moves like waves on my palm . I scratch a little of it to
taste .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#162:2>
Then I press my fingernail against the tip of my tongue till I can
taste the blood .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#163:2>
It  ' s Chun Chun  ' s blood too .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#164:2>
Relatives say I shouldn't keep the ash at home , or the soul will
linger around the place and won't go to its next life .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#165:2>
That I should take it to a temple for its peace of mind , or at
least spread it over the sea .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#166:2>
But I  ' ll keep it and suck it everyday .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#167:2>
Through the sleepless nights I felt him grow inside me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#168:2>
Then I cradled him till his faint breathing finally stopped .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#169:2>
Now I must have him all in me again. </it> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-001#170:2>
&ldquo; Hang on ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#171:2>
I ran and banged the lift  ' s door .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#172:2>
No one pressed the DO button or glanced at me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#173:2>
I struggled for space but they pushed me against the doors , my bag
crushing my chest .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#174:2>
The warm yellow light slid on the steel , which felt cold on my
cheek .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#175:2>
&ldquo; The ninth floor . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#176:2>
People rushed out .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#177:2>
As I ran to my office I groped in my pocket for a rubber band to tie
up my hair .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#178:2>
Yesterday when I was drinking a glass of water before I started
working , Mrs. Godzilla put a big file on my desk .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#179:2>
&ldquo; Two minutes to go . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#180:2>
Everyone in this office except Mrs. Tsui , the accountant , and me
kept looking at the clock when they came back .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#181:2>
They would go into the washroom &semi; make a cup of coffee , have
their breakfasts .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#182:2>
When they started working I knew it was exactly 9:00 a.m .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#183:2>
My friends all laughed at my work .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#184:2>
&ldquo; You have to measure the height of the flowers ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#185:2>
They won't grow , will they ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#186:2>
And what difference does it make to take pictures of them from
different angles ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#187:2>
Exporter of plastic flowers !

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#188:2>
What a company ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#189:2>
I pushed open the door to see my two bosses talking in their room .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#190:2>
Mr. G was sitting on the chair and Mrs. G was walking around , one
hand in her pocket , one on her forehead .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#191:2>
I saw this scene once .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#192:2>
That afternoon our old manager , Mr. Ho , took leave to take care of
his sick wife again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#193:2>
I heard that it took a long time to make up the excuses to let him
go though .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#194:2>
There were new samples to label and data to enter .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#195:2>
I tidied up my desk as usual , and switched on the computer .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#196:2>
No , Mrs. G had never been particularly unkind to me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#197:2>
I was just a high school graduate , a temporary clerk who had no
working experience .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#198:2>
The sunken cheeks of Mr. Ho popped up on the monitor .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#199:2>
My heart started .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#200:2>
Then I heard footsteps .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#201:2>
&ldquo; Good morning , Julia ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#202:2>
&ldquo; Good morning , <-> Mr.</-> <+> Mrs. </+> Tsui . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#203:2>
I smiled at her when she walked past my seat , then turned away from
the two girls coming in .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#204:2>
On my second day of work I made a few typing mistakes and caused
them some trouble .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#205:2>
&ldquo; Well , some people don't have their brains . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#206:2>
They grabbed me by my shoulders to turn me around , &ldquo; Don't
you think so , Julia ? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#207:2>
I took their hands away and smiled , then turned around to finish my
work .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#208:2>
Kelly , our manager , giggled .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#209:2>
Alex , our graphics director , was in another room .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#210:2>
Most of the time they gossiped about Mr. and Mrs. G. , or about the
person who was not present .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#211:2>
It  ' d been two months but I talked to them only when I had to , and
I seldom went out with them for lunch .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#212:2>
Today , when I was about to eat , Mrs. Tsui tapped me on the
shoulder .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#213:2>
&ldquo; Let me buy you lunch today . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#214:2>
We went down to the canteen at the lower ground floor .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#215:2>
Mrs. Tsui went queuing up at the cashier , smiling at everyone .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#216:2>
On many days we had stayed in the office alone , eating our lunch
boxes at our seats , talking from a distance .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#217:2>
After lunch , Mrs. Tsui did her daily exercise .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#218:2>
Her face toward the ceiling , her shoulders and arms stretched , she
gave out an &lsquo; eeeeek ! &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#219:2>
Then she lowered her head to grin at me , and started flinging her
legs .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#220:2>
&ldquo; If I have a daughter , I wouldn't want her to look like me
&dash; short and large , and a face which would pass by unnoticed in the
street .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#221:2>
I  ' d want her to look like you . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#222:2>
&ldquo; I  ' d wish your kids as healthy as you are .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#223:2>
&rdquo; I walked around the office , reading a novel .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#224:2>
Then we glanced at each other and smiled .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#225:2>
But I had never imagined going out for lunch with Mrs. Tsui .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#226:2>
Then she came to the table with the dishes on the tray .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#227:2>
&ldquo; I would have told you yesterday , but you didn't come to
work .... I  ' m pregnant ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#228:2>
&ldquo; Congratulations ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#229:2>
I struggled to grin and started eating , as Mrs. Tsui talked : how
she realized it &semi; how her family reacted &semi; what the doctor said .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#230:2>
She didn't stop smiling till she put down the chopsticks .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#231:2>
&ldquo; It  ' s time .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#232:2>
I  ' m twenty-nine . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#233:2>
She stared straight into my eyes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#234:2>
&ldquo; It  ' s the one thing I want in life : a happy family .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#235:2>
My husband loves me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#236:2>
I get along well with my <indig> nai nai </indig> <fnr> &asterisk;
</fnr> and relatives .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#237:2>
<footnote> &asterisk; Mother-in-law in Cantonese </footnote>

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#238:2>
Now it  ' s kids . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#239:2>
I nodded .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#240:2>
&ldquo; But I  ' ll still be working .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#241:2>
Money is tight for us .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#242:2>
And you know it  ' s expensive to have a kid now .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#243:2>
I don't mind my work or the people in the office .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#244:2>
You always have to cope with the bad in life .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#245:2>
Just try to stay happy . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#246:2>
I ached to listen and to smile .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#247:2>
So I peeped at the watch .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#248:2>
&ldquo; I think we  ' d better go now . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#249:2>
Men in blue uniforms were climbing up and down the containers .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#250:2>
Mrs. Tsui smiled at me on the way to the lifts , but I looked at the
grey walls .

<ICE-HK:W2F-001#251:2>
This stretch of road had never seemed so long . </p> </I>
