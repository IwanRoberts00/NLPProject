<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-046#82:1:B>
Thank you Henry

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#83:1:B>
Uhm I  ' m taking your hint I should be brief

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#84:1:B>
Uh and uh I would like to thank Mr Stephen Lam for insisting that
uh we get on to this uh platform uh sharing <unc> one-word </unc> our
experiences in terms of environmental control with you

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#85:1:B>
Uhm <,> some of you may remember the uh opening of this uh Business
and Industry Week <?> not that </?> <unc> one word </unc> <?> query
</?> why he was uh invited to open this this <?> Week </?>

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#86:1:B>
He wondered whether uh people suspect he knows uh something about
environmental control <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#87:1:B>
Well indeed he does

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#88:1:B>
He does know one or two things about environmental control because
<?> ANSI </?> Utility providing a service to uh people in Hong Kong <?> and
</?> particularly in Kowloon and New Territories

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#89:1:B>
Uh our activities do have an impact on the environment and the
<unc> two-words </unc> has been involved in the development of the
company

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#90:1:B>
So it is very much closely involved in all the activities to uh
control environmental impact uh arising from <?> all the </?> activities

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#91:1:B>
Uh the company has a policy in terms of environmental control <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#92:1:B>
We will conduct our business in a balanced manner which is
compatible with the environmental social and economic needs of this <unc>
one-word </unc> community

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#93:1:B>
So what we <.> w w </.> realize that any action that we take would
have an impact but <unc> two words </unc> counter measure will
probably give rise to other problems so we do have to <,> take a balanced
view <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#94:1:B>
Uh in the next few minutes allocated to me I would like to share
some of our activities in terms of uh power <.> cons </.> uh power stations
its uh construction operation and also impact it has on the uh environment
and what measures we have adopted to control this uh this impact <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#95:1:B>
At the moment we have uh three power stations

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#96:1:B>
Uh one is at <?> Hok Yuen </?>

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#97:1:B>
This is uh old power station which was developed in the nineteen
fifties and sixties <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#98:1:B>
Next one is on Tsing Yi Island

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#99:1:B>
The third one is at Castle Peak

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#100:1:B>
We are building a small power station on Lantau Island

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#101:1:B>
This is a <unc> two words </unc> power station

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#102:1:B>
It is a very small one used basically to uh uh meet emergency
needs of uh to to provide sort of standby power <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#103:1:B>
The early power station at <?> Hok Yuen </?> is a very old station
as I have mentioned

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#104:1:B>
Uh it was developed in the fifties and sixties

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#105:1:B>
At that time this area was classified <?> as long </?> as an light
industrial area

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#106:1:B>
So neighbours were factories uhm dockyards uh business like that

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#107:1:B>
But increasingly this area is now uhm changing into a residential
recreation area

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#108:1:B>
So we found that power station uh sitting in between the uh uh uh
uh residential units is becoming very incompatible

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#109:1:B>
It is also getting old

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#110:1:B>
So it is now being <,> dismantled and some of the machines will be
relocated to <?> the </?> existing power stations

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#111:1:B>
So by next year uh this will disappear

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#112:1:B>
The power station will disappear

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#113:1:B>
This place uh some of you may know that we have asked Cheung Kong
to help re-develop this area into a residential and recreational uh facility
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#114:1:B>
The Tsing Yi power station was built in the sixties <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#115:1:B>
When it was when we <.> con </.> when we start to plan for the
Castle Peak power station in the middle of nineteen seventies we start to
have a well <?> sort </?> out comprehensive environmental control program for
power stations

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#116:1:B>
And by nineteen seventy seven nineteen seventy eight we did the
first comprehensive environmental impact study before we got to the
construction stage

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#117:1:B>
So this power station uh which the the first unit the first unit
of <?> the </?> electricity was generated in nineteen eighty two

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#118:1:B>
It was completed in nineteen ninety

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#119:1:B>
The whole power station was completed in ninety eight nineteen
ninety

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#120:1:B>
Uh we got through eight nine years of development for the power
station

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#121:1:B>
We now have a very comprehensive program uh in monitoring the
operation of the power station monitoring the <?> and </?> on the impact of
the power station and continue to uh research and investigate new
technologies which can be used to further minimize the environmental impact
from the power station

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#122:1:B>
So the next few minutes I would like to introduce to you what we
did in the <.> environmen </.> impacts of the uh what we are doing now to
monitor its performance and that will lead me uh before I conclude to the new
power station which we are proposing <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#123:1:B>
This is a picture of the new Castle Peak power station

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#124:1:B>
Some of you may have the chance have visited it

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#125:1:B>
We welcome people to come and see it

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#126:1:B>
Uhm it doesn't look like a power station uh from some of the
comments uh given to us by the visitors

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#127:1:B>
It is a <unc> two words </unc> power station

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#128:1:B>
But uh it is uh it is kept very clean

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#129:1:B>
It is part of the culture uh we can keep it clean

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#130:1:B>
We are very conscious of uh whatever impact it will have on the
environment <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#131:1:B>
The environmental impact study <,> is made up of five parts visual
uh aspect of the power station

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#132:1:B>
The uh program to control solid waste disposal uh noise that will
come from the operation of the power station

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#133:1:B>
Water pollution because we use sea water to cool the uh the
machines uh and air pollution basically what will come out from the chimneys

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#134:1:B>
As far as the visual part is concerned it  ' s relatively easy as
you saw in that picture I just show you

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#135:1:B>
Uh it is a <unc> one-word </unc> design landscaped area

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#136:1:B>
There is not much noise coming from the power station and is kept
quite apart from the urban centers

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#137:1:B>
But we do have a village next <.> sto </.> uh next to us

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#138:1:B>
It  ' s about one or two kilometers from the power station

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#139:1:B>
Uh there are maybe two hundred houses there so we do have to make
sure the power station does not create <?> a </?> noise source for the
villagers <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#140:1:B>
Uh I will like to in the next few slides discuss other than this
visual aspect and the noise aspect some of the other measures that we take to
control the uhm the problem

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#141:1:B>
When we start with the planning we built a uh model of the power
station and the area in the uh Castle Peak uh Tuen <?> Muen </?> area

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#142:1:B>
This is the power station

<ICE-HK:S2B-046#143:1:B>
We put the whole model into a wind tunnel to decide uh whether
smoke coming from the chimney uh will have <.> an </.> any impact on the area
</I>
