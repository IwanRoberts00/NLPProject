<bold> Product: </bold> Zire 71

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#4:1>
<bold> Price: </bold> HK&dollar;2,380

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#5:1>
<bold> Pros: </bold> Bright and clear screen , newest Palm OS ,
relatively cheap

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#6:1>
<bold> Cons: </bold> Slow processor , slow shutter speed , a bit bulky
</h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#7:1>

<p> Palm has learned well from previous incarnations of its entry-level
personal digital assistants , among them the cheap but dismally bare Palm
m100 . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#8:1>

<p> Most were woefully short on random access memory .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#9:1>
And some , such as the m100 , did not allow e-mail . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#10:1>

<p> The Zire 71 sports a Texas Instruments 144-megahertz processor , 16
megabytes of Ram and 4MB of read-only memory running its most up-to-date
Operating System 5.2.1 . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#11:1>

<p> The beautifully bright and sharp screen makes it a big improvement on its
older sibling , the Tungsten T . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#12:1>

<p> But make no mistake , the newest Zire is still an entry-level Palm . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#13:1>

<p> Those who say Palms have speedy processors may think otherwise when the
most basic multi-tasking comes into play .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#14:1>
For example , run an MP3 on RealOne player &obrack; the Zire 71  ' s OS
5.2.1 also allows video clips to be played &cbrack; , then try reading some
downloaded Web pages through a client such as Advantgo .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#15:1>
Things almost grind to a halt . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#16:1>

<p> The Zire 71 boasts a built-in digital camera that emerges as you slide
down the metal back cover .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#17:1>
Initially it is fun to zoom around and snap pictures of anything and
everything , but the device can feel like an encumbrance when you switch back
to an ultra-compact digital camera . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#18:1>


<p> The quality of the low resolution &obrack; maximum 640x480 pixels
&cbrack; pictures is surprisingly good .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#19:1>
The device makes intelligent corrections automatically , so the user
can just point and shoot .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#20:1>
Shutter speeds are slow , requiring a steady hand .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#21:1>
There is also an annoying half-second delay between pressing the
shutter button and actually taking the picture . </p> </I>

<bold> IN FOCUS </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#24:2>
<bold> When four young friends published a list on the Internet of
Hong Kong buildings where virus infections had been confirmed , they hardly
expected to force government policy , writes Chloe Lai </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#25:2>
When it became clear that the atypical pneumonia outbreak had
spread from hospitals into the community , pressure began to build on the
Hong Kong government to publish details of where infected cases had been
recorded . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#26:2>
But it was not until a month after the alarming spread of the
disease at the Amoy Gardens estate in Ngau Tau Kok , where more than 300
people have been infected , that the Department of Health agreed to take such
a step . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#27:2>
It made the announcement on April 9 and two days later the
department  ' s Web site began carrying the growing list of buildings where
confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome &obrack; Sars &cbrack;
had been found . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#28:2>
Although the government never admitted it , the public perception
is that the move was prompted by an independent Web site which had , for more
than a week , providing details of Sars hot spots , including the names of
buildings where infections had been confirmed .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#29:2>
The Web site was appropriately named www.sosick.org . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#30:2>
The four information technology engineers who launched the site
on March 31 never thought their project would have an impact on government
policy or draw them into the media spotlight . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#31:2>
It all began with Edwin Chan Tak-kay  ' s fears .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#32:2>
&ldquo; I didn't feel all right with the government  ' s assurances .
Everybody in Hong Kong knew the virus was spreading but the government was
saying it was just in the hospitals and had only affected medical staff .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#33:2>
I thought they must be hiding something from us , so I thought I
needed to do something to protect myself from being infected , &rdquo; he
said .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#34:2>
He shared this idea with his three friends , Bernard Chung Chi-shing
, John Lau Kwok-wai and Nelson Kwan Chun-fai .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#35:2>
The four have known each other since attending the University of
Adelaide in Australia together . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#36:2>
They decided to compile a list of all the infected areas on the
Internet so their friends and relatives would know which areas of Hong Kong
to avoid . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#37:2>
&ldquo; We thought the easiest way for an individual to protect
themselves was to avoid some of the dangerous areas .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#38:2>
We tried to figure out where these places are but we couldn't find
them , they were not available on the government Web site , &rdquo; explained
Mr Chung . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#39:2>
The four agreed to name the Web site , www.sosick.org . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#40:2>
Mr Chan had registered the site name more than a year ago , well
before the Sars outbreak - but had no particular plan in mind .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#41:2>
At the time , he had no idea how appropriate the name would become ,
or how useful the site could be . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#42:2>
He explained that the inspiration for the name came from the
northern Song dynasty poet Su Shi &obrack; 1037-1101 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#43:2>
The pronunciation of the poet  ' s name in Cantonese sounds like ` so
sick ' in English . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#44:2>
&ldquo; The name struck me and I just found it interesting that
the poet  ' s name , if translated into English , has that meaning , so I
registered a Web site under this name , just for fun , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#45:2>
The four friends started gathering all available information on
infected buildings and posting it on the www.sosick.org site . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#46:2>
&ldquo; In the beginning , we just had Amoy Gardens and Sha Tin .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#47:2>
Some of the information was from newspapers , some were from friends
, &rdquo; said Mr Chung . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#48:2>
But word soon spread and it became clear that the site was
meeting a public need .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#49:2>
Within two days , the hit rate on the site climbed to more than
100,000 and the e-mails the four received increased from a few in the
beginning to more than 100 a day .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#50:2>
Only then did they begin to realise that their circle of family and
friends were not the only people visiting the site .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#51:2>
On April 10 , just before the government announced it would release
the name of the infected buildings , sosick recorded a hit rate of more than
200,000 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#52:2>
The number of e-mails the four received over that period also rose
from 100 a day to more than 1,000 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#53:2>
&ldquo; Most of them were telling us which buildings had
residents who had been infected , some were thank you letters or letter of
encouragement , &rdquo; said Mr Chung . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#54:2>
The Web site recorded the spread of Sars from Amoy Gardens to the
nearby Lower Ngau Tau Kok Estate a week before this became generally known .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#55:2>
The site  ' s popularity was matched by its credibility .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#56:2>
It not only informed the public by revealing a list of infected
buildings , those compiling the information took steps to ensure it was
accurate . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#57:2>
All those who provided information were asked to attach with
their e-mails either newspaper articles , which clearly publicised the names
of the infected buildings , or letters issued by the Department of Health to
the estates ' management about people on an estate being infected with Sars .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#58:2>
Then the four engineers would call a building  ' s estate
management for confirmation .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#59:2>
Only after all the steps had been completed and the information was
confirmed as being correct would the name of the infected building be
uploaded to the Web . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#60:2>
&ldquo; We were never rejected when we called the estate
management for confirmation .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#61:2>
People were pretty helpful in response to our queries , &rdquo; said
Mr Chung . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#62:2>
In fact , it was a mistake that made them realise the importance
of obtaining proof and cross-checking the information they received .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#63:2>
Early on , they placed the name of a commercial building in Mongkok
on the Web , stating that somebody working there was infected .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#64:2>
But shortly afterwards , they received a complaint from the
management of the building , telling them this was incorrect . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#65:2>
Completing all the steps from clearing e-mails to updating the
address list meant each of the four needed to work five to six hours every
night after they returned home from work . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#66:2>
Since the government began producing detailed lists , sosick has
not been updating its information . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#67:2>
&ldquo; I am glad we don't have to do the update any more .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#68:2>
Five to six hours is a lot of work , &rdquo; said Mr Chung .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#69:2>
&ldquo; Imagine , I am usually home around eight and since I live
alone , I have to cook and eat first . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#70:2>
It never occurred to the group to attempt to make money out of
the site . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#71:2>
&ldquo; All the information is on the Web , anyone can copy it if
they want .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#72:2>
We own no right over the information .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#73:2>
This is public information .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#74:2>
It is available to the public anyway .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#75:2>
Anyone in an infected building can see the government notice in the
lift lobby .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#76:2>
It was just that the government was not putting it together,' ' said
Mr Chung . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#77:2>
The team behind sosick was aware of the need not to breach people
's privacy .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#78:2>
Only the names of infected buildings are posted on the site , not the
affected floor , or the precise address of victims . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#79:2>
Even though sosick has now stopped updating its list , and the
government is publishing up-to-date information , the site remains popular
and continues to receive 30,000 hits a day . </p> </I>

<bold> Sars fears see rise in audio and video conferencing </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#82:3>
Mainland and Hong Kong telecommunications firms offering video
and audio teleconferencing are hoping to boost traffic growth as a result of
the Sars crisis . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#83:3>
AsiaInfo Holdings , a Nasdaq-listed company that provides network
and server solutions to China Unicom , said it expected a turnaround in its
business fortunes on the back of rising demand for video conferencing and
other telecommunications services . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#84:3>
&ldquo; Some of our customers did indicate that their video
conference demand is increasing , most likely due to the reduction in travel
and the caution , &rdquo; chairman James Ding told a group of investors .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#85:3>
Audio rather than video conferencing is proving popular due to
cost advantages . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#86:3>
Industry executives said an hour-long video would cost between
HK&dollar;80,000 and HK&dollar;100,000 , while audio cost a few thousand
dollars per hour . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#87:3>
Wharf T&T vice-president Tony Cheung Tung-lan said audio
conferencing sales had risen 35 per cent since the outbreak of Sars in Hong
Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#88:3>
Popular conferencing locations include the United States ,
Britain , Singapore and China . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#89:3>
&ldquo; We expect audio conferencing traffic to grow , given that
China announced it would cancel the Golden Holiday as the Sars impact widens
, &rdquo; Mr Cheung said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#90:3>
Mr Cheung said Wharf ranked No 2 in audio conferencing in Hong
Kong , behind MCI in a market size estimated at HK&dollar;100 million . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-039#91:3>
PCCW , which provides both audio and video conferencing , said it
had also observed an increase in inquiries for the service . </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Sunday to offer more location alert services after Sars
success </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#93:4>

<p> Sunday Communications plans to add more location-based services &obrack;
LBS &cbrack; , claiming that alerts indicating when a mobile-phone user is in
the vicinity of a Sars-affected building have spurred interest in such
offerings . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#94:4>

<p> Sunday executive director Henry Wong said: &ldquo; Sars raised the
awareness of public safety , and in this process LBS has played an important
role . &rdquo; Sunday launched the first Sars-related service by identifying
virus-affected buildings within a kilometre of a customer , a service that
it claimed was a hit . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#95:4>

<p> Since launching mobile data services , Hong Kong operators have struggled
to find a so-called &ldquo; killer app &rdquo; or even the kind of enthusiasm
shown by users in countries such as Japan . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#96:4>

<p> While Hong Kong is enjoying a boom in short messaging , network operators
are seeking income-generating data services ahead of the launch of
third-generation services , expected by the middle of this year by Hutchison
Telecom . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#97:4>

<p> Sunday hopes to consolidate its apparent success with its Sars alert by
launching another location-based service that alerts users when the calling
party is within 500 metres of the caller . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#98:4>

<p> Such location services are slowly taking off in America and Europe ,
allowing among other things the police to pinpoint distressed callers ringing
emergency numbers . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#99:4>

<p> Increased awareness of terrorist threats after September 11 and the Sars
outbreak meant customers were more focused on personal safety issues , Mr
Wong said . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#100:4>

<p> In Hong Kong , that would manifest itself in users wanting to track their
children and elderly relatives .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#101:4>
For example , parents could receive an alert when their children
arrived at school , he said . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#102:4>

<p> Mobile firms are also looking at business applications such as transport
companies being able to track fleets of trucks in cross-border trade .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#103:4>
Low-cost global positioning services , provided through satellite
transmission , mean they face competition for such services . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#104:4>

<p> Sunday is providing a location-based service for a taxi company ,
allowing it to track its fleet movements .

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#105:4>
The operator offers a similar service for Hong Kong and China Gas ,
allowing its 1,400 off-site workers to be tracked . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-039#106:4>

<p> Mr Wong acknowledged that such offerings were in their commercial infancy
and efforts to alert customers to restaurants , stores and car repair centres
had met limited interest . </p> </I>
