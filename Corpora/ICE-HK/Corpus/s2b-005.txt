<ICE-HK:S2B-005#22:1:A>
Also discussed was Vietnam  ' s economy

<ICE-HK:S2B-005#23:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S2B-005#27:1:A>

Despite one of the largest security efforts in Swedish history <,>
soccer fans once again went on a violent rampage at the European
championships

<ICE-HK:S2B-005#57:1:A>

second largest city with brawling and looting

<ICE-HK:S2B-005#59:1:A>
Violence on the scale we  ' ve seen this past week in Sweden isn't
normally associated with sports and it  ' s not too often that a team can lose
a crucial game in a tournament and still advance to the semi-finals but that  ' s

One of the key leaders of China  ' s communist old guard is dead at
the age of eighty-three

<ICE-HK:S2B-005#67:2:A>
Beijing  ' s official media reported that <?> Li Sin Nian </?> passed
away last night

<ICE-HK:S2B-005#68:2:A>
Li was the Chairman of the People  ' s Political Consultative
Conference and held the position of President for much of the nineteen
eighties

<ICE-HK:S2B-005#69:2:A>
He was known as a conservative hardliner and some analysts say his
death may help Deng Xiao Ping  ' s market reforms

<ICE-HK:S2B-005#70:2:A>
Diana Lin reports

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-005#71:2:B>
<?> Li Sin Nian </?> orthodox communist veteran of the Long
March had not been seen in public since February last year due to frail
health

<ICE-HK:S2B-005#72:2:B>
His only formal post in the last years of his life was as the
Chairman of the Chinese People  ' s Political Consultative Conference

<ICE-HK:S2B-005#73:2:B>
But he was widely seen to play a backstage role as one of the
doyens of the party  ' s conservative camp pitched against Deng Xiao Ping  ' s
market style economic reforms

<ICE-HK:S2B-005#74:2:B>
Lee was one of those who urged the military crackdown on the
nineteen eighty-nine pro-democracy movement

<ICE-HK:S2B-005#75:2:B>
He was one of the so-called eight old men who control China  ' s fate
and the first among them to die

<ICE-HK:S2B-005#76:2:B>
CPPCC member Tsui Xi Min said today Li  ' s death is good news for
Deng Xiao Ping  ' s reforms

<ICE-HK:S2B-005#77:2:B>
It  ' ll mean less resistance to the promotion of reformist cadres

<ICE-HK:S2B-005#78:2:B>
Magazine Chief Editor Li Yi says Li  ' s death would aggravate the
struggle between conservatives and reformists in the revamping of the party
leadership at the fourteenth Party Congress slated for later this year

<ICE-HK:S2B-005#79:2:B>
In his long political career Li had deftly manoeuvred himself to
avoid China  ' s many purges

<ICE-HK:S2B-005#80:2:B>
Born to a poor peasant family in Hubei province in nineteen o nine
Li worked as a carpenter  ' s apprentice and organised uprisings against
landlords

<ICE-HK:S2B-005#81:2:B>
Joining the Communist Party in his late teens he became a Red Army
Commander in the Civil War joining the Long March and later directing sixty
thousand troops against Japanese invaders

<ICE-HK:S2B-005#82:2:B>
Li was also at <?> Yen An </?> where he studied at the university

<ICE-HK:S2B-005#83:2:B>
After the Communist victory in nineteen forty-nine Li  ' s work with
post-war reconstruction in his native province soon brought him to Beijing
and the meteoric rise to Vice Premier and Finance Minister

<ICE-HK:S2B-005#84:2:B>
A self-educated economist Li helped rebuild China  ' s economy

<ICE-HK:S2B-005#85:2:B>
Protected by Premier <?> Jo An Lai </?> Li escaped political
persecution during the Cultural Revolution

<ICE-HK:S2B-005#86:2:B>
After Mao Tse Tung  ' s death Li played a crucial role in the arrest
of the infamous Gang of Four but soon found himself pitched against Deng Xiao
Ping  ' s readjustments away from the Soviet style central planning and heavy
industry Li himself advocated

<ICE-HK:S2B-005#87:2:B>
From nineteen eighty-two to nineteen eighty-seven Li became one of
the five members of China  ' s highest organ of power the Party Politbureau
Standing Committee

<ICE-HK:S2B-005#88:2:B>
And he filled the largely ceremonial post of the country  ' s
President from nineteen eighty-three until nineteen eighty-eight when he was
forced to step down along with many other elderly Marxist veterans in Deng
Xiao Ping  ' s rejuvenation of the hierarchy
