of about 100nm in the visible , the part &hash; and the prices of your PR1
products .

<ICE-HK:W1B-024#136:8>
We have your &ldquo; Laser Optics and Coatings &rdquo; catalogue
&obrack; 1987 &cbrack; in hand , but we failed to distinguish between the PR1
and PR2 product

<ICE-HK:W1B-024#137:8>
Is it meant that PR1 product has relatively narrow bandwidth ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-024#138:8>
Or Your PR2 product is a new items ?

&obrack; 90&percent; &cbrack; and transmitted &obrack; 10&percent; &cbrack;
mirror in the visible range with 1-inch in diameter , 0.25 inch in thickness .

<ICE-HK:W1B-024#141:8>
Please give us the part &hash; and the prices of such PR2 products
if available , so as to make order easily and faster .

<ICE-HK:W1B-024#142:8>
