<bold> The historian  ' s forest of files </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#2:1>
If you ever wish to explore the most arcane information about Hong
Kong  ' s past , Carl T Smith  ' s treasure trove of tidbits is a great place to
start , writes <bold> Amy Wu </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#3:1>
WITHIN the rusty files that line Carl T Smith  ' s walls lie time
capsules of Hong Kong  ' s past and present .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#4:1>
When you slide open the &ldquo; W &rdquo; in his cramped archive in
Mei Foo , the drawer squeaks and sticks .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#5:1>
Packed inside are hundreds of index cards - snapshots of history .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#6:1>
Cuttings form local newspapers have been meticulously copied ,
such as this small item from the mid-19th century: &ldquo; Wu Ching-sui ,
1832 , Nov 29 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#7:1>
Local estate , administered 8 Min Ko Terraces , &dollar;20,300 to
concubine Yeung Shuk-ying . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#8:1>
For many , this trivial piece of information is not worth
recording , but not to 83-year old Smith , who has spent most of his life as
a minister and history buff . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#9:1>
&ldquo; There are two ways to look at history , &rdquo; says Smith
, who started his archive more than 40 years ago .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#10:1>
&ldquo; One is gathering all facts that fir an idea .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#11:1>
That  ' s the way most people do history , that  ' s the PhD way to do it .
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#12:1>
Pausing as he squints through thick glasses , he continues:
&ldquo; The other way , the much longer way , is not to have a thesis or any
particular thing in mind .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#13:1>
You start picking out the facts .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#14:1>
The facts are like twigs and gradually you see that each twig is
connected to a branch .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#15:1>
You begin to see all kinds of stories , and slowly you begin to see
the whole forest . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#16:1>
Smith  ' s homegrown forest is filled with thousands of index cards
, folders and documents containing information on births , birthdays ,
baptisms , engagements , weddings , obituaries , land rates , property
transactions , court records , bankruptcy notes , company notices , thefts
and murders .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#17:1>
The list is endless . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#18:1>
Over 40 years , Smith has painstakingly penned and typed each
piece of information .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#19:1>
Snippets such as this one: &ldquo; February 3 , 1939 , married Hong
Kong Hotel , Chan Wah-chen , seventh daughter of Mr Chan Yee-ho , a
prominent Swatow merchant to Ma Ho-tung , so of Mr Ma Tsak-man , manager of
Hong Kong Swatow Commercial Bank &obrack;  now Asia Commercial Bank]" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#20:1>
For smith , each card is like a narrow window to another age .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#21:1>
The rich rub shoulders with regular fold .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#22:1>
An index card on Gordon Wu , founder of Hopewell Holdings , sits next
to Wu Ching-sui , who is completely unknown to the public . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#23:1>
&ldquo; I have a belief that history is shaped by the common
person , &rdquo; he says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#24:1>
&ldquo; Twigs could be anything from marriage announcements to
obituaries to property transactions , to land records and notices .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#25:1>
You open the newspaper , and you see &obrack;  them &cbrack; . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#26:1>
Smith  ' s own story is worthy of inclusion .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#27:1>
Born in Dayton , Ohio , he fell in love with genealogy after delving
into his family tree during a school assignment when he was 13 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#28:1>
He continued to pursue his hobby while at DePaw University in
Illinois in 1936 and four years later at the Union Theological Seminary in
New York . </p> <O> A photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#29:1>
After spending 13 years as a minister at St Stephen  ' s United
Church of Christ in Pennsylvania , he moved to Hong Kong in 1961 as a
missionary and lecturer on theology at the then Chinese University . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#30:1>
Since the university was short of money , Smith decided to
&ldquo; pursue his lifelong hobby full-time" .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#31:1>
With an inheritance from his father and a succession of part-time
jobs , he was able to pass his days at Hong Kong  ' s public archives . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#32:1>
&ldquo; I  ' d go in at 9.15 in the morning and not even go to
lunch , &rdquo; he recalls .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#33:1>
&ldquo; People could never understand how I could sit there all day
long and look at those records .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#34:1>
To me , it was utterly fascinating , sort of like a jigsaw puzzle .
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#35:1>
To finance his passion , Smith has to live a simple life .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#36:1>
&ldquo; I am not rich , but I live comfortably , &rdquo; he says , as
a fan churns the sticky summer air around in his cramped flat . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#37:1>
His legacy is contained in the thousands of files , the stories .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#38:1>
They may be small pieces of the past , but when they are put together
, a picture develops of the history of areas such as Kennedy Town , Aberdeen
and Sham Shui Po .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#39:1>
The end result is two large historical tomes written by Smith: <it> A
Sense of History - Studies in the Social and Urban History of Hong Kong and
Chinese Christians: Elites , Middlemen , and the Church in Hong Kong </it> .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#40:1>
Smith  ' s &ldquo; hobby &rdquo; has also helped flesh out the
bones on other works of Hong Kong history .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#41:1>
Books such as Frank Ching's <it> The Li Dynasty </it> , Maria
Jaschok's <it> Concubines and Bond Servants </it> , Susanna Hoe's <it> The
Private Life of Old Hong Kong </it> , and , more recently , Vaudine England's
<it> The Quest of Noel Croucher </it> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#42:1>
But while he is willing to share the secrets of his archive ,
smith is also fiercely protective of his collection .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#43:1>
&ldquo; I don't usually let people go trough my archive , &rdquo; he
says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#44:1>
&ldquo; I  ' m frightened everything will get mixed up . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#45:1>
These days he savours his almost monk-like existence in the
two-room flat .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#46:1>
It is the forest of facts he loves most .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#47:1>
&ldquo; All I know is that I  ' ve had a comfortable life , &rdquo;
says Smith , who plans to donate his files to the Library of Congress in
Washington , DC , after his death . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#48:1>
&ldquo; It  ' s very hard for people to understand but ... I love
to do it . It  ' s a full-time hobby . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#49:1>
And a way of life . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#50:2>
<bold> Brushes with history </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#51:2>
Of brushes , ink and paper , calligraphers create momentous works of
art and philosophy .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#52:2>
<bold> Peter Barker </bold> and <bold> Natalie Kan </bold> meet a
premier purveyor of these highly refined tools </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#53:2>
WOLF hair or wool ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#54:2>
Mouse whiskers or tiger tail hairs ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#55:2>
These are the questions that Chinese calligraphy artists and painters
face when selecting just the right brush for their next work .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#56:2>
The man with the answers is Monty Lee Mon-tat , the 38-year old
second-generation owner of the Man Luen Choon Chinese Stationery shop in
Central . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#57:2>
&ldquo; A long wolf-hair brush is the most expensive - as much as
&dollar;7,000 , &rdquo; he says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#58:2>
" The people who buy these are professional artists , and they know
it  ' s worth the money . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#59:2>
The shelves around him are filled with hundreds of brushes , from
delicate items the size of a pencil to heavy-duty jobs that look as if they
would take two hands to pick up and would leave a brushstroke as thick as
your arm .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#60:2>
Most of them are cheaper than the exotic fur models , usually costing
less than &dollar;100 for the standard wool varieties . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#61:2>
Lee says there is a never-ending demand for the tools of the
ancient Chinese arts .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#62:2>
The twin arts of painting and calligraphy are inseparably interwoven
, with the character of a painted poem valued for their graphic appeal as
much as their meaning .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#63:2>
Many painters will add some words or a poem to their work to overlay
their feelings on the visual image . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#64:2>
&ldquo; Many people still practise these arts , &rdquo; Lee says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#65:2>
&ldquo; They learn from the age of 10 onwards and come from many
different walks of life .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#66:2>
We see children , doctors , accountants and lawyers buying brushes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#67:2>
Even Nobel Prize-winner for literature , Gao Xingjian , buys his
brushes here because he can't go to the mainland .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#68:2>
We even mail them to him when he  ' s in France . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#69:2>
Lee counts many of the top painters from the mainland , Taiwan
and Hong Kong among his customers , including the renowned Fan Zeng and even
Anson Chan  ' s mother Fang Zhaoling , a widely acclaimed painter . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#70:2>
The brushes are as varied , coming from the mainland , Taiwan ,
Korea and Japan , so there is something to suit the requirements of every
artist .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#71:2>
&ldquo; Each one has their own style , &rdquo; Lee says . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#72:2>
He pulls out a Guangdong grass brush the size of a kitchen broom .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#73:2>
&ldquo; This one gives a hard effect to the brushstrokes , &rdquo; he
says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#74:2>
It is designed to give a rough , streaked appearance to the ink as it
is laid on the paper .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#75:2>
Similar brushes are made from bamboo and small tree branches shredded
into coarse bristles on one end . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#76:2>
Other artists will choose softer brushes - wool , puma fur , pig
bristles or features - to give a softer effect to their painting or
calligraphy .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#77:2>
Some of them are very specialised: Lee produces a cow-horn handled
brush with lambswool bristles .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#78:2>
&ldquo; This is for painting the lotus leaves , &rdquo; he says ,
pointing to one of the framed prints by famous masters that adorn the store .
</p> <O> A photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#79:2>
Every aspect of painting and calligraphy is equally as
specialised .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#80:2>
Each shelf in Lee  ' s extensive shop is carefully arranged with all
manner of accessories .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#81:2>
The artist  ' s main tool is the brush , but second to that is the
paper .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#82:2>
Rolls and sheets of paper abound , both handmade and machine-produced
from bamboo fibre , cotton or linen . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#83:2>
<bold> Brush tips </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#84:2>
<bold> Those in the know use four well-established criteria to
judge if a brush is up to standard </bold> </p> ?

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#85:2>
The tip should be very finely pointed on a new brush with stiff
bristles . </p> ?

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#86:2>
After soaking in water for 20 minutes , the bristles should splay
out evenly and create a flat , straight end with no sign of a point . </p> ?

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#87:2>
Bristles should be &ldquo; full" , or thick and bushy . </p> ?

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#88:2>
The bristles must be &ldquo; healthy &rdquo; - soft yet with a
springy rebound , so the brush will flex to provide the desired form without
losing its shape . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#89:2>
&ldquo; Handmade is better , &rdquo; Lee says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#90:2>
&ldquo; A good paper will show you seven shades of black and grey &obrack; 
ink &cbrack; . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#91:2>
Most of the traditional Chinese painting is in black ink , with
some mild colour washes used occasionally to add the artist  ' s feelings to a
painting rather than for photographic-style realism . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#92:2>
&ldquo; Henri Matisse  ' s style of painting is very much like
Chinese painting , &rdquo; Lee says , with a flourish towards the hundreds of
art books that line the shop  ' s walls , collections of the Asian masters with
a few selected Westerners - notably Matisse and Picasso - among them .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#93:2>
The black ink outlines and stylised colour washes abound . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#94:2>
The ink itself is the third important element for the painter or
calligrapher .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#95:2>
Made from wood ash , Chinese herbs and a plastic bonding agent , it
comes in a solid block the size of a mobile phone .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#96:2>
Mostly the ink is black , but red is also popular for signwriting and
for Taoist monks to use for writing papers to exorcise spirits . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#97:2>
The most sought-after luck red ink , <it> jiu sa </it> , is as
heavy as iron because of the minerals in it and costs up to &dollar;3,000 for
a small block .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#98:2>
Whatever the colour , the ink is rubbed on the fourth important
element in the artist  ' s set , the ink stone , to grind it into powder .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#99:2>
It is then mixed with water in a depression carved into the ornate
rock . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#100:2>
&ldquo; The good stones are very smooth and don't soak up the
water quickly , &rdquo; Lee explains . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#101:2>
Apart from the essentials , the well-equipped artist will stock
up on the accessories from Lee ' store .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#102:2>
Who would try to get by without brass or ceramic brush-holders made
in the shapes of cherubic figures ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#103:2>
And , of course , a pair of paperweights to hold the parchment flat
are essential .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#104:2>
You can pick from rosewood , marble or even a Japanese brass
rendition of Mount Fuji . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#105:2>
There is no need to get your fingers dirty grinding the ink
block down on the stone when a nifty pair of bamboo tongs will lock on to the
black stuff and save you the both .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#106:2>
And when you have finished your day  ' s doodling , there is even a
special bamboo mat to wrap around you brush after washing to dry it out and
protect it . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#107:2>
The range goes on and on: mortars and pestles to grind your own
ink; fans ready to be painted , complete with tiny stands to hold them firm;
stone block ready to carve into your own &ldquo; chop &rdquo; to stamp the
corner of your painting - termed &ldquo; adding the eye to the dragon &rdquo;
- and the special blades to do the carving . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#108:2>
There is always some new idea to improve the quality and range
of products , &rdquo; Lee says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#109:2>
The family has been sourcing and selling the specialised supplies
since his father , Lee Kwan-cheung , opened the store in 1956 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#110:2>
The younger Lee has worked at the store since 1991 after spending
five years studying are at the Musasino Art University in Tokyo . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#111:2>
Only one sourcing mystery remains: how do you get the hairs our
of a tiger  ' s tail - or a puma  ' s hide , for that matter - and live to make
them into a paintbrush afterwards ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-007#112:2>
Ah , well , Lee explains , they come from old hides and rugs
that survive from the days when it was legal to hunt such exotic creatures .

<ICE-HK:W2B-007#113:2>
With the price at &dollar;7,000 a brush , the supply is expected to
last the Lees into the next generation . </p>
