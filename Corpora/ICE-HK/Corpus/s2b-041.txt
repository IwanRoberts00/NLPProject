<ICE-HK:S2B-041#1:1:A>
Thank you Mr Chairman for your kind words yeah

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#2:1:A>
Ladies and gentlemen <,> I would like to talk on a previous
experience in the use of uh the EPCON system

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#3:1:A>
I hope you  ' ll excuse me uh delivering my <,> lecture in a uh
sitting down yeah <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#4:1:A>
First of all I would like to talk on the current situation in local
garment <,> factories

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#5:1:A>
Sewing operators are <,> exclusively on piece rate system rather
than daily paid <,> operators cut bundle tickets <,> which are input in the
computer by payroll <unc> 1-word </unc> <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#6:1:A>
If the income of a sewing operator is <.> adv </.> adversely
affected <,> due to style change reduced order size or <unc> 1-word
</unc> she is compensated at the discretion of the supervisor <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#7:1:A>
Management staff usually composed of experienced employees promoted
from the sewing floors

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#8:1:A>
Current status of TAP <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#9:1:A>
In Hong Kong there are three factories <,> manufacturing shirts
blouses pants <,> and outer wear with about one thousand five hundred
employees <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#10:1:A>
The head office of the group is in Hong Kong <,> with operations
also in Taiwan Thailand Malaysia and Singapore

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#11:1:A>
There are over twelve thousand employees in the group

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#12:1:A>
The progressive bundle system is used factory manager is in charge
of production assisted by superintendent and PBC department

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#13:1:A>
Having said this yeah actually we are also <,> running some
modulars group yeah in uh Taiwan as well as in uh Thailand <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#14:1:A>
In nineteen eighty four TAP engaged Kurt Salmon Associates to
install industrial engineering techniques using time-based standards

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#15:1:A>
Standard allowed hours and percentage efficiency are now used for
measuring factory performance rather than dozens produced this enables a more
accurate comparison among the factories in in our group

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#16:1:A>
The material utilization department monitors fabric consumption in
each factory

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#17:1:A>
To overcome turnover problem the advanced analytical method
training AMT was used to exercise training of new operators or retraining of
existing operators

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#18:1:A>
Statistical quality control is used <,> to assess product quality
as well as recording the quality performance of each operator <,> so that
action can be taken when necessary

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#19:1:A>
In nineteen eighty four TAP developed apparel manufacture
management information system <,> AMMIS on ticket printing payroll
calculation and issuing management reports <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#20:1:A>
Currently detailed management reports are produced daily as well as
periodically on the performance of each factory as well as each section <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#21:1:A>
Monthly a performance report is compiled so that all the factories
in our group there are ten yeah are rated on the same key indices <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#22:1:A>
<.> Fac </.> company objective of TAP increased productivity
reduced <,> costs quality products good service to our customers and quick
response

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#23:1:A>
TAP Electronic Production Control System

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#24:1:A>
In order to achieve our company objectives it is clear that very
accurate and timely production data are required <,> so that staff can take
corresponding actions

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#25:1:A>
The following are useful information daily production section and
factory summaries bimonthly section summaries WIP status quality status

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#26:1:A>
In nineteen eighty four TAP developed AMMIS which provided daily
factory as well as section summary

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#27:1:A>
To further reduce the time in getting the key information in
production <,> so that remedial action could be taken earlier <,> TAP have a
joint project with HKPC in nineteen eighty seven to develop a real time front
end data capturing device

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#28:1:A>
In nineteen ninety TAP <.> de </.> install the captor system an
alternative to the developed device which turn out to our complete
satisfaction

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#29:1:A>
We have now installed the system in two factories in Hong Kong and
are now in the process of installation in the third factory and also we are
preparing the <,> work for installation in one of our overseas factories

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#30:1:A>
On each work place a work station with both keyboard and optical
reader is installed

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#31:1:A>
Upon completion of a bundle the operator input the data into the
host network via the <.> st </.> work station by scanning the bar code on the
ticket with the optical reader

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#32:1:A>
The host computer will process the data <,> and provide information
on the pay of the operator <,> the quantity completed and the earnings et
cetera

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#33:1:A>
This information can be displayed on the screen of the work station
when required <,> by the operator or the supervisor

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#34:1:A>
All transactions are initially screened on three eight six PC each
of which can handle up to two hundred fifty six work stations

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#35:1:A>
After completion of hundred coupons the batch is sent to the NOVEL
network for updating <,> that will take about ten minutes yeah <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#36:1:A>
This new system enables the supervisors to have immediate access to
the current status of production <,> so that more timely and accurate
measures could be taken <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#37:1:A>
I would like to compare the uh old and the new system <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#38:1:A>
Basically in in the old system the aim is yeah that <,> information
are stored into a are are put into computer and then after ticket printing
<,> this go to the sewing room the operator <,> cut the tickets and these are
input into the computer by the payroll <unc> 1-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#39:1:A>
The computer does all the <,> calculation all the work and generate
different files you know the payment the WIP and costing and also different
reports and this are usually obtained <,> next day you know so there is a
time lag <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#40:1:A>
On using the EPCONS you know instead of the the ordinary ticket
printing we use the bar code yeah instead

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#41:1:A>
The information are <,> take taken up with using the optical reader
and these are processed in the computer and then updated uh in the network

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#42:1:A>
We are getting all the <.> in </.> uh information and data as the
previous in addition there is on-line inquiries this is the most important
difference

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#43:1:A>
So that now all the information are update and action could be
taken <,> straight away on the spot rather that uh wait <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#44:1:A>
Compare with the pilot system the captor has the following
advantages it is more reliable <,> it does not require individual AC  ' s
supply yeah <,> so there are fewer plugs yeah the power being provided by a
central device the operator will be able to obtain more information from the
work station more features can be installed as required due to the
interactive nature of the system

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#45:1:A>
The benefits of using the EPCONS

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#46:1:A>
Traditionally our supervisors carry out balancing by experience <,>
through estimating the WIP in each operation and the output of individual
operators <,> even with the introduction of the AMMIS only data from the
previous day is available

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#47:1:A>
EPCONS can provide the following information <,> one the on and off
standard efficiency of each section as well as that of individual operators

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#48:1:A>
Uh I  ' m show you some of the transparencies but actually will be
<,> will be seen on the computer screen yeah <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#49:1:A>
You got the factory we say yea it is <.> sec </.> it is group
number section three at eleven twenty five and here are the number the
operator numbers the time on standard yeah

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#50:1:A>
It  ' s <.> hun </.> the uh efficiency on standard is one o three
percent <.> th </.> another one one one two <,> okay and the third one thirty
eight these are all on standard efficiencies <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#51:1:A>
If we like to check the factory as a whole then we have the
different section and instead of uh operators we are checking on <,> the
different section we can compare their performance

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#52:1:A>
So <,> at this factory at in the morning you know eleven fourteen
forty nine group one two three four when we have the on standard as well as
off standard <,> you know efficiency

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#53:1:A>
So in this case the superintendent or the factory manager you know
just looking the screen <&> tape finishes on one side </&>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#54:1:A>
WIP status

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#55:1:A>
Either selected six operation of all production orders or all
operations in a PO this provides significant help in line balancing

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#56:1:A>
First of all we can ask we  ' ll ask the computer to list out the all
the POs you know that is being processed <,> you know in the factory

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#57:1:A>
Suppose you know we want to get into detail of one particular PO
let say you know the one underlined you know then <,> this is something that
we  ' ll get you know actually part of it you know because I  ' m showing
operation <,> check point five and six

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#58:1:A>
These uh six checkpoint uh could be adjusted as required you know

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#59:1:A>
Okay let  ' s say for checkpoint number five and for this particular
PO <,> then <,> for the cut quantity is uh twenty four and half dozens
operation number is five one four the current quantity that that is the
output you know of the day until that moment is eleven dozen <,> and uh three
pieces

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#60:1:A>
The total quantity yeah produced is uh twenty-two and half okay <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#61:1:A>
That that is the case yeah and then for checkpoint number six now
we can check it one by one we know you know the output yeah at each at each
uh of the checkpoints <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#62:1:A>
Suppose you know we would like to check you know on certain
operations alone yeah what is the output yeah

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#63:1:A>
So let let say we want to check only for <,> operation five one
four <,> that means uh we are talking about all the POs that has uh <,> gone
through operation five one four <,> these are all the orders

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#64:1:A>
There  ' s a these are the current production for the day we could
say <.> the </.> these are zero and the cumulative are also zero because uh
and the remnant yeah these that means uh <,> haven't done yet this view I
have not been <.> pro </.> uh this uh PO have not been processed yet

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#65:1:A>
And then for this one <,> the output is forty dozens accumulated is
this and the balance yeah is this

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#66:1:A>
These two add up will be equivalent to the cut <,> dozens <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#67:1:A>
Or in some case we are only interested in one particular PO we want
to know <,> yeah the status of this particular PO then we can check all the
operations

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#68:1:A>
For this particular PO these are the operations that we know the
output for the day <,> of this operations the summation and the remnant from
this we know that uh most of the operations yeah on this screen have been
completed except several of these uh here here and here <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#69:1:A>
This is very good uh if we are trying to chase up an order ah we  ' ll
see whether it  ' s complete or not then with one look we say uh <,> you know
we only got uh several operation just a little bit uh remain to be complete
the rest is done <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#70:1:A>
It also offer the real time production quantity and the moving
target to indicate the performance of a section <,> this is also very useful

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#71:1:A>
We can set in you know <,> all the operation that we are interested
these are usually the important operations yeah

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#72:1:A>
Let say a one collar four okay and corresponding this is uh this
number yeah so one one collar four the current status you know at that moment
is uh hundred and five <,> dozens okay

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#73:1:A>
Set top center you know the second one <,> you know is hundred and
eight okay

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#74:1:A>
And it also give us the target the target <,> at that time should
be hundred and one so from this we all we know that we are faster or <,>
slower than the target but of course you know this is not complete by itself
because we need to include the WIP you know in each station so we are in the
process of uh including this <,> into the this uh screen you know very soon
so that we know the output and we also know the WIP then we know exactly what
we should do you know <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#75:1:A>
Trace the operator responsible for a bundle instead of in case of
quality problems yeah this is always a problem you know

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#76:1:A>
In the in in the sewing room you know when we have <,> some problem
with quality <.> nob </.> <.> nobod </.> nobody admits you know then sometime
we ask the operators to in the past you know to <,> sign you know on the
ticket of this you know

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#77:1:A>
But now <,> with the use of the EPCON system unless she doesn't
want to be paid you know otherwise everything is recorded

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#78:1:A>
We can trace back which operator is responsible for certain bundle

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#79:1:A>
Overall efficiency of each section or whole <.> facto </.> factory

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#80:1:A>
Much time is now saved as the supervisors can now read directly
from their VDU it can be displayed in either Chinese or English <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#81:1:A>
If the production management makes good use of this information
substantial savings can be achieved

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#82:1:A>
And I say this is the most important point yeah because the whole
system itself only provide the relevant information <,> whether improvement
can take place or not <,> depends on the management otherwise it  ' s <unc>
2 WORDS </unc> yeah

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#83:1:A>
In our factory we obtains the following benefits in productivity
improvement <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#84:1:A>
What we did was uh after installation of the EPCON system we allow
it the system to be run in the factory for a few days <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#85:1:A>
And we <unc> 2-words </unc> you know so and we were able to
get the the data this represented in the by the red line

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#86:1:A>
After that then we <unc> 1-word </unc> to the management
the factory manager the supervisors and the superintendents how they could
benefit use by using the management uh the informations effectively <unc>
2-words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#87:1:A>
And then after that we again recalled the data yeah and this is the
average of several days as well

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#88:1:A>
This is shown by the blue line

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#89:1:A>
The area cover you know between the red and the blue line are the
gains <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#90:1:A>
And uh actually you know what happened was that in the past we
understand that all the or every factory need some time for warming up as it
can be seen you know

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#91:1:A>
Early in the morning when the operator go back yeah they are still
you know maybe half awake you know maybe they are <,> chatting about some of
the <.> ve </.> events you know they were having yeah uh if it is after a
long weekend you know

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#92:1:A>
And there is no way of measuring <,> the actual status

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#93:1:A>
But after we have shown this information to the management they
know and so then how much we have lost in terms of capacity

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#94:1:A>
They knew what they should do you know they have to go out and do a
immediate follow-up on the operators get them to work early start early

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#95:1:A>
Because we know the biggest loss was in the initial period <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#96:1:A>
And you also almost took two hundred <,> in the two hundred and
sixty minutes you know initially this is half a day before they the factory
reach its <,> final you know efficiency for the day

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#97:1:A>
But in the past you know nobody could tell you know whether whether
we have lost uh this uh this much or not now we could

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#98:1:A>
And so the supervisors they went out they did a very close
follow-up of the operators and immediately you know we knew the difference

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#99:1:A>
And of course we can compare this section by section in this case
we are showing I  ' m showing the whole factory but we can compare the
different section

<ICE-HK:S2B-041#100:1:A>
So the factory manager can can can tell the different supervisor
you are doing better not doing as good </I>
