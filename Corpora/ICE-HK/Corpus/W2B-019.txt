COMMENTARY </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#5:1>
<bold> A </bold> POST-MORTEM of the downfall of Indonesian
president Abdurahman Wahid would probably find him generally a liberal-minded
person with religious tolerance .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#6:1>
He managed during his brief reign to lift many of the restrictions on
Indonesian society imposed during president Suharto  ' s military regime . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#7:1>
Mr Wahid  ' s ascendancy to power two years ago was welcomed by his
people and the international community at large .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#8:1>
All hoped then that it would mark the beginning of democratic
transition and a more stable society . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#9:1>
However , he took office as a politically weak president ,
depending on support from a flimsy and changeable coalition in the People  ' s
Consultative Assembly , whose first objective was to keep Megawati
Sukarnoputri from power and then to seize upon him .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#10:1>
The irony of the whole saga is that Ms. Megawati subsequently turned
out to be the rallying point for the same batch of politicians , who by now
demanded his demise . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#11:1>
Being a weak leader , Mr Wahid should have spent more time
cultivating and consolidating cross-sector support .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#12:1>
Instead he tried to behave as though he were a strong president .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#13:1>
He ignored the fact that previous presidents Suharto and Sukarno were
able to be strong leaders only so long as they enjoyed the unwavering support
of the military . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#14:1>
First , he alienated the military , which is still the No 1
factor to reckon with in Indonesian politics , over East Timor and by
over-reshuffling the military high command . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#15:1>
At the same time he alienated the Jakarta bureaucracy by going
too soft on the regions .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#16:1>
Then he alienated most of the parties by refusing to share power .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#17:1>
When his leadership crumbled , with his orders increasingly
unenforceable , big business and intellectuals started to desert him . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#18:1>
His lesson should be well studied by government leaders in the
region , including Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#19:1>
Although Mr Tung can operate almost " presidentially" , given his
wide-ranging powers and the executive-led tradition , the Basic Law does
allow the legislature to vote down his major legislation or budgets , so as
to trigger a new legislative election and possibly his resignation should the
electorate return an assembly that still refuses to budge . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#20:1>
Despite cries for power and accusations of being sidelined ,
legislators fail to realise that should they become united as a force , they
would have immense bargaining power vis-&agrave;-vis the Chief Executive .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#21:1>
If the parties and independents in the Legislative Council form into
a coalition , they can make or break the government . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#22:1>
What has rendered such confrontation impossible , at least for
the time being , is that parties continue to be divided on ideological lines
and some toe Beijing  ' s political line . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#23:1>
The Central People  ' s Government has an impact on SAR politics
somewhat similar to the military factor in Indonesian politics .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#24:1>
As long as Beijing is happy with Mr Tung , his tenure is secure .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#25:1>
But relying on his constitutional powers or Beijing  ' s backing
can in no way make Mr Tung a strong leader locally .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#26:1>
When he first came to office , he was generally regarded as an honest
and acceptable person without political baggage .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#27:1>
His good links with Beijing , the United States and Taiwan were
hailed as his assets . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#28:1>
However , four years later , his style of government and his
mishandled &ldquo; reforms ' have added many to his list of critics and
doubters , in addition to the pro-democracy camp .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#29:1>
He has alienated the civil service bureaucracy , workers , the middle
classes , and even some businessmen and pro-Beijing leftists who should have
been his staunch supporters . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#30:1>
If Mr Tung  ' s position is essentially at the mercy of Beijing ,
this does not bode well for Hong Kong because he would then become a captured
Chief Executive . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#31:1>
Besides , if he is really keen to promote much-needed reforms for
Hong Kong  ' s good , as Mr Wahid similarly intended to achieve in the early
months of his presidency , he should all the more give utmost priority to
cultivating political support and winning over doubters and even enemies ,
and be willing to work more closely with the legislature and the parties .

<bold> End of the tax myth </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#34:2>
<bold> An overhaul of fiscal policy is needed in these gloomy times

COMMENTARY </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#37:2>
<bold> T </bold> HE Advisory Committee on New Broad-Based Taxes
released its report last week , setting out various options for new taxes ,
including the much talked-about goods and services tax . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#38:2>
So far community and business reaction to the report is quite
negative .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#39:2>
Indeed , a poor economic climate is not conducive to raising taxes or
fees , not to mention introducing a new taxation .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#40:2>
Economists also worry that a tax increase may further dampen an
already stagnant economy as a result of less disposable income being
available to consumers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#41:2>
The politics of taxation is such that at times of economic booms
, people do not generally accept the need for a tax increase and , when the
economy turns bad , they doubt if the society can bear the burden of more
taxes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#42:2>
In the present gloomy days , the government owes the public a
strong case to justify new taxes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#43:2>
It is not good enough to say there is sufficient revenue to pay for
its operating expenses .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#44:2>
An immediate question to ask is whether the government has already
done enough to keep the public sector lean and efficient . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#45:2>
With the bulk of recurrent expenditure &obrack;  some 70 to 80 per cent
among departments &cbrack; taken up by staff salaries and related costs , and the
civil service predominately &obrack;  over 95 per cent &cbrack; on permanent and pensionable
terms , the room for the government to adjust expenditure levels in line with
economic and fiscal performance is rather limited .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#46:2>
The proliferation of layers within the bureaucracy and the rigid
civil service pay structure , which is not subject to regular reviews for
various reasons , have made public expenditure all the more difficult to
contain .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#47:2>
This is an inherent structural problem of public finance . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#48:2>
Besides , the government still holds some &dollar;430 billion in
fiscal reserve , which many have demanded be tapped so as to support more
public services and major infrastructure projects without having to levy more
taxes or to increase fees and charges . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#49:2>
One must , however , realise that Hong Kong  ' s &ldquo; high
reserve , low taxation ' legacy is a result of unique conditions in the past ,
which will not likely repeat .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#50:2>
It is appropriate for the government to use part of the reserve to
cover temporary budget deficits .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#51:2>
That is what the reserve is there for .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#52:2>
But even a comfortable level of fiscal reserve is not going to cope
with any long-term structural deficit . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#53:2>
The case of a structural deficit has yet to be established .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#54:2>
But it is clear that apart from cost rigidities , public finance also
suffers from an unduly income-dependent and narrow base for taxation revenue
, which renders it more vulnerable during an economic slowdown .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#55:2>
At present , the government derives 46 per cent of total revenue from
personal , corporate and property-related taxation , and another 25 per cent
in non-tax income from land sales , properties and investments . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#56:2>
Until the Asian financial crisis burst the economic bubble , the
public had been led to believe that the Hong Kong miracle of low taxation and
reasonably good welfare could be sustained for a long time .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#57:2>
Because of incessant booms in the stock and real-estate markets up to
1997 , generating enormous revenues for the public coffers , the government
was able to grant significant tax relief to most sectors during the final
years of British administration in response to popular demands .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#58:2>
In the process , the tax base had been narrowed further . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#59:2>
It is not too late for both the government and the community at
large to realise that the economic bubble is over and so is the previous
fiscal myth .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#60:2>
The pot-crisis economy of Hong Kong has yet to find ways of
longer-term recovery . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#61:2>
However , the writing on the wall is not encouraging .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#62:2>
The stock and real-estate markets are still at low ebb .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#63:2>
There are signs of industrial hollowing-out and the service sector ,
which now employs the highest proportion of our workforce , is not doing well
either .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#64:2>
Our overall competitiveness is in question , with structural
unemployment on the rise . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#65:2>
Such a macro-economic scenario must be the primary concern for
any major tax-reform strategy .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#66:2>
Unless we are able to maintain the size of the pie , if not enlarge
it , simply cutting corners here and there and increasing taxes and fees will
not ultimately do the magic . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#67:2>
In the short run , more taxation on a population suffering
declining income or indiscriminate spending cuts in essential services might
be counter-productive , and might trigger further social discontent and
unrest . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#68:2>
That is not to say that comprehensive tax reform should be
avoided in the long run .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#69:2>
However , the government has to articulate the reform within the
larger context of economic restructuring and stimulation , and in terms of a
more proactive strategy to rerationalise the revenue and expenditure
structures . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#74:3>
COMMENTARY </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#75:3>
<bold> A </bold> S Hong Kong enters another prolonged period of
economic gloom triggered by a new round of global recession , some are
pointing to the drastic measures recently announced by Singapore Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong , which include the distribution to every citizen of
shares from a New Singapore Shares Scheme , funded by fiscal reserves .
Sensing that the recession will bring about declining incomes and require
major economic restructuring , Mr Goh also called upon Singaporeans to
embrace a new social compact . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#76:3>
Whether the issue of free shares to everybody makes the best
economic sense is , of course , debatable .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#77:3>
However , the Singapore government  ' s gesture underscores a very
important point - that the government cares about its ordinary citizens and
makes efforts to beef up their income in the face of economic uncertainty .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#78:3>
Just a year ago , Mr Goh also announced special supplements to top up
Singaporeans ' central provident fund &obrack;  CPF &cbrack; accounts . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#79:3>
The founding fathers of independent Singapore were originally
influenced by Fabian socialism , though it subsequently converted to
Confucian paternalism .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#80:3>
Public enterprises in the form of statutory boards and
government-linked corporations &obrack;  GLCs &cbrack; form the main engine of
industrialisation and economic growth , accompanied by the active luring of
foreign investment from multinational companies &obrack;  MNCs &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#81:3>
The Singapore miracle is the result of the GLC-MNC &ldquo; two-legged
&rdquo; growth model , rather than local private-sector entrepreneurship .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#82:3>
In building up Singapore Inc , the government actively intervenes
in and dominates the economy , education , housing , health care , employment
and social security .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#83:3>
While citizens are guaranteed a social safety net and decent housing
, they are also forced to save through the CPF , which then provides a cheap
source of funds for public investments .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#84:3>
Since the 1970s , wage levels in both the public and private sectos
have been subject to control under National Wage Council guidelines . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#85:3>
There are extensive public-sector reforms in Singapore , but
these are not premised on civil-service bashing as elsewhere .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#86:3>
Instead they aim at enhancing the bureaucracy  ' s capacity to lead the
nation , anticipate problems and crises and open up a new frontier in the
face of globalisation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#87:3>
Such a state-dominated development strategy may not fit Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#88:3>
Unlike Singapore , we have an active and strong private-sector
economy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#89:3>
But though we do not need Singapore  ' s kind of state paternalism
and economic controls , our government should acquire the same sense of
social leadership and &ldquo; stakeholder society &rdquo; if Hong Kong is to
survive and prosper in the new globalised century . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#90:3>
Only countries that display strong overall capacity to transform
can excel in the global economy .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#91:3>
For too long , the Hong Kong government has held on to the colonial
paradigm of self-sufficiency and minimum intervention .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#92:3>
There has been , of course , some government intervention and
regulation , but these have been mostly short-term policy responses rather
than part of any forward-looking strategic design in which the role of
government was recognised instead of denigrated . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#93:3>
This caretaker mentality has not fundamentally changed since 1997 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#94:3>
Even though Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa likes to make big plans ,
such plans are mostly conceived within either the bureaucracy or inner
business circles .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#95:3>
They lack wider social input and support .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#96:3>
There is also the danger of the government simply taking contingency
steps in multifarious but sometimes contradictory directions in order to
satisfy short-term demands from all kinds of special interests . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#97:3>
Not wanting a &ldquo; bossy &rdquo; state is not the same as not
needing a government that has leadership capacity in society . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#98:3>
It is time to discard the dogmatic state-society dichotomy ,
which places the state and society/economy within a zero-sum relationship .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#99:3>
Inasmuch we need a joined-up government that has good co-ordinating
capacity , we also need a joined-up society in which a strong government
co-exists and links up with industry and other major stakeholders to
facilitate social consensus and to generate social capital for economic
transformation and growth . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#100:3>
In the current economic downturn , there is little that the
government can do in the short run to revive the economy .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#101:3>
But some measures to help the hard-hit to get through the economic
stress are still warranted .

<ICE-HK:W2B-019#102:3>
Long-run solutions lie with structural changes in the economy ,
which would entail pains of adaptation and hence require all the more a
strong social consensus to take them forward . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-019#103:3>
Mr Tung may well take inspiration from Taiwan  ' s recent
economic-development conference and convene a Hong Kong economic summit where
leaders from major sectors and parties congregate to map out strategic
responses . </p>
