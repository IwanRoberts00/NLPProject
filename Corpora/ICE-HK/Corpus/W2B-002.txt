</O>

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#2:1>
<p> <bold> The 81-year-old epitomises the best of Hong Kong  ' s rags to riches
stories .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#3:1>
He was seven years old when the Wall Street crash of 1929 wiped out
his father  ' s successful export business to the United States .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#4:1>
Born in Sind province in India , Harilela moved to Canton with his
family at an early age , and to Hong Kong in 1929 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#5:1>
One of eight children &obrack;  six boys and two girls &cbrack; , he went from hawking
in the streets to heading a family business , which today includes clothing ,
real estate and hotels on three continents .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#6:1>
The self-taught multimillionaire tells Virginia Maher how his father  ' s
personal philosophy , luck in business , good friends and sheer hard work got
him to where he is today and how he has no intention of retiring . </bold>
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#7:1>
<p> " I have always lived by my father Naroomal  ' s simple philosophy .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#8:1>
He said make all the profit you want , but don't be greedy and don't
cheat .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#9:1>
Our mark-up was always 33 per cent , which really translated into 20
per cent profit after our overheads had been taken into account .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#10:1>
My father hated bargaining , and this refusal to haggle and his
honesty were what launched us into the world of business after World War II .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#11:1>
<p> Before all this , we went through a period of extreme poverty in the
early 30s .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#12:1>
My mother came to Hong Kong from Canton in December 1929 with my
older brother George , my younger brother Peter and myself .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#13:1>
My father had had to close down his business both in Canton and here .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#14:1>
He exported antique furniture and jade , and other luxury items ,
mostly to America . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#15:1>
<p> My father , George and I used to do our hawking in Shamshuipo in 1933-34 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#16:1>
We spent many days sitting in the hot sun outside the Shamshuipo
barracks , selling things such as soap and singlets .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#17:1>
One day , an officer took pity on us and suggested we go into the
barracks and sit in the shade .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#18:1>
That was how we became established .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#19:1>
We were the very first allowed into the officers ' mess and from that
small beginning , we grew to become suppliers to the British Army. </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#20:1>
<p> During the war years we sold to the Japanese things such as old sewing
machines , the foot-pedal ones .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#21:1>
We painted and rebuilt the worktables and sold to them as new .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#22:1>
Times were hard under the Japanese .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#23:1>
There was starvation in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#24:1>
My father was beaten half to death for not opening the front door
quickly enough when they came in the middle of the night .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#25:1>
Japanese soldiers lurked in the shadows at dusk and then beat you up
for not kowtowing to them .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#26:1>
I was hit twice on the back of the head with rifle butts .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#27:1>
I didn't bow because I didn't see them , but there was no arguing
with them . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#28:1>
<p> My mother Devi Bai was a very pious woman and no stranger who came to our
door was ever turned away without a cup of tea and a biscuit , even when we
had very little .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#29:1>
We had this small shop at 733 Nathan Road in Mongkok .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#30:1>
Bus drivers and other people always knew they could count on my
mother for kindness .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#31:1>
During the war , every shop in that area was looted , except for this
little place .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#32:1>
After the war , when we went back , we found a red band across the
entrance and when we opened the shop , everything was there .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#33:1>
We were able to keep going by selling the goods , which had remained
untouched throughout the war years. </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#34:1>
<p> The British returned in 1945 and set up their headquarters in Mody Road .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#35:1>
They knew us by name and asked us to become their food suppliers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#36:1>
They provided two lorries and we went to Tai Po to get food supplies .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#37:1>
The army had no money , so for payment they opened their warehouse
and told us to help ourselves .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#38:1>
This was barter before the authorities decided what currency was
going to be used .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#39:1>
We took only two cases of whisky and 20 cartons of Japanese
cigarettes each time .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#40:1>
After three months , when their quartermasters went over the deals
made , they discovered we did not take advantage of them and we were given
contracts to do the laundry for the army and provide them with uniforms .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#41:1>
From that came the contracts for the air force and when the US Army
asked the British Army for suppliers for their stores , we were given the
contracts for Okinawa and Guam .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#42:1>
We are now the largest custom tailors in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#43:1>
Our 900 tailors produce 600 suits daily . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#44:1>
<p> By the late 50s I decided it was time to diversify and began looking at
real estate .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#45:1>
My brothers did not agree , but I thought we had to have something
else , for when the British forces pulled out .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#46:1>
I became a hotelier by accident .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#47:1>
I owned No 30 Nathan Road , and two friends owned 32-34 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#48:1>
They wanted to build a hotel and asked to buy my property .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#49:1>
I refused to sell , but said I wanted one-third equity in their
venture .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#50:1>
As the project went ahead , I bought out one partner and then the
other .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#51:1>
That was 1960 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#52:1>
I was able to do it because the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank
guaranteed me a personal loan of &dollar;7.8 million . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#53:1>
<p> I didn't know anything about the hotel business when I began in 1963 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#54:1>
I was a partner with Chinese friends .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#55:1>
We called ourselves the Golden Group .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#56:1>
It was my Chinese partners who taught me to look out for all the
traders ' tricks .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#57:1>
For example , they made me weigh every delivery and that  ' s how I
learned that people only gave me 90 catties of meat when I was paying for 100
catties .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#58:1>
They showed me how to recognise pork that had been injected with
water to make it heavier . . . all these things , they taught me . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#59:1>
<p> Hotels are most interesting because you meet people from different
countries .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#60:1>
It keeps you young and alive , always alive .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#61:1>
From that first Imperial Hotel , we now have the Golden Mile Holiday
Inn in Hong Kong and hotels in Singapore , Bangkok , Penang , Montreal ,
Sydney and London. </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#62:1>
<p> How did I do it ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#63:1>
I learned a lot , by reading - everything I could lay my hands on ,
and I studied a lot .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#64:1>
I learned most when I was appointed Justice of the Peace in 1963 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#65:1>
I took the chance to visit reform schools and gained insight from the
Tenancy Tribunal .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#66:1>
I went to the New Territories , and did not allow landlords there to
take advantage of their tenants .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#67:1>
I knew what it was like to be one of the common folk and that helped
me . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#68:1>
<p> One of my proudest achievements was when the British government agreed to
listen to my views about young offenders .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#69:1>
I insisted that offences committed under the age of 18 were pranks
and should not be considered part of a record of offences . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#70:1>
<p> I don't believe in this business of ethnicity .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#71:1>
I am not happy when people ask me to give scholarships to students
because they are Indian .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#72:1>
I believe in giving in the place that I made my money .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#73:1>
This is where I made my money and this is where I give the most help .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#74:1>
I am a Hong Kong person .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#75:1>
Hong Kong is my home . &rdquo; </p>

<h> <bold> Eugene Yourieff </bold> </h> <O> TABLE , DIAGRAM ,
GRAPH,ETC </O>

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#77:2>
<p> <bold> When the Japanese attacked Hong Kong in World War II ,
Ukraine-born Eugene Yourieff joined the Volunteers but was wounded and
incarcerated for 44 months at Shamshuipo Camp .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#78:2>
Arriving in Hong Kong from China in 1938 , he expected a much quieter
life , working for the French shipping line Mesagrie Maritimes and the
fledgling Air France .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#79:2>
Yourieff , 88 , tells Virginia Maher how he was the first to spot the
incoming Japanese on December 8 , 1941 . </bold> </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#80:2>
<p> &ldquo; I was a lance bombardier with the 1st Battery , the &obrack;  Hong Kong]
Volunteers stationed at Cape D'Aguilar .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#81:2>
The day war broke out I had the dog  ' s duty - the overnight shift .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#82:2>
As the light came up at dawn , I saw the planes approaching from the
direction of Macau .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#83:2>
I sent for the officers , but by the time they arrived the planes had
disappeared .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#84:2>
We learned later that they had bombed the airport and Shamshuipo .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#85:2>
We also knew the next day that the Japanese had arrived by land .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#86:2>
All our defences were pointed out to sea . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#87:2>
<p> We stayed at our post until we got a call on December 19 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#88:2>
Our instructions were to destroy our big guns , knock out the
lighthouse at Waglan Island &obrack;  off Shek O &cbrack; and then fight our way to Stanley .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#89:2>
We didn't know at the time that the enemy was already on the island .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#90:2>
It was a rude shock . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#91:2>
<p> Our first casualty was Peter Wilson .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#92:2>
He went to Stanley to buy food and disappeared without a trace .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#93:2>
We arrived at Stanley the same day and , at first , we had little to
do .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#94:2>
We watched the funny bombs dropped by the Japanese planes hanging in
the air before coming down at an angle .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#95:2>
Then on Christmas Day we had to support the Middlesex Regiment in the
defence of Stanley .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#96:2>
One of our number was shot between the eyes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#97:2>
There was no blood coming out .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#98:2>
He just fell forward .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#99:2>
That was the moment war came home to us with a thud .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#100:2>
The fighting continued all night .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#101:2>
We were 69 people all together .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#102:2>
By morning only 18 of us were left alive , of whom five , including
myself , were wounded .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#103:2>
The Japanese had come around from behind our position . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#104:2>
<p> We were stuck between the prison and the cemetery in Stanley .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#105:2>
The seriously wounded were finished off by the Japanese .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#106:2>
Their own people were not so lucky .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#107:2>
They threw them , still alive , into the fire .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#108:2>
The Japanese said the city had given up .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#109:2>
We tried calling Command Headquarters and got &ldquo; <foreign>
Moshi moshi </foreign> &ldquo; &obrack;  " Hello , hello" &cbrack; on the line , so we knew
it was true . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#110:2>
<p> I was wounded in the left hand .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#111:2>
I was treated at the British Military Hospital &obrack;  BMH &cbrack; in Bowen Road .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#112:2>
I went from the BMH to Shamshuipo Camp in February and stayed there
until liberation .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#113:2>
At Shamshuipo , we slept on the floor head-to-foot .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#114:2>
There was more space when people started dying .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#115:2>
We were fed two meals a day - lunch and dinner of rice and rice .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#116:2>
When people started escaping we were given only theburnt dregs of
the rice .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#117:2>
I shrank from my normal 164 lbs to 72 lbs &obrack;  from 74.5kg to 32.7kg]
withboots on .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#118:2>
During the day we were sent out in work gangs to fix the roads .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#119:2>
We worked when it was wet and drizzling and there was dysentery in
the camps .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#120:2>
Dysentery killed a lot .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#121:2>
The prisoners didn't fight over food , but all the dogs disappeared
almost overnight .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#122:2>
When I started to go blind from the dysentery , I managed to get
eggs and cod liver oil in return for the gold fillings in my teeth .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#123:2>
I found true friendships in the camps even among the Japanese . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#124:2>
<p> On August 15 , 1945 , I knew something serious had happened .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#125:2>
One of the guards came and said: &ldquo; All finished , all
finished" .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#126:2>
At that moment I felt elation and also fear of the unknown .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#127:2>
I went to see my office .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#128:2>
My boss , a Frenchman , had been beheaded &obrack;  because the Japanese
believed him to be a spy &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#129:2>
The office had been broken into and things scattered , but some
papers had been transferred to a bank .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#130:2>
The Swiss consul told me my home in Tsim Sha Tsui had been ransacked .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#131:2>
I left Hong Kong in 1945 to be demobilised in England .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#132:2>
It took 30 days to get there .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#133:2>
I stopped off in Basra and Cairo on the way . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#134:2>
<p> Although I came from Ukraine , I am Russian , not Ukrainian .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#135:2>
My mother decided to join my uncle in Shandong after my father died .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#136:2>
She took my three brothers , sister and myself to China because my
uncle was the Russian <foreign> charge d'affaires </foreign> there .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#137:2>
We arrived in China in 1924 and I stayed until 1938 , when I came
down to Hong Kong , where my uncle had arranged my job as a passenger
assistant with the French shipping company Mesagrie Maritimes . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#138:2>
<p> My starting pay was &dollar;300 per month and this was increased to
&dollar;350 after three months.On that money you could charter a yacht .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#139:2>
I sent &dollar;50 a month to my mother in China .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#140:2>
I had spacious quarters in Mody Road in Tsim Sha Tsui , and three
servants who were paid a total of &dollar;30 , the same as the rent .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#141:2>
On weekends my friends and I used to rent a car , with petrol and
insurance for &dollar;8 from Harper  ' s Garage , which had outlets on Hong
Kong Island and Kowloon .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#142:2>
This was usually shared between two or three boys .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#143:2>
The girls brought the food .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#144:2>
In Hong Kong then you worked in no air-conditioning and at 11pm ,
everything stopped .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#145:2>
So after 11pm , we all gathered at one of our places until 2am or so .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#146:2>
If we wanted to go sailing , the cost of a boat for a weekend was
&dollar;33 for the boat boy and his son - more than my three servants ' pay
for the month . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#147:2>
<p> I am now the longest serving member of the Yacht Club .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#148:2>
I joined in April 1938 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#149:2>
One or two years after the war , 80 members of the club started the
Water Police .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#150:2>
We didn't like the name , so it was changed to the Marine Police .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#151:2>
In 1952 , I joined a Swiss company dealing mainly in imports of
photographic equipment and pharmaceuticals . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#152:2>
<p> I met Tina Lillian Whitehrow at an engagement party in 1950 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#153:2>
She spent a two-year tour here , working at the US consulate , and
then another year in Lebanon .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#154:2>
She liked Hong Kong and I asked her to come back .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#155:2>
We were married in 1953 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#156:2>
We have two sons .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#157:2>
They attended Peak School and then Island School .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#158:2>
We didn't send them to boarding school because we wanted to bring
them up ourselves .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#159:2>
In 1969 , my younger son , David , and I formed our own export
company .

<ICE-HK:W2B-002#160:2>
My son is now my boss . &rdquo; </p>
