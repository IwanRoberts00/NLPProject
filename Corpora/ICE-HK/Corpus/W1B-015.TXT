Dear Joseph ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#9:2>
I will finish my exam tommorrow !

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#10:2>
It  ' s great !

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#11:2>
I  ' m sure not a hardworking girl but I will try my best to &ldquo;
blow water &ldquo; in the exam <-> tommorrow </-> <+> tomorrow </+> .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#12:2>
But it is in the afternoon and I have to study for one more morning
and afterwards I will have to go to my private tuition .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#13:2>
So , my playing will not start on the next day ! !

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#14:2>
I want to see a lot of movies since there are a lot in the meantime .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-015#15:2>
I think I will not come back after exam so we may not have a
chance to talk in the long holiday .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#16:2>
I have not got a computer at home and we may then only talk after the
long summer holiday .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#17:2>
But if I have a chance to come back I will login then .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#18:2>
Maybe after the holiday or ......

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#19:2>
I don't really know .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#20:2>
But remember to buy me a gift or something in Taiwan , ok ? ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#21:2>
I hope your trip will be a great and unforgettable one .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#22:2>
Take care of yourself in Taiwan .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#23:2>
Do you know any Putonghua ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#24:2>
I know a bit and maybe I can teach you !

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#25:2>
Tell me afterwards how is your trip , OK ? ? </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#26:2>
Best wishes ,

Dear Joseph ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-015#30:3>
Hi , thank you very much for your letter .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#31:3>
Your trip to Taiwan is great and it  ' s great to hear that .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#32:3>
Other than meeting , what have you done in Taiwan ? ? ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#33:3>
Have you travel around in T. ? ? ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-015#34:3>
I have got a summer job in Wanchai and the colleagues there are
great .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#35:3>
They are friendly and I have learned many things . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-015#36:3>
This year I will be majoring in English Studies and this morning
I have my first phonetics lesson &obrack; about the English sounds and
pronunciations &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#37:3>
That  ' s interesting .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#38:3>
And at 4.00pm I will have my first Psy lesson &obrack; Developmental
and Biological Psy &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#39:3>
Arts students seldom take this course because it  ' s a core course for
the students who are majoring on Psy .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#40:3>
I take this because all my courses are &lsquo; too arts &rdquo; , so
I want to take something science .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#41:3>
I hope i like this course . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#42:3>
OK , talk to you later.

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#43:3>
Best wishes ,

Dear Peggy ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-015#47:4>
Originally I have a lesson now but I skip it ! ! ! !

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#48:4>
Because when I am in the last lecture right before this one &obrack;
starting at 2.00pm &cbrack; , I remember that I forget to transfer money from
my savings acc to my current one , so I have to do it asap to avoid any
service charge .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#49:4>
Actually i can do it by phone , but I forget the password for my
phone-banking acc .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#50:4>
So , I have to quickly get this done so as to calm myself down . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-015#51:4>
I will be watching &ldquo; Air Supply &rdquo; this Wednesday ,
with Zoe also .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#52:4>
Originally , the ticket is for Kitty , but she suddenly doesn't want
to go and therefore Irene asks Zoe and Irene tells me this in this morning .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#53:4>
I don't know Zoe will go myself ! ! ! ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-015#54:4>
Letter ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#55:4>
Sure , once I have time and the mood to write you , I will .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#56:4>
Sorry for not doing it the past weekend but I promise it will
eventually go into your hand . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#57:4>
Got to go now ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#58:4>
talk to you later ! ! !

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#59:4>
Love ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#62:5>
Dear Eddie ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-015#63:5>
Sorry for not sending you mails for a long time since I was quite
busy this week and therefore had no time to send you long messages .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#64:5>
i hope you don't mind and please forgive me . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-015#65:5>
How is your life going on ? ? ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#66:5>
Your assignments and tests ? ? ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#67:5>
How are the results ? ? ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#68:5>
You said that last time your car got some problems , right ? ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#69:5>
Is it OK now ? ? ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-015#70:5>
Have you finished your reading week ? ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#71:5>
Mine will be starting on next Monday and till Friday .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#72:5>
But the lecturer of the poli course insists that there is no reading
week next week since he knows by the beginning of the term that reading week
will start in March rather than in Feb .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#73:5>
So , he has worked out the schedule and therefore is not willing to
change .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#74:5>
I have to come back on mon. thur. and friday next week . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#75:5>
OK , i think I have to stop now and hope i can receive your mails <->
sometime </-> <+> some time </+> next week.

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#76:5>
Good luck and bye !

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#77:5>

Dear Ronnie ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-015#80:6>
Thank you very much for the post-card and also the quite long
e-mail message .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#81:6>
Actually , I have sent you one short message last time in your
&ldquo; talk &ldquo; account .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#82:6>
Have you read it yet ? ? ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#83:6>
Because when I tried to finger you out by this a/c , the connection
was refused .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#84:6>
And to avoid losing the message , I decided to send it in your
&ldquo; talk &rdquo; a/c .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#85:6>
So , if you haven't read it , please do so . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-015#86:6>
Sorry for not writing to you for a very long time ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#87:6>
I mean in Chinese .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#88:6>
I have been very busy and will also be very busy in the near future .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#89:6>
My first semester will soon end &obrack; last day on 9th Dec , 94
&cbrack; and so I have three more essays to hand in before the term break .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#90:6>
I hope you don't mind because at least I have sent you &ldquo; a few
words &rdquo; thru e-mail . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-015#91:6>
You said that you want to apply for a job next year and if you
need my help , please don't mind to tell me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#92:6>
I will try my best to help you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#93:6>
There is a lot of information in the career library in HKU and I can
help you if you need anything which your sister can't find out .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#94:6>
OK ? ? ? ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-015#95:6>
Right now , everyone in the third year in HKU &obrack; actually
in HK &cbrack; is busy applying jobs .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#96:6>
I have applied for the Management Trainee of Cathay Pacific and I
will also apply for the MT of John Swire and Sons &obrack; HK &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#97:6>
I know my chance of getting such a good career is very low but I just
want to try applying .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#98:6>
They are big firms and the programme provided is very attractive .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#99:6>
I think if I can't find a job in the business field , I will turn to
be a teacher .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#100:6>
Since I am majoring in English , I think it is better for me to be a
teacher .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#101:6>
I am quite interested in teaching , I think .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#102:6>
So though my friends told me it was very boring to be a teacher
&obrack; actually they are third year students as well but they don't like to
teach and believe that teaching students is a boring job &cbrack; , I still
want to try . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-015#103:6>
Hey , when does your working term end this time ? ? ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#104:6>
Before Christmas or after ? ? ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#105:6>
And when will your school term start next year ? ? ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#106:6>
Please tell me next time when you write to me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#107:6>
We can try to sort out whether we can talk in the future as we have
done last year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-015#108:6>
I really don't have much to say now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#109:6>
If you have time , please write to me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#110:6>
I will probably login next Wednesday or Thursday .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#111:6>
OK , I have to stop now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#112:6>
Enjoy your work ! ! ! </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#113:6>

Dear Ronnie ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#135:8>
How was your Christmas ? ? ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#136:8>
Hey , I would like to ask you to do something for me this time if
this mail is read in time .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#137:8>
I am helping my lecturer Lo to do a project and I need to collect my
messages so as to provide something as HK English .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#138:8>
But , don't worry , I don't need them all but only 2,000 words .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#139:8>
You have said that you have saved my messages , right ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#140:8>
If yes , can you send back some of them to me before 2nd of JAN ,
1995 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#141:8>
I can then print them out and give to my lecturer .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#142:8>
I don't know if you will be reading this message after 3rd Jan .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#143:8>
But I hope as soon as you have read it , please give me a note to
tell me that whether you can help me to send them back or not .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#144:8>
Thank you very much ! ! ! ! ! ! ! </p>

more free .

<ICE-HK:W1B-015#166:9>
<O> two-Chinese-characters </O> last time you came to Canada that
the way you used to call me is just different .
