<h> <bold> Time for change </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#2:1>
US President George W . Bush has not done any favours for the
conflict in the Middle East by saying there can be no negotiated settlement
without a change of Palestinian leadership . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#3:1>
Mr Bush did not name Palestinian President Yasser Arafat , but by
inference he has humiliated him and other members of the Palestinian
Authority .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#4:1>
In Monday  ' s speech , the US President said new leaders would ensure a
provisional state called Palestine in 18 months and autonomy in three years .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#5:1>
Mr Bush was following Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon  ' s lead .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#6:1>
Mr Sharon claims Mr Arafat is not interested in peace and is therefore
irrelevant as a negotiating partner . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#7:1>
It is a position that angers Palestinians and the Muslim world .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#8:1>
Israeli attempts to stop Palestinian suicide bombers by increased
reoccupation and construction of a fence will not end the 20-month intifada
that has claimed 2,000 lives . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#9:1>
Palestinians chose Mr Arafat to be their leader in democratic
elections and is as legitimate a representative as Mr Bush or Mr Sharon .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#10:1>
He has shown his dedication to democracy by promising elections for
later this year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#11:1>
Mr Bush has passed up the opportunity to bring about quick change .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#12:1>
Yet the US is the only mediator with which both the Israelis and
Palestinians can talk . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#13:1>
A void has been created and a new mediator , such as the United
Nations , must quickly intervene .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#14:1>
By appointing a special envoy and putting in place a peacekeeping
force , it can make sure suitable conditions exist for negotiations . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#15:1>
The UN has the resources and , with resolve , it can give
Israelis and Palestinians the best chance for peace . </p>

<h> <bold> Probity in tatters </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#17:2>
&ldquo; Irrational exuberance &rdquo; was the inspired
description the US Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan attached to
his warning about the dangers of the dotcom boom in the late 1990's . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#18:2>
But after the spectacular financial crashes witnessed in the past
seven months which have left corporate America  ' s reputation for probity in
tatters , Mr Greenspan  ' s comment seems even more prescient . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#19:2>
It was clearly not only the tens of millions of small investors
who poured their savings into the dotcom darlings that had lost a grip on
reality , but also the country  ' s boardroom leaders and the guardians of
corporate standards . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#20:2>
Believing their own publicity , this daring new breed of
corporate adventurers placed themselves above the law and caught the
regulators , and at least one accountancy giant , asleep at the wheel . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#21:2>
The Enron crash and the ill wind blowing on the former
high-fliers of the 1990s have left investors shell shocked amid speculation
that there is worse to come .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#22:2>
Their wait ended on Tuesday with the WorldCom disclosures . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#23:2>
However , it is the sheer audacity of the executives ' conduct in
keeping US&dollar;3.9 billion &obrack;  HK&dollar;29.6 billion &cbrack; off the profit and
loss account by transferring it out of operating expenses and classifying it
as capital investment that magnifies the cause for concern . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#24:2>
The excuse from its auditor , the already doomed Andersen group ,
that WorldCom  ' s chief financial officer failed to disclose the transfer , is
breathtaking . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#25:2>
The Enron collapse involved inventive financial engineering which
would have required close scrutiny to discover the scale of it .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#26:2>
However , in WorldCom  ' s case a routine internal audit , accompanied
by a few probing questions , would have prised open the can of worms . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#27:2>
The relative calm yesterday on international markets indicated
that investors had temporarily , at least , halted the display of despair
seen on Wednesday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#28:2>
But it is far too early to say we are out of the mire and that a
bounce back is imminent .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#29:2>
The fallout from the current crashes will drag on for months if not
years , adding to the crisis of confidence that has enveloped international
bourses . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#30:2>
But the more daunting prospect is that other accountancy horror
stories await .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#31:2>
After a decade of rampant bull market conditions it seems unlikely
that all the excesses have been uncovered in a mere seven months .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#32:2>
Alan Greenspan must be suppressing the temptation to say &ldquo; I
told you so &rdquo; . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#33:3>
<h> <bold> Dose of reality </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#34:3>
The Hospital Authority has deftly handled the potentially
explosive issue of cutting the salaries of its 50,000 employees .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#35:3>
Instead of simply asking its staff to accept pay cuts of between 1.58
and 4.42 per cent , in line with those ordered for civil servants , chief
executive Dr Ho Shiu-wai and his senior colleagues have set an example by
slashing their own pay by as much as eight per cent . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#36:3>
Their move should go down well with the rest of the staff ,
especially as under the Employment Ordinance the authority , like any other
employer , can dismiss employees who do not agree to take a pay cut . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#37:3>
Of course , that is not a step the authority would like to take .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#38:3>
No good employer , not least the Government or the authority , wants
to cut its staff  ' s pay unless conditions are really harsh . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#39:3>
HA staff union leaders have expressed regret over the pay cut .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#40:3>
But if they are wise , they should refrain from calling on their
members to take any drastic action to oppose the reduction .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#41:3>
The few civil service unions that are building a war chest to sue the
Government for trying to cut their pay by legislation are getting very little
public sympathy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#42:3>
Instead of opposing the cut , civil servants and other public
sector employees should consider the fact that they enjoy much better job
security than those working for private firms , and their pay will be cut
only by very modest amounts . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#44:4>
Besides the headline-grabbing figures about the Government  ' s
fall in popularity over the past five years , the Hong Kong Transition
Project  ' s survey also has some comforting news .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#45:4>
The worries that Hong Kong people expressed five years ago about the
loss of personal freedoms have diminished , as have fears that were expressed
at the time of the handover over the growth of corruption . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#46:4>
While in June 1997 , only 45 per cent said they were not worried
about personal freedom in the SAR , the figure in April 2002 had risen to 71
per cent .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#47:4>
Fears about the loss of press freedom , free speech , free assembly
and religious freedom have also diminished , with a majority of people saying
these issues were not worries at present . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#48:4>
Confidence in the rule of law , however , has diminished , with
only 42 per cent saying they were not worried about this , compared with 56
per cent in April 2000 , an issue that Tung Chee-hwa would be well advised to
address , given the importance of the rule of law to Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#49:4>
Not surprisingly , the main concerns today are economic .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#50:4>
Unemployment is the major worry , and levels of dissatisfaction are
high over the Government  ' s attempts to solve these economic worries . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#51:4>
Mr Tung  ' s major challenge will be to try to persuade people that
he has the right people and the right policies to restore Hong Kong  ' s
prosperity .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#52:4>
Given Hong Kong  ' s heavy dependence on the rest of the world economy
, the Chief Executive is going to have a difficult time raising his and his
government  ' s popularity . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#53:4>
The survey shows that a majority of those surveyed are
dissatisfied with government performance on two issues - reducing
unemployment and implementing education reforms .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#54:4>
The Government has little prospect of reducing unemployment in the
near term .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#55:4>
But what it can do to reduce public dissatisfaction is to tackle the
area of education reform .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#56:4>
Reducing pollution , also high on the list of public demands , is
another area in which the Government should try to produce tangible results .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#57:4>
Mr Tung  ' s second administration will be judged by its performance in
these core areas . </p>

<h> <bold> Deeds before greed </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#59:5>
One of the sad realities of globalisation is that wealth does not
equate with generosity . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#60:5>
A case in point is the Group of Eight meeting just ended in
Canada .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#61:5>
The world  ' s richest nations have agreed to guarantee their
correspondingly poorest cousins in Africa a mere US&dollar;6 billion &obrack; 
HK&dollar;46.8 billion &cbrack; in aid . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#62:5>
G8 leaders such as Britain  ' s Prime Minister Tony Blair hailed
the package as a " genuine partnership for the renewal of Africa" .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#63:5>
Disappointed aid groups said the conditional pledge was one-sixth of
what was required . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#64:5>
The G8 are the same nations whose international corporations have
become wealthy by using the resources and labour of the developing world .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#65:5>
But it is also true that corporate greed and compassion rarely go
hand-in-hand . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#66:5>
Humanitarian groups have for years been trying with little
success to get American and European pharmaceutical companies to lower the
cost of medication so that hundreds of millions of poverty-stricken people
in Africa and Asia can fight HIV/Aids and malaria .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#67:5>
That some African countries have had their populations decimated by
such diseases has done little to soften hard hearts . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#68:5>
It is an attitude that the governments of developed countries are
in danger of being accused of .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#69:5>
They are effectively standing by as disease , poverty and drought
crush nations . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#70:5>
Some African nations are not faultless .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#71:5>
Corrupt and inept officials have not helped their cause .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#72:5>
Others have spent billions of dollars fighting wars instead of
feeding people . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#73:5>
But with developing nations increasing defence budgets and
decreasing aid , there is little doubt that resolve to bring about a change
is not strong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#74:5>
A wealthy global economy can surely only arise from a healthy
world .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#75:5>
Nations such as those of the G8 must do much more to make such an
ideal possible . </p>

<h> <bold> A question of loyalty </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#77:6>
The view that some SAR officials are still clinging to what may
loosely be referred to as a colonial mentality and not helping the Chief
Executive wholeheartedly has regrettably underlined the remarks of senior
Chinese leaders on Hong Kong in recent years . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#78:6>
This line of thought was clearly behind Vice-Premier Qian Qichen  ' s
comment one week ago that Tung Chee-hwa really had no one to help him when he
took up his task five years ago .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#79:6>
With the exception of Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung Oi-sie ,
&ldquo; all the officials were civil servants who were employed by the
governor" , noted Mr Qian . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#80:6>
Yesterday the same theme was also apparent behind President
Jiang Zemin  ' s call on Hong Kong people to do a better job in adapting
themselves to the new Hong Kong after 1997 and become better masters of Hong
Kong and the motherland . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#81:6>
Civil servants at all ranks , especially ranking officials ,
should &ldquo; conscientiously submit to and support the leadership of the
Chief Executive , work with one heart and strive to achieve fresh successes"
, said Mr Jiang . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#82:6>
Allowing Mr Tung to form his own team to run the SAR was
believed to be a major consideration behind the central Government  ' s
approval of the ministerial system . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#83:6>
Senior civil servants who have laboured to help Mr Tung run the
government and will be sidelined under the ministerial system will see Mr
Jiang and Mr Qian  ' s words as most unfair . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#84:6>
Although the <it> Post </it> has endorsed ministerial
appointments as an inevitable development of Hong Kong  ' s political system ,
we do not think it is right to blame the civil service for the Tung
administration  ' s inadequacies . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#85:6>
Former chief secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang , who warned that
the morale of the civil service was very low , was absolutely right yesterday
in dismissing suggestions that civil servants might have been disloyal . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#86:6>
A Chinese proverb says: whoever understands the times is a great
man . Depending on the context , it can be used to refer positively to those
who seize the moment to make a great contribution , or negatively to those
who advance their careers by bending with the wind .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#87:6>
But history has shown that it is almost impossible to neatly
classify men of the moment under either one of the two categories . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#88:6>
A major premise of the Basic Law is that the civil service will
remain the backbone of the administration after the handover and its key
members at the transfer of sovereignty will stay on to ensure a smooth
transition . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#89:6>
For senior civil servants , deciding how and when to uphold
&ldquo; one country &rdquo; or &ldquo; two systems &rdquo; is a taxing
problem .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#90:6>
None of them should be improperly taken to task for conscientiously
upholding the &ldquo; wrong &rdquo; notion at the &ldquo; wrong &rdquo; time .

<h> <bold> Courting trouble </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#92:7>
The administration of United States President George W. Bush is
making a mockery of its supposed respect for international law through
expressing its disapproval of the International Criminal Court by vetoing a
renewal of the United Nations police force in Bosnia . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#93:7>
That the world  ' s most powerful nation should have resorted to
frustrating a peace mission in order to impose its will on others is a big
shame . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#94:7>
The United States is concerned that its forces on missions
abroad will be vulnerable to politically motivated charges .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#95:7>
But the constitution of the court has provided for elaborate
safeguards , many inserted at the insistence of US officials under former
president Bill Clinton , to prevent frivolous and trumped up charges being
laid against anyone . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#96:7>
A total of 74 countries , including European democracies that
are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and whose forces take
part in many peace-keeping missions around the world , have found the
safeguards adequate . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#97:7>
Americans have to realise that their country will lose the moral
authority to be the world  ' s policeman if they refuse to subject their
nationals to the jurisdiction of a properly constituted court that aims to
deter war crimes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#98:7>
It is thus disturbing that a bill asserting the United States'
rights to use &ldquo; all means necessary &rdquo; to free any Americans
detained in the court  ' s prison is even making its way through Congress .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-010#99:7>
Should the bill become law , the United States will lose all
credibility as a nation that stands for human rights .

<ICE-HK:W2E-010#100:7>
Even though it is not ready to embrace the court , the Bush
administration should at least stop its campaign to undermine it . </p>
