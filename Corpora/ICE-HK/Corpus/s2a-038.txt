<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-038#1:1:A>
Yes uh entertaining

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#2:1:A>
Entertaining because I  ' m <unc> a few words </unc> so the
the <?> sub-title section </?> here is normally should be an initial step
towards computational linguistics computational discourse for me

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#3:1:A>
Uhm okay uhm well uh this is an initial step because I am going to
do uh research in this area for the next few years

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#4:1:A>
And uh I would talk about several points briefly

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#5:1:A>
Uhm the communicative <.> pa </.> paradigm uhm uh if you uh have uh
read the <unc> two-words </unc> uh uhm idea of scientific revolution
in humans that at uhm different eras would have different paradigms that uhm
uh enlightening researchers in their research

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#6:1:A>
Uhm I think right now is time for us to shift to uh discourse
analysis

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#7:1:A>
Uh this is different uh from uh what we  ' ve been doing all the time
in the past uhm namely <?> sentence </?> linguistics

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#8:1:A>
Uhm this is uhm actually very natural because in the past I mean we
could only study things which which are very concrete which are uh below
sentence level say uh phonology phonetics uhm morphology syntax and so on

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#9:1:A>
And uh the more develop you get in the science probably you need to
get more abstract things and you need to consider more things

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#10:1:A>
So uhm uh besides I mean uh people who do sentence linguistics tend
to uhm restrict themselves to the study of uhm syntactic issues and then they
they uh <.> di </.> disregard the use of language uh which I think should uh
we should take uh a functionalist approach to deal with in order to get any
success

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#11:1:A>
Uh since the language is basically used uh for communication I
don't uhm I don't think uh <?> anyone anybody might spend time </?> to talk
about this

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#12:1:A>
So I think if we take uh in this uh perspective that we can have a
better understanding what language is actually <.> actual </.> actually like

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#13:1:A>
And uhm so we uhm want to take uhm a functionalist approach and we
try to talk about uhm language being use as a dynamic process like what  ' s in
our mind and how we can actually use language and what is the output that we
actually say depending on various social variables

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#14:1:A>
Uhm if we study discourse analysis it is very important to talk
about context and co-text

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#15:1:A>
Uh context is used in its broadest sense and uh we talk about
anything uh in the situation in the social context I mean uh background
knowledge of the person and interactings and so on

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#16:1:A>
But co-text is restricted to the uhm the sentences that are use uhm
adjacent to the sentence that you are uttering or you are writing at the
moment

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#17:1:A>
Uhm <,> so according to <?> Heidely </?> uh discourse analysis can
have two levels of achievement

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#18:1:A>
One is to contribute uh to the understanding how and why the text
<?> means or it does </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#19:1:A>
Uh high level of achievement is to relate the text to general
features of the language

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#20:1:A>
Uh he therefores proposes a discourse grammar which is functional
and semantic in its orientation and which provides the basis to relate
language use to a non-linguistic universal of situational and cultural
environment

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#21:1:A>
Okay this embodies a lot of things and uh accordingly we will have
to uh simplify in order to be able to uh finish some research problems

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#22:1:A>
Uhm for myself I have uh <,> uh some objectives I want to achieve

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#23:1:A>
First we want I want to uh simulate the function of the human brain
by the use of computer

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#24:1:A>
And secondly I want to facilitate <?> NLV </?> processing including
information retrieval text analysis and text generation uhm while doing this
kind of research

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#25:1:A>
Uhm uh what I hope to do is to get some uhm restricted texts I mean
the restricted domains some texts in the restricted domain

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#26:1:A>
Uh and then we try to do uhm only written text because uhm the oral
narrative I think are very complicated and have a lot of the regressions and
uh pauses which uh which require phonetic <?> hinge </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#27:1:A>
Uhm and I think I  ' m not able to do that kind of work at all

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#28:1:A>
So I think I like to do some uh formal writing first

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#29:1:A>
And uh uh to facilitate the job I think uh I want to use as minimal
as possible of world knowledge because once you uhm talk about world
knowledge it  ' s very difficult to come up with the good uh representation and
then it would uhm complicates the matter very much

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#30:1:A>
And uh what I want to do is to I want to have a written text

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#31:1:A>
Uh I want to uhm analyse the text using uh clause as its discourse
unit

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#32:1:A>
So every sentence would be <?> discomposed </?> into uh different
clauses uh different clauses

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#33:1:A>
And uh each clause will be headed by a verb or in Chinese case an
adjective will be alright

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#34:1:A>
And uh so the head will be a verb or an adjective in Chinese case

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#35:1:A>
And and then we can come up with uhm <,> uhm a frame for the verb
or adjective

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#36:1:A>
Say for example like uhm if we have the word like is a verb it  ' s
transitive verb so you can have the subject the agent and the the object uh
the patient

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#37:1:A>
And it requires two arguments namely the <.> pa </.> uh the subject
and the patient

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#38:1:A>
I mean the subject and the uh object Uh in semantic sense I mean
that you require an agent and a patient

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#39:1:A>
I think you notice that that the the action of uh liking must take
place at some place and some time and you can assign different uhm attributes
to uhm the arguments there where you can <.> hav </.> have a lot of
quantifiers for the noun phrases and you have a lot of uh adverbials which
modify verb phrases

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#40:1:A>
And so if we suppose uhm a verb like like really talks about
relationship between two and these and then we have a lot of uh additional
information that you may fill or not fill in your conversation then you can
uhm have a representation like this

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#41:1:A>
Uhm this will be easily implemented in a prologued uh programme

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#42:1:A>
<,> So uh what I want to do is I want to analyse text and decompose
it into different clauses

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#43:1:A>
Uh clauses have a well since they are <.> adja </.> adjacent so
they must have some relationship uh between them

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#44:1:A>
And uh I want to uh find out these relationship and build all the
clauses into uh a a very large uh structure that has hierarchy in it

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#45:1:A>
And uh the clauses in this hierarchy will be linked to each other
uhm <,> <.> u </.> using a lot of discourse relations

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#46:1:A>
Say for example uhm there is is a sentence and then you elaborate
on it or you give an example to further illustrate what it is and we have uh
some concessive uh thing that you want to add uh or you have some uhm uhm
analogy that you want to make <unc> one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#47:1:A>
Uh I want to have a test decompose in this way and then clauses
will have inter-relationships

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#48:1:A>
Uh in the case of Chinese we have uhm a very simple discourse
structure according to my superficial observation

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#49:1:A>
Say for example we have uh always the modifiers before the the
modified and this is true at all levels that means it  ' s true in the phonetic
level in the morphological level as well as in the phrasal and clausal levels

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#50:1:A>
So we can make use of that kind of uh uh <.> prin </.> principle to
deal with uh temporal-logical sequence </.> sequencing of the clauses

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#51:1:A>
Uhm the linguistic tools that I employ will be an automatic lexical
functional grammar framework which is uh lexicon-driven versus rule-driven

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#52:1:A>
That mean uhm I rely a lot on the information in the lexicons

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#53:1:A>
So a a word will have a lot of information that will be used in the
parsing and other uh other classes

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#54:1:A>
And uhm so if you have a look of the uh the list

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#55:1:A>
It is a very complicated list and you can have the verb as head so
this uhm <,> oh where  ' s the verb

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#56:1:A>
The verb is the predicate

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#57:1:A>
Okay the predicate buy

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#58:1:A>
It require an agent uh sorry there should an a a patient well which
is missing

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#59:1:A>
<,> Oh sorry uh

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#60:1:A>
Uhm agent and patient there shouldn't be a <?> comma in between
</?> the patient PAT

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#61:1:A>
And uh we have a uhm attribute-value pairs like like this

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#62:1:A>
So the subject of the sentence is uhm a list of uh uh John and uhm
John is the spec and the <unc> two-words </unc> which is which uh
whose value is buy which requires an agent and a patient

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#63:1:A>
Uhm okay so you can have a very complicated list

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#64:1:A>
Uh you can have encode all kinds of information uhm in this kind of
list

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#65:1:A>
Uhm so the processing of this kind uhm this is very uh very
standard we can use the implicational data processing which is uh very easily
implemented in a prologue

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#66:1:A>
Uhm enabling programming and logic

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#67:1:A>
Uhm and of course we have to have discourse models say for example
uhm in our experience in working with an editorials we uh learn that uh
editorial will be <.> compo </.> uh will be compose of uhm uh an event and
then you have a report on the event and <?> you have </?> some argumentation
and you can have the conclusion at the end or some suggestions recommended by
the editors of newspaper

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#68:1:A>
So uhm for each genre of writing you have a certain kind of
discourse model and then you can uhm encoded in uh in various <?> kinds </?>
representation methods say uhm <.> scri </.> scripts uh frames and so on

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#69:1:A>
Uhm <,,> so uh if you look at uhm my my writing uhm for the
representation the dots denote other possible slots that answer question like
how why instrument associated et cetera as suggested by the case grammar

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#70:1:A>
And the attribute <.> dis </.> uh discourse <.> relate </.>
relations will be used to indicate preposition relations with other texts

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#71:1:A>
So we can have uhm information like uh the temporal order or we can
have information like uh uh this clause is actually related to the second
clause or the third clause because it is uhm an explanation of that clause or
whatever

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#72:1:A>
Okay so uhm we have to come up with different kinds of discourse
relation

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#73:1:A>
Uhm I propose this representation because that <?> in the </?>
computers some kind of enhanced functional grammar where one has decides
regular constituent structure and functional structure uhm some discourse uh
information

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#74:1:A>
Uhm and then the the values of these uhm attributes can be linked
to others by some <.> po </.> uh pointers

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#75:1:A>
So you can link up uhm different clauses that are co-referential I
mean that have co-referential values

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#76:1:A>
Uhm well and uhm this pair I try not to use not too many uhm
contextual <?> hinge </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#77:1:A>
Uh so I  ' ll concentrate in the first place the study of uh uh
conjunctions <,> indexicals

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#78:1:A>
So for example even here and there can be indexical

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#79:1:A>
So here may be in this hall in lecture room and there may be in the
restaurant and so on

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#80:1:A>
The the uhm explicit marker for showing that the the relationships
of uh various clauses

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#81:1:A>
Uhm punctuations for example we have well comma versus the semi-
colon

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#82:1:A>
Semi-colon will give you well will tell you that are probably
talking about two things which are uh uh in parallel I mean which are
structurally equally important <unc> one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#83:1:A>
And the comma will probably uh hints that you have some uh temporal
sequence that you may uh uhm want to make use of

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#84:1:A>
And there may be other expressive markers of conjunctive <?> res
</?> relations

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#85:1:A>
For example adjectives <?> adversatives </?> clausal temporal and
so on

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#86:1:A>
So basically I want to study uhm a text with special emphasis on
these uh conjunctions indexicles punctuation marks and so on

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#87:1:A>
And they will give me the enough data to uhm come up with the
largest hierarchical tree for these uh clauses

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#88:1:A>
So besides the constituent structure besides the functional
structure that are proposed by Bresnan I  ' d like to add some discourse
structure which link different clauses together

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#89:1:A>
Well I think I have uh overrun the time now

<ICE-HK:S2A-038#90:1:A>
Well thank you </I>
