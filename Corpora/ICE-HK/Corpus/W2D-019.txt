<bold> Buying a cooker </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#3:1>
<bold> By Vikki Chow </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-019#4:1>
<bold> THERE  ' s MORE TO </bold> buying a cooker than meets the eye .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#5:1>
Whether you  ' re replacing an existing model or starting from scratch ,
the combinations are exhaustive .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#6:1>
According to Miele  ' s senior product manager , Markus Doecke , you can
narrow down the options simply by looking at how you cook . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-019#7:1>
In most Chinese kitchen , gas is preferred over electricity .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#8:1>
It has a uniform flame and precise heat control - excellent for works .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#9:1>
Local gas supplier TGC offers products tailoerd for the local market
from its lifestyle store Towngas Avenue .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#10:1>
The built-in Superbowl Rice Cooker &obrack;  &dollar;3200 &cbrack; churns our
perfectly steamed rice in just 20 minutes and comprises gas burners on either
side to cook stir-fries and clay pot dishes all at once . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-019#11:1>
The electric hob is also starting to come into its own .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#12:1>
High on the style factor , it has a smooth galss top and is
flush-mounted &obrack;  recessed into the work-bench &cbrack; making it effortless to clean .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#13:1>
More importantly , it has built-in safety features - locking systems
to prevent the accidental activation of hobs , auto-heat reduction for spills
or when pots are removed from hobs and glowing hot-surface indicators that
are great for househollds with children . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-019#14:1>
Relatively new to the market is the induction hob .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#15:1>
Built-in coils induce a heat current through a magnetic field in a
pan &obrack;  stainless steel , aluminium or copper pans with smooth-bottomed bases
facilities contact with glass for efficient heating &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#16:1>
Once the pan is removed , heat transfer stops .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#17:1>
It looks like electric models and even offers the same safety
features , controllability and easy maintenance , but it  ' s faster to heat up
, making it more energy and cost-efficient .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#18:1>
The downside is it costs more than electric models . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-019#19:1>
Once you  ' ve chosen your energy source , there are still plenty
of options to consider , so it  ' s a good idea to set a budget - particularly
if you are renovating .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#20:1>
Gas burner have the option of sealed &obrack;  those with removable trays of
easy cleaning &cbrack; or open gas burner , whereas electronic models have the option
of radiant or halogen electric heating elements .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#21:1>
And of course , there are free-standing , built-in , drop-in or
height-adjustable models according to your budget , kitchen are 90cm long and
four burners are 120 long . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-019#22:1>
Chinese cooking is synonymous with greasy fumes , so a range hood
is a must .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#23:1>
They come in stainless steel , glass and aluminium finishes to match
cookers so they don't look out of place , especially those from 10 Zone &obrack; 
whihc specialises in hoods &cbrack; and renowned kitchen appliance brand Gaggenau &obrack; 
tel: 2803 4638 &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-019#24:1>
Bear in mind there is a minimum distance required between the
cooker and the cooker and the hood: 45 centimetres with gas and 65
centimetres with electric .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#25:1>
If you are remodelling your kitchen , you might want to face the TV ,
a window , a wall or dinning table , but this could affect over-head storage
space in the case of a range hood and/ or lower cabinetry in the case of an
oven . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-019#26:1>
Usually the built-in or separate oven &obrack;  single or double wall ,
conventional , convection and microwave ovens &cbrack; can greatly affect the price .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#27:1>
A general rule is a separate cooker and oven costs more than an
all-in-one range since separate gas or electrical plumbing is required .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#28:1>
That said , built-in models can be handy and space saving , but can
prove costly when it comes to repairing or replacing .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#29:1>
Electric and induction cookers will cost more than gas in the
short-term but will be more cost-effective in the long run . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-019#30:1>
If cost isn't a factor then look at splash guards , broilers ,
plate warmers , griddles and grill plates .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#31:1>
European brands such as Miele stock Combisets encompassing removable
, streamlined accessories to slot into the workplace , commonly starting at
&dollar;15,000 for two burners and a wok burner .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#32:1>
You can design your own cooker top - the position of burners , the
type of frame , glass , accessories &obrack;  a streamer that doubles as a grill and
charcoal grill , a deep-fat fryer , a set of scales for the would-be chef or
a sink - or aqua centre &cbrack; so the preparation process is within arm  ' s length .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-019#33:1>
Finally , don't forget to check the warranty and guarantee of
parts .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#34:1>
TGC is one of the most user-friendly places to obtain information on
cookers with branches all over town , plus it offers a six-star service
package: a three-year warranty for space parts , free disposal of old
appliances free installation &obrack;  www.hkcg.com &cbrack; . </p> <O> A photo </O>

<h> <bold> Sixty Feet Under ? </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#37:2>
<bold> Take a scuba safety class and learn to swim with the fishes -
literally , not figuratively. </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#38:2>
<bold> By Joyce Hor-Chung Lau </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-019#39:2>
<bold> Not </bold> to put a damper on your plans to swim with the
turtles in Indonesia or see the lagoons of Bora Bora , but diving is a far
more dangerous activity than some tour operators let on .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#40:2>
In fact , diving accidents happen right here in Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-019#41:2>
Last autumn , a local woman died while scuba diving in Sai Kung ,
and lax diving requirements in Southeast Asia were partially to blame .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#42:2>
It was later revealed that this woman got her diving certificate in
Thailand after only about 10 hours of instruction , compared to the
approximately 30 hours required by most of the internationally recognized
courses taught in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#43:2>
The incident prompted the <bold> Hong Kong Underwater Association
</bold> &obrack;  HKUA &cbrack; to issue a new requirement: that local divers who received
their certificates in other Asian countries , and who were not certified by
international standards , would not be allowed to dive there without being
thoroughly assessed first .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#44:2>
Reports of this fatal accident also cut down on the number of people
who went for overseas diving course , which tend to be cheaper and faster ,
although maybe not as safe . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-019#45:2>
In general , it  ' s good to avoid travel packages that promise
beginners can learn to dive , be certified and hit the deep sea all the
course of a short holiday .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#46:2>
First of all , it  ' s an impossibility to learn to dive well that
quickly .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#47:2>
And secondly , scuba diving is not for everyone . Certain people -
for example asthmatics and those with other pulmonary ailments - should be
warned against deep water diving , since they might not be able to control
their breathing as well as they might need to . </p> <O> A photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-019#48:2>
<bold> Believe it or not , this underwater photo was taken right
in Hong Kong by professional diver Craig Allery , who works with Pro-Dive &obrack; 
HK-USA &cbrack; Ltd. and who has a master  ' s degree in coastal engineering . </bold>
</p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#49:2>
<bold> Back to School </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-019#50:2>
Your bets bet is to seek out a good scuba school in Hong Kong
several months in advance , so that you will have the skills to scuba
correctly before you get on the plane .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#51:2>
When choosing your school. , be sure to look for courses associated
with internationally recognized training agencies like the CMAS &obrack;  the World
Underwater Federation &cbrack; , NAUI &obrack;  National Association of Underwater
Instructors &cbrack; , PADI &obrack;  Professional Association of Diving Instructors , for
technical divers &cbrack; , SSI , BSAC or PDIC .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#52:2>
For details , check out the HKUA website , which also has information
on 32 scuba diving schools and clubs throughout Hong Kong . Here are a few:
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-019#53:2>
The <bold> Hong Kong Institute of Scuba Training </bold> has been
around since 1990 and has trained and certified over 2,000 local divers and
first aiders .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#54:2>
Of particular interest to newcomers are their trial sessions for
those who have never tried scuba diving before .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#55:2>
These include orientation course , a half-day program that allows you
to try pool diving under heavily controlled conditions , as well as trips to
see the coral reef in Sai Kung . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-019#56:2>
Another well-regarded school is <bold> Pro-Dive &obrack;  HK-USA &cbrack; Ltd .
</bold>

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#57:2>
Opened in 1993 by PADI instructor Steve Chan , Pro-Dive offers a full
beginners course for &dollar;4,250 per individual , or &dollar;3,700 per
person for groups of two or more .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#58:2>
As with most professional run course , Pro-Dive students start by
learning about basic techniques and theory through book study and lectures .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#59:2>
Only after that can they head to the pool , and then out to sea ,
usually in Northeastern Sai Kung .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#60:2>
Pro-Dive also has an affiliated company called Pro-Dive Travel Ltd. ,
which organizes travel packages for divers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-019#61:2>
At <bold> Bunn  ' s Divers </bold> , a beginner  ' s open water
diving course costs &dollar;3,972 and includes all equipment rental .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#62:2>
If you pass that , you can opt to take higher-level classes such as
advanced open water diving , underwater photography , underwater videography
, cave diving and even scuba diving rescue .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#63:2>
Meanwhile the <bold> Blue Planet Diving Centre </bold> has a
beginners NAUI diving course for &dollar;2,880 .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#64:2>
It includes four lectures , two swimming pool sessions , two open
water sessions and a NAUI certification card if you pass the course .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#65:2>
For more advanced divers , there  ' s a higher-level course for
&dollar;4,230 .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#66:2>
Finally , <bold> Scubaworld Hong Kong </bold> has diving-related
courses , activities and gear , as well as travel packages and even yachting
options . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#67:2>
<bold> Escaping The Bends &ampersand; Jaws </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-019#68:2>
For the uninitiated , it might seem like the biggest scare for a
diver would be running into a shark .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#69:2>
But , according to the American Elasmobranch Society , there has only
been one recorded shark attack on a diver in Hong Kong since 1820 , as
compared to 66 in Australia , 40 in California , 32 in Bahamas , 19 in Hawaii
and 18 in South Africa .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#70:2>
According to Craig Allery of Pro-Dive , &ldquo; encounters with
dangerous marine life are not really your biggest concern . Most common risks
have to do with the actual behavior of the diver , like panic attacks ,
running out of air , losing your diving buddy or ascending too fast - though
all of these problems should be covered in a good diving course , &rdquo; he
explains .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#71:2>
&ldquo; Even outside of Hong Kong , I wouldn't worry too much ,
because the sharks that a diver will encounter are usually reef sharks ,
which are non-aggressive . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-019#72:2>
Still , there are sharks appearances and attacks every couple of
years off Hong Kong  ' s shores , and at least four local swimmers have died in
shark attacks since 1990 .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#73:2>
In 2001 , nine South Island beaches closed because of two reported
shark sightings . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-019#74:2>
Shark attacks were greatly cut down when the Hong Kong government
installed nylon shark nets at 32 area beaches in 1993 .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#75:2>
But this has little meaning for scuba divers , who are not allowed by
the Leisure and Cultural Services Department to dive within the nets , and
who tend to stay away form popular beaches anyway . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-019#76:2>
If you encounter a shark , it  ' s probably one that has wandered
close to the shore while looking for fish to eat .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#77:2>
Because of this , never dive or swim if you have open cuts or any
bleeding; sharks have an acute sense of smell , and letting blood into the
water is like a sending out a signal &ldquo; eat me . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#78:2>
And if you are beginner diving , forget about diving at night .
Pro-Dive will only take advanced divers out for group night-time expeditions .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#79:2>
Also note that sharks tend to feed between dusk and dawn .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#80:2>
Perhaps the most important thing to remember is that you should never
go diving alone . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-019#81:2>
It  ' s also smart be in tune to the behavior of the marine life
around you; after all , their instincts are better than yours .

<ICE-HK:W2D-019#82:2>
If you are diving and are suddenly surrounded by abnormally large ,
dense pools of fish behaving in an erratic manner and fleeing in one
direction - then maybe you should be , too . </p>
