Well a very good evening

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#2:1:A>
Welcome to the Macau Jockey Club  ' s Taipo racecourse <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#3:1:A>
once again we have sand racing this evening ten races on that
surface and runners are behind the barriers for the second event tonight the
Grenfell Handicap class six gallopers over sixteen hundred metres and of
course we will bring you a replay of race one in around twenty minutes <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#4:1:A>
we have two changes in this event coming up both riding changes
number one Free and Comfort Peter Lau takes over from Victor Chan <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#5:1:A>
Peter Lau rides one Free And Comfort and number two Hunting Win the
apprentice C Chao aboard to claim five pounds <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#6:1:A>
he replaces the indisposed N K Chan <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#7:1:A>
Shouldn't be too far away from the blue light for this second event
our commentators selections Franko Lau likes the way of ah four Full Of
Confident to defeat three three Asian Glory one Free And Comfort and two
Hunting Win <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#8:1:A>
four three one two <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#9:1:A>
Harry Troy also going for the top four but in a different order one
Free And Comfort from four Full Of Confident two Hunting Win and three Asian
Glory as we now get the blue light for the second <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#10:1:A>
and ah interesting both of the owner mates Hunting Win and Full Of
Confident but ah I thought at this mark Hunting Win can finally break through
on the sand tonight he was a lot more settled in the parade ring that what he
ah usually is <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#11:1:A>
has been placed eleven from twenty nine starts on the surface but I
do think with the claim class six sixteen hundred I thought he definitely was
the horse to beat <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#12:1:A>
four Full Of Confident had a tough run but still disappointing last
time but ah once again he  ' s ah jumped out in better fashion and really looks
in ah very good condition this evening ah Full Of Confidence <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#13:1:A>
in fact the two and the four were <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#14:1:A>
I  ' d say were both of the picks in the parade ring and three Asian
Glory I thought ah was the next best two four three <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#15:1:A>
I thought one at value uh one could definitely run into the tierce
in this second event is number twelve My Man <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#16:1:A>
thought he was on the way back with a better run last time with the
light weight a lot of these favourites are carrying one thirty plus <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#17:1:A>
I thought ah at the weights definitely worth throwing in Qs and
tierces number twelve My Man so <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#18:1:A>
two four three and twelve for me <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#19:1:A>
they  ' ve quite a few changes so I  ' ll quickly go through them now
race one number eight Happy Way was ridden by the apprentice Ricky Lei C O
Lei onboard <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#20:1:A>
already given you those two riding changes for the second event <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#21:1:A>
race three is clear of changes in the fourth event the griffin race
number five Supreme Flyer has been wihdrawn no replacement race four number
five <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#22:1:A>
in the fifth event Danzig Hero the New Rider is Bash Siu K S Siu

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#23:1:A>
in the sixth event Andy Tsang rides number eight Siu Lam Lam
replacing M K Chang C P Tsang aboard <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#24:1:A>
in the seventh event we have two withdrawals number six Best
Century is out no replacement there and also in that seventh event number ten
Toys Dragon he  ' s out <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#25:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#26:1:A>
race eight is ah the feature for the ah night class one and two
gallopers over a thousand and fifty metres and no changes at this stage in
that event <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#27:1:A>
also the same case for race night and then the final event race ten
number ten number 10 Suntex Bright is now to be ridden by Andy Tsang <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#28:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#33:1:B>
all clear is up <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#34:1:B>
clashing the favourite number four Full Of Confident <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#35:1:B>
starter holding them just a moment Full Of Confident laying on the
gates in gate four <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#36:1:B>
now he stands up a little more squarely now there still having some
trouble with another runner <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#37:1:B>
and it is in fact Siu Yik <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#38:1:B>
now there  ' re off and running he came out okay Siu Yik in fact he
came out on a line with the leaders My Man a little slow into stride Wings In
Motion and not much speed in the early part is Free And Comfort <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#39:1:B>
very hard ridden as they run to the winning post the first time
Winning Order <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#40:1:B>
and he  ' s going to come out in front chased by Gold Champion Leun
Yat Supreme gets to third as they swing out of the straight Asian Glory in
that bunch followed by Barren King midfield the rail <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#41:1:B>
to his ah ah outside then was Siu Yik followed then by midfield
Hunting Win he strides forward <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#42:1:B>
Full of ah Full Of Confident the favourite he  ' s midfield one away
from the rail as they run by the thousand on the back of him Free And Comfort
followed by Panda Power <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#43:1:B>
My Man is second last and Wings In Motion the tail ender twelve off
the lead <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#44:1:B>
eight hundred metres out High Rolling in front Winning Order lead
leads a length and a half wanting to race a little bit keenly in second spot
is Gold Champion Leun Yat Supreme <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#45:1:B>
now going forward to be prominent very early is Hunting Win
followed then by his owner mate tracking him Full Of Confident he travels
very well <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#46:1:B>
Baron King saves ground the rail <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#47:1:B>
Leun Yat Supreme gives ground followed then by Siu Yik Free And
Comfort starting to get into the race for Peter Lau followed by Asian Glory
Panda Power My Man under plenty of pressure he  ' s second last <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#48:1:B>
and Wings In Motion twenty five off the lead <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#49:1:B>
as flat as a biscuit as they run to the corner Winning Order he  ' s
about to be joined by Gold Champion coming at them deep Full Of Confident on
the back of then in the pink that  ' s Hunting Win followed by Siu Yik and back
over on the inside Baron King Winning Order giving plenty of cheek though as
they run to the two hundred <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#50:1:B>
Winning Order getting into second spot Full of Confident just
battling Siu Yik Baron King coming late Winning Order coming at him in the
centre

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#51:1:B>
then is Baron King with ah Full Of Confident right down the outside
Siu Yik he  ' s going to finish a little bit too strong Baron King diving
through on the centre Siu Yik and Baron King and <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#52:1:B>
Siu Yik takes the prize a neck Baron King Winning Order runs third
from Full Of Confident followed then by Free And Comfort Hunting Win didn't
run on followed by Leun Yat Supreme Panda Power Gold Champion weakened away
with My Man <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#53:1:B>
Asian Glory second last and Wings In Motion last <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#54:1:B>
Number ten is the winner Siu Yik ridden by Christian Reith <,> for
Eric Suen <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#55:1:B>
anyone  ' s race here one fifty out Winning Order diving through was
Baron King in the pink cap <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#56:1:B>
Full Of Confident now again he loomed up <,> as they straightened
and he was there if he was good enough the rider just having a bit of
difficulty wanting to change the stick over he wanted to lay out but he has
been disappointing <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#57:1:B>
and likewise Hunting Win his owner mate late on the scene Free And
Comfort but ah you  ' re singling out Baron King and Siu Yik just going home a
little bit too strong for Baron King and he  ' ll take the prize probably by a
long head <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#58:1:B>
so it  ' ll be ten eight and seven <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#59:1:B>
ten eight and seven after the running of race number two <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#60:1:B>
and the winner number ten Siu Yik <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#61:1:B>
ridden by Christian Reith he was never far off the speed and chimed
in as they cam into the two hundred <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#62:1:B>
Siu Yik a seven year old bay Australian bred gelding by Defecting
Dancer from Dial A Date <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#63:1:B>
and Christian Reith rode for Eric Suen <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#64:1:B>
now number eight <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#65:1:B>
Baron King Francie Naude rode for Wing Leung he finishes second <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#66:1:B>
and number seven winding up in third Winning Order Bash Siu for
Eric Suen officially fourth number four Full of Confident <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#67:1:B>
Andy Tsang for Gary Moore <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#68:1:B>
so it  ' s ten eight seven and four <,> after the running of race
number two <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#69:1:B>
Well Full Of Confident <,> for mine he got a reasonable enough run
I know he was three deep coming to the turn but <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#70:1:B>
again very weak over the final stages Hunting Win got prominent in
the very early part of the race <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#71:1:B>
and he was another fancied runner but he  ' s failed to run on <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#72:1:B>
and Free And Comfort after tacking on <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#73:1:B>
five hundreds metres out he  ' s run on just fairly so <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#74:1:B>
bit of an upset here ten eight seven four <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#75:1:B>
it  ' s one forty five point four so there  ' re well outside the class
record one forty five point four <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#76:1:B>
the class record one forty one point nine held by Wokong Star <,> a
neck by a half and some massive dividends on offer <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-019#77:1:A>
Actually Harry one of the best backed runners late in the race
was Baron King he was supported from a double figure quote down to eight to
one and strong in the quinellas <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#78:1:A>
in fact it was the favourite quinella Baron King and Full Of
Confident <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#79:1:A>
but number ten win Siu Yik at two hundred and twenty nine fifty and
sixty nine dollars <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#80:1:A>
eight Baron King fifty three <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#81:1:A>
seven Winning Order forty one the quinella two thousand two hundred
and fifteen fifty the tierce twenty five thousand three hundred and thirty
four <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#82:1:A>
a neck by a half <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#83:1:A>
<&> Commercial break </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#84:1:A>
Welcome back live to Taipo racecourse

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#85:1:A>
we now have the weighed in sign for race two on ten eight and seven
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#86:1:A>
Siu Yik causing an up upset for trainer Eric Suen and jockey
Christian Reith two hundred and twenty nine fifty and sixty nine dollars <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#87:1:A>
eight Baron King he was well supported but he  ' s paid fifty three
dollars a place number seven Winning Order in third at forty one dollars <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#88:1:A>
the quinella two thousand two hundred and fifteen fifty and the
tierce twenty five thousand three hundred and thirty four dollars <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#89:1:A>
a neck the winning margin a half length separating second and third
a very very slow run time of one forty five point four <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#90:1:A>
Early favourite for the third event seven Super Solartech
surprisingly odds on but here is the head on replay and there was so many
chances at about the two hundred metre mark there  ' re were plenty there
issuing challenges <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#91:1:A>
Full Of Confident in the white cap ah he was there close enough but
just failed to run on when asked as you can see <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#92:1:A>
ah down the outside Siu Yik  ' s making a good fist of it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#93:1:A>
ah Winning Order  ' s fought on pretty well after getting a
reasonable run up near the front and Baron King flying home late but of
course the widest runner winning Siu Yik <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-019#94:1:B>
He got a pretty easy time in front Winning Order no one wanted
to take him on and <,> that  ' s allowed him to show plenty of fight <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#95:1:B>
and the run time not quick but the run time in the first wasn't
quick so the sand not riding that quick tonight <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#96:1:B>
in the early part My Man was a wee bit slow <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-019#97:1:B>
Siu Yik after being a little bit stirry in the gates got out okay
but Winning Order driven to the front as they go by the winning post the
first time for Bash Siu and he lead comfortably from Gold Champion <,> </I>
