To Speaking of Money I  ' m Lorraine Han

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X2:1:Z>
In this half hour we discuss music piracy in many counties copies
of top hits for example are big business

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X3:1:Z>
But how is it affecting the music business as bottom line

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X4:1:Z>
With me in the stereo is Leslie Ching licensing manager of the
Composers  '  and Authors  '  Society of Hong Kong or CASH Mr Patrick Wong who  ' s
the executive secretary of IFPI in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X5:1:Z>
Welcome gentlemen to the stereo thanks for joining me

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X6:1:Z>
<{> <[> Uhm <,> </[> let me ask Leslie first and how serious is the
problem of music piracy here in Hong Kong </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#7:1:A>
<[> Good evening </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#8:1:B>
<[> Thank you </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#9:1:A>
Uh perhaps this is a very broad question

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#10:1:A>
Uhm perhaps let me <?> be </?> give a brief outline of what is <,>
piracy in music

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X11:1:Z>
Sure </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#12:1:A>
Uh it actually in legal term is an infringement of copyright
in the musical works or related matters <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#13:1:A>
Uhm the law granted to music writers and composers a lot of rights
<,> each uh which include say uh reproducing the work in any material form
like compact disc uh cassettes laser disc et cetera

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#14:1:A>
Uh apart from that there are still some more rights uhm which
include broadcasting <,> uh performing in public <,> synchronization into
visual uh materials and also diffusion through cable

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X15:1:Z>
Wow it  ' s a very broad <,> sort of umbrella </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#16:1:A>
Yes

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X17:1:Z>
Right uhm Patrick is it a problem in Hong Kong or Southeast Asia
</X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#18:1:B>
Uhm <,> yes probably and <,> major problem is from CD piracy I
see

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#19:1:B>
Uhm in Hong Kong it  ' s coming to be a <,> serious issue <,> in in
uh <,> in the nearest future

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#20:1:B>
Because you can see that <,> uhm <,> there  ' s a lot of piracy from
from come from Taiwan and Japan <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#21:1:B>
You can see that uh uh <,> some little information about Taiwan is
nine CD plants manufacture CD each each year

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#22:1:B>
They can <?> produces </?> thirty billions uh CD each year but <,>
according to our information is <,> the legitimate <,> CD in Taiwan is only
three million <{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#23:1:B>
This ninety percent of the production are pirate

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#24:1:B>
So we can see that <,> this serious problem in in this region for
the pirate CD we can see it everywhere Malaysia Hong Kong uh Singapore and
Thailand

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#25:1:B>
We can buy <,> pirate CD everywhere

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X26:1:Z>
<[> <?> Gosh </?> </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X27:1:Z>
Uhm tell me is the quality just the same Patrick </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#28:1:B>
The same <[> <{> the same </[> the same as <,> the original

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X29:1:Z>
<[> The same </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X30:1:Z>
God Leslie how do you tell the difference then </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#31:1:A>
So what  ' s surprise

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X32:1:Z>
Oh yes so what  ' s the

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X33:1:Z>
I mean it  ' s must be very much cheaper </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#34:1:A>
Certainly

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X35:1:Z>
Certainly

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X36:1:Z>
How much more fifty percent more Patrick </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#37:1:B>
Around uhm <,> fifty to uh sixty five Hong Kong dollars

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X38:1:Z>
Which is <,,> half the price </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#39:1:B>
Yes <{> <[> almost almost half the price </[>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X40:1:Z>
<[> Of the of the normal </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X41:1:Z>
My goddess

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X42:1:Z>
So if we can't tell the price Leslie what will what will you do
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#43:1:A>
So apart and because uhm what <.> Patr </.> Patrick have cover
is on the record <{1> <[1> piracy </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#44:1:A>
So so I just mention a lot of other rights <{2> <[2> take </[2>
granted to composers and many people are actually <?> infrinting </?>
infringing those rights <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#45:1:A>
Say I  ' ve named the broadcasting of course all the <,> broadcasters
here is <,> very helpful <{3> <[3> and </[3>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X46:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X47:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X48:1:Z>
<[3> Thank </[3> </{3> you

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X49:1:Z>
Metro included </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#50:1:A>
Certainly and <,> uh but <,> uh everywhere uh along the street
in Hong Kong there are a lot of say restaurants <,> boutiques karaoke bars

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#51:1:A>
They are all performing music in public <{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#52:1:A>
They  ' re using our product to make profit

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#53:1:A>
But <,> many of them I must say that <?> han </?> <,> have not got
the uh legal permission

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X54:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X55:1:Z>
When you say they  ' re using your products the boutiques for
example what what do you mean </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#56:1:A>
My product is the performing right in the musical works <{>
<[> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#57:1:A>
So </[> what CASH is doing is administer this right mainly in Hong
Kong

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X58:1:Z>
<[> Oh I see </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X59:1:Z>
I see and uhm is <,> is the industry at all getting together to do
something about this Leslie </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#60:1:A>
Basically now is CASH working on <,> <?> ourself </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#61:1:A>
Because uhm you see there  ' s a lot of composers around the world
and <,> we CASH actually own a large repertoire of works international
repertoire <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#62:1:A>
So everybody here using <,> the music say a popular song or what it
must be it must fall into our control

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#63:1:A>
So we are actually own the pop copyright of those musical works and
everybody who are infringing <{2> <[2> <,> our </[2> right <{3> <[3> <,>
</[3> is CASH right

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#64:1:A>
So what we can do is at the end of the day put them into court

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X65:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X66:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X67:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X68:1:Z>
Uh legislation or get what sort of penalties do they face </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#69:1:A>
Huge damage

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X70:1:Z>
What like what

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X71:1:Z>
<{> <[> A lot of money or </[> uh prison sentence uh what sort of
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#72:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#73:1:A>
Now we are <,> uh mainly instituting civil proceedings <{> <[> so
</[> <,> in most of the case they won't have to go into jails

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X74:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X75:1:Z>
Right just pay a lump <{> <[> sum </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X76:1:Z>
Right what is uhm <,> IFPI doing Patrick anything </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#77:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#78:1:B>
Uh you know IFPI represent a <,> uhm the <,> producers in Hong
Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#79:1:B>
Uh of course the international company <,> so we are now we  ' re
discussing on the <,,> action will be taken in the nearest future <{1> <[1>
<,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#80:1:B>
So I I cannot tell about the details in here

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#81:1:B>
Uhm I just can can tell you about <,> we  ' re we  ' re taking action
because <,> we can foresee that <,> there will be a great harm <,> to the
industry <{2> <[2> in </[2> the nearest future

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X82:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X83:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X84:1:Z>
Do you have the right the legal right to take action of this sort
Leslie </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#85:1:A>
Yes we do <{> <[> sure </[>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X86:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X87:1:Z>
What about the government

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X88:1:Z>
Have you ever asked the government to do something about this </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#89:1:A>
Actually we have been collecting money from the government for
using our products

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#90:1:A>
But uhm <,> the government have helped us a bit on uh mainly from
the Customs and Excise Duty Department

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#91:1:A>
So they have <,> uh do a lot works in the last ten years or so I
think and they almost remove all the piracy plant here in Hong Kong on <,>
cassettes that is very active ten years ago <{> <[> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#92:1:A>
But </[> now what is situation now here I think Patrick is expert
here

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X93:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm but </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X94:1:Z>
Yeah CDs right Patrick you said earlier </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#95:1:B>
Yeah right <,> uhm I think one one major problem to recognize
the kind of CD is that is to to a layman or custom even a custom

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#96:1:B>
We work with custom about how to recognize the pirate CD in Hong
Kong because they <,> now nowadays the pirate is very perfect

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X97:1:Z>
Even the <{> <[> cover right </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#98:1:B>
<[> Even a cover the </[> </{> inner cases <,> very beautiful
printing on on on that

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#99:1:B>
So we <,> we must recognize on the CD <,> itself because every
manufacturer will have the print their <,> code <,> on the ring inner inner
ring of the CD

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#100:1:B>
So we must recognize uh <,> from from that point

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#101:1:B>
So we are we now we work with uh Custom to educate them and to
cooperate them with to recognize them <,> uh to <,> make them easier to to
know what which is CD <{> <[> which </[> is pirate CD I mean

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X102:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X103:1:Z>
But it  ' s still very difficult they would actually have uh <{1>
<[1> physically </[1> open up the <{2> <[2> CD and look at it </[2> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#104:1:B>
<[1> Yes </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#105:1:B>
<[2> Yes if I you know uhm </[2> </{2> that over thousand CD
plants in the world <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#106:1:B>
They they may possible to make pirate CD actually

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X107:1:Z>
Yeah I got to go home and check about this inner ring

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X108:1:Z>
Let  ' s take a short break and invite opinions of callers at three
three three zero four four four

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X109:1:Z>
The number again is three three three zero four four four <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X110:1:Z>
Welcome back to Speaking of Money

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X111:1:Z>
We  ' ve been discussing music piracy here in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X112:1:Z>
With me in the stereo is Mr Leslie Ching licensing manager of
CASH which is the Composers  '  and Authors  '  Society of Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X113:1:Z>
We also have Mr Patrick Wong who  ' s the executive <.> sec </.>
secretary of IFPI Hong Kong which stands for the International Federation of
Phonographic Industry I must get that right gentlemen

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X114:1:Z>
Uhm let me come back and ask uhm Patrick now <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X115:1:Z>
With all the piracy going on how much has it affected the
industries  '  bottom line <,> <{> <[> lost </[> a lot of money </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#116:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#117:1:B>
In the mean time I think uhm <,> the major company in in Hong Kong
our <.> con </.> concern is the six major international company

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#118:1:B>
Because those pirate CDs are major in the international repertoire
<,> but we can foresee this a trend to they will produce some pirate CD on
Cantonese pop

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#119:1:B>
So if <,> if this come true <,> the most of the company in Hong
Kong will be affected

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X120:1:Z>
Uhm do have you got a <,> dollar figure as to how much revenue
you might have been lost as a result of all this piracy </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#121:1:B>
Uhm

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X122:1:Z>
Millions billions </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#123:1:B>
I think it  ' s millions <{> <[> <,> yeah </[>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X124:1:Z>
<[> Millions and </[> </{> may go up to billions if nothing  ' s
<{1> <[1> done right </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X125:1:Z>
Leslie <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> how is a composer or an author
actually uh protected here in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X126:1:Z>
Are there a lot of laws uh protecting him or her </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#127:1:B>
<[1> Sure sure </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#128:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#129:1:A>
Yes there  ' s well defined law the copyright act here enforce

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#130:1:A>
Uh actually it  ' s a copy from <,> the United Kingdom it is called
the copyright act of uh nineteen fifty six something like this <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#131:1:A>
Uhm it is <,> quite well protected but still because some <.>
techno </.> technological changes developments here

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#132:1:A>
Uhm there are some drawbacks in the old version of the law <{> <[>
<,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#133:1:A>
So currently uh there is a law reform commission here <,> doing an
overview of all the law <?> is </?> Hong Kong including the copyright act

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X134:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X135:1:Z>
That right and they if I  ' m not I stand corrected and they <,>
uhm had said earlier that they were actually for <,> the legalizing <,> of
copyright <,> uh infringement for computers <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X136:1:Z>
In other words they legalized that and therefore <,> then it
would eradicate the problem

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X137:1:Z>
Do you see that happening in the music <,> or <?> side </?> of
things </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#138:1:A>
<{> <[> Uhm </[>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X139:1:Z>
<[> Have </[> </{> you heard about <{> <[> this uhm </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#140:1:A>
<[> A little </[> </{> part of that yes

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X141:1:Z>
How do you feel about something like that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#142:1:A>
Uhm what the law reform commission have put forward is a
consultative paper

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#143:1:A>
We have give a lot of feedbacks we support some of their views and
<,> objects some of the some of them as well

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#144:1:A>
Uh say there is one important areas in import parallel imports <,>
<{> <[> so </[>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X145:1:Z>
<[> What </[> </{> do you mean by parallel <{> <[> imports </[>
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#146:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{> <,,> it is importing the goods produce
somewhere

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#147:1:A>
Same products have already been here through a public channel so
there  ' re <,> other people are getting the product <{1> <[1> cheap </[1>
cheaper <,> and import it directly and for sale

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#148:1:A>
This  ' s something like uhm the pirated CD <,> uh made in Taiwan
<{2> <[2> <,> but of course <,> </[2> uhm we object that and we <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#149:1:A>
We think that we should maintain the previous system <,> that
parallel import must be ban

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X150:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X151:1:Z>
<[2> Right and how do you feel about that </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X152:1:Z>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X153:1:Z>
What about you Patrick

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X154:1:Z>
How do you feel about about <,> uh the possible legalizing of <,>
of something like pirated music <,> software </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#155:1:B>
Of course the the producers uh object to <,> the release
control on on the pirate import because

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#156:1:B>
The pirate import now nowadays in in Hong Kong <,> uh uh affect
<,> affecting our industry <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#157:1:B>
Because <,> we we cannot <,> no control on that will will will be
<,> be mean a lot a bigger loss of <.> mon </.> money

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X158:1:Z>
Right </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#159:1:B>
Uhm <,> the government to take the computer software as
example is not very good example I think

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#160:1:B>
Because computer is completely different product <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#161:1:B>
<.> Mus </.> music <.> indu </.> industry <,> the product CD is
complete <,> when you have pirate imports and original you buy in Hong <{>
<[> Kong is </[> completely <,> the same

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X162:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X163:1:Z>
Right so Patrick what can companies or producers do like <,> EMI
or whatever what other Warner Brothers or whatever

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X164:1:Z>
What are what can they do actually to stop this or can they do
anything </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#165:1:B>
We can only <,> we can only stop those pirate <?> in </?>
which is they have <,> the licensee in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#166:1:B>
I mean the exclusive license they can sell they can import and <,>
and distributing in Hong Kong <{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#167:1:B>
But <,> this quite number of the parallel import in Hong Kong now
is they haven't got any licensee

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#168:1:B>
So we cannot stop that we can only <,> try to do <,> to stop to uh
those pirate imports which is we have licensee in Hong Kong

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X169:1:Z>

Right let  ' s take a caller here <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X179:1:Z>
Good evening </X>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X180:1:Z>
<{> <[> Hello </[> </X>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X181:1:Z>
<[> Hello </[> </{> Jack </X>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X182:1:Z>
Hello </X>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X183:1:Z>
Hello your question </X>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X184:1:Z>
Uh yes I  ' d like to put forward a proposition

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X185:1:Z>
Uh we  ' re talking here about record companies losing money as a
consequence piracy

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X186:1:Z>
Is it not equally fair to say that record company greed is what
leads to piracy in the first place

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X187:1:Z>
If pirates are able to produce CDs at half the price that the
record company charges then it  ' s the record company  ' s fault of charging so
much

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X188:1:Z>
Why can they not produce <,> the CD themselves at that price and
uh put the pirate out of business </X>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X189:1:Z>
In other words <,> drop your price tag right <{> <[> Jack </[>
</X>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X190:1:Z>
<[> <?> Exact </?> </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X191:1:Z>
<{> <[> Exactly </[> </X>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X192:1:Z>
<[> Patrick </[> </{> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#193:1:B>
Uhm Jack I think uh the record company we and we invest the
money to <,,> to make a to make a artist the talents and they they invest
money to stereo and producers and a lot of things they must do

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#194:1:B>
And uh promotions they we have <,> pay money to them <{> <[> so
this </[>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X195:1:Z>
<[> I I thought I see </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X196:1:Z>
I mean that that in itself is a fair point and that may <,> that
may be applicable to <,> uh new record and artist that are just coming

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X197:1:Z>
But uh the other side to that coin is that there are thousand and
thousand the record from artists

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X198:1:Z>
Uhm <,> let  ' s take the Beatles for example <{1> <[1> whose
record </[1> have paid for themselves hundred of times over whose production
and cost have been subsidized hundred and thousand of time over

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X199:1:Z>
And therefore there is no <.> ne </.> necessary contribution to
fixed cost being taken from the sales of those new new records

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X200:1:Z>
And yet they  ' re still being produced still being sold <,> at the
same price <,> as those being sold for new artists <{2> <[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X201:1:Z>
Is that fair </[2> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#202:1:B>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#203:1:B>
<[2> But if you if </[2> </{2> you compare with the prices <,> uh
<,> uh <,> nowadays with the past five years we can see that the price are
going low <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#204:1:B>
But we can we can't <,> we can't do that is the England or or or
UK I mean the UK or USA <,> they haven't <?> lowers </?> their price <,> we
can't we can't do that first

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X205:1:Z>
Right let  ' s ask Leslie to join in conversation </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#206:1:A>
Yes perhaps we have miss one uh very important point is about
the theme main theme of tonight is piracy in music

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#207:1:A>
Uh it is all evolved from copyright matters

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#208:1:A>
Say for selling of a record there <,> uh percentage of the money
uh received is going to the <,> uh record companies of course

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#209:1:A>
Another percentage to the artist another one to the music <?> cop
</?> uh writers

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#210:1:A>
And for the pirated copies actually what they are doing is doing
using a CD to copy <,> hundred or thousands of copies without paying any
dollar of royalties of copyright loyal royalties

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#211:1:A>
<{> <[> So all the </[> all the music writers artists are not
giving their fair share

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X212:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#213:1:B>
<[> Yes that  ' s right </[> </{>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X214:1:Z>
That well that that that that may well be a case in point

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X215:1:Z>
But nonetheless given the fact that uhm it  ' s a fairly well known
at the moment that CDs can be produced for a fraction of the cost at which
they  ' re sold

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X216:1:Z>
I think uh <,> record companies will continue to have this
problem with piracy because the the public at large are not willing to accept
the company are suffering

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X217:1:Z>
The public at large are still perceive record companies are
making far too many profits at the expense of the the record buying public
<{> <[> and </[> given the opportunity to buy a pirated CD they  ' ll probably
continue to do so </X>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X218:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X219:1:Z>
Right uh before you go Jack I  ' d like to ask you a question

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X220:1:Z>
Would you by any chance buy a pirated CD </X>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X221:1:Z>
Uh yes </X>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X222:1:Z>
Why </X>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X223:1:Z>
Uh well as I say because I think record companies <,> are guilty
of overcharging by to a gross extent <{> <[> and while </[> I agree that one
should pay perhaps more for new artist

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X224:1:Z>
One should pay royalties to the artist whose songs are being
played

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X225:1:Z>
Record companies are are by far and away uhm <,> the biggest
culprits <?> in this and </?> they put themselves in the position where the
public has no sympathy for them </X>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X226:1:Z>
<[> I see </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X227:1:Z>
I see well thank you very much for your call <{> <[> Jack </[>
<.> preciate </.> it thank you

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X228:1:Z>
Let  ' s take a short break here and invite other callers at three
three three zero four four four

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X229:1:Z>
The number again is three three three zero four four four

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X230:1:Z>
Welcome back to Speaking of Money I  ' m Lorraine Han

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X231:1:Z>
We  ' ve been talking about music piracy here in Hong Kong and with
me in the stereo is Mr Leslie Ching licensing manager with CASH which stands
for the Composers  '  and Authors  '  Society of Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X232:1:Z>
We also have in the stereo Patrick Wong who  ' s the executive
secretary of IFPI Hong Kong which is the International Federation of
Phonographic Industry

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X233:1:Z>
Gentlemen let me come back and and ask you are there any uhm
organizations or people here in Hong Kong actually successfully prosecuted
Leslie </X>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X234:1:Z>
<[> Thank you </[> </{> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#235:1:A>
Uh on what I  ' m working on on the performing side <,> uh lot
of say restaurants boutiques and karaoke bars have been prosecuted <{> <[>
say </[> in <,> in in past years

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X236:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X237:1:Z>
So it  ' s only been in the past few years that actual action has
been taken </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#238:1:A>
No action has been taken all the time actually uh in every
year we take about hundred cases to court

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X239:1:Z>
Wow </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#240:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X241:1:Z>
It  ' s a lot

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X242:1:Z>
Uhm so do you believe that legislation is the answer <,> <{> <[>
to the problem </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#243:1:A>
<[> Not yet </[> </{> not yet

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#244:1:A>
There are lot of loop loop <?> hole </?> over there

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X245:1:Z>
Yes like lowering your price as we have heard from a caller Jack
earlier yes

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X246:1:Z>
Uhm tell me Patrick if a song is an old one <,> for example like
let say Mozart Beethoven

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X247:1:Z>
It  ' s been run it  ' s still on the on the shelves of a number of
of uhm <,> uhm shops

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X248:1:Z>
Are they still protected </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#249:1:B>
Uh according to the copyright act <,> uhm <,> the sound
recording is protected <,> when <,> after after the release date fifty years

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#250:1:B>
After after the that that period <,> the songs uh will be come to
a public domain

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#251:1:B>
Everybody can use it <{> <[> but they </[> but you still to pay a
<,> certain kind of royalty <,> to the companies which uh produce it

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X252:1:Z>
<[> I see </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X253:1:Z>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X254:1:Z>
Leslie what about music videos

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X255:1:Z>
Do they fall victim to piracy as well <,> or Patrick should I say
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X256:1:Z>
Either one of you I don't care </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#257:1:B>
Yeah I think music video <,> will <,> they have pirates but
<,> not not much than CDs because <.> mus </.> music video is <,> rather
complicated <{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#258:1:B>
They cost a lot <,> and <,> CD I think is most convenient way to
to do the pirates because you just dub dubs to a DAT <,> DAT machine and go
to manufacturer the factories and copy copy duplicating many many copies

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X259:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X260:1:Z>
Uh well I would have thought just duplicating uh music video on
VHS would have been same sort of thing <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X261:1:Z>
Not really </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#262:1:B>
Not really

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#263:1:A>
<{1> <[1> So it </[1> touched on a very interesting topic
that it heated up a few months ago

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#264:1:A>
It  ' s about the blank tape levy <{2> <[2> if if </[2> you can <.>
re </.> still remember <{3> <[3> <,> it </[3> is about home taping

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#265:1:A>
So everybody get a CD or rent a CD and from shop and do a dubbing
at home and <.> rec </.> <?> most </?> choose all the most favourite songs

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#266:1:A>
This is all the home taping is illegal at this moment

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X267:1:Z>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X268:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X269:1:Z>
<[3> Yes </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X270:1:Z>
Right you mean the combination of various hits </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#271:1:A>
Uh no it  ' s the act of coping <{1> <[1> it  ' s illegal

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#272:1:A>
Of </[1> course many would say that it is only for private <?> use
</?> private use put it into <,> car <?> hifi </?> or whatever <{2> <[2> but
</[2> still it is illegal <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#273:1:A>
So the law reform commission just follow international trend
proposed a blank tape levy on <,> on the cassette cassette tapes

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X274:1:Z>
<[1> Oh I see right </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X275:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X276:1:Z>
<[3> Oh </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X277:1:Z>
Uhm and when is this levy come into effect </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#278:1:A>
Uh I just mention it  ' s still in consultative period and it  ' s
all up to the government to decide whether it will be legislated or not

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X279:1:Z>
Uhm how much of a problem Patrick is piracy of in China </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#280:1:B>
Very serious

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X281:1:Z>
Very serious uh you say with a smile though </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#282:1:B>
Yeah but <,> <.> Chi Chi </.> in in China the pirate <?>
response </?> major on the tax

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X283:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#284:1:B>
Uh because CDs not very popular in in China the penetration
of the CD players is not very <,> very good uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#285:1:B>
Uhm but it  ' s still <,> very serious problem

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#286:1:B>
Be uh especially <,> a southern offshore area

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X287:1:Z>
Like Shenzhen that area </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#288:1:B>
Yeah right <{> <[> Shenzhen <unc> one-word </unc> Fu
<?> Fukien </?> </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#289:1:A>
<[> See one one interesting point <unc> one-word
</unc> </[> </{>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X290:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#291:1:B>
Areas where uh you can buy everywhere

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X292:1:Z>
Right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#293:1:A>
It  ' s one interesting point is the copyright law in China
just came up <,> this year <{> <[> the </[> first ever one

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X294:1:Z>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X295:1:Z>
A few months ago <{1> <[1> actually yes </[1> <{2> <[2> and </[2>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#296:1:A>
<[1> Yes July </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#297:1:B>
<[2> I think </[2> </{2> I think the may major major major
issues on <,> who who will be executed <,> <{1> <[1> where the </[1> execute
the <,> the law <{2> <[2> to </[2> <,> to to the area

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X298:1:Z>
<[1> Executed </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X299:1:Z>
<[2> Right </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X300:1:Z>

should aware of and uh looking at uhm at uh pirated <,> soft music </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#302:1:B>
Uh I my only advice is uh when you walk walk around walk
along the Mong Kok area just just be aware of the pirated CD

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X303:1:Z>
Close your eyes and don't buy </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#304:1:B>
Yes of course

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X305:1:Z>
Leslie </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#306:1:A>
Just one word is uh <.> apprec </.> uh to to appreciate the
work of the composers

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X307:1:Z>
Right yes they do do a lot of hard work

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X308:1:Z>

<{3> <[3> for coming </[3> in

and Authors  '  Society here in Hong Kong and Mr Patrick Wong who  ' s executive
secretary with the International Federation of Phonographic Industry I  ' ve
got that right

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X310:1:Z>
And uh we we  ' re Speaking of Money tonight

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X311:1:Z>
We also like to thank our caller Jack who <,> share a lot of <?>
light </?> to the industry we thank him

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#X312:1:Z>
And we take a break now for the news at the top of the hour do
stay with us because conversations follow next </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#313:1:A>
<[1> Yes </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#314:1:A>
<[2> Thank you </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#315:1:B>
<[3> Thank you </[3> </{3> </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#316:2:A>
I have some problem with that

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#317:2:A>
I think he  ' s proposing to finance <?> infrastructural </?>
development with the issue of three year bonds

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#318:2:A>
Uh now I I I can't see how they can be done mean you you got short
term borrowing <,> to deal with a long term <,> development uh there  ' s going
to be mismatching <{> <[> somewhere </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#319:2:B>
<[> But I </[> </{> guess in the end there will be long term
bonds <{1> <[1> issues

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#320:2:B>
And </[1> I  ' m in favour of using <,> uh government bonds to
finance long term projects for <.> vari </.> various reasons <{2> <[2> as
</[2>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-029#321:2:A>
<[1> Right okay </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-029#322:2:A>
<[2> But </[2> </{2> we can't because if you <unc> one-word
</unc> nineteen ninety seven then of course the PRC government  ' s consent
would have to be given
