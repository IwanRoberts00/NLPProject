<bold> TAXPAYERS RESPONDED </bold> with an immediate outcry to the
recent report of the Advisory Committee on New Broad-based Taxes setting out
13 options for broadening Hong Kong  ' s tax base , either by raising existing
taxes or imposing new ones .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#5:1>
The uproar prompted Financial Secretary Antony Leung Kam-chung to
clarify quickly that no new taxes would be imposed while the economy was weak .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#6:1>
Then , in an attempt to temper the impact of an Economist
Intelligence Unit report indicating Hong Kong  ' s attractiveness as a business
environment would diminish over the next five years , Mr Leung announced that
Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa  ' s October Policy Address would include some
&ldquo; little gestures to spur the economy &rdquo; That generated intense
speculation about what forms the Government  ' s potential generosity might
take . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#7:1>
So the Government faces a difficult choice: raise more money or
give out more money .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#8:1>
On one hand , it might be facing a structural financial crisis , and
it is definitely facing an eroding tax base .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#9:1>
Some estimate that as much as 60 per cent of government income comes
directly or indirectly from the property sector , which is on a downward
trend .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#10:1>
The Government must seek new ways to finance its ever-increasing
expenditure . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#11:1>
On the other hand , raising taxes has never been popular -
especially when the Government is sitting on &dollar;400 billion in fiscal
reserves .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#12:1>
When times are as hard as they are now , people expect the Government
to use these reserves for something positive , instead of just sitting on
them in preparation for an ostensibly inevitable budget deficit . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#13:1>
The people of Hong Kong - especially members of the Legislative
Council , which has the power to veto the budget and tax measures - will not
let the Government raise more revenue unless it commits firmly to a painful
round of &ldquo; fat-trimming &rdquo; &obrack;  to quote the Chief Secretary for
Administration , Donald Tsang Yam-kuen &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#14:1>
Although the world has been led to believe the Government is a
trim and efficient operation , civil servants and other people paid out of
the public purse - such as hospital workers , teachers , social workers , etc .
- make up roughly five per cent of the population , about the same percentage
as on the mainland five years ago .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#15:1>
The central Government realised its ranks were too hefty and has
since cut the portion of the population it employs by half . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#16:1>
In contrast , the SAR Government , despite being under tremendous
pressure from the public , has made only a feeble commitment to cut its wage
bill by five per cent over three years . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#17:1>
This exercise is slated to involve drastic cuts among the rank-
and-file but few , if any , cuts among the highly paid Administrative
Officers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#18:1>
Worse , civil servants in the upper band were recently awarded a 4.99
per cent salary increase - with various adjustments , some received increases
as high as nine per cent .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#19:1>
Meanwhile , their colleagues in the middle and lower bands got rises
of 2.38 per cent . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#20:1>
Before the handover , I recommended drastic cuts in the civil
service , and I am still unreservedly in favour of doing this .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#21:1>
As Mr Leung has often noted , civil-service reform involves a &ldquo;
paradigm shift" , not just attrition .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#22:1>
Staff cuts must be made fairly , tactfully and at the right time .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#23:1>
To be fair , although we can grouse all day about our
Administrative Officers , we cannot fairly call them lazy .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#24:1>
Especially since the handover , middle-ranking officials have been
putting in 12-hour days .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#25:1>
They are working themselves into the ground , sacrificing family life
and , in some cases , even marriage . But what are the results ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#26:1>
Green groups from Hong Kong recently organised a visit to the
Pearl River Delta and came back very impressed with what they saw .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#27:1>
The number of environmental-protection officers in Guangdong , which
has a population 10 times greater than Hong Kong , was more or less the same
as ours .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#28:1>
Obviously , our bureaucrats are not doing the right thing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#29:1>
Right now , our most important problem is unemployment , and the
key to this problem is competitiveness .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#30:1>
Over time , free trade causes prices to equalise between trading
countries - with this process relentlessly at work , Hong Kong  ' s high-priced
labour is being squeezed out of the regional and global markets . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#31:1>
But for the four years since the handover , the SAR Government
has been stuck in an old paradigm - focusing on the property market .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#32:1>
Officials initially attempted to cool the market , then sought to
ease it into a soft landing , and now they are trying to support it
artificially .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#33:1>
As a result , the Government has been hijacked by the property
tycoons . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#34:1>
The property market will crash .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#35:1>
Fighting market forces can only make things worse .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#36:1>
Property prices last year were on a par with 1995; prices this year
are on a par with 1994 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#37:1>
At this rate , prices next year will be on a par with 1993 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#38:1>
Many people are holding negatively valued assets - that is , their
property is now worth less than they paid for it .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#39:1>
A banking crisis will come in due course , although the Government is
trying extra hard to avoid it . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#40:1>
If the Government shifts its focus to employment and
competitiveness , a lot of things will have to be done differently .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#41:1>
For example , funding for job training and for fostering small and
medium-sized enterprises &obrack;  SMEs &cbrack; should have a much higher priority .
Ironically , the Government recently launched another SME-assistance scheme
but with much less funding .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#42:1>
I am a beneficiary of the previous SME-loan programme , and one of
the few to have repaid my loan .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#43:1>
I can tell you the officials who designed this scheme did not
understand the needs of SMEs or the mentality of bankers , and the whole
thing was an expensive farce . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#44:1>
Without jobs in the market , even the best government retraining
programme will be a waste of money , at least in the short term .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#45:1>
And the hype will do little but create even more frustration among
the unemployed .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#46:1>
By creating expectations without sufficient means to satisfy those
expectations , the Government is flirting with trouble .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#47:1>
Sponsoring SMEs is better than paying out public money or subsidising
mortgages .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#48:1>
It encourages entrepreneurship , creativity and self-reliance .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#49:1>
Ultimately , however , we have to improve our competitiveness . </p>

Associate degrees are booming - but are they all they promise to be ,
asks <it> Linda Yeung </it> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#52:2>
<bold> Sub-degree studies: the straitjacket effect </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#53:2>
A year ago , John Fu Keung was like many Form Seven graduates ,
unsure about what to do after failing to get into university . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#54:2>
Eventually he enrolled in the community college launched by the
University of Hong Kong  ' s School of Professional and Continuing Education &obrack; 
SPACE &cbrack; , which offers associate degrees . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#55:2>
In the past year other universities have decided to offer similar
programmes preparing students to move on to full degree studies .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#56:2>
The number of associate degree &obrack;  AD &cbrack; places to be offered in
September will rise to 5,000 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#57:2>
The Open University of Hong Kong and Lingnan University are among
the institutions that have joined the fray , bringing to 11 the total number
of AD course providers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#58:2>
Annual fees range from &dollar;35,000 up to &dollar;50,000 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#59:2>
But the boom in such courses has not eased John  ' s worries .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#60:2>
Apart from the uncertainty of being accepted by a university when he
graduates next year , he is also wondering whether he is getting value for
money .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#61:2>
The annual tuition fee of &dollar;36,000 he has paid is only a few
hundred dollars less than regular university fees . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#62:2>
Unlike &ldquo; regular &rdquo; University of Hong Kong students ,
who enjoy campus life and culture at the historic Pokfulam site , John has
classes at SPACE  ' s learning centre above the Admiralty MTR station .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#63:2>
There he enjoys few of the benefits of student life , with the SPACE
facility bereft of students ' clubs and societies . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#64:2>
&ldquo; The college is more like a tutorial school to me .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#65:2>
But we are encouraged to express our views in class and the learning
atmosphere is good , &rdquo; said John , who is studying for an AD in
business administration .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#66:2>
This was not his first choice , but the narrow range of subjects gave
him few options .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#67:2>
&ldquo; I wanted to study pure science but there are few science
subjects available . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#68:2>
To him , even the Institute of Vocational Education , which
offers diplomas for technical courses , offers better value for money .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#69:2>
&ldquo; Their graduates may have better job prospects due to their
substantial practical training .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#70:2>
Also , I am not sure if I can move on to a university later when I
graduate . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#71:2>
The three full-time AD programmes to be introduced by the Open
University , for example , centre on either business administration or
information technology .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#72:2>
At the Caritas Francis Hsu College , the AD programmes linked to
studies at Australian , American or British universities are in accounting ,
translation , computing and company administration . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#73:2>
Class venues for similar courses also vary , with some , such as
those run by Baptist University  ' s College of International Education , being
held on campus , and others tucked away in commercial buildings . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#74:2>
The reason for the notable differences between degree and
associate degree programmes is the absence of major government subsidy .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#75:2>
Operating on a self-financing basis , the providers have stuck to
financially viable courses , meaning those perceived to have a strong demand
from employers , and , by assumption , students . </p> <O> A photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#76:2>
Although the Government subsidises most of the student costs in
mainstream university studies , to the tune of &dollar;185,000 per person
each year , AD course providers have to rely on tuition fees to cover their
expenses .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#77:2>
The only form of government assistance is the no-interest short-term
loans for renting or buying premises . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#78:2>
President of Caritas Francis Hsu College , Liu Ping-cheung , said
tuition fees covered 85 per cent of the operating costs of their AD
programmes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#79:2>
He said other non-governmental organisations were interested in but
prevented from offering AD programmes due to a lack of suitable premises and
government support .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#80:2>
The common concern about costs is not allayed by the Government  ' s
decision to offer AD students grants or means-tested loans with a ceiling of
&dollar;60,000 , subject to an interest rate equivalent to two per cent off
the prime rate plus a 1.5 per cent risk factor . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#81:2>
&ldquo; Students who take loans from the Government will have
accumulated debts of almost &dollar;100,000 when they graduate , but it is
unknown whether they will reap the benefits and be accepted by universities
then , &rdquo; said Chui Yat-hung , director of Hok Yau Club  ' s student
guidance centre . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#82:2>
He also noted students were deprived of the chance of learning
what really interested them because of the limited range of subjects on offer .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#83:2>
The same view is held by the Open University  ' s vice-president Danny
Wong Shek-nam .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#84:2>
He said the current emphasis on courses with market value could mean
an associate degree and the onward link to full degree in areas such Chinese
history would not be available . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#85:2>
Recognising the potential problem , the University Grants
Committee is due to study whether there is a need to provide funding for less
mainstream courses , such as anthropology , currently not offered in any AD
programmes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#86:2>
Yet most operators do not expect the Government to provide more
funding for the new sector , though that appears to undermine the Government  ' s
target of enabling 60 per cent of secondary school leavers access to tertiary
education through an expansion in sub-degree programmes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#87:2>
It seems the Government sees AD courses as catering more to future
manpower needs than encouraging university education . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#88:2>
During a press meeting recently when the Government was asked why
it did not subsidise operators more , Secretary for Education and Manpower
Fanny Law Fan Chiu-fun noted that AD courses should be left to market forces
instead of relying on government funding .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#89:2>
So , what AD students may end up getting is a second-rate deal .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#90:2>
Most operators are resigned to the fact that the huge budget required
for education reforms in the school sector will remain its priority . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#91:2>
&ldquo; It will hurt the interests of Hong Kong if everything has
to be paid for by the Government .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#92:2>
Associate degree programmes provide students with another chance of
continuing their studies , albeit at a cost , &rdquo; said director of Space
, Professor Enoch Young .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#93:2>
But he echoed another common view that leaving the sector to volatile
market forces had its drawbacks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-016#94:2>
Subjects relating to science and technology would suffer because
of the huge amount of money needed for facilities and equipment .

<ICE-HK:W2B-016#95:2>
&ldquo; Our operating costs are high and we have to make sure our
teaching quality is not compromised , &rdquo; he added . </p>
