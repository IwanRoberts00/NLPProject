<ICE-HK:S2A-039#1:1:A>
Uhm the Po Leung Kuk is one of the most established uh
charitable organization in Hong Kong and <,> <indig> Bou Leuhng </indig>
means to protect the innocence and <indig> Guhk </indig> means uh association
organization <,> and and the Po Leung Kuk <,> now today is famous for its
comprehensive social recreational and educational services for children uhm
the handicap and the elderly but in fact when uh the Kuk was established in
uh eighteen seventeen-eight uh its establishment was necessitated by the
great problem of uh kidnapping uh uh <?> kidnapping </?> of uh women and
children uhm for domestic services uh adoption <,> marriage and prostitution
<,> and in fact uhm some of the destitutes involved were <indig> muih jai
</indig> or domestic servant girls and actually kidnapping is just one of the
<?> abuses </?> uhm that <indig> muih jai </indig> might encounter

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#2:1:A>
Other than this uh for example they might be uh overworked <,>
beaten up <,> or sexually harassed by their masters <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#3:1:A>
The Po Leung Kuk cared for different kinds of <?> abuse </?> <indig>
muih jai </indig> > regardless whether they had been kidnapped or not <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#4:1:A>
The term <indig> muih jai </indig> is a Cantonese <?> colloquial
</?> expression <,> in written Chinese or for Mandarin speaking people uhm
<indig> muih jai </indig> this term is expressed a uh as uh <foreign> bi nu
</foreign> or <indig> peih neuih </indig> okay uhm <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#5:1:A>
Uh <foreign> bi nu </foreign> means uh domestic servant so uhm
although <indig> muih jai </indig> can be interpreted as uh small uh small
girls and small uhm adopted uh daughters or uhm younger sister actually uhm
the girls <indig> muih jai </indig> were actually domestic servants <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#6:1:A>
According to the <indig> muih jai </indig> custom a girl was
transferred directly or indirectly from her family to another family uhm <,>
for the purpose of being uhm a domestic servant <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#7:1:A>
Uh indirectly means uh they <?> might </?> be uh transferred through
a middleman <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#8:1:A>
okay <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#9:1:A>
And during the transfer money was given by the prospective master
<,> to the girl  ' s family <,> and the customary practice was that a <indig>
muih jai </indig> did not receive any regular wage <,> but uhm her master was
obliged to provide her with sufficient lodging clothing accommodation and
medical care <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#10:1:A>
When the girl was uhm eighteen years old uhm usually uhm the uh
master was also obliged to find a suitable husband for her <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#11:1:A>
Uhm <,> if the <indig> muih jai  ' s </indig> parents or other family
members desired to recover the girl before the girl reach eighteen years old
<,> the family members had to uh repay the money uh which they receive from
uhm the masters during the transfer <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#12:1:A>
The system <indig> muih jai </indig> system existed in <?> Chinese
</?> society since time immemorial but uh still in the early twentieth
century the practice pervade in the colony <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#13:1:A>
The census for the year uh nineteen twenty-one is the only census
<,> which shows the estimated number of uh <indig> muih jai </indig> uh in
Hong Kong and we find that there were altogether uhm the sixth item <,> of
the first table <,> there are there were around eight thousand <indig> muih
jai </indig> uh in nineteen twenty-one and we find that the system pervade in
the colony in the sense that you find that uhm <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#14:1:A>
Being being a <indig> muih jai </indig> was the sixth most common
uh occupations among the whole Chinese population <,> and as for uh the
female population alone uh it rank the third so uh it  ' s a very popular uh
occupation of the day <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#15:1:A>
And you can also find that uhm <,> concerning the natures of the
occupations uhm uhm <,> in which uhm females are uh were engaged you find
that most of the <,> work were related to uh domestic works needlework
domestic servants uhm <indig> muih jai </indig> or being a cook

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#16:1:A>
Uh domestic servants here <,> uh in the census this term refer to
to some paid uh domestic servants

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#17:1:A>
That means uh they were receiving uhm regular uhm monetary wages
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#18:1:A>
Uhm <,> but for the defenders of the <indig> muih jai </indig>
system they claim that uh <indig> muih jai </indig> uh were also paid in the
sense that uh lodging accommodation or medical care uh should be also be
regarded as a kind of wage <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#19:1:A>
This is uhm how the defenders uh try to defend the system <,>
saying that <indig> muih jai </indig> were actually paid servants <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#20:1:A>
Okay <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#21:1:A>
However it is difficult to prove the problems of of <?> abuse </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#22:1:A>
On the one hand it was not until December nineteen twenty-nine that
<indig> muih jai </indig> were required to be registered <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#23:1:A>
Moreover uh registration was not uh uhm strictly enforced <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#24:1:A>
A number of masters evaded registration by calling their domestic
servants <,> adopted daughters <indig> yeuhng neuih </indig> <,> instead

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#25:1:A>
In nineteen thirty the Anti- <indig> muih jai </indig> Society
claim that at least four thousand <indig> muih jai </indig> had evaded
registration in that way <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#26:1:A>
It is not known how far the estimate is correct <,> but anyway the
documents uh of the Po Leung Kuk Archives do reflect such disguise and I will
uh explain more about uhm the Archives later <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#27:1:A>
Very often such disguise was uncovered when the owners described
their <indig> muih jai </indig> as <indig> yeuhng neuih </indig> <,> while
the girls identified themselves as <indig> muih jai </indig> or when the
girls call themselves <indig> yeuhng neuih </indig> but their adopted parents
<indig> jyu yahu </indig> masters

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#28:1:A>
On the other hand the ignorance of the girls themselves also
accounted for the fact that <,> a number of <?> abuses </?> were not reported
<,> but such ineffectiveness does not necessarily imply that uhm <.> m </.>
most of the <indig> muih jai </indig> were maltreated

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#29:1:A>
There were still uhm a wide range of possibilities between uhm
being maltreated and being well-treated <,> Uh we didn't know <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#30:1:A>
Uhm <,> but nevertheless the Po Leung Kuk Archives documents show
that abuse did exist although uh we can't prove the to what extent <?> abuse
</?> uh <,> was prevalent <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#31:1:A>
Nature of abuse <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#32:1:A>
For example uhm for the year nineteen twenty-three <,,> there were
three cases concerning masters <?> afflicting gross cruelty </?> on their
<indig> muih jai </indig> and in nineteen twenty-nine seven and what does
that mean <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#33:1:A>
For instance in nineteen twenty-three a <indig> muih jai  ' s
</indig> chest was burnt by <,> her master simply because she had broken a
cup <,> and in nineteen twenty-nine another <indig> muih jai </indig> was
severely caned for carrying water late while another girl had to <?> massage
</?> her mistress till midnight every day <,> and <,> here are some other
kinds of uh <?> abuses </?> <,> inflicted on <indig> muih jai </indig>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#34:1:A>
The second <.> col </.> no the second row

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#35:1:A>
Masters reselling or intending to <.> s </.> resell their <indig>
muih jai </indig> as prostitutes

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#36:1:A>
And then <,> girls kidnapped by adoption or <?> decoyed </?> for
the purpose of selling them to other masters as <indig> muih jai </indig> or
prostitutes <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#37:1:A>
<indig> Muih jai </indig> sexually harass by their masters or male
members at their <.> work </.> workplaces <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#38:1:A>
And actually you you you you will find that uhm it seems that the
number of cases uh is very small uhm but I will explain why there were just
uh one cases or just a few cases discovered uh for certain kind of uh <?>
abuses </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#39:1:A>
I will explain this later <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#40:1:A>
And I have mentioned the Po Leung Kuk Archives for a number of
times and now I  ' m going to uhm give you more details about it <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#41:1:A>
And my presentation that follows <,,> will be made according to
these headlines

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#42:1:A>
The daily operation of the Kuk <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#43:1:A>
How <?> abuse </?> was discovered <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#44:1:A>
The colonial government relied on the voluntary organizations of
the Chinese community especially the Tung Wah Hospital established in <,> uh
eighteen sixty-nine <,> uhm to fight the abuse of the <indig> muih jai
</indig> custom <,> and uh since nine since eighteen seventy-eight with the
establishment of the Po Leung Kuk it was the Po Leung Kuk which specialize in
<,> uhm combating uh the those inherent in the <indig> muih jai </indig>
custom <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#45:1:A>
The government was delighted with the formation of the Kuk as it
help to relieve the government  ' s social responsibility and <.> finan </.>
and financial burden related to the destitute <indig> muih jai </indig> <,,>
okay <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#46:1:A>
Uhm since eighteen eighty the Po Leung Kuk had employed two special
Chinese detectives <,> to uncover kidnap cases <,> they their wages being
defrayed out of the society  ' s fund

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#47:1:A>
They were called <,> <indig> ngam chaai </indig> uhm <foreign> an
chai </foreign> <,> meaning secret detectives <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#48:1:A>
Since eighteen ninety-two district watchmen <,> they were the
security guards of the Chinese population literally called <indig> gang lihn
</indig> <,> <foreign> geng lian </foreign> in Chinese <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#49:1:A>
They were seconded to the Kuk as detectives who were paid by the
society <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#50:1:A>
In the nineteen uh in the twentieth century as the Kuk  ' s documents
show <,> the district watchmen took up more duties <?> than </?> it was first
intended for them

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#51:1:A>
They were not only investigators but also the runners for the Kuk
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#52:1:A>
Uhm they helped destitutes search for their parents relatives or
friends <,> help the police to bring destitutes to the Secretary for Chinese
Affairs office <,> and then the Po Leung Kuk for investigation or help the
SCA Secretary for Chinese Affairs to transfer them to <?> charitable </?>
organizations which would look for their parents or make other proper
arrangements for them and this will explain later <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#53:1:A>
On the other hand it must be noted that investigation was also
undertaken by the Po Leung Kuk  ' s Associate <,> Organizations or individuals
within or beyond the colony <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#54:1:A>
With the assistance the workload of the Kuk and the detectives was
uh uh alleviated and the efficiency of investigation could be promoted <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#55:1:A>
Besides the documents in the Archives related to the <indig> muih
jai </indig> practice for the years nineteen O one twenty-three twenty-nine
and forty reveal that it was only in the nineteen twenties that <,> ordinary
people came forward to report on abuses

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#56:1:A>
It was usually the girls themselves <,> or their parents and
relatives who lodged complaints or sought assistance

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#57:1:A>
At times the neighbor of a <indig> muih jai  ' s </indig> master or
even a passerby who witness <?> abuse </?> make such reports and this
inspiring atmosphere uhm <,> began to grow uhm in the early nineteen twenties
and this growth is much more apparent uh throughout the nineteen thirties
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#58:1:A>
How cases were handled at the Kuk <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#59:1:A>
Whenever a Po Leung Kuk detective found a suspected person <,> uh
that means uh suspected of uh having kidnapped a girl <,> he was obliged to
inform the <.> S </.> Secretary for Chinese Affairs uhm or the Registrar
General uh before nineteen <.> thir </.> thirteen of the case and take the
person involved to the SCA  ' s office first <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#60:1:A>
The SCA would inquire into the case <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#61:1:A>
Yet very often the little girls might be unable to or unwilling to
clarify their situations because of their fear of the authorities <,> or they
might have been forced and taught by the kidnappers or their owners to tell
lies <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#62:1:A>
Therefore the SCA would send uhm the <indig> muih jai </indig> to
the SCA uh sorry uh the SCA would send the victims to the Po Leung Kuk where
they would be interviewed <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#63:1:A>
Uhm occasionally <,> the girls were discovered by the police or the
harbour master  ' s office <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#64:1:A>
It might also be <indig> muih jai </indig> themselves who reported
to the police

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#65:1:A>
Similarly the girls would be taken to the SCA  ' s office which would
keep a record of them

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#66:1:A>
Then they would be referred to the uh Po Leung Kuk for further
questioning and investigation <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#67:1:A>
A <indig> muih jai </indig> taken to the Kuk would be interviewed
by at least two directors <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#68:1:A>
She would be questioned about her personal particulars her family
and whether she would like to be restored to her family or her masters alike
<,> uhm <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#69:1:A>
And this uh all these testimonies <,> were compiled as <,>
testimonies of inmates of the Kuk <,> and this is one type of <,> uhm
important information we can <,> get from the Po Leung Kuk Archives

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#70:1:A>
Testimonies of destitutes staying in the Po Leung Kuk <indig> lauh
guhk uaahn fuh yuh hau gung bouh </indig> and as far as I know uh after I
have uh <.> wri </.> written up uh my thesis I know that uh the Po Leung Kuk
uhm had already uhm made a systematic uh <.> tran </.> uh translation uh of
these uh works uh so maybe uh you may get different names uh <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#71:1:A>
The name may not be testimonies of destitutes staying uh in the in
the Po Leung Kuk

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#72:1:A>
Uh I don't know uh what names they have given uh uh to those uhm uh
documents <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#73:1:A>
Yet sometimes there were dishonest girls who tell lies to <?>
conceal </?> their misconduct

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#74:1:A>
For instance in nineteen twenty-three a <indig> muih jai </indig>
called uh <indig> leih yih la </indig> told the SCA that she was <?> enticed
</?> to leave her mistress by a man who wanted to marry her but the mistress
complained to the SCA that the <indig> muih jai </indig> had uhm and the man
might have stolen her jewelry and the girl was sent uh by the SCA to the Po
Leung Kuk where the directors uh question the girl and <,> finally it was
found that the girl did steal the jewelry <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#75:1:A>
In fact not only the girls but all persons involved would be
summoned and questions by uh the directors

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#76:1:A>
They might be uh their parents or their uh uh masters or <.> any
</.> anyone uhm in the in the girls  '  workplaces <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#77:1:A>
To ensure the reliability of the information obtained <,> similarly
testimonies were prepared for them and you can find here number two
Testimonies of Outsiders

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#78:1:A>
<mention> Outsiders </mention> refers to uh persons other than the
inmates of uh the Po Leung Kuk or other than the <?> words </?> of the Po
Leung Kuk <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#79:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#80:1:A>
And I have a photocopy uhm of the testimonies involved <,> and you
find that uh <,> I have to cross out <?> part </?> of the private names of uh
of the girls because uh we have to protect their privacy <,> and uh for
documents uh of the nineteenth century you don't need to go through uh this
uh crossing out process

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#81:1:A>
Okay you are you are free to uh to make photocopies on on those uh
documents <,> but for the documents uh of the twentieth century uhm the staff
would uh would uh carefully examine whether uh those private names had been
uh properly cross out <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#82:1:A>
All the documents are written in Chinese and uh just a very small
amount are written in uh uhm <,> in English and most probably uhm <.> the
</.> the correspondence between uhm <,> between a particular society uh with
uh the Kuk

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#83:1:A>
So actually uh over <.> nine </.> ninety percent of the the
documents are written in Chinese and uhm <,> and you are going to read some
of those uh copies of the of the documents and you find that uh they are not
only written in Chinese but some very grassy uh Chinese calligraphy

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#84:1:A>
So uhm <,> before you really want to spend uh time on your research
with uh the Archives you should uh try to find out whether you have the <?>
patience </?> and you have the uh ability to handle those grassy uh
characters <,> and before I uh I took up my research my supervisor ask me to
stay more time with the the Archive first before I  ' m determined to take up
my research

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#85:1:A>
Uh she fear that I may not be impatient with those words <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#86:1:A>
For each case the testimonies would be laid before the directors
for discussion at a committee meeting

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#87:1:A>
These meetings were held every night some directors attended the
committee meeting particularly on Sundays while some others every night <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#88:1:A>
If the directors believe that <,> certain persons had cruelly
treated their own <indig> muih jai </indig> or were kidnappers they would
suggest prosecutions to the SCA

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#89:1:A>
With the SCA  ' s consent the defendants would be delivered to the
SCA  ' s office which <?> did </?> had the authority to send them to court for
prosecutions <,> but as far as the girl was concerned a number of complicated
procedures and considerations leading to the settlement of the girl must be
undergone <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#90:1:A>
Certain procedures were specially tailored to confirm <,>
identities and fight impersonation

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#91:1:A>
Methods were also devise to check further abuses against their
words

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#92:1:A>
Family reunion <,> adoption marriage or restoration to masters may
be arranged to the girls

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#93:1:A>
All the discussions involved would be recorded as minutes forming
<indig> ji sih luhk </indig> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#94:1:A>
The third item <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#95:1:A>
Records of events

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#96:1:A>
That means they are the minutes of those discussions among uh the
directors <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#97:1:A>
The resolutions <,> would be submitted to the SCA as suggestions
for the disposal of the girls <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#98:1:A>
With the approval of the SCA those suggestions could be carried out
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-039#99:1:A>
The correspondence between the Po Leung Kuk and the SCA were
compiled as <,> uh the fourth one correspondence from or to the Registrar
General and after and and in <.> s </.> nineteen thirteen uh the registrar
general was renamed as uh Secretary for Chinese Affairs <,,> </I>
