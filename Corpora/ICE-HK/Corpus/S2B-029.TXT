<ICE-HK:S2B-029#1:1:A>
SAR workers have yet to feel any benefit from the economics
recovery

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#2:1:A>
This was the observation that Premier Zhu Rongji made known to
reporters after the Association of Southeast Asian <,> Nations meeting in
Singapore last month

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#3:1:A>
For many of the compatriots living in Hong Kong who feel the pinch
of the economic downturn this piece of remarks by one of the Chinese leaders
has definitely struck a chord

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#4:1:A>
Premier Zhu also added that he had learned a lesson <,> from SAR
workers ' grievances and pledged a pay rise for mainland workers next year

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#5:1:A>
It was a rare occasion that mainland workers became the envy of
their SAR comrades

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#6:1:A>
In fact <,> Donald Tsang Yam-kuen Financial Secretary was quick to
respond to the remarks

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#7:1:A>
He pointed out harshly but correctly that wages in Hong Kong are
determined by the market

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#8:1:A>
When the economy further improves and companies make more profits
employers would consider pay rises in light of the situation of their
businesses <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#9:1:A>
As a matter of fact Hong Kong economy has recorded a very strong
growth for the first three quarters of two thousand

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#10:1:A>
Following the growth of fourteen point two percent in the first
quarter and ten point nine percent in the second quarter GDP again attained a
double-digit growth at ten point four percent in real terms over the year
earlier <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#11:1:A>
For the first three quarters of two thousand as a whole GDP had a
highly robust growth of eleven point seven percent in real terms over a year
earlier

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#12:1:A>
As a result the forecast growth rate in real terms of GDP for two
thousand as a whole was revised upward from the earlier eight point five
percent to ten percent

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#13:1:A>
On the other hand the unemployment rate showed a further decline in
September to November two thousand to four point six percent slightly lower
than that <,> in August to October two thousand at four point seven percent

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#14:1:A>
The unemployment rate stood at two point six percent in September
to November two thousand same as that in August to October period

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#15:1:A>
With all these promising figures it is not surprising that a number
of major local corporations and banks have already indicated that pay rises
from two to five percent will be awarded to employees

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#16:1:A>
With all these good news Premier Zhu should be happy for these
lucky ones

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#17:1:A>
Again Financial Secretary Tsang demonstrated his good understanding
of the market economy

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#18:1:A>
Good for you Donald <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#19:1:A>
Then is Hong Kong really on the road of recovery

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#20:1:A>
Maybe

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#21:1:A>
Even if it is <,> it would be a very long road particularly for
those who are badly hurt by the troubled economy

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#22:1:A>
The middle class is among those most hard- hit

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#23:1:A>
Many of them are facing shrinkage in the values of their assets

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#24:1:A>
As owners of negative-equity properties they lost their life
savings when the property prices went downward in the past few years

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#25:1:A>
As investors they were beaten twice in the stock market <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#26:1:A>
First in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis and second in
the burst of the dot com bubble earlier this year

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#27:1:A>
As professionals they have to compete for jobs at lower fees

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#28:1:A>
As managerial executives they have to accept more workload with
lower pay

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#29:1:A>
As entrepreneurs they have to face a tougher market

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#30:1:A>
As a matter of fact <,> quite a number of them are among the
statistics of layoffs and bankrupts

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#31:1:A>
As the government is cutting fat <,> many middle-income earners
working in the government also feel the pinch of the economic difficulties

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#32:1:A>
Although civil servants are supposed to enjoy job security many of
them are facing uncertainties with the possible privatisation of their
departments or rigid adherence to their bosses to the Enhanced Productivity
Programme

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#33:1:A>
The government  ' s cost-trimming exercise has also affected those
non-civil servant professionals and staff working in the government projects

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#34:1:A>
Take my constituents <,> engineers as an example newly recruited
resident site engineers for government projects have to accept salaries at
lower entry points and a very harsh four-month break in service rule

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#35:1:A>
If the middle class is in such a sorry state you can imagine the
predicaments of those who aspire to join the rank

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#36:1:A>
Again <,> I want to quote an example from my constituency to
illustrate my point <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#37:1:A>
In the past engineer graduates who wished to join civil service as
government engineers would usually join the Works Bureau Graduate Training
Scheme

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#38:1:A>
A number of graduates of ninety-six and ninety-seven <,> joined the
scheme with the hope <,> that they might follow the footsteps of their
seniors and became <,> civil servants upon the completion of the Training
Scheme

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#39:1:A>
Alas

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#40:1:A>
The economic downturn has completely wrecked their plans

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#41:1:A>
As government departments have to follow the Enhanced Productivity
Programme only a handful of permanent posts are made available to those young
engineers

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#42:1:A>
It is most disappointing to see that these brilliant young
engineers intensively trained by the government are only offered non-civil
service contract with very unfavourable employment terms

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#43:1:A>
Worse still they will have to leave the government when their
current employment contracts expire

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#44:1:A>
Like other young professionals these young engineers are facing
many uncertainties in their future

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#45:1:A>
But one thing is certain they are on the wrong side of timing

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#46:1:A>
Indeed <,> some people have argued that the middle class is the
only victim in this economic meltdown

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#47:1:A>
The rich are too wealthy to feel the pinch while the poor have
nothing to lose

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#48:1:A>
I see their point about the rich particularly some of the super
rich but I cannot agree with their argument about the poor

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#49:1:A>
They are right that the poor <,> own no properties and they don't
have the problems with negative-equity

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#50:1:A>
They are right that the poor own no stock shares and they don't
have problems with slides in the stock prices <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#51:1:A>
However they are wrong to say that the poor have nothing to lose

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#52:1:A>
At least there is one thing that the poor can lose and the only one
thing that they cannot afford to lose ie their jobs

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#53:1:A>
As a matter of fact many low-skilled workers in Hong Kong were
amongst the first casualties in the present economic adjustments

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#54:1:A>
The present economic situation has further marginalised the
low-income group to no-income group

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#55:1:A>
Believe it or not one-sixth of the households living in public
rental housing flats <,> about one hundred and fifteen thousand families are
relying on welfare or the so-called Comprehensive Social Security <.> As </.>
Assistance

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#56:1:A>
The government was heartless enough to push through the increase in
fees and charges last week

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#57:1:A>
Although many colleagues in Legco voted for the increase I did not
agree with it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#58:1:A>
My line of thinking is very simple

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#59:1:A>
Despite the promising economic figures released recently <,> a
strong recovery is not in sight

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#60:1:A>
It is not the right time to seek the increase as many people out
there have difficulties in making ends meet while many businesses are
struggling for the survival

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#61:1:A>
Instead of wasting their precious time in lobbying the Legco
members to support the increase which will only bring in about seven million
to the government coffers in the coming year the government officials should
have much better things to do for instance to revive our economy <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#62:1:A>
Feeling the urgency I suggested to two Legco members that we could
join forces with construction- related professional bodies to push the
government to speed up the implementation of infrastructure

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#63:1:A>
As you are aware the government has committed to invest more than
two hundred and forty billion dollars in infrastructure development in the
coming few years

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#64:1:A>
These projects will be instrumental in spurring our economy and
creating many jobs for local professionals and workers

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#65:1:A>
However little progress has been made to many of these projects as
they get entangled with bureaucratic red tape and land resumption problems

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#66:1:A>
We already had our first meeting with representatives of ten
professional bodies to make out our action plan <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#67:1:A>
So far the government is strong in its rhetoric and weak in its
actions

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#68:1:A>
It is time for it to do something to speed up the economic recovery
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#69:1:A>
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year </I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-029#70:2:A>
The term sustainable development was first introduced in
nineteen eighty seven in a report Our Common Future produced by the World
Commission on Environment and Development WCED

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#71:2:A>
There it was defined as development that meets the needs of the
present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their
own needs

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#72:2:A>
The nineteen ninety two United Nation Conference for Environment
and Development also known as Rio Earth Summit adopted this definition and to
date over one hundred countries are making efforts to promote sustainable
development

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#73:2:A>
And Hong Kong is one of them <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#74:2:A>
As I recall the Chief Executive raised the subject in his nineteen
ninety eight Policy Address

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#75:2:A>
He went further in his Policy Address the following year and
announced that the intention to establish a Sustainable Development Unit SDU
to monitor the impact of major new policy proposals and provide analysis and
support to a proposed Council for Sustainable Development CSD

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#76:2:A>
The first Legislative Council also discussed the subject in a form
of a motion debate in October nineteen ninety eight

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#77:2:A>
Basically sustainable development provides a framework of economic
growth and development with minimum negative impact on resources available to
us and this allows our society to continue functioning into the indefinite
future

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#78:2:A>
In order words the concept focuses growth maximizing benefits in
the long run rather than short-term gains

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#79:2:A>
But one may wonder what exactly the concept is relevant to us

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#80:2:A>
The final definition of sustainable development for Study on
Sustainable Development for the twenty-first century in short SUSDEV twenty
one provides enlightenment <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#81:2:A>
Quote sustainable development in Hong Kong balances social economic
environmental and resource needs both for present and future generations
simultaneously achieving a vibrant economy social progress and a high quality
environment locally nationally and internationally through the efforts of the
community and the government unquote

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#82:2:A>
The elaboration of the Secretary for Planning and Lands Mr Gordon
Siu at a recent press conference announcing the findings and recommendations
of SUSDEV may provide you a better guide

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#83:2:A>
He said sustainable development is an abstract concept

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#84:2:A>
To implement this concept we have to apply it in a practical life
in different aspects including economy health hygiene natural resources
social facilities cultural activities and transportation

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#85:2:A>
If you are still unable to grasp the concept don't blame yourself

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#86:2:A>
And don't put the blame on Gordon either

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#87:2:A>
He made a very nice try by relating the concept to practical life

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#88:2:A>
You may perhaps be too occupied with problems in practical life to
see the whole picture of its relevance to you

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#89:2:A>
Think about it

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#90:2:A>
What sustainable development means to you if you are at home
exposed to high levels of traffic noise

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#91:2:A>
What the sustainable development means to you when you walk in
major roads and streets <,> of Causeway Bay or Central in days of high Air
Pollution Index API

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#92:2:A>
What sustainable development means to you when you look at the
deplorable state of our treasured Victoria Harbour

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#93:2:A>
Road traffic noise is one of the most pervasive forms of pollution
in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#94:2:A>
Close to a million people suffer road traffic noise higher than the
minimum acceptable standard <,> seventy dba in the Hong Kong Planning
Standards and Guidelines

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#95:2:A>
There must be a finite but hard-to-calculate amount of adverse
effect of traffic noise on these people and their health

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#96:2:A>
I don't think sustainable development means much to these people
unless their homes become a quieter place

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#97:2:A>
Indeed various measures can be introduced to address this traffic
noise problem

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#98:2:A>
These include installing roadside barriers and enclosures roads

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#99:2:A>
Resurfacing roads with low noise surface materials or change of
road alignment can also bring some relief to those households being affected

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#100:2:A>
In areas where it is infeasible to introduce these measures the
government ought to <.> in </.> identify other suitable non-engineering noise
mitigation alternatives namely banning heavy vehicles on certain roads speed
reduction or pedestrianization

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#101:2:A>
Believe it or not even a simple measure such as covering manhole
caps with asphalt in roads will definitely relieve thousands of nearby
residents from the flip-flops caused by the metal caps being rolled over by
passing vehicles

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#102:2:A>
Talking about noise pollution it is very unfair not to mention
those households being affected by the aircraft noise

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#103:2:A>
It is true the aircraft noise has ended for those living under the
Kai Tak airport flight path with the relocation of the airport to Chek Lap
Kok <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#104:2:A>
However the government must be responsive to the concern of the
residents living under the new flight paths who were previously unaffected

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#105:2:A>
The government has the responsibility to study and implement noise
mitigation measures to address their problems

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#106:2:A>
Now let us turn to another subject <,> about the air we breath

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#107:2:A>
In case you like many of our senior officials live in an
air-conditioned environment all the time just take a walk in Causeway Bay
Central or Mong Kok you will get a pretty good idea of how bad our air
quality has turned into

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#108:2:A>
Or if you are a scientific-minded person just go to study the API
records for the past few years

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#109:2:A>
The same conclusion can be reached

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#110:2:A>
Every time when the API hits record high the authorities give us a
list of factors accounting for the poor air quality such as airborne
pollutants from the Pearl River Delta or the absence of air movement to
dispel the pollutants at street level or emissions from buses and diesel
vehicles et cetera et cetera

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#111:2:A>
As a routine <,> the government always takes every opportunity to
reiterate that cleaning up the air is high on its agenda but it takes time
for the improvement

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#112:2:A>
I totally agree that there is no miracle

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#113:2:A>
We can't just have clean air overnight

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#114:2:A>
Even so the air quality in Hong Kong should have stopped
deteriorating

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#115:2:A>
However it seems not to be the case in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#116:2:A>
If the government is incapable in solving our air pollution
problem it is at least capable in screwing up our treasured Victoria Harbour

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#117:2:A>
I must say that the Harbour looks more like a nullah now

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#118:2:A>
I don't want to repeat here the fiasco of the expensive Strategic
Sewage Disposal Scheme SSDS which is a long and controversial story

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#119:2:A>
All I hope is that the government can become wiser after the
expensive lesson and will act shrewdly to come up with the best sustainable
option for the urban sewage disposal and treatment

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#120:2:A>
Unless the government can see things from the perspective of
ordinary people it will have problems in enlisting the support and
involvement of the community in the sustainable development in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-029#121:2:A>
Unless the government can show its determination to solve our
environmental problems the term of sustainable development means no more than
rhetoric or just another high-sounding concept </I>
