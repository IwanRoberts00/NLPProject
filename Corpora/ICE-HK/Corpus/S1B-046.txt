This is Jonathan Fenby welcoming you to this the latest in our
Saturday morning interviews <?> lock </?> here on Radio Three

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X3:1:Z>
I  ' m editor of the South China Morning Post and Sunday Morning Post

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X4:1:Z>
And each Saturday morning I talk to leading figure in Hong Kong
about uh himself or herself about what  ' s on their mind this weekend about
their life career and how they see the future of the territory

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X5:1:Z>
I  ' m very pleased to have my guest this morning Democratic Party
legislator Law Chi Kwong who  ' s uh part <?> of the </?> party secretary
representative for the social welfare profession and also the Democratic
Party spokesperson on health and woman issues

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X6:1:Z>
<{> <[> <unc> one-word </unc> hello </[> a woman speaks a
woman  ' s issue </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-046#7:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#8:1:A>
Uh we don't have any one <?> inter </?> Legco who is female <{> <[>
for </[> the for the for the Democratic Party <&>

<$A> laughs </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X9:1:Z>
<[> The </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X10:1:Z>
So that  ' s for you

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X11:1:Z>
How did you get into politics </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-046#12:1:A>
Uh I have been participating in a social movements in helping
people to fight for more uh uh a a better <,> welfare for the for the uh uh
under privilege

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#13:1:A>
I always been playing the role as a more like a a <unc>
one-word </unc> of assisting helping uh uh discussing policy and things
like that

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#14:1:A>
But <,> but since nineteen ninety early nineteen ninety uh we are
facing the election in nineteen ninety one <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#15:1:A>
At that time I I <?> al </?> I always <?> discussing </?> with
friends and said that uh it  ' s I I do consider it  ' s very important to form a
democratic party as such and to unite all the different small groups <{2>
<[2> together so </[2> that we stand a chance of <{3> <[3> uh </[3> winning
the election in nineteen ninety one because of the limited number of people
we have and the limited resource that we have

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#16:1:A>
If we don't <,> group together <{4> <[4> and </[4> uh resolve the
conflict within a party rather than among groups

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X17:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X18:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X19:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X20:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X21:1:Z>
How many groups were there at that time <{> <[> <unc> one-word
</unc> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X22:1:Z>
They were they were over the place </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-046#23:1:A>
<[> Numerous numerous and they </[> </{> all over the place

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#24:1:A>
But there  ' s such several major groups <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> major
groups but but then uh in in a past experience in terms of uh District Broad
elections uhm uh Urban Council election

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#25:1:A>
Because they they are all not to together so so at the time when
they decided I I would go for election and then sudden discover another group
have another representative <{2> <[2> standing </[2> the same <{3> <[3> same
same constituency </[3> then

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#26:1:A>
Then it  ' s very hard to resolve at that stage <{4> <[4> <,> </[4>
once you make all those <.> de </.> decision go through all the processes and
then sudden realize that there  ' s competition from a friendly group

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#27:1:A>
<{5> <[5> So </[5> the the best thing is to have all those things
resolved before decision was made <{6> <[6> <,> </[6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#28:1:A>
So so the party is something I  ' ve I would consider as essential

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#29:1:A>
So that time okay let  ' s let  ' s get together and then started uh
forming a a party so we form the United Democrats of Hong Kong at that time

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#30:1:A>
I I was particularly uh <,> <&> tut </&> sort of responsible for
the uh organizing in terms of policy research the <?> researcher </?> and how
how they can assist the party in forming uh <?> pla </?> platforms uh
election platform <?> so </?> the nineteen ninety one election

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#31:1:A>
So from that time onwards I I I was in the party

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X32:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X33:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X34:1:Z>
<[3> Same yeah </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X35:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X36:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X37:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X38:1:Z>
You were you were organizer </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-046#39:1:A>
Part of the <{> <[> organizer yeah </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X40:1:Z>
<[> Yeah yeah yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X41:1:Z>
And at that point coming to <?> your </?> background you come from
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X42:1:Z>
Did you see the formation of the party and the party if you like
sitting down roots has been largely concerned with livelihood issues <,>
rather than with uh make a political matters </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-046#43:1:A>
I I would say both are very important <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> uh
<,> running up to nineteen ninety seven we all know that uh to <,> to develop
a more uh open and a free society is <{2> <[2> very important for </[2> the
transition

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#44:1:A>
And for political party which will stand firm on this issue it  ' s
very important <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#45:1:A>
We know that people will will start changing their position from
time to time <{4> <[4> and they when </[4> they get closer to nineteen ninety
seven

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#46:1:A>
So we should have a party which <,> which have a substantial force
<,> consolidation of power within the community which can stand firm <{5>
<[5> and </[5> that would give very important confidence for people <,> in
Hong Kong who  ' s who who would know that at the time of this difficult time
there are are people who are <?> consideral </?> in terms of uh <,> number
and power in in in in uh Hong Kong which would stand firm on this issue

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X47:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X48:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X49:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X50:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X51:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X52:1:Z>
Are we <{> <[> <unc> two words </unc> uh </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-046#53:1:A>
<[> Certain principle </[> </{> like democracy open <{1> <[1>
society uh </[1> free competition things like that

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#54:1:A>
<{2> <[2> Uhm </[2> <,> but the same time we are the group of
people in the seventies and eighties who are primary concerned with uh
livelihood <{3> <[3> issue so <,> so so so so they </[3> they they is a uh uh
uh <unc> one-word </unc> of two concerns <{4> <[4> together </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#55:1:A>
Uh because of this group of people who are or the same time concern
about uh livelihood issue at the time <{5> <[5> concern </[5> about issue
like democracy <{6> <[6> freedom </[6> and uh and and open <{7> <[7> society
</[7>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X56:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X57:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X58:1:Z>
<[3> <unc> one-word </unc> coming for <unc> one-word
</unc> background </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X59:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X60:1:Z>
<[5> Yeah </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X61:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X62:1:Z>
<[7> Uhm </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X63:1:Z>
You know television interview few weeks ago uh Tung Chee Hwa was
asked about <,> livelihood issue

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X64:1:Z>
He said was what  ' s most on people  ' s mind as <?> against </?>
political liberties

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X65:1:Z>
He said the first was more important <unc> one-word </unc>
he he personally place the first more important the second

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X66:1:Z>
Do you think any conflict between the two

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X67:1:Z>
I mean it seems to me actually they <,> they are different </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-046#68:1:A>
Uh to certain extent it  ' s true if if we talk about uh people  ' s
concern <{1> <[1> they </[1> are always more concern about <,> about their
own livelihood issues

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#69:1:A>
So when you ask them what are the issue they are more concern but
uh when you ask the people about what are the major concern of the transition
<{2> <[2> <,> </[2> that will change <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#70:1:A>
Uh if you ask people about interest or concerns about the
transition then they will talk more about freedom

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#71:1:A>
<{4> <[4> They  ' ll </[4> talk more about <.> demo </.> democracy
and this sort these are the things uh they are more concern

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#72:1:A>
But if you talk about what what what are your concern in your daily
life

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#73:1:A>
They  ' ll talk about livelihood so so it depends on the question you
<{5  <[5> ask </[5>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X74:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X75:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X76:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X77:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X78:1:Z>
<[5> The </[5> </{5> way you ask it

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X79:1:Z>
<{> <[> But </[> it  ' s also is there a link in the in a an open a
free society it  ' s more likely that the <?> tensional </?> replace to uhm
disparities in in welfare and labour and living condition and so on

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X80:1:Z>
In fact the two there  ' s a connection </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-046#81:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#82:1:A>
Exactly exactly

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#83:1:A>
Uh without a free open and and a democratic society it  ' s very
difficult to protect those livelihood <{1> <[1> issues and to the <,>
particular the weak yes </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#84:1:A>
Yes indeed and uh and also <.> wou </.> when when there is a more
democratic society then people will the the voices of those under privilege
will be more <,> outspoken will be will be heard and discussion in society

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#85:1:A>
So they are they  ' re closely related and <,> and that  ' s why <,> we
are the group of people who are concerned with both <{2> <[2> issues </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X86:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm to <unc> one-word </unc> it among the weak <,>
the strong voice </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X87:1:Z>
<[2> Don't you </[2> </{2> yes <{> <[> uh </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X88:1:Z>
How do you think Hong Kong <.> gov </.> in terms of looking after
the under privilege the poor the weak </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-046#89:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#90:1:A>
Well I would say from time to time I feel shameful uh as a person
in a social welfare field

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#91:1:A>
From time to time we see people in who are suffering

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#92:1:A>
From time to time we see all these hardships and yet we <,> we are
not just doing enough to help <{1> <[1> them

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#93:1:A>
And </[1> uh thinking in terms of Hong Kong as the eight eighth
largest business community <{2> <[2> and </[2> all all those uh uh numbers so
and so in in the world and yet we have such a group of people still living in
<,> <unc> one-word </unc> in in a <?> commute </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#94:1:A>
I think it  ' s some sometimes very shameful

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X95:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X96:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X97:1:Z>
Oh are you put your <unc> one-word </unc> you always got
to have in this society a number of people who are on the margin outside
society <,> even is small a number class </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-046#98:1:A>
Well in very society there exist a group of people like this
<{1> <[1> but </[1> it depends on <,> whether that uh the income <?> discrab
</?> disparity so that in enormous <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#99:1:A>
In Hong Kong is particularly great <{3> <[3> is great is grow from
point point five eight something for the </[3> uh uh uh <unc> one- word
</unc> efficient

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#100:1:A>
<{4> <[4> And </[4> and it  ' s it  ' s I I <,> I I <,> the the the
number that I know of like for the US is point three something <{5> <[5> <,>
</[5> and uh and uh still they have lot of <unc> one-word </unc>
homeless <{6> <[6> <?> United States </?> </[6> and they in in you talk about
the income disparity in Hong Kong you will expect their their state of <,> of
living is very poor

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#101:1:A>
Imagine a person who walk uh who work from seven to eleven <{7>
<[7> <,> uh </[7> uh and yet earning something like four to five thousand
dollars <{8> <[8> that </[8> is incredible and yet if they have to live in a
room uh what we call wooden partition room <{9> <[9> a </[9> hundred square
feet

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#102:1:A>
Now the rent go <?> ups </?> to <,> to three thousand dollars
<{10> <[10> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#103:1:A>
I </[10> I visit Macau uh uh two days ago

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#104:1:A>
And uh and uh for three thousand dollars they they can have a a a
one thousand square feet flat already <{11> <[11> but here in </[11> Hong
Kong you can only only have a one hundred square feet wooden partition <{12>
<[12> room </[12>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X105:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X106:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X107:1:Z>
<[3> <unc> one-word </unc> is grow isn't it grow to
something as the same <unc> one-word </unc> <,> yes </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X108:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X109:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X110:1:Z>
<[6> Yes </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X111:1:Z>
<[7> Uhm </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X112:1:Z>
<[8> Uhm </[8> </{8>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X113:1:Z>
<[9> Yeah </[9> </{9>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X114:1:Z>
<[10> Uhm uhm </[10> </{10>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X115:1:Z>
<[11> Uhm uhm uhm </[11> </{11>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X116:1:Z>
<[12> Uhm </[12> </{12> uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X117:1:Z>
Is the <,> <unc> one-word </unc> development of the
economy here to run down manufactory and so on

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X118:1:Z>
Is that actually increasing the pressure on those who would have
a job in manufacturing in the past

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X119:1:Z>
There is less job and they  ' re <,> say <.> mid </.> age they <.>
mid </.> age and counter that to a new job opportunities </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-046#120:1:A>
Yes that into easy one of the uhm the cause as if all these
uh hardships <{1> <[1> among </[1> the uh lower class

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#121:1:A>
And I would say it  ' s because the the the the demand for labour
<,> uh now is particular skill towards <{2> <[2> service industries </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#122:1:A>
And for the lower part of the service industry the pay is always
very low <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#123:1:A>
And the the this this the monthly pay for for jobs like working in
McDonald and and the fast food shop had haven't been <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#124:1:A>
Uh we <?> finds </?> in the past five to ten years <{4> <[4> it  ' s
</[4> still the same rate

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X125:1:Z>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X126:1:Z>
<[2> <unc> two-words </unc> </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X127:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X128:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X129:1:Z>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X130:1:Z>
But it  ' s higher so that rate here and say some competing
economies in China <{> <[> for <?> instance </?> </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-046#131:1:A>
<[> Oh so </[> </{> so much higher <{1> <[1> and and yet the
cost of living but the cost yeah in terms of wage </[1> yes but but in terms
of cost of living <{2> <[2> in </[2> terms of purchasing power of that <{3>
<[3> particular </[3> low <{4> <[4> wage </[4>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X132:1:Z>
<[1> Yeah <unc> one-word </unc> in terms of of cost <?>
living </?> </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X133:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X134:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X135:1:Z>
<[4> Is </[4> </{4> that all for the company so cheaper to <,> do
the job somewhere else </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-046#136:1:A>
Oh yes yes <{> <[> yes yes yes </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X137:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm uhm </[> </{> uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X138:1:Z>
So what is your uh <,> the attitude reduce about the budget on
social welfare

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X139:1:Z>
I was using the word <unc> one-word </unc> you probably
use something stronger </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-046#140:1:A>
I would say it  ' s a very mean budget <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> uhm
we we have all these money save save in our in in in in the government and
yet

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#141:1:A>
There there are so many livelihood issues of the particularly the
poor the <.> disadv </.> it is advantage and yet they are not being
adequately look after

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#142:1:A>
Uhm may may be it  ' s because it  ' s a transitional <,> so call
transitional budget <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and uh the Chinese government do not
like to see a two digit growth and so they <{3> <[3> they artificially <,>
yeah yeah <?> Sunday </?> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#143:1:A>
And I think it  ' s basically artificial to cut it down to below
something below two digit

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#144:1:A>
<{4> <[4> And </[4> uh but but then but then a lot of things <,>
that we have planned to to improve like social disable service of the elderly
service of the families

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#145:1:A>
They have to reduce the growth <{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#146:1:A>
Uh even below the growth in terms of demand

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#147:1:A>
So we will expect a growing <,> shortage in some of the services
longer waiting list and heavier workload for everybody in the welfare

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#148:1:A>
Uhm because we we artificially try to reduce a growth rate when
the demand in fact grow much faster than that

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#149:1:A>
For like the CSSA the growth rate for those who are <?> unemploy
</?> getting in to this <{6> <[6> social </[6> welfare is something like
seventeen percent last year sixteen percent for the low income groups fifteen
percent of the single parent <{7> <[7> families </[7> and <,> well something
lower for the elderly still eighteen percent

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#150:1:A>
The growth are so phenomenal and yet <{8> <[8> you </[8> try to
cut the growth rate which <,> doesn't really match <,> with the growth in
demand

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#151:1:A>
And the growth of need of the very <,> the the the lower part of
the <,> of the society

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X152:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X153:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X154:1:Z>
<[3> <unc> two-words </unc> basic call uh <unc>
one-word </unc> </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X155:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X156:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X157:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X158:1:Z>
<[7> Uhm </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X159:1:Z>
<[8> Yeah </[8> </{8>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X160:1:Z>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X161:1:Z>
Do you think I mean that was striking uh the <,> extend the the
try the bread reaction and Legco to the budget with <,> you and the liberals
<?> were </?> finding yourself uh speaking almost the same language for once
there

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X162:1:Z>
Do you think uh anything will change <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X163:1:Z>
Or is it is this budget is that set and that  ' s it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-046#164:1:A>
Well <,> my wish is something will change <{1> <[1> uh but
<,> the </[1> the the sixteen will <{2> <[2> vote </[2> on it

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#165:1:A>
<{3> <[3> On </[3> the ninth and the tenth we will debate <{4>
<[4> on </[4> so everyone will will be talking about about the the budget
<{5> <[5> and it </[5> welfare part

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#166:1:A>
But I <,> but what I  ' ve been trying to persuade the other Legco
members <,> uh from Liberal Party from the other other the the Left and the
Right <,> is that there  ' s not enough just to talk about it <{6> <[6> just
</[6> to say you are not pleased you are not happy with it

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#167:1:A>
You got to do something

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#168:1:A>
<{7> <[7> Because </[7> well that we we have uh a executive lack
government and we have to convince them we have to do something rather than
just saying <,> for the past few years already we  ' ve been talking about
increasing the CSSA standard rate for the elderly <{8> <[8> <,> </[8> and uh
that was starting from nineteen ninety four we almost <?> setting enormous
</?> view about how much we should rise

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#169:1:A>
<{9> <[9> And </[9> yet up to today three years later we still
taking about

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#170:1:A>
That is we are not happy with it but <?> we  ' re </?> not doing
anything

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X171:1:Z>
<[1> What  ' s it command comes up <unc> two-words </unc>
the </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X172:1:Z>
<[2> Sixteen </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X173:1:Z>
<[3> Yes </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X174:1:Z>
<[4> Debate yes </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X175:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X176:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X177:1:Z>
<[7> Uhm </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X178:1:Z>
<[8> Uhm </[8> </{8>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X179:1:Z>
<[9> Uhm </[9> </{9>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X180:1:Z>
So what can be done </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-046#181:1:A>
Well you have to <,> use some sort of threat <{1> <[1> like
uh </[1> you you will vote down the <{2> <[2> budget </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X182:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X183:1:Z>
<[2> Is that </[2> </{2> you vote down the budget is the whole
you try to amend parts of it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-046#184:1:A>
Yeah this this  ' s a option this  ' s a <{1> <[1> option the <?>
men </?> </[1> well amending part of it is basically symbolic rather <{2>
<[2> than </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X185:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X186:1:Z>
<[2> Well </[2> </{2> unless you get what you want </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-046#187:1:A>
Yes and that  ' s we  ' ve got what we want uh voting down the
budget is the same thing

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#188:1:A>
<{1> <[1> We </[1> know that uh the <.> gov </.> this particular
transitional <?> govern </?> is only uh three three three <,> three months to
go <{2> <[2> uh </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#189:1:A>
And and uh even we vote down the budget it won't stop <{3> <[3> it
still </[3> have the emergency money <{4> <[4> to </[4> to to go around play
with until until the the first of July

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#190:1:A>
But but that is a very important symbolic meaning we have to tell
the government of how determine we are in asking for a reasonable increase

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X191:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X192:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X193:1:Z>
<[3> Yeah </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X194:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X195:1:Z>
This is Jonathan Fenby talking to Law Chi Kwong on Radio Three
this Saturday morning

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X196:1:Z>
If you were <,> suddenly you woke up tomorrow morning and you
were the Financial Secretary <{> <[> <,> </[> what was the first two or three
things you do </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-046#197:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#198:1:A>
Ha ha that  ' s a very difficult question because I never dream of
that <&>

<$A> laughs </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X199:1:Z>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X200:1:Z>
But I ask you because <unc> one-word </unc> people
criticize legislators criticize the executive and say should do this should
do that but if you actually in their shoes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-046#201:1:A>
Oh definitely I would I would immediately increase three
hundred dollars for the elderly per month <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> which only
increase the spending by point one five percent <{2> <[2> which </[2> is a
very small which is small

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#202:1:A>
It  ' s only one ten percent of the error <{3> <[3> that </[3> every
year the government make on spending <{4> <[4> <,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#203:1:A>
So so I would do that that in in uh definitely

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#204:1:A>
The second thing I would do I I will <,> uh uh definitely review
the whole tax system

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#205:1:A>
I think that is a more uh more important issue

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#206:1:A>
Uh I I do not think the current tax system is fair and uh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X207:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X208:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X209:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X210:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X211:1:Z>
Or would you like uh <?> graduate </?> tax <{> <[> <,> because
the tax system more <,> or different company tax </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-046#212:1:A>
<[> Uh uh more a more graduate and more <?> grad </?> uhm uhm
</[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#213:1:A>
Not to to progressive but but <{1> <[1> now </[1> I  ' ll consider
it  ' s slightly regressive at the upper end <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#214:1:A>
Uhm people who earning uh five uh fifteen thousand per year per
month I  ' m I  ' m sorry <{3> <[3> fifteen thousand </[3> per per month and
someone who earn uh two hundred thousand <,> per month <{4> <[4> is </[4> uh
pay the same rate

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#215:1:A>
<{5> <[5> And </[5> I I I I think there should be a slight
difference <{6> <[6> there </[6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#216:1:A>
I  ' m not talking a big difference but I I <{7> <[7> do consider
</[7> it  ' s a slight difference

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#217:1:A>
<{8> <[8> And </[8> uh some element of improvement here in the
income tax should be should be there

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#218:1:A>
And I also in in the in the profit tax the the problem right now
we we have is we we have uh uh uh uh the the profit tax slightly higher than
the average rate <{9> <[9> the </[9> standard rate for for the <{10> <[10>
income tax </[10> so there  ' s incentive for people in the upper end try to
shift the the the tax burden <{11> <[11> in </[11> order reduce the tax

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#219:1:A>
I think there should be some some changes over there

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X220:1:Z>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-046#X221:1:Z>
