<ICE-HK:S2A-043#1:1:A>
The the topic itself is on housing strategies for temporary
workers in Guangzhou <,> which is a <,,> project which we conduct two years
ago <,> uh for a grant from this university in conjunction with uh colleagues
from Baptist University and Chungsaan University

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#2:1:A>
Uh what we are interested in primarily is to look into the <,>
spatial distribution of the temporary workers <,> uh in Guangzhou <,> and
then uh try to look into the uh policy response from the municipal
authorities <,> with regards to <,> this uh ever-increasing group of uh
people dwelling in the city itself

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#3:1:A>
But uh <,> as we move along you  ' ll probably realize that <,> I <,>
not only focusing on the empirical <,> investigation into the distribution
into the background of the temporary workers <,> but more important I also
try to throw some <,> theoretical construct around the issue itself <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#4:1:A>
So the <,> menu for this afternoon if I may put it this way <,> is
to look into initially about these uh <,> different perspectives in terms of
uh economic development <,> uh and its relations with migration <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#5:1:A>
And then I  ' m going to report a bit on the survey that we have
conduct uh towards the end of nineteen ninety-nine and then early year two
thousand <,> with regards to the temporary workers <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#6:1:A>
And then I will look into these uh so-called dualities of the
housing production system <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#7:1:A>
And then apologies to <,> <?> Manuel Castell </?> I <.> con </.> use
his term and twist a little bit by talking about this <,> the space of flow
and places <,> which are the maxim of this uh so-called postmodernist uh
investigation

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#8:1:A>
And to look into this uh global local housing <.> prod </.>
production dynamics to conclude <,> which hopefully will <,> have some <,> uh
<?> rejoinder </?> towards the initial discussions about the theoretical
construct <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#9:1:A>
On the notion of uh this development and migration <,> obviously <,>
uh there are quite a lot of uh theoretical <,> uh perspective that is
introduced <,> likely to come up <,,> in in the literature

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#10:1:A>
Very briefly we probably start with <,> uh the so-call classical
model of the uh <unc> one word </unc> stages of economic growth and
development which I  ' m sure you know people around the room are quite well
versed with <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#11:1:A>
And as we move along we <,> look into this <,> uh so-call
neoclassical dynamics by <,> uh <unc> name </unc> for instance <,> in
his work looking into economic development <,> and the <,> uh supply of
service labour <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#12:1:A>
All these <?> constructs would be </?> a more or less a well
defined framework <,> uh of <,> demand and supply of the uh interactive
efforts of uh economics <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#13:1:A>
Uh as we move along and then as the literature of uh the studies
gradually informed <,> the notion of migration begins to come into the
picture <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#14:1:A>
There is no longer a static model <,> as has been presented earlier
on <,> but then the dynamics between various bosses and various actors in the
old process of uh movement of <.> mobi </.> mobility of the people begins to
come to the uh <,,> brand of uh investigation

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#15:1:A>
So <,> say for instance we have this uh model for uh migration <,>
in terms of this rural and urban dynamics <,> uh and <,> of course you know a
very classical <,> uh model introduce by <?> Dudaro </?> which <,> almost
appears to be a standard text for students of economics around the eighties
<,> uh in terms of this uh <,> urban and rural migration <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#16:1:A>
Then <,> set the scene or set the backdrop in terms of the
development <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#17:1:A>
And then uh <,> starting from the seventies <,> increasing
literature in particular those sponsored by the World Bank and uh <,> the IMF
<,> Multi National Corporations and the like <,> begins to look into the
issue say for instance like urban buyers <,> so a classic from uh emerging
from those period <,> that  ' s a <,> work by <?> Michael Luctent </?> entitle
why people stay poor

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#18:1:A>
The <,> study of these urban buyers in the world in world
development <,> which again you know is is a very important <,> uh study <,>
focusing on on the development in particular in India

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#19:1:A>
Why is it the case that despite the continuous effort in terms of
<,,> uh economic development that <,,> significant amount of people within
the Indian subcontinent is not able to uh <,> move away their vicious cycle
so to speak of uh downward spiral in terms of uh development <,> class system
one of the issues that has been highlighted <,> and other related to them
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#20:1:A>
As we move away from this uh classical and neoclassical tradition
into this uh modernist tradition <,> we begins to look into not purely the
<,> model <,> in terms of uh economic development or migration but we are
also interested to look into the process of the changes and transformation

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#21:1:A>
Among other literatures we have uh <?> Suzanne Sasan </?> uh talk
about this uh <unc> 1-word </unc> cities published in nineteen
ninety-one <,> uh which focusing on the mobility as well as the agglomeration
of the mobility of labour <,> with particular reference to the market
formation

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#22:1:A>
And then more recently the trilogy by <?> Manuel Castell </?> <,>
the rise of the network society in information society and then the end of
the millennium <,> uh the the power of their identity <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#23:1:A>
Uh this trilogy is extremely influential

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#24:1:A>
And then uh last but not the least we have uh towards the latter
parts of the last millennium we have work by uh Peter Dicken <,> uh entitle
Global Shift which now move into his uh fourth edition

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#25:1:A>
I think he <?> make </?> a good fortune out of this <,> uh standard
text uh <,> <.> whi </.> which is extremely important in <,> informing our
understanding <,> of uh the dynamics between economic development and then of
uh population mobility <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#26:1:A>
Another stream of uh investigation which is gaining currency <,> in
the last uh <,> twenty years obviously in North America <,> and more recently
in this part of the world <,> is to look into this so-call participatory
perspective

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#27:1:A>
Now here I try to <,> highlight some of the <,> issues in terms of
participation which affect and influencing the process of uh development

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#28:1:A>
Uh we we have in this case uh as early as nineteen fifty-eight <,>
uh the Washington Square in New York City basically tried to <,> demonstrate
the participation or the involvement of the people

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#29:1:A>
I I think back then we don't have the <.> issu </.> the the notion
of stake holders but the people <,> which stood together to against uh the
construction of the boulevard across the Washington Square and then they
succeeded in doing so

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#30:1:A>
Uh moving into the eighties we have the work by Newsmith for
instance <,> looking into the issues of uh urban renewal or subsequently that  ' s
<,> uh be uh very uh at so uh uh uh uh catchphrase terms as a gentrification

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#31:1:A>
So the issues here look into the Philadelphia <,> uh development of
society hill <,> where people argued that it  ' s basically an effort of <,> a
concerted effort uh to move <,> the lower class people from the city centre
<,> where by places being <?> deemed </?> regard to have very strong
potential values of development <,> that there is one of this uh classic
example <.> we </.> well reported in the work by Newsmith again

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#32:1:A>
There are other campaign and activities like the <?> Tilo </?> this
is uh <,> this land is ours <,> looking into the uh collective effort by
people <,> in the borough of Wandsworth which is the south bank of London <,>
uh in nineteen ninety-nine <,> against the decision of uh the development by
Guinness corporation <.> whi </.> which is a a brewery from uh Ireland <,> in
in terms of the the development

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#33:1:A>
We also have uh the Nimby situation

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#34:1:A>
<.> Thi </.> this is not <,> the first time Nimby crop up in the
literature the so-call not in my backyard <,> uh syndrome

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#35:1:A>
But more recently we have this uh Donald Trump who tried to build a
<,> commercial residential <unc> one word </unc> uh <,,> architecture
<unc> one word </unc> argue <,> on the first avenue of uh Manhattan
<,> which again receive tremendous uh uh <,,> petition against the
development <,> but unfortunately uh the they they fail to uh win the game
and and then I think uh the construction is now ongoing this uh eight eight
ninety stories eight hundred foot uh tall <,,> building will <.> pro </.>
probably be in another three years  '  time <,> <?> still </?> side by side
will be United Nations uh headquarters uh along the first avenue <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#36:1:A>
The <,> the other issue is uh uh I  ' m sure you know <,> other thing
can <unc> 1-word </unc> me on on on on the pronunciation of this <,>
which basically is is is is a uh medieval practice of uh collecting essay
from the students

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#37:1:A>
So so so that the person or uh uh uh <,,> messenger perhaps you
know will move around and collect essays uh for for for particular uh topic
<,> so uh <unc> few words </unc> <O> speech-by-audience-member </O>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#38:1:A>
Thanks

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#39:1:A>
That that that  ' s exactly

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#40:1:A>
I I  ' m sure you know when you introduce this uh for the premier
exercises you have in the for for for the year one students <O> laughs </O>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#41:1:A>
But so <,> in in in effect it is a brain storming <unc>
several-words </unc> <,> uh in terms of uh the development process

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#42:1:A>
So <,> we we are <.> m </.> moving from the conventional wisdom
that uh things can be engineered within a laboratory or within an office <,>
to a situations which investigate into the process <,> uh as most of these
postmodernist works are focusing on <,> and then uh at the same time in
conjunction to this development about this participation <,> so so so that
the stake holders <,> the citizens <.> in </.> are involve <,> in in in in in
the ideas and shaping <,> the things to come <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#43:1:A>
We talk about participatory <,> naturally you know <,> we we have
this dialectic and then uh dialectical process there is also this
anti-participatory uh perspective

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#44:1:A>
Uh like for instance uh the <unc> several-words </unc>
episode of nineteen ninety-one again you know in <,> contrast with the uh
<unc> one word </unc> success of the society hill  ' s experience <,>
uh this this is a failure where the forces of the law <,> uh the the police
has <?> are being </?> drag in to uh evacuate <,> uh people who occupy again
you know a plant site in rural cities which deemed to have potential for
development

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#45:1:A>
Again in uh work by Newsmith uh also comment on this leading to uh
the ideas about re-gentrification or de-gentrifications

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#46:1:A>
The other one is uh the slap <,> which <,> uh is acronym for the
strategic lawsuit against public participation <,,> uh <.> whi </.> which is
in in effect uh the response to the uh Wandsworth episode I mention a moment
ago <,> in in terms of the uh Guinness uh <,,> uh corporation in terms of the
development in London

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#47:1:A>
It it is trying to issue the lawsuit by the authority <,> to uh
forbidden <,> various kind of <.> part </.> participation which may <,> deem
to be uh an extent in the ways of uh the development <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#48:1:A>
Then of course you know we have <unc> three words </unc>
talk about this uh <,> uh ideas about development from above and below <,>
which is a top down and then a bottom up uh interpretations

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#49:1:A>
Well all all all all these are very very brief uh <,> survey of uh
relevant studies or or discussion in terms of the development in <.> foc </.>
uh in particular reference to migratory <,> uh issues

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#50:1:A>
In in the case of China <,> I <,,> will say you know until very
recently the last ten fifteen years increasing <,> uh Chinese colleagues or
ethnic Chinese colleagues are working <,> uh research work in China <,> uh
which is enabling a a very very <,> healthy uh development in terms of the
the literature

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#51:1:A>
Uh in essence we are talking about a cyclical movement or uh argue
this uh circuit of the consumption production and market-oriented uh urban
development strategies <,> from the early days of the socialist development
<,> try to transform <,> cities <,> of <,> consumptive <.> lit </.> nature
into productive cities

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#52:1:A>
And and then uh <,> in the post-Marx development in the <?> Chinese
</?> area <,> uh we try to look into this uh market element <.> in </.> into
the uh development <,> uh process within the urban domain

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#53:1:A>
So early works by uh <?> Laurie Meyer </?> and Alan Noble <,>
<unc> name </unc> Christopher Howe <,> demonstrate the work uh <.>
tho </.> majority of those are from uh North America <.> al </.> although
Christopher Howe is from uh SOAS London

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#54:1:A>
And then more recently as I argue work by Kam Ming Chen <,> uh
Deborah Davis <,> uh <unc> name </unc> <,> uh Cindy Fin <,> George
<,> uh uh Professor <?> Yeah </?> <foreign> and Woo Fu Lung </foreign> and
and Andrew Walter <,> all contribute to <,> uh enhance our understanding in
terms of the <,> uh urban research in China <,> and <,> one way or the other
they are related uh to the uh notion of uh <,,> population dynamics in terms
of uh land use or changes

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#55:1:A>
So then that is the so so-call the theoretical construct or the
intellectual backdrop leading to the <,> uh investigations

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#56:1:A>
Now what what is a village in cities <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#57:1:A>
We we are aware of this uh the increasing floating population
moving into this uh big metropolis in in in in in China <,> <.> whi </.>
which is just a very natural process <,> which has be uh prophesied by many
you know in particular in the classical as well as in uh neoclassical
economic models <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#58:1:A>
What what I  ' m interested in is to look into the enclaves <,> which
is located <,> within the urban domain itself <,,> but <,> at the same time
within this uh so-call rural administrative structure <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#59:1:A>
Which puts <,> in both in terms of the land use <.> struc </.>
system as well as the development potential <,> in a very very <?>
predicament </?> situations <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#60:1:A>
As of year two thousand there are <,> uh one hundred and
thirty-nine of these enclaves <,> identified uh in within the <?> remit </?>
of uh Guangzhou city itself

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#61:1:A>
In particular <,> uh located in area like uh Tianhe Haizu and
Baiyun districts <,> which formerly is being regarded as the uh rural <,>
county district and <.> s </.> <,> due to administrative transformation and
<unc> one word </unc> of uh the city boundary has been incorporated
into as a so-call core area of a the city itself <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#62:1:A>
The <,> temporary population in Guangzhou has increased
significantly from nought point <,> nought point three million <,> uh in the
early days of the open policy <,> to one point seven million as of uh
nineteen ninety-seven <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#63:1:A>
Uh so the latter figures demonstrate a temporary population ratio
to the permanent population ratio of forty-three to one thousand

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#64:1:A>
Now I <,> I I I I  ' m sure you know colleagues around the room will
agree to the fact that it will be extremely difficult to say what exactly are
the amount of uh floating populations uh we we have in any particular cities
in China

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#65:1:A>
Uh the figures we have here we quote from the statistical year
books uh from China <,> as of some of the <,> uh subsequent data <,> which
will be <,> <.> whi </.> which which we are going to uh visit <,> uh all
relied on those data

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#66:1:A>
So uh I I welcome discussions <.> a </.> about the reliability of
this you know but for the time being <,> we will just uh take <,> uh the
official data uh as granted <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#67:1:A>
Well that is the backdrop we kick off with the survey <,> uh
initially with archive research in terms of the theoretical construct <,> and
then we drum up a questionnaire design <,> uh we have a pilot test uh and
then we launch a more massive uh more large scale uh questionnaires uh survey
up to uh four hundred <,> plus

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#68:1:A>
And then uh of that uh questionnaire return we  ' re going to have
about <,> uh hundred in that for case studies

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#69:1:A>
We have face to face interviews and discussion with the people <,>
uh hope <,> with a will to bring in more information about this uh village in
the city

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#70:1:A>
So before I move onto report on the findings, I <,> would just like
to mention that <,,> what we are <.> tal </.> going to talk about is not <,,>
a full representation of the floating population that have uh has been
identified in uh Guangzhou towards the end of uh the last millennium

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#71:1:A>
What I  ' m interested in <,> uh in this research is to look into the
people <,> who dwell in this so-call <,> uh village in the cities <,> this
enclave within the main urban area

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#72:1:A>
All right so the <,> figures <,,> probably we are talking about
close <,> to one million people <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#73:1:A>
Right <,> so this is a <,,> map <,,> showing the <,> spatial
expansion of uh the Guangzhou city itself

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#74:1:A>
Uh <,> it doesn't stand out quite well from from the map but uh
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-043#75:1:A>
In in brief we are talking about this uh city centre <,> and then
<.> o </.> over the years with gradual expansion <,> towards the lower <?>
ridge </?> of the uh Pearl River to the East <,> and and then uh more
recently uh to the North across the Baiyuen <,> uh mountain range <,> and
then to the South across the river <,> to this uh Haiju and Fongjun area </I>
