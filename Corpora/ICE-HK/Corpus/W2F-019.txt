<h> MONDAY , JUNE 30TH , 1997 </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#2:1>
<bold> NOON </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#3:1>
You don't stand when you travel on the subway in Hong Kong at rush
hour .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#4:1>
Nor do you sit .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#5:1>
You sort of hover , your body held suspended in the unconscious but
unshakeable grip of the colony  ' s worker ants .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#6:1>
This thought flashed briefly through Davis Lee  ' s mind as he wrapped
his leg as tightly as he could around the steel pole in the middle of the
carriage and ground his teeth together. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#7:1>
For the lighter traveller , subway journeys are a risky business .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#8:1>
Stories of wedged passengers being helplessly carried off packed
trains at the wrong station are legend . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#9:1>
The train shimmered into Admiralty station and came to a gradual
halt , which it announced with a relieved hiss .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#10:1>
He gripped the pole more firmly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#11:1>
The doors trilled an e-flat and flung themselves open , triggering
anxious tremors in the glove of commuters which held him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#12:1>
It seemed as if several thousand people got out of the carriage , but
magically , there appeared to be as many still in it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#13:1>
 ' <indig> Cheng sui-sam che mun </indig> .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#14:1>
Please stand clear of the train door , &rdquo; said a recorded female
voice with exaggeratedly precise articulation .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#15:1>
The hum changed pitch , became a staccato squeal , and the doors
sighed shut .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#16:1>
The tube of human bodies , lightly wrapped in their thin metal jacket
, lurched forwards again. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#17:1>
Thank goodness Chinese people don't smell , though Davis ,
recalling the more horrific rush-hour trips during his lengthy sojourns
abroad .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#18:1>
He shut his eyes , lowered his shoulders and let himself relax
against the warm fabric wall clutching him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#19:1>
So many people .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#20:1>
And this wasn't even the real rush hour .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#21:1>
This was merely the cross-harbour pre-lunch surge , intensified by
today  ' s unusual holiday arrangements. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#22:1>
He had learned early in his commuting days that it was impossible
to read on the rightly named Mass transit Railway .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#23:1>
The first time he had taken a paperback with him - a book chosen for
its slimness - he had held it 12 inches away from his face to allow his
36-year-old eyes to focus on it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#24:1>
The distance proved too great .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#25:1>
He and the book had been swiftly and unwittingly parted at a busy
station. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#26:1>
The train moved almost imperceptibly to the right , and then left .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#27:1>
To keep some semblance of balance , he planted his feet as far apart
as he could , which was about eight inches , and swayed slightly as the
cylinder flew along its gently curved path through the rock. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#28:1>
The recorded voice spoke again:  '  <indig> Dai yaht jaaam hai Jung
Wan </indig> .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#29:1>
The next station is Central. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#30:1>
Davis had taken to passing his travelling time with a mental
exercise focusing on the clothes that were pressed into his face .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#31:1>
This involved delving into his memory to the two years straight after
his American MBA , which he had spent in a Johor Baru garment factory .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#32:1>
A 65/35 polyester-cotton mix had his or her elbow deep into his
kidney .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#33:1>
A musty-smelling mohair suits in light charcoal kept leaning back
into the left side of his face. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#34:1>
Five years overseas meant he was seeing Hong Kong from the
viewpoint of an outsider , reminding him of his first arrival in the fabled
city-state , as a wide-eyed eight-year-old from Xinjuang who felt as if he
had touched down on another planet. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#35:1>
Once more the train came to a careful halt and the doors sprang
open .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#36:1>
This time Davis moved slowly towards them , trying to anticipate the
moves of the passengers between him and the outside . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#37:1>
Suddenly someone yanked him backwards by his right wrist .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#38:1>
He caught his breath .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#39:1>
He tugged sharply .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#40:1>
There was a yelp of pain and surprise. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#41:1>
'What - let me go.'

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#42:1>
This was a Western female voice nearby. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#43:1>
Davis peered through the moving bodies to try to see who was
holding his wrist - and apparently someone else  ' s - so tightly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#44:1>
He caught a brief glimpse of a struggling woman about 30 inches - or
two bodies - away from him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#45:1>
Someone else in trouble .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#46:1>
What was going on? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#47:1>
Over the next few seconds , the people around him dissolved and
he looked down at his wrist .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#48:1>
He gasped .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#49:1>
 ' <indig> Mutyeh </indig> ?  '  A steel manacle encircled the bottom of
his palm .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#50:1>
There was a heavy chain leading from it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#51:1>
He realized it was half a pair of handcuffs , and the other rings was
on the other side of the steel pole , around the wrist of a <indig> gwaipor
</indig> , who was making sharp pulling motions .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#52:1>
He was shackled to her. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#53:1>
She looked up and their eyes met .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#54:1>
'Who are you ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#55:1>
Get this off .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#56:1>
Please .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#57:1>
There must be some mistake.'

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#58:1>
There was fear in her eyes , and he realized that she thought he had
deliberately snapped the bracelet onto her arm. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#59:1>
'It  ' s not mine, ' he said , looking for a catch or a button or a
clasp with which he could release himself .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#60:1>
There was none .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#61:1>
'I cannot get it off. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#62:1>
'Please. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#63:1>
'It  ' s not mine .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#64:1>
I do not have any key. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#65:1>
'Well , who has the key? ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#66:1>
'I don't know. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#67:1>
'Why are you doing this ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#68:1>
Get this off .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#69:1>
I have to get off at this stop .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#70:1>
Is this some sort of joke? ' Her voice swung from irritation to fear
and back again. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#71:1>
'It  ' s not me doing this - I don't know - I get off here , also ,
come on.'

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#72:1>
He slipped behind her side of the steel pole and the two of them
stepped off the train .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#73:1>
They stood there in silent bafflement for a moment .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#74:1>
The air-powered doors hissed noisily behind them .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#75:1>
'Is this some sort of trick? ' said the European woman , picking
ineffectually at the bracelets joining her left wrist to his right. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#76:1>
The situation was so sudden , so absurd , so ridiculous that
Davis did not know how to react .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#77:1>
 ' <indig> Jun hai </indig> - truly , I don't know how this happened .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#78:1>
Someone must have _'

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#79:1>
He scanned the station desperately to see if there was an answer on
the platform .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#80:1>
All he saw was a mother who had stopped to tie her toddler  ' s
shoelaces , a cluster of students talking to each other , and an old man
hobbling away before the next train spilled another flood of humanity onto
the platform .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#81:1>
 ' <indig> Aieeyah </indig> . ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#82:1>
'How did this happen? ' her voice was stern. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#83:1>
'I don't know .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#84:1>
I am telling the truth .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#85:1>
Someone must have ... while we were on train , someone must have ,
well , stuck them on us .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#86:1>
It just seems... so crazy... <indig> ji-seen </indig> . ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#87:1>
She looked him hard in the eye and he instinctively glanced down
at the handcuffs .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#88:1>
'You look really guilty, ' she said .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#89:1>
'Which probably means you  ' re telling the truth .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#90:1>
It must be some sort of practical joke .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#91:1>
Although what the point is... and who.. ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#92:1>
Who would lock two strangers together ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#93:1>
Why? ' She also started looking around her , for an answer which did
not seem to exist .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#94:1>
'How do we get out from these? ' said Davis .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#95:1>
'I have very important appointment...'

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#96:1>
He continued to scan the platform , looking for - what ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#97:1>
He spotted the emergency phone on the wall .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#98:1>
'Let us call the <indig> ging-chaat </indig> , the police , the
guards .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#99:1>
This... is very strange. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#100:1>
He strode towards the wall , and she careful kept pace with him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#101:1>
A young hard voice spoke from behind them .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#102:1>
'Er... hold it right there , guys .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#103:1>
We want to talk to you .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#104:1>
Hang on .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#105:1>
Mr Lee? ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#106:1>
It took a second for Davis to register that they were being
spoken to .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#107:1>
He turned of see the group of students was approaching .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#108:1>
The speaker was a thin-limbed male of indeterminate race with messy
, pepper-and-salt hair .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#109:1>
David spoke angrily. <indig>

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#110:1>
'Hai mee-yeh see ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#111:1>
Lei wan been-goh ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#112:1>
Ngaw yihga mm duk haan , ho mong .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#113:1>
Nei sing mee yeh </indig> ?  ' 

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#114:1>
He noticed the youth was Eurasian and switched to English .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#115:1>
'Did you put this on to us ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#116:1>
Take it off , please .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#117:1>
Who do you want ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#118:1>
Who are you ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#119:1>
I am very busy. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#120:1>
The grey-haired student smiled: a knowing , dangerously bright
smile in an unexpectedly young face .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#121:1>
Under the old head of hair , he had the unwrinkled eyes of a boy in
his late teens , maybe 20 .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#122:1>
'There has been no mistake , Mr Lee .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#123:1>
Could you come with us for a moment ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#124:1>
I  ' ll explain.'

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#125:1>
Behind the young man , he saw several youths , grinning , their
faces excited .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#126:1>
A prank of some sort ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#127:1>
A case of mistaken identity ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#128:1>
 ' <indig> Mee-yeh wa ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#129:1>
Ngoh mm mingbaak </indig> . ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#130:1>
The student turned to the Western woman .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#131:1>
'Sorry about the inconvenience , Ms Manley .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#132:1>
Just come with us , and we  ' ll explain .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#133:1>
Please .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#134:1>
Just come this way.'

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#135:1>
He seemed to notice the fear in her face .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#136:1>
One of his hands hovered near her shoulder , wanting to give it a
reassuring touch , but was unable to land .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#137:1>
'You  ' re in no danger .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#138:1>
Please. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#139:1>
Her expression changed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#140:1>
Davis could see that she had decided that these were not lunatics ,
but apparently normal people - people who knew her name .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#141:1>
Her pale eyes narrowed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#142:1>
'Do I have a choice ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#143:1>
I like to have a choice in these things , I  ' m extremely busy , you
know .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#144:1>
Is this some kind of joke ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#145:1>
Are you students ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#146:1>
Look , I like a joke as much as the next person , but not today .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#147:1>
Take this things off me , please. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#148:1>
'Just come with us and I  ' ll explain .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#149:1>
Please .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#150:1>
It  ' s for a good cause .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#151:1>
The best cause in the world .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#152:1>
Please?'

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#153:1>
There was a hard insistent edge under the young man  ' s friendly
words . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#154:1>
<indig>  ' Ngoh mm duk-haan, </indig>  '  interrupted Davis .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#155:1>
'I am not free .

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#156:1>
I cannot .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#157:1>
I am meeting someone .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#158:1>
Meeting someone upstairs at 12 o'clock, ' he said , his quiet voice
sounding calm in contrast with that of his agitated fellow prisoner. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#159:1>
'So am I , &rdquo; said Ms Manley. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#160:1>
'No you  ' re not , &rdquo; said the young man , unable to prevent
a flash of glee .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#161:1>
'You were both told to meet Mr Edgar Benitez-Ropes in the main
concourse of Central station at 12 noon , right ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#162:1>
Well here I am - I  ' m Edgar Benitez-Ropes , and I  ' m delighted to
meet you.'

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#163:1>
He flashed his too-bright smile at them once more .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#164:1>
'But there is another person - another friend I said I would meet
there too, ' said Davis. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#165:1>
Edgar looked him suspiciously in the eye .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#166:1>
'Oh , really ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#167:1>
Well , it  ' s - uh - 12.04 now .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#168:1>
Come on .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#169:1>
We  ' re going upstairs , so we can pick up your other friend on the
way , if he  ' s there. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#170:1>
The group moved to the escalator and were carried upstairs as a
sudden gale filled the tunnel .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#171:1>
The dragon-roar of the next train arriving filled the tunnels below
them .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#172:1>
One of the students was a Caucasian girl who had wisps of blonde and
brass-coloured hair sticking out of a head-scarf .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#173:1>
Next to her stood a very tall , worried-looking youth with bad acne.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#174:1>
'Who are you supposedly meeting? ' said Edgar , clearly remaining
sceptical as he stood on the step above Davis. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#175:1>
He paused before answering .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#176:1>
How to react ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#177:1>
Would it not be indiscreet to pass Yuan Chi-hua'a name on to these
people ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#178:1>
Who were they ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#179:1>
But perhaps he should tell them , he thought .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#180:1>
Maybe the fact that he had a very busy schedule would be an excuse
to extract himself from this game , or joke , or publicity stunt or whatever
it was .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#181:1>
'I  ' m meeting someone very important. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#182:1>
The agitated <indig> gwaipor </indig> - what did he say her name
was ? - suddenly interrupted .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#183:1>
'How did you do this? ' </p> Edgar turned to her , his face beaming
with pride .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#184:1>
'We  ' ve had people following you both for the past hour .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#185:1>
We planned to clip you together upstairs when we all met , but I had
been hoping we would have an opportunity to do it earlier.'

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#186:1>
His smile burst into a laugh .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#187:1>
'Ha .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#188:1>
Forcing you two together in the crowd was surprisingly easy .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#189:1>
Getting the handcuffs onto you without you even noticing - well ,
that was my own special contribution.'

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#190:1>
The students behind them sniggered guiltily , two girls with their
hands clapped over their mouths. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#191:1>
The group reached the top of the escalator and laboriously
exited through the narrow ticket barriers .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#192:1>
Davis and the woman had trouble , since the turnstiles were designed
to be used by one person at a time , using their right hands to feed the
ticket into the slot. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#193:1>
'Where are you meeting your friend? ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#194:1>
'There, ' said Davis , spotting Yuan out of the corner of his
eye. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#195:1>
The old man , who was wearing an obviously expensive Italian
suit and garish rings on all fingers , strode up to them .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#196:1>
A cloud of Aramis suddenly enveloped the group .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#197:1>
He said in a Singaporean accent;  ' Hey !

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#198:1>
Davis .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#199:1>
How are you ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#200:1>
Good to see you .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#201:1>
These friends of yours , is it ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#202:1>
You  ' re looking.... ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#203:1>
His voice trailed off as he shook his friend  ' s hand and noticed
that it was handcuffed to the left wrist of the woman next to him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#204:1>
'Hmm, ' he said , two vertical lines appearing between his eyebrows .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#205:1>
'We have an interesting situation here , is it? ' </p>

<p>

'I won't ask you to shake my hand, ' said the woman , icily .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#207:1>
Since you have just done so. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#208:1>
The Singaporean looked quizzically at Davis , as if to ask what
was going on .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#209:1>
'So just who has arrested who? ' he asked with a rather uncertain
trace of a laugh in his voice. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#210:1>
'Please, ' said Edgar .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#211:1>
'Could all of you please follow me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#212:1>
And you , Mr...? ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#213:1>
'Yuan Chi-hua. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#214:1>
 ' ...Mr Yuan .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#215:1>
All of you .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#216:1>
Please.'

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#217:1>
Edgar beckoned them like a unconfident fireman trying to entice a
cat from a treetop. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#218:1>
Yuan looked uncertainly at the young man with the bird  ' s nest
hair , but as the group began to move , he fell into step a few yards behind
his friend. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#219:1>
'Sorry, ' said David , giving his friend a weak smile .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#220:1>
'This will only take few minutes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#221:1>
Very sorry .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#222:1>
Nice to see you.'

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#223:1>
He thought it would be hard to move while shackled to another person
, but here it made little difference. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#224:1>
Walking through the Central subway station on a busy day was a
slow , stop-start business anyway .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#225:1>
There were so many exits , stairs , shops , escalators moving
upwards and downwards , that the strings of people heading in each direction
constantly broke each other up , like an ill-rehearsed folk dance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-019#226:1>
The party got to the surface without any major problems , and
were led towards World-Wide House .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#227:1>
The outside air was furnace-hot , and Davis almost immediately felt
a trickle of sweat run down his collar .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#228:1>
Yet he was surprised by how calm he was , how easily he has accepted
what was , after all , a distinctly unusual situation .

<ICE-HK:W2F-019#229:1>
Perhaps it was the fact that life felt so disjointed at the moment
for - well , for so many other reasons . </p>
