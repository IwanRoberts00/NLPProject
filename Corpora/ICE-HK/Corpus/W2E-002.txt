<bold> Futile gamble </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#2:1>
After deciding not to press ahead with moves to legalise soccer
betting for the time being , the Government has revived its bid to push
through a bill that targets overseas bookmakers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#3:1>
The Gambling &obrack;  Amendment &cbrack; Bill 2000 , if passed , will make
bookmaking an offence , regardless of whether it is conducted here or from
outside Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#4:1>
What is ironic , as officials noted in their submission to the
legislature , is that &ldquo; the policy intention is that betting directly
with an overseas bookmaker is not illegal if the bookmaker does not in any
way conduct the bookmaking , offer betting-related services and promote its
business in Hong Kong" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#5:1>
There is a sense of futility in the Government  ' s expressed
intention .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#6:1>
It recognises the fact that it is well-nigh impossible to prosecute
individuals for placing bets on the Internet in the privacy of their home .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#7:1>
That is , unless police are prepared to knock down doors to check on
suspected gamblers - a most preposterous proposition . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#8:1>
And unless the overseas-based bookmakers clearly have a local
presence , no enforcement action can practically be taken against them . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#9:1>
Officials claim they are confident that once the bill is passed ,
betting with overseas bookmakers will decline because banks and credit card
centres will be stopped from processing betting-related transactions . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#10:1>
These financial intermediaries are not known to have protested
against the bill yet .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#11:1>
But can they be expected to know the real identities of account
holders who might be overseas bookmakers ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#12:1>
Presumably , the Government wants the bill passed before the
World Cup kicks off on May 31 , when illegal soccer gambling is expected to
surge . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#13:1>
For as long as Hong Kong maintains its policy of allowing betting
only on horse races organised by the Hong Kong Jockey Club and the Mark Six
lottery held by the Hong Kong Lotteries Board , officials have no choice but
to plug holes that have allowed betting revenue to go overseas . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#14:1>
But there is really no difference between betting on a horse race
and betting on a soccer match .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#15:1>
Nor should a distinction be made between betting with a local or
overseas bookmaker .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#16:1>
Trying to protect the revenue of local bookmakers is a dubious
argument for rooting out overseas betting syndicates because it amounts to a
restriction of trade . </p>

<h> <bold> Time for sincerity </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#18:2>
North Korea  ' s on-again , off-again attempts at dialogue with the
outside world have provoked as much hope as exasperation .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#19:2>
&ldquo; Sincere &rdquo; is a word rarely used by once-reclusive
leader Kim Jong-il and his diplomats , but it is hoped they now adopt it as
their catch-cry . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#20:2>
Too often , the North has pulled back at crucial times in
negotiations .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#21:2>
Whether by design or due to genuine misgivings , the tired pattern
has led to only scepticism by those involved . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#22:2>
Another door of optimism has been opened by Mr Kim  ' s acceptance
of an offer to reopen talks with the United States and his promise to visit
Seoul for talks with his South Korean counterpart , Kim Dae-jung .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#23:2>
Reunions of families split by the division of the Korean peninsula 50
years ago will resume . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#24:2>
There was similar optimism two years ago when talks in Pyongyang
between the Kims were announced . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#25:2>
The historic visit opened North Korea to the world and the
thought of reunification went from being an impossible dream to a possibility .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#26:2>
But within a year , those thoughts had turned to familiar
animosity and distrust .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#27:2>
US President George W . Bush  ' s January labelling of North Korea as
part of an &ldquo; axis of evil &rdquo; along with Iran and Iraq hammered in
the final nail . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#28:2>
South Korean presidential envoy Lim Dong-won last week breathed
new life into the process after three days of talks in Pyongyang .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#29:2>
He has convinced Kim Jong-il that nothing is to be gained from
maintaining an insular attitude . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#30:2>
Face-to-face talks are the only way that tensions on the
peninsula can be calmed or concerns about Pyongyang  ' s nuclear and missile
programmes can be dealt with . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#31:2>
But it is up to North Korea to remain engaged and not back off as
it has numerous times before .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#32:2>
If it truly wants to become a member of the world community , it must
show dedication . </p>

<bold> Party political crisis </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#34:3>
A poll that found 53 per cent of the public do not think any of
the SAR  ' s political parties can represent them should set the alarm bells
ringing for the parties .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#35:3>
What is so worrying about the figure is that it is the culmination of
a trend that clearly shows an increasing number of people have lost
confidence in them . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#36:3>
The Chinese University  ' s Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies has
been tracking public support of political parties for more than five years
now . When the first poll was conducted in 1996 , only 35.6 per cent could
not name a political party that could best represent their interests . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#37:3>
Under the Basic Law , political parties have a limited role to
play in running Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#38:3>
Barred from forming the Government , the best they can hope to
achieve is to win as many seats as possible in the legislature so they can
become a powerful opposition to the Government . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#39:3>
Yet although they do not govern , those legislators - and the
parties behind them - who are returned by popular elections can claim to be
representatives of the people .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#40:3>
Indeed , it is this electoral legitimacy which distinguishes them
from the Chief Executive , who is returned only by an 800-member Election
Committee and presides over an unelected administration . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#41:3>
Now the polls have called into question the notion that our
political parties can represent the popular will . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#42:3>
The pollsters warn that the political parties even face being
sidelined if the " ministers &rdquo; to be appointed by Chief Executive Tung
Chee-hwa in July under the new principal officials accountability system
succeed in wooing the public with their fresh image and shoring up support
for the Government . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#43:3>
It remains to be seen whether that will pose a danger to the
parties .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#44:3>
But an even bigger concern is that the ministers ' success , should it
become reality , may boost the argument that democracy is not all that
important after all . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#45:3>
History has shown that Hong Kong people are largely a compliant
lot .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#46:3>
They had no qualms in throwing their support behind unelected
colonial governors as long as the latter were seen to be doing and saying the
right thing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#47:3>
For the sake of their own survival and the further development of
democracy , it is time the political parties reflected on the reasons behind
their plunging popularity and tried better to articulate the public will .

<bold> Voices of caution </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#49:4>
Despite the rhetoric from the White House suggesting military
action to topple the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein , there are welcome signs
that the US , and its close ally Britain , are not planning precipitate
action . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#50:4>
British officials , who will most certainly be involved along
with their US counterparts in any military action , have let it be known that
any possible armed intervention is likely to be at least a year away .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#51:4>
In the meantime , both countries appear to have taken the sensible
option of trying to get UN weapons inspectors back into Iraq .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#52:4>
Saddam Hussein is without doubt one of the most unpleasant rulers in
the world today .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#53:4>
But this does not justify the United States and Britain taking the
law into their own hands and taking military action to topple him because the
leaders of these two countries do not like him . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#54:4>
The two countries have threatened military actions on the grounds
that Saddam has stockpiled weapons of mass destruction and is a threat to
world peace .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#55:4>
There seems little doubt that Iraq has chemical and probably
biological weapons .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#56:4>
But this is nothing new . Iraq has used chemical weapons such as
mustard gas against its own restive minorities , as well as during the
Iran-Iraq war more than two decades ago .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#57:4>
The West was at that time quite happy to court him and to use him as
a bulwark against a radical Iranian regime . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#58:4>
Why has he suddenly become a threat to peace in the region and
the world ?

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#59:4>
And if he were indeed such a threat , should not Iraq  ' s neighbours ,
most of whom have no love for the Iraqi leader , not be the first to clamour
for military action ?

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#60:4>
Instead , there is an overwhelming demand from the region that
Washington and London keep out .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#61:4>
Mr Bush and Mr Blair would do well to heed the voices of caution from
the Middle East . </p>

</I>

<I> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#62:5>
<bold> A growing burden </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#63:5>
Hong Kong does not have a properly funded pension scheme that
guarantees a basic standard of living for all retirees .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#64:5>
But the financially destitute can apply for help under the
Comprehensive Social Security Assistance scheme , and more than 100,000
senior citizens have done so . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#65:5>
Yet , out of a desire to maintain their dignity , many poor
elderly people are known to have opted not to apply for CSSA payments .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#66:5>
Instead , they choose to survive on odd jobs , supplementing their
income with the several hundred dollars they get under the Old Age Allowance
scheme - &dollar;625 a month for those aged 65 and &dollar;705 for those
above 70 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#67:5>
Many elderly citizens who do not qualify for CSSA because they
live with their families , but are not getting much pocket money from their
children , also find the allowance a precious source of income .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#68:5>
But the problem with the scheme is that it is largely
non-means-tested .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#69:5>
While recipients aged between 65 and 70 cannot have savings of more
than &dollar;150,000 , no such restrictions apply for those aged above 70 .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#70:5>
Last year , some 457,000 recipients of the allowance collected a
total of &dollar;3.56 billion - a financial burden on the Government that
will only grow as the elderly population increases .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#71:5>
Clearly , far too many elderly people who probably do not need the
allowance are getting it .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#72:5>
If we take the view that payments from the public coffers should only
go to the needy , then a strong case could be made for introducing a tougher
means test to weed out most of the recipients of the allowance so the money
saved could be spent elsewhere . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#73:5>
But since it was introduced some 30 years ago , the allowance has
come to be seen as a reward for senior citizens ' past contribution to the
community , and the public clearly want it to remain that way .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#74:5>
The challenge for the Government is to find the money to meet the
scheme  ' s ever-growing demand for cash , by pointing out there is no such
thing as a free lunch and that the allowance as it is can only be sustained
by higher taxes . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#75:6>
<bold> A question of trust </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#76:6>
The controversy over the environmental damage caused by
construction work for the Disney project at Penny  ' s Bay continues with the
confirmation by an independent expert that dredging and reclamation work was
responsible for the death of fish at two farms in the area . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#77:6>
Despite earlier government claims to the contrary , a report by
Daniel Chan Kwong-on of the University of Hong Kong has found that sediment
caused by dredging in Penny  ' s Bay did cause the death of at least several
tens of thousands of fish at the Ma Wan and Cheung Sha Wan fish farms . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#78:6>
The Government  ' s response to this report is not known yet but ,
since it commissioned the study , it is presumably bound to accept its
recommendation of compensation for the loss of fish stocks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#79:6>
In what has now become a familiar pattern , the Government
initially denied that the dredging work for the Disney site had anything to
do with the death of fish in the nearby farms .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#80:6>
Then , after a public outcry , it agreed to an independent
investigation , which proves that dredging has had an adverse impact . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#81:6>
In a similar vein , the extent of poisonous waste at the Cheoy
Lee shipyard was overlooked in the early planning stages , and now the public
is faced with a clean-up bill of up to &dollar;450 million .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#82:6>
It has also agreed to contact workers at the old shipyard to see if
they have been affected by the dioxin that lay buried there . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#83:6>
Few people dispute that the Disney project is good for Hong Kong
and will bring economic benefits to the territory .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#84:6>
But when such projects are planned , the Government should learn to
be more trusting and open with the public about the true costs that are
involved . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#85:13>
<bold> Laying out the changes </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#86:7>
After days of conflicting reports in the media , officials have
finally cleared the air by laying out the structure of the new accountability
system for principal officials . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#87:7>
A major surprise in the blueprint unveiled yesterday is that the
post of Secretary for Civil Service will be filled by a political appointee .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#88:7>
While the appointee must be from within the civil service , he or
she , once appointed , will cease to be a civil servant and be accountable to
the Chief Executive like other ministers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#89:7>
Previously , it was thought that the Secretary for Civil Service
would remain a civil servant so that he could look after the interests of the
civil service and protect its integrity . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#90:7>
The decision to make the bearer of this office a political
appointee is a recognition of the fact that any policy on the civil service
is by its very nature a political one .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#91:7>
Also , the implementation of the accountability system would not be
complete if the Secretary for Civil Service could not be removed for failing
to push through the Chief Executive  ' s agenda . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#92:7>
The system  ' s new command structure , which provides that all
the ministers be directly accountable to the Chief Executive , could prove
embarrassing for the Chief Secretary and the Financial Secretary .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#93:7>
Traditionally , each is in charge of a number of policy areas with
the bureau chiefs concerned reporting to the Chief Executive through them .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#94:7>
Although the new structure still recognises the seniority of the
Chief Secretary , Financial Secretary and Secretary for Justice , and the
three will continue to receive higher pay , their clout over other ministers
and whether they will be bypassed by the latter is expected to be dependent
on their personal relationship with the Chief Executive . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#95:7>
Changes are unsettling .

<ICE-HK:W2E-002#96:7>
It will take time for senior civil servants , particularly members
of the administrative service who form the backbone of the administration and
have been playing dual roles as both departmental administrators and
policy-makers , to get used to working under political appointees ,
particularly those from outside the civil service . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-002#97:7>
But the adaptation process will be helped by the fact that most
of Mr Tung Chee-hwa  ' s first batch of ministers are expected to be drawn
from among the existing policy secretaries who are civil servants . </p>
