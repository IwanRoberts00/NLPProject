<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#1:1:A>
So good morning everyone 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> Can you all hear me

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#2:1:A>
Well the <unc> 1-word </unc> that I  ' m going to talk about
is supervisor student relationship from a student perspective

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#3:1:A>
Well <,> uh in my sense uh the relationship is like uh research partners 

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> It should be for I think that uh the most part of the
research the implementation part the thinking part should be done by the
student and the uh supervisor act as a <.> guide </.> guardian beside me

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#4:1:A>
And uhm <,> so it is through this <.> int </.> interaction between the 
supervisor and the student that we work out uh a uh research

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#5:1:A>
And when I think back <,> in during the years that I did uh my
research here in The Hong Kong Polytechnic well I find that is particularly
for me frustrating during the very first stage of my research that is uh
between the first three to six months <,> uh when I started doing research

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#6:1:A>
Because at that period uh I don't really understand what I  ' m going
to do because of the lack of background of my research field

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#7:1:A>
So in this stage I have all the ups and downs and I even <?> challenge </?> myself
for many times thinking about whether I should do the research

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#8:1:A>
And when I sometimes talk with some of my uh research colleagues now
<,> especially those who are uh starting their research right away <,> they
told me that uh they thought that their supervisors expect them to do a lot
not expect them to do but <,> uh expect them to know a lot about the field 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> Well 
maybe they just think that only

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#9:1:A>
But uh I find that maybe there are some lack of communications
between uh the supervisors and the students especially uh in the first first
uh stage of the research

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#10:1:A>
When I look back I find out there are a lot of differences between
undergraduate studies and postgraduate studies

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#11:1:A>
Uh during the undergraduate studies I find that uh most of the
information are are <.> give </.> given to me what I require is to study them
hard 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> I don't have to do a lot of analysis just have to digest it and
then when I am doing assignments and examinations I <,> uh just uh uhm put
all these things that I  ' ve digested on paper and that  ' s it

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#12:1:A>
But when I  ' m doing research it involves critical thinking analysis
and so on and I think as a a student we need time to get uh uh accustomed to
that

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#13:1:A>
And there  ' s a much uh uh difference between this undergraduate and
postgraduate requirements that I find that during the first stage of research
I <,> find a bit difficult for me

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#14:1:A>
And I remember I once talked to my supervisor about that and what he
told me is well really very encouraging 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> He told me well for every research
student it is like that 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> For the very first stage we have difficulties and it  ' s
better for us to talk I think with our supervisors because I think that he should
he or she should have gone through this stage 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> And <,> well I think he he
they can help us

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#15:1:A>
And then the second part I would like to talk about is how often
should a student see the supervisors

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#16:1:A>
Well as all of the research students have supervisors so how <.>
oft </.> how often should we should we go to see them <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> Uh once a week or uh twice a week or once a month

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#17:1:A>
But I don't think there is an exact uh uh formula which uh gives you
some insight how often should we see but I do suggest that we should see our
supervisors regularly

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#18:1:A>
Well why do I mean that

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#19:1:A>
Because from my experience I know that if I have to see my
supervisor regularly it means that I have to push myself at least to give
some results for him to see

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#20:1:A>
It may be there are some there are a lot of flexibilities of doing
research here so flexibility may make with <,> uh for some sometimes uh too
much time so that we we will not uh concentrate much but by uh seeing our our
supervisors regularly for I think it can help

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#21:1:A>
And in our group as for example maybe because of uh there are quite
a large number of research students in my department we have some internal
meetings too

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#22:1:A>
For our group we have internal meetings uh <.> twi </.> uh once
every two weeks and in this internal meeting we will uh talk about uh what we
are going to do in uh next two weeks and two weeks later

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#23:1:A>
Furthermore we have a presentation which lasts for uh uh half an
hour to uh one hour 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> Depends

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#24:1:A>
Well I think it is a very good opportunity for us to express
ourselves because I think that uh irrespective to how good our uh research is
if we can't express and don't know how to tell other people how good we have
done it well I don't <.> is </.> I don't think it  ' s worthwhile

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#25:1:A>
So through this kind of presentations we can uh practice our
communication skills and how to present ourselves

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#26:1:A>
The next thing is about the communication between the supervisors
and the student

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#27:1:A>
Well uh different people have different kinds of communication but I
think that we have to find ways to uh get you know how your uh uh the
communication skills or uh linkage between the supervisors and the students
should be uh uh established

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#28:1:A>
Of course these vary from individual to individual I think <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#29:1:A>
And there <,> uh we should have compromises between the different
styles of the supervisors and students of course

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#30:1:A>
I  ' ve talked to some of my research colleagues and find that some
research <.> coll </.> uh uh uh students enjoy doing research at night which
may not be uh uh uh same for for for her supervisor so I think there should
we should find ways to communicate and to custom different styles <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#31:1:A>
And then there  ' s the expectation of the supervisors and the students

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#32:1:A>
Well when I was first uh starting my uh research I <?> thought 
that </?> my supervisors <?> expect </?> me a lot especially at <?> first
</?> and then I find I  ' m not competent in that so I I started
wondering whether I should continue to do my research

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#33:1:A>
Maybe uhm it is only my fault and when I uh talked to my supervisor
about that and my supervisor told me just relax and keep on and doing <.> wor
</.> hard work and you  ' ll find your vision and then you know what I  ' m doing

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#34:1:A>
So I think that by talking with your supervisor is very important
just to make him know uh it  ' s not only uh uh what my research is going on
but what I  ' m uh thinking of myself

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#35:1:A>
And I think after uh doing three years research here in the Hong
Kong Polytechnic I find that I have changed a lot when I compare with uh what
I what my uh style of thinking when I was in undergraduate uh when I was an
undergraduate student

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#36:1:A>
I find that I can uh think more uh deeply in the problem try to
think uh analyse more more thoroughly <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#37:1:A>
And I do think that due to postgraduate course here in Hong Kong or
any other uh countries in the world we can have a different uh mind and well
I think it  ' s worthwhile to have a good opportunity of training oneself

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#38:1:A>
Uh so that  ' s about it </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#39:2:A>
Ladies and gentlemen <,,> I have a teacher <,> Professor Cheung 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> He
is a supervisor for many <,> PhD student in China and one day he asked me a
question 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> He said do you know what is research

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#40:2:A>
I found out the meaning of the word research from the dictionary
and answered research is an advanced and detailed study of a subject so as to
learn new facts

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#41:2:A>
And he told me <.> th </.> that it is only one of the meanings of
research and the word research consists many other meanings that cannot be
found in the dictionary 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> He <,> said that when you want to learn new facts
you have to face many many problems 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> You have to solve them one by one <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#42:2:A>
And in <.> the </.> in at this process <,> you have to search for
the answer of those problems 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> You usually cannot find the right answer the
first time <,> so you have to research for second time

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#43:2:A>
The word so-called research means search again and again and again

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#44:2:A>
For real research work nobody can go from the starting point to the
destination for a straight line <,> no matter how well is the plan

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#45:2:A>
Most of the researcher have the experience of going around and
around about their destination <,> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> However it doesn't mean that they are
wasting their time and power

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#46:2:A>
When they are <?> looking above </?> their destination
or problem they can look at their problems at many different angles and have
a better understanding about <,> uh about their research work about their
research area

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#47:2:A>
Those experience one can get from research sometimes is more
valuable than the results one can get from research <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#48:2:A>
For research work the role of supervisor is extremely important

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> Different supervisor has different characteristic and ability

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#49:2:A>
Some supervisor look after their student very carefully 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> They uh
have very good plan <,> about the research project 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> All the students have to
do is to follow the plan <,> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> Everything is under control and everything the
student that is useful for the research work and there is guarantee for the
<,> for the student can graduate on time

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#50:2:A>
And some supervisor gives their student nothing but only the title
of the research work and this title can be changed later

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#51:2:A>
The student have to make all the decision by themselves <,> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> They
have to spend a lot of time and power in just finding out a right way to go
<,> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> They may spend a lot of time in doing something that is not directly
related to their project and something that cannot be written in the thesis
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#52:2:A>
The supervisor give all the guidelines may not be the best
supervisor

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#53:2:A>
That is because everything is under control 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> The student does not have
to use his brain <,> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> The student  ' s originality will not be trained during
the research period

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#54:2:A>
After the student receive his uh PhD or MPhil degree his problem
solving power will not be improved because he  ' s just following his
supervisor  ' s plan going in a straight line and arrive in the destination within
a very short time

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#55:2:A>
On the other hand the supervisor will give who does not give any
guideline may not be the worst supervisor

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#56:2:A>
It is because the student has to make all the decisions by himself
<,> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#>Even in setting out problems he may spend a lot of time to go around and
run outside the problem 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> However once he  ' s solved those problem the
satisfaction <,> he get cannot be expressed by words

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#57:2:A>
<unc> several-words </unc> what he get is not as simple as
the degree <,> but the experience he adopt when he search search uh research
for the answer for his question

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#58:2:A>
There  ' s no best or worst supervisor but the fittest supervisor

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#59:2:A>
A supervisor whom you think he is the best may not be good for
other student 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> At the same time a supervisor who is very bad in your point of
view may be good for some other students

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#60:2:A>
The problem is <,> find a suitable <?> supervisor </?> </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#61:3:A>
I have just changed the topic of my speech to The
Confession of a Traveller 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> Please uhm please start the green
light <,,>
<O>asides</O>

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#63:3:A>
Well I like travelling <,,> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> What I like about it is that I can show
off my pictures to my friends after the trap trip <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#64:3:A>
But don't ask me where the pictures were taken because I was so
busy sucking up the scenery with my camera that I don't have time to look
around where I was

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#65:3:A>
But with my sense of travelling experience I can share with you
some tips about travelling <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#66:3:A>
First of all about food <,> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> Very important thing <,> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> Once I was in 
<,> Nepal hiking in the mountains 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> The food was so terrible 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> Everywhere
you go the menu was the same vegetables egg egg uh rolls and things like that
and one day to our amazement there was a <,> different dish on the menu <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#67:3:A>
As soon as the food came we had three bowls immediately 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> It tasted
so good 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> It  ' s like food from heaven and what is this delicious food <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> Boiled instant noodles

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#68:3:A>
So the first tip is <,> instant noodle 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> Don't leave home without it
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#69:3:A>
Talking about food I was in a restaurant in Taiwan <,> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> We had a
very good meal and afterwards I wanted to thank the waitress and I said to
her in my <unc> 1-word </unc> Mandarin <,> thank you for your
service 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> It  ' s very good <,,> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> She had a puzzled look on her face <,> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> What do my
parents have to do with you she asked <,> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> Later I found out that <,> I
pronounced the word service <,> <foreign> fu woo </foreign> in the way that
sounded like <foreign> foo wo </foreign> parents <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#70:3:A>
So <,> don't get yourself into trouble 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#>Be sure that you learn your
<.> Man </.> <.> Eng </.> uh your language before you go <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#71:3:A>
Language isn't the only skill that you need when you travel 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> When I
was in <,> a train travelling from Italy to Spain <,> it was an overnight train I didn't reserve a compartment sleeping compartment so I had to <,> find a place <,> to stay

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#72:3:A>
Everywhere was so full 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> Even the toilets were piled high with luggage and I stepped on people  ' s toes people  ' s bodies and there
were ahs and <unc> 1 WORD </unc> everywhere that I went and finally I
found a place <,> to <?> plant </?> my feet <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#73:3:A>
The train started to move and <,> my eyes started to stick together <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#74:3:A>
And that night I learned that I have a skill that I didn't realize
that I have before and that is <,> to sleep standing up <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#75:3:A>
Try this 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> Develop the skill 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> It may help in case of emergency <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#76:3:A>
Coping with unforeseen circumstances is another important thing
that you have to learn

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#77:3:A>
I was in a shopping mall in America <,> looking for food I was so
hungry and when I saw some spaghetti my favourite dish over there I wanted
to <,> rush over to it

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#78:3:A>
I sprinted over at the record speed <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> Next thing I knew I was in water three feet deep <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#79:3:A>
God give me a hole so that I can escape from 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> God didn't listen to
me so I had to climb up sheepishly from the fountain <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#80:3:A>
Five men came to my rescue thank God <,> each holding a card in their
hands <,> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> Do you want to put in a claim <.> ma </.> madam <,> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> I
can give you a good deal <,> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> So much for prompt service <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#81:3:A>
At the end of every trip I gain weight not from over-eating but
from over-shopping <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#82:3:A>
Once when I was in a shopping mall looking for some souvenir for my
brother I explained to the salesgirl <,> my problem <,> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> You see my brother is
quite well-off <,> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> He has a good job 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> He has a Mercedes Benz 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> He has a house of
his own 
<ICE-HK:S2A-037#> Tell me what would you recommend for a man who has everything <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#83:3:A>
Without hesitation she said <,> how about my phone number <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#84:3:A>
To tell you the truth <,> if you are a <.> pho </.> if you are a
photo maniac <,> a choosy eater <,> a confused linguist and an
accident-proned uhm  fumbler and a compulsive souvenir
hunter <,> my advice is <,> stay home at your safe place <,> make yourself a
hot bowl of instant noodles <,,> browse over your photo albums look at your
souvenirs and without the uh without being afraid of falling into the
fountain or having to stand <,> <.> s </.> sleep standing up <,> or looking
for for things to buy <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#85:3:A>
So this is my advice to you

<ICE-HK:S2A-037#86:3:A>
Good luck and happy travelling </I>
