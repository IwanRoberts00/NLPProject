<bold> Yuan fall &lsquo; to help put lid on HK inflation &rsquo;
</bold> </h> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#3:1>
FINANCIAL Secretary Hamish Macleod expects the Chinese currency  ' s
decline in value to help ease inflationary pressures in Hongkong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#4:1>
On a three-day visit to Tokyo , Mr Macleod said the yuan  ' s fall
would have a &ldquo; rather helpful effect in keeping inflation down &rdquo;
in Hongkong by reducing the cost of imports from China , the territory  ' s
biggest trading partner . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#5:1>
His remarks came a day after Hongkong share prices tumbled two per
cent in the wake of China  ' s decision to let the yuan float freely at its
currency swap centres , triggering a sharp decline of more than 20 per cent
against the US dollar . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#6:1>
Mr Macleod said he was unsure of Beijing  ' s motives but noted that
currency convertibility was a prerequisite for becoming a member of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade &obrack; GATT &cbrack; , which China
hopes to re-enter . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#7:1>
He said : &ldquo; I  ' m not sure myself whether we  ' re seeing a
deliberate step or whether we  ' re seeing a short-term reaction &rdquo; to
disparities between official and unofficial exchange rates for the yuan .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#8:1>
&ldquo; I don't think there  ' s any consensus yet about what it
exactly means . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#9:1>
&ldquo; China  ' s action effectively removed the ceiling of eight
yuan to the dollar at currency swap centres .

<ICE-HK:W2C-006#10:1>
The yuan fell to 10.23 to the US dollar at the swap centre in
Shanghai on Thursday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#11:1>
The official rate used by banks , however , remained at 5.7 yuan
to the dollar . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#12:1>
However , Mr Macleod reiterated that the Hongkong dollar would
remain pegged to the US currency , despite the resulting constraints on using
interest rates as a means of cooling inflation , which is forecast to reach
almost 10 per cent this year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#13:1>
&ldquo; We can't basically use the interest rate weapon , &rdquo;
he said .

<ICE-HK:W2C-006#14:1>
&ldquo; That  ' s a price that we accept because we don't really see
any other option . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#15:1>
Addressing a luncheon meeting of the Foreign Correspondents Club
in Tokyo , Mr Macleod painted a rosy picture of Hongkong  ' s future . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#16:1>
He highlighted the territory  ' s airport project in his speech ,
saying that 25 contracts worth more than US&dollar;4.4 billion had so far
been awarded including the site preparation contract for the airport . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#17:1>
So far , Japanese companies had captured the largest share of
these contracts , accounting for 22 per cent by value , &dollar;945 million .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#18:1>
&ldquo; We are now engaged in discussions with China on the
financing arrangements for the new airport and the airport railway .

<ICE-HK:W2C-006#19:1>
Hopefully , these will be successful , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#20:1>
Mr Macleod told the audience in Tokyo that Hongkong  ' s gross
domestic product had been forecast to grow by five per cent a year in real
terms . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#21:1>
Hongkong also enjoyed effective full employment and the stock
market was booming , although inflation posed a problem . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#22:1>
Noting the growth of economic ties with China , Mr Macleod said
Hongkong accounted for about 70 per cent of foreign investment in China while
China  ' s investment in Hongkong was estimated to have exceeded &dollar;12
billion . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#23:1>
&ldquo; It is this role &dash; the role of helping in China  ' s
economic liberalisation and benefitting from China  ' s economic progress
&dash; that particularly inspires confidence and optimism in Hongkong  ' s
future , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#24:1>
&ldquo; We are in good shape .

<ICE-HK:W2C-006#25:1>
We are confident that Hongkong will continue to be in good shape
after 1997 . &rdquo; </p> </I>

<bold> Taiwan stocks up for grabs </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-006#27:2>
<bold> By KENNETH KO </bold> </h 
 

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#28:2>
TAIWAN Securities , the first securities firm from the island to
set up in Hongkong , is seeking to put local capital into the Taiwan stock
market . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#29:2>
Taiwan Securities &obrack; HK &cbrack; began work at the end of
last month after winning the approval of the Securities and Futures
Commission to provide securities trading , investment and corporate advice
services . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#30:2>
Managing director Chin Cheng-sin said his firm was keen to sell
Taiwan financial commodities to Hongkong investors , but that required
permission from the SFC and Taiwan  ' s Securities and Exchange Commission
because Taiwan  ' s central bank controlled the flow of foreign capital into
the island . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#31:2>
Mr Chin said the SEC had in principle approved movement of
Hongkong capital by Taiwan Securities &obrack; HK &cbrack; into the island  ' s
securities industry , but it had yet to work out how shares bought should be
traded . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#32:2>
Hongkong  ' s SFC also required the firm to meet criteria to ensure
protection of investors buying shares </p> </I>

<bold> More top-grade office Space Forecast to go vacant </bold> </h>
<h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-006#34:3>
<bold> By KENNETH KO </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#35:3>
THE vacancy rates of top-grade offices will rise to about 11.9
per cent by the end of the year because of oversupply , says property agent
Richard Eills . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#36:3>
In its regional office market report it said the territory  ' s
office vacancy rates now stood at nine per cent , compared with 7.5 per cent
six months ago . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#37:3>
Only 66 per cent of the total new office supply of 1.87 million
sq ft in the past six months had been taken up , it said , while rentals had
fallen by about six 10 per cent . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#38:3>
At the end of last month , total prime officer space was about
31.9 million sq ft . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#39:3>
Of this total , Central accounted for about 44 per cent with 14.1
million sq ft . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#40:3>
Richard Ellis expects 6.5 million sq ft of top-grade office space
to come on stream over the next two years . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#41:3>
The bulk of the new supply would by in Wan Chai and Causeway Bay
, with only 1.9 million sq ft projected to be a available in core and
peripheral Central . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#42:3>
In Tsim Sha Tsui , the third traditional office location , about
1.5 million sq ft of prime office accommodation is scheduled to come on to
the market . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#43:3>
&ldquo; The increased level of new supply , in Wan Chai and
Causeway Bay in particular , is forecast to result in the continued downward
adjustment of rents and prices , at least until mid-1992 , &rdquo; the agent
said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#44:3>
Monthly rents for prime office square foot last month , down 23.2
per cent from &dollar;56 a year earlier . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#45:3>
The report said top-grade office accommodation fetched a selling
price of about &dollar;5,300 a square foot . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#46:3>
However , Richard Eills maintains that Hongkong remains an office
investment market , offering opportunities for both institution and
entrepreneurial investors . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#47:3>
Meanwhile , a property consultant said the growing and ageing
population was the &ldquo; invisible hand &rdquo; behind the residential
property boom in the territory . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#48:3>
Mr Stephen Suen , the managing director Treasure Land Property
Consultant , said the median age of the local population had risen from 26
years in 1981 to 32 , and more people were in their 30s when they were
financially stronger . </p> </I>

<bold> ITDC board set to hold first meeting </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-006#50:4>
<bold> By KENNETH KO </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#51:4>
THE recently-formed Industry and Technology Development Council
&obrack; ITDC &cbrack; will hold its first board meeting on January 23 to map
out its future plans , acting director-general of industry Wilfred Wong said
yesterday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#52:4>
The meeting would also form sub-committees and set out their
respective areas of responsibility , he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#53:4>
Mr Wong added that the findings of the year-long study on the
chemical processing industry in Hongkong would be presented to the ITDC board
members at the meeting . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#54:4>
The study was aimed at assessing the value of the chemical
processing industry in Hongkong , where its factories were located , and the
demand for chemical products . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#55:4>
The ITDC , which came in existence on January 1 , is an advisory
body created by merging the existing Industry Development Board and the
Committee on Science and Technology . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#56:4>
Mr Wong said the body would comprise some 20 board members , of
whom six would be representatives of the Government.

<ICE-HK:W2C-006#57:4>
Although the names of the members have yet to be announced ,
Director-General of Industry Tyebjee Barma is expected to be one of them .

<bold> Auctions of land raise &dollar;6.45b </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-006#59:5>
<bold> By KENNETH KO </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#60:5>
LAND sales at public auction have raised about &dollar;6.45
billion for the Government so far this financial year , against &dollar;3.13
billion for the whole of the previous financial year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#61:5>
The revenue , excluding that from sales by cash tender or land
exchange entitlement tender , has already substantially surpassed the
Government  ' s forecast for its land sale programme . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#62:5>
This year  ' s land sale programme originally covered 24.07
hectares , but the Sino-British Land Commission recently released an
additional 5.9 hectares . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#63:5>
Since April , a total of 16 plots of Crown land have been offered
at land auctions &dash; including nine residential lots , five
industrial/godown lots , and two commercial lots . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#64:5>
The nine residential lots together raised nearly &dollar;5.64
billion or 87.4 per cent of the total for the year to date , reflecting the
residential boom and the fact that flats prices have surged by about 60 per
cent in 1991 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#65:5>
Four of the residential sites auctioned were underutilised
government quarters , where the administration regarded as surplus to
requirements . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#66:5>
A 95,800-square-foot residential site in Kong  ' s Park Rise , also
Government quarters , will be auctioned in February . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#67:5>
When the land sales programme was announced in March , it was
forecast that the sale of five Government quarters sites would raise about
&dollar;850 million &semi; with only four sold so far the total revenue is
already about &dollar;1.9 billion . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#68:5>
One of the most notable sales was the auction of a 229,811 sq ft
residential site in Tai Po in October , which was sold for &dollar;1.25
billion to a consortium of Realty Development Corp &obrack; RDC &cbrack; ,
Sino Land and China Overseas Building Development &obrack; COBC &cbrack; .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#69:5>
Another major sale was the auction of a 145,637 sq ft residential
lot in Fanling in July , which was taken by Sino Land at a price of
&dollar;1.01 billion . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#70:5>
RDC , a subsidiary of World International &obrack; Holdings
&cbrack; , and Sino Land virtually dominated the public auctions this year .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#71:5>
RDC bought three sites , while Sino Land snapped up four sites on
its own .

<ICE-HK:W2C-006#72:5>
The two groups also teamed up to buy two sites , and they allied with
COBD to take two other sites . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#73:5>
For the remaining three months of this fiscal year , seven more
lots of Crown land will be put up for public auction &dash; including four
residential lots . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#74:5>
The next public auction is due to take place on January 15 , with
a 59,578 sq ft commercial lot and a 3,731 sq ft residential lot on offer .

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#77:6>
SUN Hung Kai Properties is expanding its luxury residential
development , Palm Springs , with the purchase of two million square feet of
land in Yuen Long . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#78:6>
A company spokesman yesterday confirmed the acquisition of
additional land in Wo Shang Wai to extend the Palm Springs project . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#79:6>
She said the purchase would allow the company to develop better
support facilities for the low-density residential project , but declined to
provide details of the transaction . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#80:6>
However , analysts say the additional land could provide a gross
floor area of 800,000 to one million square feet for residential use . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#81:6>
Palm Springs comprises 1,200 three-storey garden houses of 1,200
to 1,600 square feet each . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#82:6>
The residential project , costing more than &dollar;1 billion ,
currently covers three million square feet of land in Wo Shang Wai , with a
plot ratio of four . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#83:6>
With the additional two million square feet of land , Palm
Springs will become one of the largest low-density residential developments
in the territory . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-006#84:6>
Property analysts estimate that Sun Hung Kai is required to spend
a further &dollar;1 billion for the extension of Palm Springs . </p> </I>
