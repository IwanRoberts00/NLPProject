<bold> Love Letters </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#2:1>
&lsquo; Have you found any love letters in your locker ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#3:1>
Are there any boys staring at you in class ? &rsquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#4:1>
Mother kept asking me questions like that since last Tuesday ,
when a Mr. Chan had phoned me at 11:30p.m while I was out with Father . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#5:1>
Having studied in a Girls  '  school for so many years &dash; from
kindergarten through to Form Seven , I could count the number of boys I knew
using the fingers on one hand .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#6:1>
Even after I entered a university , two hands were enough for the
count , and I had never received a phone-call from a boy before .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#7:1>
Mother said that a boy who phones you after 11:00 p.m. must be
infatuated with you .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#8:1>
Of course I wanted to know who he was , but to make a good guess was
not easy because I have never known the boys well enough to know their last
names .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#9:1>
So , who was that Mr. Chan ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#10:1>
Since then , every day I came to school , I looked into the eyes
of every male who I came across to see if there was a sign of love .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#11:1>
I opened my locker twice a day to check if there was a love letter
inside .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#12:1>
But to my disappointment , nothing unusual happened . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#13:1>
Yes , I was expecting something &lsquo; unusual &rsquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#14:1>
Last week when our secondary classmates were having a gathering at a
Chinese restaurant , everyone brought along their other halves &dash; their
boyfriends , except me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#15:1>
I remembered my best fiend , Jane , had once told me she would never
have a boyfriend when studying in a university and then get married
immediately after graduating .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#16:1>
We two had promised each other that we wouldn't drift with the
current as we are going to be extraordinary persons ...

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#17:1>
But now , how extraordinary she was &dash; in the arms of her
boyfriend &semi; while I was using my two hands , grabbing the only arm I
could get &dash; the chicken wing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#18:1>
It was on Monday this week , a day I would never forget , that I
met my O'camp group leader , John .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#19:1>
I was having lunch alone . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#20:1>
&lsquo; Hey , what happened to you , looking so pale ? &rsquo;
said John . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#21:1>
&lsquo; A cold . &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#22:1>
As I was putting the chicken leg into my mouth , I sneezed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#23:1>
A pack of Tempo was then put in front of me . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#24:1>
&lsquo; By the way , I phoned you last week but you were not at
home .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#25:1>
I just wanted to invite you to join the service on Saturday . &rsquo;
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#26:1>
Oh , he was that Chan !

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#27:1>
It might be ridiculous but , with the Tempo he gave to me , my cold
was cured immediately . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#28:1>
The next day when I came to school , I met him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#29:1>
And the day after , I met him twice .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#30:1>
Within four days , we met for six times on campus .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#31:1>
Was that a kind of coincidence or ...

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#32:1>
Though every time we only had the time to say &lsquo; Hi &rsquo; , I
couldn't help but think of that Hi-C advertisement &dash; &lsquo; Like
sunshine , you light up my life ... &rsquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#33:1>
And on Thursday , I received an e-mail from Chan .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#34:1>
I finally learned his given names &dash; Chi-heung was displayed on
the screen .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#35:1>
In Chinese , it means ambitious , I supposed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#36:1>
&lsquo; Are you free tomorrow ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#37:1>
I  ' d like to invite you to join my birthday party &obrack; ha , just
kidding &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#38:1>
How about going to see a movie in the non-print section of the
library at 2:30 p.m. tomorrow ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#39:1>
Reply today . &rsquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#40:1>
It would be my first date !

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#41:1>
I was so eager to go , but being a girl I should be more restrained ,
as mother always said .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#42:1>
So I hid my happiness and just replied , &lsquo; see you at 2:30p.m.
tomorrow , at the non-print section . &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#43:1>
After school that day , I saw him again and I gave him a special
smile . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#44:1>
I couldn't sleep well that night .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#45:1>
All the time I rehearsed the scene of the next day in my mind .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#46:1>
I ironed the only dress I had , which was bought for the graduation
party when I was in Form Five .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#47:1>
I stole some cosmetics from Mom too , though I didn't use them
because I couldn't figure out which things were for what purposes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#48:1>
On Friday , at exactly 2:30p.m. , I reached the non-print section .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#49:1>
He had not come yet and while I was waiting , I counted my heartbeats
, as my heart was thumping so loud that even those standing next to me could
hear it . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#50:1>
&lsquo; Hey , Laura , you are so early . &rsquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#51:1>
Was that my Chi-heung ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#52:1>
No , it was a she , Judy , my classmate .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#53:1>
She continued , &lsquo; so , let  ' s see the movie together . &rsquo;
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#54:1>
Of course I won't let her spoil my first date . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#55:1>
&lsquo; Sorry Judy , but I am expecting someone . &rsquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#56:1>
&lsquo; But you have promised me in the mail . &rsquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#57:1>
&lsquo; You mean e-mail ? &rsquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#58:1>
&lsquo; Of course .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#59:1>
What else would it be &dash; blackmail ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#60:1>
Yesterday you gave a reply saying ... &lsquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#61:1>
&lsquo; Excuse me , what  ' s your name ? &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#62:1>
my face began to turn pale and my cold seemed to be back again . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#63:1>
&lsquo; I  ' m Judy Chan , Chi-heung ! &lsquo; </p> </I>

<I> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#64:2>
<bold> Good Night , Good Morning </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#65:2>
Standing in front of the hawker  ' s stand , I turn my coat collar
up and then search for the ten-dollar coin in my pocket .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#66:2>
Without another word , the hawker fills the brown tiny paper bag with
<ul> two stinking bean curds </ul > , one with thick chili sauce , the other
with the sweet one , as usual .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#67:2>
The bean curd is part of my life , or I should say , I am part of the
hawker  ' s life &dash; from <indig> <ul> Youde </ul> </indig> to the <indig>
<ul> Fat Tung </ul> </indig> , from two dollars to five dollars each , I buy
the bean curd from him every night on my way to work . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#68:2>
&ldquo; Good night , &rdquo; I said to him , the first words I  ' ve
ever spoken to him all these years , and perhaps , the last words as well .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#69:2>
The dripping sausages paint my footsteps on this wet and
fishy-smelling street leading to the building .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#70:2>
Ha , still no thief follows my &ldquo; footsteps &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#71:2>
&ldquo; Hey , pray to your papa before you go the work , &rdquo;
same old words , my wife used to say , &ldquo; remember to take this safety
yellow paper with you , I got it from Wong Tai Sin yesterday ... &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#72:2>
Every time I just put the &ldquo; magic yellow paper &rdquo;
under the mat in front of the door when I left home .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#73:2>
Of course , my wife did not know that .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#74:2>
She never understood me &dash; every one wants to lead a peaceful
life but please , don't count me in .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#75:2>
I had never told her my ambition was to be a policeman , and now , I
have no more chance to tell her . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#76:2>
Though my shaking hand is covered with the sauces , I try to feel
that triangular yellow paper , which has been tied onto my neck since the day
she left .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#77:2>
Yes , still here . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#78:2>
When I get into the building , it is 12:00 am , half an hour
earlier than my duty should begin .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#79:2>
The last guard has already packed his luxuries collected all these
years &dash; the blanket , the folded bed , the old blue magazines , and ,
the latest horse racing tips collection .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#80:2>
I just can't understand why people nowadays throw things out so
easily .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#81:2>
See ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#82:2>
My radio , which I got from the 15th floor a few years ago , can
still work if you press the battery tighter . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#83:2>
&ldquo; Bee-bu-bu-bu- &rdquo; 12:30am , the one entering the
password of the front door must be the girl living on the 18th floor , I am
sure .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#84:2>
Wearing her mini-skirt , makeup like a monkey  ' s ass .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#85:2>
She used to be a nice and charming girl .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#86:2>
I still remember the days when she was in school uniform , she walked
by early at 6am every day , with her pony tail swaying .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#87:2>
&ldquo; Good morning , <indig> Wong Pak </indig> &ldquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#88:2>
&ldquo; Good night , &rdquo; she said , with her mini-skirt
swaying as she entered the lift . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#89:2>
&ldquo; Good night . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#90:2>
Finished unpacking my stuff and eating my bean curd .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#91:2>
My body gets warmer again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#92:2>
At 2 am , I put up the &ldquo; On Patrol &rdquo; sign , for the last
time . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#93:2>
&ldquo; Ei ... err ... &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#94:2>
&ldquo; Is it you , my friend ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#95:2>
No one answers .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#96:2>
After the establishment of the Owner  ' s Corporation , my only friends
&dash; the rats and the cats were all killed , leaving me to patrol all alone .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#97:2>
The sound is just what generated when I open the smoke door .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#98:2>
But I know , behind this door , there will be some sort of excitement
&dash; from Flat F on this 5th floor . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#99:2>
&ldquo; Hey , you S.O.B. , back to Mainland to find your <ul>
second wife </ul> ! &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#100:2>
&ldquo; Boom-Boom ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#101:2>
The sound of a thrown chair ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#102:2>
Eavesdropping becomes my only entertainment while patrolling the
building . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#103:2>
&ldquo; I just want my only wife back , not any second ones
&rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#104:2>
I whispered in front of their door , &ldquo; good luck and good
night ! &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#105:2>
Just imagine if I had got the stories of this building written
and published , the loyalties received could have probably made me rich !

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#106:2>
Rather than now , the salary cannot even buy my food .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#107:2>
And the pension ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#108:2>
Not enough for me to buy a coffin !

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#109:2>
Oh yeah , a thousand million dollars is in front of me now : Bingo !

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#110:2>
It  ' s The Sun , with accurate horseracing tips .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#111:2>
Tomorrow , if ... if I still have tomorrow .. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#112:2>
I went back to my counter with The yesterday  ' s Sun , after
passing along every corridor of this building .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#113:2>
Nothing happens , as usual .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#114:2>
3am , I switch on my radio , yes , that radio . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#115:2>
Good morning my dear , welcome to listen to <ul> RTHK </ul> 2 ,
I  ' m your Ocean Chan ... &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#116:2>
&ldquo; Good morning . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#117:2>
&ldquo; Unlike the past , today I  ' m going to broadcast you the
latest songs , by Aaron , Leon ... &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#118:2>
&ldquo; Not <ul> Teresa Teng </ul> or <ul> Adam Cheng </ul> ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#119:2>
<ul> The Wynners </ul> would also be fine ! &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#120:2>
<it> &ldquo; This is our world .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#121:2>
We are the Youth .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#122:2>
Nothing That We Care About .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#123:2>
Ha Ha Ha Ha ... &rdquo; </it> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#124:2>
&ldquo; &ldquo; Good night ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#125:2>
Don't have to switch the on/off button , I loosen the battery cover .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#126:2>
&ldquo; Youth , Youth , Youth , Youth ...

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#127:2>
I count the number of wrinkles on my forehead , with my fingers
feeling them one by one .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#128:2>
The train tracks , just train tracks , the tracks which my train
once rode on when I arrived in Hong Kong from the Mainland , are now pressed
on my forehead .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#129:2>
The days ... </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#130:2>
&ldquo; &ldquo; Good morning , <indig> Wong Pak </indig> , have
your breakfast ? &rdquo; asked one old maid . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#131:2>
&ldquo; &ldquo; Good morning , <indig> Wong Pak </indig> , why
not listen to the radio ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#132:2>
Out of order again ? &rdquo; asked the other . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#133:2>
&ldquo; &ldquo; When you have time , <indig> Wong Pak </indig> ,
we can go out and practise <indig> kung-fu </indig> together ! &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#134:2>
&ldquo; 5am , immediately I know .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#135:2>
They are the &ldquo; Fitness Club &rdquo; members of our building .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#136:2>
Every morning before the cock crows , they go to the neighboring
park to practise <indig> &ldquo; Kung-fu¡¨ </indig> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#137:2>
&ldquo; &ldquo; One day .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#138:2>
One day ... &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#139:2>
&ldquo; It  ' s a bit colder in this early morning , and , a bit
darker .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#140:2>
I put on the <-> woolen </-> <+> woollen </+> sweater which my wife
knit for me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#141:2>
The new and young security guard will be coming in his full uniform
, as recommended by the Owners  '  Corporation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#142:2>
&ldquo; Soon I will leave this tiny dizzy room . I put some
drops of <ul> White Flower Oil </ul> on my forehead .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#143:2>
Not long , I can breathe the fresh air again &semi; not long , I can
go to practise <indig> Kung-fu </indig> with those guys . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#144:2>
&ldquo; &ldquo; Good morning , &rdquo; the uniformed one finally
comes , with a loaf of Life Bread in a Park'n Shop plastic bag . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#145:2>
&ldquo; Immediately he glances through this tiny guard counter ,
seems searching something , with his two fingers pinching his nose .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#146:2>
It  ' s the mixed smell of the <indig> stinking bean curd </indig> and
the <ul> White Flower Oil </ul> , I know .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#147:2>
Looking into his eyes , I see them sparkling with the light of
energy and hope , I see myself : I once stood in his position , in my brand
new white shirt and shorts , and with that eye-catching ring shining on the
third finger . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#148:2>
&ldquo; Good morning . &rdquo; </p> </I>

<I> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#149:3>
<bold> The Lonely Flower </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#150:3>
&ldquo; At night , the little flower was very lonely .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#151:3>
She couldn't see Uncle Sun , nor her brother dew .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#152:3>
She put her head down slowly , and quietly , and to her surprise ,
she saw another little flower staring at her in a steady flowing stream .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#153:3>
&ldquo; Little flower , good morning .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#154:3>
Are u as lonely as me ? &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#155:3>
The flower in the stream didn't answer .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#156:3>
The silence seemed to laugh at the silly flower .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#157:3>
&ldquo; Little flower little flower , can't you hear ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#158:3>
Can u be friends with me ? &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#159:3>
Her whisper woke up a little bee .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#160:3>
<indig> &ldquo; Yung-yung-yung </indig> &dash; hey , my dear little
flower , I  ' m your friend .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#161:3>
Anything happens , just tell me . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#162:3>
&ldquo; Yes , you are my friend , but you don't understand how
lonely a flower is at night .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#163:3>
Cos u are a bee . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#164:3>
The little bee flew back to his home .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#165:3>
And the flower in the stream still said nothing .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#166:3>
Suddenly , a strong wind blew across the water .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#167:3>
That little flower in stream disappeared all of a sudden .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#168:3>
&ldquo; My friend , where are u ? &rdquo; cried the lonely one .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#169:3>
Like a miracle , after the wind had gone , the flower in the
stream came back again and kept looking up to the land . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#170:3>
Welcome back ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#171:3>
Though she knew her friend would never answer , she couldn't hide
her happiness and so she said it anyway .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#172:3>
This time , the flower in stream seemed to smile at her and nod as
if she were really pleased . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#173:3>
Since then , the lonely flower had someone to accompany her ,
and she was no longer bored nor lonely .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#174:3>
She told her friend about the funny things she saw each morning .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#175:3>
and they smiled and laughed at the same time , their mouths open so
wide that three bees could have visited together .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#176:3>
Though the flower in the stream never speaks or laughs with sound ,
she knows that her friend is as happy or so she can see . </p>

The little flower got older and older until one day she started
to wilt .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#178:3>
She saw that her friend was looking just as pale . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#179:3>
&ldquo; Thanx , my dear little flower,for accompanying me so
many days . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#180:3>
And then her neck broke .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#181:3>
She fell onto the water and it was her first time to be so close to
her friend .

<ICE-HK:W2F-003#182:3>
She saw and observed and when she and her friend became one ... she
recognised that everything was just an illusion , just an image of herself .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-003#183:3>
The sound of dropping into the water was the last word of this
little flower , and the first sound made by her friend in the silent air .
