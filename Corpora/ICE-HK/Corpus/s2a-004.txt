Well a very good evening and welcome to the Macau Jockey Club  ' s
Taipo racecourse once again sand racing this evening ten races on the surface
and the going is no more watering

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#2:1:A>
At the moment runners behind the barriers for race number two it is
the Otaki Handicap class six gallopers thirteen hundred metres <,> and we do
have a riding change in this race number six Panda Power in fact the horse on
screen is to be ridden by Robbie Burke

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#3:1:A>
Now just quickly our commentators selections for race two Harry Troy
has gone two one nine and four <,> Universe to defeat Little Big John House
Of Fortunes and Golden Apple <,> Harry uh Franko Lau sorry has gone nine six
and seven House Of Fortunes to defeat Panda Power and Buddha Venture

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#4:1:A>
Uh I found it a very very tough race uh Little Big John you always
got the impression he was always going to uh come up favourite but not one I
could really be tipping or <,> be very confident about uh but when you look
at the race uh pretty hard to find horse to beat him but I thought number
eight was a touch of value Ever Gaining <,> he  ' s a ten year old but seldom
too far away so <,> if you are getting twelve to one about him which I think
is a decent quote

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#5:1:A>
Panda Power is a horse that uh I wanted to watch closely in the race
because he  ' s an erratic customer and can play up uh quite badly but <,>
tonight <,> uh he really has behaved which is quite unusual he can get
stirred up he can be uh a big uh problem on the way to the gates <,> they  ' ve
walked him to the gates and he  ' s standing there as quiet as a lamb so far

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#6:1:A>
Uh so that  ' s a very positive factor for Panda Power because usually
he just gets far too worked up and I thought uh House Of Fortune was another
deserved of respect so I  ' m going eight six and nine for race two

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#7:1:A>
Quickly we  ' ll go through the chances for tonight uh probably about
a minute until they start loading <,> race one a withdrawal Easy Partner is
out replaced by the standby Ogm  ' s Power barrier nine Robbie Burke rode

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#8:1:A>
Just repeating in this second event Robbie Burke now rides number 6
Panda  ' s Power <,> unfortunately Bradley Stewart suffering a fall at track
work this morning

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#9:1:A>
Our next change comes in race four <,> number six Billionaire is out
replaced by the first standby Decent Exposure barrier eleven <,> Chris Maund
in the saddle

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#10:1:A>
Race five take out number eight Smartie race five number eight <,>
our final change comes in race ten and it  ' s a riding change number two
Cheers Partner is now Chris Maund

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#11:1:A>
Our feature tonight is race seven the Andan Handicap a terrific
class one contest over a thousand metres <,> two of our top rated horses in
Macau Best Brothers and Gold World Winner <,> both from the Leyshan yard in
the field <,> of course Best Brothers eyeing an invitation to Hong Kong this
year <,> and Gold World Winner the current sand king

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#12:1:A>
We now have the red light for race two just repeating Franko Lau
has gone nine six and seven <,> Harry Troy two one nine and four <,> not a
race I was uh packed with confidence but I went eight Ever Gaining <,>
although I did go for him because he was good odds he  ' s now been smashed
down to five to one

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#13:1:A>
But eight Ever Gaining for me due to consistency <,> six Panda
Power because he has settled down and nine House Of Fortunes

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#14:1:A>
As you can see they are loading for this second event as we now
cross over to Harry Troy

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-004#15:1:B>
Thanks Steve and a very good evening everyone <,> the runners
are loading quickly for the second of the night

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#16:1:B>
The Otaki Handicap and we are having some problems getting Buddha
Venture into line but he goes in quite easily now <,> Panda Power goes
forward <,> we  ' ve got two out of line uh Universe and Golden Apple

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#17:1:B>
Universe is going to jump the favourite at about two point two

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#18:1:B>
Now they are attending to a runner in the centre it could be Ever
Gaining <,> that  ' s he in the pink cap <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#19:1:B>
Still some problems <,> just cannot quite see from our vantage
point what is the problem here

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#20:1:B>
We  ' ve got a runner out wide causing some trouble that  ' s
definitely Ever Gaining <,> also towards the inside Panda Power

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#21:1:B>
Not quite locked away that  ' s the problem <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#22:1:B>
And he  ' s <,> in fact he might have been locked away well uh we  ' ve
got one down so that  ' s <,> even worse and that  ' s Golden Apple that  ' s
gotten down <,> no it  ' s not Golden Apple it is gate nine <,,> it  ' s Ah Some
Toy for sure and certain

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#23:1:B>
So that  ' s the problem he decided to sit completely down <,> this
horse has been a problem horse in the past

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#24:1:B>
And they  ' ve had to bring a couple of runners out either side of
him <,,> and for sure and certain he  ' s going to be a late scratching <,> in
fact he  ' s off the big board already

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#25:1:B>
Now the favourite at around two point two almost an even money
quote for Universe he jumps from gate four <,> second favourite Little Big
John from barrier one

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#26:1:B>
Now we  ' ve got to reload these other runners now that they  ' ve got
Ah Some Toy out of the way <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#27:1:B>
At the back we  ' ve got Panda Power and Buddha Venture <,> other
runners have been in there quite a while and they stand up okay <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#28:1:B>
And Ah Some Toy his name disappeared off the infield <unc>
one-word </unc> board <,> quite quickly before they even got him to his
feet now <,> let us have a look what is going on over there

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#29:1:B>
Buddha Venture goes forward <,> Panda Power  ' s going to be the last
one to link up <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#30:1:B>
Set and they  ' re off and running at long last <,> getting away well
on the inside was Little Big John <,> House Of Fortune is very prominent with
Universe <,> likewise Ever Gaining and <?> his stablemate </?> Buddha Venture
is going to be quoted five and six deep as they link up to the course proper

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#31:1:B>
Panda Power wasn't away that well but has recovered <,> and parks
right on the back of the leaders as they go by the nine hundred about two
back then Golden Apple <,> who  ' s back in the early part today followed by
Viking Hero <,> Jubilation the tailender but only six and seven off the lead
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#32:1:B>
In front House Of Fortune  ' s eight hundred metres out and he
travels nicely <,> a neck away Ever Gaining racing more prominent tonight <,>
crowded a bit deep Buddha Venture <,> Little Big John enjoys a nice run he  ' s
fourth the rail <,> splitting them in the centre is Universe <,> a bit deep
Golden Apple by the six hundred he  ' s having a tough run followed then by
under plenty of pressure Panda Power <,> followed then by Viking Hero and
losing touch Jubilation <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#33:1:B>
Five hundred out <,> House of Fortune  ' s in front he  ' s off the
bridle he leads a neck <,> in second spot Ever Gaining <,> enjoying a lovely
run Little Big John he  ' ll need a little bit of luck from there but he
travels well <,> and just behind then Universe <,> well into the straight <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#34:1:B>
And House of Fortune  ' s the pilot <,> Little Big John raced up now
and puts the head in front <,> coming late then Panda Power and running on
down the outside Buddha Venture but Little Big John  ' s shot away <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#35:1:B>
150 out <,> Little Big John  ' s out by a length and a half Panda
Power Buddha Venture running on <,> but Little Big John is going to be a
little bit too strong for them <,> Little Big John he  ' s only to last to win
by three parts Panda Power <,> third over the line is going to be Buddha
Venture <,> rushing home late then was uh Viking Hero <,> Universe followed
then by weakening away was Ever Gaining followed then by House Of Fortune <,>
next over the line was Golden Apple and Jubilation last

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#36:1:B>
Oh he was travelling very well in the run for Danny Beasley just
needed an out <,> and just had to give Ever Gaining it was a little bit of an
nudge to get into the clear <,> and dashed away put the issue beyond doubt
<,> and he raced nicely clear Little Big John <,> getting into second Panda
Power and that did jump the favourite quinella one and six <,> returning
around seventy dollars <,> Buddha Venture  ' s ran on okay for third <,>
Universe I think got held up <,> coming to the turn he  ' s run on well late
but right down the outside Viking Hero <,> has made it interesting for third
but placings will be one six and seven with Viking Hero winding up in fourth
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#37:1:B>
One six seven <,> one six seven and ten in fact and the winner
number one <,> Little Big John <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#38:1:B>
A five year old bay New Zealand bred gelding by Jetball from the
Wild Rampage mare Raging <,> and Danny Beasley rode for K K Sin <,> just a
bit too good for them down here in the class six ranks <,> Danny Beasley <,>
four wins on the weekend took his tally to 13 and <,> getting on the
scoreboard very early tonight <,> he  ' s got some nice rides later on

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#39:1:B>
Number six is second Panda Power Robbie Burke for Wing Leung <,>
number seven winding up in third Buddha Venture Hiden Cheung Tai Lam and
officially fourth <,> number ten Viking Hero Horace Lam for Alan Leung <,>
one six seven and ten <,> and the late scratching of number three Ah Some Toy
<,> Universe did jump the favourite but Little Big John after enjoying a
lovely run throughout <,> and he got into the clear at the right time with a
bit to good for them <,> one six seven and ten here  ' s Steve

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-004#40:1:A>
Long time between drinks for Little Big John it  ' s uh well
over eighteen months since he last scored in fact his only win in Macau and
that was class four <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#41:1:A>
On that night they blazed in front and he came uh just came with a
late run down the outside <,> even then really just plodded plodded to the
line and he  ' s been uh a disappointing horse for a while but uh here he is in
class six and he  ' s just been a little too strong for this field and it was a
pretty weak contest all the same <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-004#42:1:A>
