The greatness in the number of vocabulary in the English language
is amazing to most learners which are foreign to the language itself .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#2:1>
In fact , the greatness in the number of vocabulary is not entirely
unique to English .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#3:1>
It happens in many other languages such as German , French , many
other European languages , Chinese , ...... , etc .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#4:1>
But , by what means can we classify a word as a member of the English
language ?

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#5:1>
There is no simple answers to this question .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#6:1>
As Crystal &obrack; 1990 , 32 &cbrack; has once put it this way : </p>
<p> <X>

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#X7:1>
<it> How many words are there in English ?

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#X8:1>
This apparently simple little question turns out to be surprisingly
complicated .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#X9:1>
Estimates have been given ranging from half a million to over two
million .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#X10:1>
It partly depends on what you count as English words , and partly on
where you go looking for them . </X> &obrack; Crystal , 1990 , 32 &cbrack;
</it> </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-001#11:1>
In fact , Crystal has given us some insight on this &longdash;

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#12:1>
it depends on what you count as English words .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#13:1>
Therefore , there must be some criteria for us to regard a word as a
member of the English language .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#14:1>
However , this becomes an extremely difficult task since there is no
outward limit of the English vocabulary .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#15:1>
As Murray &obrack; 1888 , 59 &cbrack; has said in his introduction to
<it> A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles , Vol. 1 , 1888 :
</it> </p>
<p> <X>

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#X16:1>
The vocabulary of a widely-diffused and highly-cultivated living
language is not a fixed quantity circumscribed by definite limits .......

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#X17:1>
the English vocabulary contains a nucleus or central mass of many
thousand words whose &lsquo; Anglicity &rsquo; is unquestioned . </X> <it>
&obrack; Murray , 1888 , 59 &cbrack; </it>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-001#18:1>
The &lsquo; common &lsquo; words of the English language are
linked on many different aspects , such as words from science , new
technology , slang , dialect , foreign origin , etc .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#19:1>
There is actually <quote> &ldquo; no defining line in any direction :
the circle of the English language has a well-defined centre but no
discernible circumference . </quote> &ldquo; &obrack; Murray , 1888 , 59
&cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#20:1>
Therefore , by knowing all words , if possible , does not really mean
that one can say which word is a member of the English language . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-001#21:1>
As such , the concern in this essay is not on the origin of each
word .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#22:1>
Rather , it concerns how we can explain a word as the member of the
English language . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-001#23:1>
One obvious explanation may be in terms of historical context .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#24:1>
As <quote> &ldquo; the vocabulary of English is richly heterogeneous
, luxuriant in its profuseness and quirkish in its changes of meaning &ldquo;
</quote> &obrack; Hughes , 1988 . 2 &cbrack; , one can assume that we can
explain which word is a member of the English language by referring to
specific historical events which led to expansion of the &lsquo;
circumference &rsquo; of English vocabulary .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#25:1>
As Hughes &obrack; 1988 , 3-4 &cbrack; also says , <quote> &ldquo; In
it can be traced the differing linguistic legacies left by a conquering
Norman elite , a decimated Celtic minority , a partially successful invasion
of Norse rivals , and a series of four major Latin influxes which can be
respectively characterised &obrack; in terms of historical periods &cbrack;
as basic , religious , bookish and scientific . &ldquo; </quote>

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#26:1>
This probably illustrates the importance of putting historical
context into explaining the constituent of English vocabulary .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#27:1>
And , it is hoped that some major historical eras and events
discussed in the following part can give an insight to what contributes a
word to be a member in the English language . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-001#28:1>
Vocabulary in the English language is not homogeneous in nature .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#29:1>
This means that , in its simplest sense , the whole group of the
English vocabulary we use today does not only come from one origin .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#30:1>
In fact , to a certain extent , the making of the English language
was contributed by several invasions &longdash; namely Germanic , Viking and
Norman invasions .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#31:1>
Under each important historical era of invasion , English underwent
certain changes &longdash; since each invasion had great impact on the
language generally used by the public , political organisation , culture ,
education and social life ...... , and many other social aspects that we
can imagine .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#32:1>
However , this does not mean that the language set up previously was
totally destroyed and a new one , under a new culture , was imposed .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#33:1>
It simply means that the English language was modelled and changed
under the impact of these three invasions .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#34:1>
Therefore , we can say that , from the perspective of political
invasion , the English language that we are using nowadays is heterogeneous
in nature .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#35:1>
And , we can use these historical events to explain the constituent
of English vocabulary since many new words might be added into the existing
language in each invasion . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-001#36:1>
Actually , the word <it> <mention> &lsquo; English &rsquo;
</mention> </it> comes from the name of one of the Germanic tribes which
invaded the island during fifth and sixth centuries : the Angles .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#37:1>
The other two tribes which invaded England at approximately the same
time were the Jutes and the Saxons .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#38:1>
According to Jackson &obrack; 1988 , 19 &cbrack; , the Angles settled
in the areas of England to the north of the River Thames whereas the Jutes
settled in what is now Kent and the remaining part was occupied by Saxons .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#39:1>
They probably spoke mutually intelligible dialects .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#40:1>
And , the word <mention> &lsquo; Englisc &lsquo; </mention> was
commonly used as the term for this language .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#41:1>
We often refer to this period as &lsquo; Anglo-Saxon &rsquo; and the
words originated from this period as the &lsquo; Anglo-Saxon &rsquo; words of
the English vocabulary .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#42:1>
According to Jackson &obrack; 1988 , 18 &cbrack; , from this period
until the end of the eleventh century , following the Norman Conquest , is
traditionally called the &lsquo; Old English &rsquo; period of the language .
</p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-001#43:1>
The vocabulary used in everyday conversation which is Old English
origin is frequent .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#44:1>
This is explained by the fact that Anglo-Saxon words are frequently
used , for example , <it> <mention> have </mention> </it> , <it> <mention>
take </mention> </it> or <it> <mention> to </mention> </it> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#45:1>
&obrack; Jackson , 1988 , 23 &cbrack; However , <quote> &ldquo; they
are in a minority as far as the vocabulary of modern English as a whole is
concerned . &ldquo; </quote> &obrack; Jackson , 1988 , 23 &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#46:1>
The word stock of Old English was more Germanic than the English we
use today .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#47:1>
It is observed that many Anglo-Saxon words are <quote> &ldquo;
characteristically associated with a particular stylistic level , namely that
of informality or of colloquial language &ldquo; , </quote> for example ,
<quote> <it> &ldquo; <mention> pluck </mention> , <mention> sweat </mention>
, <mention> guts </mention> , <mention> clothes </mention> , <mention> climb
</mention> , <mention> begin </mention> , <mention> book </mention> ,
<mention> pride </mention> , <mention> lung </mention> &ldquo; , </it>
</quote> etc . &obrack; Jackson , 1988 , 24 &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#48:1>
The word <mention> informality &lsquo; </mention> here demonstrates a
relative concept &longdash;

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#49:1>
those words which we said as &lsquo; informal &rsquo; are informal
when they are compared with their borrowed equivalents &obrack; from French ,
Latin and Greek particularly &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#50:1>
Therefore , we <quote> &ldquo; associate words of Anglo-Saxon origin
with straightforward , direct speaking in face-to-face interaction . &ldquo;
</quote> &obrack; Jackson , 1988 , 23 &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#51:1>
Other common Anglo-Saxon words include : <it> <mention> eat
</mention> , <mention> drink </mention> , <mention> speak </mention> ,
<mention> work house </mention> , <mention> door </mention> , <mention> man
</mention> , <mention> woman </mention> , <mention> husband </mention> ,
<mention> wife </mention> , </it> etc . &obrack; Allen , 1990 , xii &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#52:1>
Most words here are concerned with daily life of common people .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#53:1>
In short , the invasion of Germanic tribes created a basis for the
English word stock and is helpful for us to explain the constituent of
English vocabulary . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-001#54:1>
Another influence on the vocabulary of English as a result of
invasion came from the Danish and other Scandinavian invaders of the ninth
and tenth centuries , collectively called Vikings .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#55:1>
During their period of occupation , many Scandinavian &obrack; Old
Norse &cbrack; words were taken into English .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#56:1>
However , it is sometimes difficult to estimate the influence of Old
Norse because <quote> &ldquo; Old Norse was also a Germanic language , many
words were similar to the Anglo-Saxon ones . &ldquo; </quote> &obrack; Allen
, 1990 , xiii &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#57:1>
Many identifiable Old Norse words are still in use : <it> <mention>
call </mention> , <mention> take </mention> , <mention> law </mention> ,
<mention> leg </mention> , <mention> egg </mention> , <mention> root
</mention> , <mention> window </mention> </it> , place-names such as those
ending in <it> <mention> - thwaite </mention> </it> and <it> <mention> -
thorpe </mention> </it> and in <it> <mention> - by </mention> </it> &obrack;
Grimsby , Rugby , Whitby , and so on &cbrack; , and in street-names ending in
<it> <mention> - gate </mention> </it> &obrack; from the Old Norse <it>
<mention> gata </mention> </it> meaning <mention> &lsquo; street &rsquo;
</mention> &cbrack; such as <it> Coppergate </it> in York . &obrack; Allen ,
1990 , xiii &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#58:1>
However , as pointed out also by Allen in the same book , one very
important effect on English was the gradual disappearance of many
word-endings , or inflections .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#59:1>
This was because , as aforementioned , Anglo-Saxon English words was
very similar to Old Norse words .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#60:1>
But , only the inflections , to a certain extent , hindered their
mutual understanding .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#61:1>
The gradual disappearance of word inflection continued for hw1dreds
of years into Middle English period .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#62:1>
The most important fact here is that the Scandinavian invasion
resulted in implantation of many Old Norse words into English . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-001#63:1>
Another major influence made by invasion happened after 1066 when
William of Normandy defeated the English king , Harold , at the Battle of
Hastings .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#64:1>
The invasion by French-speaking Normans brought <quote> &ldquo; a
transforming Roman influence on the language . &ldquo; </quote> &obrack;
Allen , 1990 , xiii &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#65:1>
The Roman languages included French , Italian , Spanish , Portuguese
, and Romanian .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#66:1>
They have their roots in the spoken Latin .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#67:1>
Many words were borrowed during this period : <it> <mention> infant
</mention> , <mention> commence </mention> , <mention> cordial </mention> ,
<mention> felicity </mention> </it> , etc . &longdash; normally on a <quote>
&ldquo; &lsquo; higher &rsquo; , more formal stylistic level &ldquo; </quote>
&obrack; Jackson , 1988 , 26 &cbrack; than their equivalents in English .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#68:1>
More important aspect is the borrowing of French words to refer
French-dominated areas of life : in law : <it> <mention> justice </mention>
</it> , <it> <mention> jury </mention> </it> , <it> <mention> judgement
</mention> </it> , <it> <mention> estate </mention> </it> , <it> <mention>
equity </mention> </it> , <it> <mention> lease </mention> </it> , <it>
<mention> legacy </mention> </it> , <it> <mention> libel </mention> </it> ,
<it> <mention> perjury </mention> </it> &semi; in gastronomic terms : <it>
<mention> grill </mention> </it> , <it> <mention> fry </mention> </it> , <it>
<mention> stew </mention> </it> , <it> <mention> boil </mention> </it> <it>
and </it> <it> <mention> roast </mention> </it> &semi; in hunting : <it>
<mention> chase </mention> </it> , <it> <mention> quarry </mention> </it> ,
<it> <mention> scent </mention> </it> and <it> <mention> track </mention>
</it> &semi; in nobility terms : <it> <mention> prince </mention> </it> ,
<it> <mention> duke </mention> </it> , <it> <mention> viscount </mention>
</it> and <it> <mention> baron </mention> </it> &semi; and in terms of combat
and chivalry : <it> <mention> courtly </mention> </it> , <it> <mention>
amiable </mention> </it> , <it> <mention> favour </mention> </it> , <it>
<mention> lance </mention> </it> , <it> <mention> generous </mention> </it>
and <it> <mention> enemy </mention> </it> . &obrack; Jackson , 1988 , 26-7
&cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#69:1>
Words derived from French are sometimes recognised by their spelling
, for example , the <it> <mention> - ity </mention> </it> endings of <it>
<mention> felicity </mention> </it> and <it> <mention> equity </mention>
</it> , the <it> <mention> - our </mention> </it> ending of <it> <mention>
favour </mention> </it> , or the <it> <mention> - ant </mention> </it> of
<it> <mention> infant </mention> </it> . &obrack; Jackson , 1988 , 27
&cbrack; </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-001#70:1>
As what Allen &obrack; 1990 , xiv &cbrack; says , <quote> &ldquo;
this mixture of conquering peoples and their languages &longdash; Germanic ,
Scandinavian , and Romance &longdash; has had a decisive effect on the forms
of words in modern English . &ldquo; </quote>

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#71:1>
Many modern English words can be traced back in order to find out
their origins .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#72:1>
They become a member of the English language in their historical
context .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#73:1>
Many example have been just given .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#74:1>
What is worth mentioning again is that these invasions did not only
have effects on politics , they also had effects on culture , religion and
all aspects of social life .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#75:1>
And , language may act as the mirror which can reflect the influence
at that time .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#76:1>
This also applies in the discussion of some other historical events
which are going to be dealt with . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-001#77:1>
There are other historical events related to the explanation of
the constituent of the English vocabulary which seem to be necessary to
mention . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-001#78:1>
When we talk about invasion , we normally refer to its political
implication .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#79:1>
However , invasion can be in terms of culture .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#80:1>
The Renaissance which began at the end of Middle Ages and blossomed
from the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries was of this kind .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#81:1>
At that time , there was a <quote> &ldquo; rediscovery in Europe of
the culture and history of the ancient Greek and Roman worlds &rdquo;
</quote> , and this <quote> &ldquo; exercised a further Romanizing influence
on English . &ldquo; </quote> &obrack; Allen , 1990 , xvi &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#82:1>
The language used by many people who received higher education ,
including scholars , writers , etc , was Latin .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#83:1>
Words such as <it> <mention> arena </mention> </it> , <it> <mention>
dexterity </mention> </it> , <it> <mention> excision </mention> </it> , <it>
<mention> genius </mention> </it> , <it> <mention> habitual </mention> </it>
, <it> <mention> malignant </mention> </it> , <it> <mention> specimen
</mention> </it> and <it> <mention> stimulus </mention> </it> came into the
English language . &obrack; Allen , 1990 , xvi &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#84:1>
There is a tendency to emphasise Greek and Latin origin of words .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#85:1>
This accounts for the <it> <mention> b </mention> </it> in <it>
<mention> debt </mention> </it> , <it> <mention> l </mention> </it> in <it>
<mention> fault </mention> </it> , <it> <mention> s </mention> </it> in <it>
<mention> isle </mention> </it> , <it> <mention> p </mention> </it> in <it>
<mention> receipt </mention> </it> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#86:1>
Other words introduced in this period included <it> <mention>
democratic </mention> </it> , <it> <mention> juvenile </mention> </it> , <it>
<mention> sophisticated </mention> </it> , <it> <mention> imaginary
</mention> </it> , etc . &obrack; Hughes , 1988 , 4 &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#87:1>
This particular historical era demonstrated its effects on the
introduction of many new words into the English language . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-001#88:1>
The development of printing from the fifteenth century might have
a minor effect on English vocabulary .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#89:1>
Many foreign printers used rules of their own languages &obrack; not
English &cbrack; to make the English language more &lsquo; uniform &rsquo; in
spelling . <X>

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#X90:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The unnecessary insertion of h in ghost , for
example , is due to &obrack; William &cbrack; Caxton , &obrack; the first
English printer &cbrack; , and the change had its effect on other words such
as ghastly and &obrack; perhaps &cbrack; ghetto . &ldquo; </quote> </X>
&obrack; Allen . 1990 , xv &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#91:1>
Generally speaking , printing had a major impact on the &lsquo;
standardisation &rsquo; of the form of some English vocabulary .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#92:1>
Moreover , <quote> &ldquo; printing made words more mobile , ......
&obrack; they &cbrack; travelled at speed across continents in books .
&ldquo; </quote> &obrack; Hughes , 1988 , 29 &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#93:1>
Although it did not have a major impact in creating or introducing
new words , it did a great job in the spreading of English vocabulary of
higher uniformity . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-001#94:1>
The rapid development of technology and new sciences in recent
centuries have resulted in the introduction of many technological terms .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#95:1>
Some of them are of Latin or Greek origin .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#96:1>
Others are the result of combination with Germanic .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#97:1>
These words include <mention> <it> bacteriology </it> </mention> ,
<it> <mention> microscope </mention> </it> , <it> <mention> radioactive
</mention> </it> , <it> <mention> semiconductor </mention> </it> , <it>
<mention> software </mention> </it> , <it> <mention> television </mention>
</it> , etc . &obrack; Allen , 1990 , xvi &cbrack; </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-001#98:1>
Of course , there are many other English vocabulary which are
borrowed from other countries in the historical development of the English
language .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#99:1>
For example , <it> <mention> apartheid </mention> </it> &obrack;
Afrikaans &cbrack; , <it> <mention> amok </mention> </it> &obrack; Malay
&cbrack; , <it> <mention> czar </mention> </it> &obrack; Russian &cbrack; ,
<mention> <it> igloo </it> </mention> &obrack; Eskimo &cbrack; , <it>
<mention> Ketchup </mention> </it> , <it> <mention> sampan </mention> </it>
&obrack; Chinese &cbrack; , etc . &obrack; Crystal , 1990 , 38 &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#100:1>
These loanwords may be resulted from the historical interaction of
some kinds between two cultures at a time .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#101:1>
These will not be examined here because it is far more important to
understand the main theme than to know the details here . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-001#102:1>
The section above has dealt with the proposition that events and
eras with specific historical context can be acted as the explainer of the
constituent vocabulary of the English language .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#103:1>
It seems that we can judge whether or not a word is a member of the
English language .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#104:1>
However , one should not be misled by the example given because
those examples reveal only the fact that they are still being used today .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#105:1>
There are a lot more example of words which are totally unfamiliar
to us .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#106:1>
For example , Old English words such as <it> <mention> bl an
</mention> </it> , <it> <mention> caf </mention> </it> , <it> <mention> dugu
</mention> </it> , <mention> <it> f twa </it> </mention> ..... have not
survived at all . &obrack; Pyles and Algeo . 1982 , 110 &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#107:1>
By citing only a few example here can one argue that we cannot
simply explain what the words of a language are just by saying how they got
into the language &obrack; that is , from the historical point of view
&cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#108:1>
There must be some other criteria which may be necessary to
determine whether or not a word is a member of the English language . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-001#109:1>
In the beginning of this essay , I have mentioned that there is
no definite circumference of the English language in terms of vocabulary
&obrack; both number and aspects concerned &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#110:1>
However , there is yet another frontier &longdash; time .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#111:1>
As Murray &obrack; 1888 , 61 &cbrack; says : <quote> the language
presents yet another undefined frontier , when it is viewed in relation to
time ....... <X>

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#X112:1>
It is not to-day what it was a century ago , still less what it
will be a century hence .......

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#X113:1>
&lsquo; Old words &rsquo; are ever becoming obsolete and dying out
: &lsquo; new words &rsquo; are continually pressing in .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#X114:1>
And the death of a word is not an event of which the date can be
readily determined .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#X115:1>
It is a vanishing process ...... </quote> </X> <it> &obrack;

And now we may agree Murray  ' s point that it is not the date
which determines the death of a word .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#117:1>
Rather , it is a vanishing process .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#118:1>
Which thing actually governs the vanishing process ?

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#119:1>
And , more precisely , which words should be included in a
dictionary ? </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-001#120:1>
It is obviously impossible to include all the English words
&obrack; including those emerged in Old English period , Middle English
period and Modern English period &cbrack; in a dictionary &longdash; and it
may not be practical in doing so in at least two ways : first , to involve
all the possible English words may create a set of dictionaries containing
probably more than a hundred volumes .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#121:1>
&obrack; But , this may still be a minor problem . &cbrack; Second ,
to include all English words into a dictionary may lead to problems in the
presentation system of a dictionary .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#122:1>
For example , as it has been mentioned before , Old English words
are highly inflected but Modern English words are not .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#123:1>
This leads to difficulty in the treatment of words of different
periods .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#124:1>
Of course , a third point may be added because there are few people
in the world that would frequently consult words of Old English origin .

<ICE-HK:W1A-001#125:1>
So , it is not very surprising when Murray &obrack; 1888 , 61
&cbrack; says , <quote> &ldquo; practical utility has some bounds , and a
Dictionary has definite limits . &ldquo; </quote> </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-001#126:1>
It becomes very clear that we are turning from English
vocabulary in its historical context to English vocabulary viewed
linguistically within an existing system of explanation . </p> </I>
