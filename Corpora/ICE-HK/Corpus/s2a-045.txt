<ICE-HK:S2A-045#1:1:A>
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#2:1:A>
First I would like to start my speech by pointing out the three
points we have talked about <,> that <,> the twenty-four hour cross uh open
it having open access twenty-four hour <,> uh cross-border <,> it would
encourage the uh the draining of our access

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#3:1:A>
It would encourage uh crime <,> and it would be <,> most importantly
a symbol that Hong Kong has lost control <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#4:1:A>
What do I say about mobility

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#5:1:A>
Look at the property as that we now have in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#6:1:A>
The five star <,> uhm residential the hotel-class so the residential
that you can have if you have the status and all these

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#7:1:A>
They <.> liv </.> people are moving <unc> one word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#8:1:A>
People are moving to China to live

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#9:1:A>
They  ' re having their livelihoods there <,> their businesses there
<,> their their shops there <,> and <.> pe </.> children are going to school
there

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#10:1:A>
These acts they lure they basically lure us to live in China

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#11:1:A>
But however <,> is that something that we should encourage

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#12:1:A>
What is happening here that our our brains are basically being
drained away <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#13:1:A>
Look at Hong Kong that Hong Kong  ' s economy on the other hand

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#14:1:A>
we have recession

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#15:1:A>
Our our upturn of the economy is still slow

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#16:1:A>
We have this impending world trade organization issue

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#17:1:A>
And <,> our opponents have repeatedly said that Hong Kong uh that
China  ' s entry into WTO <,> would be a boom to us all

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#18:1:A>
It would be an asset

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#19:1:A>
However they had been too native

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#20:1:A>
They have never considered the fact that <,> Shanghai <,> that
there  ' re <,> that places like Shanghai that there are many other places in
China <,> that poses real competition for Hong Kong <,> that there are
technicians there <,> that there are university students there who who have
<,> uhm gained a foothold in in in the <.> techno </.> <.> techno </.>
technological sector <,> and that Hong Kong in its present state <,> just is
not up to the competition

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#21:1:A>
And if we do have this twenty-four hour cross uh opening on the
cross-border <,> what would that be a symbol <,> that we are not keeping our
people in and that we are encouraging them out <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#22:1:A>
Besides <,> Hong Kong China already has an international
arbitration center

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#23:1:A>
What makes you think <,> that they are going to <,> uh <?> usualize
</?> Hong Kong  ' s uh <,> legal  ' s uh <,> legal services or the economic
services

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#24:1:A>
Do you think that they are really lagging that behind us <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#25:1:A>
We have to stand <?> out </?> and our ground <,> take <.> reali
</.> reality in our hands and <,> <.> hel </.> <,> bring out the incentive to
keep our people in and not to keep them out

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#26:1:A>
While we  ' re telling people <,> that we are kicking our doors wide
open <,> that because of this more convenience <,> uhm <.> beca </.> uh this
the some these are some of the good points the opponents had been talking
about <,> but they have not been looking at the long-term <,> consequences of
this twenty-four hour cross border open access

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#27:1:A>
And although it is already happening <,> it is no justification <,>
to bring out this <.> m </.> more than a policy change

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#28:1:A>
However <,> why twenty-four hours <,> they  ' ve also not talked
about it

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#29:1:A>
It is although it is already happening <,> do you think that <.>
techni </.> technicians and professionals actually work twenty-hour hours

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#30:1:A>
It is the whole symbolism of its all uh of of these all

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#31:1:A>
The Hong Kong is losing its ground

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#32:1:A>
Next of all I talked about crime

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#33:1:A>
Look at the drug abuse in the discos and the nightclubs over the
border

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#34:1:A>
We are we has we have <unc> two words </unc> <.> s </.>
smuggling in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#35:1:A>
Cars and fake goods all over the border

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#36:1:A>
We have <,> uh a serious prostitution problem from over the border

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#37:1:A>
Pirated CDs which sell like hot cakes <,> uh over in the Shenzhen
Commercial Center

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#38:1:A>
What do these tell us

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#39:1:A>
What are we telling the public if we have open assess <,> that we
are opening doors to them <,> that it is <,> uh that despite we take the
pride of upholding the security of the border <,> that we are actually
bleaching it <,> that despite we  ' re upholding values of intellectual
property <,> that we are crack <,> we are making crack down on the illegal
and infringing goods <.> s </.> we are actually letting our people having
more more and everything as they like at anytime of the day

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#40:1:A>
Besides <.> tha </.> what have I been saying <,> the Hong Kong this
that having this open access is not about a matter of <,> businessmen having
twenty- four hours to go over the border <,> or technicians having
twenty-four hours to come over this side

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#41:1:A>
It is it  ' s symbolism <,> of that <,> Hong Kong has no longer any
true control over it over the flow of its uh of people across its border

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#42:1:A>
Look at this <,> after nineteen ninety seven <,> Hong Kong has
resumed sovereignty under China

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#43:1:A>
We should be under a system of one country two systems

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#44:1:A>
However <,> our opponents <,> <.> j </.> just focus on the one
country bit

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#45:1:A>
However <,> if we don't look at the two systems bit <,> what sense
does it make of this <,> one country two systems uh policy

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#46:1:A>
Think of it <,> uhm <,> they <.> ha </.> although they had quoted
the basic law to us saying that Hong Kong is an <.> alienal </.> an alienable
part of China

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#47:1:A>
Have they looked to the preamble of the basic law and the
Sino-Joint Declaration <,> which says that Hong Kong should maintain its
independence and autonomy

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#48:1:A>
However <,> what do we have now

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#49:1:A>
Hong Kong has has shown this image to the uh to to foreigners <,>
that we had been losing our autonomy and independence because of increasing
intervention by <,> China <,> uh whether it  ' s by legally that they have
intervened by interpreting our basic law and <,> such what

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#50:1:A>
One people are so sensitive about the very real threat of Chinese
intervention into Hong Kong affairs in whatever matter

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#51:1:A>
Are we going to risk this very negative implication of open access

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#52:1:A>
There is <,> there may be a demand but there  ' s no such a need

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#53:1:A>
There  ' s no wide-spread justification <,> for this twenty-four hour
<,> and I can tell you that they have not wait <,> the implications between
<,> and so therefore this motion must stand

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#54:1:A>
Thank you </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-045#55:2:A>
Madame speaker <,> honorable adjudicators <,> members of this
house <,> good afternoon

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#56:2:A>
The common ground of today  ' s debate <,> is that we both believe
the HKSAR should formulate its policies <,> to serve her citizens <,> to the
fullest

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#57:2:A>
And we also believe that we still have a border <,> running through
Hong Kong and Shenzhen <,> but what we disagree on is whether the twenty-four
<,> border-crossing will <.> se </.> satisfy the general citizens  '  needs to
the greatest

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#58:2:A>
We <,> on the negative side <,> believe that it will based on the
philosophical economic and feasibility aspects <,> and which will be further
<.> e </.> <.> re </.> reiterated by me at the end of my speech

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#59:2:A>
But right now <,> let  ' s just go <,> deeply into what the fatal
fallacies that the other side has made today

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#60:2:A>
The other side has based their whole line of argument <,> on a lot
of assumptions

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#61:2:A>
Assumption number one <,> they said that this policy is only for
the personal convenience and not for and not for the betterment of the whole
society <,> but we say it  ' s not true <,> because we believe that it  ' s
beneficial to both <.> con </.> for personal convenience as well as the whole
economy

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#62:2:A>
They quoted to us the property market <,> and then we say that they
have mistakenly put an equal sign <,> between the quality of the housing in
Hong Kong as well as in China

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#63:2:A>
We we say that definitely not true because Hong Kong <,> has
definitely a better quality in terms of infrastructure <,> standard of living
<,> and we definitely had a better <.> me </.> medical care

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#64:2:A>
And all these are some crucial concerns when people choose where to
live <,> and then they simply assume that more people will go up there

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#65:2:A>
Well let  ' s look at from let  ' s look at the issue from another
angle

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#66:2:A>
If really if really people want to move up somewhere in China to
live in <,> then would this policy <?> will </?> provide them more choices
<,> because <,> right now in Hong Kong the rental <,> cost and the investment
cost is too high and we say it  ' s not reasonable <,> and then would this
policy on one hand we can benefit businessmen and in turn it will boost our
economy <,> and on the other hand <,> we can help the grass-root people <,>
to get housing <,> and realize their dreams

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#67:2:A>
Now we say that the affirmative side definitely do not know what
<.> pe </.> Hong Kong people really need

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#68:2:A>
They definitely do not know how <,> to formulate public policy <,>
to enhance communication and economic prosperity

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#69:2:A>
And we say that the twenty-four hour cross-border is necessary and
it  ' s a genuine need

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#70:2:A>
Now the second <,> assumption <,> they they suggested that well
that twenty-four hour crossing it will <.> in </.> increase the intellectual
property infringement and crime rate but <,> we on this side of the house
believe that it  ' s it  ' s not true because <,> intellectual property
infringement and crime rate simply <,> are not caused by the operating hours
<,> of the borders

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#71:2:A>
The extension of working hours simply do not <.> exacer </.>
exacerbate the problems

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#72:2:A>
There simply is no <.> re </.> correlation <,> between these two
things

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#73:2:A>
And then assumption number three that they have made <,> they
assume that <,> this policy <,> this practice in is infeasible <,> and is
cost <.> in </.> ineffective <,> but we say <,> that <,> this is not true as
already defeat this point is already defeated by our speakers <,> since we
provided you that the alternatives say the smartcard

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#74:2:A>
It will not increase the manpower

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#75:2:A>
It will not <,> waste our resources <,> because we  ' ve also quoted
the some <,> uhm successful examples from other countries <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#76:2:A>
The assumption number four that they have made <,> they presume
that <,> the China  ' s accession <,> to the WTO <,> is detrimental to Hong
Kong <,> but we say <,> that  ' s not true <,> because we can create a win-win
situation <,> in both Hong Kong and China <,> because Hong Kong can provide
the hi-tech hi-tech hi-tech to uhm expertise and knowledge to China and we
Hong Kong have already established a long history <,> in terms of these areas
<,> and then <,> while China can provide the Hong Kong businessmen lower cost
of production

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#77:2:A>
We simply can gain from both sides <,> and then we say that
economic ties will become closer <,> and this is precisely explained in our
economic point

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#78:2:A>
The assumption number five that they have made <,> they said that
this policy simply cannot fulfill the one country two system premises but we
say <,> that this system can enhance the philosophy of having a unifying
country and on the other hand the two systems can also be <,> uh maintained
because the <.> ci </.> citizens <,> still have to cross the borders they
still have to <,> have to uh custom check and we still have a different legal
system

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#79:2:A>
Now our side  ' s arguments are so self-evident and concrete while
their uh side their side  ' s arguments are so <unc> several words
</unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#80:2:A>
They  ' ve been <.> exagger </.> exaggerating <,> things if not
fabricating it

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#81:2:A>
Now what our side has told you today <,> is that <,> this policy is
good to Hong Kong <,> based on the <.> philosocal </.> philosophical and
economic as well as the <?> feasibility </?> points of views

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#82:2:A>
And these are all beautifully presented to you <,> by my speakers
<,> my captain <,> my second speaker <,> and third speaker

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#83:2:A>
We say that this policy is good and we are proud to stand against
it

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#84:2:A>
Let  ' s <,> I hope you <,> see the same light

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#85:2:A>
Thank you </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-045#86:3:A>
If only <,> guests adjudicators <,> my friendly opponents if
only <,> we have so many resources if only we have so much manpower if only
the relationship between Hong Kong and China <,> is so ideal <,> then we
don't even need to bother the future

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#87:3:A>
But we <,> know that having today  ' s motion <,> that twenty-four
hour border crossing with Shenzhen will do more harm than good <,> for Hong
Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#88:3:A>
It  ' s <,> involves a balancing act

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#89:3:A>
They will know there are complications in policy considerations and
we cannot be so naïve <,> as to think that being <,> having more convenience
we can have more benefits <,> so let  ' s go ahead and do it <,> and forget
about the cost

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#90:3:A>
Well we <,> stress today <,> that the motion stresses on <,> to
Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#91:3:A>
The three words is crucial <,> in the <?> crust </?> of today  ' s
debate <,> therefore an analyzing whether <,> we should open the borders <,>
for the whole day we should see whether how <,> it impacts Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#92:3:A>
And we say that of course we sympathies with you <,> our negative
side because we want everybody to be hand in hand

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#93:3:A>
Of course China and Hong Kong we  ' re one family <,> why don't we
cooperate <,> but we say <,> that the one country two systems <,> is inherent
<,> in <,> the uhm policy of Hong Kong and that  ' s the whole purpose of the
basic law

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#94:3:A>
It  ' s to maintain the economic competitiveness of Hong Kong <,> so
that it can continue to prosper in the future <,> and <?> down </?> my line
of speakers they have already shown you <,> how there can be harms <,> how
can there can be risks <,> arising from having an open border for the whole
day

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#95:3:A>
And we say that <,> going through the border is not like an Octopus
card

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#96:3:A>
We don't just go beep and then we can pass into Shenzhen <,> and
come back whatever time we want

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#97:3:A>
There are other considerations and sometimes <,> inconvenience
justifies it

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#98:3:A>
So <,> how have we been weighing this motion so far <,> the
negative have not for one time <,> told us <,> why it should be twenty-four
hours not twenty-three hours <,> not even not opening the border <,> but
total complete open border to the mainland

<ICE-HK:S2A-045#99:3:A>
And what <,> magnitude of benefit <,> it will arise for Hong Kong
</I>
