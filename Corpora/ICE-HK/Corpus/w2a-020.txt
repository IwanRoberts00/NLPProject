<bold> Public Consultation and Planning </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#2:1>
<ul> <bold> Introduction </bold> </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#3:1>
Hong Kong  '  s existing planning system which operates under the
Town Planning ordinance &obrack; Cap. 131 &cbrack; enacted in 1939 , had no
fundamental changes until the passage of the Town Planning &obrack; Amendment
&cbrack; Ordinance 1991 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#4:1>
With the significant social , economic and political changes in the
past decades , a comprehensive review on the ordinance which guides the
operation of the system is definitely needed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#5:1>
The recent consultative document on the Comprehensive Review on the
Comprehensive Review of the Town Planning Ordinance provides a good
opportunity for public consultation in the formulation of a more responsive
planning system to meet the needs of the changing environment . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#6:1>
<ul> <bold> Principles and Objectives of Planning </bold> </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#7:1>
Basically , the objective of planning is to optimize the use of
available land and resources to meet the needs of a community .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#8:1>
More exactly it is to enhance social and economic development and to
promote environmental improvement .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#9:1>
Actors in the planning process normally include government officials ,
private developers and citizens .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#10:1>
Although the ultimate goal of creating a healthy living environment
may be agreeable by all parties concerned , their priorities and interests
are significantly different .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#11:1>
For instance , government planners may wish to meet the shortfall of
required public facilities in a district in a cost-effective way .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#12:1>
Private developers are interested primarily in profit maximization in
the shortest time .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#13:1>
The public may their interests on neighbourhood improvement , and
those affected by the development may want to get the most from compensation
and resettlement .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#14:1>
In pursuing their priorities and interests , private developers
usually have the financial capacities to influence the government in the
planning process .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#15:1>
As for community residents , they have neither the financial means
nor the professional expertise to influence the plan .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#16:1>
Hence , the consultation process must be made economical and easily
comprehensible to the general public . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#17:1>
In a democratic society , a planning system should not only
promote public interest but also protect individual right .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#18:1>
An ideal planning system should be fair , flexible , predictable ,
and affordable .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#19:1>
Since the interest and objectives of various parties involved in the
planning and development processes are different and even conflicting
sometimes , striking a balance among them is a very important issue . </p>
<h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#20:1>
<ul> <bold> Citizen Participation in Planning </bold> </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#21:1>
In the politics of planning , power is crucial in determining who
gets what , and where , when and how to get them .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#22:1>
Unlike private developers , the general public have little resources
or power to influence planning and development .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#23:1>
Their interests and needs are often neglected. The introduction of
citizen participation is a way of ensuring that those affected development ,
or conservation , on the other hand , will have a fair treatment in the
process .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#24:1>
More specifically , to what extent citizen participation will
influence the outcome of the planning process depends very much on the
content , timing and means of participation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#25:1>
Form the citizen  ' s perspective , a genuine and meaningful
participation should be substantive and should begin at an early stage of the
plan preparation process .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#26:1>
The means should be simple and easily understood and the venue should
be convenient to all .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#27:1>
Ideally , any affected person should have direct and continuing
opportunities to participate in the planning process . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#28:1>
At present in Hong Kong , a development decision are often made
by developers and government officials instead of affected residents ,
benefits usually accrue to the community at large or the former rather than
the latter .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#29:1>
As such , problems may arise in the implementation stage of a project
when aggrieved residents demand excessive and unreasonable compensation which
may delay or inhibit the development .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#30:1>
This may adversely affect public interest and frustrate the
opportunities or economic development and environmental improvement .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#31:1>
Hence , consultation at the early stage of planning will enhance
better understanding and cooperation among residents , developers and
government officials and reduce conflicts in the implementation stage . </p>
<h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#32:1>
<ul> <bold> The Comprehensive Review of the Town Planning Ordinance
</bold> </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#33:1>
The comprehensive review of the Town Planning Ordinance aims to
update the planning system in meeting the changing social , economics , and
political conditions in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#34:1>
It covers many aspects such as the plan-making process , planning
applications , development control , compensation and betterment , areas of
special control , non-conforming existing uses and other issues .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#35:1>
The following sections focus on the public consultation aspect in the
plan-making process and planning applications . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#36:1>
<it> <bold> &dash; Plan-making process </bold> </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#37:1>
Problems of the existing plan-making process are <-> manifolds
</-> <+> manifold </+> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#38:1>
Insufficient public participation is one of the main complaints .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#39:1>
Apart from the consultation with relevant district boards which is
not statutorily required under the existing Ordinance , there is no provision
for public consultation before a plan is prepared . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#40:1>
In the proposed new plan-making process , the introduction of
planning study in preparation of a draft plan is a step forward to
incorporate public consultation at an early stage of the process .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#41:1>
However , since the results of planning studies may involve come
complicated issues , the suggested two-month public inspection and comments
period is not flexible .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#42:1>
It is recommended to have a range between two to six months
consultation period depending on the complexity of the issues and subject to
the Planning Authority  ' s discretion .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#43:1>
In the proposed new process , it states that the planning Board
&obrack; PB &cbrack; should take into account of the results and findings of
planning studies , public opinions received , and relevant government
policies in drawing up detailed planning proposals .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#44:1>
However , no one know show public opinions , comments from public
authorities or local bodies are to be incorporated into the draft plan if the
PB papers are not open to public .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#45:1>
Besides , the proposed two-month period for comments is considered
inadequate .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#46:1>
Since any objections, comments or suggestions to the draft plan need
more detailed studies and preparation, three-month period for public
inspection should be given . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#47:1>
Surprisingly in the plan-making process , the territorial
development strategies and sub-regional plans are excluded from any form of
public consultation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#48:1>
As these plans may be similar to planning studies but in a macro
scale , it would be useful for these two types of plans to have some form of
public consultation as well .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#49:1>
On the other hand , the draft and approved plans should be deposited
for public inspection in local district offices , and the Planning Department
in addition to the Land Office . </p> <it> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#50:1>
<bold> &dash; Planning Applications </bold> </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#51:1>
The Review claims that the existing procedures for planning
applications operate rather efficiently and flexibly .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#52:1>
However , there are still &semi; some problems regarding public
involvement and appeals in the process .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#53:1>
The proposed publication of planning applications for public
inspection is a very good way of making certain adverse effects of a proposed
development known to residents in the vicinity of the site .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#54:1>
Nonetheless , there is still a question regarding whether all
planning applications should be publishes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#55:1>
Apart form the two listed options , i.e. publishing all planning
applications or allowing PB the discretion power to decide which to be
published , there might be a third one which strikes the balance between the
two .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#56:1>
More precisely , some specific guidelines for the types of planning
applications which need no publications should be given .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#57:1>
For those non-published planning applications , they should be
registered and made available for public inspection .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#58:1>
Moreover , applicants should be given reasons for refusal of the
planning applications so that they can decide whether to appeal or not . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#59:1>
The establishment of an independent planning Appeal Board
&obrack; AB &cbrack; is a very sound move towards ensuring fairness in the
planning process .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#60:1>
The composition and operation of the AB is of paramount importance .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#61:1>
The appointments of members to the AB should reflect a wide spectrum
of people with professional expertise but without vested interests .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#62:1>
As suggested , all the general principles of a hearing should be
adopted . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#63:1>
The proposed new ordinance requires the prior consent or
knowledge of the land owner a property before a planning application is made .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#64:1>
It might be useful to spell out the circumstances under which
obtaining a written consent of the owner is necessary , while other
circumstances under which serving a notice on the owner would be accepted
because it may not be feasible to obtain the consent of absentee of decreased
owners .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#65:1>
It may be suffice to require the applicant to demonstrate a
reasonable act in this regard . </p> </I>

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#66:2>
<bold> Marine Insurance Claims &dash Onus of Proof </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#67:2>
<it> by Raymond Wong </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#68:2>
It is a general rule of law that the burden of proof is upon the
party making a claim or making an assertion to prove that their allegation is
correct .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#69:2>
The word &lsquo; <mention> burden </mention> &rsquo; in these
circumstances means responsibility and it is the responsibility of the party
making the claim to produce evidence which is sufficient to establish the
validity of the claim . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#70:2>
In order to discharge the burden of proof , the Assured does not
have to exclude all possibilities as to how the particular damage has
occurred but he is merely required to demonstrate that the balance of
probabilities is in favour of an accidental loss by perils insured against .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#71:2>
Since it is his responsibility to prove his case , if a particular
loss is equally likely to have been caused by a peril not covered by the
policy , then the Assured will have failed to discharge the burden of proof .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#72:2>
Two interesting cases demonstrating that it is the balance of
probabilities which much be looked to are the cases of <it> Munro Brice
&ampersand; Co. v. Marten &obrack; 1920 &cbrack; </it> and <it> Cia. Maritima
of Barcelona v. Wishart &obrack; 1918 &cbrack; </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#73:2>
In the former case a vessel was lost during wartime .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#74:2>
There was no evidence brought forward to show that any particularly
serious heavy weather had occurred at the relevant time in the area where the
vessel was operating , but evidence was to hand that an enemy submarine had
been active in such area .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#75:2>
Under these circumstances , the Assured failed to prove that the
vessel had been lost by perils of the sea .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#76:2>
In the second case mentioned above , however , evidence was produced
that weather of some severity had occurred at the relevant time and the
Assured succeeded in proving , on the balance of probabilities , that the
vessel had been lost as a result of such heavy weather . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#77:2>
Various statements summarising the position regarding the burden
of proof can be found in the case of the &ldquo; <it> POPI M </it> &rdquo;
&obrack; <it> Rhesa Shipping Co. Ltd. v. Edmunds &ampersand; Fenton Insurance
Co. Ltd &dash; 1985 &cbrack; </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#78:2>
The facts of this case were that a 26 year old vessel , the &ldquo;
POPI M &rdquo; was proceeding through the Mediterranean in calm seas when a
gap suddenly developed in the shell plating in way of the engine room and ,
as a result of the incursion of seawater , the vessel sank .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#79:2>
In his judgement , Lord Brandon made the following comments: <X>
<quote> &ldquo  '  The first matter is that the burden of proving , on a
balance of probabilities , that the ship was lost by perils of the sea , is
and remains throughout on the shipowners .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#X80:2>
Although it is open to underwriters to suggest and seek to prove
some other cause of loss , against which the ship was not insured , there is
no obligation on them to prove , even on a balance of probabilities , the
truth of their alternative case. &rdquo; </quote> and <quote> &ldquo; The
shipowners failed to establish that the ship was seaworthy and they only put
forward an extremely improbable cause of her loss .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#X81:2>
In these circumstances , the Judge should have found that the true
cause of the loss was in doubt , and that the shipowners had failed to
discharge the burden of proof which was on them . &rdquo; </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#82:2>
Lord Brandon also quoted in the course of his judgement the
following dictum of Scrutton L.J. in the case of <it> La Compania Martiartu
v. The Corporation of The Royal Exchange Assurance &obrack; 1923 &cbrack;
</it> IKB 650 , as follows: <X> <quote> &ldquo; If there are circumstances
suggesting that another cause of the entry of sea water into the shop ... and
an examination of all the evidence leaves the Court doubtful what is the real
cause of the loss , the assured has failed to prove his case .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#X83:2>
&rdquo; </X> </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#84:2>
Once the Assured has made out a prima facie case that the loss or
damage has occurred as a result of a peril insured against , the onus then
shifts to the Underwriters to set up a counter-argument that the loss or
damage occurred as a result of a peril not insured against or to prove the
privity of the Assured , a breach of warranty or that the loss or damage
comes within the terms of an exceptions clause . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#85:2>
The onus of proof may vary according to the nature of a
particular case .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#86:2>
For instance , where the Assured is claiming for a loss by perils of
the sea , the onus is on him to prove that the loss was accidental .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#87:2>
It is clear from various legal judgements that , if the loss is
equally likely to have been sustained as a result of perils of the sea and
scuttling , the claim fails .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#88:2>
If the Assured , however , is claiming for a loss by fire the same
principles do not apply , since fire is deemed to cover not only accidental
fire but also fire deliberately caused .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#89:2>
Once the Assured has demonstrated therefore that the loss or damage
has arisen as a result of fire , whether or not deliberately caused .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#90:2>
The onus is then on Underwriters to prove that the Assured himself
was privy to the occurrence of the fire .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#91:2>
This is clear from the judgement <it> Slattary v. Mance &obrack; 1962
&cbrack; </it> . </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#95:3>
The International Convention on Salvage , 1989 was adopted on
28th April 1989 like any other international convention , will take several
years for the required 15 states ratify it before the Convention enters into
force . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#96:3>
The major changes in the Convention have been incorporated into
the L 0 F 1990 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#97:3>
This new Lloyd  ' s Standard Form of Salvage Agreement was published on
the 5th September 1990 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#98:3>
The majority of the world  ' s salvage services will now be performed
under the L O F 1990 which includes Articles 13 and 14 of the 1989 Salvage
Convention . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#99:3>
The Convention Article 13 sets out the criteria for fixing a
salvage remuneration which includes <quote> &ldquo; the skill and efforts of
the salvors in preventing or minimizing damage to the environment &rdquo;
</quote> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#100:3>
An award made taking into account this factor is referred to as an
&lsquo; enhanced &rsquo; award as if the tribunal was adding on a specific
sum to what it would otherwise have awarded . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#101:3>
The special compensation provisions under the Convention Article
14 is an adaptation of the &lsquo; safety net &rsquo; concept described as
&ldquo; the exception to the principle of no cure - no pay &rdquo; initiated
by Lloyd  ' s in L 0 F 1980 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#102:3>
Under L 0 F 1980 , the &lsquo; safety net &rsquo; principle would
apply if all the following conditions were satisfied:

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#103:3>
1. The ship being salved must be a tanker laden or partly laden with
a cargo oil , fuel oil , heavy diesel oil or lubricating oil.

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#104:3>
2. The contractor , his servants or agents , endeavouring to prevent
the escape of oil while performing the salvage services , must not have been
guilty of any negligence.

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#105:3>
3. The services must have been unsuccessful , only partially
successful , or brought to an end by the intervention of a third party . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#106:3>
At that time , two situations were envisaged . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#107:3>
Firstly , a completely unsuccessful operation :

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#108:3>
The Salvor became entitled to reasonably incurred expenses and a
bonus , which would be at the Arbitrator  ' s discretion which would not exceed
15&percent; of the out-of-pocket expenses . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#109:3>
Secondly , a partially successful operation :

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#110:3>
Where the Salvor received a property award as against that part of
the property which he saved , but which award did not cover his expenses .

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#111:3>
In these circumstances , the Salvor would be entitled to receive a
further payment so that his total remuneration would cover his expenses plus
a bonus &obrack; not exceeding 15 &percent; of his expense &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-020#112:3>
L 0 F 1990 which adopts the safety net rules updated in the 1989
Salvage Convention , differs from L 0 F 1980 in that : &dash;

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#113:3>
a. the safety net or special compensation applies not only to laden
oil tanker cases but also to any situation where the ship or cargo threatens
damage to the environment , and

<ICE-HK:W2A-020#114:3>
b. the increment will be up to 30&percent; of expense , with a
maximum of 100&percent; </p> </I>
