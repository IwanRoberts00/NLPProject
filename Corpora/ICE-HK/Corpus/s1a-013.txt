<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-013#1:1:A>
Simplicity <.> sim </.> simple way of solving out problem <{>
<[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#2:1:A>
Uh we we do see the problem in China but it doesn't mean that uh if
we turn to the other side that will be the solution forever <X>

<$Z> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X3:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X4:1:Z>
No <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> and there must be a Hong Kong way

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X5:1:Z>
<{2> <[2> A third way of doing things </[2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-013#6:1:A>
<[1> Ha </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#7:1:A>
<[2> Ha ha ha ha ha ha </[2> </{2> of seeing things or doing things

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X8:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-013#9:1:A>
Uh you you cannot pretend that you are you are not a Hong Kong
person and and than you can actually easily change to to another other kind

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X10:1:Z>
But I just you know if we just ignore <{1> <[1> this </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X11:1:Z>
Just uhm and just ignore it because uhm you know again because I
realise that in the Danish papers <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> Hong Kong gets so
little <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> these little you  ' ve seen <{4> <[4> <&> laughter
</&> and I </[4> and I I uh two years ago I made I I wrote a long article
about Hong Kong but and they the paper I wrote for accepted it but a few
months later they told me that no actually they couldn't use it because they
had their own experts <{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X12:1:Z>
And that that sort of infuriated me because uhm I never read in
Danish papers about Hong Kong so what are these experts <{6> <[6> doing and
writing about </[6> it

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X13:1:Z>
So I think uhm may be okay Hong Kong is quite interesting for for
Denmark <{7> <[7> but </[7> its you know it  ' s interesting for the world and
it  ' s a it  ' s a unique <{8> <[8> situation

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X14:1:Z>
All these things </[8>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X15:1:Z>
As therefore I want to uhm you know again as you said before write
about Hong Kong <{9> <[9> inside </[9> and therefore find the people who who
can tell me about <{10> <[10> this </[10>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X16:1:Z>
Uhm concerning about things I can only see the surface <{11> <[11>
<,> </[11>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X17:1:Z>
Uh so that  ' s and my intention is to to again give a a uhm to like
do a portrait of the city but from <{12> <[12> <,> uh from </[12> yeah from a
person who has the language and the sensitivity and the knowledge <{13> <[13>
<,> </[13> uh you know all those things

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X18:1:Z>
Since after reading this <{14> <[14> uhm </[14> I knew that it
would be you </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-013#19:1:A>
<[1> Ha ha ha </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#20:1:A>
<[2> Ha </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#21:1:A>
<[3> Yeah </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#22:1:A>
<[4> Yes I have

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#23:1:A>
Don't worry </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#24:1:A>
<[5> I see </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#25:1:A>
<[6> Ha ha ha ha </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#26:1:A>
<[7> Ha ha </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#27:1:A>
<[8> Uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm </[8> </{8>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#28:1:A>
<[9> Uhm uhm </[9> </{9>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#29:1:A>
<[10> Uhm uhm uhm </[10> </{10>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#30:1:A>
<[11> Uhm uhm </[11> </{11>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#31:1:A>
<[12> Uhm uhm a certain perspective </[12> </{12>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#32:1:A>
<[13> Uhm </[13> </{13>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#33:1:A>
<[14> Yeah </[14> </{14>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#34:1:A>
I don't know

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#35:1:A>
I don't know

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#36:1:A>
Uh let let  ' s not worry about the outcome <{> <[> but just talk I
mean I  ' ll be glad </[> to talk to you about it since you  ' re concern and
interested in it

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X37:1:Z>
<[> No no yeah yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X38:1:Z>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X39:1:Z>
Well do you do you think that there is or do you find that there
is uhm like an urgency among uhm Hong Kong Chinese writers artists to to make
this cultural statement uh before ninety-seven

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X40:1:Z>
Is that more happening now </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-013#41:1:A>
Yeah I think it  ' s more happening now

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#42:1:A>
I mean uh actually in uhm <.> s </.> since eighty-two or
eighty-four between <{1> <[1> the </[1> the the the so-called Sino-British uh
<{2> <[2> negotiation </[2> uh the issue of ninety-seven uh is brought to the
table

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#43:1:A>
Of course that uh arouse a lot of <{3> <[3> anxiety </[3> and and
and so on

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#44:1:A>
But also for the local artists I think it seems that they  ' re they  ' re
more alert to the issue and have feel more of this urgency <{4> <[4> to </[4>
to speak up before ninety-seven

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#45:1:A>
<{5> <[5> <,> So </[5> for example in the field of theatre there
there there were plays like uh I  ' m a Hong Kongese things like that

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#46:1:A>
I mean you can tell from the title <{6> <[6> <,> uh </[6> I  ' m a
Hong Kongese uh Hong Kong on stage uh trilogy about Hong Kong that kind of
work being done uh by local artists in order to look back at the Hong Kong
history <{7> <[7> and among the <unc> a few words </unc> </[7>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X47:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X48:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X49:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X50:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X51:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X52:1:Z>
<[6> Yeah </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X53:1:Z>
<[7> Uhm is that a political theatre </[7> </{7> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-013#54:1:A>
Uh political theatre yes uh but also even on a on a on a
broadest broadest sense I mean even for uhm <&> tut </&> you know about the
Hong Kong Rep

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#55:1:A>
I mean it  ' s a not a very good theatre group

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#56:1:A>
It  ' s the government-run <{1> <[1> <,> Hong </[1> Kong Repertory

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#57:1:A>
But even for for popular theatre like that they they will
eventually feel may be under pressure may be because the audience want to see
they want to to do something along the line as well <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#58:1:A>
They I think it <unc> a-few-words </unc> varieties I mean
you on one hand we have street performance like people like <?> Alders </?>
Ma uh uh <?> Alders </?> Mok who who who who who do the street performances
and so forth

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#59:1:A>
Or he for example translated uh Dario Fo  ' s Tiger and and and and
and put it up in in various centres to perform it <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#60:1:A>
But on other hand there are also uhm uh uh scripts about uh Hong
Kong situation uh political or on a more like daily level about life in Hong
Kong <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#61:1:A>
I think that there is this urgency to to suddenly because you see
there is something in front of you as if a person is knowing that he  ' s going
to die uh to exaggerate a little bit like he  ' s going to be to to die for
cancer or <{4> <[4> something </[4> then you suddenly look back at yourself
<{5> <[5> and </[5> examine what who am I and and what have I done <{6> <[6>
that </[6> kind of things

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#62:1:A>
So in general there seem to be this this this concern or this need
to reflect upon <,> the the the the whole situation perceive the history the
cultural identity

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X63:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X64:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X65:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X66:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X67:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X68:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X69:1:Z>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X70:1:Z>
But I I understood that  ' s uhm after eighty-nine <{1> <[1> <,> it
became </[1> more difficult to uhm to publish creative works <{2> <[2> <,> in
</[2> Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X71:1:Z>
I mean </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-013#72:1:A>
<[1> Ha ha </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#73:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-013#74:1:A>
For example I I I I used to get my works published with no
problem although although is not that easy <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> for example
poetry is not that <{2> <[2> easy to </[2> to to to to get published but uh
one way or another I mean after some difficulties uh books will be published

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#75:1:A>
But after eighty-nine I I had counter that kinds of difficulties
because it  ' s it  ' s not that obvious on the surface <{3> <[3> uh </[3> for
example there will be some uh small press or some literary press but
eventually may be they will turn to uh publish books for educational purpose
or for <{4> <[4> entertainment </[4> or or for other things

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#76:1:A>
Or small press that close down because of financial problems or
<{5> <[5> so </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#77:1:A>
People who have money to invest wanted to make uh short-term return
<.> short </.> short-term uhm return of <{6> <[6> money </[6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#78:1:A>
Uh that they did not want to invest on long-term business <{7> <[7>
<,> </[7> so they want to get their money back as soon as possible <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#79:1:A>
Uh in that case they would not like to invest in literature that
kinds of things

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#80:1:A>
So they would like to publish more practical things

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#81:1:A>
The big publishers then they publish books weekly

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#82:1:A>
But they will publish like books about dogs flowers <&>
Z's-unclear-speech </&> that kind of books of course not poetry

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#83:1:A>
Uh I have actually I have three <.> ma </.> uh manuscript of uh I
have three novels you  ' ll see which are in <{8> <[8> manuscript </[8> and
still very difficult to get published

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#84:1:A>
So <{9> <[9> it  ' s </[9> getting more difficult

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X85:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X86:1:Z>
<[2> Yah yah yah </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X87:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X88:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X89:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X90:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X91:1:Z>
<[7> Yeah </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X92:1:Z>
<[8> Uhm </[8> </{8>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X93:1:Z>
<[9> Have you </[9> </{9>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X94:1:Z>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X95:1:Z>
Have you given them to publishers and </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-013#96:1:A>
Well actually in one case a publisher promised to publish the
the the novel but then he uh he uh the publisher closed down in a way

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#97:1:A>
It  ' s it  ' s it  ' s uh inactive now

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#98:1:A>
So the the publishing company is is not <.> ac </.> active in
publishing new books so uh it stay there for a while and I guess it just will
not publish <{1> <[1> books </[1> but it  ' s not going to publish any more
literature <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#99:1:A>
In other cases I mean there there there there there are not not I I
don't find any uh suitable publisher at at the meantime so so I don't see any
any any changes <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> unless things will change in the <{4>
<[4> near future </[4>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X100:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X101:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X102:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X103:1:Z>
<[4> Yeah </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X104:1:Z>
Cos on on the other hand you you sort of think that uhm in in a
time like this <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> people needs writers to express <{2> <[2>
<,> yeah to uh </[2> <{3> <[3> to describe or </[3> <{4>
<[4 confirm or console  </[4> <{5> <[5> uhm </[5> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-013#105:1:A>
<[1> Ha ha </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#106:1:A>
<[2> For that timing </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#107:1:A>
<[3> Yah yeah yeah </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#108:1:A>
<[4> Uhm uhm uhm </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#109:1:A>
<[5> Yah Yah </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#110:1:A>
I we yeah we actually feel that need to express <{1> <[1> and
</[1> talk about it

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#111:1:A>
And I can see from other ways I mean even for example in a in a
gathering the uh the memory of the June Fourth Incident for example the
people will tend to think of a song to sing

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#112:1:A>
You you want to sing a song in order to express <{2> <[2> yourself
</[2> or you want to to recite some some poem or <{3> <[3> or </[3> something

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#113:1:A>
So so in in that case it seems that people need that kind of
expression through <{4> <[4> language </[4> <.> artis </.> artistic uh
creation but on the other hand in in general I mean the the the the
atmosphere seem to be very seem to be more more and more practical that <?>
that people </?> would like to earn big sum of money and then leave Hong Kong
<{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#114:1:A>
For the businessmen I mean that is the very common mentality <{6>
<[6> <,> so </[6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#115:1:A>
You know Hong Kong is uhm <&> tut </&> for for so many years there
there isn't a a cultural policy in Hong Kong to support publications <{7>
<[7> <,> </[7> I mean from the government

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#116:1:A>
I mean in recent years they have put money on the field of
performances

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#117:1:A>
I mean the the the the they have support uh theatre dance that
kind of performance

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#118:1:A>
They have put money into it

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#119:1:A>
But they have not really support the the field of literature <{8>
<[8> <,> </[8> so there wasn't any actual support publication uh other kinds
of things that in connection with literature <{9> <[9> <,> </[9>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#120:1:A>
I guess in the in the in the early days the colonial government
was more worry about written things I mean you you tend be reflexive as you
may write about sensitive <{10> <[10> issues </[10> things like that

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#121:1:A>
For performance they tend to turn it into entertainment <{11>
<[11> that </[11> is harmless <{12> <[12> <,> </[12>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#122:1:A>
If you see if you go to see a play a <{13> <[13> performance
</[13> a <{14> <[14> Broadway </[14> that that that will suit them best <{15>
<[15> <,> </[15>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#123:1:A>
There won't be any danger so so they tend to support that that
that aspect but but not the the literary thing

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X124:1:Z>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X125:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X126:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X127:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X128:1:Z>
<[5> Yeah </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X129:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X130:1:Z>
<[7> Uhm </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X131:1:Z>
<[8> Uhm </[8> </{8>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X132:1:Z>
<[9> Uhm </[9> </{9>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X133:1:Z>
<[10> Uhm </[10> </{10>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X134:1:Z>
<[11> Uhm </[11> </{11>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X135:1:Z>
<[12> Yeah </[12> </{12>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X136:1:Z>
<[13> Uhm </[13> </{13>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X137:1:Z>
<[14> Uhm </[14> </{14>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X138:1:Z>
<[15> Uhm </[15> </{15>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X139:1:Z>
Do you think that  ' s still an issue that I mean do do you think
that they they don't support because uhm you know people could speak up </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-013#140:1:A>
Well I no I that that is not that obvious now

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#141:1:A>
I mean I mean even especially in the new uhm they have published a
new cultural policy that that just come out uh come out recently and uh it it
says that uh for the government cultural policy they said that in the past
they put more emphasis on performing arts in the future may be they will also
look at the issue visual art and literature <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#142:1:A>
So so I think basically for the colonial government I mean they
right now they take a different attitude <{2> <[2> now </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#143:1:A>
So so probably that won't be the the main interest but basically
in the past they are <&> tut </&> just not concern I mean for a writer in
Hong Kong is that nobody support you you do it on your <{3> <[3> own </[3>
goodwill uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#144:1:A>
You want to do it nobody will ban your work or censor your work
you can do it but you will get no support at all

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#145:1:A>
That  ' s that  ' s the problem

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#146:1:A>
It  ' s the good thing and the bad thing <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> it  ' s
better than you are being uh raised by the government and and and and and and
the government feed you and you have to to to to obey the government

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X147:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X148:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X149:1:Z>
<[3> Yeah </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X150:1:Z>
<[4> Yeah well </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X151:1:Z>
But do you know of any country where this is the the case </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-013#152:1:A>
Like Hong Kong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X153:1:Z>
Yeah <&> A laughs </&> no where where no the opposite <&>
both-laugh </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X154:1:Z>
We We  ' re talking about utopia <&> both-laugh </&> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-013#155:1:A>
Utopia <&> both-laugh </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#156:1:A>
Yeah we  ' re talking about utopia

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X157:1:Z>
I mean the Danish government put a lot of money a lot of money
into culture but and oh well I have been supported <{1> <[1> by by </[1> the
government in small grants <{2> <[2> but uh </[2> nothing to live on

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X158:1:Z>
My God </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-013#159:1:A>
<[1> Ha ha </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#160:1:A>
<[2> Ha ha ha </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#161:1:A>
But in Hong Kong even though small <{1> <[1> grant </[1> <.> does
</.> doesn't exist ha ha

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#162:1:A>
Well in in in China for example uhm a writer will get the monthly
salary <{2> <[2> something </[2> like that so even if he doesn't write and he
will still get a salary

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#163:1:A>
But of course we don't envy that I mean <{3> <[3> <,> you don't
</[3> <&> both-laugh </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#164:1:A>
Well <{4> <[4> you may </[4> support yourself but than you belong
to the party or you belong to the <{5> <[5> writers  '  </[5> association and
it means that you have to speak from a certain perspective <{6> <[6> <,>
</[6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#165:1:A>
I I I do not wants to do that

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#166:1:A>
I think that it will better be a a freelance writer uh on your own
<{7> <[7> <,> </[7> and you can write whatever you want to

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#167:1:A>
I think that is important

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X168:1:Z>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X169:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X170:1:Z>
<[3> No how much </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X171:1:Z>
<[4> You got </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X172:1:Z>
<[5> Yeah </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X173:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X174:1:Z>
<[7> Yeah </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X175:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-013#176:1:A>
Uh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X177:1:Z>
Uhm but uhm what about I mean I  ' ve I  ' ve I have an <{1> <[1>
impression </[1> that Hong Kong is one of the places in the world that has
the highest per capita rate of publications and newspapers <{2> <[2> <,> and
</[2> uh I mean you forever seeing people seeing reading papers <{3> <[3> in
Hong Kong and </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X178:1:Z>
And the the Chinese papers do they run literary columns and they
uh do they give space to to fiction and poetry </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-013#179:1:A>
<[1> Ha ha </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#180:1:A>
<[2> Ha ha yet that </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#181:1:A>
<[3> Ha ha ha ha </[3> </{3>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-013#182:1:A>
<indig> Nah </indig> let me tell you that is the interesting
thing about Hong Kong and make that makes Hong Kong a bit of different from
uhm mainland China or Taiwan

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#183:1:A>
In in mainland China you will actually have uhm good literary
journals

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#184:1:A>
So so you  ' re if you have a novel or short story or a poems or
essays you can always submit to some of those good literary journals <{1>
<[1> and </[1> uh they are all around the country I mean so many <{2> <[2>
provinces and </[2> they have so many good literary journals

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#185:1:A>
But in Hong Kong it is always not so I mean we we don't really we
don't have a lot of uh literary magazines uh very little uh magazines uh
literary journals and so <{3> <[3> on </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#186:1:A>
So actually starting from the seventies onward when the <&> tut
</&> when the local writers I mean have grown up and be more mature to write
about Hong Kong then at that time in the seventies most of the our
contemporaries would get their work publish in newspapers other than in
literary journals <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> uh because there are so many newspapers

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#187:1:A>
And in the old in the old days one interesting thing about this
this <.> liter </.> this uh newspaper is that they have a lot of columns

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#188:1:A>
They have <.> s </.> for example on one page they will have like
uh twenty to thirty columns so so each each each writer has a certain column
that he write every day

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#189:1:A>
Uhm in in the old days uh those columns were occupied by uh older
<.> wri </.> elder writers that came from China

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#190:1:A>
So what they write about will be like reminiscence about lives in
China uh in the old days or about uh kind of uh about food or about uh uh uh
uh uh the the the the the uhm <&> tut </&> horse-race uh about entertainment
about that kind of things

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#191:1:A>
But eventually in the seventies that there was the a paper in
which the editor is actually uh one that is interested in literature so he
think of as a way uhm combining this together with some new uh columns by by
by young writers

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#192:1:A>
So for example he will set aside a certain space for uh short
stories and actually encourage uh new writers or experimental kind of uh work

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#193:1:A>
So the the experimental kind of work in <.> seven </.> in the
seventies uh does not come in a kind of underground magazine but rather in a
very popular kind of uh newspaper

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#194:1:A>
<{5> <[5> So </[5> in the newspaper on one page or in in this
column you will have uh very old-fashioned kind of entertainment uh review or
so on but on the other hand you will have experimental short stories or poems
<{6> <[6> coming </[6> together

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#195:1:A>
So it  ' s like Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#196:1:A>
You have everything all mixed in on one page <{7> <[7> <,> </[7>
so uh like like like like like uh just is I think the the situation is very
unique because you you don't really say that <&> tut </&> uh literature is
pure is noble it cannot be mixed with other things but rather because you
have grown up in Hong Kong then you accept it and co-exist with all kinds of
<{8> <[8> various </[8> kinds of things <{9> <[9> <,> and </[9>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X197:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X198:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X199:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X200:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X201:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X202:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X203:1:Z>
<[7> Uhm </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X204:1:Z>
<[8> Uhm </[8> </{8>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X205:1:Z>
<[9> Uhm Did </[9> </{9> did you get published there </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-013#206:1:A>
I <.> publi </.> I got published that way too

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#207:1:A>
I mean I I I I I yeah I I I I got my work published in the
newspapers

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#208:1:A>
A lot of our contemporary uh got publish that way <{1> <[1> <,>
</[1> so so we submit to newspaper

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#209:1:A>
They may have literary supplements at times or sometimes it  ' s
just these columns but sometimes the the editor will open up a certain
columns so that everybody will contribute to it <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and in it
there are actually some some actually some of the the most interesting uh
novel or short stories were at first published in the form of newspaper <{3>
<[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#210:1:A>
I think it is unique

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#211:1:A>
I don't see it happening in Taiwan or in mainland China <{4> <[4>
<,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#212:1:A>
It  ' s only in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#213:1:A>
So there is certain limitation but on on the other hand may be we  ' ll
make use of these limitations to do <{5> <[5> something </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#214:1:A>
Ha ha ha

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X215:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X216:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X217:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X220:1:Z>
You you did you work on a regular basis for a paper or </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-013#221:1:A>

as a translator <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> as a translator

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#222:1:A>
And then I work uh as a editor and then I eventually I work as an
art director for <.> Chi </.> South South China Morning Post <{2> <[2> <,>
</[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#223:1:A>
That was in the late seventies

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#224:1:A>
<{3> <[3> Ha ha </[3> I think that is

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#225:1:A>
I I I learn those things uh through my working experience not not
from my college

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X226:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X227:1:Z>
<[2> Oh really </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#X228:1:Z>

So I I I know basically I know almost all the local uh writers
people <{1> <[1> artists <,> </[1> and so forth <{2> <[2> <,> <[2> because of
that period when I work in <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-013#236:1:A>
So I I never really consider myself a academic person I I I I have
