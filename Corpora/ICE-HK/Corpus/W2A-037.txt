<ICE-HK:W2A-037#3:1>
On December 13 , 2001 , the last of 8,775 viaduct segments was put
in place on West Rail , marking the completion of 9.8 km of viaducts in a
record 30 months .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#4:1>
When other sections being constructed under different station
contracts are also completed , the West Rail viaducts will total 13.4 km in
length , making it the longest bridge structure in Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#5:1>
Several factors account for the length of viaducts on the 30.5 km
long West Rail Phase I , including the presence of river courses , footpaths
, roads , communities and more importantly the flood plains in the North West
New Territories . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#6:1>
&ldquo; We chose the viaduct option because that way we won't
sever local communities and we can maintain free passage between columns for
river courses , roads and footpaths , &rdquo; said Kowloon-Canton Railway
Corporation  ' s &obrack;  KCRC &cbrack; Director of West Rail , Ir Ian Thoms .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#7:1>
&ldquo; Also , West Rail crosses an alluvial plain that is susceptible
to flooding .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#8:1>
We did consider embankments for part of the way , but embankments
occupy a large footprint so they  ' re not so environmentally friendly , and
they don't allow passage of people . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#9:1>
Apart from the maximum railway gradient of 3&percent; , the height
of the viaduct was determined by such factors as water level during the wet
season and track configuration .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#10:1>
At Siu Hong Station , for example , the track is at the first level
with the concourse above it , but at Tuen Mun station it is the other way
round . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#11:1>
KCRC split the main portion of the viaducts into two contracts
consisting of a 5.5km section between Kam Tim and Tin Shui Wai and Siu Hong
respectively .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#12:1>
In the event , the Maeda-Chun Wo Joint Venture &obrack;  Viaduct &cbrack; overcame
the opposition and won both contracts , which totaled HK&dollar;2.12 billion
in value .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#13:1>
Work commenced in July 1999 . </p> <O> Diagram </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#14:1>
Since in situ construction would have been noisy , disruptive and
slow , precast segmental construction was prescribed in the design from the
outset .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#15:1>
Nevertheless , an alternative design was proposed and accepted ,
resulting in substantial savings for the West Rail project . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#16:1>
Under the conforming design , the load of the box girders would
be transferred to circular piers via a pier head roughly in the shape of an
inverted pyramid .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#17:1>
Under the alternative design developed by Robert Benaim Assoicates ,
however , each pier segment was placed directly on top of its own pier .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#18:1>
Having the webs directly under the tracks allowed the box sections to
be slimmed down while re-radiation noise was also reduced .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#19:1>
About 27&percent; of the concrete required under the conforming
design was thus saved .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#20:1>
At the same time , the monolithic connections eliminated the need for
bearings , thus saving more on bearings , thus saving more on construction
costs as well as future maintenance costs . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#21:1>
The segments were precast in Little Montana in Zhuhai , near
Macau , prior to the enclave  ' s handover in December 1999 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#22:1>
The precasting sub-contractor later moved to Dongguan to complete its
work . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#23:1>
Twenty-eight moulds were used to match-cast three main types of
segments , with 18 used for span segments , six for pier segments and four
for cantilever segments . </p> <O> Photo </O> <O> Photo </O> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#24:1>
Three ways to build a viaduct </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#25:1>
Deck erection began in May 2000 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#26:1>
According to the KCRC , the initial approach was to utilize overhead
launching girders because it would be able to cater for the three structural
systems present on the viaduct as well as the small wing cantilevers of the
segments in the conforming design .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#27:1>
However , with the adoption of the alternative design , which
featured deeper segments with wider wings , underslung launching systems
entered the picture . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#28:1>
The majority of segments were placed using Types II underslung
launching girders measuring 85m in length each .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#29:1>
The self-launching system consisted of twin plate girders , one below
each wing of the segments .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#30:1>
Segments were crane-loaded into the girders and taken to their
approximate position by trolleys with hydraulic jacks used to support the
segments and adjust their alignment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#31:1>
The segments were glued and primarily stressed once all the segments
in a span had been loaded .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#32:1>
Precast parapets were then installed before secondary post-tensioning
was applied and the dead load transferred to hydraulic jacks on the pier .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#33:1>
Once this had been achieved , the girders were lowered and slid
forward by a chain drive system for placement of the next span . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#34:1>
The initial progress rate was six days per span , from setting up
the girder to loading on the segments and buttering up the faces .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#35:1>
Once the learning curve was overcome , the progress rate improved ,
once to four days per span .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#36:1>
With each span measuring an average of 35m between piers , that would
be close to 70m of viaduct in a little over a week . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#37:1>
For the crossover areas at Kam Tin and Tin Shui Wai , the deck
erection specialist sub-contractor , VSL , developed a Type I girder
consisting of a series of removable module that allowed the length of the
inverted triangle truss to vary from 22m to 40.5m .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#38:1>
Supported on needle beams resting in blocked out holes in the piers
and brackets on top of the portals , the girder was moved forward by a
crawler crane .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#39:1>
Capable of transverse movement , this girder allowed the placement of
parallel segments in the crossover areas .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#40:1>
A third method of segment erection was also used on West Rail , for
the erection of larger spans on about 1km of the viaducts .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#41:1>
The balanced cantilever method involved the placement of segments on
either side of a pier segment followed by temporary stressing .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#42:1>
Permanent post-tensioning was applied after a few pairs of segments
were placed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#43:1>
The process was repeated until a span was competed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#44:1>
The stitch between adjoining spans were then filled with in-situ
concrete .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#45:1>
A total of 28 spans were constructed using the balanced cantilever
method . </p> <O> Photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#46:1>
Altogether eight pairs of launching girders were used on this
project . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#47:1>
Challenges and solutions </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#48:1>
The segments are shaped so that each span forms a portal , a
design which is good for modern railways . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#49:1>
&ldquo; On standard steel plates you have scarf joints to absorb
the movement as the rails slide on the face when they expand or contract ,
but with continuous welded rail , which gives a smoother ride , you don't
want any movement , &rdquo; Ir Thoms explained .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#50:1>
&ldquo; When you have discrete portals , it means movements in the
structure can be taken up y individual portals rather than a system dealing
with the movement every 300m or so .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#51:1>
That means we can have continuous floating slab track and don't need
expensive movement joints . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#52:1>
The 3.2 m high parapets serve several functions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#53:1>
They act as noise barriers and are used to carry the overhead lines
as well as brackets for cabling and a walkway for firemen  ' s access and
maintenance .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#54:1>
The width of the aluminium walkway was carefully calculated to ensure
that it would confine noise generated by the train  ' s undercarriage without
interfering with the train  ' s movement .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#55:1>
According to Ir Thoms , it was also designed with safety in mind:
should a train derail , the walkway will progressively drop away so it will
not act as a &ldquo; tin opener &rdquo; , furthering damaging the train and
endangering the lives of passengers . </p> <O> Photo </O> <O> Photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#56:1>
Although the parapets can be extended to form a higher noise
barrier , KCRC does not want to see the viaduct fully enclosed , both because
it wants passengers to enjoy natural daylight and because more stringent fire
strategy for tunnels would apply if it was fully enclosed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#57:1>
Some sections , however , will be shielded from nearly residential
towers by noise barriers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#58:1>
The segments are supported by a total of 1,119 piers founded on
748 piles of up to 2,500 mm diameter .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#59:1>
In areas in Long Ping that contain marble/pyroclastic breccia ,
ground improvement with pre-grouting before and shaft grouting after pile
casting were carried out so that bored piling using bentonite suspension can
be employed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#60:1>
Where piling works were restricted by lack of work space or vibration
limits , pre-bored H-piles were used instead of bored piles . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#61:1>
The length of the viaduct means that it would inevitably
encounter a host of facilities whose operation must be maintained throughout
the construction period .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#62:1>
Examples include a section crossing the Route 3 Country Park Section
where works could only be carried out at night under temporary traffic
arrangements and the erection of protective enclosures where work was carried
out directly above Light Rail tracks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#63:1>
Timely completion of the viaduct was critical sue to the need to
achieve a number of access dates .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#64:1>
The trackwork contractor has already completed 60 - 70&percent; of
the trackwork on the viaducts and other systemwide contractors are proceeding
apace with the track-related installation programme . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#65:1>
West Rail is scheduled for completion in December 2003 , but with
the overall programme going smoothly , an earlier completion is expected to
be achieved .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#66:1>
Ir Thoms would not reveal any exact date , but signs are that it will
fall in the third quarter of the same year . </p>

Additional truck transfer facilities to Kowloon East and water supply
to Anderson Road quarries </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#68:2>
By Ir H K Wu </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#69:2>
<bold> Description </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#70:2>
Rapid development in Kowloon East necessitated the construction
of additional trunk transfer facilities to supplement the water supply to the
area to cope with growth in water demand .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#71:2>
It was also necessary to construct dedicated fresh water and salt
water supply and distribution systems to meet the demand from the new
developments in the Anderson Road Quarries site , the first stage being at
the Po Lam Road platform .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#72:2>
It was forecast in 1995 that the population intake at the new estates
at Po Lam Road would reach 16,000 by year 2001 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#73:2>
The proposed works for the truck transfer facilities comprised
the construction of the Tsui Lam Fresh Water Pumping Station , laying of
approximately 5 km of 600-1000 mm diameter fresh water trunk mains ,
modification of the existing Shun Lee Tsuen Pumping Station and modification
of the monitoring and control facilities of various service reservoirs .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#74:2>
Extension of the water supply systems to the new developments in the
Anderson Quarries site consisted of construction of the Anderson Road No 2
Fresh Water Service Reservoir and laying of approximately 3 km of 250-600 mm
diameter fresh water and salt water distribution mains . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#75:2>
The planning , design and supervision of the construction works
of the project were carried out by the Water Supplies Department &obrack;  WSD &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#76:2>
Detailed design commenced in late 1995 and was completed in mid 1997 .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#77:2>
The construction work was divided into three main packages: the
Tsui Lam Fresh Water Pumping Station; the Anderson Road No 2 Fresh Water
Service Reservoir; and the mainlaying works . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#78:2>
Design highlights </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#79:2>
To meet the development requirements of the Anderson Road
Quarries site , a new service reservoir of 15,000 cu m capacity had to be
constructed with an invert level at approximately 200 mPD .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#80:2>
Suitable locations within reasonable proximity to the quarries site
were limited since the quarries themselves would continue to operate . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#81:2>
A hilly site near the junction of Po Lam Road and Anderson Road
was chosen to minimise the length of the local water mains to be laid to
supply the Po Lam Road site .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#82:2>
The form and the orientation of the reservoir were carefully designed
to minimise the visual impact of the completed works on sensitive receivers .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#83:2>
To reduce the amount of excavation involved , it was decided to
minimise the footprint of the reservoir and to maximise the reservoir height .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#84:2>
As a result , an L-shape was chosen for the reservoir footprint so as
to blend in with the hilly and sloping terrain .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#85:2>
A water retaining height of 9 m was adopted for the reservoir , which
approached the upper limit for the economic design of cantilever perimeter
and division walls .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#86:2>
The roof slab was a 225 mm thick flat slab system to be supported on
the reservoir walls and 550 mm N&tilde; 550 mm square columns with flared column
heads at 4,500 mm spacing . </p> <O> Photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#87:2>
Low cost and ease of construction were typical features of
cantilever wall design in comparison with counterfort wall design .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#88:2>
Although counterfort walls would have slimmer sections , the
construction cost would be higher due to the higher formwork cost .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#89:2>
Besides , due to space constraints , counterfort walls were
considered not suitable , as they would cause obstruction to the construction
of the ancillary structures around the reservoir .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#90:2>
To tackle the problem of cracking , extra provisions were
incorporated in the specifications to control the rise of in temperature
during concreting and reduce the temperature gradient along the wall section .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#91:2>
Special attention was also paid to landscaping and environmental
compliance .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#92:2>
The Landscape Unit of the highways Department was invited to carry
out the landscape design , the intention of which was to mitigate the visual
disturbance posed by the reservoir by blending the site with the visual
landscape .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#93:2>
All the slopes formed were first covered by hydroseeding .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#94:2>
Upon completion of the civil works , planting works were carried out
according to the landscape design .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#95:2>
Screen planting of native species would also be undertaken along the
exposed faces of the reservoir . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#96:2>
The Tsui Lam Fresh Water Pumping Station was designed as an
unmanned station for accommodating two different pump groups , namely the
ultra high level and the high level pump groups for supplying the new
Anderson Road No 2 Fresh Water Service Reservoir and the various secondary
reservoirs in the Kowloon East areas respectively .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#97:2>
Various design options were considered for accommodating eight
pumpsets in the best configuration within the limited space of the pump hall .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#98:2>
The pumpsets were designed to operate automatically depending on the
water levels of the receiving service reservoirs .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#99:2>
Provision of manual control of all pumpsets has been made at the
local switchboard and remote control facilities at other pumping stations via
the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System &obrack;  SCADA &cbrack; have also been
provided . </p> <O> Photo </O> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#101:2>
Anderson Road No 2 Service Reservoir </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#102:2>
The fist challenge for the construction team was to make an
access to the mid-hill where the proposed service reservoir would be situated .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#103:2>
Approximately 900 soil nails in ten rows were installed for
stabilisation of the newly formed slopes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#104:2>
Excavation of slopes and installation of soil nails had to proceed
simultaneously in order to maintain slope stability . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#105:2>
To achieve the objectives of safety and progress , the
intermediate sequences for these two activities required very careful
planning in accurate cycles .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#106:2>
To avoid conflict between various construction activities , it was
decided to construct a very steep temporary access road first , thereby
enabling multitasking and synchronisation of some construction activities .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#107:2>
Thus oil nailing and slope cutting could be expedited while
excavation at the service reservoir sit could be started simultaneously .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#108:2>
The service reservoir was constructed half way up a large
natural slope .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#109:2>
The original slope was quite steep , dictating the size of the
platform for construction of the service reservoir .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#110:2>
During the construction stage , the space at the works area was so
tight that the contractor encountered difficulties in moving the heavy mobile
cranes around the site .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#111:2>
To overcome this , the contractor employed a tower crane , which was
found to be quite suitable and effective under the space constraint . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#112:2>
The 9 m high perimeter walls of the service reservoir were of
cantilever wall design and consequently had relatively thick sections .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#113:2>
To minimise the risk of leakage , it was decided to cast each wall
section in one go without provision of intermediate construction joints .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#114:2>
Temperature control during and after concrete casting was a key
consideration for these mass concreter pours .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#115:2>
This was especially crucial for the construction of water-retaining
structures where formation of cracks had to be precisely controlled .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#116:2>
Several trials including the choice of concreting placing
temperature , curing method , use of additives , and use of cooling pipes
were investigated to explore and establish the ways to lower the maximum
temperature rise in the concrete .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#117:2>
In addition , thermocouples were placed inside the concrete cores to
record the temperature rise and the temperature gradient across adjacent mass
concrete blocks .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#118:2>
In this case , the maximum rise in temperature was found to be
acceptable when the concrete casting temperature was kept below 25&degree; C . </p>
<h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#119:2>
Tusi Lam Fresh Water Pumping Station </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#120:2>
The Tsui Lam Fresh Water Pumping Station was a three-level
structure &obrack;  ground floor , intermediate utility floor and lower basement &cbrack; to
be constructed to the north of the Tseung Kwan O Primary Service Reservoir .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#121:2>
The only access to the site was by a narrow internal access road by
the side of the service reservoir .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#122:2>
Various activities involving the use of the access road had to be
carefully planned and coordinated well in advance to avoid conflict . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#123:2>
Extremely close supervision was exercised during the
construction of the two basement floors to ensure watertightness of the
structure since the lower basement was some 9 m below ground .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#124:2>
The proposed watermain networks surrounding the pumping station ,
together with the surge tank system , the power supply cables and the control
cables , etc , created a very congested subsurface environment at the east
and south sides of the pumping station .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#125:2>
The contractor and the site supervision team paid much attention to
the programming of all these works and many liaison meetings were held in
order to minimise conflicts during construction . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#126:2>
Conclusion </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#127:2>
This is a typical water supply project to expand the existing
fresh water and slat water supply system to cater for new developments .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#128:2>
The period from inception to completion was rather short , spanning
over only five years .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#129:2>
Space constraint at the service reservoir and the pumping station
sites was one of the major difficulties encountered by the design and
construction teams .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#130:2>
With the cooperation of staff from the Design Division , the
Construction Division , the in-house Mechanical &ampersand; Electrical project team and
the operation and maintenance divisions as well as the contractors , the
project was completed in time to meet the population intake . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-037#131:2>
Construction work totaling approximately HK&dollar;200 million
commenced in late 1997 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#132:2>
Both the pumping station and the service reservoir as well as
critical sections of the water mains were completed in 2000 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-037#133:2>
The remaining mainlaying works for improving the distribution system
commenced in1999 and are due for completion in 2002 . </p>
