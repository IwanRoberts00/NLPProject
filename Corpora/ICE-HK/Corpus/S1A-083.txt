No <{1> <[1> in </[1> American I  ' m very lazy

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X210:1:Z>
In American I  ' m like a Hong Kong person

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X211:1:Z>
<{2> <[2> Hong </[2> Kong people never go anywhere but <{3> <[3>
maybe </[3> Shenzhen <{4> <[4> <,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X212:1:Z>
<{5> <[5> But </[5> in American I don't go <{6> <[6> anywhere
</[6> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-083#213:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#214:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-083#216:1:B>
<[4> Yeah </[4> </{4>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-083#217:1:A>
<[5> Uh </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#218:1:A>
<[6> But </[6> </{6> American is is <,> much larger than Hong Kong
<{1> <[1> uh </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#219:1:A>
I think if I  ' m uh American I <,> I should <,> I should be uh not

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#220:1:A>
<{2> <[2> I would </[2> I like to walk around <,> yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X221:1:Z>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X222:1:Z>
<[2> Uh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X223:1:Z>
I I go around my city it <,> it very expensive to travel

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X224:1:Z>
Because there there there are mostly are not trains

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X225:1:Z>
And you either have to drive which takes a long time or you fly

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X226:1:Z>
Yeah so it <,> it  ' s more expensive

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X227:1:Z>
In China the train are so good and the buses are good so <{> <[>
<,> </[> it  ' s </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-083#228:1:B>
<[> Uh ha </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#229:1:B>
The the bus is good but I think the <{> <[> people are not uhm bit
</[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X230:1:Z>
<[> Or the the the the <?> bit </?> </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X231:1:Z>
It it it you survive the bus is quite good <&>

<$B> and

<$Z> laugh </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X232:1:Z>
They they <{> <[> drive they drive </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-083#233:1:B>
<[> <unc> two-words </unc> </[> </{> the two thing
dangerous

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#234:1:B>
They don't follow any transportation rules

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X235:1:Z>
No but

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X236:1:Z>
There are no such things as law that has to be <?> follow </?> in
China

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X237:1:Z>
There  ' s there  ' s way there  ' s interpreting <,> any given law
regulation

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X238:1:Z>
So they <,,> from what I understand in China

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X239:1:Z>
You are much more likely to get a parking ticket than to get a
speeding ticket

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X240:1:Z>
As as long as you moving they don't really care

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X241:1:Z>
So yes it  ' s a bit dangers and it  ' s it  ' s amazing that there
will be a blind turn where you can't see lot  ' s in front of you

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X242:1:Z>
And they  ' ll go around two or three car as the uh trackers or
whatever

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X243:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X277:1:Z>
And </[4> they are they are very wonderful

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X278:1:Z>
They are very very clean and <{5> <[5> there  ' re </[5> people

<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X413:1:Z>

I want is there have a plane ticket for maybe Shanghai or or Hong Kong in my

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X414:1:Z>
And then just walk right out <&>

<$A> laughs </&> <,> get on the plane and <{> <[> then </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-083#415:1:A>
<[> <?> Uh </?> </[> </{> you bring your luggage to to uh get
<{> <[> your <.> grad </.> graduate </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X416:1:Z>
<[> Yeah and </[> </{> my father hates the city too

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X417:1:Z>
Because he  ' s from New York and then Philadelphia near by <{> <[>
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X418:1:Z>
And </[> uh <?> near he </?> don't like Philadelphia

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X419:1:Z>
So he said he would meet me in Shanghai and he will watch my
graduation on the internet

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X420:1:Z>
Because they broadcast there

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X421:1:Z>
I  ' m hear that he doesn't want to come again <&>

<$A> and

<$Z> laugh </&> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-083#422:1:A>
<[> Yeah yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-083#426:1:A>
No one will watch it actually

No need to <,> have broadcasting

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X428:1:Z>
I I I think they also do it because there  ' s only so many seat
<,> available where they have the ceremony

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X429:1:Z>
So if if if if you are so you limited the number of relative you
can <?> buy </?>

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X430:1:Z>
So <,> if if if you bring more relatives or friend they can go to
different auditorium and watch it on TV <,> yeah or on the internet

<ICE-HK:S1A-083#X431:1:Z>
But you only get a certain number of tickets to the actual
ceremony </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-083#590:2:A>
<[> Just </[> </{> may be one thing is that uhm <,> we can

Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-083#603:2:A>
The <{> <[> Chinese </[> culture think that parents and their

most young Chinese people <unc> two-words </unc> no </X>

<$A>

Yup </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-083#625:2:C>
