<[> But </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#82:1:A>
But I think it  ' s a very uh interesting trip because I can see uhm
how the Peking people live uh their lifestyle and many other things that I
cannot see in Hong Kong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X83:1:Z>
But was it was much different than Hong <{> <[> Kong </[> there
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#84:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#87:1:A>
<{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#88:1:A>
And uhm because I think that they uhm some of the Peking people

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X89:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#90:1:B>

<[> <unc> a few words </unc> but their difference is

Either very <{> <[> very </[> rich very very poor not in between
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#97:1:A>
<[> Because </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#98:1:A>
Between uhm I don't think that theirs is so much between for <{>
<[> example </[> and also uh teaching teaching in uh Peking uh is not good
because the teachers got a very low salary

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X99:1:Z>
<[> Right </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X100:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#101:1:A>

<{> <[> Renminbi </[>

<[> So </[> </{> what would that be

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#112:1:B>
Uh in Hong Kong dollars is similar

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#113:1:A>

Per year <&> Z  ' s speech overlaps with unidentified speaker  ' s
speech </&> I wonder how do they live </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#118:1:B>
And sometimes they don't get their salary because the local
government do not have the money

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#119:1:A>
But it is for the local government and for the uhm for the
countryside

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#120:1:A>
<{1> <[1> And </[1> for the city there  ' s no there  ' s little such
a situation

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#121:1:A>
But uhm uh for my teacher he taughting me Mandarin he  ' s a

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X129:1:Z>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#130:1:A>
Yeah we  ' d uh and also he always says that uh he do not have

He cannot afford <.> t </.> to he cannot afford to buy them yeah

Just like we  ' ll have it from Hong Kong University </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#219:1:B>
Well and the government participates in the discrimination

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X220:1:Z>
What in what way </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#221:1:B>
Uhm like uhm the five grades the government grades Executive
officers Administrative officer uhm if if you come from the college or the
polytechnics uhm you may not have the chance of being interviewed

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#222:1:B>
And even if you if you have the chance to be interviewed they
still think that you are not as good as the university students

<$A> Yeah that  ' s true that  ' s true

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X223:1:Z>

<[> Yeah </[> </{> very big </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#228:1:A>
Uh around over one thousand

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X229:1:Z>
So it  ' s small I compared to here </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#230:1:A>
Not one thousand I  ' m not <.> su </.> quite sure about that

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X231:1:Z>
For Hong Kong University how many are there nine thousand student
</X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#232:1:B>
Yeah several thousands

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#233:1:A>
Uh I think it  ' s about three thousands

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#234:1:A>
Three thousands

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X235:1:Z>
What do they teach in

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X236:1:Z>
They teach in English </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#237:1:B>
They don't teach in English

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#238:1:B>
That  ' s the point

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#239:1:B>
You  ' re right

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#240:1:A>
Yeah uh some course some teacher uh teach in English but some
teach in Chinese

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#241:1:A>
And many teach in Chinese <.> Can </.> not Chinese Cantonese

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#242:1:A>
It  ' s <{> <[> Cantonese </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#243:1:A>
For example and I  ' m studying many subjects and course but many of

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#249:1:B>
<[> Right </[> </{> <{> <[> <,> uh </[> sometimes they can

she and me

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#252:1:A>
Unless she can she can be speak <{2> <[2> fluent English </[2> but
my English is full of mistakes

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#261:1:A>
Because uh very simple English

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#262:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X263:1:Z>
But English can be simple and can be very difficult but here
would be good yeah here is good this university because you because you can

Well how how many years have you come to Hong Kong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X279:1:Z>
Three years </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#280:1:A>
Three

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X281:1:Z>
Three and a half years but every summer I  ' ve been here for every
summer I wanted to stay here and study Cantonese during the summer and every
summer I I  ' m always had to go back to United States </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#282:1:B>
To study English

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X283:1:Z>
To visit my children so I never have the chance this summer I  ' m
I  ' m going to go back as well </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#284:1:A>
But but I think Cantonese is is a very complicated language
and <{> <[> it  ' s difficult to learn </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X285:1:Z>
<[> It is difficult </[> it is difficult cos Eva <{1> <[1> tries

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#286:1:A>
<[1> As help </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#287:1:A>
<[2> The most <.> im </.> </[2> </{2> the important of that
Cantonese is useless

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#288:1:A>
It  ' s useless

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#289:1:A>
It  ' s a not a international language <{> <[> <,> </[> uhm so uhm
if you although we can although we can speak fluent uh Cantonese it  ' s not
helpful

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#290:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X291:1:Z>
So instead that you learn Mandarin </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#292:1:B>
Yeah you still have to speak in Putonghua when you are in
Peking <{> <[> <,> </[> who  ' s going to understand if you speak in Cantonese

<$Z > <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X293:1:Z>

time <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> when we first arrived in Hong Kong we were only
supposed to be here for two <{2> <[2> years </[2> so I though that for two
years it was too short of time to try to learn a language <{3> <[3> after
</[3> the two years then we found <{4> <[4> out we are going to be </[4> here
another two years

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X295:1:Z>
And now is another two years so all total we all have been here
six years </X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#376:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#377:1:A>

Chinese </[1> one thousand Chinese to come <{2> <[2> to Hong Kong </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#378:1:A>
I  ' m against this

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#379:1:A>
They are professional

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#380:1:A>
They come to Hong Kong because uh it  ' s said that it  ' s said that

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#383:1:B>
Yeah uh I don't think so

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#384:1:A>
There are not enough professional in Hong Kong so we need
them

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#385:1:A>
But I don't think so

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#386:1:B>
And they say the fresh graduates uhm the local fresh
graduates don't have the experience and that  ' s why we need we need to import
someone from China

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X387:1:Z>
So then in what fields are you talking about </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#388:1:B>

So <{> <[> it  ' s </[> a problem </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#452:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> I think Hong Kong creates the problem and

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X453:1:Z>
<[> But Hong Kong is accepting it </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X454:1:Z>
Right <{1> <[1> because they might have the problem </[1> as if
right <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> so it is a problem for Hong Kong </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#455:1:B>
<[1> Because Hong Kong invites them </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#456:1:B>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#457:1:B>

</[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#462:1:B>
Three companies which are going to manage the the policy

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X463:1:Z>
<[> That doesn't make any sense </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X464:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#465:1:B>
The companies are making lot of money

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#466:1:A>
Yeah I  ' m very disappointed

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X467:1:Z>
No these are <{> <[> companies </[> out of Hong these are Chinese
companies </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#468:1:B>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#469:1:B>
Yeah Chinese companies in China <{> <[> are </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X470:1:Z>
<[> They </[> </{> are going to <{> <[> do </[> it </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#471:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#472:1:B>
They are going to carrying out <{> <[> the </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X473:1:Z>
<[> And </[> </{> who  ' s going to handle it here on this end </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#474:1:B>
I don't know

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X475:1:Z>
So they  ' ll just place these people right from China they  ' ll
place them into the jobs </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#476:1:B>
Uhm the local employers if they think there  ' s <{> <[> there  ' re
</[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X477:1:Z>
<[> Vacancies </[> </{> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#478:1:B>
Yeah they  ' ll just tell the there companies who are in charge
of the policy and to offer them some people

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#479:1:B>
But you see see a three companies are definitely are making a lot
of money

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#480:1:B>
You have to <.> bri </.> bride the officials in order to get get a
vacancy

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#481:1:B>
You know a chance to come to Hong Kong <{1  <[1> after </[1> seven
years you become Hong Kong citizen

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#482:1:B>
And you get married <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and then you  ' ll have a
lot of children all become Hong Kong citizens

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X483:1:Z>
<[1 Uhm uhm  </[1  </{1  
 
 

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X484:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X485:1:Z>
Right so the people multiply the <{> <[> population keep on
multiplying </[> </X> <A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#486:1:Z>
<[> Good point multiplying effect </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#487:1:Z>
<{> <[> It  ' s multiplying effect </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-062#488:1:B>
<[> Yes yes </[> </{> <.> abso </.> definitely <{1> <[> so
</[1> they have to pay

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#489:1:B>
Paying it to the people in the company <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> to get
the chance to come to Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#490:1:B>
So three companies making money <{1> <[1> <,> where more </[1>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X491:1:Z>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X492:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2> </X>

<$A> <[1> Yeah I  ' m quite </[1> </{1> I  ' m quite disappointed with her Emily
Lau

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#493:1:A>
Because uh we select her I mean she is selected by the public <{2>
<[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#494:1:A>
I think that she should speak for us not for the Chinese
Government

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X495:1:Z>
<[1> You  ' re right </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-062#X496:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2> </X> </I>
