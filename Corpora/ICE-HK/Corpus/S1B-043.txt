Good evening and welcome to Newsline <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X2:1:Z>
It was just over a week ago that the Governor Chris Patten
announced that Anson Chan is to succeed Sir David Ford to become the first
local Chief Secretary <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X3:1:Z>
Mrs Chan will take over the top job next month <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X4:1:Z>
Well joining us in the studio this week is the Chief Secretary
designate Anson Chan <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X5:1:Z>
Welcome to the program </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-043#6:1:A>
Thank you

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X7:1:Z>
Reacting to the news Chinese officials have said privately that in
fact it  ' s been the Governor  ' s personal likes and dislikes and political
inclination <,> which has dictated and perhaps influenced the decisions
behind the latest government reshuffle <,> which has seen you promoted to
Chief Secretary <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X8:1:Z>
Is it because you support the Governor and his policies that has
seen uh your promotion </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-043#9:1:A>
When the Governor I recollect was interviewed uh earlier this
year <,> about the sort of qualities that he would be looking for in the next
Chief Secretary <,> I think he said that he would be looking for honesty <,>
integrity <,> ability <,> and a full commitment to the community of Hong Kong
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#10:1:A>
Since then of course he has announced his choice for a successor to
Sir David Ford <,> and I believed that in general the community  ' s response
has been reasonably warm <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#11:1:A>
Uhm so I rest on that <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#12:1:A>
Uhm my qualities and my service uh are well known <,> and I think
that I can reaffirm my commitment to the people of Hong Kong <,> and to serve
to the best of my ability

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X13:1:Z>
There were actually no other contenders for the job <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X14:1:Z>
Would you say that

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X15:1:Z>
<{> <[> There wasn't </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-043#16:1:A>
<[> I wouldn't say that </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#17:1:A>
I think that uh <,> uh there are other officers with perhaps not as
long a service as I have <,> but with very considerable experience and
excellent qualities <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#18:1:A>
So as the Governor made clear he had a number of choices and he
made his choice <,> <{> <[> based on </[> his assessment of who  ' s best
suited for the job <{> <[> <,> </[> not his personal likes or dislikes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X19:1:Z>
<[> Uhm one of those </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X20:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X21:1:Z>
One of those contenders though was John Chan <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X22:1:Z>
And John Chan has now resigned from the civil service because it
was reputed that he disagreed with the Governor and it was made clear to him
that he wasn't ever going to become Chief Secretary <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X23:1:Z>
So I  ' ll ask you again do you support the Governor and the
policies which he is now putting forward </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-043#24:1:A>
I have enjoyed working with John Chan for a great number of
years

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#25:1:A>
He is a fine officer <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#26:1:A>
But as he has himself made clear he left the service for personal
reasons not because he disagreed with the policies of the Governor <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#27:1:A>
I support the Governor  ' s commitment to the people of Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#28:1:A>
I have reaffirmed my own commitment to the people of Hong Kong and
I will serve in that spirit <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#29:1:A>


<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-043#30:1:B>
Mrs Chan I have been reading Xu Jia Tuen  ' s memoirs <,> and
one of the things he mentioned in his memoirs <,> uhm is the fact that the
through train doesn't just apply to Legislative Councilors <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#31:1:B>
The concept also applies to civil servants <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#32:1:B>
Now uh <,> is it possible that come nineteen ninety-seven <,> China
will come in as the sovereign power and China would say well uhm your
appointment as Chief Secretary <,> uh was not brought up for discussion <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#33:1:B>
China  ' s view on this matter was not sought <,> therefore we do not
feel <,> that we should be honor bound to keep Mrs Chan as Chief Secretary

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#34:1:B>
Do you see that eventuality happening not just to you personally
but to a whole host of civil servants in important positions like the
Secretary for the Civil Service <,> the Secretary for Economics Services <,>
Financial Secretary and so on

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-043#35:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#36:1:A>
I think that we must take as our first reference the provisions in
the Basic Law <,> which says that principal official posts will have to be
filled by Chinese nationals with no right of abode in any foreign country uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#37:1:A>
That provided we meet this criteria that officers continue to serve
in the interest of the future SAR Government and the people of Hong Kong <,>
that they may continue to serve after nineteen ninety-seven <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#38:1:A>
That said <,> uh I accept that of course none of us can be
absolutely certain <,> about what future we may have <,> in the SAR
Government after nineteen ninety-seven <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#39:1:A>
I think that I know what I want from life <,> and my personal
career whether I continue after nineteen ninety-seven is not by any means the
most important <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#40:1:A>
I have had a very good beginning to my service uh with the Hong
Kong Government

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#41:1:A>
I was fortunate enough to enter the administrative service which
has traditionally provided the backbone of administrators and which continues
to provide an excellent service to the community of Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#42:1:A>
I would hope <,> in the same way that I have had a good beginning
to have a good end and that is <,> that when the time comes for me to go
whenever that might be <,> I will do so graciously and with a clear <{> <[>
conscience </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-043#43:1:B>
<[> But </[> </{> the point is would you not think that this
is something which worries civil servants at this particular juncture

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-043#44:1:A>
I fully accept it does worry

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#45:1:A>
As I have said already we must take as our first reference point
the provisions in the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law <,> and the Chinese
I think on many occasions have reaffirmed <,> that they intend to faithfully
implement the Joint Declaration <{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#46:1:A>
Uh <{> <[> <?> whilst </?> </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-043#47:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#48:1:B>
<[> If in </[> </{> the event that they do not <,> come nineteen
ninety-seven first of July <,> if <,> at that point they say some of you will
have to come off the train <,> what do you think the civil servants  ' 
reaction would be

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-043#49:1:A>
I think there is no disagreement uh uh that we must have
continuity in the civil service <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#50:1:A>
Uh whilst the British and the Hong Kong Government remain
responsible for the administration of Hong Kong up to thirtieth of June
nineteen ninety-seven <,> uhm <,> the choice <,> obviously in the final
analysis rests with the Hong Kong Government <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#51:1:A>
That said because of the need for continuity I think that in
reality <,> it makes a a great deal of sense for the Hong Kong Government to
start a dialogue with the Chinese in terms of the acceptability of senior
officials continuing after nineteen <{> <[> ninety-seven </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-043#52:1:B>
<[> When do </[> </{> you <{> <[> think that will take </[>
place

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X53:1:Z>
<[> Will you be doing that </[> </{> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-043#54:1:A>
Uhm we have not yet decided on the final date

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#55:1:A>
I think it would have to be probably in the next two to three years

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X56:1:Z>
Mrs Chan you  ' re going to be fifty-seven in nineteen ninety-seven

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X57:1:Z>
That  ' s normally the retirement age for civil servants <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X58:1:Z>
So <,> although you  ' ve pledged to stay on and serve beyond that
date is it realistic really that you are going to be staying on as Chief
Secretary beyond nineteen ninety-seven </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-043#59:1:A>
Well actually uh fifty-seven is not the normal retirement age
for <?> a </?> civil servant

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#60:1:A>
Fifty-seven has been chosen as the guideline for expatriate
officers to retire in order to make way for suitable local officers so that
we are in a position to implement the provisions in the Joint Declaration <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#61:1:A>
As I have already said in an earlier response uh I cannot be
absolutely certain about my own future after nineteen ninety-seven <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#62:1:A>
I will serve for as long as I am needed and as long as I am in have
the capacity to do so

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X63:1:Z>
Now you  ' ve said in a recent newspaper article that in fact the
the fact that you have actually been promoted to Chief Secretary means that
the Governor  ' s policy of localization is alive and well

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X64:1:Z>
But in the same article you also wrote that the Chief Secretary at
the moment had served for six and a half years in the job the longest serving
Chief Secretary

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X65:1:Z>
Do you think perhaps he stayed for too long and the localization
of your job should have started earlier </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-043#66:1:A>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#67:1:A>
I think the entire community and the Legislature will recognize <,>
that Sir David has served with great distinction as the Chief Secretary <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#68:1:A>
Uhm uh it is not for me to say whether he should have been replaced
earlier or later <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#69:1:A>
Uhm <,> I think that the the timing now is probably as good as any
<{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#70:1:A>
And we remain uh fully confident that we will have in place
suitable local officers in accordance with the Joint Declaration in good time
<,> before nineteen ninety-seven

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X71:1:Z>
<[> So </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X72:1:Z>
But you say that at the moment the average age of Policy
Secretaries has reduced from I think was it fifty-three to forty-six <{> <[>
<,> <[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X73:1:Z>
That well does that mean that in fact abilities and standards are
dropping because some of these local officers are having to be promoted
quickly because of the need to localize </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-043#74:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#75:1:A>
Uh we will obviously not promote uh any officer local or otherwise
to any specific post unless we are clearly satisfied that he or she can meet
the requirements of the job <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#76:1:A>
Uhm we are giving every opportunity for suitable local officers to
have the necessary exposure uh and experience and as I say we remain fully
confident that we will be able to implement the provisions in the Joint
Declaration

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X77:1:Z>
<.> Th </.> there are still eight though expatriate officers who
are holding the jobs of Policy Secretaries

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X78:1:Z>
How soon do you think the rest of the top level the top strata of
government now is going to be localized </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-043#79:1:A>
I think there  ' s probably eight or nine <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#80:1:A>
Uh we would as I say hope to uhm have all these posts filled by
suitably qualified local officers in good time before nineteen ninety-seven

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-043#81:1:B>
Civil servants are going to be very important in the
transition period

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#82:1:B>
Obviously the Governor cannot govern without the support of a civil
service and uh it would be <,> your job the job of the Chief Secretary <,> to
make sure that he does have the support

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#83:1:B>
Now however in these last few years uh I  ' m sure you will agree <,>
that the politics of Hong Kong has taken on a totally different hue from
previous years <,> and that more and more civil servants are being called
upon <,> uhm to share power with Legislative Councilors <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#84:1:B>
Uhm from what I have seen this seems to be a difficult <,> thing to
do because they perhaps have got used to the old style of administration and
today of course you now have civil servants who are finding it difficult to
make the transition

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#85:1:B>
Uh perhaps for that reason some of them are looking for jobs
elsewhere

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#86:1:B>
Now do you do you think the the for instance the administrative
officers <,> will be able to cope <,> uh with the new demands that are being
<,,> placed on them and and the new ethos of the times

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-043#87:1:A>
I agree that we live uh in a highly politicized uh atmosphere

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#88:1:A>
Uh and for many of us particularly for those of us who joined in
the uh fifties and sixties uh there are some very radical changes <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#89:1:A>
Uhm and because of that uncertainty and the need to change I felt
it necessary very shortly after I took on the job of the Secretary for the
Civil Service to get to see each and every Policy Secretary and each and
every Head of Department <,> in order to uhm uh have their views on how they
see the service uh developing what are some of their worries <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#90:1:A>
And one of the things that struck me was that notwithstanding the
fact that we are having to deal with a very new style uh Legislative Council
uhm with many issues uh politicized <,> uh most of them thought that uh
morale remained very high <,> that they had adapted uh if not well at least
willingly to changes <,> that they see the need to continue to adapt and I
was very very uh gratified to learn that each and every civil servant remains
fully committed to adapting to these changes in order to respond to the <{>
<[> community  ' s needs </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-043#91:1:B>
<[> I I </[> </{> somehow get the reverse impression of that

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#92:1:B>
I get the impression that a lot of senior civil servants uhm do not
regard some of the Legislative Councillors as their intellectual equals <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#93:1:B>
And they find it very very difficult to have to account for their
actions in front of a bunch of people who they do not respect

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X94:1:Z>
I think your answer will have to be brief Mrs Chan </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-043#95:1:A>
In the same way as I think uh civil servants have to
demonstrate their uh abilities uh and their commitment I think Legislative
Councillors probably will fully appreciate uh and acknowledge that they too
have to demonstrate their leadership qualities and their commitment <,> not
just participate in politicizing issues

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X96:1:Z>
Well that brings an end to this first half of the program but join
us in just a few minutes when we  ' ll be continuing our discussion with the
Chief Secretary designate Anson Chan </X> <O> commercial break </O>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X97:1:Z>
Welcome back to the second part of Newsline <,> and joining us on
the program this week is the Chief Secretary designate Anson Chan <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X98:1:Z>
We  ' ve been talking to Mrs Chan about the policy of localization
and the reasons for her own promotion into the job of Chief Secretary

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X99:1:Z>
We move now on perhaps Mrs Chan to discuss a little bit more about
some of the issues which you  ' re going to be facing once you <{> <[> take
</[> over the job

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X100:1:Z>
And I think probably top of the list is uhm Hong Kong  ' s
relations with China

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X101:1:Z>
We  ' ve seen this weekend the failure of the two Foreign
Secretaries to reach any agreement on the political reforms for Hong Kong  ' s
future <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X102:1:Z>
Is it now inevitable that Mr Patten is going to introduce his
reforms into the Legislative Council </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-043#103:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#104:1:A>
We are obviously very disappointed with the outcome <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#105:1:A>
The fact that the two sides have uh failed to narrow the gap uh
between us on the constitutional issues

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#106:1:A>
Uh but uh both sides have <,> uh expressed willingness to continue
the dialogue because both sides feel that it is in uh their interests to
reach an agreement

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#107:1:A>
We remain fully convinced that an that an agreement is necessary
for Hong Kong and we will do our best to try and achieve that agreement <,>
but as the Foreign Secretary has already pointed out we do have practical uh
physical constraints in that there are elections coming up in nineteen
ninety-four and nineteen ninety-five and we must make sure that legislation
is enacted in time for those elections to be conducted

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#108:1:A>
So we do not have unlimited time but we have not set a deadline
<,> and we remain uhm committed to trying and to reach agreement that will
ensure that Hong Kong has fair or open uh election arrangements that are
acceptable to the people of Hong Kong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X109:1:Z>
And if no agreement is reached how do you think relations are
going to develop with China

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X110:1:Z>
I mean I think in anybody  ' s view they are going to worsen

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X111:1:Z>
As the future Chief Secretary how do you think you would like to
try to go about mending ties with China once <unc> one-word </unc> of
the relations would have reached into such a gap

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X112:1:Z>
There will be such a gap in the <{> <[> issue </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-043#113:1:A>
<{> <[> I  ' m </[> not at this stage anticipating failure

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#114:1:A>
As I say both sides have said that they would like to reach an
agreement because it is clearly in both sides  '  interests <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#115:1:A>
Uhm if agreement is not reached then the Foreign Secretary has
made clear that the Governor would have to put certain proposals before the
Legislature and members of the Legislature will then have to vote on them <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#116:1:A>
I do not think that <,> if in the event that that happens that
necessarily indicates that the whole of Hong Kong will collapse <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#117:1:A>
Let us not forget that we have considerable cooperation with uhm
China on a wide range of issues practical issues that affect the everyday
life of Hong Kong uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#118:1:A>
Uhm and those uhm issues the cooperation on those issues uhm <,>
<.> hav </.> have continued are intensifying and I do not see necessarily
that we should conclude that they will suddenly come to an end

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#119:1:A>
The Chinese have after all many occasions reaffirmed their view
that they will not do anything to do as it were uh harm the economy of Hong
Kong because <,> <{> <[> Hong </[> Kong  ' s economic prosperity will also
benefit <{> <[> China </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X120:1:Z>
<[> But can you </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-043#X121:1:Z>
<[> But but </[> </{> can you take that at face value though
because there are the government has tried now to play down the threat of the
SAR Preparatory Committee which is being set up by China </I>
