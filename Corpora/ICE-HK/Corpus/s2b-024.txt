<X> This week  ' s letter to Hong Kong and it comes from
Frederick Fung chairman of the Association for Democracy and People  ' s
Livelihood

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#X2:1:Z>
This letter comes from Beijing </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-024#3:1:A>
Last Sunday I joined the candle light <?> vigil </?> to mourn
the late Mr David Chan Yuk <?> Chon </?> who died protesting against
Japanese claim of the Diu Yu Islands

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#4:1:A>
I could still remember how I came to know him in person almost
twenty-five years ago

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#5:1:A>
I was a Form six student and planned to organize a function in our
secondary school including Chinese culture to our fellow schoolmates and we
visited student unions of universities to <?> seek </?> more advice and
suggestions

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#6:1:A>
The late Mr Chan chairman of the student union of Hong Kong
University then received us and give us a lot of informations and referred us
to a number of contact person for further assistance

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#7:1:A>
He give me an impression that he has a strong <?> passion </?>
towards the motherland and was a very resourceful person too

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#8:1:A>
Afterwards I did not have much chance to know him too well
personally other than from the radio and television program he hosted

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#9:1:A>
Most of the forty thousand attendants of the rally that night did
not know the late Mr Chan in person

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#10:1:A>
We came to show our respect for him and offer our condolence to his
family

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#11:1:A>
We came to tell the Japanese government we are saddened by
the mishap but we are not scared

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#12:1:A>
We also came to show the Chinese government that they have broken
peoples  '  hearts by the <?> office </?> complacent over the dispute of the
Island  ' s sovereignty

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#13:1:A>
I  ' m always choked with emotion when I read the contemporary
history of China

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#14:1:A>
Being so weak <?> and problems </?> <unc> one-word </unc> China has no bargaining power at all in the political arena

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#15:1:A>
The government then was too impotent to protect our people from the
endless foreign abuse

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#16:1:A>
We have almost become convinced of that those were the days

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#17:1:A>
We have almost believed that China has regained its political
muscle and we do not need to tolerate any <?> snub </?> by
foreign superpower

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#18:1:A>
However we are particularly upset because the <unc> one-word
</unc> Diu Yu Island has waken us up from our <.> s </.> sweet dreams

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#19:1:A>
The only condolence we can get from the issue is the wave of
patriotism among Chinese people all over the world

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#20:1:A>
We are proud to say we are brave enough to defend our territory
even at the cost of our lives

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#21:1:A>
However it is just not right to allow common people to shed one
drop of blood to demonstrate Diu Yu Island belong to us

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#22:1:A>
Mr Chan died in his patriotic mission

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#23:1:A>
It has cost a man his life to be a hero because his country has not
responded sufficiently towards the Japanese military intrusion into Chinese
water

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#24:1:A>
The Japanese army <?> wished to broke up </?> so many Chinese
families before now <unc> word </unc> us one more family more

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#25:1:A>
I could not hold my tears when <unc> one-word </unc> Chan  ' s
younger son that he  ' ll remember how his father brought them to movies went
cycling and now he miss him

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#26:1:A>
I  ' m sure that tragedy will help him to grow into a brave young man

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#27:1:A>
However I feel so sorry for him that a boy of ten has <?> every </?> right to be happy playing with his father

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#28:1:A>
He is too young to shoulder the burden and the need to be a brave
Chinese <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#29:1:A>
Another group of people are going towards the Diu Yu Islands

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#30:1:A>
We are proud to see their patriotic action continued

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#31:1:A>
However any responsible government should not let its people <?>
sacrifice although </?> they are ready to do so

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#32:1:A>
A young student told me that he did not understand why people
become so impatient over the conflict

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#33:1:A>
To his young mind it starts just a few weeks ago and how on earth
could this be solved so soon

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#34:1:A>
To me the Diu Yu Island conflict is not a new one but has
surfaced since seventies

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#35:1:A>
We have been patient enough to wait for twenty five years but our
patience has run thin as we cannot see an end to the <?> old </?> subject
soon enough

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#36:1:A>
We should continue to maintain an united front to petition to the
Japanese government that they have to withdraw from our territory and to
apologize to the Chinese family for the greatest loss they have suffered
because of the Japanese <?> hostility </?>

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#37:1:A>
We also urge the Chinese government to speed up their escalating
response so the Japanese counterpart can see we have the will power to
protect our sovereignty

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#38:1:A>
Our proposal <,> to the Chinese government include the short term
and the middle term measure

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#39:1:A>
For the short term measure first to recall the Japanese ambassador
as a kind of protest

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#40:1:A>
Secondly to negotiate with the Japanese government to demand firmly
that the Japanese should withdraw from the Diu Yu Island

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#41:1:A>
And thirdly the Chinese government should deplore the Japanese
occupation of Diu Yu Island during the United Nation General Meeting and the
Security Council

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#42:1:A>
In addition the Chinese government should demand that the Japanese
should demolish the lighthouse on the Island and withdraw all warships and
aircrafts from the surrounding water of the Diu Yu Island

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#43:1:A>
If not the United Nations should apply sanction

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#44:1:A>
And fourthly according to the International Court Treaty the
Chinese government could appeal to the International Marine Court to settle
the territorial dispute over the Diu Yu Island with the Japanese

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#45:1:A>
And fifthly the Chinese government should not support any Japanese
attempt to become a standing member of the United Nations Security Council
before the settling of the Diu Yu territorial dispute and <?> move </?>
against any such Japanese attempt in the United Nations Security Council and
as well as persuading other countries to do likewise

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#46:1:A>
For the mid term measure firstly in light of not affecting the
development of the Chinese economy the Chinese government should consider
economic sanction against Japan in different phases

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#47:1:A>
<mention> A </mention> the Chinese government can impose stricter
import quality control on Japanese goods like safety hygiene and quality etc

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#48:1:A>
We consider that this will not lead to a trade war since China is
the second largest market of Japanese product and Japan is the fourth largest
market of China

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#49:1:A>
If there  ' s a trade war Japan will suffer more than China

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#50:1:A>
<mention> B </mention> China have become one of the largest market
in the world in light of economic reform

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#51:1:A>
We suggest that we use the Chinese market to apply sanction against
Japanese economic and territorial expansion

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#52:1:A>
One other way is not to allow Japanese firm to undertake the
building projects of China

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#53:1:A>
Secondly the Chinese government should deploy warship to protect
the fishermen reporters demonstrators in the territorial water of the Diu Yu
Island

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#54:1:A>
And thirdly the Chinese government should deploy Chinese warships
and troops to the Diu Yu Island so as to protect Chinese territory just like the situation in Nan Sha Quin Dao

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#55:1:A>
And lastly the Chinese government should not give Japanese
government any chance to increase military power and international influence

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#X56:2:Z>
This week  ' s Letter to Hong Kong with Frederick Fung chairman of
the Association for Democracy and Peoples  '  Livelihoods </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-024#57:2:A>
Last Thursday while I was driving to a meeting I listened to
the radio radio Hong Kong of course but it was the Chinese channel <?> Y R
Terrence </?> Young and Claudia Mo <.> wer </.> were holding a phone-in
program Open Mind Open Will

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#58:2:A>
A member of the audience called and expressed how upset he was to
see Young not participating in the program any more

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#59:2:A>
The audience query whether he was the foretaste of the media
control from the Chinese government

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#60:2:A>
Young quickly explained that the move was connected with his
promotion to an administrative role

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#61:2:A>
However the audience did not share any of the Young  ' s happiness
towards the changing for <?> director </?>

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#62:2:A>
The host had a hard time trying to convince him that there <?> were
</?> no big brothers behind the <?> scene </?>

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#63:2:A>
Hey he reminds me that I need to send Young my congratulation for
his achievement after the program

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#64:2:A>
I can imagine Young must be feeling rather awkward when he realized
that the <?> recognition </?> for his good performance was seen as associated
with some evil motive <&> The speaker moistens his mouth </&>

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#65:2:A>
And the same evening while I was reading the newspaper an article
by Mr Wong Chi Keung a retired director of the news team in the RTHK make me
aware of the pain and panic of news professional have over the request for
airtime from their Preparatory Committee

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#66:2:A>
Some critics may <?> characterize </?> the above two
reactions as being oversensitive

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#67:2:A>
However even if they are oversensitive <,> we have to look into why it
is being so

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#68:2:A>
We have to realize the existence of such anxiety amongst members of
the <?> public </?> professionals and laymen alike <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#69:2:A>
Some Chinese officials have tried to defend themselves over the
issue by saying that he did not care what the editorial policy is

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#70:2:A>
He only knew that RTHK is a government department paid by the
taxpayer <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#71:2:A>
The justification actually make the <?> a situation </?> worse

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#72:2:A>
This is what Hong Kong people <,> dread most

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#73:2:A>
The way that the Chinese look at the public media is a world apart
from that of the Hong Kong people

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#74:2:A>
In an authoritarian society the government channel is part of the
government playing the role of being its mouth piece

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#75:2:A>
The mission is to project a one-sidedly positive image of the
government

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#76:2:A>
What we have luckily enjoyed for many years now is totally
different model

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#77:2:A>
The channel is financed by taxpayers  '  money and it is to serve the
public interest playing the role of a watchdog on what the public affairs
including government policies are faring

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#78:2:A>
It has opened a considerable amount of airtime for the public to
express their own ideas <,> be they pros or cons

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#79:2:A>
Their editorial policy is to ensure impartiality and scrupulous fairness

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#80:2:A>
How can people have faith that the Chinese government would let
freedom of speech be maintained if they are so ignorant of the differences
in the function of tax-funded networks

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#81:2:A>
How can we protect something that you don't even know it exists <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#82:2:A>
Let  ' s leave the subject of allocation of airtime for the PEC for a
while

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#83:2:A>
News professionals and the general public have been time and again
being frustrated by the coverage of the news on PEC

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#84:2:A>
Reporters are always complaining about their difficulties in <?>
dredging </?> up information on PEC

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#85:2:A>
If you ask people in the street they will surely welcome to hear
more from the officials and related party directly

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#86:2:A>
If the PEC keeps shying away from the <?> public </?> how can any
meaningful two way communication be generated

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#87:2:A>
If they talk more more response from the public will be generated
and it will help to achieve better mutual understanding

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#88:2:A>
More practically we want to know more about all the decision of the
PEC as they are major issues of the transition affecting every <unc> one
word </unc> of the Hong Kong people

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#89:2:A>
While we bear this in mind we may have a different attitude towards
the issue of requesting for airtime

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#90:2:A>
How can we ask somebody to tell us more and then at the same time
denying him any channel to do so <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#91:2:A>
I believe to ease off the anxiety on both sides we need to spell
out clearly what can and what cannot be done in entertaining the request for
airtime

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#92:2:A>
First their editorial independence must be respected

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#93:2:A>
Second let the PEC have the access to air its opinions

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#94:2:A>
These two are not mutually exclusive

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#95:2:A>
A certain amount of airtime can be allocated to the <?> Preparatory
</?> Committee which is responsible for creative to production of such
programs

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#96:2:A>
Should the PEC be stubborn enough to make propaganda campaign the
size of the audience they can fetch will be a good lesson to learn

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#97:2:A>
All the existing public affair programs have been prized for their
quality and production and research

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#98:2:A>
More importantly is to allow opposing sides have fair chance to
express and defend their positions

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#99:2:A>
This contributes to the building of a democratic culture in a
healthy society and <?> every </?> Hong Kong people will long to see it
continued

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#100:2:A>
The PEC should be more ambitious in their plan to meet the public

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#101:2:A>
Besides <?> this </?> our share of the airtime on the television officials
should be prepared to employ all the different medias in <?> turn </?>

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#102:2:A>
Be more approachable

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#103:2:A>
Be more open

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#104:2:A>
Let opposition have a chance to air their opinions and the message
of the PEC will be more readily heard

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#105:2:A>
Coverage of the news on the PEC will then be more balanced and
healthy

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#106:2:A>
To conclude I totally agree to the conclusion of the SCMP
editorial on Wednesday

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#107:2:A>
The best way of the improving the PEC  ' s image will not be seeking
to commandeer RTHK airtime for propaganda

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#108:2:A>
But by open up its meetings and making it easier for the press to
cover them </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-024#109:3:A>
I found Mr Lu  ' s remarks most regrettable

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#110:3:A>
My regrets has nothing to do with whether I could gain a seat in
the provisional legislature

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#111:3:A>
My regrets comes from the Chinese way of handling different
opinions

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#112:3:A>
Their logic is you are expected to vote yes

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#113:3:A>
And you will be rewarded for the agreeing behaviour

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#114:3:A>
If you dare to choose to be different you can say no but you will
be <.> pen </.> penalized for doing so

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#115:3:A>
Such a way of handling opinions is a typical example of the long
term discrepancy in the political culture between China and Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#116:3:A>
This cultural discrepancy will be the biggest <?> stumbling </?>
block in actualizing one country two system concept

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#117:3:A>
In fact the differences in the political culture in the
political language and political values have been a most obvious issue

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#118:3:A>
However I have a feeling that the Chinese official do not
recognize its existence <?> and substantially </?>

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#119:3:A>
They are not prepared to put themselves in the shoes of peoples in
Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#120:3:A>
Their lack of flexibility to accommodate their perspective of Hong
Kong people make us feel extremely uncomfortable <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#121:3:A>
 The adamant adoption of the Chinese perspective as the only
frame of <.> re </.> reference deepen the misunderstanding and conflict
between the two cultures

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#122:3:A>
It will undermine Hong Kong peoples  '  faith in the practicability 
and the sincerity of the promise of one country two
systems

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#123:3:A>
I am aware that such cultural differences is similar to the
communication problem between a father and his son

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#124:3:A>
The difference in life experience and contrast in values of the
two generations cannot be resolved by heated argument or emotional fights

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#125:3:A>
It would just jeopardize the relationship <,> <?> shorter </?> the mutual trust and respect and will not bring forth anything positive

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#126:3:A>
<?> Eventually </?> the stormy confrontation will end up in an
irreconcilable deadlock

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#127:3:A>
The implement of the one country two system we need the Chinese
and Hong Kong people to work closely together

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#128:3:A>
We cannot have any wishful thinking that the interaction will be a
smooth one just like the river water comes to the sea

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#129:3:A>
The difference in the density the temperature and the <?> surely
</?> bring some turbulence

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#130:3:A>
However if we allow the different currents to have sufficient time
and space to mingle together the very difference in chemistry will result in
a very much rich and more nourishing water benefiting all the living <.>
organ </.> organism around <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#131:3:A>
I think the proper attitude is to have the patient to appreciate
the differences among the ourselves and to have the optimism and sincerity to
communicate in order to achieve mutual understanding

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#132:3:A>
I understand that it will take time to let Chinese official to see
why and how did Chinese style upset Hong Kong peoples time and again

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#133:3:A>
The promise of the one country two system had the wisdom to
envisage the differences in the two cultures and so prescribe the
accommodation of our different style for the SAR

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#134:3:A>
However to implement such a <?> version </?> require all the Chinese
official <.> t </.> to share the common goal and have the tolerance to allow
the other system to be different

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#135:3:A>
To make the wishing a reality we need both parties to have a faith
in positive interaction between us <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#136:3:A>
My participation in the PEC is to initiate such a positive
interaction

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#137:3:A>
After the action of Mr Lu a lot of people ask me this question are
you going to resign from the PEC

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#138:3:A>
Just I have mentioned earlier the cultural difference between two
generation in a family cannot be resolved by heated arguments

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#139:3:A>
Nor can the relation be improved by withdrawal or avoidance

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#140:3:A>
To let the two different cultures coexist <.> harmon </.>
harmoniously it requires positive interaction and communication to achieve
understanding

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#141:3:A>
I will remain in the PEC and reflect the wills of the silent
majority of Hong Kong people

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#142:3:A>
I will stand firm in remaining independent of thinking based on
the principles of being open reasonable and lawful

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#143:3:A>
I will remain to fight for the interests of Hong Kong people

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#144:3:A>
It will surely be a long and winding road to let Chinese officials
to see our perspective and let Hong Kong affairs be dealt with in the Hong
Kong style

<ICE-HK:S2B-024#145:3:A>
I am willing to embark on this difficult journey </I>
