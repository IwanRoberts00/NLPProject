<ICE-HK:S1A-028#2:1:A>
<unc> two-words </unc> can be

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X3:1:Z>
It could be a uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X4:1:Z>
Maybe that Hong Kong is actually more traditional some how than
Shanghai where Shanghai really

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X5:1:Z>
I mean okay Hong Kong is an international city

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X6:1:Z>
But it  ' s not <,> it  ' s not as international as westerners think it
is

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X7:1:Z>
<{1> <[1> But </[1> Shanghai they really do look the outside

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X8:1:Z>
But the other mainlanders <,> found

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X9:1:Z>
Just to some extent maybe mainland is found the <?> Shanghaiese
</?> more foreign than the foreigners

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X10:1:Z>
Sometimes I heard people say that

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X11:1:Z>
<{2> <[2> Uhm </[2> people a friend of mine from uhm <unc>
two- words </unc> or Beijing

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X12:1:Z>
Those <unc> two-words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X13:1:Z>
We we were sitting in a table with <?> Shanghainese </?> around
<{3> <[3> and </[3> foreigners

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X14:1:Z>
And their group said yeah the the <?> Shanghainese </?> just seem
more foreign to <?> that </?> as a foreigners

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X15:1:Z>
Maybe maybe the <?> Shanghainese </?> is different

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X16:1:Z>
But <,> but anyway I found that <,> reason <unc> two-words
</unc> or mainlander maybe just in Hong Kong </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#17:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#18:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#19:1:A>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#20:1:A>
I think uh uh Hong Kong people <?> got </?> a long ship <,> culture
of tradition

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#21:1:A>
Uh working hard have have to work hard

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#22:1:A>
Long working hour so it just keep <?> themself clear </?> <{> <[>
<,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#23:1:A>
They will not they will not try to <,> not sociable

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#24:1:A>
Because they <,> they will not think about the others

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#25:1:A>
There  ' s maybe some too independent sometime or selfish or sometime

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#26:1:A>
People will always say Hong Kong people are selfish

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#27:1:A>
But Shanghai people maybe <,> they <?> got </?> a chance to <,>
talk to the <,> the others for the oversea

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#28:1:A>
They will treasure the chance

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X29:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X30:1:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X31:1:Z>
Oh yeah maybe but <,> uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X32:1:Z>
Uh <,> yeah maybe Hong Kong people just very keen to know about
what they  ' ve spent their time on <unc> two-words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X33:1:Z>
They can't see any immediate <,> value

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X34:1:Z>
I mean I  ' ve I  ' ve found I got a bit that way myself

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X35:1:Z>
But I <,> I  ' ve found it very hard to make time <,> with people in

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X36:1:Z>
Uh uh <,> from <,> the mass majority of my friends

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X37:1:Z>
I don't <,> but I  ' ve got to <unc> two-words </unc> I got

I just can't see them for months

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X39:1:Z>

Right <{> <[> you  ' re </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#49:1:C>
<[> I don't </[> </{> think Hong Kong is a city <?> like </?>
uh as open as foreigners think <{1> <[1> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#50:1:C>
Uh </[1> I think it  ' s somehow link with the history

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#51:1:C>
<{2> <[2> And </[2> for Hong Kong Hong Kong is like <,> always open

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#52:1:C>
So people <.> don </.> need to catch these moments to to open to
the foreigners speak to them

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#53:1:C>
<{3> <[3> But </[3> for Shanghai they just <{4> <[4> like </[4> <,>
for ten years ten years time

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#54:1:C>
So they will catch it <,> the <{5> <[5> moment </[5>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X55:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#56:1:B>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#57:1:B>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#60:1:C>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#61:1:C>
And I think <,> uh some traditional thinking Chinese one survive
better here in Hong Kong <{1> <[1> than </[1> in Mainland <{2> <[2> yeah
</[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#62:1:C>
Because <,> yeah the the Hong Kong people stay together as a group

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#63:1:C>
But they seldom <,> uh see the outside world

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#64:1:C>
Because they get everything without fighting for it like the
mainland Chinese

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#65:1:C>
So they <.> don </.> need to open their eyes

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#66:1:C>
So they <.> don </.> open their eyes <,> and that  ' s why

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X67:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X68:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X69:1:Z>
Right

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X70:1:Z>
So you think uh <,> think Hong Kong people are getting soft now
<,> because life is easy </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#71:1:C>
No <?> life </?> life is getting harder and harder

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X72:1:Z>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#73:1:C>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#77:1:C>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#78:1:C>
Few years ago I have been to Italy and for an exchange programme

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#79:1:C>
And I I  ' ve known some <,> some youngster <,> among same age as me

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#80:1:C>

<,> <?> that </?> the Hong Kong youngster <.> don don don </.> possess

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#81:1:C>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#82:1:C>
That  ' s that  ' s pity because <,> I <.> don </.> think

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#83:1:C>
I think I think Hong Kong people is somehow lost in this city <{>
<[> with </[> everything like movies

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#84:1:C>
And just they just want to fit in everything into their <,> into
the twenty four hours

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#85:1:C>
And they try to make use <,> make most of it

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#86:1:C>
But and finally they they get lost

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#87:1:C>
So <,> it  ' s like <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#88:1:C>
They <.> don </.> treasure <,> like uhm <,> peace or

They will not do <{3> <[3> that but </[3> people go to work

<[6> <,> </[6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X231:1:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X232:1:Z>

It  ' s their own life and they go they do it and

<{> <[> Do you find </[> it strange </X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#241:1:A>
<[> I think </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#242:1:A>
Yeah strange

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#243:1:C>
Strange

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#244:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#245:1:A>
As Chinese we have to pay our family when we got the work we have
to pay our family <.> ev </.> every month

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#246:1:A>
Give them some money because I  ' ll have to

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#247:1:A>
Now you got the <?> world </?>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#248:1:A>
We have to give the money back to <unc> one-word </unc>
the parents

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#249:1:A>
Some kind of <,> this traditional feeling

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X250:1:Z>
But when you say you have to you mean

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X251:1:Z>
Okay <{1> <[1> I <.> un </.> </[1> I understand that it  ' s it  ' s
basic

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X252:1:Z>
But <{2> <[2> do you </[2> do you feel that something that <,>
you  ' re forced to do or something that that you accepted <{3> <[3> <,> as
normal </[3> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#253:1:A>
<[1> You think </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#254:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#255:1:C>
<[3> You are forced </[3> </{3> to do it

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#256:1:A>
I feel if <,> if I think I need not to give the money to them

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#257:1:A>
I  ' ll oh happy days <&>

<$A> and

<$C> laugh </&>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#258:1:B>
Will you <,> will you give it to them if you are not forced

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#259:1:B>
Do you think you are forced <,> to give it to them

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#260:1:A>
Yeah I think if I said can I <,> stop paying you money

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#261:1:A>
And they will <,> <?> went </?> crazy I think the

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#262:1:A>
What what

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#263:1:A>
<{1> <[1> What  ' s wrong </[1> with you something <{2> <[2> like
</[2> that

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X264:1:Z>
<[1> But you </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X265:1:Z>
<[2> Okay </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X266:1:Z>
It  ' s not my business

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X267:1:Z>
But today <,> do you give <,> does does it usually happen that
people give money to their parents

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X268:1:Z>
<{> <[> Because </[> their parents need it <,> or because it  ' s
just a tradition </X>

<$A> <[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#269:1:A>
Yeah I think I think for some families

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#270:1:A>
It  ' s because they need the money

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#271:1:A>
The parents need the money because no MPF before <{1> <[1> <,>
</[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#272:1:A>
Yeah so they need the money

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#273:1:A>
But for some <unc> one-word </unc> some people I think
<{2> <[2> <,> </[2> it  ' s a tradition

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#274:1:A>
Because I know someone <{3> <[3> uh </[3> some family they are
really rich

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#275:1:A>
The parents <{4> <[4> are so </[4> rich <.> ri </.> not to work
anymore

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#276:1:A>
Play <{5> <[5> golf <.> ev </.> </[5> everyday but they still get
the money from

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#277:1:A>
For example they they they move to Canada <,> now

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#278:1:A>
They are now living in Canada

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#279:1:A>
But their <,> their children will keep pay keep paying money to
the parents

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#280:1:A>
Not much <,> maybe just one thousand or two thousand

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#281:1:A>
For just <,> it means our <,> <{6> <[6> to take care of it
<unc> one-word </unc> </[6>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X282:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X283:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X284:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X285:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X286:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X287:1:Z>
<[6> So <.> sym </.> symbol </[6> </{6> symbolic </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#288:1:A>
Yeah <{> <[> <,> </[> yeah I think so

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X289:1:Z>
<[> Okay </[> </{> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#290:1:B>
Actually I  ' ve <?> internalize </?> this idea that I have to
pay money to them <?> when </?> <,> I  ' m working <{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#291:1:B>
I I don't think I  ' m <?> force </?> uh <?> maybe </?> it  ' s
because <,> the responsibility that I have been internalized

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#292:1:B>
But I <?> don </?> see any problem in <?> that </?>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X293:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#294:1:A>
But because I think <,> most important thing is we are now
still studying <,> as in as school

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#295:1:A>
When you go out to work you found out

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#296:1:A>
You have to pay everything for yourself the living <,> everything

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#297:1:A>
So at the time the credit card bill come every month you will
think

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#298:1:A>
Oh if I need not to pay my parents will be <?> perfect </?>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#299:1:A>
You will think in this way because you got the pressure

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#300:1:A>
<{> <[> And in uh </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#301:1:B>
<[> Maybe I </[> </{> will think so

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#302:1:B>
But <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> I still think it  ' s my responsibility to
give the money to <{2> <[2> them </[2>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#303:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#304:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2> it  ' s not the <.> res </.>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#305:1:B>
Uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#306:1:B>
I don't think I am forced

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#307:1:A>
I think I am forced

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#308:1:A>
I think <{1> <[1> I am </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#309:1:A>
<{2> <[2> I know </[2> the feeling because you will got the
pressure you see you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#310:1:A>
If you <,> do not do this <{3> <[3> someone will not happy </[3>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X311:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#312:1:B>
<[2> <unc> one-word </unc> </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#313:1:B>
<[3> You do feel bad </[3> </{3>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#314:1:C>
Do you feel bad

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#315:1:A>
I  ' m I  ' m happy to do that if I can make them happy

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#316:1:A>
But this doesn't mean I am so happy to do this <{1> <[1> because
</[1> it can make them happy <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#317:1:A>
<{3> <[3> Because </[3> in <?> terms </?> I will be happy

I mean if you parents are rich

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X324:1:Z>
I don't know if they are or not but uh

The pressure will not be so <,> so heavy <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#335:1:A>
Even though maybe uhm you know the <.> econ </.> economic in Hong

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#336:1:A>
The economy is not very good <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#337:1:A>

They loss their job they still have to take care of their family

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#339:1:A>
Maybe the parents maybe they got a family

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#340:1:A>
You got a family already <,> to <unc> two-words </unc> the

So the <?> youth </?> <{4> <[4> in in </[4> the west of the UK
works both ways

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X361:1:Z>
And the independence is on both sides

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X362:1:Z>
Uhm you know if she was homeless I would say she would accept my

<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#377:1:B>
<[6> Uhm uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#378:1:B>
<[7> Uhm </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#379:1:B>
<[8> Yeah </[8> </{8>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#380:1:B>
<[9> Uhm </[9> </{9>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#381:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#382:1:A>
I think <,> I know <unc> several words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#383:1:A>
I think a Hong Kong <,> Chinese or most of the Chinese it  ' s a
culture

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#384:1:A>
they think I got a children it  ' s a kind of investment <{> <[> <,>
</[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#385:1:A>
When they grow up they will give me the money or I don't need to
work

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#386:1:A>
<unc> one-word </unc> twenty years later <,> after their
graduation

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#387:1:A>
They finish studying <,> go to work I do not work

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#388:1:A>
So I <,> get the money from the children

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#389:1:A>
I think it goes in this way

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X390:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{> </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#391:1:C>
I think because <,> in <,,> in west <,> in the west

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#392:1:C>
You <,> you have the idea that uh individual as a unit <,> but in
Hong Kong the family is the unit

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#393:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#394:1:B>
<{> <[> Uhm </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#395:1:C>
<[> So </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#396:1:A>
Most of family very strong

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#397:1:C>
So it  ' s <,> it  ' s different

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#398:1:C>
Like the unit

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#399:1:C>
The the family is a whole and

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X400:1:Z>
Right

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X401:1:Z>
But it  ' s uhm <,,> is that

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X402:1:Z>
I mean the family typically <,> or uh <unc> one-word
</unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X403:1:Z>
I believe that the family typically will meet <,> <.> re </.>
relatively often

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X404:1:Z>
May maybe once a week or more than once a week <{1> <[1> <,>
</[1> two or three times a week

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X405:1:Z>
<unc> one-word not everyone does but

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X406:1:Z>
Uhm <,> I have a feeling <?> just </?> looking at in the outside
from the western point of view

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X407:1:Z>
I look at I I I just have a feeling <,> that they <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X408:1:Z>
You keep that so tight <,> because you are afraid that it will
fall apart if you don't <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> keep it so tight

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X409:1:Z>
<{3> <[3> You </[3> know if if if if you got a habit for few
weeks of not meeting twice a week

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X410:1:Z>
<.> Pe </.> people might think <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X411:1:Z>
Hey world goes on and I shall have more time for myself

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X412:1:Z>
This this is good

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X413:1:Z>
<{4> <[4> And </[4> so it  ' s a reluctance to <unc> one-word
</unc> go one little bit to <.> re </.> to relax it one little bit

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X414:1:Z>
<{5> <[5> Because </[5> the whole thing may not to be <unc>
one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X415:1:Z>
<{6> <[6> Because </[6> the whole thing may just get <unc>
one-word </unc> gone

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X416:1:Z>
I think there  ' s a fear that in <{7> <[7> in fact </[7> the whole
thing will will fall apart <,> <{8> <[8> if you </[8> relax it </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#417:1:B>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#418:1:B>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#419:1:B>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#420:1:B>
<[4> Uh </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#421:1:B>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#422:1:B>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#423:1:B>
<[7> Uhm </[7> </{7>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#424:1:A>
<[8> <?> I think </?> </[8> </{8> <?> it  ' s </?> happen
mostly in talking about boyfriend and the girlfriend

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#425:1:A>
The girl said why does I see you today everyday

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#426:1:A>
And the boyfriend said no no I enjoy going out on my own

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X427:1:Z>
Oh I won't see the other girl on my <&> All speakers laugh </&>
</X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#428:1:B>
Oh yeah yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#429:1:B>
So to get crazy of the other problems <&>

<$A> ,

<$B> and

<$Z> laugh </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#430:1:Z>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X431:1:Z>
I just have a just a feeling that that  ' s sort of <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X432:1:Z>
This  ' s a it <,> continues itself

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X433:1:Z>
Because as as the generations come up

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X434:1:Z>
Each one has what to say

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X435:1:Z>
Keep hold keep that tight hold on the next generation and not let
them go <{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X436:1:Z>
Was uh it could it could let  ' s go on

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X437:1:Z>
It won't come back together again <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X438:1:Z>
I mean you couldn't in the UK you couldn't <,> recreate that
family

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X439:1:Z>
You know the so call family values

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X440:1:Z>
It  ' s couldn't come back because you  ' ll have to justify it

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X441:1:Z>
<unc> one-word </unc> it  ' s someone insists to start with
you don't have to justify

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X442:1:Z>
You have to just you would have to justify change

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X443:1:Z>
So to change back to family value in UK to tight family unit

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X444:1:Z>
You can't say woo <,> why is it good

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X445:1:Z>
You know we do it good cause <,> you said we are here

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X446:1:Z>
You you have to tight family <unc> one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X447:1:Z>
And it  ' s <,> you have to justify it anyway </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#448:1:B>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#449:1:B>
But I think it  ' s partly because the older generation want the
sense of being taking care of

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#450:1:B>
<{1> <[1> Because </[1> I live with my grandmother in Quarry Bay
<{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#451:1:B>
She will be angry with <,> uh when <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> her <.>
chil </.> <{4> <[4> her </[4> daughters or her sons uh haven't <{5> <[5> call
</[5> call her for a long time

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#452:1:B>
Because she need the sense of <,> uhm <&> tut </&> being <,>
taking care or <&> The telephone rings </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X453:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#454:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#X459:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#460:1:B>
They would like the sense of security

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#461:1:B>
When <,> she came to receive a call from her sons or the daughters

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#462:1:B>
<{1> <[1> What </[1> will happen to me uhm if you <?> don </?>
call me

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#463:1:B>
You <?> don </?> know if I  ' m dead or if I have some accidents
<{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#464:1:B>
You just <?> don </?> know

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#465:1:B>
<{3> <[3> So </[3> you have to call me or visit me

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-028#466:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#467:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

of being <,> <?> alone </?> lonely <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#480:1:A>
Because Chinese culture they <,> uh the big family will live

If the son and their <.> si </.> daughter-in-law can meet with uh
with them they will be very happy

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#489:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-028#491:1:Z>

But do you think <,> family is a kind of support to <,> many
Hong Kong people

<$A> If they got problems it were in money I  ' m not
