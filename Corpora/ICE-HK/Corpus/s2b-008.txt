Good evening

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#5:1:B>
Thanks for joining us <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#6:1:B>
High-level British and Chinese negotiators will meet tomorrow in
Beijing to try to hammer out their differences on financing arrangements for
the new airport

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#7:1:B>
The plans have been stalled for weeks with the Chinese side refusing
to give its approval

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#8:1:B>
The talks were ordered by the prime ministers of both countries to
try to break the impasse<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#10:1:A>
The Airport Consultative Committee will meet on Monday to
discuss whether it should be consulted before each round of Sino-British
airport negotiations <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#11:1:A>
Member Leung Kwong Cheung noted today the negotiating teams are
expected to seek the views of the committee according to the memorandum of
understanding on the airport project <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#12:1:A>
He said the teams had shown a lack of respect for the committee by
not consulting it on the agenda of the forthcoming airport talks in Beijing
<,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-008#13:1:B>
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has given his
undertaking that China won't be allowed to interfere in the running of Hong
Kong before nineteen ninety-seven <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#14:1:B>
But he said Britain still intends to discuss with the Chinese on
whether there should be more directly elected Legco seats in nineteen
ninety-five <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#15:1:B>
The Foreign Secretary was answering some pointed questions on the
territory in the House of Commons

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#16:1:B>
We have these highlights <O> House-of-Commons-speeches </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-008#17:1:B>
As he mentioned in his reply the Foreign Secretary will be
dropping by the territory at the end of this month

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#18:1:B>
His visit has been scheduled for July twenty-sixth to the
twenty-eighth

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-008#19:1:A>
Reactions from local legislators on the Foreign Secretary  ' s
comments were varied <,> but most welcome the fact that he had clarified his
position on the two sticky issues of appointments to Exco and the speeding up
of democracy

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#20:1:A>
May Wong reports

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-008#21:1:C>
Well I think the British Government must be quite fed up with
all the threats and warnings being uh deliver by the Chinese Government in
the last few weeks

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#22:1:C>
And in order for the British to be able to govern effectively is it
very important that they assert their authority

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#23:1:C>
And uh and that  ' s why I am glad to see the Foreign Secretary Mr
Douglas Hurd making this statement saying that they are in control uh they
are making all the big decisions <O> May Wong continued </O>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-008#24:1:D>
I would hope that Mr Hurd would discuss this with the Chinese
<,> as soon as possible <,> because the longer he leaves it <,> uh it allows
more uhm <,> space for political manoeuvring <,> for speculation for
expectation to be built up <O> May Wong continued </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-008#25:1:B>
The Government has decided to grant a pay TV licence <,> and
the service is expected to be available as early as October next year

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#26:1:B>
By that time Star TV will also be allowed to partially broadcast in
Cantonese <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#27:1:B>
For other broadcasters now in operation the Government will be
introducing new rules <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#28:1:B>
Peri Chow has details

<$E> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-008#29:1:E>
The Government want to award one pay TV licence by January
next year<,> and whoever gets it will be expected to run the service by
October at the latest <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#30:1:E>
The operator will be given an exclusive right to run the service
for three years <,> during which time it cannot run advertisement

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#31:1:E>
As to subscription fees the Government won't set a limit in the
licence <,> but the future operator will have to pay its royalties based on
subscription income <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#32:1:E>
Neither will the Government compel the operator to lay a cable
network <,> but doing so can give it an edge over other competitors for the
licence <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#33:1:E>
The operator must also deposit fifteen million dollars with the
Government <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#34:1:E>
That amount will be forfeited if the operator fails to provide the
services <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#35:1:E>
As to Star TV from October next year it will be able to broadcast
in Cantonese on three of its five channels on news sport and music <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#36:1:E>
At the same time <,> it will automatically be allowed to charge
subscriptions <,> but during the three years exclusivity of pay TV it cannot
charge for its Cantonese programmes <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#37:1:E>
The Government has dismissed criticism that Star TV has been
favoured for running a subscription service without going through a
competition

<$F> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-008#38:1:F>
And I don't think we are just offering it to Star TV uh on a
silver platter <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#39:1:F>
I should emphasize that we are not allowing <unc> one-word
</unc> operators to collect subscription <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#40:1:F>
Only a Hong Kong base <,> and uplink from Hong Kong service is
given that right

<$E> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-008#41:1:E>
Both TVB and ATV will cease royalties cut from twelve to ten
percent

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#42:1:E>
Both stations will also be allowed to run advertisement on property
and financial services <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#43:1:E>
And they can cut their English services and run some programmes in
other languages <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#44:1:E>
Peri Chow TVB news

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-008#45:1:B>
Well the new broadcasting policy doesn't seem to have pleased
anyone in the industry

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#46:1:B>
Both established TV stations are dissatisfied with the new
framework and Wharf which has been after the Cable TV licence for years has
expressed hesitation

<$G> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-008#47:1:G>
TVB welcomes the decision to introduce more television
services to the public but it  ' s disappointed at the failure of the new
regulatory framework to create a level playing field from all operators in
the industry

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#X48:1:Z>
Not all the operators in the TV industry are subject to the same
set of rules

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#X49:1:Z>
For example rules governing the uh terrestrial broadcasters and
those governing the satellite TV and pay TV operators are entirely different

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#X50:1:Z>
So the the terrestrial broadcasters have to pay a very high
royalty </X>

<$G> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-008#51:1:G>
ATV wants the Government to further relax its stringent
regulations governing free TV services

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#52:1:G>
The company is unhappy with the small cut in royalty

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#X53:1:Z>
ATV is not making a profit

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#X54:1:Z>
Any available resources we would like to see them being channelled
to programme development so that uh shall we say we can live up to the
expectation of viewers

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#X55:1:Z>
Uhm however this is uh not to be the case

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#X56:1:Z>
Therefore I I am afraid our share holders will continue to dig in
their pockets to give part of that to the Government in a form of royalties
</X>

<$G> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-008#57:1:G>
Wharf Cable finds many fundamental questions unanswered

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#X58:1:Z>
It is unclear to us whether Government  ' s intent is to award one
licence or two licenses </X>

<$G> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-008#59:1:G>
The company will conduct a feasibility study before deciding
whether or not to bid for a cable TV licence <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#60:1:G>
Star TV is reserving its comment until further studies <,>

The China Motor Bus Company has agreed to accept from the
Government a new franchise <,> that will reduce its routes to just ninety

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#63:1:A>
The two-year franchise will become effective next September <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#64:1:A>
It will eliminate the company  ' s existing profit control scheme <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#65:1:A>
In line with the Government  ' s goal to upgrade local bus services
CNB will also be required to meet other conditions <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#66:1:A>
The Government believes there should not be any significant impact
on CNB staff <,> who might be affected by the new franchise

<ICE-HK:S2B-008#67:1:A>
That  ' s because there are some five hundred vacancies in the bus
industry outside CNB <,> and the new operator of the twenty-six routes being
taken away from CNB will also require four hundred drivers <,>
