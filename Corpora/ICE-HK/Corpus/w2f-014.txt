<bold> The Cloud </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#2:1>
&ldquo; Hey , be careful !

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#3:1>
Don't eat me . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#4:1>
The caterpillar on the leaf shouted .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#5:1>
Though her voice was soft , the kangaroo could still hear something .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#6:1>
It was a warm spring day .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#7:1>
Both the kangaroo and the caterpillar had waited all winter to taste
such fresh green leaves again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#8:1>
The only difference between them was that while one ate branch after
branch , the other ate leaf after leaf . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#9:1>
After the kangaroo heard her shout , he slowed down his chewing
and raised his ears to listen again . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#10:1>
&ldquo; I said , don't eat me, &rdquo; the caterpillar repeated .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#11:1>
This time , the kangaroo heard her clearly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#12:1>
The sound originated from the leaf that he was about to put into his
mouth .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#13:1>
Without a second thought , he opened his mouth and stepped backward .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#14:1>
&ldquo; Sorry , I didn't intend to eat you . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#15:1>
He looked at the caterpillar , feeling guilty . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#16:1>
The caterpillar was immediately relieved .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#17:1>
She was only about an inch from death . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#18:1>
&ldquo; All because of this careless kangaroo, &rdquo; she
thought , before saying aloud, &rdquo; what  ' s the use of saying sorry ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#19:1>
I won't forgive you , unless ... &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#20:1>
&ldquo; Unless what ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#21:1>
Just tell me , I will do anything for you, &rdquo; the kangaroo
pleaded with her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#22:1>
He blamed himself for his carelessness , which nearly cost a life .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#23:1>
&ldquo; I want ... &rdquo; the caterpillar didn't know what she
wanted .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#24:1>
In fact , she just wanted to play a trick on this creature , the most
naive kangaroo she had ever seen .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#25:1>
She knew exactly how fragile her life was and she understood the
rules of the forest .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#26:1>
By luck if she avoided being eaten one day , she could be eaten the
next , by another careless animal , or a big bird . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#27:1>
Anyway , as she was thinking , she looked up to the sky .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#28:1>
It was so high above her that she knew she could never touch it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#29:1>
In the past , she had dreamt of flying in the sky and sleeping on a
cloud . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#30:1>
&ldquo; Can you pick a cloud for me ? &rdquo; she asked , as she
saw that the kangaroo was so tall , she thought that he must be able to reach
the sky . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#31:1>
The kangaroo thought for a while .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#32:1>
Though he knew it was hard to do , he surely had to do it because he
had made a promise .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#33:1>
&ldquo; You wait for me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#34:1>
I will be back in a month . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#35:1>
He saw a mountain in the Far West that reached the sky .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#36:1>
He believed that from there , he could pick a cloud for the little
caterpillar .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#37:1>
So , he started his journey , running and running non-stop .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#38:1>
But soon , he got tired and decided to rest under a big <ul> kapok
tree </ul> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#39:1>
It was nearly the end of spring , but the mountain was still far
away .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#40:1>
Pieces and pieces of silk-cotton were falling from the Kapok tree ,
falling on his body and his head .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#41:1>
He picked up a piece of silk cotton and examined it . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#42:1>
&ldquo; It looks like a cloud ... &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#43:1>
Before long , he returned to the forest with his cloud . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#44:1>
&ldquo; Little caterpillar , I  ' ve got a cloud for you .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#45:1>
So please don't be angry with me , and I will be more careful next
time while I am eating the leaves . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#46:1>
He then gave the cloud to her with a smile . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#47:1>
The caterpillar felt really touched .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#48:1>
It  ' s the first time she found that her life was so precious , so
highly esteemed &dash; not many people had taken her words seriously in the
past . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#49:1>
&ldquo; Thank you , my dear kangaroo, &rdquo; she said in great
delight .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#50:1>
In fact , just these few words couldn't express how she felt . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#51:1>
She kept the cloud in her home , in the safest place where no
others could reach it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#52:1>
Before she went to sleep each night , she went to see the cloud and
she remembered the kangaroo  ' s smile . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#53:1>
Everyday she went to the same tree , and climbed to the very top
, so that she could see the kangaroo .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#54:1>
Sometimes she could see him , and he would say &lsquo; hi &rsquo; to
her &semi; which made her happy for the whole day &semi; sometimes she
couldn't see him , and would just wonder where he was and if he was safe .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#55:1>
The cloud buried in the home of this little caterpillar started
to decay .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#56:1>
And soon after , a new silk-cotton plant began to grow in its place .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#57:1>
The caterpillar didn't know why only her cloud changed shape and
color , but not those in the sky .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#58:1>
One day , when nothing that looked like a cloud remained , she
decided to ask kangaroo to get another cloud for her . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#59:1>
&ldquo; Sorry kangaroo , I ... I may have lost the cloud you gave
me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#60:1>
Can you give me another ? &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#61:1>
This was mid-summer .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#62:1>
No more silk cotton would fall from the tree , the kangaroo knew that .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#63:1>
And after the whole spring had past , he understood more about the
rules of forest .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#64:1>
He didn't owe her anything .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#65:1>
He left the caterpillar , without saying one more word . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#66:1>
His legs were long .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#67:1>
After a few steps , he was already in another part of the forest .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#68:1>
But that distance for the caterpillar was so far that , it would take
her all her life time to reach there . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#69:1>
Since that day , she didn't see the kangaroo again , though she
kept waiting day by day on that tree , and everyday she lived in despair .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#70:1>
In late summer , she didn't know what was happening to herself .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#71:1>
She fell into a deep sleep .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#72:1>
She thought that she would never wake up , but after a month , she
woke up and found that she had turned into colorful butterfly . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#73:1>
Now , she could fly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#74:1>
The first thing she wanted to do was to find the kangaroo .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#75:1>
The distance which once would have taken a lifetime to travel , she
could now cover in a few minutes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#76:1>
Not far away , she saw him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#77:1>
She was so happy to see her friend again , but before going to meet
him , she decided to fly to the sky to get a cloud for him as a present .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#78:1>
She flew and flew , despite the brightness of the sun .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#79:1>
She saw the cloud .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#80:1>
This time , she saw a real cloud .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#81:1>
It was so big , so soft , so unreal .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#82:1>
It was very different from the cloud which the kangaroo had given her .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#83:1>
She didn't want that to be true .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#84:1>
&ldquo; Maybe there are other kinds of clouds .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#85:1>
Yes , the kangaroo took a month to get there , maybe that kind of
cloud , the best and the softest kind of cloud , is further up . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#86:1>
She flew higher and higher up .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#87:1>
The temperature was getting lower and lower , but she didn't give up .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#88:1>
Her wings became frozen by the cold , and finally become so fragile
that they broke off and fell down to the earth like ashes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#89:1>
At that moment , she looked down to the ground .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#90:1>
There was a field of soft white clouds .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#91:1>
And her friend , the kangaroo was there , waving to her and smiling .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#94:2>
Grace wanted desperately to go to the dinner party with her
parents and Diana , but her mother had said that more guests would only
create more trouble for the host .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#95:2>
Grace remembered that before the birth of her sister , who was seven
years younger than herself , her mother had treated her well .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#96:2>
Together , they read stories , went to the playground , and played
aeroplane chess .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#97:2>
All these happy events stopped once Diana was born .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#98:2>
Remembering her past happiness , Grace took the little box of
aeroplane chess from the shelf and played all four roles by herself .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#99:2>
Mother now played the game with Diana .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#100:2>
Everyday , Grace prayed she would be allowed to join the game , but
her wish was never fulfilled .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#101:2>
The dice dropped to the ground and rolled into a corner under the
sofa .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#102:2>
Grace saw a long silver earring .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#103:2>
A week ago , her mother had suspected her of stealing it and scolded
her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#104:2>
A well-behaved student at school , especially in comparison to Diana
, Grace could not understand her mother  ' s frequent accusations .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#105:2>
Thinking about this , she went into her mother  ' s bedroom , picked
up the make-up box from the bedside table and threw it out the bedroom door .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#106:2>
Then she opened the top drawer of the bedside table and began
throwing things .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#107:2>
Finally , she took the large chocolate coloured iron box , and using
her utmost strength , she threw it out of the door .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#108:2>
It hit Diana on the forehead heavily while she was sitting on the
sofa taking off her shoes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#109:2>
Grace did not know when her sister had come back .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#110:2>
The iron box burst open and a sheet of paper fell onto the ground .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#111:2>
Drops of blood mixed with Grace  ' s tears on the child adoption
certificate . </p> </I>

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#114:3>
I didn't want to wear the earrings .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#115:3>
I was too old for that , but Bonnie put them on for me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#116:3>
Mira bought them for her , but she was too young for pearls .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#117:3>
Mira wanted to bring them back to the shop , but it would be
impossible to find another pair as fine as these , so she decided to keep
them until Bonnie was old enough .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#118:3>
I went into the dining room , and Bonnie  ' s eyes widened .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#119:3>
With a big smile she cried , &lsquo; Let Grandma try those earrings!
&rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#120:3>
Mira laughed and handed her the earrings .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#121:3>
&lsquo; Be careful not to hurt Grandma . &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#122:3>
Bonnie pushed me gently into my room .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#123:3>
&lsquo; Bonnie , other people will laugh at me ! &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#124:3>
&lsquo; No , they will be jealous at how beautiful you are . &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#125:3>
I was embarrassed , but Bonnie made me sit down and put them on for
me slowly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#126:3>
&lsquo; There you go .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#127:3>
Gorgeous ! &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#128:3>
She stared at me with her radiant smile .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#129:3>
Mira also walked into the room to look .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#130:3>
The maid standing outside the room smiled at me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#131:3>
When I was a girl , my mother taught me that a woman should be
humble and not showy .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#132:3>
Although values had changed , I still felt uncomfortable when
everyone stared at me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#133:3>
However , I did feel excited .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#134:3>
I tried to hid my feelings , but the earrings were beautiful .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#135:3>
&lsquo; Where  ' s the mirror ? &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#136:3>
&lsquo; Here you go . &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#137:3>
I studied my face and looked at the earrings , which were made of
pearls edged with small diamonds .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#138:3>
I wore earrings when Bonnie was a child .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#139:3>
I took them off before I slept and put them on each morning .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#140:3>
What was the point for an old woman to wear earrings ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#141:3>
So I stopped wearing them .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#142:3>
This was the first pair I have worn after so many years , and also
the most expensive pair .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#143:3>
If my husband were still here , would he say that I was beautiful ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#144:3>
Or would he ask me to take them off ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#145:3>
&lsquo; We have to go now , &rsquo; Bonnie took my hand .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#146:3>
&lsquo; To where ? &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#147:3>
&lsquo; To the shopping mall .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#148:3>
You promised ! &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#149:3>
&lsquo; Bonnie , remember to take off the earrings for Grandma
tonight . &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#150:3>
&lsquo; Sure , Mom . &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#151:3>
Mira opened the door and Bonnie held my hand all the way .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#152:3>
Although I still missed him very much , I was not alone .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#153:3>
At least , I still had Bonnie and Mira . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#154:3>
We were tired after shopping and tried to find a restaurant for
dinner .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#155:3>
&lsquo; Look !

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#156:3>
Mom , let  ' s try Spanish food tonight ! &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#157:3>
Bonnie pointed at a restaurant .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#158:3>
&lsquo; Sure .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#159:3>
It looks good . &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#160:3>
&lsquo; You go first and see if there  ' s a table .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#161:3>
I will walk slowly with Grandma . &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#162:3>
To them , the restaurant was just in front of them .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#163:3>
But it took me a few minutes to get there .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#164:3>
When people grow old , their body functions also deteriorate .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#165:3>
If my husband were still here , he would massage my legs <->
everyday </-> <+> every day </+> .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#166:3>
Suddenly , a young man rushed in our direction .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#167:3>
I had no time to get away .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#168:3>
His arm hit my cheek slightly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#169:3>
&lsquo; Oh sorry, <it> Po Po </it> <fnr> <sp> 1 </sp> </fnr> !
&rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#170:3>
<footnote> Po Po : An address to old women </footnote>

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#171:3>
He continued running .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#172:3>
&lsquo; Grandma , are you okay ? &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#173:3>
&lsquo; Yes , &rsquo; I touch my cheek where it was hit and realized
something was missing when I touched my ears .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#174:3>
&lsquo; Bonnie , my earring is gone ! &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#175:3>
&lsquo; It must have fallen off when the guy bumped into you !
&rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#176:3>
Bonnie was looking onto the floor , searching for the earring .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#177:3>
I stood still , feeling helpless .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#178:3>
I had lost the earring that my children gave me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#179:3>
&lsquo; I found it ! &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#180:3>
Bonnie ran to the pick up the earring .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#181:3>
&lsquo; Here it is , lost and found . &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#182:3>
&lsquo; But the plug ! &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#183:3>
&lsquo; It  ' s on your hair ! &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#184:3>
She smiled and reached her hand to take the plug out of my hair .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#185:3>
She took my hand again and we walked to the restaurant . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-014#186:3>
That night , after Bonnie took off the earrings for me , I took
her hand and placed them on her palm .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#187:3>
&lsquo; I am really too old for that .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#188:3>
You should have them . &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#189:3>
&lsquo; No , Grandma , I can't , they are yours .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#190:3>
Mom said I  ' m still too young . &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#191:3>
&lsquo; I was already the mother of two children at your age .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#192:3>
You  ' re now a woman . &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#193:3>
Bonnie lowered her head and looked at the earrings .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#194:3>
Her eyes sparkled .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#195:3>
She closed her palm to hold the earrings tight , smiled and looked
at me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-014#196:3>
&lsquo; Grandma , I love you . &rsquo; </p> </I>
