<ICE-HK:W1B-029#1:1>
Dear <O> deleted </O> ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#2:1>
Thanks for your advice and help with this salary issue . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#3:1>
The job in question is a Product Manager plus IT/Networks/Computer
&ldquo; Manager" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#4:1>
Currently the Product Management job encompasses defining new
products &obrack;  features , RRP , market requirements etc. &cbrack; mainly for our PlayStation 2 range , but also for chess , bridge , battery chargers , i.e .
all the non PC controllers products .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#5:1>
The remit will expand to include Nintendo Game Boy Advance and Game
Cube , if we decide to develop this platform .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#6:1>
In addition , the job also includes following the development of these
products with the engineers , as well as continual customer support for basic
technical and market issues once the products have been launched .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#7:1>
The person , <O> deleted </O> , is also involved in the launch of
products and presentation to our customers &obrack;  mainly our distribution
companies &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#8:1>
The IT/network/computer part of the job has &ldquo; manager
&rdquo; written as such because he is mostly responsible but only has about
80&percent; authority .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#9:1>
He is the network administrator and generally considered the computer
guru .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#10:1>
Historically the computers have been handled by <O> deleted </O> ,
who now still maintains for the most part control over PC hardware purchase
decisions . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#11:1>
Therefore I have someone who really is doing 2 main jobs . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#12:1>
<O> deleted </O> has about 8 years working experience , 5 of
which has been with <O> deleted </O> .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#13:1>
He currently earns &dollar;36,900 per month , and he would like to be
earning at least &dollar;45,000 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#14:1>
He has some very good skills , but it  ' s difficult to keep him
motivated , as the salary is somewhat of an issue .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#15:1>
Moreover , <O> deleted </O> the big boss , has told him on several
occasions how important he is to the company , and that the company  ' s big
future earnings are in the console area &obrack;  PlayStation etc. &cbrack; , and that <O> deleted </O> is looking to him to make this area a success .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#16:1>
<O> deleted </O> also very highly rates his computer skills and
knowledge , and ranks him higher than the other Product Managers in the UK
office . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#17:1>
The problems are as follows: </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#18:1>
? A salary of &dollar;45,000 in the HK office is on the high side
, possibly even higher than some of the department managers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#19:1>
? I don't necessarily feel that the current structure with a
bunch of department managers as the senior managers is necessarily correct in
the whole scheme of things . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#20:1>
? <O> deleted </O> is the only person in HK that can sort out and
handle all the IT/network/computer issues and problems .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#21:1>
This is not a full time job , but it is necessary for the company .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#22:1>
? It would not be that easy to find someone who understands and
has a passion for the consoles products , that speaks and writes excellent
English and has a western mentality .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#23:1>
At least it would be quite difficult to find this type of person who
could stand working in <O> deleted </O> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#24:1>
Personally I feel that &dollar;45,000 is not totally outrageous ,
given the diversity of the job , and that if he were to be on a salary he  ' s
happy with , then I could get him to perform a lot better than what he is
currently doing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#25:1>
Anyway , I do appreciate if you could let me have your views and
some comparable salaries .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#26:1>
It would be good to know what blue chip companies as well as small
outfits pay somebody with a similar remit . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#27:1>
Thanks a lot for your time .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#63:5>
Dear Mr . <O> deleted </O> ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#64:5>
It is my understanding that you are one of the three directors of
Ah Pong and Company Limited , a private company registered in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#65:5>
My father , <O> deleted </O> &obrack;  name later changed to <O> deleted </O> )
, was also a director , as was Mr . <O> deleted </O> .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#66:5>
I understand that the company ceased trading in 1955 , but my father
continued to file the annual returns until 1997 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#67:5>
My father passed away in July 1998 , and I would like to close
the company so as to leave my father  ' s estate in an orderly state .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#68:5>
The Companies Registry informs me that whichever method chosen to
close a company , it is imperative that the directors initiate this action .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#69:5>
I am also trying to contact Mr . <O> deleted </O> , the other
director . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#70:5>
Please be assured that I will organise all the necessary
documents and pay all administration costs related to the closure of Ah Pong
and Company Limited .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#71:5>
All I require from you is your signature on the relevant documents .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#72:5>
Could you please contact me at your earliest convenience so that
I can proceed with the closure of this company .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#73:5>
Furthermore , if you have any knowledge of the whereabouts of Mr .
<O> deleted </O> , I would be much obliged if you could forward that
information to me . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#74:5>
Thanking you for your time and attention to this matter , I remain.

Dear Sir/Madam,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#114:11>
The above company has not had any trading activity since 1955 ,
although the annual returns have been filed up to 19th August 1997 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#115:11>
My father , Mr . <O> deleted </O> was one of the directors , and
the other two cannot be located .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#116:11>
Since my father passed away on 10th July 1998 , I have attempted on
several occasions to obtain information from your office about possible ways
of closing or de-registering this company .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#117:11>
To date , nobody has provided me with a satisfactory reply . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#118:11>
I enclose , for your reference , the following documents:

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#119:11>
? Copy of <O> deleted </O>  ' s death certificate

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#120:11>
? Copy of the letters sent to the other two directors , Mr . <O>
deleted </O> and Mr . <O> deleted </O> , at their last known addresses

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#121:11>
? Copy of delivery notes from DHL and UPS indicating that the two
other directors no longer reside at their respective addresses </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#122:11>
I was informed , in a telephone conversation with your office ,
that a director  ' s signature is required to file annual returns and that a
director  ' s signature is required to initiate the closure or de-registration
of the company .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#123:11>
Furthermore , I was also informed that the estate of a defunct
director would not be held liable for any failure to comply with Companies
Registry regulations . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#124:11>
I would now appreciate a written confirmation of the above two
points , as well as some clear procedures and directions for closing /
de-registering this company . </p>

I am in receipt of your letter dated 14th May , referenced
above , relating to the non-filing of the 1998 annual return from Ah Pong and
Company . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#139:13>
The company has not had any trading activity since 1955 , and
the company has not been wound up , as two of the three directors can not be
located . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#140:13>
One of the directors , Mr . <O> deleted </O> , my father , has
been filing the annual returns since that time .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#141:13>
He passed away on 10th July 1998 , a copy of his death certificate
is enclosed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#142:13>
Therefore in the absence of any of the directors , it has not
been possible to take any action with this company .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#143:13>
Could you please advise what procedures I need to follow in order
to settle this issue . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#144:13>

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#170:17> Dear Ms . <O> deleted </O> ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#171:17> <O> deleted </O> would be very happy to offer a work experience
placement for one student from 21st Febrauury to 3rd March . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#172:17> In order that your student not be disillusioned , it may be
helpful to brief them on our working environment and style .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#173:17> <O> deleted </O> is a medium sized manufacturing company with about
70 employees in HK .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#174:17> Our offices are located in an industrial zone and there is nothing
glamourous here .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#175:17> The majority of communications within the company is in Cantonese ,
and the jobs that we will give your student will be basically a lot of very
clerical tasks , such as filing and photocopying .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#176:17> We would also like the student to go to other departments and get
information , therefore they should be prepared to communicate well .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#177:17> It doesn't matter if he or she cannot speak Cantonese , as most
colleagues do speak English .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#178:17> Obviously if the student does have PC application skills , we will
assign data updating tasks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-029#179:17> Basically I do not want your student to expect to be involved
in high level decision making or nay other high profile jobs , and thus be
disappointed .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#180:17> I  ' m afraid this is the reality of the working environment for
someone without any prior working experience .

<ICE-HK:W1B-029#181:17> Otherwise , the atmosphere is very relaxed and friendly , and it is
really up to him or her to take the initiative and join in with our team .
