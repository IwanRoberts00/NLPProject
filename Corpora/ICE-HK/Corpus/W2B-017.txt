<bold> WHENEVER THE </bold> Court of Final Appeal &obrack;  CFA &cbrack; 
deliberates on any immigration case , it too is on trial .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#5:1>
On trial , that is , in the court of public opinion .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#6:1>
No one forgets what happened in 1999 when the still-untested CFA
interpreted the Basic Law broadly in recognising the right of abode for tens
of thousands of mainland children born to permanent residents of Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#7:1>
The Government almost immediately challenged the verdict by applying
to the Standing Committee of the National People  ' s Congress &obrack;  NPC &cbrack; to
overrule the CFA , so compromising judicial integrity in the eyes of many .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#8:1>
The CFA realised that its credibility was under scrutiny again
when on July 20 it reached a pair of controversial and conflicting verdicts
concerning a child and a teenager whose plights have gripped the public .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#9:1>
The court in the first instance ruled that Chong Fung-yuen could stay
, even though his parents ostensibly only came to Hong Kong as visitors in
order to give birth to him . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#10:1>
The court decision astounded the Government , which was concerned
that thousands of other pregnant visitors from the mainland would now seek to
circumvent the law in the same way .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#11:1>
The administration is justifiably worried because Hong Kong is under
a constant state of immigration siege .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#12:1>
Many claiming the right of abode guaranteed by the Basic Law demand
urgent redress on compelling legal , constitutional and moral grounds .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#13:1>
To let the CFA verdict stand would only complicate a very difficult
situation and might undermine an orderly programme of family reunion . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#14:1>
In the past four years , there have been 2,202 reported cases -
232 involving illegal immigrants - of mainland women delivering babies in
Hong Kong and seeking the right of abode for their offspring and , eventually
, themselves .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#15:1>
The Government cannot encourage this trend when it is already
struggling to accommodate more than 150 legal arrivals from the mainland
every day within overtaxed social , health care , housing and education
services .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#16:1>
I have been one of those advocating a radical review of the current
immigration policy and the addition of a new category of investors and
skilled workers to generate the revenue to help defray some of the costs of
catering for these people . </p> <O> A photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#17:1>
What we cannot accept is a &ldquo; pregnancy backdoor &rdquo;
through which some can get ahead of others in the long queue for family
reunion .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#18:1>
Privilege for one may be justice denied for many more .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#19:1>
But though the Government did not want to make an exemption for
Fung-yuen , it has nonetheless opted not to challenge the CFA ruling by
seeking another interpretation of the Basic Law from the NPC Standing
Committee . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#20:1>
Director of Immigration Ambrose Lee Siu-kwong has also promised
to be extra vigilant and , with the co-operation of mainland authorities ,
stop pregnant women from slipping into Hong Kong on two-way permits to give
birth and seek the right of abode .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#21:1>
To be lax is to invite abuse and deepen the injury to the aggrieved
tens of thousands of permanent residents with split families and no immediate
prospect of uniting with their loved ones in Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#22:1>
On July 20 , the CFA also reached another landmark decision in
consenting to the repatriation of 14-year-old Agnes Tam Nga-yin , a studious
pupil cherished by her classmates and teachers who have mobilised public
opinion in her defence .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#23:1>
All of us were touched by the campaign for Agnes as hundreds of
people signed petitions , spread the word on the Internet and appealed for an
exemption .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#24:1>
To them , it would be cruel to wrest the girl from her loving parents
and return her to a place that is now alien and would hold an uncertain
future . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#25:1>
The court , however , had no choice but to agree with the
Government that the right of abode is for biological rather than adopted
children of permanent residents .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#26:1>
Many disagree with the judicial decision and also with the Government .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#27:1>
They say the principle of equality enshrined in law does not
discriminate against children , adopted or not . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#28:1>
I understand the Government  ' s quandary in wanting to be
compassionate and yet not wanting to tempt those who could fake adoptions - a
common ploy for many in getting around immigration restrictions now and in
years gone by .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#29:1>
For the sake of consistency , Secretary for Security Regina Ip Lau
Suk-yee has indicated the Government may opt to exercise its discretion by
not deporting Agnes who , like Fung-yuen , is not responsible for her
predicament and should not be punished . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#30:1>
The judges also mulled over the morals of the question and
mitigating factors before reaching two opposite decisions on letting the boy
stay while asking the girl to leave .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#31:1>
No two cases are exactly alike .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#32:1>
Exemptions for Fung-yuen and Agnes do not mean automatic waivers for
others .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#33:1>
I applaud the Government for heeding the views of the public , and
declaring that the cases of Fung-yuen and Agnes are exceptional and do not
mean any change to its current immigration policy and right-of-abode criteria .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#34:1>
We live in a flawed world in which not everyone gets the breaks
he or she deserves .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#35:1>
But Agnes and Fung-yuen are no longer statistics .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#36:1>
The girl and the boy are bonded to Hong Kong and it would be wrong to
deprive either their opportunity to grow up in their city and among people
who evidently cherish them .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#37:1>
Sometimes in life all we can do is make not a major impact , but a
small difference as our conscience dictates and as humanity requires .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#38:1>
Hong Kong is Agnes and Fung-yuen  ' s home .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#39:1>
Others in the same situation might not be so lucky because there is a
limit to tolerance and there is also the law . </p>

<bold> ALTHOUGH THE </bold> Legislative Council is often divided
, in May it passed - with a large majority - a Liberal Party motion to ease
the way for more mainland visitors and investors to come to Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#45:2>
The Hong Kong Tourism Board , to its credit , promptly asked to have
the daily quota of 1,500 travellers from the mainland either scrapped or
raised to 2,000 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#46:2>
The latter will now happen , from September 1 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#47:2>
On Friday , the Government then launched an &dollar;18 billion
programme to beautify every district for tourism .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#48:2>
Financial Secretary Antony Leung Kam-chung last week went to Beijing
to discuss with the central Government a range of issues , tourism and
investment prominent among them .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#49:2>
Both sides are now ironing out the details on multiple-entry visas
for businessmen and reduced hassles for tourists . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#50:2>
All this is heartening .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#51:2>
But what is not is mainland tourist operators ' complaints that their
customers are being ripped off or discriminated against in Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#52:2>
The abuse of visitors blackens our reputation , casts a shadow
over our relations with the mainland and sabotages the expensive promotion of
our &ldquo; City of Life" .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#53:2>
What counts is not the hospitality we pledge but the hospitality we
deliver .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#54:2>
We have to make word of mouth work for , rather than against , Hong
Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#55:2>
I am aggrieved but not surprised by the contempt some of our
people , not only merchants , show to our compatriots .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#56:2>
We all have a bank of memories about rude relatives from the &ldquo;
home &rdquo; villages , their uncouth manners and demands on our generosity &obrack; 
also known as &ldquo; obligations" &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#57:2>
While China has changed , bias , maybe even bigotry , has not as our
Chinese-language media , reflecting our own prejudices , continue to
caricature mainlanders as &ldquo; simpletons" , &ldquo; hicks &rdquo; and
&ldquo; bumpkins" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#58:2>
Stories circulating on the mainland about Hong Kong swindlers are
perhaps exaggerated but these are nonetheless gaining credence by their
repetition .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#59:2>
Chastened visitors talk about surly clerks who reserve their smiles
for other customers; about having inferior goods fobbed on them for high
prices; the switching of camera lenses; the passing-off of jewellery as pure
gold when it isn't and other similar examples . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#60:2>
These cases , while isolated , portray Hong Kong as a grabbing ,
pushy place , a stereotype that some of our workers in the tourist trade have
done little to dispel . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#61:2>
Morally , the mistreatment of visitors is repugnant and
overcharging is tantamount to fraud or theft .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#62:2>
Financially , this can be ruinous for Hong Kong because mainlanders
are our most numerous patrons .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#63:2>
Back in 1998 , when the mainland tourist boom began , some 2.7
million of them visited , increasing to 3.2 million in 1999 , 3.8 million
last year and a projected four million this year .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#64:2>
They now constitute a third of our visitors and this portion could
well increase as mainland wealth rises . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#65:2>
Another factor which could increase the ratio of mainland
visitors is the recession , which might convince those from Europe , North
America , Australia , Japan and elsewhere in Asia to stay away . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#66:2>
Economically , our future hinges on prosperity in China , which
is poised to join the World Trade Organisation later this year .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#67:2>
We are witnessing and benefiting from the emergence of a mainland
middle class , which in the first six months of this year bought 345,000
private cars , a 30.7 per cent rise from the same period last year .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#68:2>
Mainland investments , which have soared by more than 15 per cent in
the first half of this year , will sustain growth initially fuelled by
foreign capital .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#69:2>
Mainland property sales rose by 28.2 per cent in contrast to the
stagnant real estate market in Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#70:2>
As mainland Chinese live better and earn more , they aspire to
experience the world , both close to and far from home .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#71:2>
This wanderlust is reflected in the fact that the Chinese authorities
registered 450 billion yuan &obrack;  about HK&dollar;420 billion &cbrack; in domestic
tourism and tourist-related revenue last year .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#72:2>
Of this amount , Chinese people visiting other mainland sites
generated 330 billion yuan . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#73:2>
Hong Kong nowadays is not unrivalled as a Chinese destination .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#74:2>
It must vie with the likes of Shanghai , Guangzhou and Beijing to
attract more discerning mainland tourists . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#75:2>
Many Chinese from the north are frustrated with the difficulties
facing them when it comes to visiting Hong Kong , where they are often
treated with suspicion .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#76:2>
They say it seems easier for them to jet to Los Angeles for Disney
theme parks than to cross the border into the SAR .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#77:2>
Surveys among Chinese travellers place France and the United States
as choice destinations , not Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#78:2>
Throughout the region , countries are wooing mainland visitors who
find they are valued in places like Singapore , Thailand and Malaysia . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#79:2>
Not only is Hong Kong sometimes unfriendly to mainland visitors ,
it is also expensive .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#80:2>
The fare and other costs for a typical train trip to Hong Kong from
nearby Guangdong province costs around &dollar;1,500 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#81:2>
The same traveller can fly to Bangkok and stay for five days and
nights at a hotel for a comparable amount during the off season .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#82:2>
We have to do more to bring in tourist business because we cannot
continue to take for granted mainland patronage . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#83:2>
Our Government can help our tourist trade compete for China  ' s
custom by lifting restrictions and waiving some fees but it cannot , on its
own , change public attitudes manifest in the shoddy treatment of mainland
visitors . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#84:2>
In this respect , we can only help ourselves by according
travellers equal respect and by educating our youngsters not to discriminate .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#85:2>
We must open our hearts to our visitors , not only because we desire
their patronage , but also because we are courteous and civil . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#86:2>
What the Government can also do is to try even harder to entice
mainland individuals to immigrate and invest in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#87:2>
Their rental or purchase of office space , location of executives
here , and recruitment of our workers will boost our economy and forge a
perfect partnership between the mainland , with its vast market , and the SAR
, with its financial expertise and cosmopolitan flair . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#92:3>
The report on higher education in Hong Kong , issued by the
University Grants Committee , is the latest in a long line of
government-commissioned prescriptions for healing an ailing patient , with
one distinct difference: the report  ' s prognosis comes principally from a
foreign physician . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#93:3>
The jury is still out on the Sutherland report , but it has
already generated heated debate among pundits and university administrators
on a number of issues , among them the controversial Credit Accumulation and
Transfer System &obrack;  CATS &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#94:3>
CATS permits students to enrol in courses away from their home
institutions , with the latter being subsidised for each additional student
admitted under the scheme .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#95:3>
This system , advocates insist , would allow students a greater
degree of academic choice and enhances flexibility in learning .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#96:3>
Who can dispute the value of heightened choice and flexibility , two
cardinal principles of academic freedom , indeed the foundation of modern-
day higher education ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#97:3>
However , as a detractor , I see at least two potential problems
in this recommendation; too much freedom placed in the hands of students and
, more importantly , the plan risks promoting an erroneous trend - the
commercialisation of higher education in Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#98:3>
Currently , universities lack structured and rigorous mechanisms
to ensure the quality of their teaching .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#99:3>
Different institutions operate in various ways , each with distinct
standards for measuring excellence .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#100:3>
In my view , local universities , whether in principle or in
practice , possess neither a core curriculum nor distribution requirements
that ensure students a comprehensive education .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#101:3>
As a result , course offerings are fragmented and unco-ordinated .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#102:3>
While CATS encourages selection , it offers undergraduates too much
freedom of choice without providing appropriate guidance for achieving a
balanced education . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#103:3>
Another problematic aspect of CATS is the subsidising of
institutions based on their number of &ldquo; outside students" .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#104:3>
At a time of drastic budget cuts , a decrease in government funding
and few private endowments available , the tuition of every student counts .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#105:3>
Hence the increasing danger of institutions being tempted to offer
&ldquo; soft courses &rdquo; and hand out high grades in order to draw more
outside students . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#106:3>
Soon local universities will be competing for more and more
students and higher education will become a consumer market eager to please
its valuable student customers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#107:3>
Such a scenario runs counter to the very core of current educational
reform . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#108:3>
CATS also spells trouble for &ldquo; unpopular &rdquo; courses ,
especially in the humanities .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#109:3>
The study of literature , history and philosophy have long been
erroneously perceived as an exercise in folly , for , in an age of advanced
scientific and cyberspace technology , such endeavours are deemed &ldquo;
impractical &rdquo; and &ldquo; useless" .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#110:3>
The humanities apparently no longer matter , especially in Hong Kong
, where value is defined by the dollar sign .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#111:3>
Sadly , we live in a world that dismisses cultural values while
consumerism runs amok .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#112:3>
The proposed CATS may encourage students to take courses deemed
&ldquo; fashionable &rdquo; and " practical" , thus further commercialising
higher education in line with market needs . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#113:3>
This misguided effort points to the root cause of our current
education woes: promoting students ' trendy disciplines and narrowly
specialised knowledge that cater to a profit-maximising , consumer-glutted
society .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#114:3>
In the classroom , we are often frequently appalled by our students'
declining language skills , lack of general knowledge , obsession with grades
, and , worse still , absence of intellectual curiosity and critical acumen .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#115:3>
This troubling situation is the result of a rigid educational
system .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#116:3>
One possible remedy , I would argue , is a return to teaching the
basics; writing , communications and reasoning .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#117:3>
The time-honoured humanities surely offers a much-needed solution
as well , for they teach students to speak articulately , to write coherently
and to think analytically .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#118:3>
Moreover , they remind students that a balanced university education
is more than learning a profession or marketable skills; they must also
instil &ldquo; energies of mind &rdquo; that can steer technology and
economic development along a more humane path .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#119:3>
The goal of tertiary education is not just to get a better job but
rather to help students find fulfilment in their lives as they navigate
through an ever changing and unpredictable world . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-017#120:3>
Students ' propensity to take only &ldquo; fashionable &rdquo;
courses , such as marketing , may serve them in the practical world but it
will not make them well-educated individuals .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#121:3>
Implementing the CATS proposal risks the spread of shallow
vocationalism and the promotion of consumer-driven learning .

<ICE-HK:W2B-017#122:3>
If this system is adopted without simultaneously introducing
mechanisms of quality control and , more importantly , a balanced curriculum
, the prognosis for our students is grim indeed . </p>
