<it> Time for Beijing to recognise Legco </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#2:1>
THE British Prime Minister , Mr John Major , said in his press
conference in Hong Kong after visiting Beijing that he had urged the Chinese
Government to recognize the status of the Omelco. His words have somehow
raised optimism that the warming Sino-British relations would help Omelco
gain Beijing  ' s recognition . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#3:1>
It is now time to rethink the whole issue of the Omelco  ' s status,
not because of Mr Major  ' s words but the fundamentally altered nature of the
Legislative Council after this month  ' s direct elections . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#4:1>
In the eyes of Beijing officials , the Executive and Legislative
Councils of Hong Kong are colonial establishments and they do not represent
the opinions or interests of Hong Kong people . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#5:1>
Yes , they were colonial institutions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#6:1>
Before 1985 , all unofficial members of the Exco and the Legco were
handpicked by the Governor .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#7:1>
They were not there to represent the citizens , nor to rule or oppose
, but to assist the governance of the colony . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#8:1>
The Chinese leaders were never shy about their attitude towards
the councillors .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#9:1>
Back in 1982 , Mr Deng Xiaoping bluntly told Sir Sze-yuen Chung , the
then Senior Exco Member who led an Umelco delegation to Beijing , that they
did not represent the people of Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#10:1>
In 1988 and 1989 , when the now defunct Basic Law Consultative
Committee was canvassing public opinion on the draft Basic Law , the Omelco  ' s
position papers were given no special status .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#11:1>
And last year when an the Omelco delegation visited Guangdong , they
were not received in its official capacity . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#12:1>
Given the nature of the Omelco , nobody should have any illusion
that Beijing would accept its representativeness .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#13:1>
However, the 18 newly elected members returned by popular votes
earlier this month have put Legco on a completely different footing . </p>
<h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#14:1>
<ul> Opportunities Exposed </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#15:1>
Almost one-third of the Legco members are now directly elected ,
significantly raising its legitimacy as a representative public forum .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#16:1>
This is also a giant step for Hong Kong in shredding its colonial
past as far as public policy formulation is concerned . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#17:1>
In addition , the composition of the Legco is already close to
the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
as stipulated in the Basic Law .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#18:1>
The new Legco should take advantage of its new composition , its
added legitimacy and the recovering Sino-British relations to open a dialogue
with the Chinese authorities on the issue of its status . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#19:1>
On the other hand , it is also time for Beijing to rethink its
policy on the Omelco .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#20:1>
To continue refusing to establish links with the Legco is not in Hong
Kong  ' s best interest . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#21:1>
Beijing might still be wary of the politicians who organized
rallies in support of the Beijing student demonstrations in 1989 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#22:1>
But it should be noted that quite a number of them have toned down
their criticisms on China in their election campaigns .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#23:1>
And almost none of them had tried to exploit radical anti-China
slogans in their campaigns to market themselves to the electorate .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#24:1>
It could be argued that these are gestures of good will . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#25:1>
The climate is about right to mend fences .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#26:1>
Given the fact that there are only six years before Hong Kong people
rule their own place , it is high time for the British and Chinese
Governments to cooperate in breeding the right leadership here . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#27:1>
The emergence of a core of political leaders takes time but
obviously time is not on the side of Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#28:1>
As long as the past relations between Beijing and the Legco is not
changed , the Legco will not be able to assume an effective leadership role
in the transition period and whether the ideal of &ldquo; Hong Kong people
ruling Hong Kong &rdquo; could be materialized will be thrown into doubt .
</p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#29:1>
<ul> Contradictory Policies </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#30:1>
&ldquo; Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong &rdquo; is the official
policy of Beijing on Hong Kong after 1997 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#31:1>
But what was exemplified in the airport controversy &dash; that both
the autonomy of the Hong Kong Government and the role of Legco were
diminished &dash; has cast doubts on how successful the policy could be
implemented in the future . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#32:1>
Apart from the much-mentioned worries that Beijing will get used
to meddling in the domestic matters of Hong Kong from now on , the minimal
role of the Hong Kong Government and the Legco in resolving the controversy
had also clouded the confidence of Hong Kong people . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#33:1>
The controversy surrounding the Chek Lap Kok new airport was
finally resolved through diplomatic channels between China and Britain .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#34:1>
The squabble did not officially end until the top leaders of the two
countries signed the Memorandum of Understanding in Beijing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#35:1>
All along , banking on the repeated mistakes of the Hong Kong
Government , Beijing gave an impression that it deliberately tried to , and
successfully , shun the Hong Kong Government and take the issue to the
highest diplomatic level . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#36:1>
The dispute dramatically resolved after the visit of Sir Percy
Cradock , the Prime Minister  ' s Foreign Affairs Adviser , to Beijing. And it
took the Prime Minister to fly to the Chinese capital to sign a memorandum of
understanding , which is not a particularly high level diplomatic document ,
on an airport project in a tiny colony . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#37:1>
Of course one can argue that the airport project is vital to the
stability and prosperity of Hong Kong and Hong Kong is the single most
important issue between London and Beijing .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#38:1>
But nonetheless Beijing  ' s policy on the airport controversy is
widely perceived as not merely an attempt to strike a dea1 on the airport
proper but also a grand initiative to reverse diplomatic adversity against
London . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#39:1>
No doubt Beijing has won the battle .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#40:1>
But the price may be a bit too high for Hong Kong as it was left with
a much diminished autonomy in administering the project on its own . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#41:1>
The airport committee under the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group
has replaced the Government House and the Lower Albert Road on major
decisions and the airport consultative committee has effectively displaced
the Legislative Council in monitoring the project .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#42:1>
This problematic scenario brings us back to the discussion of the new
Legco after this month  ' s direct elections . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#43:1>
The Legco now has a majority of elected members .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#44:1>
It was virtually left with no job or was effectively preempted in
this major project .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#45:1>
The consultative committee is an advisory body appointed by the
Governor &obrack; after consulting Beijing &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#46:1>
But it has been given a job to monitor a project said to be vital to
the future of Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#47:1>
This is at least bizarre , if not absurd . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#48:1>
According to the Basic Law , the Legco , not consultative
committee of any sort , is one of the constitutional pillars in Hong Kong
after 1997 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#49:1>
But the solution to the airport dispute runs contrary to the
establishment of this pillar , which would turn to threaten the success of
realizing &ldquo; Hong Kong People Ruling Hong Kong &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#50:1>
All these at least partly stemmed from China  ' s refusal to
recognize the Legco  ' s representativeness and legitimacy , which gives rise
to the need for establishing the kind of replacement setup such as a
consultative committee .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#51:1>
This position is justifiable in the past , but not now and onwards .
</p> </I>

<I> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#52:2>
Why sacrifice the airport for oligarchy ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#53:2>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#54:2>
At the time of this writing , the British and Chinese Governments
have yet to resume discussions on the new airport project .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#55:2>
The secrecy of these talks , which is reminiscent of the Sino-British
negotiations over Hong Kong  ' s future , makes it difficult to know exactly
what is being considered by both sides , and if either are offering any real
concessions . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#56:2>
However , the British and Hong Kong Governments apparently are
trying hard to paint a picture wherein they must choose between a new airport
and the authority to effectively administer the territory in the run up to
1997 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#57:2>
This impression is being created by occasional comments from
allegedly &ldquo; informed persons &rdquo; , by the British Foreign Secretary
Mr. Douglas Hurd during his visit , and top local Government officials and
Executlve Councillors . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#58:2>
But are these the only two options ? </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#59:2>
<ul> The Government  ' s Losing Bet </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#60:2>
Recently expressed public opinions indicate that the public is
pointing its finger at the Hong Kong Government for messing up the airport
project . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#61:2>
There is little doubt that one reason for the confusion over the
airport is that the Hong Kong Government mishandled relations with China on
the issue .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#62:2>
More and more opinions are being expressed blaming the Government for
not actively and constructively seeking early consultation with the Chinese
Government on the project . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#63:2>
The unexpected announcement of building the Lantau Fixed Crossing
linking Kowloon and the proposed Chek Lap Kok airport by public funds on the
eve of the Sino-Hong Kong expert group meeting last October dealt a fatal
blow to smoother cooperations between Hong Kong and China on the new airport .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#64:2>
Against such a backdrop .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#65:2>
it came as no surprise that an opinion poll commissioned by the South
China Morning Post &obrack; SCMP &cbrack; published on April 29 shows that
the public  ' s rating of Government performance has plunged .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#66:2>
In addition , the poll indicates support for making concessions ,
although unspecified , to the Chinese side . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#67:2>
This may indicate that the public is dissatisfied with the way
the Hong Kong Government is handling relations with China .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#68:2>
In addition , the public seems to understand well that diplomacy
requires a constant give-and-take , diplomacy with China included . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#69:2>
These public sentiments do not support the reported position of
the Government , which is that there can be no trade-off whatsoever between
&ldquo; effective &rdquo; administration and a replacement airport . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#70:2>
It seems that the Government is betting on the possibility that
Hong Kong people would prefer keeping the existing decision-making mechanism
&obrack; which the Government calls &ldquo; effective &ldquo; administration
&cbrack; intact to embracing a new airport which is still on consultants  ' 
paper .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#71:2>
But the SCMP survey indicates that the Government may have lost its
bet . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#72:2>
One may wonder why Hong Kong people do not favour an &ldquo;
effective administration &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#73:2>
But let it not be forgotten that the way the Government handled the
new airport project exemplifies those aspects of the colonial decision-making
process which should not be duplicated .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#74:2>
Nor should we sacrifice the airport project in order to keep this
form of Government . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#75:2>
To date , the public is still kept in the dark on the
decision-making process .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#76:2>
The Government cites technicalities as the reason for not disclosing
more information .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#77:2>
The Government has kept details to themselves .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#78:2>
Even Legislative Councillors complain that they are kept in the dark .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#79:2>
Is such a colonial style oligarchy what the Hong Kong public
wants ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#80:2>
Doubtful .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#81:2>
But if oligarchy is what the Government wants, the Government should
not expect support from the public when it finds itself tackling the airport
controversy on its own . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#82:2>
What Hong Kong people want to see is a more open government at
home and a smooth and constructive cooperation between China and Hong Kong on
major matters affecting the transition .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#83:2>
They also want a viable new airport project to carry Hong Kong into
the next century .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#84:2>
These two things need not be mutually exclusive . </p> <O> photograph
</O> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#85:2>
<ul> Effective Administration Means Being Able To Deal With China
</ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#86:2>
To be effective , the Administration must have the authority to
make decisions regarding domestic affairs , and the ability to get things
done .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#87:2>
To complete major plans , such as the airport , which straddle 1997
requires the Government to both exercise its authority and win the support of
the Chinese Government . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#88:2>
The Government  ' s reported position of threatening to shelve the
new airport project only serves to illustrate the Government  ' s
short-sightedness and poor diplomatic behavior when faced with a tough
negotiator . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#89:2>
It is high time the Government reviewed its China policy and
demonstrated an ability to mend fences with the Chinese Government .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#90:2>
This is particularly important now because Hong Kong is already in
the second phase of the transition period. The Government is not forced to
choose between an effective administration and a new airport .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#91:2>
But it is forcing itself into a corner by refusing to realise that to
steer Hong Kong through this transition period , it must change its colonial
style of administering Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-018#92:2>
Keeping China at bay and making decisions behind closed doors is
the easy way out .

<ICE-HK:W2A-018#93:2>
Maintaining creative and constructive relations with Beijing , albeit
more difficult , requires leadership skills the colonial government does not
have at the moment . </p> </I>
