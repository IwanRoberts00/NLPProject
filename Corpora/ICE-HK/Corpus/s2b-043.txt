Can they keep their customers satisfied

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#2:1:A>
From a system administrator  ' s office to the users  '  desktops
messaging systems have promises to keep

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#3:1:A>
It won't be easy to live up to the promise LAN-base e-mail products
systems that let LAN users send and receive electronic messages must gain
acceptance from two group that rarely see anything eye to eye end users and
system administrators

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#4:1:A>
Walk into any organization and ask about what kind of e-mail system
to buy and you would likely to find users and administrators in a face-off
<,> waving their individual agendas

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#5:1:A>
End users have straightforward needs

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#6:1:A>
They want a quick and easy way of exchanging messages <,> messages
and files with colleagues <,> from the desktops

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#7:1:A>
They want to store and organize those messages in folders or
compressed archives

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#8:1:A>
And once the messages are stored they need to be able to search and
retrieve quickly the information they need for that Monday morning meeting

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#9:1:A>
Finally they don't want to devote entire week workdays to becoming
proficient at managing their mail

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#10:1:A>
By contrast system administrators the people who sit behind the
glass door and make the mail system work favor packages that are easy to
install configure maintain and manage

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#11:1:A>
What administrators think is important

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#12:1:A>
Efficient use of disc storage providing a reasonable level of
security and managing connections to other e-mail systems is usually of
little interest to end users as long as the system works smoothly

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#13:1:A>
In this round-up on e-mail packages we  ' ll look at the issue form
both <,> perspectives assigning two reviewers to look at each package

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#14:1:A>
One approach it from an end user  ' s point of view performing a
series of task from the <.> desk </.> desktop while the other concentrate on
installing maintaining and optimizing the system together the perspective and
administrator would have from behind the glass door

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#15:1:A>
The products reviewed here or run on Intel-based PC mail <?>
service </?> across <.> No </.> Novell  ' s Netware version three dot eleven

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#16:1:A>
They offer interfaces to both DOS and Windows users

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#17:1:A>
Support at least an MHS gateway and offer remote <,> user access to
the company  ' s e-mail system <,> via a dial-up program that can be installed
at a distance site

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#18:1:A>
The products we reviewed here include Beyond  ' s BeyondMail for DOS
and BeyondMail for Windows Lotus Development Corp  ' s ccMail for DOS and
ccMail for Windows Da Vinci System Corp  ' s Da Vinci eMail for DOS and Da
Vinci </?> uh <?> Da Vinci eMail for Windows Futurus Corp  ' s Futurus Team DOS
Windows Combo Microsoft Corp  ' s Microsoft Mail for PC Networks <.> No </.>
Notework Corp  ' s Notework Windows DOS Combo and WordPerfect Corp  ' s
WordPerfect Office

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#19:1:A>
All of this products have mastered the basic of <.> me </.>
messaging but in the battle for the hearts and <?> miles </?> and minds of
both system administrators and end users none were universally embraced by
both

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#20:1:A>
The engine that drive an e-mail system must have two basic
components

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#21:1:A>
A specialized data-based to store and forward messages and a
mechanism to route that messages to the appropriate address on the network

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#22:1:A>
Each e-mail message is actually a record in the message database

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#23:1:A>
Its address message content subject line and other elements are
fields in that record

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#24:1:A>
In practice the data-base often stores only the message headers
along with pointers to the message text which is stored like a database memo
<?> field </?> in an external file

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#25:1:A>
Behind the glass door

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#26:1:A>
Acting as a sort of postmaster general the administrator manages
the database and creates the and maintains a global address directory that
leads the e-mail addresses of everyone on the system

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#27:1:A>
The administrators the administrator also creates and manages the
user profiles which are <.> re </.> records that includes such informations
such information as where each user  ' s individual post office is located and
how much disc storage spaces are located to each user

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#28:1:A>
The routing mechanism transports the mail

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#29:1:A>
It can be a proprietary system build into a specific e-mail product
or modular one like MHS that pick it back onto the network operating system

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#30:1:A>
There are <.> advanta </.> there are advantages and disadvantages
to both

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#31:1:A>
BeyondMail and Da Vinci eMail are examples of a program that have
no transport mechanism of their own

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#32:1:A>
They rely exclusively on MHS for message routing

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#33:1:A>
For the administrator the inconvenience of installing Novell Ms
Novell  ' s MHS on a network is offset by convenient features such as ability
to encrypt messages during transport

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#34:1:A>
The more complex the e-mail system the bigger the convenience
dividends in using <,,> in <.> M </.> in using MHS

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#35:1:A>
For example MHS-based system can read the MHS directory to create a
post office address book in seamless transparent manner

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#36:1:A>
ccMail which uses a proprietary transport system is the first non
<.> M </.> MHS system to read the NetWare Bindery the operating system  ' s own
database of user and enter the information into its own directory

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#37:1:A>
This spares the administrators from doing it

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#38:1:A>
But when you depend on MHS you can offer only those features that
MHS supports

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#39:1:A>
Microsoft Mail three dot zero  ' s sophisticated transfer transport
layer can include more complex files types in messages

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#40:1:A>
This <,,> free the user from having to use binary <,> attachment
<,> if for instance they would like to include a worksheet with the message

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#41:1:A>
As graphics sound and even video become an integral part of e-mail
communications Microsoft Mail will have a jump on the <.> com </.>
competition

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#42:1:A>
User will be able to launch applications and view the files from
within their messages

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#43:1:A>
Quotidian tasks

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#44:1:A>
<,,> Of all the day to day jobs that a system administrator must
perform deleting old messages to free storage space is one of the most
essential and tedious

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#45:1:A>
Any help from the <,> software can provide is a boon <,,> is a boon

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#46:1:A>
BeyondMail assists with a <.> ma ma </.> with a macro that warns
both administrator and end user when the latter  ' s mailbox when the when the
<.> la </.> when the latter  ' s mailbox is full

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#47:1:A>
And ccMail features a reclaim utility an administrator can run to
consolidate message-storing space in the same way that a disc optimizer <?>
defragments </?> files

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#48:1:A>
Another major administrator  ' s task although it only occur during
set up is creating the global address book for the system

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#49:1:A>
Any automated way of doing it such as importing user data from the
NetWare Bindery or another external database is a big plus

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#50:1:A>
More than half of the packages we reviewed feature some sort of
utility to migrate the data from the Netware Bindery

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#51:1:A>
But perhaps most important in the ongoing maintenance of the system
is the administrator  ' s ability to back up the mail system and repair the
message database when its integrity is violated

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#52:1:A>
The e-mail universe

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#53:1:A>
Privacy is always a concern in a shared environment and this is
especially true of a e-mail

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#54:1:A>
Most e-mail system offer at least <,> <.> ru </.> rudimentary
password-base security

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#55:1:A>
But this rarely protects messages from the eyes of those who have
supervisory rights to the system

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#56:1:A>
Microsoft mail encrypts messages and when run under Microsoft LAN
Manager also hides the data files

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#57:1:A>
WordPerfect Office allow users to encrypt files by assigning
messages one of five level of privacy from normal to for your eyes only

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#58:1:A>
Single products running on single LANs often <unc> one-word
</unc> encompass linked <?> services </?> other e-mails other e-mail
systems and communication with remote sites

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#59:1:A>
As the e-mail universe expands <?> connectivity </?> increases but
administrative problems multiply

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#60:1:A>
Most systems allow several file servers to be linked together into
one large mail system

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#61:1:A>
This complicates addressing

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#62:1:A>
Multiple servers require more precise naming schemes than the
two-part scheme many system used earlier on a <?> onto </?> route the mail

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#63:1:A>
In that the address contained a user  ' s name and the name of the
post office or server

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#64:1:A>
Most of the systems we reviewed use a three-part scheme that allows
a single local network to have several post offices

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#65:1:A>
In this instances directory <,> propagation <,> where new users are
automatically added to attach the post offices is a desirable feature

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#66:1:A>
But the complexities grow

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#67:1:A>
In many corporations today different work groups choose their own
e-mail products without regard to what other groups are using

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#68:1:A>
This poses no problem until the different groups need to
communicate

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#69:1:A>
The problem is reminiscent of those days when various department
<.> ch </.> chose different word processors and then found that they could
not read the incompatible formats when they wanted to share documents

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#70:1:A>
In the case of e-mail the standard solution is that dedicated
translator call a gateway

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#71:1:A>
Most gateways are system-specific

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#72:1:A>
That is they link to specific e-mail systems such as ccMail and
WordPerfect Office

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#73:1:A>
When more than two or three systems are being connected setting up
the links can become an administrator  ' s nightmare

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#74:1:A>
MHS can ease communications difference difficulties among
incompatible e- mail systems because it serve as a common intermediary
language

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#75:1:A>
Developed by Action Technology and subsequently bought and marketed
by Novell MHS is the oldest and most widely use e-mail standard we have

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#76:1:A>
Any e-mail product that can talk to MHS either at its own transport
system or through the MHS gateway can link to any other such system

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#77:1:A>
But there are competing standards

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#78:1:A>
Microsoft has implemented its Messaging Application Programming
Interface MAPI in Microsoft Mail and its Schedule plus scheduler

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#79:1:A>
And last year Lotus announced its Open Messaging Interface which
this year evolved into the Vendor Independent Messaging standard

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#80:1:A>
Lotus is jointly developing VIM with Apple Computer Borland Borland
International and Novell

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#81:1:A>
See the sidebar Mail-Enabled Applications Help Groups Work Together

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#82:1:A>
The desktop perspective

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#83:1:A>
The transport mechanism is at the back-end mail system

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#84:1:A>
Each package <?> which </?> we reviewed has at least four front
ends a DOS version a TSR version to <?> pull </?> into the background and
notify users of incoming messages a Window version with a graphical interface
and a remote dial-in version

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#85:1:A>
Ideally this version should all offer the same functionality

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#86:1:A>
But that is not always the case

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#87:1:A>
Da Vinci  ' s DOS version for example was one release ahead of its
Window version at Window version at the time of our review

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#88:1:A>
It had more features

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#89:1:A>
A situation Da Vinci <.> pl </.> plans to correct

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#90:1:A>
All of the <.> pack </.> packages reviewed here are on a equal
footing when it becomes to basic addressing tasks

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#91:1:A>
In each you  ' ll find pick lists from which user can select
addresses

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#92:1:A>
All have speed search capability <,> that will <.> ma </.> match a
name in the database to the first <?> few </?> letters the user types

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#93:1:A>
But the similarity ends there

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#94:1:A>
Some like ccMail allow both user and administrators to create
personal address list

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#95:1:A>
Other allow only administrators to do this

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#96:1:A>
Microsoft Mail offers send folders to log the messages you send

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#97:1:A>
But few others do

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#98:1:A>
Without a send folder you have to remember to copy yourself on
every message or else you miss half the point of e-mail keeping track of what
you you have send to others

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#99:1:A>
Creating messages

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#100:1:A>
Creating e-mail messages should be easy as writing letters in your
favorite word processor

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#101:1:A>
Cut and paste search and replace tabs fonts rulers and all the
others standbys of modern text processing ought to be available

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#102:1:A>
And you ought to be able to use your own word processor to compose
an e-mail message

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#103:1:A>
But except for WordPerfect Office which is closely tied to
WordPerfect itself

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#104:1:A>
None of the packages have this option yet

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#105:1:A>
The new DOS version of ccMail and Da Vinci eMail however do
include conveniences such as spell-checks spell-checkers

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#106:1:A>
For now if you want to send a graphic or an <,> executable file
you are forced to attach binary files

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#107:1:A>
A well-designed e-mail package should facilitate this with point
and shot attachment point and shoot attachment procedures that allow for
multiple attachments

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#108:1:A>
Futurus Team allows sixty-four attachments per message

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#109:1:A>
The cc Mail and Microsoft Mail front ends for Windows workstations
call the Window client <?> Window  ' s </?> clients do it one better which
drag-and-drop attachment

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#110:1:A>
All a user needs to do is click on a filename and drag it into
their message

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#111:1:A>
But attachment should become less of an issue in the future as
more and more applications allow you to send rich compound compound documents
that incorporate graphics sound and video

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#112:1:A>
Information overflow

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#113:1:A>
As the number of messages increases storage space on the server
diminishes and information becomes hard to find in the clutters in the
clutter

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#114:1:A>
If end users fail to archives archive or delete their messages the
task falls to the administrator

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#115:1:A>
An organized <?> system-wide </?> approach to storing and
archiving <,> solves both problems

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#116:1:A>
An e-mail package should allow user to store active message thread
in folders and archive older inactive messages on the local machines

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#117:1:A>
Most of the reviewed packages let user create personal storage
folders

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#118:1:A>
Some allow users to <.> ne </.> nest folders as subtopics for more
detailed message organization

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#119:1:A>
Da Vinci eMail for example allow up to thirty-two subfolders
within a primary folder

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#120:1:A>
But archiving information is only useful if it is easy to retrieve

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#121:1:A>
And unfortunately finding needed information remain difficult at
best

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#122:1:A>
The programs we review let users search the To From Subject Date
and Priority fields

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#123:1:A>
But it is tough to get at keyboard in the content of the message

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#124:1:A>
Microsoft Mail  ' s message finder <,> allows you to search text and
provides the luxury of letting you conduct a global search

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#125:1:A>
ccMail includes a search feature but you can only search one
folder at a time

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#126:1:A>
Grouping toward groupware

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#127:1:A>
Today  ' s e-mail packages need considerable refinement before they  ' ll
become all that they can be

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#128:1:A>
But they provide a promising foundation for that shadowy
futuristic concept call groupware

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#129:1:A>
Groupware is evolving in the form of networked workgroup
scheduling document management and shared databases

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#130:1:A>
Usually accompanied by a programming languages language or system
or rules for managing and automating the way the components work together

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#131:1:A>
E-mail system are already beginning to take on a groupware look

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#132:1:A>
Microsoft Mail for example is bundled with Microsoft  ' s Schedule
plus a group schedule <.> sche </.> a group scheduling module that is fully
integrated with the Windows e-mail client

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#133:1:A>
ccMail Da Vinci eMail and Futurus Team have their own schedulers
developed by third parties

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#134:1:A>
WordPerfect Office four dot zero goes one step further and
includes scheduling as an integral part of the package

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#135:1:A>
Office <,> Office pursue workgroup computing by allowing users to
launch WordPerfect applications and other selected applications including
Microsoft Excel from within the mail program

<ICE-HK:S2B-043#136:1:A>
To do this it uses a <.> ma </.> macro language with DDE Dynamic
Data Exchange linked to the applications </I>
