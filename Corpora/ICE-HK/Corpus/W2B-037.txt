Specifications </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#5:1>
<bold> Price: </bold> HK&dollar;2,490 </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#6:1>
<bold> Pros: </bold> Wacky styling , sharp sound , plays MP3 files
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#7:1>
<bold> Cons: </bold> Poor bass , no optical output </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#8:1>
Thanks largely to the popularity of online file sharing , the
ubiquitous MP3 digital music format is finding its way into many devices -
from mobile hones to the home stereo system . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#9:1>
The most striking feature of Philip  ' s new line of Emotive Micro
Audio Systems is they are packaged in three different , rubbished styles with
distinctive names: Matt &obrack;  red &cbrack; , Blast &obrack;  silver &cbrack; and Gloss &obrack;  green &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#10:1>
The promotional material suggests the system is composed of three
controlled units , but there is a fourth , slightly smaller box containing
the power adaptor . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#11:1>
Set-up is simple and the speaker wires are jack plug-type rather
than bare-wire connections , the 50-watt &obrack;  RMS &cbrack; amplifier , two-way bass
reflex speaker system and three-inch full-range woofers offer above-average
sound quality . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#12:1>
As far as performance goes , the system did justice to jazz tunes
, with high-pitched notes sounding fairly sharp and crisp , but our techno
discs were a bit of a letdown , mainly because the bass notes were only
reasonably - and far from impressively - resonant . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#13:1>
Other features , such as a Minidisk &obrack;  MD &cbrack; player and optical
output jack &obrack;  to record to a separate MD recorder &cbrack; , are conspicuously absent .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#14:1>
The system does support MP3-CDs and the memory can be programmed
to play back to 99 tracks from a CD .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#15:1>
The remote control is as slim as to credit cards , so it will not add
significantly to the pile on the coffee table . </p>

<bold> Region is awash in pirated software: survey </bold> </h> <h>

<bold> BENJAMIN WONG </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#19:2>
More than half the software installed on Hong Kong computers is
pirated and on the mainland the rate is 92 per cent , according to a global
survey released yesterday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#20:2>
Slashing the level of pirated software would boost both economies
by enabling the information technology sector to expand , and in turn benefit
other sectors , bringing with it a tax revenue windfall for both governments
, it was claimed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#21:2>
A 10 per cent cut would generate US&dollar;630 million &obrack; 
HK&dollar;4.91 billion &cbrack; for the Hong Kong economy and bring in US&dollar;40
million in tax income , it was estimated .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#22:2>
On the mainland , reducing the level of piracy by the same amount
could boost the economy by as much as US&dollar;122 billion and provide an
extra US&dollar;10 billion for the government in revenue , the survey claimed .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#23:2>
The survey was conducted by research firm International Data ,
which denied the figures showing potential benefits of cutting piracy levels
were too optimistic .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#24:2>
Research manager Robin Giang added that complex methodology had been
used , with many variables including the tax rate and the number of people
employed in the IT sector . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#25:2>
The study was conducted in 57 countries , including 14 in the
Asia-Pacific region .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#26:2>
Based on the data from 2001 , the last year covered by the survey ,
Vietnam has the worst piracy rate at 94 per cent . China ranked second ,
followed by Indonesia at 88 per cent . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#27:2>
Hong Kong is joint 24th on the table at 53 per cent , on a par
with Taiwan and Poland.

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#28:2>
Ringo Wong Chee-kao , chairman of the Hong Kong Business Software
Alliance &obrack;  BSA &cbrack; , which commissioned the survey , said a high piracy rate
would turn investors away . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#29:2>
&ldquo; Only a low piracy rate encourages entrepreneurs to invest
in developing innovative products and services , &rdquo; he said .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#30:2>
&ldquo; The key challenge moving forward will be ensuring effective
criminal enforcement against the illegal use of software in the business
environment . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#31:2>
The BSA argued that , in time , a 10 per cent cut in the piracy
rate could be achieved .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#32:2>
It said Hong Kong achieved an 11 per cent cut between 1996 and 2001 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#33:2>
Mr Wong dismissed claims that people only turned to pirated copies
because authentic software was too expensive .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#34:2>
He said nearly all kinds of software were illegally copied ,
regardless of the price . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#35:2>
&ldquo; There is no correlation .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#36:2>
We don't see more expensive software being pirated more , &rdquo; he
said .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#37:2>
&ldquo; There is no way software developers can compete in price with
the software that the pirates sell , which is virtually free . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#38:2>
Director of the government  ' s Intellectual Property Department ,
Stephen Selby , said customs officers were ready to carry out raids .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#39:2>
He also said the government was talking to software developers about
simplifying the process used to prove their software had been pirated . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#40:2>
The fastest growing means of trading pirated material is through
the Internet , according to the BSA  ' s vice-president , Jeffrey Hardee .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#41:2>
&ldquo; We used search engines to look for sites offering pirated
copies , and it  ' s incredible how many we came up with , &rdquo; he said .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#42:2>
" We  ' ve notified Internet service providers , advising that they
shut them down or they will be liable too . &rdquo; </p>

<h> <bold> City Telecom may enter mobile market in 2006; Low-cost
operator hopes government will open up sector with new licences </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#44:3>

<p> Hong Kong  ' s most aggressive discounter of long-distance call services
may enter the local mobile market in 2006 should the government stick to a
plan to open the sector further . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#45:3>

<p> City Telecom &obrack;  CTI &cbrack; would consider a market entry should the government
proceed with plans to sell more mobile-phone radio spectrum in three years'
time , according to its chairman , Ricky Wong Wai-kay . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#46:3>

<p> Long tipped to fade due to intensifying competition , CTI has defied
critics by maintaining customers , loyal to its low long-distance rates ,
and has branched into local telephone services with plans to launch a local
pay-television service later this year. </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#47:3>

<p> Although a minnow next to the leading players , it is one of the most
profitable operators , turning an interim profit of HK&dollar;112.86 million .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#48:3>

<p> Having a network that covered most of Hong Kong , it would be natural for
the firm to look at mobile , Mr Wong said , although he added that any
decision depended on the cost of market entry . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#49:3>

<p> Despite a crowded market of six , new operators are lining up as possible
entrants .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#50:3>
PCCW , which sold CSL in June last year , said it might return next
year . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#51:3>

<p> While the firm , controlled by Richard Li Tzar-kai , would be expected to
focus on mobile data traffic , Mr Wong said he would avoid third-generation &obrack; 
3G &cbrack; services . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#52:3>

<p> &ldquo; I don't believe in 3G , &rdquo; Mr Wong said , adding that he had
no interest in becoming a virtual operator on the back of another firm  ' s
network . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#53:3>

<p> He said CTI had more than 800,000 active users for its IDD , fixed-line
or broadband services , a crucial advantage in entering the mobile sector .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#54:3>

<p> In addition , it had a cost advantage to other mobile operators who did
not have an affiliated fixed-line network .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#55:3>
Mr Wong said one of the major expenses for a mobile operator was to
pay the fixed-line connection with its cell sites , costing up to
HK&dollar;10,000 per line per month . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#56:3>

<p> What is not clear is how the Office of the Telecommunications Authority
will distribute new licences for mobile telephony .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#57:3>
After auctioning four 3G licences in 2001 , the telecoms regulator
has not decided whether to proceed with a similar system for its next round
of so-called 2G voice licences. </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#58:3>

<p> &ldquo; If it is auctioned , I would bid , &rdquo; Mr Wong said . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#59:3>


<p> CTI plans to launch its pay-TV service this summer with an initial 10 to
20 channels .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#60:3>
According to Mr Wong , CTI would provide a cheaper but different
service to monopoly i-Cable Communications . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#61:3>

<p> &ldquo; Cable TV penetration is only 30 per cent in Hong Kong , and we
would position to target the remaining 70 per cent of the market , &rdquo; Mr
Wong said .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#62:3>
He expected the local cable TV market to grow as new players entered
and cited India as a target , which he said had 50 per cent household
penetration . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#65:4>
An aggressive price war between mobile operators would do little
to hurt Sunday Communication  ' s quest for its first profitability this year ,
according to group managing director Bruce Hicks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#66:4>
&ldquo; I wish we were not in a price war , but that is the
situation . I remain confident in making our previous forecasts this year ,
&rdquo; Mr Hicks said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#67:4>
&ldquo; There is nothing clever about price competition .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#68:4>
Nobody wins in the price war . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#69:4>
Sunday last week announced a HK&dollar;88 for 500 minutes monthly
tariff plan - 10 per cent higher than the plans offered by four of its rival
operators . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#70:4>
Stable tariffs last year helped three of the six operators return
to profits . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#71:4>
Sunday , one of the two loss-making operators , trimmed its loss
by 45 per cent to HK&dollar;117 million .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#72:4>
No 1 mobile operator Hutchison Telecom also failed to make a profit
last year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#73:4>
Operators are now using aggressive pricing strategies , some
equivalent to HK&dollar;10 for an hour  ' s usage , to attract subscribers to
their network in a market which has more than 85 per cent penetration . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#74:4>
Merrill Lynch has already downgraded SmarTone  ' s earnings by 10
per cent to HK&dollar;357 million in the wake of the price war . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#75:4>
Mr Hicks said last month that Sunday had made a profit in the
first quarter , and promised the company would become profitable for the year .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#76:4>
He said the price war would not affect Sunday  ' s profitability as
cost cutting measures would come into effect this year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#77:4>
These measures included cutting its workforce by 20 per cent , as
well as letting go of three of its highest paid executives last year .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#78:4>
The remaining staff also suffered a pay cut , Mr Hicks said . </p>

<bold> HUI YUK-MIN </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#81:5>
The renewed price war among Hong Kong mobile phone operators has
sparked a surge in subscribers switching networks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#82:5>
Office of Telecommunications Authority statistics show 115,727
mobile users switched carriers last month , up 61.7 per cent from 71,578 in
February . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#83:5>
It was also the highest churn rate since March last year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#84:5>
According to ABN Amro , the number of users switching networks
implied a monthly churn rate of 1.8 per cent , against 1.1 per cent
previously . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#85:5>
ABN Amro analyst Mayur Nallamala said the jump came as operators
launched cheaper tariff plans and waived a HK&dollar;140 fee on customers
switching networks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#86:5>
Analysts said the high churn rate could continue in the following
months as the price war heated up . </p> Mobile-phone operators renewed their
price war in late-February after No 3 carrier SmarTone Telecommunications
Holdings began offering its PayGo service charging HK&dollar;50 for 200
minutes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#87:5>
The price war accelerated two weeks ago when SmarTone unveiled an
HK&dollar;80 price plan offering 500 minutes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#88:5>
However , a SmarTone spokeswoman yesterday denied it had started a
fresh round of price cuts . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#89:5>
&ldquo; We didn't start a price war . Price competition has never
stopped , it  ' s just in a different form .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#90:5>
Operators have been offering different sorts of promotions to attract
customers . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#91:5>
SmarTone  ' s low-tariff packages were quickly matched by its
rivals , with the exception of CSL , which offered handset subsidies in lieu
of a price cut . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#92:5>
&ldquo; In the end it is the same , &rdquo; said BNP Paribas
Peregrine regional telecommunications research director Voon San Lai , who
said all operators ' earnings would be hurt by the fresh round of price cuts .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#93:5>
&ldquo; There is going to be a higher churn rate , that  ' s
primarily because the operators have started to look at price cuts . &rdquo;
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#94:5>
Mr Lai expects the price war to gather momentum later this year
when Hutchison Telecom starts to roll out third-generation mobile services to
poach subscribers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#95:5>
The churn rate fell last summer after a two-year price war among
operators died down , helping all except Sunday Communications make a profit .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#96:5>
In 2000 and 2001 , CSL , now owned by Telstra Corp , was the only
profitable carrier . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#97:5>
Mr Lai said if the price war was prolonged , operators would head
back to the cut-throat situation of two years ago , which could put some
back into the red . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#98:5>
BNP Paribas recently cut its 2003 earnings forecasts for SmarTone
by 8 per cent as it expects the carrier  ' s average revenue per user to fall
to HK&dollar;190 from its previous estimate of HK&dollar;205 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#99:5>
It blamed the price war and a fall in roaming revenue on users
cutting back on travel due to the atypical pneumonia . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-037#100:5>
&ldquo; My impression is everyone will be a loser . In our
opinion , this higher churn is a battle for everybody , and if it continues ,
it is likely to lead to a repeat of 2000 when everyone was losing money ,
&rdquo; Mr Lai said .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#101:5>
&ldquo; At the end of the day , no one is going to win except the
consumers . &rdquo; </p>

<h> <bold> A hi-tech base in the High Court </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#103:6>

<p> There will be no long pauses and shuffling of paper in Hong Kong  ' s
newest courtroom .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#104:6>
The &dollar;9 million &ldquo; technology court &rdquo; has been
designed to optimise gadgetry and minimise paperwork in the judicial process .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#105:6>

<p> From outside , the hi-tech court - housed in the High Court building -
looks the same as other courts , except for a flat-screen television next to
its entrance . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#106:6>

<p> Inside are hi-tech gadgets such as plasma televisions , overhead
projector screens , computers for lawyers , judges and court reporters ,
closed-circuit televisions and a video conferencing system . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#107:6>

<p> Lawyers will no longer need to pass paper documents to the judge as the
document can be viewed on projector screens . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#108:6>

<p> When questioning witnesses , lawyers can ask them to pinpoint areas on a
diagram on the computer monitor using a pen .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#109:6>
Lawyers can also recreate the crime scene using computer animation .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#110:6>
&ldquo; In cases where there are mountains and mountains of
documents , you can simply scan them into a few disks , &rdquo; said Chief
Justice Andrew Li Kwok-nang .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#111:6>
&ldquo; This will make the trial much more efficient and costs
could be saved." </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#112:6>

<p> It will be used for the first time in a civil case this week when lawyers
will use video-conferencing to interview witnesses from Korea and Belgium .

<ICE-HK:W2B-037#113:6>
Planning for the court began three years ago and the &dollar;9
million budget was granted the following year . </p>
