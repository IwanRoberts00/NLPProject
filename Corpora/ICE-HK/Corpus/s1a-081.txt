that uh she allocated to is band five

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#216:1:B>
A band <{5> <[5> four or </[5> band five school

Uhm they always fight in the <{7> <[7> <,> in the </[7> classroom

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#219:1:B>

Uhm uhm no teacher uh but band four or band five <{> <[> <,>
</[> teacher

</&> in those school actually have some kind of background <{1> <[1> uh </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#242:1:B>
Really uh <,> then they <,> uh if they without <,> uh those uh
maybe triad background

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#243:1:B>
They can't communicate with the student and the student won't uhm
afraid of them

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#244:1:B>
<{2> <[2> And </[2> <,> so she think that it  ' s too <.> com </.>
complicated for her

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X245:1:Z>
<[1> Really </[1> </{1>

Uhm do you do you regard yourself as uhm a foreigner or Hong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X290:1:Z>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-081#291:1:B>
<[> You </[> </{> you regard yourself as a <{> <[> foreigner
</[>

<$Z> <X>

<[> Yeah </[> </{> yeah </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-081#293:1:B>
But you have <,> been lived in Hong Kong so many years

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#294:1:B>
So maybe some foreigner will think that oh I  ' m Hong Kong people
maybe

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X295:1:Z>
Oh it was it  ' s interesting when I was in secondary school

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X296:1:Z>
Because I was in a a local school

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X297:1:Z>
<{1> <[1> All </[1> my friends are Chinese and yeah and I keep on
talking to them in Chinese

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X298:1:Z>
So uhm <,> at that time I regarded myself a little bit like a <,>
a Chinese or <,> a common Hong Kong person

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X299:1:Z>
But uh since I have been in Hong Kong U uh things have changed

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X300:1:Z>
I don't know why

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X301:1:Z>
Uhm maybe because I have been going to some other countries to
stay there for <,> uh during the summer vacation <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X302:1:Z>
Uh ha and or maybe because I  ' m studying something that I like
more

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X303:1:Z>
And I <,> I got more contact with the English culture

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X304:1:Z>
Yeah so I I think I  ' ve started regard myself more as a foreigner
<{3> <[3> yeah </[3> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-081#305:1:B>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

Switzerland </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-081#321:1:B>
Switzerland

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X322:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-081#323:1:A>
<{> <[> Yes </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X326:1:Z>
And the people over there they are just nice

<{1> <[1> Alright </[1> looking around uh ha

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X331:1:Z>
And uh an old man saw us looking around

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X332:1:Z>
And he came and approach us and he ask uh are you looking for the
youth hostel

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X333:1:Z>
You know we don't ask any question

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X334:1:Z>
We just looking around <{2> <[2> and he </[2> came to ask you and
he show us the way

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X335:1:Z>
<{3> <[3> Yeah </[3> it was impressive and uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X336:1:Z>
In Switzerland yeah uh people uh in the bus

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X337:1:Z>
They would uh tell you uh you  ' ve got two more stations to get
off

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X338:1:Z>
Yeah <{4> <[4> or </[4> they would ask ask you are you a
foreigner are you tourist things like that

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X339:1:Z>
They are very nice and keep on talking to you and uh promoting
their country to you <&>

<$A> and

<$B> laugh </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X340:1:B>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-081#341:1:B>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#342:1:B>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#344:1:B>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#345:1:B>
I think in Hong Kong people uhm not <,> are are not as friendly as
Switzerland

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#346:1:B>
Not because their nature but because they are very busy <{1> <[1>
actually </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#347:1:B>
Maybe uhm some people want to help you

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#348:1:B>
But when they uhm see the watch

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#349:1:B>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X353:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X354:1:Z>
Yeah I agree with you

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X355:1:Z>
And maybe uhm <,> I think uh people in Hong Kong are being
trained to protect themselves quite <{1> <[1> a lot </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X356:1:Z>
Yeah yeah yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X357:1:Z>
Uh don't talk to strangers

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X358:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X366:1:Z>
Yeah yeah yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-081#367:1:A>
Because uh I think it  ' s because of the traditional Chinese
value is rather protective

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X368:1:Z>
Yeah yeah yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X369:1:Z>
And the government is teaching people not to uh give money to the

<{> <[> So yeah </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X371:1:Z>

Yeah the Hong Kong one uh <&> tut </&> a bit too common you know
<{> <[> yeah the </[> yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X489:1:Z>
It seems that they are producing movies just for the sake of
producing them

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X490:1:Z>
Yeah not uh <,> yeah </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-081#491:1:B>

Uhm I like to watch Western movie also

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#494:1:B>
Because I think Hong Kong uh after I  ' ve watched the Hong Kong
movie

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#495:1:B>
Uh I would think that I  ' m so stupid <unc> one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#496:1:B>
I have <?> waste </?> so many money <{1> <[1> to </[1> <{2> <[2>
<,> </[2> to buy a ticket <{3> <[3> for that </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#497:1:B>
So <{4> <[4> <,> it  ' s not good </[4>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X498:1:Z>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-081#499:1:A>

<[3> Yeah yeah </[3> </{3> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-081#501:1:A>

movies are also very good

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X502:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-081#503:1:A>

movies some some of them are <?> it </?> are very difficult to

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#504:1:A>
You you  ' re <,> you <.> fi </.> find very difficult to catch their
meaning <&> All speakers laugh </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#505:1:A>
Just like the film of <indig> wohng ga waih </indig> <&>
Cantonese=a-Hong-Kong-film-director </&> <{1> <[1> I always </[1> <unc>
one-word </unc> understand what he  ' s <,> talking about

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#506:1:A>
What what message is he communicating with the audience

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#507:1:A>
<{2> <[2> I don't </[2> understand his movies

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X508:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#511:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-081#512:1:A>

But whereas we can't understand <&>

<$B> laughs </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X520:1:B>

</unc>

<{1> <[1> I think </[1> you better change your <{2> <[2> <,>
</[2> appearance

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X559:1:Z>
Because <{3> <[3> it determines </[3> a lot

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X560:1:Z>
<{4> <[4> When I </[4> was having the interview uh of the
Education Department

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X561:1:Z>
Uh my classmate said that I <,> that day I look <.> ex </.>
extremely smart

So uh <{1> <[1> I  ' m I  ' m </[1> looking for auditing firm jobs and
accounting firm jobs

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#591:1:Z>
But because my degree is not in accounting

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#592:1:Z>
<{2> <[2> That  ' s cause </[2> much difficulty <{3> <[3> for me

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#593:1:Z>
So I have to <?> started </?> I have to start over

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#594:1:Z>
And <,> the Career Centre said oh you better send some letter to
the accounting firm <{4> <[4> to see </[4> whether they need <,> any people

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#595:1:Z>
They need any new candidates <{5> <[5> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#602:1:B>
<[5> Uh ha uh ha </[5> </{5>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X603:1:Z>
Great </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-081#604:1:B>
Uh ha

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X605:1:Z>
Uhm last year my boyfriend uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X606:1:Z>
He send letters to any firms that are <{1> <[1> available </[1>
actually <{2> <[2> yeah </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X607:1:Z>
Yeah and and according to him <,> uh he doesn't trust the Career
Centre too much now

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X608:1:Z>
Because uhm his friend and him didn't get jobs through the Career
<{3> <[3> Centre </[3> yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X609:1:Z>
And well it  ' s only for <,> the best students

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X610:1:Z>
<{4> <[4> Career Centre yes </[4> and <{5> <[5> best students
</[5> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-081#611:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#612:1:A>
<[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#613:1:A>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#614:1:A>
<[4> Yeah </[4>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-081#615:1:B>
<[4> Yeah </[4> </{4>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-081#616:1:A>
<[5> And <,> and </[5> </{5> most of them hold several offers

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#617:1:A>
Five <{> <[> offers or </[> six offers

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#618:1:A>
So many students many <?> fairest </?> students cannot get the job
offers

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X619:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X620:1:Z>
Yeah yeah yeah </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-081#621:1:B>
And I think I won't uhm find my job through the Career Centre

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#622:1:B>
Because I think I I totally agree with you that uhm only the top
student can get the offer <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#623:1:B>
And uhm <,> I have uh attend to the career talk

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#624:1:B>
Uhm I  ' ve I I think in the first semester

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#625:1:B>
It  ' s uh management trainee of <,> uh I I can't remember what bank

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#626:1:B>
And all of my classmate uh send application letter <,> to <{2>
<[2> the </[2> bank

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#627:1:B>
But uhm actually uh we haven't got the chance of the first
interview <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#628:1:B>
Because maybe because uh I  ' m a BA student

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#629:1:B>
Do you know <{4> <[4> uh Arts </[4> student

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#630:1:B>
And <,> we we know that all the <,> uh candidate shortlisted by
the bank is uh from BBA or something like <.> Ec Econ </.> or Financial

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#631:1:B>
It  ' s not <,> it  ' s not uh for us actually

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#632:1:B>
<{5> <[5> So </[5> <&> tut </&> it  ' s uhm I think they are lying

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#633:1:B>
Because they said it is <,> uh the post is for <{6> <[6> all
discipline </[6> <{7> <[7> <,> </[7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#634:1:B>
So it  ' s it  ' s quite

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#635:1:B>
I think it  ' s quite difficult for the Art student to get uh to
find a job <{8> <[8> related </[8> to the business <{9> <[9> <,> </[9>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#636:1:B>
Uhm actually secondary school my uh my teacher

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#637:1:B>
Uh when when they told us how to choose your uh future subject in
university

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#638:1:B>
Don't think of your future career as it it is and not it is

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#639:1:B>
There is no relationship <{10> <[10> between </[10> them

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#640:1:B>
Uh just uh choose what you you are interested in

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#641:1:B>
But I think it  ' s a lie too

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X642:1:Z>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-081#643:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<[4> Yeah </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X647:1:Z>
<[5> Oh </[5> </{5> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-081#648:1:A>
<[6> All discipline </[6> </{6>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#X649:1:Z>
<[7> Yeah </[7> </{7> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-081#650:1:A>
<[8> Uhm </[8> </{8>

<ICE-HK:S1A-081#651:1:A>
