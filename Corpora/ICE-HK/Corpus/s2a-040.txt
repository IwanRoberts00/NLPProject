<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-040#1:1:A>
They have not changed much

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#2:1:A>
There are some new items <,> but basically they are <,,> academic
excellence <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#3:1:A>
Before that <,> I am not sure why it does not show up on the screen
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#4:1:A>
But in my own notes the first item is the employer  ' s perception of
the university

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#5:1:A>
It is very surprising <,> <unc> several words </unc> when I
ran around these <?> for </?> employers <,> and ask them <,> whom do you
recruit from

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#6:1:A>
Some of them the last one whom I visited said <,> we only recruit
from six universities <,> around the world

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#7:1:A>
We only look at six

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#8:1:A>
Some tell us they only look at two

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#9:1:A>
Which for some employers <,> their perception of the university is
very important

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#10:1:A>
And their perception is not always correct <,> but certainly their
perception of the university

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#11:1:A>
The second criterion which they <,> <.> s </.> shortlist candidates
<,> is academic excellence

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#12:1:A>
What does that include <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#13:1:A>
Now <,> and then excellence for some employers includes this <,>
your examination results <,> in English <,> Chinese <,> and Mathematics

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#14:1:A>
And the Hong Kong school <,> and the Hong Kong Certificate of
Education <,> Exam <,> and the Hong Kong <,> A-Level Exam

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#15:1:A>
The public examination result at HKCE and HKAL

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#16:1:A>
The next one is GPA at the University

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#17:1:A>
The surprising thing is GPA <,> is not as important to them <,> as
examination <?> as </?> public examinations

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#18:1:A>
Because the GPA <,> it is offered by individual university <,> and
it  ' s not there  ' s no objective benchmark <,> object

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#19:1:A>
Whereas your school certificate <,> and A-Level <,> or equivalent
public exams there is an <.> ob </.> objective benchmark <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#20:1:A>
And the next thing to look at is well-rounded achievement

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#21:1:A>
This means <,,> uh this the applicants  '  achievement in the
students  '  societies <,> in community service and their hobbies

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#22:1:A>
<?> But </?> not just studying alone

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#23:1:A>
The third criterion we look at <,> is clear career goal

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#24:1:A>
Do you know what you want to do with your life

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#25:1:A>
Do you know what you want to be in five years time or ten years
time

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#26:1:A>
How much do you know about the industry <,> the occupation and the
organization

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#27:1:A>
You do not have to be an expert <,> but you have to be as
knowledgeable as an informed and interested layman

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#28:1:A>
<.> A </.> And you have to know about <,> the market <,> you have
the market knowledge and not the sense

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#29:1:A>
The next one to look at is your <?> key </?> it  ' s the applicants  ' 
<?> key </?> skills of core competency <?> the transferable skills </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#30:1:A>
These include communicate

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#31:1:A>
Communication is different from language skills

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#32:1:A>
You might speak perfect English <,> perfect Putonghua perfect
Cantonese

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#33:1:A>
<?> But </?> then high level of vocabulary <,> and yet you are not
communicative

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#34:1:A>
So that is a distinction <,> between them

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#35:1:A>
The next one is problem-solving <,> working with others <,> and
improving old learning and performance

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#36:1:A>
This is very important

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#37:1:A>
If your record shows that you are a person who  ' s very
conscientious who had a lot of achievements <,> because <,> you do what you
were told

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#38:1:A>
You are very obedient <,> very hard-working <,> do as you are told

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#39:1:A>
That is not good enough

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#40:1:A>
You have to be a self-starter who had who <,> who has who who has a
structure and a process <,> to know how to keep on improving your old
learning and performance <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#41:1:A>
And the next log of things to look at is personal attributes

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#42:1:A>
These include whether you are <,> interesting <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#43:1:A>
Just being hard-working and have good examination result is not
good enough

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#44:1:A>
You have to be interesting

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#45:1:A>
You have to be creative

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#46:1:A>
Doesn't necessarily mean that you have to wear <,> out uh very
fashionable trendy things and wear ear- rings <unc> several words
</unc> but you have to be able to <,> create a solution to problems <,>
create a new approach to doing things

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#47:1:A>
And you have to be modest <,> that  ' s why I refer to the first
slide big- headed graduate screws up from top jobs <,> cause the the the
speaker the interviewee was saying <,> so difficult to find that local
talents who beat our standard <,> and even if you find them <,> they  ' re so
big-headed

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#48:1:A>
All right so modesty <,> willingness to learn <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#49:1:A>
Someone who knows their own limitations

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#50:1:A>
Somebody who  ' s critical <,> but <,> constructive

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#51:1:A>
Somebody who  ' s hard-working <,> and increasingly in recent years
<,> global perspective

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#52:1:A>
What is happening <unc> several words </unc> <,> what  ' s
happening as <unc> one word </unc> what do you think

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#53:1:A>
How do you compare what is happening to us as <unc> one word
</unc> as to the uh crack down on uh on uh corruption in the mainland

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#54:1:A>
What do you think of the Middle East problem

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#55:1:A>
Do you think the Pakistanis uh will be uh Pakistanians will get in
a uh <,> <unc> one word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#56:1:A>
So you you are expected to have a global perspective <,> and to be
sociable and outgoing <,> and I  ' ve been told by an employer that he knows of
staff in his firm <,> who are brilliant and hard-working <unc> several
words </unc> <,> but will never be promoted beyond the position <,>
because they are not outgoing enough <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#57:1:A>
So <,> lastly <,> you you have to look the path as well <,> do you
have to have <,> <unc> two words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#58:1:A>
Appropriate presence

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#59:1:A>
In my job <,> uhm would you help students prepare for interviews
and the employers a bit hesitated about <,> what we do <,> and I argue then
<,> is that <,> I am not trying to give them model answers to repeat because
that will not do and that is being moral

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#60:1:A>
What we do is to told them truth make them think it through whether
or not they are suitable for the job and why do they think they can do it
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#61:1:A>
And in doing so <,> we need to <?> this to a interesting </?> her
different aspirations

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#62:1:A>
And when I come to preparing students for the administrative office
service system <,> in the Hong Kong government <,> which is one of the most
<,> it  ' s now no longer the highest paid job <,> it  ' s used to be the most
<,> the highest paid job in in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#63:1:A>
And I often <,> I can often tell whether a person has that <,>
presence

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#64:1:A>
Alright so we are <unc> several words </unc> <,> or
presence

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#65:1:A>
I will review my age when I  ' m saying the next thing <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#66:1:A>
Fanny Law <,> is <,> one of our graduates <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#67:1:A>
And she came to see me when she <unc> several words </unc>
in the AO <,> and she certainly had good presence

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#68:1:A>
And so this is <unc> one word </unc> <,> and the presence
<,> appropriate presence <unc> several words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#69:1:A>
Okay so this is what <,> employers want <,> so what I want to
<unc> one word </unc> bring out bring them out

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#70:1:A>
Because they are now talking about local graduates how the local
graduates maintain the competitive edge <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#71:1:A>
So I assume <,> those of you who are interested in this topic are
probably thinking of <,> should I go overseas <,> to do my university degree
<,> or should I stay in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#72:1:A>
People have been saying that the standard of local graduates have
deteriorated so much

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#73:1:A>
Should I still waste my time <,> to study in Hong Kong <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#74:1:A>
And my answer is <,> is certainly <,> are not wasting time <,>
alright

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#75:1:A>
And then <,> besides giving you some evidence <,> I want to show
<,> you <,> if you  ' re interested <,> in <,> in investing in your degree <,>
for the sake of employment then <,> besides <,> think of our <,> which
country to go for <?> universal </?> study

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#76:1:A>
Or <,> which institution <,> if you you will do yourself <,> better
<,> a better service <,> by knowing that <,> no university is perfect

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#77:1:A>
None <,> of the universities are perfect

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#78:1:A>
Know what employers want <,> see what a university can deliver that
and make up the gap <,> yourself <,> so doesn't matter where you go to
university <,> alright

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#79:1:A>
Alright so <,> I go to <unc> several-words </unc> <,> how
<,> uh how uhm <,> I apologize for the for <,> uhm <,> the wordings of this
fly which is not quite correct and <,> our colleague here from the English
Department <,> is recording my presentation

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#80:1:A>
<unc> several-words </unc> they would tell me where I did
wrong and how I should improve my <,> English so <,> I look forward to
hearing from them and how this should be <unc> 1 WORD </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#81:1:A>
Anyway <,> what I want to say is <,> what should we aim at
achieving <,> at the university <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#82:1:A>
We should use it <,> for an <,> to become <,> educated <,> to be
prepared for life

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#83:1:A>
These two are more important <,> than <,> this one

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#84:1:A>
Do not think of using your university degree just for the world of
work

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#85:1:A>
And don't just take a degree <,> that is hot <.> o </.> in a job
market

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#86:1:A>
That is the worst thing you can do for yourself

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#87:1:A>
I shall explain later on

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#88:1:A>
And we believe very much <,> in our motif <foreign> sapientia et
virtus </foreign> <indig> mihng dak gaak maht </indig>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#89:1:A>
To understand virtues be a moral person <,> and you use your moral
principle to understand matters

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#90:1:A>
And of course <,> <indig> dak ji tai kwahn meih </indig>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#91:1:A>
This is what particularly <unc> one word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#92:1:A>
Now why do I say <,> preparing for the world of work is less
important than the first two <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#93:1:A>
Firstly <,> for <,> the principle <,> because it <unc> ONE WORD
</unc> wrong <,> to go to a university just to prepare for <unc> one
word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#94:1:A>
Universities are not meant to do that

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#95:1:A>
Technical institutions <,> short executive courses <,> short skills
courses are meant to do that <,> not a university

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#96:1:A>
Alright <,> so this is a principle sides

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#97:1:A>
But in practical <,> does it work

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#98:1:A>
It does work

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#99:1:A>
This year <,> I just heard on <,> the last day <,> uhm <,> uh I
just heard yesterday <,> that one of the largest most prestigious management
consultancy consulting firm in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#100:1:A>
They review offers to our students <,> including an offer to a
student who was who was doing <,> Speech and Hearing Sciences <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#101:1:A>
Another major employer <,> whose logo I  ' ve shown <,> <unc> 1
WORD </unc> three job offers to our graduates <,> this year  ' s final year
student

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#102:1:A>
They had not been recruiting new graduates for a number of years
<,> and one of them <,> is a Food and Nutrition Science student <,> and one
is a Statistics <?> student </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#103:1:A>
And I  ' ve four employers who would be coming to meet our students
<,> because I told their <unc> 1 WORD </unc> I say that four
employers and say you must come and meet those students

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#104:1:A>
Although they are their GPAs not high <,> their public examination
results in English Chinese and Mathematics <.> un </.> <.> un </.> uh
unremarkable <,> they are really very competent and motivated people

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#105:1:A>
Come <,> and see <,> I put my reputation on the table <,> come and
<unc> 1 WORD </unc> them

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#106:1:A>
And they say yes <,> I say gradually I  ' m not going to delegate
<unc> several-words </unc> <,> I am coming myself

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#107:1:A>
The chief executive is coming themselves

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#108:1:A>
And the students whom I  ' m going to refer to them Biology <,>
History <,> Fine Art <,> <unc> several WORDS </unc> and public
administration politics and public administration

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#109:1:A>
And I ask <unc> several-words </unc> why did you do <.>
pub </.> politics and public administration

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#110:1:A>
Because I like it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#111:1:A>
Good for you

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#112:1:A>
So why do you come to Hong Kong U

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#113:1:A>
Because the <,> students have a lot of fun at Hong Kong U

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#114:1:A>
I said <,> good for you <,> that  ' s the purpose of education

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#115:1:A>
And then people would say <,> that  ' s very well for you to say <,>
because you are paid by Hong Kong U <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#116:1:A>
But <,> my own two children <,> one has finished university <,>
one is doing a second year

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#117:1:A>
Both of them are in Literal Arts

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#118:1:A>
They went to <,> they study in Melbourne U <,> so I know <,> the
strength there and I can see <,> that  ' s why they said <,> overseas
university has some strength but they have something bad <,> they <unc>
several words </unc> that that my children do not have

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#119:1:A>
And <,> uh <,> and my yet elder son <,> gave up <,> turn down an
offer to do Business Administration for <,> Philosophy

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#120:1:A>
I said son <,> can you do <?> that </?> are you sure <,> there  ' s
no market in Philosophy

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#121:1:A>
He said why should I do Business Administration

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#122:1:A>
I know <unc> 2 WORDS </unc> <?> in the prospectus </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#123:1:A>
It  ' s common sense

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#124:1:A>
These are things that I can really <unc> one word </unc>
my own <,> and learn on my own

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#125:1:A>
Why should I waste three years of my youth <,> to do something
that I can read on my own

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#126:1:A>
I said why Philosophy

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#127:1:A>
Because I don't understand it <unc> 1 WORD </unc> read it
on my own I need somebody to explain it to me <,> <?> I said </?> good for
you <,> alright <,> and he kept on choosing <,> subject <unc>
several-words </unc> that he was poor at

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#128:1:A>
Instead of descriptive philosophy like the <.> Philo </.> Indian
Philosophy Chinese Philosophy <,> he chose metaphysics the Philosophy of
Science <,> which he <,> didn't score high <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#129:1:A>
And that is the purpose of education

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#130:1:A>
My younger one <,> had an offer to do Law <,> and if he really
push himself he can do a double degree <,> Law and Commerce

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#131:1:A>
Again he said <,> no

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#132:1:A>
See what is <unc> 2 WORDS </unc> I  ' ve been also believed
<unc> several words </unc> doing Japanese and Chinese

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#133:1:A>
So <,> I think <,> I put <,> my money when I  ' m <unc> 2 WORDS
</unc> <,> I put my children <unc> several words </unc> <,> and I
claim <,> looking at how they blossom <,> how they enjoy <,> their university
life

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#134:1:A>
How they grow as they  ' re <,> educated and I hope <,> ethical
person

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#135:1:A>
Not quite educated yet they  ' re still <,> on the way there <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#136:1:A>
But <,> this is what I <unc> several words </unc> in
myself <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#137:1:A>
Now <,> uh <,,> so <,> uh I just go then quickly into <,> uhm <,>
uh how universities in Hong Kong do this

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#138:1:A>
Of course we had our academic progress <,> which many of my
colleagues <,> from Hong Kong U and from the other institutions would have
<unc> 1 WORD </unc> to you

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#139:1:A>
And let me just show you some of the other non-academic programs
that we have

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#140:1:A>
And I  ' m sure <,> all the other institutions have similar programs

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#141:1:A>
In fact one of my colleagues <,> uhm <,> her daughter went to
Cambridge <,> study studies in the Cambridge study studying Chemistry in
Cambridge

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#142:1:A>
So during the holidays <,> she comes in <,> with her mom and <,>
and comes to our <?> fountain </?> she said then what is more fun studying in
Hong Kong U the students had more things to do than at Cambridge

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#143:1:A>
So I  ' m sure <,,> all the institutions in Hong Kong had various
programs <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#144:1:A>
Now we talk about <,> we prefer more <,> programs <,> and many of
these programs <,> involve <,> a student not just from Hong Kong <,> but
<unc> several words </unc> these programs <,> we usually include <,>
some from overseas and some from the Mainland

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#145:1:A>
Say a group of students from Architecture students from Harvard
<,> and some from <,> <foreign> Ching Wah </foreign> and <foreign> Fuk Daan
</foreign> <,> and Hong Kong <,> and Hong Kong U

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#146:1:A>
They spend one month together traveling to various cities <,> in
America in North America Europe and in the Mainland <,> and then they come
back <,> working a in a group are asked to redesign <,> a particular a
specific city in China

<ICE-HK:S2A-040#147:1:A>
So many of these programs uh uhm <,,> uhm <,> include uh the uh is
<,> uh is a is a multi <,> national group </I>
