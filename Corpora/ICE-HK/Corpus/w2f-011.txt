<ICE-HK:W2F-011#3:1>
First Night &swung-dash;

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#4:1>
Don't you tug me out !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#5:1>
So bright .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#6:1>
So cold .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#7:1>
Don't you hit my bottom !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#8:1>
Ah ... ah ... ah ... I must creep back .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#9:1>
I cry all night . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-011#10:1>
Second Night &swung-dash;

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#11:1>
Ha ha ha ha ha !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#12:1>
I  ' m flying !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#13:1>
I  ' m Superman !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#14:1>
You  ' re Monster !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#15:1>
I and little brother play all day .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#16:1>
So tired .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#17:1>
Mummy , don't throw away my old Robot No. 1 !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#18:1>
She is twisting off his head !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#19:1>
<it> You don't want a headless robot !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#20:1>
Right ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#21:1>
Woo ... You two go to bed NOW !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#22:1>
Or I won't cook sausages for school picnic tomorrow </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#23:1>
Can't , can't fall asleep .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#24:1>
Ah , Mummy taught me to count lambs ...

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#25:1>
1 lamb , 2 lambs , 3 lambs ...

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#26:1>
Jesus , let my robot go to heaven , and don't let me be late tomorrow
, sausages , chicken wings ... 4 lambs , 25 lambs ... last time Mummy dumped
me alone in the shopping mall ... 106 lambs ...

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#27:1>
Oops I want to pee .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#28:1>
I  ' m so afraid of the dark .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#29:1>
What sound is it ? ...

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#30:1>
Mum  ' s bedroom door is not all closed ...

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#31:1>
O Daddy and Mummy are fighting in bed ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-011#32:1>
Third Night &swung-dash; Shakespeare writes in <it> Twelfth Night
</it> , <quote> &ldquo; But be not afraid of greatness . <X>

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#X33:1>
Some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have
greatness thrust upon them. &rdquo; </X> </quote>

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#34:1>
Now , at fifteen , I know I  ' m born to shine , to be superb .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#35:1>
My name will appear among great men  ' s biographies .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#36:1>
I know it , like a religious believer knows God is calling him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#37:1>
A sage .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#38:1>
A world leader .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#39:1>
A U.N. President .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#40:1>
When I see war victims or street children on TV , I feel an
undeniable <it> urge </it> to save them .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#41:1>
What I wish most is to write an immortal classic , spend my whole
life to craft a marvellous piece .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#42:1>
A perfect plot !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#43:1>
Genius is 10&percent; inspiration and 90&percent; perspiration .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#44:1>
I stick to a timetable even on Sundays : </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-011#60:1>
Ah Dong , Ah Yan , Ki Ki , can't you shut up ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#61:1>
You all sound as if someone has switched on ten TVs !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#62:1>
I want to meditate , walk with Plato in a serene garden while the
time line intersects momentarily , and experience life .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#63:1>
Life that  ' s outside this goddamn three hundred square feet cell with
papa , mama , brother and two sisters all caged up and fighting !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#64:1>
Only in the dark and quiet night does the Muse kiss me like a tongue
of honey to help me write my story , &ldquo; Six Sleepless Nights &rdquo; :
<it> ...

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#65:1>
Life  ' s a flash .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#66:1>
Humans die without glimpsing what their lives mean .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#67:1>
All of us end up being corpses as stiff as frozen chickens .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#68:1>
History moves on , each new generation of rats sweeping away the old
one ... </it>

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#69:1>
Suddenly the character in my story jumps to life ! <it>

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#70:1>
Don't you try to dictate to my life ! </it> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-011#71:1>
Fourth Night &swung-dash;

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#72:1>
My brain is <it> churning , churning , churning ... </it>

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#73:1>
Can't be late tomorrow morning or my boss will fire me !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#74:1>
One day I  ' ll open my own company .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#75:1>
This place is driving me mad !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#76:1>
Symphony of phone calls !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#77:1>
Hundreds of faces everyday !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#78:1>
I forget their names right after they turn their heads away .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#79:1>
I lose my real face , too .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#80:1>
I feel an undeniable urge and joy when I cross out a finished task in
my schedule , bite and tear off my fingernails so that blood gushes out and
dyes my fingertips red , or when I squash a mosquito !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#81:1>
With two sick choking parents I can't stop squeezing every coin to
buy them salt water .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#82:1>
The balance in my account flicks all the time like pictures in a
jackpot machine .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#83:1>
Ah Dong is enjoying his master  ' s degree , hiding away from work !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#84:1>
This place doesn't let me think or breathe properly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#85:1>
I can't write a story or poem anymore .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#86:1>
They  ' re daisies that have no time to blossom .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#87:1>
Instead they mould and perish .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#88:1>
When I was a schoolboy , I hoped to grow fast .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#89:1>
Now I envy pupils .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#90:1>
They  ' re young , have a lot of charm to show off , time to waste and
friends to fool around with .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#91:1>
Haven't seen my high school buddies for years .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#92:1>
How are they ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#93:1>
Sometimes I wish the nights were longer .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#94:1>
Every morning the first beam of sunlight is no new hope but a whip
that makes me jump up and slave !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#95:1>
Star ....

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#96:1>
Someone in a far foreign place may be gazing at the same star , on
the Savanna of Africa , snowfield of Alaska .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#97:1>
Suddenly I realise I  ' m of a six million .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#98:1>
I cry all night . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-011#99:1>
Fifth Night &swung-dash;

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#100:1>
Sleepless , alone .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#101:1>
When you grow old , you don't need to sleep so much .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#102:1>
At midnight the city is silent .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#103:1>
Time freezes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#104:1>
Traffic stops .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#105:1>
Lamps turn off .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#106:1>
Darkness soothes me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#107:1>
Memories trap me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#108:1>
I  ' ve sweated my whole life , only to feed my apartment and harvest
more dust on my shoulders .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#109:1>
Fame is a gold ring on your ginger .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#110:1>
You love it when it  ' s new .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#111:1>
You almost forget it  ' s there when you get used to it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#112:1>
I own as many shares as wallpapers .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#113:1>
My living is as ashen as them .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#114:1>
Joy was as simple as a sausage for school picnic .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#115:1>
Now even fish wing tastes like stale chewing gum .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#116:1>
I desire simple thins , but I  ' ve lost most of them .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#117:1>
Every time I dust my parents  '  tomb , I wonder if the thirty square
centimetre cell is too crowded to stuff their bone ashes in .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#118:1>
I felt relieved the day they went .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#119:1>
My brother and sisters have all fled before the hand-over .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#120:1>
I am on my own .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#121:1>
I  ' m on my own .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#122:1>
I don't know how long the phone hasn't ringed , how long I haven't
talked to a friend .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#123:1>
The flat is too big , too quiet .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#124:1>
I wish the nights were shorter .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#125:1>
I even forget to turn the calendar .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#126:1>
What  ' s under the bottom drawer ? ... haven't I lost you , headless
Robot No. 1 ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#127:1>
And rough papers . <it>

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#128:1>
&ldquo; Pledge to Myself &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#129:1>
&ldquo; Six Sleepless Nights &swung-dash; First Night &rdquo; </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#130:1>
I can't help laughing .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#131:1>
Where did I get such a crazy idea ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#132:1>
I didn't change the world .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#133:1>
The world changed me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#134:1>
Aren't great men the same as us ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#135:1>
All were born naked like a ball of meat , flawed as humans are ,
fooled by chance throughout our lives , then go with the last sigh .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#136:1>
I was simple and naive .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#137:1>
I pity the young , romantic me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#138:1>
I admire him , too .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#139:1>
If only I can creep back to the past .... </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-011#140:1>
Last Night &swung-dash;

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#141:1>
Like a video tape rewinding : ...

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#142:1>
My first bucket of gold !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#143:1>
My first gold ring ....

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#144:1>
Don't ever roar at me , my boss !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#145:1>
I <it> fire </it> myself ! ...

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#146:1>
<it> Hi buddy , today  ' s your eighteenth birthday ! ...

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#147:1>
Don't you try to dictate to my life ! </it>

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#148:1>
I haven't finished my story .... <it>

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#149:1>
He  ' s your little brother Dong-dong .... </it>

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#150:1>
Daddy haha don't tickle me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#151:1>
Bad man !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#152:1>
Help , Mummy ....

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#153:1>
Mum , you  ' re pretty and good ....

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#154:1>
Don't try to dictate to my life !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#155:1>
I haven't finished it !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#156:1>
White light shimmers through the tunnel .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#157:1>
So bright .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#158:1>
I  ' m fleeing to a far foreign place .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#159:1>
Mum , Dad , you  ' re here . </p> </I>

<I> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#160:2>
<bold> ARABESQUE </bold> <fnr> 1 </fnr> </h> <footnote> Piano pieces
composed by Debussy .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#161:2>
<it> Arabesque I </it> and <it> II </it> are two pieces with very
different styles </footnote> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#162:2>
CLAIRE CHAN </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-011#163:2>
Again I hear the music .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#164:2>
It comes from the upper floor , the top of this nine-floor-building
, where people hang their clothes and dispose of old furniture .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#165:2>
No one lives on this floor but there is a wooden hut , which is
always locked .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#166:2>
No one knows what  ' s inside or who owns it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#167:2>
Gradually the residents has moved out of this 32-year-old building .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#168:2>
I am the only one living on the ninth floor .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#169:2>
These days I hear this irritating music .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#170:2>
I wonder if it comes from the wooden hut .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#171:2>
The piano piece is <it> Arabesque I </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#172:2>
It starts with a peaceful melody like a flowing river .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#173:2>
I almost fall asleep whenever I play it , but I like the forceful
part in the middle of the piece .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#174:2>
My performance is perfect , no mistakes and no pauses .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#175:2>
But my teacher shook her head .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#176:2>
I can't understand her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#177:2>
I ignore her and play <it> Arabesque II </it> instead .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#178:2>
I like <it> Arabesque II </it> more as it is more vivacious .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#179:2>
She sighs , but she cannot disapprove of my skill .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#180:2>
I  ' m sure the one upstairs doesn't possess my skill .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#181:2>
Although I dislike this piece , I know when it  ' s badly played .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#182:2>
It seems that the pianist is sight-reading , with a pause at every
two phrases .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#183:2>
The quality of the piano sound is disgusting .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#184:2>
It  ' s so hoarse that I cover my ears and shout , &lsquo; Stop ! Stop !
&rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#185:2>
The music continues .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#186:2>
I open my piano , sit on the chair and start playing <it> Arabesque
II </it> as a protest .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#187:2>
My nimble fingers produce a flawless performance .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#188:2>
Now I reach the climax .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#189:2>
I play it with the strongest force so that it totally drowns the
soft weak melody of <it> Arabesque I . </it>

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#190:2>
The music stops .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#191:2>
Smiling , I continue playing forcefully .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#192:2>
The next day I find a used yellow envelope in my mailbox .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#193:2>
Opening the envelope , I find a red heart-shaped card with a few
sentences written at the back .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#194:2>
&lsquo; Your performance is nearly perfect , but you miss one
important thing .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#195:2>
Now I give it to you ! &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#196:2>
Is this guy an idiot ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#197:2>
What does this fucking heart have to do with my perfect performance ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#198:2>
The loathsome red makes me sick .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#199:2>
I rip the card into halves and throw the pieces into a rubbish bin .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#200:2>
When I am about to begin practicing piano , damn it , that guy
upstairs plays the piece again !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#201:2>
I can't stand it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#202:2>
I decide to go upstairs to find out who is so annoying .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#203:2>
I climb up one floor and reach the top floor .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#204:2>
No one is there , but I hear the music from the wooden hut .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#205:2>
I approach and knock on the door .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#206:2>
&lsquo; Anyone in ? &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#207:2>
I ask .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#208:2>
The music stops .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#209:2>
The door is opened slowly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#210:2>
I see a broken piano and a girl in a white dress .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#211:2>
The hut is so small that it is almost fully occupied by the piano .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#212:2>
There is no chair for her to sit on .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#213:2>
The girl is so thin and pallid that she seems not to belong to this
world .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#214:2>
I am afraid she is too weak to speak , but she opens her mouth .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#215:2>
&lsquo; Are you from the ninth floor ? &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#216:2>
I nod my head .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#217:2>
&lsquo; Did you receive my heart ? &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#218:2>
I don't know how to respond .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#219:2>
I stare at her without blinking .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#220:2>
She sighs , &rsquo; You must find me stupid ! &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#221:2>
Changing the topic , I ask , &lsquo; Do you live in this building ?
&rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#222:2>
&lsquo; Yes , I live on the fourth floor . &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#223:2>
&lsquo; Why don't you play piano at home ? &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#224:2>
&lsquo; I  ' ve no piano at home , so I come here to play .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#225:2>
I guess someone didn't want this broken piano , so he just left it
here .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#226:2>
You know , this hut used to have a lot of rubbish in , but I cleared
it up and moved the piano in .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#227:2>
Now it is my private piano room ! &rsquo;

The girl flushes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#229:2>
&lsquo; Did you learn piano before ? &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#230:2>
&lsquo; Yes , but not now .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#231:2>
My family can't afford it anymore .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#232:2>
I really enjoy playing piano .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#233:2>
Every time I play <it> Arabesque I </it> , I immerse myself in the
music . &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#234:2>
I see a smile on her pink face .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#235:2>
&lsquo; But your fingers are too soft to play piano , and you make
too many mistakes . &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#236:2>
&lsquo; I know I  ' m not a skillful player , but I really like this
piece .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#237:2>
You guess what I can see when I play it ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#238:2>
I see myself lying on the grass .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#239:2>
On my right there is a river , my left a forest .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#240:2>
The breeze and the river flowing sound compose the melody of <it>
Arabesque I </it> . &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#241:2>
Abruptly she looks into my eyes and says , &lsquo; Do you see
anything when you play the piece ? &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#242:2>
&lsquo; Of course I see the score !

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#243:2>
Stupid ! &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#244:2>
I turn around and walk back to the ninth floor , leaving the girl
behind .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#245:2>
Since then , I did not hear the music again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#246:2>
I go upstairs to look for the girl but only find the vacant wooden
hut , with no girl and no piano .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#247:2>
I return to the fourth floor to ask the residents whether there is
such a girl , but no one knows her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#248:2>
I recall the red heart that she gave me , so I look for it in the
rubbish bin .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#249:2>
Finally , I find the two halves at the bottom of the bin .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#250:2>
I paste them together and stick the card on my piano .

<ICE-HK:W2F-011#251:2>
Sitting on my chair , I begin playing <it> Arabesque I </it> . </p>
