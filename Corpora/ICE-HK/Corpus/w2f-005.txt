TAI PING BAKERY </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-005#3:1>
I still remember the huge oven that looked like an ancient object
in Tai Ping .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#4:1>
Everyday at four , there was a queue outside the shop , as people
waited for the newly baked egg tarts .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#5:1>
I was only twelve years old .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#6:1>
Every Monday after school , I went to the bakery not far away from my
house .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#7:1>
<indig> Tai Ping </indig> was a small shop .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#8:1>
It was quite old with little decoration , but the raisin scones and
egg tarts were excellent .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#9:1>
The baker was called Old Chan .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#10:1>
He was an old man about sixty .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#11:1>
He liked to wear a white cotton hat as if he were an important cook .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#12:1>
The hat looked old and dirty .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#13:1>
It had not been washed for ages .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#14:1>
I stayed in the shop , standing by the little wood cupboard , and
watched him admiringly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#15:1>
He was such an amazing magician , changing the dried thyme baking
powder into hundreds of golden buns and scones .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#16:1>
I wished so much that I could be like him when I grew up , making
buns with different shapes and flavours .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#17:1>
Each time before I left the shop , Old Chan handed me a freshly baked
raisin scone .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#18:1>
Contented I carried this lovely little warm bread in my hands and
finished it before I got home .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#19:1>
Once , I came to <indig> Tai Ping </indig> a bit earlier than usual .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#20:1>
I saw Old Chan moving around and preparing his egg tarts .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#21:1>
He waved at me when he saw me and told me to take off my school bag .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#22:1>
It was quite unexpected , as I had never heard Old Chan talk &semi;
he worked in the shop day and night and never talked to anyone .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#23:1>
&ldquo; What have you put in your bag , little kid ? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#24:1>
He picked up my schoolbag and placed it slowly near the cupboard .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#25:1>
&ldquo; It  ' s as heavy as a stone . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#26:1>
He smiled at me , and turned around to the kitchen .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#27:1>
He was holding a white hat when he came out again and put it on my
head .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#28:1>
I saw his coarse hands and hefty fingers .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#29:1>
I had never seen those fingers before , almost like little fat bugs
moving in front of me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#30:1>
&ldquo; I guess you may need this , kid . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#31:1>
I was so excited .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#32:1>
I had never thought I could have a hat like Old Chan  ' s though it was
only made with a white towel .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#33:1>
&ldquo; Is it for me ? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#34:1>
Startled , I raised my head and looked at Old Chan .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#35:1>
&ldquo; Thank you very much . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#36:1>
&ldquo; Every baker needs a hat , you know . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#37:1>
Old Chan put his hand on my shoulder .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#38:1>
He started to teach me how to make the egg tart .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#39:1>
I followed him step-by-step and listened to his instructions
attentively .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#40:1>
Finally , the freshly baked golden brown egg tarts were done .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#41:1>
I tried to remove them from the oven , but they were hot .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#42:1>
&ldquo; Be careful , take this . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#43:1>
Old Chan handed me a pair of gloves .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#44:1>
I took the wire rack out slowly and placed the egg tarts on the
wooden table .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#45:1>
&ldquo; Oh , they look nice and delicious . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#46:1>
I was amazed by my own work .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#47:1>
Old Chan smiled at me and put his hand on my head .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#48:1>
&ldquo; You  ' re going to be a great baker . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#49:1>
Yes , I am going to be a baker .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#50:1>
I will make the most delicious cakes and breads in the world when I
grow up and I will open my own bakery like Old Chan , I told myself on my way
home .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#51:1>
But this time I did not eat my tart .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#52:1>
I placed it carefully in my lunch box and brought it to my mother .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#53:1>
I was eager to see my mum eating the first tart I had made .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#54:1>
I rushed into the kitchen as soon as I was home .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#55:1>
Mother was washing the carrots and preparing the soup for our dinner .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#56:1>
&ldquo; Mum , come on .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#57:1>
See what I  ' ve just made, &rdquo; I shouted , still carrying my
schoolbag .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#58:1>
I opened the lunch box and showed the egg tart to mum .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#59:1>
It was still warm and the egg cream looked stiff and glossy .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#60:1>
&ldquo; Where did you get that , honey ? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#61:1>
&ldquo; No , I didn't get it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#62:1>
I made it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#63:1>
I made it in Tai Ping . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#64:1>
I took out the tart carefully and handed it to mum and showed her
that she should have a bite .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#65:1>
&ldquo; Didn't I tell you many times that you should not go there on
your own and stay with that Old man ? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#66:1>
Mother looked angry .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#67:1>
&ldquo; He was Old Chan .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#68:1>
He  ' s the one who taught me how to make this tart . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#69:1>
I tried to defend Old Chan .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#70:1>
&ldquo; You know what , honey , he has some problem .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#71:1>
He  ' s sick and a kid like you shouldn't go there alone . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#72:1>
&ldquo; He  ' s not sick , mum .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#73:1>
You should talk to him and you will find him totally normal , like
you and me . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#74:1>
&ldquo; Everybody says he  ' s crazy .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#75:1>
He has stayed in the mental home for a long period of time . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#76:1>
&ldquo; But he must have gotten well if he could leave the mental
home . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#77:1>
I put the tart back into my lunchbox .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#78:1>
&ldquo; No one knows when he  ' s going to be mad again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#79:1>
I won't let you go to the bakery any more . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#80:1>
My mum turned off the tap and poured herself a glass of water .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#81:1>
&ldquo; I don't want to repeat myself again , do you hear me ?
&rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#82:1>
I did not reply and went to my room .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#83:1>
I took out the tart and ate it all by myself .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#84:1>
I didn't understand why people who had eaten Old Chan  ' s tarts and
scones still thought that he was sick .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#85:1>
How could a mad old man make these delicious cakes and bread ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#86:1>
I did not go to <indig> Tai Ping </indig> after that day .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#87:1>
Several times when I passed by the shop , I lingered a while , hoping
that I would see Old Chan and his scrumptious egg tarts and raisin scones
again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#88:1>
The last time I saw him was two years ago .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#89:1>
His large round face had lost some flesh and he looked very tired
beside the dark old oven .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#90:1>
After I got to secondary school , I seldom visited <indig> Tai Ping
</indig> and there were more and more newly opened bakeries around the area .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#91:1>
I didn't see Old Chan again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#92:1>
Some people said he had retired and moved back to China .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#93:1>
Others said he died of cancer .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#94:1>
I thought of him sometimes when I passed the bakery .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#95:1>
His smile , his fat little fingers , and the grimy cooking hat he
wore became part of my childhood memory .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#96:1>
And since then , I have never eaten any egg tarts and raisin scones
as delicious as those made by Old Chan . </p> </I>

<I> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-005#98:2>
It is past midnight , and the air is cooling outside .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#99:2>
I let the wind hit my face , and turn on my PC .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#100:2>
&ldquo; Du .... &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#101:2>
I leave the computer behind and go to the washroom .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#102:2>
<indig> Ah Ka </indig> is on the ICQ tonight &semi; we haven't
talked for almost a week .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#103:2>
I shouldn't say talk since you cannot talk through the computer
&semi; you can only send messages .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#104:2>
I send her a message &dash;

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#105:2>
hi , how are u ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#106:2>
Three minutes pass , and she still does not reply .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#107:2>
What does she want from me ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#108:2>
I have told her that I didn't meet her recently coz I was so busy
with my final year project .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#109:2>
But she never understands .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#110:2>
She says I stay too long with my computer .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#111:2>
The last time I saw her , she said to me &ldquo; I ain't not love
you . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#112:2>
The world has become so complicated and our love is not that simple
anymore .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#113:2>
There are too many things between us , and between those three
little words .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#114:2>
I hear the sound of the keys .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#115:2>
It must be father &semi; he drinks a lot lately .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#116:2>
We had a big fight yesterday .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#117:2>
He saw my new pair of Nike sport shoes and said I wasted too much
money .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#118:2>
I said he shouldn't drink that much if he wanted to save money .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#119:2>
And our battle started .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#120:2>
We used to be so close together , but since his factory closed down
in the Mainland two years ago , he drinks almost every night .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#121:2>
Mum is so upset , she says she can't help him , and several times I
hear her cry in the kitchen .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#122:2>
We haven't talked much since then .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#123:2>
Father likes to hide in the washroom when he is at home .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#124:2>
He would hold a bottle of Heineken in one hand and a packet of
Marlboro in the other , then spend his whole night there .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#125:2>
Sometimes I think he lives most of his time in his memory .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#126:2>
I didn't say anything to him this morning when we sat around the
table eating our breakfast .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#127:2>
My mum kept winking at me to signal that I should at least say Good
Morning .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#128:2>
I didn't look at her either .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#129:2>
I picked up my bag and left the house .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#130:2>
I met Father again on my way to my friend  ' s house this evening .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#131:2>
I didn't call him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#132:2>
He was standing in the bus stop across the street , holding his bag
, his colorless hair under the moonlight .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#133:2>
He looked so tired and his little bag seemed to be a big burden to
him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#134:2>
It  ' s been a long time since I really looked at him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#135:2>
I couldn't believe that the man who was standing in front of me was
the father who used to play tennis with me every Sunday morning &semi; who
taught me English and Mathematics and who used to be a big boss of a fabric
factory with over a hundred employees .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#136:2>
What has gone wrong with him ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#137:2>
I asked myself .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#138:2>
No , nothing has gone wrong &semi; he will be past 60 next year .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#139:2>
I had never really thought about that before &semi; that he is
fifteen years older than my mother .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#140:2>
He never takes the MTR .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#141:2>
He said it was better to take a bus as he could have natural air and
scenery on his way home .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#142:2>
But I knew it was not the reason .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#143:2>
The reason was that the railway cost 3 dollars more .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#144:2>
I used to think he was stupid , coz the 3 dollars might save him
half an hour .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#145:2>
The bus came and he drew out his coin bag .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#146:2>
It was the one that I gave him as a present on his 53-year-old
birthday .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#147:2>
I remember it cost all my savings to get this brown little leather
bag , and he looked so happy when he saw it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#148:2>
Finally , he got on the bus and I quickly jumped into the drugstore
and hid myself . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-005#149:2>
&ldquo; Father ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#150:2>
Is that you ? &rdquo; I say .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#151:2>
&ldquo; Uh ha . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#152:2>
I can smell the alcohol in the air .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#153:2>
I run into the kitchen and pour a cup of tea to him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#154:2>
He takes it and slaps me slightly on my shoulder .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#155:2>
&ldquo; Good son .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#156:2>
It  ' s time for bed . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#157:2>
I go back to my room &semi; <indig> Ah Ka </indig> still doesn't
answer me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#158:2>
I turn off the computer and throw myself onto the bed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#159:2>
I close my eyes and murmur , &ldquo; Goodnight , Papa ! &rdquo; </p>
</I>

<I> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#160:3>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-005#161:3>
The Autumn wind blew across me in the early morning .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#162:3>
It touched my hands , my face and my chest .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#163:3>
I shivered and tightened my clothes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#164:3>
Though it was early autumn I felt it was as cold as a late winter
day .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#165:3>
My house , the flowers , the grass , the trees and even a pebble
occupied my mind .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#166:3>
They resisted my steps .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#167:3>
I hesitated to leave my village , my home . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-005#168:3>
I walked down the path with heavy steps .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#169:3>
I could not help but to return back to the house .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#170:3>
It seemed older than before .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#171:3>
Bricks had been torn out and it had lost it  ' s colour .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#172:3>
This was the result of years of erosion by wind and rain .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#173:3>
But was my leaving the most important cause of the ageing ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#174:3>
The old , experienced house protested on in silence .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#175:3>
It seemed to warn me that there would be strong wind and rain
outside , and that no one would protect me from their attack . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-005#176:3>
I said sorry inside my heart .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#177:3>
I must go .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#178:3>
I wanted to see the outside world , I wanted to enrich myself , I
want to be independent .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#179:3>
I continued my journey .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#180:3>
Small wild autumn daisies were blooming at the side of the path .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#181:3>
They , the recluses , the retired scholars in the hills felt sorry
about my leaving since they were losing my companionship .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#182:3>
They bloomed with unhappiness , a deep hurt inside their hearts .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-005#183:3>
I avoided looking at their faces and sped up .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#184:3>
I was afraid that they would retain me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#185:3>
I came across a stream that was flowing to paddy fields . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-005#186:3>
I could hear the sound when water hit rocks and barriers in the
stream .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#187:3>
The sound was no longer a beautiful and nice song .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#188:3>
It was a crying voice .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#189:3>
It seemed to persuade me not to leave .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#190:3>
I attempted to comfort her but the crying became louder and louder .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#191:3>
I could not tolerate it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#192:3>
I used my hands to cover my ears and ran over the stone bridge
quickly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#193:3>
I had to resist the crying , escape from the faces of the house and
the daisies and everything in the village .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#194:3>
Finally I reached the bus stop .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#195:3>
I dashed into the bus . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-005#196:3>
The bus started .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#197:3>
I couldn't help looking through the window .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#198:3>
The wind breezed through the paddy field .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#199:3>
It caused wave after wave .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#200:3>
The paddy plants moved up and down .

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#201:3>
Were they waving to say goodbye to me ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-005#202:3>
The waves became smaller and smaller gradually and tears blurred my
sight . </p> </I>
