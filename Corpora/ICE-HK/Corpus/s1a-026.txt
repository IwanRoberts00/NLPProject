<[> Okay </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X50:1:Z>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X54:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#55:1:B>
Uhm well but uhm some of my colleagues uhm they well wherever

buildings <{> <[> in Hong Kong </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X56:1:Z>
<[> Yeah yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X57:1:Z>
<{> </[> Okay okay </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#58:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm uhm uhm </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X59:1:Z>
So they kept making the comparison <{> <[> between </[> Hong Kong

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#60:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#61:1:B>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X62:1:Z>
Yeah uhm what <,> what did they do for you the trip

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X63:1:Z>
Did you did you discover anything about yourself </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#64:1:A>
Uhm yeah I think

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#65:1:B>
Yah very much

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X66:1:Z>
<{> <[> What </[> what did you

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X67:1:Z>
You said you were stranger or odd that was the word you use <{>
<[> you said you were </[> <unc> one word </unc> did you discover
that in England or did you know that <{> <[> already </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#68:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#69:1:B>
<[> Yah yah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#70:1:B>
<[> Uh </[> </{> I I know that already but uhm such feeling was so
strong uhm when I was staying in England

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#71:1:B>
Uhm especially when uhm I liked to do everything that is different
from all all <{> <[> my </[> friends like to do

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#72:1:B>
And uhm for example I went very berry picking

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#73:1:B>
I I liked to go to the art galleries but

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X74:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X75:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#76:1:B>
None of them want to go there

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X77:1:Z>
Right right okay

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X78:1:Z>
And what about you <{> <[> Patrick </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#79:1:A>
<[> Uh </[> </{> yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X80:1:Z>
Did you discover anything about yourself </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#81:1:A>
I love the culture the and the culture of uh Britain

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X82:1:Z>
<{> <[> Uhm </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#83:1:A>
<[> And </[> </{> when uh there were uh two times that uh the
trip was guided by a tourist guide and I try my tried my best to ask as many
as as many as <.> pro </.> questions as <{> <[> I could </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X84:1:Z>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#85:1:A>
And so uh I feel very interested in uh why there  ' s such a
building and why there were so <.> di </.> <.> man </.> so many uh different
types of people

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X86:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#87:1:A>
Ruled uh this country and I I  ' ve

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X88:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#89:1:A>
I  ' m quite new about the the the name Normans

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X90:1:Z>
Yeah yeah <{> <[> yeah </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#91:1:A>
<[> Uh </[> </{> Romans because I don't think uh in Britain
there <,> there were so many different <{> <[> era </[> in the past

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X92:1:Z>
<[> Yeah yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X93:1:Z>
Different groups of people <{> <[> coming </[> in

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X94:1:Z>
You were both in Lancaster </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#95:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#96:1:B>
Yah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X97:1:Z>
Yeah <,> ah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#98:1:A>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X99:1:Z>
What was the weather like

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X100:1:Z>
Was it good </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#101:1:B>
I can say that uh the weather is just like women

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X102:1:Z>
Oh what does that mean <{> <[> so </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#103:1:B>
<[> Nothing </[> </{> to tell

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X104:1:Z>
Nothing <{> <[> to </[> tell </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#105:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X106:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#107:1:A>
I think so

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#108:1:A>
Same feeling

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X109:1:Z>
Same feeling </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#110:1:A>
<{> <[> Yeah </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X111:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#112:1:B>
Before that I I I didn't believe that saying but after I have
been to Lancaster I believe so

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X113:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#114:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#115:1:A>
<{> <[> Sometimes </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X116:1:Z>
<[> Get </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X117:1:Z>
You can't describe it </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#118:1:B>
Cannot

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X119:1:Z>
No you can't describe it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#120:1:A>
And sometimes my feeling will be affected by the bad weather

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#121:1:A>
For example uh uh there was a trip to <unc> two words
</unc> Victorian Fair and <{> <[> remember </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#122:1:B>
<[> It was </[> </{> raining

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#123:1:A>
Yeah it rained heavily

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X124:1:Z>
Yah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#125:1:A>
And we can't enjoy <?> ourself </?> quite much because we
have <{> <[> to go </[> inside the shop <{> <[> because of the </[> rain

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#126:1:B>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X127:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm uhm uhm </[> </{> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#128:1:B>
<{> <[> Yeah </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X129:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> yeah yeah okay

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X130:1:Z>
So when you came back from uh Lancaster and all that bad weather
did you did you see anything different in Hong Kong </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#131:1:B>
Yeah especially the pace of life

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X132:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#133:1:B>
Uhm <&> tut </&> well in fact uhm <&> tut </&> something I I
have a very strong feeling about is uhm when <&> tut </&> the amount of the
assignments uh yeah that  ' s that  ' s very terrible and uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X134:1:Z>
Where was this

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X135:1:Z>
In Lancaster </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#136:1:B>
Yah <{> <[> but </[> uh it  ' s very unnecessary

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#137:1:B>
And uhm I  ' ve talked to my lectures uh but they <.> s </.> they
said uhm they were sorry and they could not do anything and

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X138:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X139:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#140:1:B>
Well uhm <&> tut </&> but I I think uhm <{> <[> may </[> be
the students in Hong Kong they are used to uhm the examination <{> <[> system
</[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#141:1:B>
And they just do and do and do and without asking why

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X142:1:Z>
<[> Some </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X143:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X144:1:Z>
So you but but you are still talking about Lancaster that you had
too many assignments to do </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#145:1:B>
Yeah <{> <[> because </[> the <{> <[> the </[> Hong Kong uh
uhm the Hong Kong Education Department asked them to give us <{> <[> so much
</[> assignments

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X146:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X147:1:Z>
<[> What what </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X148:1:Z>
<[> Aw I see </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X149:1:Z>
<{> <[> So </[> they were obliged to that

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X150:1:Z>
Did <{> <[> did </[> you feel the same

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X151:1:Z>
Patrick were <{> <[> you </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#152:1:B>
<[> So </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#153:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#154:1:A>
<[> Yeah <[> </{> yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X155:1:Z>
<{> <[> Yeah </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#156:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X157:1:Z>
And what what what effect did the do do you think you could have
got more out of the whole of out of the course if you had not had so many
assignments

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X158:1:Z>
Do you think you would have enjoyed enjoy yourself more or </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#159:1:B>
Sure

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X160:1:Z>
See more about the culture and <{> <[> yeah </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#161:1:B>
<[> Yah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#162:1:A>
Uhm uhm uhm yeah but uhm <,,> the uhm for me <{> <[> uhm </[>
I enjoy the life in Lancaster University <{> <[> because </[> I quite often
went to the gym to do some exercise

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X163:1:Z>
<[> Oh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X164:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X165:1:Z>
Uh workout </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#166:1:A>
And in Hong Kong uh although I I  ' m in the tertiary education
but in the college there  ' s no such a big gym for me to <{> <[> to do </[>
what I would like to <{> <[> do </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X167:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X168:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X174:1:Z>
Uhm <{> <[> uhm </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#175:1:A>
<[> It  ' s </[> </{> a problem for me and but on the other

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X176:1:Z>
<[> Okay </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X177:1:Z>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#317:1:A>

If the college said you don't have to do anything </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#323:1:A>
Uh uh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X324:1:Z>
You can just attend the classes and you  ' ll get your certificate

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#325:1:A>
<&> tut </&> ]

No </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#328:1:B>
No uh for the uhm I think it would be better if uhm the

<{> <[> And then </[> we can have much time to do our assignments

<$Z> <X>

<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X331:1:Z>

the </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#332:1:B>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X337:1:Z>
And what about you Pat </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#338:1:A>
Sometimes uh I  ' ll I will read some magazine in the library
and I think at that time I think if I do not get so many assignment to do my
school life in the college will be much better

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X339:1:Z>
Right <{> <[> because you </[> have the chance to read and <{>
<[> <,> </[> broaden your knowledge and yah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#340:1:A>
<[> I can read </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#341:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#342:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X343:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X344:1:A>
Okay </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#345:1:A>
For example uh I plan I try to <.> p </.> plan uh one I <.> w
</.> if I had <.> ti </.> had I if I had the time I would read uh some
magazine <.> t </.> twice a week in <{> <[> the library </[> <{> <[> or </[>
spend uh two hours in the library twice a week but I you finally I could it

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X346:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X347:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X348:1:Z>
You can't do <{> <[> it yeah </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#349:1:A>
<[> But I can't </[> </{> do it

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X350:1:Z>
<{> <[> Right </[> </X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#351:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X352:1:Z>
Yeah I think that  ' s the same with everyone

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X353:1:Z>
Uh I think people of serious problems

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X354:1:Z>
And teachers a well you are going into a profession and teachers
are killing themselves in Hong Kong </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#355:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#356:1:B>
Yah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X357:1:Z>
Is <{> <[> that uhm </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#358:1:B>
<[> Yah yah </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X359:1:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X360:1:Z>
When you were on teaching practice did you feel any any of that
kind of pressure </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#361:1:B>
Yeah very much

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X362:1:Z>
Really </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#363:1:B>
Yah uh I can I could only sleep for uhm <&> tut </&> about
four hours everyday during my TP period

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X364:1:Z>
Really </X>

<$B> Yah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X365:1:Z>
Why what what what were you doing </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#366:1:B>
Writing my lesson plans

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X367:1:Z>
But these teachers don't have lesson plans because they are real
teachers and they don't need lesson plans but because you are not real
teacher

<ICE-HK:S1A-026#X368:1:Z>
Uhm so why do you think they are under so much pressure teachers
in Hong Kong </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-026#369:1:B>
The workload <{> <[> and </[> uhm sometimes uhm the students
are very naughty and uhm the worse is that uhm many of the parents they they
