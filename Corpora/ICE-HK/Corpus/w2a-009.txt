<ICE-HK:W2A-009#2:1>
Developments in post-structuralist theories and post-colonial
theories have led to an exploration of the issue of translation and power in
Translation Studies in the last few decades .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#3:1>
The &lsquo; death of the author &rsquo; , first discussed by Roland
Barthes , was followed by Michel Foucault  ' s discourse on power , and then by
the dethronement of the &lsquo; original &lsquo; and the demystification of
the metaphysical primacy of origin in the work of Jacques Derrida and the
deconstruction school of critics .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#4:1>
Drawing from these insights , translation theorists have re-examined
the ideology of fidelity that has for long governed the practice of
translation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#5:1>
They have analyzed how the notion of translation as derivative from ,
and subservient to , the source text rose to prominence .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#6:1>
Subsequently they have exposed this notion as a historical and
ideological construct rather than an ontological given .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#7:1>
Furthermore , they have affirmed &obrack; through rereading Walter
Benjamin &cbrack; the power of translation to provide a new lease of life
&dash; an afterlife &dash; for the &lsquo; original &rsquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#8:1>
Post-colonial translation theorists , meanwhile , have alerted us to
the unequal power relations that always already exist in the transfer of
texts across cultures , and to the operation of translation as the
ideological handmaid of imperialism .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#9:1>
This ties in with studies on norms of translation &dash; first
initiated by proponents of the poly-system theory such as Itamar Even-Zohar
and Gideon Toury .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#10:1>
And , lately , Theo Hermans placed his study of norms within the
framework of translation and power by analyzing them as complex social and
cultural realities which translators , as active social agents , have to work
with or against in every stage of the process of translation &obrack; Hermans
1996 &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-009#11:1>
The purpose of this article is to take the issue of translation
and power further and examine it from a broader sociological perspective .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#12:1>
The emphasis will not be on &ldquo; the study and practice of
translation &obrack; as &cbrack; inevitably an exploration of power
relationships within textual practice that reflect power structures within
the wider cultural context &rdquo; &obrack; Bassnett 1996 : 21 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#13:1>
The emphasis , instead , is on translation as an activity and how
such an activity &dash; carried out in a particular historical context &dash;
allowed the translators gain access to power .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#14:1>
The focus is on the Protestant missionary-translators based in Hong
Kong from 1842 until the end of the nineteenth century , and the examination
will be divided into three parts : &obrack; 1 &cbrack; translators as
wielders of power and as policy makers; &obrack; 2 &cbrack; translators as
propagators of ideology; and &obrack; 3 &cbrack; translators as intellectual
gladiators and ideological gatekeepers ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-009#15:1>
One point that must be stressed is the context of Hong Kong from
1842 until the end of the nineteenth century .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#16:1>
At that time , Hong Kong had a system of government more similar to
those of other British colonies in the world than that of China in the Qing
Dynasty .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#17:1>
It was run by a succession of governors whose allegiance was to the
Queen of the United Kingdom rather than to the Emperor of China , but it was
separated from China only by a border which remained open for most of the
time , and it was inhabited by an overwhelming majority of Chinese whose ties
with their homeland were so strong that they mostly considered Hong Kong only
as a temporary home .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#18:1>
Given this unique situation , it is necessary to analyze the impact
of the work of the Protestant missionary-translators not only with reference
to Hong Kong but also to China .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#19:1>
In other words , one needs a pair of bifocal glasses &dash; to look
near and afar , at Hong Kong as well as further afield at China .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#20:1>
And this is the approach I shall adopt in this article . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#21:1>
<bold> Translators as wielders of power and policy makers </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-009#22:1>
The Opium War and the conclusion of the Treaty of Nanking
&obrack; 1842 &cbrack; made Hong Kong a British colony .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#23:1>
To the Protestant missionaries who had been trying for decades to
evangelize China , this was a god-sent opportunity .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#24:1>
Hong Kong became not only their target for the spread of Christianity
but also a place where they could gain a foothold in China .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#25:1>
Being a colony , Hong Kong also provided them with a degree of
freedom , a kind of protection , and space for manoeuvre they could not
possibly enjoy in the other five treaty ports which were open to foreign
trading and missionary activities as a result of the 1842 Treaty .After 1842
, therefore , there was quite a gathering of Protestant missionaries in Hong
Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#26:1>
They came from different missionary societies and different nations ,
making up an intercultural group that is particularly worthy of study . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-009#27:1>
Many in this group were , as it were , Renaissance men : they
were translators , intellectual heavyweights , polyglots , scholars , and
missionaries all rolled into one .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#28:1>
Through their work of translation , whether it was the translation of
official government documents , of the Bible into Chinese , or of Chinese
literary and philosophical texts into English , they established their
credibility as competent mediators of cultures .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#29:1>
This credibility , in turn , provided them with opportunities unheard
of by their counterparts working in the treaty ports and other parts of China .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#30:1>
For in the first two decades immediately after Hong Kong  ' s secession
to Britain , there were few people within the Hong Kong government who could
claim competence in Chinese .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#31:1>
The administration desperately needed people whom they could trust
and who could be relied upon not only for communication with the Chinese ,
but also for advice on policies that would have a direct impact on the 1ife
of the populace .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#32:1>
The allegiance of the local Chinese was doubtful .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#33:1>
The community of traders and foreign merchants had to attend to their
own interests .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#34:1>
There was , in a manner of speaking , a brain vacuum within the
administration .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#35:1>
A power vacuum , too , that threatened effective administration of
the colony . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-009#36:1>
This power vacuum was filled by the Protestant missionaries .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#37:1>
Not any Protestant missionaries , not even those who could speak
Cantonese and/or Mandarin , but missionaries whose command of the language
was proven by their work of translation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#38:1>
Certainly that was how John Morrison &obrack; 1814-1843 &cbrack; ,
Karl G&uumlaut;tzlaff &obrack; 1803-1851 &cbrack; , James Legge &obrack;
1815-1897 &cbrack; , and E . J . Eitel &obrack; 1838-1908 &cbrack; rose to
prominence .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#39:1>
The government believed that they were experts on Chinese culture and
authorities on the mind of the Chinese populace in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#40:1>
Such a perception was not necessarily correct , of course .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#41:1>
But this was the context in which the relation between translation
and power unfolded . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-009#42:1>
These four Protestant missionary-translators made use of their
positions to exert an influence on the governor of the time .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#43:1>
All four succeeded to wield power in the formulation of government
policies .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#44:1>
From 1843 to 1897 &obrack; the year when Eitel retired from the Hong
Kong government &cbrack; , they took turns to formulate policies on education
and these became official government policies which were fully implemented in
Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#45:1>
John Morrison used his influence on Henry Pottinger , the first
governor of Hong Kong , to obtain permission for the Morrison School to move
from Macau to Hong Kong in 1842 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#46:1>
In addition , be smoothed the way for the permission to the London
Missionary Society to have their Anglo-Chinese College &obrack; then based in
Malacca &cbrack; move to Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#47:1>
The opening of these two schools marked the beginning of the
development of Western education by the Protestant missionaries in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#48:1>
The two schools &lsquo; emphasis on teaching the English language and
western knowledge also institutionalized an educational practice distinctly
different from the traditional orthodox Chinese educational practice .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#49:1>
Karl G&uumlaut;tzlaff , who succeeded John Morrison as Chinese
Secretary upon Morrison  ' s death on 29 August 1843 , likewise used his
influence and persuaded Pottinger to introduce the grant-in-aid system , thus
marking the beginning of the development of public education in Hong Kong
&lsquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#50:1>
James Legge , a Non-Conformist opposed to the Anglican attempt to
enforce religious teaching in government schools , also gained great
influence in the government .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#51:1>
Significantly , this happened after the publication , in 1861 , of
the first of his monumental eight-volume work of translation &dash; <it>
Chinese Classics </it> &dash; which , in addition to translations , carried
extensive notes and commentaries .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#52:1>
He was able to push through his plan for educational reforms , which
promoted secular education at the expense of religious education , and which
made the teaching of English a prominent part of the curriculum in government
schools in Hong Kong !

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#53:1>
To facilitate the teaching of English , Legge translated from English
George Baker  ' s <it> Graduated Reading : Comprising A Circle of Knowledge ,
in 200 Lessons </it> for use as textbooks .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#54:1>
He also established Central College &dash; an amalgamation of the
three largest government schools in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#55:1>
His plan was to utilize the limited resources of the government to
develop the college into a model of secular education for other schools to
follow .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#56:1>
Education for the elite was thus introduced into Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-009#57:1>
E. J. Eitel  ' s ascension to power was likewise the result of
his achievements in the field of translation and Sinology .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#58:1>
He was as influential as Legge though , being a strong advocate of
religious education , his policy manoeuvres were aimed to check the dominance
of secular education in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#59:1>
In this he was largely successful .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#60:1>
Six years after Legge had left Hong Kong and beginning from 1879 , a
trend emerged whereby secular education was practised in government schools
and religious education in missionary schools . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#61:1>
Another trend established by Eitel was the government  ' s gradual
withdrawal from vernacular education to channel resources into a grant scheme
designed primarily for missionary schools .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#62:1>
And if Legge  ' s introduction of the teaching of English was meant to
train students with bilingual abilities , then under Eitel  ' s regime , there
was a deliberate change of policy and a new initiative to promote English
education for the elite . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-009#63:1>
It is clear , therefore , that these translators were not only
translators , they were translators with a mission &dash; namely to change
the hearts and minds of people and convert them to Christianity through both
secular and religious education .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#64:1>
They might not have succeeded in this .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#65:1>
And yet the policies they made had far-reaching consequences for the
development of education in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#66:1>
Even today , many schools in Hong Kong are still run by missionaries .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#67:1>
There are still grant-in-aid schools .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#68:1>
The liberal arts tradition still runs strong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#69:1>
Most significant of all , the policy of elitist education &dash; the
heritage of Legge , intentional or otherwise &dash; and the privileging of
English-language education over and above mother-tongue education &dash; the
deliberate manoeuvre of Eitel &dash; have influenced the attitudes of
generations of Hong Kong Chinese .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#70:1>
Even now , many still believe in the superiority of prestigious
English-language schools . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-009#71:1>
The policies laid down by these Protestant missionary-translators
also had far-reaching consequences on the evolution of society .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#72:1>
Their emphasis on teaching the English language met the urgent
commercial needs of Hong Kong as well as the administrative needs of the
government at the time .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#73:1>
The western style education they promoted produced many graduates who
were fairly outward looking and who could facilitate interaction between the
East and the West .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#74:1>
Within a few decades after its becoming a colony , therefore , Hong
Kong was transformed into a society relatively more westernized and more
liberal in outlook than the society in Imperial China .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#75:1>
This was due in no small measure to the influence of these Protestant
missionary-translators , though there was a host of other complex factors as
well .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#76:1>
Bearing in mind that Western-style education did not manage to take
root in China until the Imperial Examination was officially abolished in 1905
, the impact these missionary-translators left in Hong Kong is even more
obvious

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#77:1>
Whether such an impact is positive , negative , or both , is a moot
question &dash; it was so in the past , it is so in the present , it probably
will be so in the future .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#78:1>
But what emerges clearly from the above analysis is that these
Protestant missionary-translators were great opportunists .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#79:1>
They took full advantage of the leverage they gained through their
activity of translation and established themselves within the power structure
of the colonial government .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#80:1>
Not only that .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#81:1>
With their policies on education , they played a leading role in the
identity reconstruction programme &dash; that is , in the moulding of the
Other in the image of one  ' s Self &dash; which is one of the cornerstones of
the power politics of colonialism .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#82:1>
In short , they had helped to turn Hong Kong into a translation and a
copy , albeit an &lsquo; inferior &lsquo; copy and a &lsquo; bad &lsquo;
translation , of its colonial master . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#83:1>
<bold> Translators as propagators of ideologies </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-009#84:1>
All missionaries were committed to the propagation of the
Christian faith/ideology .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#85:1>
The crucial role , however , was played by the missionary-translators .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#86:1>
For they were responsible for the translation into Chinese of the
Bible &dash; that most sacred embodiment of the precepts of Christianity .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#87:1>
Many missionary-translators , in Hong Kong as well as in China , had
been involved in this task , as the Bible saw many translations and revisions
from 1842 until the end of the nineteenth century .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#88:1>
But it was a missionary-translator in Hong Kong who emerged as the
most dynamic , most entrepreneurial , and most controversial propagator of
the Christian ideology &dash; Karl G&uumlaut;tzlaff .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#89:1>
When the Taiping Uprising &obrack; 1850-1864 &cbrack; &dash; the
largest anti-Manchu rebellion in nineteenth century China broke out , it was
G&uumlaut;tzlaff  ' s 1840 Bible , which saw many editions within that decade ,
which was adopted as the Taiping Bible , not the other Chinese translations
of the Bible available at the time .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#90:1>
Even though the Delegates &lsquo; Version soon appeared &obrack; New
Testament &dash; 1852; Old Testament &dash; 1854 &cbrack; and was considered the
most authoritative by most missionaries working in China , it did not replace
G&uumlaut;tzlaff  ' s Bible in subsequent editions of the Taiping Bible .

<ICE-HK:W2A-009#91:1>
As the Taipings were mostly members of a religious society &obrack;
called God Worshippers or <it> <indig> Bai Shangdi Hui </indig> </it>
&cbrack; whose initial aim , according to Hong Xiuquan <O> Chinese-characters
</O> the founder , was to destroy demons and idols and to bring China back to
the worship of the true God , the Taiping Bible belonged to the canonical
literature of the God Worshippers and formed part of the basis of their
beliefs &dash; an eclectic blend of Christian , Buddhist , and Confucian
doctrines and ideas . </p> </I>
