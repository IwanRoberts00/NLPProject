<I> 

<$A>  <ICE-HK:S2A-021#1:1:A>
Yeah thank you <.> ch </.> uh chairlady
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#2:1:A>
I think uh it  ' s always the best for the for the one to to speak
first because uh other uh uh uh uh other speakers will have to follow uh
things which I have already spoken uh uh
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#3:1:A>
So I better take a lead here
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#4:1:A>
Uhm the uhm the whole thing about comparing Hong Kong and China or
or Western accounting and China and Chinese accounting is uh pretty basic in
the sense that in the a foreign environment where you have accounting and
where you have a uh uh books and the <.> ac ac </.> accounting profession et
cetera and the accounting laws
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#5:1:A>
Those are real accounts
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#6:1:A>
Whereas in China the accounting laws are actually tax based i e they
don't differentiate between what is required in in in in tax regulations and
what actually happens in uh in terms of accounting because if you look at the
accounting law of China and they are very much uh uh uh predicated by what
the tax authorities want to do
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#7:1:A>
For example they will preset the uh depreciation of uh that uh that
uh that uh certain fixed <.> as </.> assets should be and they also preset uh
things like you cannot have bad debts or whatever because those are basically
from a tax concept
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#8:1:A>
Uhm as far as the accounting profession is concerned China is still
fairly new and the uh Accounting uh Society was only formed in the early
eighties
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#9:1:A>
And they  ' ve just had their first examination in uh December last <.> 
ye </.> last year
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#10:1:A>
Uh I think twenty four thousand people applied to sit for the exam
and only twelve thousand turned up <,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#11:1:A>
Uh not not <?> bad </?> simply because uhm in China if you fail
your examinations you cannot uh there is a preset limit uh on the number of
chances you can take it
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#12:1:A>
So therefore if you are not prepared better not sit it
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#13:1:A>
Uh I don't think it applies to the new HKSA at the moment <,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#14:1:A>
Uhm as far as uh the accounting firms are concerned uh when I first
look at the accounting law <.> th </.> uh regulating the certified public
accounting firms I was so surprised to find that they call the accounting
firms a service institution
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#15:1:A>
Service <.> insti </.> institution in the sense that it is not a
profit making body
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#16:1:A>
Whereas <.> ac </.> accounting firms in <.> Ch </.> in outside of
China these are run as businesses
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#17:1:A>
In China what they say is that uh the accounting firms are purely a
service to help the country to modernize
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#18:1:A>
To help the country in its economic development
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#19:1:A>
Therefore <,> uh the accountants serve very much as part of the state
and as part of the state organ
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#20:1:A>
Hence there  ' s a lot of uh uh question about people saying that
should there be uh <.> wou </.> is there any independence
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#21:1:A>
When you read an account uh an audit report now bearing
in mind that the accounts the the chap who sign the accounts are state
officials
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#22:1:A>
Therefore you you will ask is that the same thing as an independent
accounting <?> no </?> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#23:1:A>
Does an independent accountant uh exist in China
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#24:1:A>
These are real concerns especially when uh when foreign investors
try to go into China and uh and and and look at the records and they will
never be sure uh the records they look at are in fact what actually happens
or is this just some configuration uh dreamt up or or supported by
some state uh directive <,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#25:1:A>
Uh I am happy to say that in China there is no professional
liability as such
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#26:1:A>
But uh in Hong Kong and in <.> an </.> anywhere else Hong Kong is
rated the the the the most uh uh high risk area in in line with New York
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#27:1:A>
Uh in a scale of ten Hong Kong rank risk ten
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#28:1:A>
 <.> Tha </.> That is full marks for for for for risks
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#29:1:A>
Uh <,> this doesn't mean that international firms moving into China won't
uh won't won't get sued because invariably when you are international firm
when you move into China what happens is that the clients look to you as an
international setup and not as a PRC setup
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#30:1:A>
So therefore we cannot absolve our uh uh liabilities
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#31:1:A>
Now I I have to stop here because there will be a lot other uh uh
aspects to cover
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#32:1:A>
Okay </I> 


 <I> 

<$A>  <ICE-HK:S2A-021#33:2:A>
Thank you Mrs Chow
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#34:2:A>
Uh <,> before I make any comment I want to make a disclaimer as a
professional uh <,> attitude because before I came I <.> th </.> I didn't
know that I <?> am </?> representing HKSA
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#35:2:A>
Uh in fact I don't know <,,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#36:2:A>
Uh in fact I I think HKSA uh may not know I come to represent them
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#37:2:A>
So <,> I better say the comment I make today is <,> myself
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#38:2:A>
It  ' s nothing to do with HKSA 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#39:2:A>
About the uh reporting requirement setting as far as I know 
which were laid down by the uh Ministry of Finance <,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#40:2:A>
Uh the the control in China is that all CPA firm <,> are governed by a
professional institution which is <.> Ch </.> uh <.> Ch </.> CICPA Chinese
Institute of Certified Public Accountants <,>  which is under the Ministry of
Finance <,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#41:2:A>
And all reporting requirement basically from uh Ministry of Finance
as well <,> ********
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#42:2:A>
Mrs Chow talked about state-own enterprise and joint venture <,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#43:2:A>
Uh in fact it  ' s true <,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#44:2:A>
They are basically two as far as I understand two two sets of uh uh
systems <,> using in China
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#45:2:A>
One set is for state own enterprises <,> and the other one is for joint
ventures <,,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#46:2:A>
Based on my observation <,> the state own enterprises system basically
is a fund accounting which is to <,>  to uh record the source and the application
of funds <,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#47:2:A>
And then at the end of the financial period they will report it
through several financial statements such as uh <,>  uh what they call <,> the Balance
of Funds Statements <,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#48:2:A>
And then they also have uh uh Income Statements but uh they are
very much related to operations of the enterprise <,,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#49:2:A>
This kind of system is not allowed for examples in Hong Kong because
in Hong Kong uh <.> s </.> if I remember correctly should be set <?> two </?> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#50:2:A>
We cannot do reserve accounting
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#51:2:A>
But there is a lot of reserve accountings in China I mean
particularly in state own enterprises <,,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#52:2:A>
Uh <,> I first read a set of financial statements about state
own enterprise in China is about two years ago
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#53:2:A>
I spent probably half an hour to understand one accounting entry
which is the purchase of fixed asset <,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#54:2:A>
So I must say it  ' s quite confusing to the Western accountant <,,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#55:2:A>
But now the the in China there are a lot of uh state own
enterprises
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#56:2:A>
They <.> w </.> they want to to change their status from a state
own enterprises to to to a a company with share capital and then to list the
shares in the stock exchange <,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#57:2:A>
So the hot topic nowadays is how to convert a state own enterprise
into a share <?> with </?> share capital company
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#58:2:A>
It  ' s better to say in Chinese but difficult to a little bit uh to
transfer it translate it into English <,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#59:2:A>
Uh if I if allow me to talk in in in Chinese the different name as
far as we are concern we call privatization
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#60:2:A>
But in China privatization has a different meaning <,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#61:2:A>
So in Chinese they call it <indig> Gu Fan Chai </indig> <,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#62:2:A>
But in English as as far as we are concern they are all
privatization
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#63:2:A>
That means to to convert a state own enterprise into a company with
share capital <,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#64:2:A>
Okay talk about the the joint venture
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#65:2:A>
Uh under the joint venture the accounting <?> rules </?> specific
accounting <?> rule </?> for joint ventures <,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#66:2:A>
And they are the the bible put it this way for the joint venture
accounting personnel <,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#67:2:A>
All the requirement in that joint venture accounting <?> rule </?> 
is very much like international accounting standard <,> except several key areas <,> 
which are the provisions basically the provisions <,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#68:2:A>
The provision for <?> obsolete </?> stock the provision for
doubtful debts <,> and they don't allow to account for the unrealized
exchange differences <,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#69:2:A>
And these are the three main area that concern the Western accountants <,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#70:2:A>
On top of that they also do not allow the <.> reac </.>  <?> 
revaluation </?> of fixed assets or any asset at all <,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#71:2:A>
This is understandable because they are using historical cost
convention <,,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#72:2:A>
Therefore from our standpoint the joint venture accounting is very
much like IAS with a little bit uh modifications
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#73:2:A>
But in a state own enterprise it  ' s very very different <,,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#74:2:A>
I think <?> they  '  re </?> the comments I I want to make at this point
 </I> 


 <I> 

<$A>  <ICE-HK:S2A-021#75:3:A>
Yes me again
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#76:3:A>
Uh <,> I I I  ' m not aware of any uh law or accounting pronouncement in
China regarding the conversion of a state own enterprise into a company with
share capital
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#77:3:A>
And that also is very interesting to know there is no company law
in China
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#78:3:A>
So if a <.> com </.> if a state own enterprise convert into for
example another joint venture then the new company will be governed by the
joint venture <?> rule </?> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#79:3:A>
And also each enterprise will have a different memorandum and
article of association which is the law or say the company law for that
particular company
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#80:3:A>
So to uh to be <?> shortly </?> all state enterprises when they
change into a company with share capital that means their own or its own
memorandum will be a memorandum article of association will be the law they
should follow </I> 


 <I> 

<$A>  <ICE-HK:S2A-021#81:4:A>
From my point of view certainly they should disclose more
information to the shareholders
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#82:4:A>
But as I said there is no <.> ar </.> no say company law in China
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#83:4:A>
And therefore uh <,> they just follow the existing disclosure
requirements <,,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#84:4:A>
And at the moment there are only two stock exchange in China
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#85:4:A>
One in Shanghai one in ShenZhen
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#86:4:A>
But all their uh listing <?> rules </?> or uh their regulations
used by the two exchanges are provisional <?> rules </?> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#87:4:A>
They are not definite or final
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#88:4:A>
So we  ' re we  ' re in a very difficult position to comment on the
disclosure requirements or any further development
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#89:4:A>
But I believe there must be some changes on the way </I> 


 <I> 

<$A>  <ICE-HK:S2A-021#90:5:A>
Yep
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#91:5:A>
Okay
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#92:5:A>
I think for want of a better word I think privatization is not
the right word
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#93:5:A>
Maybe we should call it <.> corpora </.> corporatization
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#94:5:A>
There  ' s a lot of people using it these days
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#95:5:A>
When a state own enterprise turns into a joint stock company and uh
you we hear a lot more about about this word even in Hong Kong just like
Radio Hong Kong is going to be corporatized and all that sort of uh uh
similar occasions
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#96:5:A>
Now one of the reason why uh state own enterprises want to become
joint stock companies I think one of the main reasons is if they are to be
turned into uh uh a joint venture they will have all the benefits of a joint
venture like the tax holidays and all and and also uh if they are exporting
they get all the all the all their own uhm uh foreign exchange
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#97:5:A>
And and if they are going to be listed and they will get uh uh uh
additional funds from uh from the people in China and if they are gonna be
listed outside of China to be to issue B shares then they will get uh outside
funds as well
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#98:5:A>
Uh one of the uh Charles talk talk about the the lack of uhm
accounting standards and the lack of uh disclosure requirements and he is
absolutely correct
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#99:5:A>
Uh however in the uh listing rules uh issued by both by Shanghai
and ShenZhen they do have specific regulations uh regarding the information
to be contained in in prospectus
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#100:5:A>
And those information required are pretty similar to the ones that
we have in Hong Kong
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#101:5:A>
Uh you may say that they copy from Hong Kong
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#102:5:A>
It may be true but they also have their own uh standards
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#103:5:A>
Uh <,,> as far as <.> a </.> accounting standards are concerned they
still have not issued uh any accounting standards to date and what I gather
is that they were thinking of issuing the first one last December in draft in
draft form
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#104:5:A>
And the World Bank has also funded a project whereby uh the PRC
authorities mainly Ministry of Finance and other uh other local
provincial ministries uh pertaining to the Ministry of Finance are trying to
set up accounting standards
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#105:5:A>
Uh whether or not it will materialize depends on the effort of uh
uh of the Ministry of Finance
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#106:5:A>
But there again the international outcry is that if China wants to
go out for money go out for B shares or even do secondary listings in places
like Hong Kong London or even uhm New York they  ' ll <.> thav </.> they have
to have international standards because outside investors don't know better
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#107:5:A>
They will <.> os </.> they will only know what is required in
their own country
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#108:5:A>
And that  ' s why international accounting standards are so
important as and when China develops </I> 


 <I> 

<$A>  <ICE-HK:S2A-021#109:6:A>
I  ' ll do that
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#110:6:A>
I  ' ll do that
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#111:6:A>
Uh I  ' m an accountant myself
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#112:6:A>
I  ' m a certified public accountant
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#113:6:A>
Now in China accountant is uh it  ' s got a different meaning <,> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#114:6:A>
Uh the profession in China is regulated by the uh <.> cer </.> uh
by the uh rules relating to certified public accountants
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#115:6:A>
And in the rules themselves it sets out the basic qualification i
e you  ' ve got to be a PRC national so no Hong Kong people can be a Chinese
accountant yet
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#116:6:A>
It may happen in nineteen ninety-seven
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#117:6:A>
Uh the other thing is uh a a certified public accountant in
China has to be with a firm <.> an </.> 
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#118:6:A>
When you leave a firm and you will automatically lose your accounting
status as an accountant
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#119:6:A>
And there  ' s been a lot of discussion <.> re </.> lately in China
about what should a certified public accountant be if if he does choose to
leave a firm
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#120:6:A>
Whereas in Hong Kong if you are a certified public accountant and
if you pass the exams and even if you are not in the profession you are still
an accountant
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#121:6:A>
Now in China uh this may not be the case
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#122:6:A>
If you don't practice you cannot call yourself a certified public
accountant and you cannot get the accreditation calling yourself an
accountant a a CPA in in that respect
 <ICE-HK:S2A-021#123:6:A>
But in Hong Kong uh you can still call yourself an accountant you
may not be a CPA <,> i e you don't hold a <?> practice </?> certificate
 </I>
