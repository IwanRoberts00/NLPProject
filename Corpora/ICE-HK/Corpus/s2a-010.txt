Welcome ATV viewers to Trackside

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#2:1:A>
this Wednesday evening we are at Sha Tin and it  ' s a bit blustery
too <,> but let  ' s go straight into the live action with race two <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-010#3:1:B>
Well for the second event the Sicuan Handicap and three point
seven for Jamieson <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#4:1:B>
forty nine dollars for number nine Universal Glory though <,> as the
last couple are to move up <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#5:1:B>
Legend  ' s Glory has dropped a point and now an extra half point in
the next few seconds seven point six his dividend <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#6:1:B>
That  ' s number eight Legend  ' s Glory so he  ' s supported for Shane
Dye <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#7:1:B>
Super Elite I noticed dropped five points on the board as well and
he  ' s now down to thirty to one <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#8:1:B>
Kristofferson comes in <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#9:1:B>
they  ' re all in <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#10:1:B>
We  ' re set to go <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#11:1:B>
oh <,> this horse has got his head underneath Magic Of Money <,>
and came back <,,> in stall number five

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#12:1:B>
he put his head down and got halfway under <,> well halfway his
neck anyway <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#13:1:B>
and at that point they  ' re normally gone but he was smart enough to
think no I  ' m going to get trapped here I better come back <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#14:1:B>
you don't see that one very often <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#15:1:B>
keep an eye on stall eight as well Heart  ' s Desire he got a bit
restless last time he raced so <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#16:1:B>
he  ' s going to be uh a bit bored with this all going on <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#17:1:B>
well they  ' ll have to back him out which they  ' re doing <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#18:1:B>
Magic Of Money number seven he dropped also at a very big price at
the big board he was four hundred and twenty dollars a little while ago he  ' s
now three hundred and thirty <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#19:1:B>
so they  ' ll trot him around and check that he  ' s okay but that we  ' ll
have a look at later but that was a bit of a freak one because his head went
down just as they were getting ready to jump <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#20:1:B>
and he took a big dive under the gates and he got his neck half way
under <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#21:1:B>
and then he thought no this is not the way I  ' m meant to do it so
he brought it back <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#22:1:B>
Now the front of the gate everything seems to be uhm okay although
they are having a good look at it aren't they <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#23:1:B>
although they  ' re probably watching the horse come back through the
stalls <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#24:1:B>
let  ' s have a look at this one again the green flag is up he  ' s
okay Magic Of Money so he  ' s been passed okay to run <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#25:1:B>
On the big board sixty seven Luck And Fortune continues to trick it
out fifty two bravo victory <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#26:1:B>
three point nine Jamieson <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#27:1:B>
seven point three number eight Legend  ' s Glory down even further so
he  ' s well bet and Universal Glory is forty five dollars <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#28:1:B>
so they  ' ve both been very well bet <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#29:1:B>
Now what  ' s happening here <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#30:1:B>
you know what <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#31:1:B>
this barrier stall <,> when I was talking about it it looked as
though it was bent a little bit <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#32:1:B>
maybe they  ' re not able to use that barrier stall <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#33:1:B>
and these horses as you can see are being backed out of the
barriers but the ones drawn the inside <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#34:1:B>
are remaining at this point locked up <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#35:1:B>
now as you can assume I  ' m simply guessing it at the moment because
we  ' re not in contact with the starters <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#36:1:B>
but it does seem that all of those horses from that barrier stall
of five are coming out and it is and <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#37:1:B>
I wouldn't be surprised if they are all moving out one slot <,>
because the horses in stalls one to four are remaining put <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#38:1:B>
So <,> Magic Of Money <,> an offender <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#39:1:B>
if you are just turning on the screens and wondering what  ' s going
on sitting at home with your dinner or a cup of coffee or whatever <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#40:1:B>
Magic Of Money put in a bit of a freak one and he put his nose down
underneath the stalls <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#41:1:B>
and uh he  ' s caused this problem one would suggest <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#42:1:B>
Thirty nine dollars is Jamieson number five he  ' s the favourite <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#43:1:B>
we  ' ll run down the big board for you <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#44:1:B>
Kristofferson fifty one on the big board Bon Bon at twelve <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#45:1:B>
Luck And Fortune out to six point nine Bravo Victory at five point
four trickling out <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#46:1:B>
Jamieson steady at three point nine and favourite <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#47:1:B>
one hundred plus Hearts Desire <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#48:1:B>
now here we go here  ' s this replay see <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#49:1:B>
in fact he gets himself that far under that he  ' s stuck <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#50:1:B>
he gets caught by the top of his whither of his pommel <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#51:1:B>
and he couldn't go any further <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#52:1:B>
hope you weren't blinking <,> ha ha <,> because it all happened
fairly quickly <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#53:1:B>
but as you can see Magic Of Money in those lime colours is now
locked back up and he  ' s in stall number six <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#54:1:B>
so barrier number five is not working due to the efforts of Magic
Of Money as we just saw a second ago <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#55:1:B>
and these horses are being loaded up from the outside gates and uh
yeah you can see when the attendants out there there  ' s a pretty big bend in
those stalls isn't there at the front <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#56:1:B>
so this one Hearts Desire who was a bit timid about it last time
comes in <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#57:1:B>
Universal Glory stands up pretty well <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#58:1:B>
Glasgow Kiss is in Star of Wah Yan  ' s loaded away <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#59:1:B>
Kristofferson comes forward <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#60:1:B>
as we were saying the nine horse Universal Glory is four point
seven the eight horse Legend  ' s Glory seven point five <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#61:1:B>
With only a couple to move in number ten at seven eleven he  ' s at
thirty four to one number twelve at seventy four to one the thirteen  ' s at
nine to one and fourteen  ' s close enough to fifty to one that it doesn't
matter <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#62:1:B>
you  ' re only missing a point of that <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#63:1:B>
Crowd jeering a bit as the last one comes up again <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#64:1:B>
all set <,> and they  ' re racing <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#65:1:B>
Jamieson dwelt at the start immediately eased out at the go from
the uh wider gate Legend  ' s Glory otherwise New Century  ' s running hard <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#66:1:B>
Magic Of Money had begun well but Speedy Champion leads Magic Of
Money <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#67:1:B>
Bravo Victory kicks up right up behind the speed <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#68:1:B>

rattling on now Luck And Fortune he  ' s trying hard battling away
from New Century <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#89:1:B>
but Speedy Champion had been able to hold a length and a half break
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#90:1:B>
he  ' s starting to get weary <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#91:1:B>
Bravo Victory at the one fifty setting out after him again <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#92:1:B>

<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#97:1:B>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#111:1:B>
but I  ' ve got to say to the naked eye watching it live I thought
four may have held on they hit it <,> and <,> very close maybe right <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-010#112:1:B>
four might have got it from the gate but it  ' s very close to a
