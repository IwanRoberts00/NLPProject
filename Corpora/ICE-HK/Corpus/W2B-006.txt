English dictation is what school children dread most .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#5:1>
Parents loathe it too .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#6:1>
I have a friend who often weeps together with her son over the
dictation he is preparing for the next day . It is an impossible task .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#7:1>
It is useless , too .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#8:1>
Children hate English from the first month in Primary One onwards
because of it .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#9:1>
This could be a root cause of the low English standard in Hong Kong ,
especially among children from poorer backgrounds , despite eight English
lessons per week for 11 years . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#10:1>
Dictation is conducted once a week in an average primary school .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#11:1>
Children must remember the spelling of words from two to six pages of
a textbook .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#12:1>
The teacher reads out about 10 sentences , repeating them once or
twice .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#13:1>
The children write them down .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#14:1>
Five marks are deducted for every wrong word .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#15:1>
You get zero for 20 mistakes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#16:1>
There is little teaching of dictation or spelling .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#17:1>
Parents make 80 per cent of the effort in helping children , the
school barely 20 per cent .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#18:1>
Little phonetic sense is taught by parents or schools .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#19:1>
Most children get by through rote memorisation of what are to them
just random letters .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#20:1>
The less educated the parents , the more hopeless the chore . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#21:1>
Hong Kong children are forced to learn three things
simultaneously for every new word: the pronunciation , the meaning &obrack;  and
associated usage and grammar &cbrack; , and the writing system . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#22:1>
British and American children already speak the language when
they come to spell the words .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#23:1>
Spanish , Vietnamese , Russian , Korean or Arabic children are
familiar with a phonetic writing system of their native language by the time
they have to spell English words . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#24:1>
Children on the mainland and in Taiwan are taught an auxiliary
phonetic writing system for Chinese in lower primary school .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#25:1>
They have at least a clue as to why those few English letters make up
that English sound . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#26:1>
Only Hong Kong children must learn English pronunciation , its
meaning and , in the form of dictation , English spelling without any
knowledge of phonetics . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#27:1>
Chinese dictation is far more humane .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#28:1>
There are only the strokes and the shapes to remember , not
pronunciation and meaning , most of which they already know .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#29:1>
English spelling is taught the way it is because this is what
literacy has meant for thousands of years in China - to recognise the written
word .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#30:1>
Without being conscious of it , Hong Kong schools and parents apply
the principle of remembering the strokes to English .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#31:1>
Letters are nothing more than <it> gweilo </it> strokes that form
<it> gweilo </it> words . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#32:1>
Dictation is just one manifestation of the problem .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#33:1>
Pronunciation of the written word is another scourge .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#34:1>
Many children , if they read English at all , can read only silently .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#35:1>
Many children cannot read a passage aloud properly even though they
can comprehend some of its meaning .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#36:1>
These children will never speak the language , even if they pass the
Certificate of Education exam . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#37:1>
No one takes responsibility .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#38:1>
The English teaching establishment does not see this problem the way
I do , probably because they haven't read about it in the huge , mostly
foreign , literature on English-language teaching . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#39:1>
The Education Department is absolved since it has already given
advice to schools to emphasise reading , listening and speaking in lower
primary school .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#40:1>
It is the schools ' fault not to have realised that they may cut down
dictation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#41:1>
Schools , as usual , put parents ' misconceptions on education
above their own professional judgement since intake quality is far more
important than teaching quality .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#42:1>
Therefore , if parents think literacy means remembering the <it>
gweilo </it> strokes , dictation must not be cut . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#43:1>
The technical solution is to cut English &obrack;  and Chinese &cbrack; dictation
altogether in Primary One , and perhaps Primary Two .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#44:1>
Then decide on a consistent phonetic spelling system for Cantonese ,
train the teachers , and teach the children . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#45:1>
Let Hong Kong children enjoy reading Chinese children  ' s books
like their counterparts in the mainland and Taiwan , where every character ,
though unfamiliar , can be read aloud in their own tongue from the phonetic
symbols beside it . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#46:1>
Let them start creative writing at six , and put in the phonetic
version when they have not mastered a character yet .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#47:1>
Then , like Spanish children , let them start spelling English words
only after they can spell every classmate  ' s name in English . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#48:1>
This approach is better than simply teaching phonics , which does
not solve the problem of learning three things at once .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#49:1>
But the technical solution is not the whole solution .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#50:1>
What we lack most is the resolve to change . </p>

<bold> Scene set for real recovery </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#53:2>
<bold> After years of being put in the shade of piracy and dwindling
cinema audiences , Hong Kong  ' s film industry is savouring a revival and
Oscar glory .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#54:2>
<it> Ella Lee </it> reports </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#55:2>
<bold> WHEN THE MAKERS </bold> of hit movie <it> Crouching Tiger
, Hidden Dragon </it> attend the star-studded presentation of the Oscars in
Los Angeles next month , they will provide Hong Kong  ' s film industry with a
much-needed boost . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#56:2>
The martial-arts epic , featuring key contributions from talented
members of the SAR  ' s movie world , was nominated for a record 10 Oscars on
Tuesday , including best film , best foreign film and best director . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#57:2>
Chow Yun-fat , the megastar actor from Lamma Island , plays a
master swordsman who falls in love with a character played by Michelle Yeoh ,
who rose to stardom in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#58:2>
Yuen Woo-ping , a local veteran martial-arts choreographer , is the
film  ' s stunt director . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#59:2>
The Taiwanese movie  ' s success is warmly welcomed by film-makers
in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#60:2>
But it is the long queues outside local cinemas - to see this film
and other blockbusters - which provide the most tangible evidence of a
revival in the industry  ' s fortunes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#61:2>
Only two or three years ago , gloom surrounded the local film
industry as it plunged into a &ldquo; dark age &rdquo; prompted largely by
the economic downturn and copyright piracy .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#62:2>
Cinemas at that time were virtually empty , as many people ditched
the idea of paying &dollar;50 or more for a seat and opted for home
entertainment , sometimes viewing pirated video compact discs costing only
&dollar;20 each . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#63:2>
The number of local films screened in Hong Kong dropped to only
94 and 92 in 1997 and 1998 respectively , compared with about 200 annually in
the early 1990s .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#64:2>
Local films represented only half of all those shown in the SAR .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#65:2>
It was a far cry from the boom of the 1980s , when Hong Kong films
constituted 80 per cent of the local film market . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#66:2>
Now , after enduring the slump , things are at last looking up .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#67:2>
The Hong Kong movie is back . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#68:2>
The number of films produced locally , and cinema attendances in
general , are on the rise .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#69:2>
The number of local films screened rose to 150 last year and
generated box office receipts of &dollar;383 million . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#70:2>
&ldquo; We now have a rebound , although it still a long way from
a full recovery , &rdquo; says Woody Tsung Wan-chi , chief executive of the
Hong Kong Motion Picture Industry Association . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#71:2>
Although box-office figures for local films remain more or less
the same , Mr Tsung says the number of people going to watch them is on the
increase .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#72:2>
This is not reflected in the box-office receipts because cinemas are
offering discounted seats for some screenings . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#73:2>
Buoyed by the optimistic atmosphere , movers and shakers in the
industry are calling on the Government to do more to encourage new talent and
small investors .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#74:2>
Their calls are backed by academics . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#75:2>
Hong Kong ranks first in the world in terms of film production
per capita .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#76:2>
But piracy and the poor quality of many local films almost killed the
industry .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#77:2>
In March 1999 , 2,000 people from the local film industry , including
superstars as Jackie Chan , took to the streets to campaign the government
for action on piracy .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#78:2>
Many local cinemas closed as part of the protest . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#79:2>
But Mr Tsung says the industry is now benefiting from an increase
in demand for local movies , partly fuelled by specialist Web sites .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#80:2>
This has generated handsome revenues for film-makers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#81:2>
&ldquo; With the new money , film companies can pay more for good-
quality scripts .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#82:2>
The atmosphere is getting better .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#83:2>
More people are willing to try out new ideas to attract an audience .
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#84:2>
He says the Asian financial crisis hit the industry badly .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#85:2>
&ldquo; Two or three years ago , people had no money for movies .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#86:2>
The unemployment rate &obrack;  in the local film industry &cbrack; reached 70 per
cent at one point .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#87:2>
Many people I know were forced to leave the profession . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#88:2>
&ldquo; Some stunt men became taxi drivers or painters and
decorators while some artists have found jobs in newspapers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#89:2>
Of course , we admit that the bad quality of some local films was
also a factor leading to the downturn . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#90:2>
The unemployment rate in the industry has since dropped .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#91:2>
Government figures show the number of people working in the field
increased slightly , from 5,129 in 1998 to 5,248 in 1999 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#92:2>
The value of domestic exports of videotapes and discs rose , from
&dollar;234 million to &dollar;541 million , during the same period . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#93:2>
Mr Tsung says the crisis has its positive side .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#94:2>
It has motivated film-makers into rethinking their strategy and
finding the momentum to survive . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#95:2>
For example , first-time director Fruit Chan's <it> Made in Hong
Kong </it> , screened in 1997 , was a landmark movie that took advantage of
the critical slump period . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#96:2>
As a low-cost production , the &dollar;600,000 film was given a
rare chance to be screened in local theatres , previously dominated by
multi-million dollar blockbusters with superstar casts . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#97:2>
Featuring unknown actors , the movie was named the Best Film and
Chan the Best Director at the 17th Hong Kong Film Awards in 1998 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#98:2>
One of the actors , Sam Lee Chan-sam was named Best Newcomer for his
role as a troubled young man drawn into a triad society . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#99:2>
Recently , more local directors and actors have made their names
internationally .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#100:2>
Tony Leung Chiu-wai won the best-actor award at the Cannes Film
Festival in France last May . Leung , the first Hong Kong actor to win the
award , was honoured for his role as a cheating and cheated husband in <it>
In the Mood for Love </it> , directed by Wong Kar-wai . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#101:2>
But according to Mr Tsung - whose association has more than 160
companies as members - more need to be done to help the industry .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#102:2>
The association has been fighting for more support from the
Government . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#103:2>
The Government recently adopted a proposal by the film companies
to conduct a survey to establish the tastes of Hong Kong cinema-goers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#104:2>
&ldquo; We see how other governments , such as Korea and Canada
, have done a lot to help the film industry , &rdquo; says Mr Tsung .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#105:2>
&ldquo; But in Hong Kong , government efforts are rather piecemeal .
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#106:2>
To answer the repeated calls for help , the SAR Government set
up the Film Services Office in April 1998 under the Television and
Entertainment Licensing Authority .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#107:2>
The new office is the first government unit to provide a one-stop
service for the industry , ranging from arranging venues for filming ,
regulating the use of special effects such as explosives , and providing more
information for those involved in the industry . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#108:2>
A &dollar;100 million Film Development Fund was established in
1999 as part of Tung Chee-hwa  ' s commitment to boost the industry .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#109:2>
The fund has so far allocated &dollar;23.5 million to 15 projects ,
including training courses for directors and technicians , and sponsorship
for young script writers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#110:2>
The authority  ' s assistant commissioner , Helen Tang says the
office has helped film-makers overcome hurdles in renting venues for film
crews working in busy public areas .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#111:2>
The office negotiated with the Government last year to successfully
reduce fees for filming along the Mid-Levels escalator from more than
&dollar;12,000 to about &dollar;4,000 for the first four hours .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#112:2>
It also helped win approval last year for film-makers to use parts
of the airport and Hunghom railway station for scenes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#113:2>
Some 160 government venues and sites owned by public organisations
are now open to rental for film production . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#114:2>
Action-movie hero Jackie Chan has also been involved .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#115:2>
&ldquo; We have convinced Ocean Park to allow Jackie Chan to film
its dolphins for the movie <it> Gorgeous </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#116:2>
He had planned for the worst - had Ocean Park refused , he would
have made the film in Australia , &rdquo; says Ms Tang . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#117:2>
It is not uncommon for some film-makers to avoid red tape and
shoot scenes in busy areas without notifying the authorities . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#118:2>
&ldquo; We have been trying very hard to persuade the related
departments to make a compromise , and with most of them , our efforts work ,
&rdquo; says Ms Tang . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#119:2>
The opening of the Hong Kong Film Archive in Sai Wan Ho last
month was seen as a further boost to the industry .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#120:2>
The archive contains 3,800 films and 85,000 pieces of film heritage
dating back to 1898 and collected over the past eight years . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#121:2>
However , Lo Wai-luk from the Baptist University  ' s Department
of Cinema and Television , believes officials have failed to adopt the right
strategy .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#122:2>
&ldquo; The Government has taken films more as an entertainment and
business rather than as an art .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#123:2>
It keeps pumping money to help big film companies but forgets the
small investors and independent producers . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#124:2>
Dr Lo says the Hong Kong film industry has suffered from &ldquo;
genre shrinking ' , a reference to the narrowing range of movie themes and
ideas .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#125:2>
The market is flooded with action and comedy films and has little
space for independent movies with creative ideas .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#126:2>
He believes the only way to strengthen the industry is to widen the
range of films and cultivate an &ldquo; art audience" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#127:2>
&ldquo; Movies area bout the culture of our society , and Hong
Kong needs to expand the audience .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#128:2>
It could be done through promotion in schools and the community .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#129:2>
If 30 schools screen a movie and each student pays &dollar;10 , this
will provide enough funds for the small investors to keep their productions
running . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#130:2>
He added the Government should help set up a community-based
network so students can learn more about Hong Kong  ' s cinema heritage and
today  ' s film industry . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#131:2>
Dr Lo warns that Hong Kong risks losing its influence if
Hollywood absorbs local talent .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#132:2>
The increasing popularity of local stars and movie-makers has led to
an exodus of top directors and actors . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#133:2>
But Ms Tang rejects criticism that the Government is
shortsighted in its film policy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#134:2>
&ldquo; Regarding the survey on cinema-goers , we are conducting
the study this year .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#135:2>
It does not mean we will not do it again in the future .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#136:2>
The Film Development Fund welcomes all kinds of projects .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#137:2>
Some of them could help the independent and small producers .
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#138:2>
Whatever happened , famous mainland director Zhang Yimou
believes there will always be a place for Chinese films , whether from the
mainland , Hong Kong or Taiwan . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-006#139:2>
&ldquo; Chinese films will never die .

<ICE-HK:W2B-006#140:2>
If you give the people a Western meal every day , they will still
want to have a Chinese meal now and then . &rdquo; </p>
