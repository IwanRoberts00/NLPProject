Good evening <,> today is China  ' s National Day

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X2:1:Z>
And we  ' re going to take a look at relations between the Hong Kong
SAR and China <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X3:1:Z>
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen told Chief Secretary Anson Chan last week
to support Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X4:1:Z>
What does it mean <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X5:1:Z>
Is China unhappy with Anson Chan <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X6:1:Z>
Is Beijing interfering Hong Kong internal affairs

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X7:1:Z>
With us tonight are Doctor James Tang Head of the Politics and
Public Administration Department of the University of Hong Kong and Doctor
Eden Woon Director of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X8:1:Z>
Welcome gentlemen

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X9:1:Z>
James if I may start with you

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X10:1:Z>
What do you think was the message that Vice-Premier Qian was
giving to Anson and to the people of Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X11:1:Z>
Was it just a support uh C H Tung </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-036#12:1:A>
Oh obviously there is a strong message about <,> the
importance of <,> uhm supporting uh the Chief Executive and sort of direction
that he is leading Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#13:1:A>
And uh <,> in in a way of course this is also why the message that
the central government pays close attention to development in Hong Kong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X14:1:Z>
Uhm now Eden do you think it is appropriate for the central
government to tell Hong Kong officials what to do </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-036#15:1:B>
Well I think the in this case uhm the uhm uh coordination
between the uh civil servants uh underneath Tung and Tung uh is the same as
within the other government uh it would hope that the civil servants <,> uh
and the uh leader of the government uh are of uh one mind

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#16:1:B>
So uhm I think this is uh uh not a particularly uh different type
of uh uh statement than uh anyone would give about any other governments uh
around the world

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X17:1:Z>
You don't think it  ' s a a violation of uh One Country Two Systems
for the central government to tell to be telling Hong Kong officials how uh
to behave and what to do </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-036#18:1:B>
Well not I don't think so

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#19:1:B>
I think this case is uh is like apple pie that uh you know if you
work for the government then you work for the men on top

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#20:1:B>
And uh this is true in all governments and so that uh Beijing
obviously is concern about how Hong Kong uh uh is going to uh develop uh and
uh this uh <,> uh whether or not they show evidence uh one way and the other

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#21:1:B>
I think that this particular statement is a statement that uhm I
can't see why anybody will object to

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-036#22:1:A>
It does bring in I think dilemma of this One Country Two
Systems uh arrangement for Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#23:1:A>
Uhm when uhm there is constitutional arrangement for <,> Hong Kong
to take care of its own internal affairs <{1> <[1> yet but </[1> the same
time Hong Kong is part of <,> China as some kind of uh <,> uh uh regional <?>
provisial </?> uh level government even <{2> <[2> though </[2> that has never
really be clearly spell <{3> <[3> out </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#24:1:A>
And uh in the way I think we are really confronting with <,> a very
difficult situation here to what extent and when when there are problems in
Hong Kong than uh would require central government attention

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#25:1:A>
I mean obviously uh on some major issues uh for example over the
financial crisis <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> the central government did indicate that
they would you know <,> uhm support Hong Kong if necessary using financial
resources

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#26:1:A>
So uhm there are cases when that may be legitimate but there  ' re
also other cases when that would create concern among international community
or among people in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#27:1:A>
And in this particular case I think <,> uh we are sort of you know
<,> are going through a quite uh delicate <{5> <[5> sort of </[5> you know
situation

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#28:1:A>
Uhm when depending on how you interpret the situation whether this  ' s
a gentle uh rise in some opinion express which of course you know the central
government officials are <?> entitled </?> too or whether there is more than
that

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#29:1:A>
<{6> <[6> I think </[6> that  ' s the critical <,> <{7> <[7> uh </[7>
test

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X30:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X31:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X32:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X33:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X34:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X35:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X36:1:Z>
<[7> Yes </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X37:1:Z>
So the the line separating the two systems is not a very clear
line it  ' s little <unc> one-word </unc> fuzzy <{1> <[1> periodically
</[1> I I would think that after the central government uh appoint the Chief
Executive and he appoint his principle officials

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X38:1:Z>
Then the central government should then keep its hand off and let
the SAR government run things

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X39:1:Z>
But uh their times when the central government should step in uh
and and uh not necessary interfere but uh help Hong Kong alone what what do
<{2> <[2> you </[2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-036#40:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-036#41:1:B>
<[2> Well </[2> </{2> I think it  ' s oral playing by saying
that this is interference or that there are saying that because there are
views there are some sort of uh conspiracy theory

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#42:1:B>
I think that uhm you know as uh Anson uh Chan herself said he said
uhm you know perhaps in Beijing they are not as familiar with what  ' s
happening down here <{> <[> as people </[> down here

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#43:1:B>
Uh and uh they could uhm you know see that uhm you know there  ' ll
been articles in the newspapers and and uh and so they just want to reform uh
you know support for the <,> uh Mr Tung and uh also for the civil servants
and then uh hope that uh everybody works well together

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X44:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X45:1:Z>
Well actually another thing uh Anson said uh the time was that uh
the leaders in Beijing may not be too aware of what  ' s go on in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X46:1:Z>
And she doesn't know what people from Hong Kong who visit Beijing
are telling them

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X47:1:Z>
Do you think that is a serious uh issue that other Hong Kong
people are going to Beijing and carrying messages to the Chinese leadership
</X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-036#48:1:B>
Well this is a free society people are free to carry messages
every where and uh yeah certain people want to carry messages to Beijing uhm
some people carry messages to other places

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#49:1:B>
<{1> <[1> And uhm </[1> so <{2> <[2> uh I </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X50:1:Z>
<[1> Uh ha </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X51:1:Z>
<[2> If <.> ev </.> </[2> </{2> even of these messages underline
uh <,> I  ' m I  ' m sorry uh erode uh confidence in the Hong Kong government
</X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-036#52:1:B>
I think basically is that uh you know people <?> who </?> can
have their own views <{> <[> and uh </[> it  ' s up to uh the people who are
analysing it uh to figure out uh you know how the balance views but uh I
think that uh this particular comment I think that really uh you know you
should <unc> one-word </unc> it uh as much as uh you know some <?>
analysis </?> have

<$Z> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-036#53:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-036#54:1:A>
I I agree that we should not sort of over play this particular
<{1> <[1> remark </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#55:1:A>
But I think it does <,> uh bring up this sort of you know problems
that we have to confront it there  ' s <,> uhm no proper framework for somehow
communications between uh Hong Kong government <,> and the central government
in Beijing uh under the One Country Two Systems arrangement

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#56:1:A>
Yet at the same time there are people who are influential in
Beijing who are influential in Hong Kong who are also able to have direct
channels uh bringing up issues to the central government

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#57:1:A>
Then uh obviously it would sometimes create tensions and <{2> <[2>
you </[2> know uh misunderstanding even

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X58:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X59:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X60:1:Z>
Yeah there  ' s there  ' s another issue uh the Chinese government has
been making a quite clear that it support uh C H Tung serving a second term

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X61:1:Z>
It  ' s been telling that to <,> uh business uh leaders and another
people

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X62:1:Z>
Now uh isn't this uh some what contradictory uh to the Basic Law
which said said the Chief Executive should be elected by an election
committee

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X63:1:Z>
<?> I mean </?> why should the central govern government <unc>
one-word </unc> the work of the election committee </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-036#64:1:B>
Well the uh the central government is <unc> one-word
</unc> in the uh continuous stability and prosperity of uh of Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#65:1:B>
And I think that uhm you know by enlarge you know you have to admit
that in the last uh you know over three years uhm they have <?> state state
</?> by this principle and really not have uhm uh make uhm you know any
attempts at all on specific uh issues uh to interfere here

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#66:1:B>
And uhm I think that just to say that uh the government are are the
work uh uh with one heart

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#67:1:B>
Uh you know behind Mr Tung uh in my uh opinion <{1> <[1> uh </[1>
he  ' s not a uh interference <{2> <[2> uh </[2> but I agree with James he said
he said that One Country Two Systems uh is a uhm concept <{3> <[3> uh </[3>
which is uh has uhm you know difficulties and uh so that people also
interpret it you know a different way uh because there are lot of grey areas

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#68:1:B>
Uh it  ' s just <{4> <[4> through </[4> that in this particular case
I think that the grey area is is really not that uh not that grey

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X69:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X70:1:Z>
<[2> Right </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X71:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X72:1:Z>
<[4> Right </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X73:1:Z>
Well the point I was making actually was that the central
government seem to be undermining the role of the election committee

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X74:1:Z>
Uh James what do you think </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-036#75:1:A>
Well uhm <,> well to be politically realistic I mean even if
the central government doesn't make any comment I mean they are not really
now trying to <?> sold </?> openly sort of publicize a particular position
even though of course we all sort of you know <{1> <[1> <,> hear </[1> all
the story about how messages would come indicated

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#76:1:A>
But to be politically realistic even if uhm central leaders are not
doing that we all know that anyone who is not supported by the central
government in Beijing <{2> <[2> would be </[2> unlikely to be uh selected in
Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#77:1:A>
So in it this is also sort of the sort of political framework <{3>
<[3> that we </[3> have to live with

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#78:1:A>
But <,> uhm where does that would be seen to be something
undesirable I think it  ' s a different <{4> <[4> issue

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#79:1:A>
To </[4> what extent when we would have really sort of you know
likes central leaders dominating someone or say this is the <{5> <[5> leader
for </[5> Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#80:1:A>
I think there are the sort of a very difficult situation for us
<{6> <[6> but </[6> this is I think the the the something we have to live
with

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#81:1:A>
And may be there are also possibilities and other ways of for
example improving <,> communication and try to uhm not only think of One
Country Two Systems as a concept but also you know in practical term how some
of these issues could be dealt with

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X82:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X83:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X84:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X85:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X86:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X87:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X88:1:Z>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X89:1:Z>
Well on a practical level Eden do you think that uh C H Tung  ' s
position is now stronger that uh he  ' s been boosted uh by uh <,> uh Qian
Qichen saying these things to Anson </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-036#90:1:B>
Well I think Mr Tung  ' s position uhm in terms of uh community
confidence uh is uh largely based on uh how he deals with the issues here
<{1> <[1> uh in </[1> Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#91:1:B>
And I think that uhm you know the confidence in him was a very low
<unc> one-word </unc> uh July uh but they have improve

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#92:1:B>
And it really depends on uh number one the state of economy and I
think the uh the economic uh development uh is perhaps more even now <{2>
<[2> than </[2> worse a few months ago

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#93:1:B>
Uh although the figures was very good uh even a few months ago I
think that there were a lot of unevenness <{3> <[3> uh in </[3> the
development

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#94:1:B>
Uhm so number two I think that he uhm uh you know has shown some uh
you know uh leadership and some uh compassion uh with the uh immigration
officials

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#95:1:B>
Uh for example uhm uh problem uh the uh with the uh right of abode
demonstrators

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#96:1:B>
Uhm you know he show uh compassion uh and it was <unc> one-word
</unc> at the you know at at the scene

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#97:1:B>
Uh so uh I think that uhm uh generally is is rise any rise would be
on how he deals with the Hong Kong matter

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#98:1:B>
I don't think <{4> <[4> is </[4> relating to uh uh what Beijing
says

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X99:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X100:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X101:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X102:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X103:1:Z>
I see

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X104:1:Z>
Uh James I was thinking that uh if C H Tung was a strong leader
he would need Beijing to step in and and tell <,> <?> Anson </?> the civil
servants to get into line and support uh Tung

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X105:1:Z>
Does it show uh he must a weak leader </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-036#106:1:A>
Uh obviously I think that as as far as Beijing  ' s concern I
mean this is an issue in Hong Kong and they need to do something to uhm
somehow uhm mobilize support for him

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#107:1:A>
So I think we situation remain fluid because uh there were people
with very different views

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#108:1:A>
And uh I mean I also agree that and the state of economy would be
important but also I think the <,> how uh Tung could sort of be able to be
seen uh as someone who could mobilize public support <{1> <[1> who </[1>
could be a effective political communicator

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#109:1:A>
I think he  ' s attempting to do some of these now

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#110:1:A>
Uhm so <,> uhm I think this it is <,> uh there there are still
there would be also of different views about this particular issue

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#111:1:A>
But I <{2> <[2> think </[2> how Tung himself <,> deal with the
Hong Kong situation would be critical in eventually <,> giving the signal
even to Beijing whether he is capable of serving us as Chief Executive <{3>
<[3> for Hong Kong </[3>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X112:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X113:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X114:1:Z>
<[3> Alright okay </[3> </{3> we  ' ll continue the discussion
later

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X115:1:Z>
Don't go away we  ' ll right back <&> Commercial break </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X116:1:Z>
Welcome back we  ' re discussing Hong Kong relations with mainland
China

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X117:1:Z>
Eden you  ' re of the General of Commerce uh tell me is Hong Kong
doing a lot of business with the mainland

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X118:1:Z>
How are things doing on that front </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-036#119:1:B>
Well uh the business with uh China is very good and uh it  ' s
no cost the figures about the export uh uh and re-export this year uh have
been tremendous uh <?> our </?> to Europe and United States

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#120:1:B>
And many of those goods are sold in uh in China

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#121:1:B>
And so that uhm in terms of uh uh manufacturing in China and
exporting elsewhere uh that is uh going very well this point

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X122:1:Z>
Well are there things is the business community would like the
Hong Kong government to do to help them uh <,> in increase uh business in
China </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-036#123:1:B>
Well that is a very uh topical question right now because uh
we  ' re looking at China entering the WTO probably in a few months

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#124:1:B>
<{1> <[1> And uh </[1> there  ' s a lot of concern uh among the
business community on uh when that happens when the level uh playing field
and transparency show up

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#125:1:B>
Uh can the Hong Kong businesses especially the <?> SMEs </?>
complete against the uhm <?> multinationals </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#126:1:B>
Uh so they are looking for ways of uh uh knowing more about uh
policy formulation in Beijing

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#127:1:B>
Uh when it would affect them <{2> <[2> uh </[2> they want uh
certain crash hole uhm that uh uh keep them out of China uh be a lord so they
can get in

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#128:1:B>
Uh and of course you know to be fair some of the things that they
are asking for are are not going to be keeping with WTO rules

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#129:1:B>
<{3> <[3> Uh </[3> so they cannot give them <{4> <[4> uh </[4> but
uh on the other hand I think that there  ' s no doubt that better communication
between the Hong Kong government uh and the uh central government uh
especially in trade and business issues uh I think the most of the business
community feels that there is a quite way to uh improve on <{5> <[5> that
front </[5>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X130:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X131:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X132:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X133:1:Z>
<[4> I see </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X134:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X135:1:Z>
Now James on a political side <,> a number of uh Hong Kong
business people uh have been detained on the mainland

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X136:1:Z>
Uh some of them for very long period and I think the number is uh
something like several dozen of them

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X137:1:Z>
Do you think the SAR government is doing <,> uh <,> as much as it
possibly can to help these people </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-036#138:1:A>
I actually think the SAR government could do far more in
terms of not only dealing with some of these very specific problem but to be
able to be bit more effective in getting their views <?> on calls </?> on
very practical issues

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#139:1:A>
Not necessary <,> at the day to day level but also <,> uhm getting
the ideas through learning a bit more about the policies talks in Beijing

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#140:1:A>
It  ' s tricky because we don't want to be seen to be sort of you
know <,> part of one single <{1> <[1> system </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#141:1:A>
Yet I think there are ways of doing it <,> through other <,> sort
of channels more imaginative uh uh ideas of setting up uhm things outside of
the government

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#142:1:A>
But allowing government officials may be business community people
and others to in to interact a little bit

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#143:1:A>
To be able to get this sort of information but yet not be seen as
an instruction of order or some sort of supreme subordinate position

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#144:1:A>
But a chance of you know really informal uh understanding of what  ' s
going on on Beijing side

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#145:1:A>
And and then remember Beijing is now ready a place where there are
completing voices it  ' s a very you know different sort of situation

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#146:1:A>
We are not talking about one single <,> dominant uh central
government <{2> <[2> that </[2> <.> di </.> different people in charge of
sort of <?> democratic </?> uh areas different policies and I think we need
to really be uh better inform about what  ' s going on in Beijing

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X147:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X148:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#149:1:B>
Well I agree with James he said uhm I think that the uhm <,>
uh the uncertainty about uh the One Country Two Systems uh really uh put a
restraint on uhm uh communication between uhm the SAR government officials
<{1> <[1> and and </[1> China

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#150:1:B>
Uh so that uhm uh uh we feel that uh on uh for example on
detention uh cases uh I think that the government is is is very careful uhm
in in dealing with the central government uh or even the provision government
<{2> <[2> uh </[2> on this issue

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#151:1:B>
Uhm now we  ' re not saying that uhm we know exactly what the cases
are

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#152:1:B>
Cases are whether the business people are guilty or not guilty
<{3> <[3> but I </[3> think that uhm you know there is a transparency
problems uh there is a uhm uh you know <unc> one-word </unc> issue
involve here

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#153:1:B>
Uh and I think that the uh Beijing office uh of the SAR government
uh you know may be will to do more

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#154:1:B>
But I think that in general you know there is a not that much
experience and dealing with the uh with the central government uhm you know
from the old days <{4> <[4> uh among </[4> the uhm uh SAR government
officials

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#155:1:B>
And secondly uhm you know it  ' s a uh there are various <unc>
one-word </unc> about this One Country Two Systems and as James said they
don't want to be viewed as a as being too close and and were very concern
about the fact that uh we need to uhm keep our independent image

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#156:1:B>
We need to keep the uh custom territory independent custom
territories status of of Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#157:1:B>
So there  ' s any <?> erroring </?> at all is <?> erroring </?> on
the more conservative side of uhm you know less communication rather than
<{5> <[5> more </[5>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X158:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X159:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X160:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X161:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X162:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-036#X163:1:Z>
Well is the business community concern about these business
people who are detained on the mainland </X> </I>
