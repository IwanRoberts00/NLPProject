<bold> 1. INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#10:1>
In the last decade , considerably researches and academics in the
world drew significant attentions and contributions in the development of
soft switching inverters &obrack;  1,2,3 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#11:1>
Recently , ac drives have been adopted in newly developed EVs in
Japan , Australia , Europe and the United State of America &obrack;  4,5 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#12:1>
Some researchers claimed that these soft switching inverters were
suitable for the power train of EVs .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#13:1>
In this paper , it will focus on the features of published soft
switching inverters , and comparison with tradition hard switching inverters .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#14:1>
Classification of these soft switching inverters with various aspects
will be made .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#15:1>
It helps EVs makers to have a suitable choice for EVs system which
includes vehicle body , electric propulsion , energy storage battery and
energy management .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#16:1>
Development of power electronics for EVs purpose is also one of the
major concerns .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#17:1>
Comparisons of power switches and merits of soft switching inverters
applied to EVs will be given with point grading system .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#18:1>
Finally , study of potential applications of soft switching inverters
to ac drives of EVs will be reported which include propulsion system , power
supply to air-conditioning and power steering . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#19:1>
<bold> 2 . MERITS OF SOFT SWITCHING INVERTER </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#20:1>
AC drivers seem to be dominant in the propulsion system of EVs .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#21:1>
Table 1 shows some as drives for those newly developed EVs in the
world .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#22:1>
Inverters which convert the limited battery energy to ac power for
propulsion system and other accessory become very important .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#23:1>
Conventional hard switching inverters have been widely applied to ac
drives for modern EVs .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#24:1>
However , hard switching inverters have high peak voltage and current
stresses in devices as a result of inductive switching and diode reverse
recovery .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#25:1>
They have higher switching losses and proportionately increase with
frequency .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#26:1>
High <it> dv/dt </it> results in acoustic noise and serious
electromagnetic interference &obrack;  EMI &cbrack; problems which are the major drawbacks of
hard switching inverter technology .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#27:1>
In order to reduce these switching loss and EMI problems , hence
maximizing the efficiency , power density and reliability of inverters in EVs
, special design of power devices and soft switching techniques for inverters
has become one of the major research directions in power electronics . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#28:1>
Soft switching inverters was introduced at the late 1980s .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#29:1>
For a soft switching approach , a snubber circuit is used in parallel
with the self turn-off device to bypass the load current .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#30:1>
The regenerate snubber is more effective than the dissipative snubber .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#31:1>
The resonant inverter came up through improvement of the snubber
circuit .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#32:1>
In short , soft switching means that the voltage and/or current
waveforms of power switches can be shaped by using resonant network with or
without auxiliary switches to attain zero-voltage and/or zero current
conditions at switching instants .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#33:1>
Soft switching inverters have low switching loss , low <it> di/dt
</it> in the device , low output voltage and <it> dv/dt </it> and low EMI ,
they do not require large Safe Operating Area &obrack;  SOA &cbrack; devices , and have
higher efficiency than hard switching inverters .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#34:1>
However , they require additional components to achieve soft
switching operation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#35:1>
Table 2 gives a comparison of hard switching and soft switching
inverters .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#36:1>
In this papers , we highlight features of several zero voltage
switching &obrack;  ZVS &cbrack; inverters possible for EVs applications which include the
two main directions of soft switching inverters: input side approach and load
side approach . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#37:1>
<bold> 3. CLASSIFICATIONS OF SOFT SWITCHING POWER
INVERTERS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#38:1>
The first soft switching inverters was published by D.M . Divan
in 1986 &obrack;  6 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#39:1>
It was called Resonant DC Link &obrack;  RDCL &cbrack; inverter .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#40:1>
It belongs to input aide approach .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#41:1>
Basically , RDCL inverters set the dc link voltage into oscillation
so that zero voltage instants are created periodically for zero voltage
switching &obrack;  ZVS &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#42:1>
Although this soft switching approach can offer potential advantage ,
RDCL circuit results in an increase in circuit complexity and the frequency
spectrum is restricted by the need of using integral pulse density modulation
&obrack; IPDM &cbrack; when compared with a standard hard switching inverter .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#43:1>
In addition , the peak pulsating link voltage of resonant ling
inverters is twice of the dc link voltage in a standard hard switching
inverter .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#44:1>
To reduce this peak voltage and other drawbacks of the first
generation of RDCL inverter , a number of improved topologies had been
published in the last decade .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#45:1>
Almost of them considered a resonant circuit to be placed in-between
the dc input and the inverter , such as quasi-resonant dc link &obrack;  QRDCL &cbrack; , and
clamped resonant dc link &obrack;  CRDCL &cbrack; inverters .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#46:1>
It is defined as input side approach . Recently , another topology
named auxiliary resonant snubber &obrack;  ARS &cbrack; inverter had been proposed which was
different from others .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#47:1>
The resonant circuit was placed in the load side with the inverter
circuit , not in the dc link .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#48:1>
It is defined as load side approach .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#49:1>
Table 3 shows the classification of soft switching inverters by these
definitions of technology .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#50:1>
Actually , these inverters can be re-grouped by operation ,
application and modulation technique . </p> <h> <it>

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#51:1>
3.1 Features of Existing Inverters </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#52:1>
Almost published ZVS soft switching inverters were listed in
Table 3 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#53:1>
Their features and drawbacks are summarized below . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#54:1>
<bold> <it> Resonant DC Link &obrack;  RDCL &cbrack; Inverter &obrack;  6,7 &cbrack; . </it>
</bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#55:1>
It is one of the most promising inverters because of its simplicity ,
but it impresses substantial voltage stresses &obrack;  about 2.5 supply voltage)
across the devices . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#56:1>
<bold> <it> Quasi Resonant DC Link &obrack;  QRDCL &cbrack; Inverter &obrack;  8,9,20 &cbrack; .
</it> </bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#57:1>
Generally , it is a relative simple resonant circuit .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#58:1>
It consists of two switches , an inductor , and a capacitor .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#59:1>
For resonant operation , it requires a large capacitor which can keep
a nearly constant voltage during the resonant cycle .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#60:1>
In addition , it is difficult to keep the voltage near half of input
voltage at all the operational regions and the energy of the resonant circuit
is not zero for the steady state .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#61:1>
It should also include a current initialization circuit and the dc
link voltage is increased up to 2 times of input voltage . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#62:1>
<bold> <it> Serious Resonant DC Link &obrack;  SrRDCL &cbrack; Inverter &obrack; 
11,12,13 &cbrack; . </it> </bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#63:1>
Actually , it is the duality of parallel resonant dc link inverter .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#64:1>
The switching occurs at zero current instants .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#65:1>
However , irregular current peaks appear when the output voltage
changes suddenly , as similar to voltage peak problem of the parallel
resonant inverter , which will be discussed in sub-session 1.1.2 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#66:1>
The difficulty with the series resonant type was solved with a simple
saturable core to limit the current peaks .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#67:1>
A pulse split concept was introduced which make the current control
scheme more complicated .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#68:1>
This kind of inverter was suitable for induction motor drive . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#69:1>
<bold> <it> Parallel Resonant DC Link &obrack;  PRDCL &cbrack; Inverter &obrack; 
14,15,16 &cbrack; . </it> </bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#70:1>
It needs three additional switches for pulse-width-modulation &obrack;  PWM)
operations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#71:1>
Thus , the resonant circuit becomes somewhat complex and its control
is not easy .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#72:1>
Also , commutation losses of the additional switches are serious
problems .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#73:1>
It uses an inductor as a resonant energy storage element , and can
operate without a resonant capacitor .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#74:1>
On the other hand , because the energy needed to null the link
voltage is stored only in an inductor , the peak current of the inductor is
somewhat higher .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#75:1>
During zero link voltage period , this produces a high conduction
loss and prevents a perfect PWM operation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#76:1>
In addition , for PWM operation it needs three additional switches
and two of three switches are turned on under zero current condition .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#77:1>
Thus , this suffers from the switching stresses resulting form the
device parasitic capacitor . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#78:1>
<bold> <it> Synchronized Resonant DC Link &obrack;  SRDCL &cbrack; Inverter &obrack; 
17,18 &cbrack; . </it> </bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#79:1>
It realizes the soft switching PWM with only one additional switch .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#80:1>
However , the peak voltage of the dc link is higher than the supply
voltage &obrack;  about 15 ~ 1.8 supply voltage &cbrack; and this inverter experiences high
conduction losses because the inductor current is not zero during the steady
state .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#81:1>
Moreover , PWM operation is much limited by idle time after every
commutation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#82:1>
<bold> <it> Clamped Resonant DC Link &obrack;  CRDCL &cbrack; Inverter . </it>
</bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#83:1>
It requires a clamped circuit to pull down the dc link voltage as
close as the dc input voltage .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#84:1>
It consists of two main type of clamped circuits , namely actively
clamped and passively clamped resonant dc link inverters . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#85:1>
<bold> <it> Actively Clamped Resonant DC Link &obrack;  ACRDCL &cbrack; Inverter
[ 19 &cbrack; . </it> </bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#86:1>
It is known as one of the most successful topologies with only one
additional devices and covers 1-40kW power range around 20-60 kHz switching
frequency range .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#87:1>
However , it still has a lot of problems such as device voltage
stresses are high as 1.3 - 1.5 of input voltage , high conduction loss in
resonant inductor .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#88:1>
A big obstacle of ACRDCL is that its power range is limited by
subharmonic and discrete pulse modulation &obrack;  DPM &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#89:1>
<bold> <it> Passively Clamped Resonant DC Link &obrack;  PCRDCL &cbrack; Inverter .
</it> </bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#90:1>
It requires passive elements to be a clamped circuit to pull down the
dc link voltage as close as the dc supply voltage . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#91:1>
<bold> <it> Passively Clamped Quasi-Resonant Link &obrack;  PCQRL)
Inverter &obrack;  20,21 &cbrack; . </it> </bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#92:1>
It has advantage of low clamped factor &obrack;  down to 1.1 - 1.3 of input
voltage &cbrack; , simple resonant control , guaranteed zero link voltage condition
and PWM capabilities .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#93:1>
However , the penalties are relatively high device count associated
with auxiliary switched inductor circuit , and the high reverse voltage
requirement for the clamp diode .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#94:1>
It requires a pair of coupled inductors to reduce the number of
additional switches . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#95:1>
<bold> <it> Resonant Transition &obrack;  RT &cbrack; Inverter &obrack;  22 &cbrack; . </it>
</bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#96:1>
It requires many transitions to achieve desired state changes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#97:1>
It also requires clamping devices to prevent over-voltage across the
auxiliary resonant switch during resonant current resetting . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#98:1>
<bold> <it> Auxiliary Resonant Commutated Pole &obrack;  ARCP &cbrack; Inverter &obrack; 
23,24 &cbrack; . </it> </bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#99:1>
It requires a stiff dc link capacitor bank which is center tapped to
accomplish commutation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#100:1>
Although it reduces the current stresses and losses in the devices
and components , it is thought to be not cost effective at below 200kW power
level because of the large number of additional devices &obrack;  6 devices &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#101:1>
<bold> <it> Auxiliary Resonant Snubber &obrack;  ARS &cbrack; Inverter . </it>
</bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#102:1>
It is the one put the auxiliary switches in the load side such that
the power rating of the auxiliary switches are able to be as small as
one-tenth of the main switches .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#103:1>
It consists of two main types: star-configured and delta-configured
auxiliary resonant snubber inverters . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#104:1>
<bold> <it> Star-configured Auxiliary Resonant Snubber &obrack;  SC-ARS)
Inverter &obrack;  25,26 &cbrack; . </it> </bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#105:1>
It is similar to the resonant transition inverter and it requires a
clamping diode or resonant current sensors along with a precise control to
prevent over-voltage across the auxiliary resonant switch . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#106:1>
<bold> <it> Delta-configured Auxiliary Resonant Snubber &obrack; 
DC-ARS &cbrack; Inverter &obrack;  27,28 &cbrack; . </it> </bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#107:1>
It overcomes the drawbacks of the resonant transition inverters and
SC-ARS inverters .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#108:1>
It does not have penalty of floating voltage or over-voltage on the
auxiliary switches .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#109:1>
It does not require any antiparallel fast recovery diodes across the
resonant switches . </p> <h> <it>

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#110:1>
3.2 Operation </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#111:1>
Those published soft switching inverters listed in Table 3 can
be classified according to their operating principles .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#112:1>
Even though they all are claimed that they are in ZVS , it is only
true for the inverter circuit .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#113:1>
For resonant circuit and the additional switches , they are not all
in ZVS and still carry a resonant circuit as high as the load current ,
especially for those topologies with input side approach .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#114:1>
Their power rating of these auxiliary switches are the same as the
switches in inverter circuit .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#115:1>
For inverter circuit , some of them make the dc link voltage to be
zero when switches in inverter circuit take action , it is called link zero
mode , while some make either upper or lower part of the leg to be zero when
switches in inverter take action .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#116:1>
It is called device zero mode .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#117:1>
Table 4 summarized these inverters by their operating principle .
</p> <h> <it>

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#118:1>
3.3 Applications </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#119:1>
Those published ZVS soft switching inverters listed in Table 3
can also be classified according to their applications which are dependent on
their power range , device types and switching frequency .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#120:1>
These result in suitability of EVs applications .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#121:1>
Generally , switching losses would be increased as the switching
frequency increases .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#122:1>
To basic EVs applications , the dc link voltage should be kept as
close as the input voltage .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#123:1>
Table 5 shows the suitability of these inverters for EVs purposes .
</p> <h> <it>

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#124:1>
3.4 Modulation </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#125:1>
Modulation technique is one of the major concerns in the
development of soft switching inverters .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#126:1>
It results in suitabilities of motor types for drive purposes and
production of harmonic contents .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#127:1>
Actually , there are two directions of modulations in soft-switching
inverters .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#128:1>
One is when ZVS occurs at fixed time intervals , while another one
if when ZVS occurs momentarily .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#129:1>
The former one is only suitable for delta and sigma-delta modulation
techniques &obrack;  29 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#130:1>
For well established PWM operation , the switches in inverter
circuit must be operated when it is required .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#131:1>
Table 5 also summarized the modulation techniques associated with
the soft switching inverters . </p> <h> <bold>

4. COMPARSIONS OF SOFT SWITCHING INVERTERS FOR
EVS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#133:1>
According to Tables 4 and 5 , competent soft switching inverters
for EVs purposes will be shortlisted .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#134:1>
Comparison of these soft switching inverters will be made .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#135:1>
Basically , there are a lot of requirement for inverters in the
applications of EVs .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#136:1>
The following sub-sessions will list the requirement and then
comment on the shortlisted inverters , based on their merits and special
features such as power rating , device count , and device type , with point
grading system . </p> <h> <it>

4.1 Special Requirements for EVs </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#138:1>
To be a contender against the conventional internal combustion
engine &obrack;  ICE &cbrack; vehicles , the electric propulsion drive system in EVs must
demonstrate its superiority in the following areas . ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#139:1>
Power Rating .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#140:1>
- High instant power .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#141:1>
- High power density . 

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#142:1>
Torque-Speed Characteristics .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#143:1>
- High torque at low speed for starting and climbing.

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#144:1>
- High speed at low torque for cruising.

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#145:1>
- Wide speed range including constant torque and constant power
regions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#146:1>
- Fast torque response . 

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#147:1>
Efficiency.

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#148:1>
- High efficiency over wide speed and torque ranges , generally
higher than 95&percent; for fill speed and higher than 80&percent; at low
speed . 

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#149:1>
Robustness. 

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#150:1>
Reliability.

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#151:1>
- No failure before the end of the vehicle life . 

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#152:1>
Cost . </p> <h> <it> 4.2 Power Devices for EVs </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#153:1>
An evaluation of power device for electric propulsion is given
in Table 6 in which a grading system is so adapted that each of the device
characteristics is graded from 0 to 5 points .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#154:1>
Although it seems that the IGBT provides the best performance , the
power MOSFET has also been accepted for many electric propulsion systems ,
especially for relatively low power bikes and electric tricycles .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#155:1>
When the MCT becomes commercially available at reasonable cost , it
is likely to be the best . </p> <h> <it> 4.3 Special Requirement of Soft
Switching Inverters for EVs </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#156:1>
An evaluation of the shortlisted soft switching inverters is
also in Table 7 in which the same grading system is so adapted that each of
the inverter characteristics is graded .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#157:1>
There are three main directions for ac drives , namely induction
motor &obrack;  IM &cbrack; , permanent magnet brushless motor &obrack;  PMBM &cbrack; , and switched
reluctance motor &obrack;  SRM &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#158:1>
These inverters are also evaluated for the suitability of these
motor drive systems .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#159:1>
Although it seems that the SC-ARS provides the best overall
performance , DC-ARS can overcome the drawbacks of SC-ARS .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#160:1>
The rest of inverters seem fairly acceptable for EVs applications .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#161:1>
However , its original design of RT is for rectifier , it may not be
mature for commercially EVs market .

5. POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS OF INVERTERS FOR EVS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#164:1>
The advancement of power electronics plays a dominant role to
the development of soft switching inverters .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#165:1>
The competence and rapid development of IGBT , power MOSFET and MCT
tend to be more specific and tailor-made for EVs applications .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#166:1>
This will further reduce the production cost and improve the
efficiency and performance of the inverters .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#167:1>
Moreover , soft switching inverters for EVs have been proved for ac
drive system in EVs which includes following tests . 

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#168:1>
Distortion . 

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#169:1>
Waveform Analysis . 

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#170:1>
Ripple . 

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#171:1>
Output dv/dt . 

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#172:1>

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#173:1>
Furthermore , the power rating of the inverters in EVs also
demonstrates that soft switching techniques is superior than conventional
hard switching one , in terms of conduction loss , switching loss ,
efficiency , EMI and acoustic problems .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#174:1>
Table 8 shows the power rating of inverters for different types of
EVs , namely sedan , light-weighted van , pick-up truck , and commercial
passenger buses .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#175:1>
For these range of power rating , efficiency of soft-switching
inverters is normally higher than hard switching inverters . </p> <h> <bold>

6. SOFT SWITCHING INVERTERS / CONVERTERS FOR EVS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#177:1>
Other than propulsion system in EVs , soft switching inverters
are also suitable for all power conversion in EVs such as accessory power
supply .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#178:1>
Since EVs do not have an alternator , many auxiliary system must
depend on the battery system to supply the necessary power .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#179:1>
For example , air conditioning , power steering and radios are just
some accessories that will have to rely on a converter/inverter to provide
power from a battery system input as high as 200-400 Vdc range .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#180:1>
The following accessory are dependent on high-efficiency converter
inverter . 

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#181:1>
Convert to 0 - 180 Vac for air conditioning compressor . 

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#182:1>
Convert to 24 Vdc for special purpose needs . 

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#183:1>
Convert to 14.25 Vdc for power steering , headlamps , stereo system
, etc . </p> <h> <bold>

7. CONCLUSION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-031#185:1>
A comprehensive study of published soft switching inverters has
been reported .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#186:1>
They have been classified by different characteristics , by topology
, operation and modulation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#187:1>
Some of them are suitable for high power ac drives system such as
EVs application .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#188:1>
A shortlisted inverters are proposed for further consideration to
apply for power train system in future EVs .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#189:1>
They have been graded by special requirement of EVs .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#190:1>
ARS type seems to be outstanding but it cannot adopt well
established PWM technique and apply for IM drive .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#191:1>
The rest of inverters are fairly similar to each other .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#192:1>
So far these cannot demonstrate their ability to high power ac drive
system for EVs .

<ICE-HK:W2A-031#193:1>
Finally , other applications of soft switching in EVs are proposed
for further development . </p>
