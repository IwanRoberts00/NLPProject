<ICE-HK:S1B-057#1:1:A>
Foreign registered passenger ships based in Hong Kong <,> which
proceed on short voyages without calling at another port <,> possess valid
safety certificate issued under the International Convention for the Safety
of Life at Sea <,> SOLAS for short

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#2:1:A>
However we consider that the safety of these ships needs to be
further guaranteed for a number of reasons <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#3:1:A>
First these ships are remote from the control of their flag state
administrations <,> who may not be well-placed to ensure that safety
standards are maintained in accordance with the convention <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#4:1:A>
Secondly such ships in effect operate on a local basis and carry
large numbers of Hong Kong passengers <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#5:1:A>
These passengers naturally look to government to take a positive
role in ensuring their safety <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#6:1:A>
One further complication is that certificates issued under SOLAS are
only valid for international voyages <,> that is voyages from one port to
another

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#7:1:A>
It is doubtful whether such certificates when used in respect of
non-international voyages are valid

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#8:1:A>
This uncertainly is not helped by our existing legislation which
does not distinguish between ships engaged on international and
non-international voyages <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#9:1:A>
The first aim of the bill is to remove these legal uncertainties by
clearly providing the Director of Marine with specific powers to conduct
safety surveys on foreign registered vessels engaged in non-international
voyages from Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#10:1:A>
The second aim of the bill is to empower the Director of Marine to
require the production of certificates or documentary evidence A in the case
of cargo ships under five hundred tons to ensure that they comply with Hong
Kong safety standards applicable <.> shi </.> to ships of such tonnage <,>
and B in the case of cargo ships of five hundred tons or over registered in a
place which is not a party to SOLAS that they comply with equivalent safety
standards before the ships proceed to sea <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#11:1:A>
Under existing legislation such vessels are not required to provide
any evidence of safety <,> before clearing Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#12:1:A>
As a responsible maritime administration we believe we have an
obligation to ensure the safety of such ships in the same way as those to
which SOLAS applies <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#13:1:A>
In practice for some years we have been inspecting administratively
certificates from such ships <,> with the co-operation of their masters

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#14:1:A>
The bill seeks to formalize current practice <O> speech-by-Deputy-President </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-057#15:1:B>
Mr Deputy President <,> some diametrically <.> oppo </.>
opposite views have been expressed on how the government should approach the
development of a comprehensive competition policy <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#16:1:B>
At one end of the spectrum <,> we heard that governmental or
legislative intervention <,> which distorts markets and resources allocation
should not be pursued since it would stifle enterprise and retard economic
growth <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#17:1:B>
At the other end of the spectrum <,> we heard that anti-trust laws
legislation on consumer protection and fair contract laws should be
introduced to give consumers a fair deal <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#18:1:B>
I think it is worth noting that such divided views are all about
what regulatory framework or what means Hong Kong should adopt in order to
enhance competition

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#19:1:B>
But there is no disagreement on the objective or the end which is
to give consumers more protection <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#20:1:B>
Enhancing competition and providing more protection to consumers do
not necessarily have to be at the expense of inhibiting commercial and
business growth <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#21:1:B>
The proof of this may be seen in the telecommunications and public
transport sectors

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#22:1:B>
In respect of the former <,> the government has recently invited
applications for additional local fixed <?> telecom </?> network licences
which are to be issued in competition with that of the Hong Kong Telephone
Company <,> initially to provide data and fax services and then beyond the
expiry of the Telephone Company  ' s franchise over local fixed network voice
telephone in nineteen ninety-five to cover this sector as well <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#23:1:B>
In the area of public transport healthy and regulated competition
is being provided when justified

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#24:1:B>
Thus a new bus franchise for a package of twenty-six routes on Hong
Kong island has recently been awarded to a new operator through competitive
tender <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#25:1:B>
The government will continue to build on these initiatives while
developing a comprehensive competition policy <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#26:1:B>
At this present formative stage we will be considering a whole
range of issues including for example what competition policy is best suited
to our circumstances <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#27:1:B>
We have an open mind on these issues <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#28:1:B>
In the course of our deliberation <,> we will take into account the
views already expressed in this council <,> and any further views that
members will no doubt wish to offer <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#29:1:B>
I wish to assure members that the administration will also consult
other relevant organizations <,> such as the Consumer Council <,> in addition
to the Governor  ' s Business Council <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#30:1:B>
Mr Deputy President <,> I note the concern expressed by some
members that the Governor  ' s Business Council as it as presently constituted
is not geared to the development of a comprehensive competition policy <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#31:1:B>
While I can understand the thinking giving rise to such concern I
believe we need not to be unduly worried since a competitive and equitable
trading environment is important to all businesses big or small <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#32:1:B>
Also we should not underestimate the Governor  ' s ability in
identifying the economic interests of the business sector which may influence
the various views given to him <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#33:1:B>
The Government is gratified by the degree of interest shown by
members in the Governor  ' s Business Council <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#34:1:B>
While many have applauded the Governor  ' s initiative <,> some have
cast doubt on the potential duplication and co-ordination problems with other
advisory bodies

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#35:1:B>
Such worries are more theoretical than real <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#36:1:B>
Insofar as potential duplication is concerned <,> since the
Governor  ' s Business Council is set up to enlarge and enrich the range of
advice available to the Governor it would be wrong to replace any of the
existing advisory bodies or to treat the council as the sole body which the
government consults on business and related matters <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#37:1:B>
Co-ordination amongst various advisory bodies is not a likely
problem <,> since the views of the various advisory bodies are all channelled
to the administration <,> headed by the Governor <,> and since policies are
formulated in the light of the views received <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#38:1:B>
Concern has also been expressed about the composition of the
Governor  ' s Business Council <,> in particular about the absence of
non-business <?> sectoral </?> representatives such as those from the labour
sector and academics

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#39:1:B>
I would like to reassure honourable members on this point <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#40:1:B>
Members are of course aware that there are many advisory bodies
with multi-sector representation already

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#41:1:B>
They provide the administration and the Governor with valuable
advice <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#42:1:B>
They will continue to do so

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#43:1:B>
There is no intention at all to sidestep this existing network of
consultation

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#44:1:B>
The Governor  ' s Business Council will act as an additional source
of expert advice from the business community <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#45:1:B>
The absence of non-business sectors on the council <,> does not
mean that their views are unimportant or will be ignored

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#46:1:B>
Quite the <.> cont </.> quite the reserve <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#47:1:B>
The government will continue to seek the views of these sectors and
consult other advisory bodies when a policy or proposal affects their
specific interest <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#48:1:B>
In reply to the concern express about the lack of representatives
of small businesses on the council <,> I wish to assure members that the
Governor  ' s mind is open on this

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#49:1:B>
There is no reason why the composition and membership of the
council should not evolve over time to reflect changing circumstances and
needs <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#50:1:B>
Turning to the area of our industrial policy <,> some members have
argued that government should develop a more pro-active policy to support
industry and technology development <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#51:1:B>
As the Governor made clear in his policy address <,> the Hong Kong
Government cannot afford to subsidize business or to provide safety nets for
poorly-performing companies <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#52:1:B>
We are committed to allowing the free play of market forces which
has enabled our industries to flourish in the past <,> and to take full
advantage of the opportunities which <.> o </.> which the opening up of China
has presented <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#53:1:B>
That said we are committed to support industry  ' s own efforts to
improve its quality its efficiency and its development and use of technology
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#54:1:B>
We do so through a range of policies and programmes <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#55:1:B>
Some of these are not specific to industry but are crucial to what
manufacturers are seeking to achieve <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#56:1:B>
For example low and stable taxes provide the right climate for
manufacturers considering investment in research and development <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#57:1:B>
High-quality education and training provide the skilled manpower
needed by technology-intensive companies <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#58:1:B>
But in addition to maintaining a favourable <.> cl </.> climate for
business as a whole <,> the government has invested heavily in projects which
are specifically targeted at supporting industrial upgrading <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#59:1:B>
Let me give some examples <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#60:1:B>
We have two industrial estates catering to companies which are able
to bring new or better technologies or products to Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#61:1:B>
Work has started on the development of a third estate at <O> three
Cantonese words </O>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#62:1:B>
The Hong Kong Productivity Council with the staff strength of about
five hundred provide a wide range of services to help manufacturers upgrade
their productivity and technology <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#63:1:B>
Work has started on the construction of a new industrial technology
centre <,> which will house new technology-based businesses

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#64:1:B>
A fund of two hundred million dollars has been allocated for
investment in applied research and development in industry <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#65:1:B>
The Industries the Industry Department inwards investment programme
is designed to attract overseas investors who can bring useful and relevant
technologies to Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#66:1:B>
The fact that we have instituted programmes which are <.> s </.>
specially designed to support industry is a recognition of the importance
which we attach to this vital economic sector <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#67:1:B>
And I would add that our thinking on how and to what extent we
should support industry is by no means static <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#68:1:B>
The Industry and Technology Development Council which was
established earlier this year <,> will advise the government on how the
support we provide can be most effectively channelled <,> and on what
additional resources should be considered

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#69:1:B>
To take just one example <,> the council will be advising on the
need for a science park in Hong Kong <,> in the light of the findings of a
consultancy study now being carried out <O> several-speeches </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-057#70:1:C>
Mr Deputy President <,> a fortnight ago the Governor presented
to this council the agenda for Hong Kong for the next five years <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#71:1:C>
This included clear and firm commitments to invest in our future
<,> through retraining our workforce <,> promoting research and development
in our tertiary education institutions <,> and upgrading the quality of
education in our schools <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#72:1:C>
These commitments have been welcomed by members of this council <,>
and by the community at large <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#73:1:C>
I pledge my best efforts <,> and those of my colleagues in
Education and Manpower Branch <,> and in the departments and agencies within
my programme areas <,> to implement the various initiatives <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#74:1:C>
In the area of education <,> overall recurrent expenditure will
rise by fifteen point eight per cent in real terms between now and nineteen
ninety-six ninety-seven <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#75:1:C>
Coupled with the forecast decline in the student population <,>
this translates into an increase in the average spending per student of
twenty-four per cent <,> or five and a half per cent a year compound <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#76:1:C>
While this may not have satisfied everyone  ' s aspirations <,> the
rate of progress is significant by any standards <,> and certainly no less
than the forecast rate of real economic growth <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#77:1:C>
The increased funding will enable us to improve both quantity and
quality <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#78:1:C>
More places at the tertiary level <,> and more quality in our
schools <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#79:1:C>
The improvements in each of these sectors will benefit the other
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#80:1:C>
Better schools will mean better prepared students for our tertiary
institutions <,> and more tertiary places will bring among other benefits
more and better teachers for our schools <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#81:1:C>
The extent of these improvements is not limited by the amount of
additional funding <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#82:1:C>
Much can be done by better management of our resources <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#83:1:C>
Over the past few years <,> through productivity improvements and
judicious re-ordering of priorities <,> we have been able to re-deploy
substantial resources to fund a number of much-needed new activities <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#84:1:C>
This is how we have managed to press ahead <,> with implementing
some of the improvements recommended in the fourth report of the Education
Commission <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#85:1:C>
The Curriculum Development Institute has been set up <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#86:1:C>
We are on schedule with the development of learning targets and
target-related assessments <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#87:1:C>
And proposals on guidance and counselling services <,> language in
education <,> and enhancement measures for students with special needs are
all being vigorously pursued <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#88:1:C>
The recommendations in ECR five on the teaching profession have
been widely welcomed <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#89:1:C>
We all want a supportive working environment in schools <,> which
allows teachers to give more individual attention to students <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#90:1:C>
We all want high-quality teachers <,> able and motivated to develop
professionally throughout their career <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#91:1:C>
Our plans to provide additional teachers to schools <,> reduce
class sizes <,> and upgrade the preparation and qualifications of our
teaching force will go a long way towards achieving these objectives <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#92:1:C>
They are also designed to augment and maximize the benefits of the
ECR four improvements <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#93:1:C>
We shall continuously look for ways of achieving the greatest
possible impact of the various improvement measures <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#94:1:C>
I am grateful for the suggestion <,> that the improved
teacher-student ratios should be applied differentially at the secondary
level <,> so that schools taking mainly less able students would benefit more
than those taking more able students <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#95:1:C>
I see merit in this approach and will discuss with our advisory
board how it might best be implemented <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#96:1:C>
In a further attempt to maximize the benefits of the improved
teacher-student ratios <,> we shall press ahead with changes in the school
management framework <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#97:1:C>
In nineteen ninety-three we shall set up a committee on home-school
co-operation <,> to encourage more positive contact between teachers and
parents <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#98:1:C>
We shall develop a systematic school-based induction programme for
new teachers <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#99:1:C>
And we shall build on the experience of the first batch of schools
in the School Management Initiative <,> with a view to extending SMI to all
schools <,> as quickly as possible <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-057#100:1:C>
The committee on home-school co-operation <,> will identify how
parents and teachers can more effectively work together <,> to help our young
people achieve personal and intellectual maturity </I>
