Welcome ATV viewers to trackside this Wednesday evening from
Happy Valley racecourse let  ' s get straight into the live action with race
three <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#2:1:A>


<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-011#3:1:B>
We  ' re looking at the paddock parade for this race number three
on the programme we  ' re up to Flowers Pride he  ' s drawn barrier eight he  ' s
drifting out in the betting <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#4:1:B>
he  ' s twenty five to one <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#5:1:B>
he  ' s had a couple of runs this season <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#6:1:B>
is he stripping any fitter for this one Mark <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-011#7:1:A>
Uh to be honest David he  ' s looked uh reasonably good for all
of them uh he is a horse who takes the eye he  ' s uh quite a good looking type
but uh I think my uh assessment of him now would be disappointing he  ' s just
not come on <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#8:1:A>
I thought when he first worked in the blinkers that was just what he
needed to keep his concentration <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#9:1:A>
quite frankly <,> I  ' m disappointed with him <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#10:1:A>
he he looks good from the paddock uh absolutely nothing wrong with
him here <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#11:1:A>
but his performances have been pretty mediocre

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-011#12:1:C>
Yes he hasn't lived up to what he was showing in the trials I
put the pen straight through Flowers Pride and here is the favourite now
Winning Luck uh from barrier five Robbie Fradd aboard him <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#13:1:C>
Robbie  ' s got a pretty good record he almost got him to victory on
his first start this season over the fourteen hundred metres he  ' s a two time
winner here <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#14:1:C>
I just don't know whether this is his race or not he  ' s got the
speed to be on the pace <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#15:1:C>
which will be an advantage but I could find others with stronger
claims <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-011#16:1:A>
Yep uh Winning Luck uh as I say I thought he was a place
chance uh a win proposition uh I  ' d be a little bit wary of <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#17:1:A>
uh from the other side of the paddock he looks absolutely fine when
he gets round to this side we  ' ll tell you what he looks like close up but uh
uh he  ' s certainly isn't a negative from where I am here <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-011#18:1:B>
Yeah well obviously someone  ' s ringing the bells about him
because uh he  ' s run creditably but he  ' s been a bit one paced <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#19:1:B>
I supposed he runs like that all of the time <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#20:1:B>
but uh I I just thought he  ' s going to get a good position <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#21:1:B>
four point one about him kicking the best in the straight <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#22:1:B>
I  ' m a little bit unsure whether that  ' s a realistic price <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#23:1:B>
he  ' s now four point two as we speak <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#24:1:B>
Five Melrose Star this is the horse we are all talking about as
appearing to be a little bit over priced <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#25:1:B>
uh Eddie Lai takes the ride on him <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#26:1:B>
so his regular rider Douglas White has jumped off and the public
have said no way Jose we don't want him either <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#27:1:B>
he  ' s got a good gate he should get a good position midfield and
just needs a bit of luck <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-011#28:1:A>
He looks in great order too absolutely glowing from the
paddock nothing that I can see visibly wrong with this horse <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#29:1:A>
he uh looks very well in himself <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#30:1:A>
he can get fired up some evenings but uh certainly not tonight uh
uh I  ' m very happy with him uh I think this is good value <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-011#31:1:C>
Well his lone success here was over eighteen hundred metres uh
last season it took him a long time to win that first race <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#32:1:C>
he will be drifting back and stay for that one last sprint wide
around the field Melrose Star <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#33:1:C>
it  ' s a merely a matter if uh the race pans out to his satisfaction
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#34:1:C>
Bold Victory not racing well and uh gate number twelve ensures that
he is going to have to do a lot of work if he  ' s going to get into that
forward position <,> where he does do his best racing when right <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-011#35:1:A>
Yes uh just literally walked in to the paddock so uh David
have you got anything to say about him at the moment because I haven't even
seen him <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-011#36:1:B>
Uh he  ' s drawn a wide gate he  ' s going to press forward isn't
he but no not for me <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#37:1:B>
I found it a bit hard to have him from that barrier draw <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#38:1:B>
he  ' s uh drawn twelve he  ' s going to be wide and doing a bit of
work to get over that was the reason I said no about him <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-011#39:1:A>
I think there  ' s uh another reason that you say that uh
performance when he decided he was going to go via the bar at the football
club uh on that first bend it wouldn't exactly encourage you with his gate
here <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#40:1:A>
uh it looks alright from the other side of the paddock again we  ' ll
catch up with him very shortly uh but Fun Manager the horse on screen at the
moment <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#41:1:A>
well <,> I think they  ' re was excuses for him last time excuses
that I don't like to hear <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#42:1:A>
uh he was scoped afterwards and uh there was a certain amount of
blood in his trachea <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#43:1:A>
wasn't deemed to have bled though <,> uh but he looks very light to
me I uh not struck by this horse at all Darren

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-011#44:1:C>
No I think he struck his opportunity earlier this season in
that real weak race where he uh sat outside spectacular win and there was a
neck between them he just hasn't come on since then <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#45:1:C>
there was no depth to that and that was his chance <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#46:1:C>
seventy one fifty <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#47:1:C>
certainly are others that are much better priced and have better
claims and I would arte this one as one of them Qui Vivra Verra <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#48:1:C>
we haven't seen him since the twenty seventh of October but he ran
his usual consistent race when third behind Win mark <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#49:1:C>
he  ' s a two time winner here <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#50:1:C>
he  ' s certainly been a revamped horse as the years have gone on <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#51:1:C>
and I think if he gets across from gate nine <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#52:1:C>
gets a sit behind the speed he  ' s a must for the multiple players
<,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-011#53:1:A>
Yeah Qui Vivra Verra just wonder where he might be in the run
here uh not drawn ideally in nine he normally goes forward uh and sits fairly
prominently <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#54:1:A>
uhm he does look well he  ' s a horse who carries plenty of condition
on him every time he comes in he looks like he could do with one more run but
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#55:1:A>
that  ' s just him in general appearance anyway so no need to be
negative about him uh certainly not the worst from the paddock <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-011#56:1:B>
No I thought he battled well the other day as well it  ' s a
little while since that run but he  ' s got a great chance good price too <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#57:1:B>
nine Mission Possible <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#58:1:B>
uh just wait and see how he goes here <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-011#59:1:A>
Uh don't like him uhh one or two spots around on him uh plenty
light enough uh if he didn't have a couple of spots you  ' d say he looked
quite well actually he  ' s got the old cross nose band on him as well to try
and keep his mouth shut <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#60:1:A>
uh but I  ' m not overly taken by him <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#61:1:A>
obviously when he opens his mouth he  ' s not nice <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-011#62:1:C>
Do they come in your size <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-011#63:1:A>
Oh ho thank you very much <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-011#64:1:C>
Got to say when he was first up in that uh no race he wasn't
in a very good position at the time he missed the start <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#65:1:C>
his trial earlier on this season was very very slow <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#66:1:C>
Watch Me Win has had a number of barrier trials some of them have
them have been okay he goes out at thirty three to one <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#67:1:C>
and here he is off a mark of thirty eight following is four
disappointing runs last term <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-011#68:1:A>
He  ' s quite a striking horse this to see uh Watch Me Win <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#69:1:A>
could do with just strengthening up a fraction there  ' s not a great
deal of him but he looks very fit uh he  ' s been very much on his toes from
the minute he came in here and <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#70:1:A>
uh he  ' s a bright chestnut with a big white nose roll on him you
wouldn't miss him quickly and uh <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#71:1:A>
I don't dislike him quite frankly he may just need to uh strengthen
up a fraction more but he certainly looks fit and well <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-011#72:1:B>
Yeah <?> I expect him tonight on the third line </?> your
deserving to get a big price about him but I think he  ' s improved a lot from
last season Watch Me Win <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#73:1:B>
seen him a couple of times gallop in the morning and a bit
different than when I saw him last year <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#74:1:B>
Noble Boy  ' s five point two it seems that Tony Millard  ' s got this
guy going really well <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#75:1:B>
remember he was an ISH that  ' s quite good on paper but just battled
in his first fourteen runs <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#76:1:B>
I know at the back end of the season he got close but he should
have probably won one of those <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#77:1:B>
is Five point two too short about him <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-011#78:1:A>
Uh yeah I think it is to short about him quite frankly but uh
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#79:1:A>
he  ' s a very strong horse he  ' s been kept out since that uh run
over the thousand metres uh I  ' m happy enough the way he looks in here
doesn't look the worst at all even after his uh little <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#80:1:A>
visit to the barbers uhm he  ' s a strong individual he certainly
looks as if he  ' s very fit in deed <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#81:1:A>
uh I think he  ' s got every chance of placing I wouldn't want to
stand him out as a win bet <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#82:1:A>
I know you  ' re rather keen on him though Darren <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-011#83:1:C>
Well well I  ' ve gotta say if he runs up to that first up over
the thousand metres <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#84:1:C>
and if he runs up to the trials he  ' s been turning in <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#85:1:C>
I think he deserves this quote of four point nine I think he  ' ll
win the race <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#86:1:C>
uhm I think he has genuinely improved and he was finally getting to
put some decent form together at the back end of the previous season uh for
Laurie Fownes <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#87:1:C>


<ICE-HK:S2A-011#88:1:C>
Magic Win number eleven he  ' s forty eight dollars fifty I think he  ' s
got the speed to put himself in an ideal spot here from barrier number six he
has won here in the past and Douglas White aboard him tonight <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-011#89:1:A>
Looks perfectly okay uh can't see any negatives with this uh
gray horse Magic Win <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#90:1:A>
uh he  ' s never really a particularly eye catching type because of
the way he  ' s been thrown together he just doesn't to uh to be particularly
good physically <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#91:1:A>
but uh he  ' s a very consistent sort of horse <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#92:1:A>
uh I just couldn't have him as a win proposition here he  ' s just
one of many with a chance <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-011#93:1:B>
Yeah I like the way he went in his sprint race first up that  ' s
normally not his go to be that competitive in the grade he took on <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#94:1:B>
over that distance and uh as we saw last time over the four race he
was going to be in front quite comfortably well he was actually <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#95:1:B>
Tweet twenty to one <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#96:1:B>
hard to run with a name like that I  ' d be thinking <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-011#97:1:A>
Yeah I don't think uh he  ' s going to be seen at his best
either here at Happy Valley for me this horse has got a bit of size and scope
about him he  ' d be much better off uh at Sha Tin <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#98:1:A>
and so it  ' s proved on his previous visits to here at the city
track he  ' s never looked <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#99:1:A>
like a horse who  ' s going to unwind quickly enough to make his
presence felt at the business end of a race <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#100:1:A>
umm he is he  ' s definitely doing better now physically but he  ' s
getting fairly warm he  ' s got a big thick winter coat on him and uh fails
really to take the eye still <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#101:1:A>
and incidentally Bold Victory getting very warm indeed I don't
think that  ' s a good sign with him <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-011#102:1:A>
and so is Fun Manager he  ' s got quite a sweat on now <,> </I>
