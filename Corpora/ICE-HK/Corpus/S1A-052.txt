<[5> <unc> multiple words </unc> </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X162:1:Z>
You need to have a <,> proper check up before they can treat you

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-052#163:1:A>
But you know it  ' s <,> uh it  ' s difficult to say but I don't

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X164:1:Z>
<[> Why </[> </{> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-052#165:1:A>
I don't know but you know <,> uh one doctor will say

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X170:1:Z>
You go to a family doctor and your family doctor advises this you
can always uh ask <,> the doctor to uh recommend you to see a specialist or
you know <,> if he is not able

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X171:1:Z>
Sometimes family doctors are just GP and they they they you have
a special problem then they refer you to a specialist </X>

<$A>

You have lived a long time with your mother is <{2> <[2> that

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X259:1:Z>
So you don't have very much contact with your father

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X260:1:Z>
Inside you you have a little bit of <,> link

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X261:1:Z>
You want to love him but you don't know <{3> <[3> how </[3>
because he has no relationship right </X>

</[1> sufficiency <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#266:1:A>
And I feel <,> my mother  ' s love <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> towards me
<{4> <[4> <,> </[4> so I cried just for <,> thanksgiving

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X267:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X268:1:Z>
<[2> Right </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X270:1:Z>
<[4> Yeah </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X274:1:Z>
That  ' s good uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-052#275:1:A>
So

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X276:1:Z>
Is she responding </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-052#277:1:A>
I don't know

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#278:1:A>
I haven't done this uh step yet but sometimes I will

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X279:1:Z>
It  ' s not easy to uh witness to your own <,> people </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-052#280:1:A>
I know

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X281:1:Z>
Sometimes it takes a long long time </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-052#282:1:A>
What is your suggestion

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X283:1:Z>
Patience and prayer </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-052#284:1:A>

We try our best you know <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X288:1:Z>
And sometimes it takes many many years

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X289:1:Z>
Perhaps not worried if you don't see this up <,> quickly you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X290:1:Z>
But just be patient because God in his own time will work
something out

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X291:1:Z>
And in God  ' s economy <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> nothing is wasted <{3>
<[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X292:1:Z>
It  ' s very <{4> <[4> useful </[4> you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X293:1:Z>
You might think that it  ' s not working

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X294:1:Z>
Nobody and your parent your mother and your grandmama might not
be responding at the time this time now but you never know

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X295:1:Z>
You have sown some seeds and some day that seed will start to

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#368:1:A>
Uh <,> you can say that <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#369:1:A>
But <,> it  ' s not easy to get <,> a position in the government  ' s
department <,> because the competition is very keen

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X370:1:Z>
Is it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-052#371:1:A>
Yes <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#372:1:A>
I think is <,> <.> s </.> five or six thousand people <,> had <.>
ap </.> applied these posts <,> so the competition is very keen

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X373:1:Z>
Right

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X374:1:Z>
Do you have to go for a special training </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-052#375:1:A>
I don't know

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#376:1:A>
Different different departments will have different arrangements

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X377:1:Z>
So what is the criteria </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-052#378:1:A>
Ah the criteria

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#379:1:A>
Uhm it  ' s <.> de </.> it depends on <,> what posts that you want
to apply

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#380:1:A>
For example the

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X381:1:Z>
Second one you are applying to

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X382:1:Z>
What is <{> <[> the criteria </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-052#383:1:A>
<[> I have applied </[> </{> to four posts

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#384:1:A>

Executive Officer Assistant Trade Officer <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>
Administration Officer <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> and Labour Officer

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#386:1:A>
The criteria is <,> a degree-holder

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X387:1:Z>
<[1> Four posts </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X388:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X389:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X390:1:Z>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X391:1:Z>
Experience </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-052#392:1:A>
Uh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X393:1:Z>
Because sometimes if you want a an executive job <,> you have to
work your way up <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X394:1:Z>
<{> <[> You </[> need some experience </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-052#395:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#396:1:A>
Uh <,> I don't know <{> <[> <,> because </[> we uhm many of <,>
many of us

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X397:1:Z>
<[> You don't know </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X398:1:Z>
You don't go straight <,> well you know from straight from the
university to be an executive </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-052#399:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X400:1:Z>
You have to work your way up <,> in the <?> government </?>
office like that you know </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-052#401:1:A>
So

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X402:1:Z>
So maybe the the first few years it might be a little difficult
<{> <[> <,> </[> but you learn <,> <unc> multiple words </unc> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-052#403:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#404:1:A>
And I want to <.> st </.> to further my study

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X405:1:Z>
Yeah that  ' s good </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-052#406:1:A>
But not

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#407:1:A>
I  ' m I  ' m thinking about that I <?> didn't </?> want <{1> <[1> I
want </[1> I <,> do <{2> <[2> not </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X408:1:Z>
<[1> <unc> three words </unc> </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X409:1:Z>
<[2> Think </[2> </{2> you want to go straight into <,> <{1> <[1>
study </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X410:1:Z>
Yeah go to study straight away instead of stopping <{2> <[2> and
what </[2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-052#411:1:A>
<[1> Master </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#412:1:A>
<[2> I have </[2> </{2> I have <,> thought about that this uh
planning <{> <[> <,> </[> but

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X413:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X414:1:Z>
You want a break </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-052#415:1:A>
Not a break but <,> does it <,> the subject that you want to
study English or Chinese even you choose English or Chinese what course that
you want to specialize <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#416:1:A>
It  ' s difficult to <,> to choose <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and difficult
to choose a <,> good supervisor <,> to work with uhm to work with <{3> <[3>
<,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#417:1:A>
And the other thing is <,> if <,> you do not plan to do the doctor
degree <,> it  ' s a waste <,> for doing a Master <,> degree

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X418:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X419:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X420:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X421:1:Z>
I don't think so

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X422:1:Z>
You can do a Master first and then slowly go for a Doctorate </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-052#423:1:A>
But a great investment a great investment <{> <[> for me you
know </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X424:1:Z>
<[> It won't be wasted </[> </{> you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X425:1:Z>
It won't be wasted </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-052#426:1:A>
I know but I want to <,> specialize in special field <{1>
<[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#427:1:A>
For example translation <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> it  ' s my interest <{3>
<[3> <,> </[3> or management <{4> <[4> <,> so I </[4> may I I think I may
take some special course

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X428:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X429:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X430:1:Z>
<[3> Yeah </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X431:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X432:1:Z>
Aw in translation </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-052#433:1:A>
Translation or management <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#434:1:A>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#X435:1:Z>

Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-052#443:1:A>
But I think I am not qualified <,,> because I just uhm study
Chinese and English <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> and translation is another branch of
<,> the uh the department <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#444:1:A>
And the skills is very important <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> so I need to
learn <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> if I want to be a translator <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-052#445:1:A>
