as for the other two he did not know whether they could run away </X>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-068#X59:1:Z>
In Ah Cheung  ' s home I sensed something uh I sensed that there was

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-068#60:1:A>
In any event you deduced from everything that happened before
that day and the thing that happened on back to the day that there was the
day of robbery am I right <O> Cantonese translation and answer </O>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-068#X61:1:Z>
I did not deduce anything from anything </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-068#62:1:A>
Very well

<ICE-HK:S1B-068#63:1:A>
Ms Ng <,> now all you have been shown was a hotel record stating

<ICE-HK:S1B-068#X65:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-068#66:1:A>
Now and yet you were able to tell the jury in no uncertain
terms that the last time that you visited defendant  ' s residence was on the
nineteenth <O> Cantonese translation and answer </O>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-068#X67:1:Z>
Yes </X> <O> Cantonese answer </O>

<$Z2  <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-068#X68:1:Z>
It  ' s a Thursday </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-068#69:1:A>
Because the nineteen was a Thursday and that  ' s why you
decided that it was the nineteenth am I right <O> Cantonese translation and
answer </O>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-068#X70:1:Z>
No </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-068#71:1:A>
Was there any other reason why you were so certain that it was
the nineteenth <O> Cantonese translation and answer </O>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-068#X72:1:Z>
On on the night of the nineteenth when I left the three of them
were talking </X> <O> Cantonese answer and translation </O>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-068#X73:1:Z>
And they were watching a Cantonese movie </X> <O> Cantonese answer
</O>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-068#X74:1:Z>
Which was about a rape

<ICE-HK:S1B-068#X75:1:Z>
However the three of them were all looking at me </X> <O>
Cantonese answer </O>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-068#X76:1:Z>
So I was very frightened </X> <O> Cantonese and answer </O>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-068#X77:1:Z>
And on the nineteenth after the three knives were purchased and
brought there I became even more frightened </X> <O> Cantonese answer </O>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-068#X78:1:Z>
At first my impression of the event on that day was not so deep
but after they had done so I became very uh frightened and was in a panic
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-068#79:1:A>
So because you are in a panic you remember that was a
nineteenth so to speak <O>  ' so to speak ' overlap  ' gam ' -  ' so ' </O> <O>
Cantonese translation and answer </O>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-068#X80:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-068#81:1:A>
And therefore the following day must be the twentieth am I
right <O> Cantonese translation and answer </O>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-068#X82:1:Z>
Uh his phoned call at about twelve thirty woke me up from my sleep
and it was the twentieth </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-068#83:1:A>
So am I right to say that uhm the fact that you remember that
was a nineteenth of November was because you were in a panic on the
nineteenth of November while you were still inside the defendant  ' s residence
<O> Cantonese translation and answer </O>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-068#X84:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-068#85:1:A>
And there had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that
hotel records were shown to you this morning by my learned friend counsel for
the Crown <O> Cantonese translation and answer </O>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-068#X86:1:Z>
Correct </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-068#87:1:A>
Right

<ICE-HK:S1B-068#88:1:A>
And presumably when you were first interviewed by the police on the
sixth of January last year <,> the nineteenth of November that date was still
deeply implanted in your mind am I right <O> Cantonese translation and answer
</O>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-068#X89:1:Z>
Correct </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-068#90:1:A>
And you would know that it was the nineteenth of November that
you were put to fear by three men in the defendant  ' s flat <O> Cantonese
translation and answer </O>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-068#X91:1:Z>
Correct </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-068#92:1:A>
And you will have no difficulty in the recalling that it was a
following day uh which must be the twentieth of November that all these
things about counting of money and dividing of money took place right <O>
Cantonese translation and answer </O>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-068#X93:1:Z>
