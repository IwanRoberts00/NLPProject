Dear LUK PUI MAN ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#2:1>
8-5-90

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-008#3:1>
Hello !

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#4:1>
How are you ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#5:1>
I have been in the U.S. for about 4 weeks , everything is O.K. !

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#6:1>
But I had a very difficult problem to solve :

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#7:1>
What is my major ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#8:1>
You knew that .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#9:1>
Because , if I study &ldquo; Business &rdquo; , it will be very
difficult for me to find a job here .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#10:1>
And there is a lot of students study this subject so makes a large
competition .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#11:1>
But I don't know if I study other subject , for examples ,
Architecture , Medicine , Nursing or Computer Science , are they <-> sutiable
</-> <+> suitable </+> for me , or not .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#12:1>
So I hope you will help me to <-> thing </-> <+> think </+> about it
, please .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#13:1>
But your opinion should be received before 24 August because my
decision and the day for register will be made on that day , so please reply
as quickly as you can . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-008#14:1>
This week Wednesday or Thursday &obrack; I can't remember
&cbrack; will be the day to know the result of the HKCEE .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#15:1>
I know that you are very afraid and worry about it , aren't you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#16:1>
I know nothing can reduce your feeling because it is so important to
you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#17:1>
Take it easy !

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#18:1>
O.K. !

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#19:1>
After knowing your result , tell me , whatever they are good or bad .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#20:1>
But I  ' m not so care about of it . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-008#21:1>
How about your summer job ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#22:1>
Is it interesting or boring ..... ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#23:1>
tell me next time .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#24:1>
I had to go to school for about 1 week , taking the English class
&obrack; ESL &cbrack; ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#25:1>
it  ' s not difficult ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#26:1>
we want to write an essay every day and the grade were very good
&obrack; all <ul> A </ul> &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#27:1>
It  ' s truth .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#28:1>
I  ' m not telling lies .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#29:1>
Really .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#30:1>
I will have my examination on 22 &ampersand; 23 August .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#31:1>
I hope I can get a better result . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-008#32:1>
The class includes 18 students ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#33:1>
most of them are Asian but one of them is came from Denmark ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#34:1>
her name is , Christian .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#35:1>
She is a petty girl and is my best friend .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#36:1>
She teaches me how to speak Danish and I teach <del> es </del> her
how to speak Chinese .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#37:1>
She is 19 and is taller than me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#38:1>
I have a lot of friends here ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#39:1>
is different from H.K.

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#40:1>
I stamp out my hot temper and became more rationally .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#41:1>
Everything is improvisation and watching one  ' s feet . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-008#42:1>
My friends and I went to shopping and had lunch yesterday .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#43:1>
We had pizza for lunch , about &dollar;3 each person .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#44:1>
And went to the Pasadena Plaza for shopping , just like the Ocean
Terminal in H.K. .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#45:1>
The cost price is much higher . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-008#46:1>
My friend , Janson who has a car and always drive me home after
school so that I can save &dollar;1.35 for the bus fees .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#47:1>
But if I go home on foot , it took about 45 mins. ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#48:1>
it  ' s hard work and is too hot .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#49:1>
If I miss the bus I wanted to wait for about 1 hour .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#50:1>
So I think I will better buy a bike if possible .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#51:1>
Because it was too <-> expension </-> <+> expensive </+> , about
&dollar;100 each .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#52:1>
Yesterday , I went to eat Japanese food with my uncle and his family
,

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#53:1>
the taste was good and is much cheaper than in H.K. .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#54:1>
So we always go to eat outside . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-008#55:1>
The educational policy here is complicated .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#56:1>
At first , I could not adopt the sudden changes .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#57:1>
Here , education is so freely , so a lot of regulation was made .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#58:1>
I hope I can adopt it later . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-008#59:1>
I  ' m now living with my uncle , you know .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#60:1>
But is not good ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#61:1>
they aren't dislike me ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#62:1>
is because there is so crowd ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#63:1>
a lot of people living here .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#64:1>
So I am now trying to find the apartment but it  ' s a difficult job .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#65:1>
The rent here &obrack; Pasadena &cbrack; is very high but if I try to
find the apartment far away , it will be very difficult for me to go to
school . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-008#66:1>
Last two week , I went to San Diego to visit my uncle , Danny who
is now living over there .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#67:1>
Did I tell you before at my first letter ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#68:1>
Did you receive it ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#69:1>
Totally , I had sent you two letters &obrack; include this one
&cbrack; , is it right ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#70:1>
I visited 3 places .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#71:1>
Firstly is the Balbon Park where has a lot of museums inside , about
10 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#72:1>
May be !

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#73:1>
But I only visited 3 of them .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#74:1>
Like the Aerospace Museum which has a lot of aeroplanes  '  , models
insides &semi; the History Museum and the Space Museum .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#75:1>
Secondly , was the beach but I can't remember the name of it .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#76:1>
The sea water was very cold .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#77:1>
I thought it was not suitable for swimming but a lot of local people
swam there .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#78:1>
So I just lied on the beach to enjoy the sunlight .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#79:1>
It  ' s very nice ! ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-008#80:1>
Lastly , was the shopping center .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#81:1>
I saw 2 films : Total recall , Quick change .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#82:1>
It showed 6 films inside the cinema ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#83:1>
you can see all the films with just 1 ticket during 1 day .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#84:1>
But I only saw 2 ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#85:1>
the fees was quite cheap , <del> i </del> cost &dollar;3.5 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#86:1>
I felt very enjoyable during this journey ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-008#87:1>
I think I must better stop tapping now because I wanted to have
my dinner .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#88:1>
But remember my name is <ul> TOM </ul> , not Leslie .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#89:1>
O.K. !

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#90:1>
And this was the first time that I write a letter in English , so I
think there will be a lot of mistakes inside for example , <-> grammer </->
<+> grammar </+> , something like that .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#91:1>
Please !

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#92:1>
Forgive Me ! !

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#93:1>
O.K. ! </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#94:1>
Please reply before 24th August , if <del> you are </del> possible !

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#95:1>
Bye !

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#96:1>
Best friend ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#97:1>

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#98:2>
Dear Pui Man ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-008#99:2>
How are you ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#100:2>
I  ' m fine .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#101:2>
Everything is O.K. here .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#102:2>
First of all , thank you for sending me the christmas card .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#103:2>
Nevertheless , I  ' m hard to say sorry here because I didn't send you
one &semi; <-> may be </-> <+> maybe </+> next year .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#104:2>
O.K. .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#105:2>
I promise ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-008#106:2>
How about your exam. ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#107:2>
Is it good ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#108:2>
Tell me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#109:2>
However I think you will get a better result because I know you
study hard all the time , aren't you ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#110:2>
Are you having your Christmas holiday right now ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#111:2>
What are you going to do ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#112:2>
Go to shopping ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#113:2>
I don't think it  ' s a good idea .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#114:2>
Because it is so boring &semi;

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#115:2>
do you think so ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#116:2>
How about me ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#117:2>
I think I will better stay at home <del> one-character </del> .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#118:2>
Why ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#119:2>
Because after our Christmas holiday , will be our final examination

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#120:2>
I want to study a lot during this coming holiday .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#121:2>
I hope I will get a better result .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#122:2>
But right now I just get the &ldquo; B &rdquo; grades for all my
classes ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#123:2>
I wish I can get an &ldquo; A &rdquo; in my final . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-008#124:2>
You are F.6 right now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#125:2>
So which university that you are going to apply , Hong Kong
University ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#126:2>
Or what else ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#127:2>
Tell me , next time .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#128:2>
Are you studying Eng. Lit. right now ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#129:2>
Which book are you studying ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#130:2>
Is it the book named &ldquo; Hamlet &rdquo; ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#131:2>
A lot of my friends here studying this book .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#132:2>
They all said that it is very difficult to study .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#133:2>
Is it ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#134:2>
Last week , I applied the classes for the next semester and I am
going to take Accounting , Business Math , Computer Information System , and
also English .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#135:2>
And the tuition is about U.S.&dollar;1700 ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#136:2>
is it expensive ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#137:2>
I think so . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-008#138:2>
Last month , I had an accident on the freeway &obrack; highway
&cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#139:2>
Did I tell you before ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#140:2>
After that , I wanted to go to the emergency service by the
ambulance .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#141:2>
The doctors over there help me to check my body with the x-ray .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#142:2>
I had the x-ray on my neck and my arm .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#143:2>
But they didn't get any hurt ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#144:2>
everything is fine .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#145:2>
When the accident was happened , the speed of our car was about
75m/s ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#146:2>
it was so fast .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#147:2>
But I didn't get any hurt ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#148:2>
it  ' s a miracle .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#149:2>
I  ' m the lucky one !

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#150:2>
Nevertheless I  ' m receiving the <-> medeical </-> <+> medical </+>
bills right now , totally about U.S.&dollar;500 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#151:2>
But our driver  ' s insurance will help us to pay the bills .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#152:2>
The car was totally lost ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#153:2>
it was a rental car .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#154:2>
And the insurance will also pay for it . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-008#155:2>
Did you see the movie &ldquo; Ghost &rdquo; in Hong Kong ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#156:2>
I saw it last several weeks before .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#157:2>
It  ' s a good movie .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#158:2>
The female character is so pretty .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#159:2>
I like her .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#160:2>
How about my famous star &dash; Leslie Cheung ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#161:2>
Did you hear something about him ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#162:2>
Are you falling in love ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#163:2>
Do you have any boyfriend&obrack;s&cbrack; ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#164:2>
I am lonely here .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#165:2>
Are you going to study <-> aboard </-> <+> abroad </+> ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#166:2>
If you want to , please come here , please !

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#167:2>
I can send you the informations . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#168:2>
I think I must better stop writing now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#169:2>

tomorrow .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#170:2>

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#171:2>

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#172:2>
MERRY CHRISTMAS &ampersand; HAPPY NEW YEAR !

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#173:2>
Bye ! ! !

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#174:2>
Friend ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#175:2>
Ka Chun

<I>

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#177:3>
Dear Freda ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-008#178:3>
At the time you get this letter , I believe it should be after
the Christmas .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#179:3>
How fabulous that holiday was to me in the past few years .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#180:3>
I really miss the days when I was in H.K. &dash; with Popeye .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#181:3>
Anyways time have to rush , and past .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#182:3>
I wonder how I will go through the long two week  ' s holiday this
year , with my aunt and uncle who is a white man ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#183:3>
I cannot even communicate with him very well .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#184:3>
Surely you would think of my friends , that normally we go out with
our friends in holidays .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#185:3>
But I am going to tell you something ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#186:3>
I am on my own now !

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#187:3>
I believe . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-008#188:3>
I always ask myself if I am a person that nobody likes to be
with or I am a person that is not welcomed .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#189:3>
Amy , the girl that I  ' ve mentioned to you before , doesn't seem to
be my friend any more .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#190:3>
I thought of Kwan Wai Yin <O> two-Chinese-characters </O> and that
event in F.2 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#191:3>
The same thing happened to me again .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#192:3>
She is now a very good friend of Carrie , who used to be my good
friend and then ignored me suddenly and then didn't phone me for the whole
summer holiday and then pretended she didn't know me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#193:3>
What the hell does this mean ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#194:3>
I was mad on this .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#195:3>
I don't care and I  ' m not angry with Amy that she is now a close
friend of Carrie &obrack; who am I angry with that &cbrack; , but what I am
thinking is , why does she has to ignore me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#196:3>
Oh !

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#197:3>
Forget this anyway !

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#198:3>
I can do nothing to help .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#199:3>
Just wait and see how it goes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-008#200:3>
My mom is so bitchy , she never approves of anything I do .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#201:3>
She is always saying that I am such a bad girl .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#202:3>
Naughty .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#203:3>
Naughty .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#204:3>
The main reason is , I always go out with guys but not girls and all
the persons that phone me are all guys .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#205:3>
I notice that too .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#206:3>
Now I am always together with 3 or 4 guys but no girls .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#207:3>
I don't seem to feel lonely or anything unhappy but I do when they
are all away . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-008#208:3>
<-> Sometimes </-> <+> some time </+> ago you  ' ve asked me if I
have a part time or a full time boyfriend , do you remember ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#209:3>
I hesitated to tell you that I have a part time boyfriend now ! !

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#210:3>
You should be wondering why I broke my words .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#211:3>
Well , as I said , he  ' s only a part time one .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#212:3>
I cannot even talk to him for more than three minutes in the school
, but he  ' s so understanding and mature in many ways and he knows me so well .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#213:3>
Maybe I should say that he  ' s only my <-> closiest </-> <+> closest
</+> friend who is a man .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#214:3>
I find myself cannot forget Popeye although he may have forgotten me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#215:3>
I know that I should get this guy out of my heart .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#216:3>
Just give me some more time ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#217:3>
I can do it . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-008#218:3>
When I go through the above paragraph that I wrote , I found out
that I  ' ve described it too sadly .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#219:3>
But actually I just feel nothing about it .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#220:3>
Maybe it  ' s because my part time boyfriend  ' s help .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#221:3>
He really helps to make me feel better when I am down .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#222:3>
But he doesn't <del> several-characters </del> care about his
girlfriend very much who is me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#223:3>
I cannot even find him in the hallway in the recess time because his
locker is so far away from mine and he never cares to come to my locker .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#224:3>
That  ' s why I called him my part time boyfriend </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-008#225:3>
There  ' s something I want to tell you , Leslie ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#226:3>
actually Tom Cheung still phones me once in a while , about two or
three times a month .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#227:3>
He doesn't say anything special , just tell me how he  ' s doing .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#228:3>
I really get upset when I hear his voice ! </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#229:3>
I  ' ll write to you later when I have the time and patience .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#230:3>
Well , it  ' s soon enough !

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#231:3>
Tell me how you did in the exam when you next write . <O>

Hi Christopher ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-008#272:5>
This is a picture postcard of my school &ampersand; where am I ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#273:5>
The visual arts dept. located at one of the 4 similar buildings down
the middle of the postcard .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#274:5>
Yeh !

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#275:5>
The grey ones !

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#276:5>
SFU is on mountaintop of Burnaby Mt. and it  ' s exceptionally cold !

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#277:5>
Yet , I don't always wear thick clothes cos ' I  ' m adapted
&ampersand; become &ldquo; cold-blooded &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#278:5>
Just joking I wish .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#279:5>
Ok , this  ' s just a little bit gift for you &ampersand; remember to
work hard in your school , too .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#280:5>
Sure I  ' ll work hard &ampersand; shall take some photos around
myself &ampersand; post it to you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#281:5>
Hope you  ' ll do the same to keep me in touch of HK . </p>

how  ' s your everything going ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#286:6>
For the last 3 weeks I  ' ve almost worked 18 hours <-> everyday </->
<+> every day </+> so I can't really calm myself down to write to you letter .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#287:6>
Sorry for that .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#288:6>
Actually I can only calm down a bit when I go to a bath
&ampersand;/or when I fell asleep on bus trips .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#289:6>
But that  ' s over .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#290:6>
I  ' ve finished all papers and projects and heading for new things to
come on January .

<ICE-HK:W1B-008#291:6>
I  ' ve actually got some of my photos assignment but they are in one
scrap book so I  ' m not <-> goona </-> <+> gonna </+> tear down &ampersand;
