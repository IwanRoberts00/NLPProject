T/T PAYMENT FOR EURO366S AND EURO367S </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-020#30:2>
Thanks for your kind consideration as well as the said
arrangement , I u/stand that it  ' s quite impossible for you to arrange the
said payment in such a short time especially without the original documents
at hand , I would say , I owe you a big favour . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-020#31:2>
Pls find attached the invoice for the said shipment for you to
arrange the T/T payment , as I already obtained the MATE RECEIPT , and since
the ship already left Hong Kong today , therefore , I can take the mate
receipt to PIFF tomorrow for changing the Bills of Lading , then maybe I can
even fax the said document to you by tomorrow late afternoon , and send you
the original copy by Thursday morning .

<ICE-HK:W1B-020#32:2>
Will fax you the Fed Ex infos after send out the original copy .

the above T/T payment , and settle the balance after Paul returned and verify
the whole invoice .

without the B/L in their hand? , how can they guarantee to have their payment
in return ? </p>

Re : Investigation on Sono Centra  ' s Order </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-020#168:11>
A Detail <-> invertigation </-> <+> investigation </+> of the
above order had carry out dd 21st July in Jiangmen .

<ICE-HK:W1B-020#169:11>
Result as follow:

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-020#170:11>
1. In order to withhold the additional weight created by the
ceramic lamp holder , the manufacturer should require to improve the
gooseneck  ' s friction by means of changing with use of stronger / heavier
spring steel wire .

<ICE-HK:W1B-020#171:11>
In result , some unpleasant noise was generated and was furtherly
amplified by the &lsquo; speaker-like &rsquo; shape lamp reflector &obrack;
lamp head &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-020#172:11>
2. Had suggested to implement the following methods to reduce /
eliminate the said noise with &lsquo; no &rsquo; positive result . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-020#173:11>
a &cbrack; Apply lubricant jelly inside the gooseneck although
the unpleasant sound can totally be eliminated , the tension of gooseneck was
resulting reduced to an extend that can no longer withhold the lamp head
assembly . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-020#174:11>
b &cbrack; Apply rubber cushion in between the connection of
lamp head and gooseneck said noise can be reduced by approx. 50&percent; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-020#175:11>
However , it will take approx. 20 days for preparation of the
die-cut mould for the said rubber cushion . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-020#176:11>
Due to the above factors , it is recommended that unless the
client &obrack; Sono Centra &cbrack; can either accept the said noise
&obrack; cracking noise - approx. 45 db / metre &cbrack; or change to use the
plastic lamp holder , or otherwise , they must wait for another 20 days
&obrack; or a bit longer &cbrack; for the die-cut mould or no products can
furtherly be accepted . </p>
