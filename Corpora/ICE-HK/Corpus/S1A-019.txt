<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X7:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#8:1:A>
We had a training and then there were some information shown to
us about <,> what this world  ' s like what this world  ' s like in the <,> in
the in the future

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#9:1:A>
It  ' s sort of horrifying <,> of people who stay in a country like
this you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#10:1:A>
Not like this but for people who  ' s staying and working a job in an
organization

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X11:1:Z>
Oh and they <,> think that <,> to <,> impress to show you that you  ' re
lucky <,> <{1> <[1> people </[1> you come <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X12:1:Z>
They  ' re buying their way out </X>

<$A> <[1> <&> laugh </&> </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#13:1:A>
<[2> No </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#14:1:A>
That  ' s not true

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#15:1:A>
That  ' s why one of the way <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#16:1:A>
I think you know one of the way out is to <,> set up my own
business <,> in a this is <,> you just <unc> one-word </unc> this in
a <?> stage </?>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X17:1:Z>
Who told you that

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X18:1:Z>
Nu Skin or APL </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#19:1:A>
A <,> BL

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#20:1:A>
It doesn't matter

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#21:1:A>
It just

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X22:1:Z>
ABL or APL

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X23:1:Z>
You work for <{1> <[1> APL </[1> not ABL </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#24:1:A>
<[1> APL </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#25:1:A>
APL <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#26:1:A>
The visitor said their show is <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#27:1:A>
The Americans now are working on average <,> okay a hundred and
forty hours more <,> than before

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#28:1:A>
And there will be fifteen more percentage of layoff <,> and all
these layoff will happen in the management levels because all the companies
are going to be layered and there  ' s no more managers and no more directors

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#29:1:A>
And it turn out for all the companies are getting rid of the <,>
its management <,> heads you know <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#30:1:A>
So I guess I  ' m really lucky you know

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X31:1:Z>
Why are you lucky </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#32:1:A>
Because I  ' m the first one to go <{1> <[1> <O> laugh <O> </[1>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X33:1:Z>
<[1> Oh </[1> </{1> I see

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X34:1:Z>
You  ' re very optimist </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#35:1:A>
And I <unc> two words </unc> package you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#36:1:A>
And they talk about AT&T you know the company AT&T

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X37:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#38:1:A>
They just laid off uh seventeen thousand people of which
fourteen thousands are managers

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#39:1:A>
Do you <?> believe it </?>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X40:1:Z>
Wow </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#41:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#42:1:A>
It  ' s really quite amazing because now the model of business has
changed <,> and the entire business world has changed

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#43:1:A>
And <,> in a new company there is no more chain of command you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#44:1:A>
There is no more pyramid structure and just like that

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#45:1:A>
All the companies I know of actually like APL they  ' re moving
towards a very <,,> mobile structure very <unc> one-word </unc>
structure

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#46:1:A>
So no managers are <?> immediately </?> required <,,> in the future

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X47:1:Z>
You can specialize in training companies to make the move and then
<unc> one-word </unc> from one company to the other

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X48:1:Z>
That can keep you go on for ten years </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#49:1:A>
And you know what they <{1> <[1> are saying </[1>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X50:1:Z>
<[1> As a </[1> </{1> consultant </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#51:1:A>
As there there  ' s a guy called Peter Drucker who wrote some
very famous business books and <?> he says </?>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#52:1:A>
He  ' s just revised his forecast you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#53:1:A>
When he wrote that book uhm <?> I forgot Re-engineering the Company
</?> or something like that

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X54:1:Z>
The what company <unc> two words </unc> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#55:1:A>
Re-engineering the Company

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X56:1:Z>
Oh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#57:1:A>
And <,> when he first wrote the book uhm maybe a couple of
years back he was predicting thirty percent of the managers would be gone

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#58:1:A>
And now he  ' s just revised the figure to fifty percent of the
managers would be gone <,> in the near future

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#59:1:A>
So managers that are remaining are really <,,> focusing on
something that is that is totally different from what they used to <,> handle
before <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#60:1:A>
You know what they deal with is just to manage change because
change is going to happen everywhere in a company and the magnitude and the
speed is only going to increase and it  ' s not going to slow down

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#61:1:A>
So managers are only required to co-ordinate them you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#62:1:A>
Give people support and it  ' s funny they <,> they cannot predict
what skills are required in the future <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#63:1:A>
You want to know what skills are required in the future <,> for
managers to to survive <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#64:1:A>
First of all they have to have a second language because he said
because of the <,> technologies available <,,> telecommunications everything
is available people are competing jobs not only within their own country

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#65:1:A>
For example Americans are not just competing jobs with their within
America

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#66:1:A>
Because <.> ther </.>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#67:1:A>
For us for example we are competing <unc> 1-word </unc>
together so those who have a second language <,> is going to outwin <,> the
other <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#68:1:A>
I have two languages maybe two and a half languages

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#69:1:A>
I speak a little bit of France <O> laugh </O> French now <&> laugh
</&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#70:1:A>
I claim

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#71:1:A>
I will claim that I speak a little bit of French

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X72:1:Z>
Why

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X73:1:Z>
<foreign> Pourquoi </foreign> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#74:1:A>
<foreign> Pourquoi <,> parce que </foreign> <unc>
a-words-in-French </unc>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X75:1:Z>
Ah <foreign> oui </foreign> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#76:1:A>
No no we  ' ll talk English not in France

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#77:1:A>
Not in French <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#78:1:A>
So this is how <,> it all <,> showed up in the statistics

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#79:1:A>
And being a manager is not easy

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#80:1:A>
I mean before they can just use their authority and you know
exercise their power you know as long as they stay well in the politics

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#81:1:A>
They <,> they  ' ll survive but these days not any more <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#82:1:A>
Going to be quite tough in the business world

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X83:1:Z>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X84:1:Z>
What else do they gonna be required of these guys </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#85:1:A>
What else

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X86:1:Z>
You said two languages but that  ' s not all </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#87:1:A>
Oh that  ' s not all of course

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#88:1:A>
There are other things you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#89:1:A>
To be able to be uh to be able to adapt to change figure out things
and change you know <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#90:1:A>
Everything is changed

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#91:1:A>

I think people are getting <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#104:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#105:1:A>
The other thing that managers are required is to become <,> expert
in confronting the touchy issues you know inter-personal issues only at the
<unc> multiple words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#106:1:A>

I wrote it down <unc> three words </unc> read for myself

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#136:1:A>
And I can't find it because I find it very interesting <unc>
three words </unc> job

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#137:1:A>
And in fact I  ' m not not interested in working in <,> a job like
this but I  ' m interested in making studies about all these <,> things you
know

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X138:1:Z>
You consultant

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X139:1:Z>
A consultant <{1> <[1> <unc> multiple words </unc> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X140:1:Z>
Okay Listen

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X141:1:Z>
As a consultant you  ' re working for these people

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X142:1:Z>
The knowledge goes through you

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X143:1:Z>
You accumulate the knowledge

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X144:1:Z>
You  ' re making <{2> <[2> <unc> multiple words </unc>
</[2> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X145:1:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X146:1:Z>
You you  ' ll be learning A you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X147:1:Z>
And you will be <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X148:1:Z>
Yes including </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#149:1:A>
<[1> Whatever you call it <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#150:1:A>
The one consultant </[1> / { 1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#151:1:A>
<[2> Something like that </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#152:1:A>
<[3> Of course I am learning </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#153:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#154:1:A>
One of three you want to know what uh this uh of what goes in
before I can be a manager

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X155:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#156:1:A>
Additional language

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#157:1:A>
Technical competency

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#158:1:A>
That means if you don't know computer or anything else you  ' d
better be quick <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#159:1:A>
And the extraordinary people still you know have to be very very
good in handling people issues because all they have <,> in the future is
handling change

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#160:1:A>
And change <,> affects people affects people  ' s mind affects
affects people  ' s emotion and affect people  ' s productivity and they have to
be very very good in that <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#161:1:A>
And they will be able to they are <,> flexible <,> they can work
as a team member a team player team leader and whatever angle you know <.>
when </.> whenever the situation arise they will just have to jump in and
help out <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#162:1:A>
Very interesting you know <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#163:1:A>
And the training also mentions something about networking which is
going to lead to success

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X164:1:Z>
Networking </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#165:1:A>
Networking <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#166:1:A>
The power of networking

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#167:1:A>
And <,> it it encourages all the people <,> to use more in
networking to minimize or increase actually to increase the predictability of
all these changes because you get information from people

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#168:1:A>
Now information is getting more and more powerful because of the
availability of <,> telecommunication <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#169:1:A>
This will give you an example you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#170:1:A>
They mention about <,> the change in the transportation industry
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#171:1:A>
Are you listening

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X172:1:Z>
<foreign> two words </foreign> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X173:1:Z>
That was French for yes

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X174:1:Z>
<foreign> two words </foreign>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X175:1:Z>
Okay <{1> <[1> <unc> one-word </unc> </[1> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#176:1:A>
<[1> Great </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#177:1:A>
Just to <,> tell you the change is <.> trans </.> in
transportation

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#178:1:A>
Before no eight <,> at year six thousand before Christ people were
riding on the camels and they were going at the speed of eight miles per hour

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#179:1:A>
Do you remember that

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X180:1:Z>
Yes I remember </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#181:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#182:1:A>
So in the year two thousand B C something was invented

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X183:1:Z>
The wheel </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#184:1:A>
Yeah and they were going at twenty miles per hour and <,>
that was <,> a duration of four thousand years  '  development they <,> can <,>
increase the speed from eight <,> miles per hour to two to twenty miles per
hour

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#185:1:A>
And then <,,>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X186:1:Z>
<O> laugh </O>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X187:1:Z>
<unc> multiple words </unc> </X> <O> Both laughed </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#188:1:A>
And then at eight hundred is it eight hundred

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#189:1:A>
Anyway and then we invented the locomotive you know and they were
going <,> a hundred miles per hour

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#190:1:A>
All happened <,> in hundreds and thousands of years before people
invent the next thing

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#191:1:A>
But from the year one nine one nine three zero in the nineteen
thirty the plane was <,,> invented

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#192:1:A>
Aeroplanes were invented and they were going at four hundred miles
per hour compared to one hundred per miles per hours <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#193:1:A>
That  ' s an increase of three <.> hun </.> three times four times
<,> the speed okay

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#194:1:A>
However <,> at the same time nineteen-sixty <,,> they invented the
space capsule and the space capsule was going at a rate of how <{1> <[1> fast
</[1>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X195:1:Z>
<[1> Twenty </[1> </{1> five thousand miles </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#196:1:A>
Eighteen thousand miles per hour

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#197:1:A>
So all these things <,> and also information and knowledge is
exploding everywhere

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#198:1:A>
If we look at the same time line <,> before you know in uh in the
year of one five zero zero there were less than one thousand books published
in Europe per year

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#199:1:A>
But in nineteen fifty a hundred and twenty thousand books were
published in one year

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#200:1:A>
And in nineteen sixty just only ten years after three hundred
fifty thousand books per year

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#201:1:A>
Can you imagine all these books

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#202:1:A>
All these information that people need <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#203:1:A>
And they  ' re predicting what we know of today will be completely
<,> <{1> <[1> out of date </[1> in twenty months

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#204:1:A>
So <,> the statistic is saying that every twenty years the
scientific knowledge doubles <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#205:1:A>
Horrifying isn't it <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#206:1:A>
Reminds me I  ' d better get on with my computer more <,>

Okay

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X240:1:Z>
One more </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#241:1:A>
It  ' s too hot

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#242:1:A>
There  ' s no air <{> <[> in this place </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X243:1:Z>
<[> Okay go on </[> </{> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#244:1:A>
Okay

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X245:1:Z>
Alright </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#246:1:A>
And <,> it tells us how to <,> respond to all those changes
that is going on in this world you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#247:1:A>
The changes going on in the business world

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#248:1:A>
Something

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#249:1:A>
It talks about something that is very interesting <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#250:1:A>
One of the suggestions is to you know in order to maintain the
flexibility so that we can go through all these changes is get out of debt
and stay out of debt <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#251:1:A>
That means no more <,> borrowing money from the bank <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#252:1:A>
If you have a house sell it keep the money

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X253:1:Z>
Who  ' s going to buy the house <unc> two-words </unc> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#254:1:A>
Oh somebody  ' s going to keep the house of course

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#255:1:A>
They can rent it on the <unc> one-word </unc> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#256:1:A>
It  ' s the very pessimistic <,> prediction of to some <?> in </?>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#257:1:A>
To a certain extent I think it  ' s quite true because the world is
really changing and the technology is rapidly taking place of the human being
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#258:1:A>
But uh one thing that I  ' m glad to know is human resources is
because of this situation is highly in demand <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#259:1:A>
A lot of people issues need to be dealt with

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#260:1:A>
And if people issue need to be addressed <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#261:1:A>
And I  ' ve just read another book you know the the the book that I  ' ve
just bought The <unc> one-word </unc> Prophecy or something like that

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#X262:1:Z>
You read the whole book </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#263:1:A>
No I read some part of it and it  ' s talking about uhm <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#264:1:A>
It was a kind of mystical but it mentions something uh it  ' s like
<,> a uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#265:1:A>
They  ' ve found something as the rule and the <,> something like
the prophet saying or something like that

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#266:1:A>
It talks about the <,> the future world

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#267:1:A>
It  ' s kind of <,,> vaguely related to this <,> piece that I was
been talking

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#268:1:A>
Because the future world they say it  ' s going people are <,> going
through tough times and people <,> will finally realize that they have to go
through <,> some spiritual growth and unite together and go <,> go into a
warm spiritual world <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#269:1:A>
I don't know what I  ' m talking

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#270:1:A>
I  ' m so sleepy </I>

How many times did you do it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-019#324:2:A>
I don't remember

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#325:2:A>
I started doing it since ninety-two <,> so I guess one or two
years

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#326:2:A>
Ever since then I  ' ve been doing it <,> once every one or two
months or three months <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#334:2:A>
We took them out from the camp and went beside the beach

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#335:2:A>
We we we took them out from the camp and <,> went to the beach
beside the camp <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#336:2:A>
Very close and the water is very shallow so we don't have to worry
about kids getting drowned or you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#337:2:A>
It was great that they they went out uhm in the water and then the
the adults were just playing among themselves talking chatting and <,>
barbecuing <unc> two words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-019#338:2:A>
The kids were not really aiming for the food they were aiming at
the water you know
