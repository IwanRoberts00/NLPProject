<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-070#1:1:A>
May I please you my Lord

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#2:1:A>
Ladies and gentlemen members of the jury I am making my address to
you also slightly out of order <.> a </.> ahead of my learned friend for the
First Defendant

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#3:1:A>
Because <,> my client the Third Defendant is the principle culprit
against whom is alleged the count of attempted rape not attempted <,> yes
attempted rape and indecent assault have been made by the victim of this case

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#4:1:A>
And therefore I feel that it is more appropriate if I were to go
ahead first

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#5:1:A>
And dealt with those points before the counsel for the First
Defendant makes her speech to you

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#6:1:A>
Now you  ' ve been told members of the jury <,> that there is this a
distinction between the functions of a judge and your functions

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#7:1:A>
The function of His Lordship would be to direct you on the relevant
laws in relation to rape indecent assault attempted rape and the need for
corroboration

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#8:1:A>
Now those are His Lordship  ' s function

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#9:1:A>
It  ' s it  ' s not for me to tell you what the law is

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#10:1:A>
I  ' m not really qualified to do that

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#11:1:A>
Only His Lordship his own court rooms is qualified to do that

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#12:1:A>
And you must take the law from His Lordship as he tells you

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#13:1:A>
But on the other hand you will be told that you are the sole judges
on the fact

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#14:1:A>
You are the body of persons who were ultimately decide what
actually happened that evening or that early morning

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#15:1:A>
And that you will do by looking at the evidence that has been
presented before you <,> by my learned friend for the prosecution <,> and
modified or changed by cross-examination

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#16:1:A>
My learned friends have suggested their opinions of how you should
look at the evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#17:1:A>
And of course is our duty to do so but you are perfectly entitled
to ignore that if you disagree that

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#18:1:A>
His Lordship will also pass his own comments on the evidence to you

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#19:1:A>
You can ignore his comments if you want

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#20:1:A>
I think that would be the only opportunity in your life you can
ignore a judge  ' s comments for you <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#21:1:A>
At the end of the day when you ask to deliver a verdict <,> you
don't even have to give reasons

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#22:1:A>
But remember at the beginning when you were selected each one of
you either took oath <,> or affirmed to return a true verdict according to
the evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#23:1:A>
And what does it mean

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#24:1:A>
It means that you must not speculate

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#25:1:A>
It means that you must cast aside your prejudices

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#26:1:A>
It means that you must be <,> you must be you must not be
impassionate

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#27:1:A>
You have been introduced to these defendants and in particular my
my client the Third Defendant as an accused person

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#28:1:A>
Your first <.> re </.> impression of the Third Defendant may not be
that impressive

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#29:1:A>
I must say it  ' s not a very nice set of circumstances in which you
met my client

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#30:1:A>
He has been sitting behind bars

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#31:1:A>
He has been labelled the defendant

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#32:1:A>
Accusation has been against him

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#33:1:A>
But he is innocent until he  ' s proved to be guilty

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#34:1:A>
And before you retuned the verdict he is an innocent person

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#35:1:A>
And this is the beauty of our legal system

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#36:1:A>
And that is why we have the so-called burden of proof on the
prosecution

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#37:1:A>
An accused person is does not have to prove anything

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#38:1:A>
He does not have to prove his innocence

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#39:1:A>
He is not presumed to be guilty because he is charged

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#40:1:A>
Because of accusations made against him

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#41:1:A>
So I ask you members of the jury cast aside your prejudices

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#42:1:A>
Cast aside your <,> feelings of social awareness

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#43:1:A>
You may think that rape indecent assault attempted rape theses are
great social evils

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#44:1:A>
I  ' m sure you think that way

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#45:1:A>
But that is not your function

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#46:1:A>
That function will be performed <,> when it comes to His Lordship
<,> in sentencing any of these defendants

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#47:1:A>
It  ' s only then that he will reflect the public condemnation of
such behaviour

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#48:1:A>
You are not the person to do that

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#49:1:A>
You can't say <,> these boys they are so naughty they  ' ve <,> they
deserve to go to prison

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#50:1:A>
That  ' s not <,> your function

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#51:1:A>
Your functions is simply to look at the evidence to analyse it and
then to decide whether you think that the evidence is sufficient to prove
that they are guilty

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#52:1:A>
And you are sure that they are guilty

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#53:1:A>
Now <,> what does it mean <,> that the burden of proof is on the
prosecution

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#54:1:A>
My friends have explained it very clearly to you already but I
would like to add this

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#55:1:A>
When the verdict remains with the prosecution it means the
defendants do not have to prove anything

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#56:1:A>
And therefore it is not required of them to go into the witness box
to give evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#57:1:A>
They do not have to go into the witness box to say that I  ' m
innocent

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#58:1:A>
Because they are

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#59:1:A>
Until you think that otherwise because of what the prosecution has
seduced before you

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#60:1:A>
So I ask you not to draw any adverse influence against them because
they have not given evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#61:1:A>
They have not deny that they are guilty

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#62:1:A>
I  ' m sure His Lordship will tell you about that in greater detail

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#63:1:A>
Not only is the burden on the prosecution prove <,> all the
offences against these defendants

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#64:1:A>
They have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#65:1:A>
You it may seem like a legal terminology but in fact it means what
it says

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#66:1:A>
You must be sure

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#67:1:A>
You must have no reasonable doubt in your mind as to their guilt
before you can convict

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#68:1:A>
If you have any reasonable doubt whatsoever <,> that doubt must be
given to the defendant

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#69:1:A>
And he must be acquitted

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#70:1:A>
Now there are many <,> many ways <,> in which the prosecution may
have failed to prove an offence beyond a reasonable doubt

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#71:1:A>
For example <,> you may think that some of the prosecution
witnesses are not really that reliable

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#72:1:A>
You may think that a victim that she she may be a liar

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#73:1:A>
You may think that her credibilities <.> sus </.> is is suspicious

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#74:1:A>
You have seen her give evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#75:1:A>
You have watched how she changed her evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#76:1:A>
You have watched how she evaded questions under cross-examination

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#77:1:A>
She was practically <,> members of the jury refusing to supply
details of how all these happened

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#78:1:A>
Allegations are easy to make

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#79:1:A>
In this case the allegations are not supported by other evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#80:1:A>
We have an extreme <,> example <,> of a case here members of the
jury

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#81:1:A>
The police arrived according to the prosecution  ' s case <,> almost
minutes after there has been an alleged rape

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#82:1:A>
It  ' s alleged that the rapist did not use a condom

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#83:1:A>
It  ' s alleged that there was full sexual intercourse

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#84:1:A>
He was alleged there was ejaculation inside the woman

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#85:1:A>
And minutes later the police arrived

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#86:1:A>
What more can you ask for <,> from the prosecution  ' s point of view

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#87:1:A>
The suspects were not arrested a few days later

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#88:1:A>
He was not arrested months later or years later

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#89:1:A>
They were arrested minutes after an alleged rape

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#90:1:A>
Numerous items of clothings swabs samples were taken from the from
the victim from suspects

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#91:1:A>
Immediate action was taken by the police and what have we got here

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#92:1:A>
Nothing

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#93:1:A>
No contact evidence whatsoever

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#94:1:A>
No evidence of transfer of fibre between clothings

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#95:1:A>
No forensic evidence to support the victim  ' s allegation

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#96:1:A>
What what can you ask for

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#97:1:A>
If in a case of this nature you cannot have any forensic evidence
to support the victim  ' s bare allegation

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#98:1:A>
Can you really have any forensic evidence and any other cases to
support any allegation of rape

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#99:1:A>
We may as well do away of all these forensic tests in other cases
of rape <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#100:1:A>
Absolutely nothing I tell you

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#101:1:A>
And excuses have been made

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#102:1:A>
Excuses have been made for not turn out with these fruitful
results

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#103:1:A>
Matters of judgement by the doctor uh she doesn't think that it
was necessary to do this test

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#104:1:A>
Sixty one items were delivered to her

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#105:1:A>
This simply not good enough

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#106:1:A>
According to the prosecution these boys were virtually caught
red-handed

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#107:1:A>
Now what are we left with

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#108:1:A>
Nothing

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#109:1:A>
Except the words of a prostitute <,> who didn't really care how
old these boys were

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#110:1:A>
She was raped to render sexual services to them at a price

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#111:1:A>
She thought she was raped because she was never paid

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#112:1:A>
Is she a credible witness

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#113:1:A>
Can you really put the liberties of these boys at risk because of
the words of this woman <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#114:1:A>
You will be told members of the jury by His Lordship that in all
cases involving sexual allegation including rape attempted rape and indecent
assault you should look for corroborating evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#115:1:A>
And if you do not find corroborating evidence you can still
convict provide that you believe the victim

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#116:1:A>
There is none

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#117:1:A>
There is no corroborating evidence against the Third Defendant in
respect of <,> any of these three charges <,> which are left with which he
face <,> he faces

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#118:1:A>
My my learned friend for the prosecution has said corroboration is
evidence which tends to support the victim  ' s evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#119:1:A>
Now that  ' s wrong

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#120:1:A>
That is not the right legal definition for corroborating evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#121:1:A>
He is only partially right

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#122:1:A>
Not all evidence which tends to support a victim  ' s allegation or
evidence is is corroborating evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#123:1:A>
Because if it is then you can say oh the knife under the bed is
corroborating evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#124:1:A>
Uh you may say oh the finding of the of the uhm stolen property in
the possession of the accused persons that is corroborating evidence because
they support the victim  ' s evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#125:1:A>
That is absolutely wrong

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#126:1:A>
In order to be corroborating evidence in order to be evidence
which can support the victim  ' s evidence <,> in such cases involving sexual
allegations <,> such corroborating evidence must <,> be able to implicate
particular defendants in respect of the particular offence

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#127:1:A>
For example if the Third Defendant had admitted to the police
officers after he was arrested <,> that he did attempt to rape the victim
that is corroborating evidence <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#128:1:A>
The towels on the bed is not

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#129:1:A>
So you must be careful

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#130:1:A>
Now His Lordship will direct you on on the law relating to
corroborating evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#131:1:A>
And I  ' m sure that he will usually in very clear terms and it  ' s
very important for you to listen to his direction very carefully <,> because
otherwise you get mixed up

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#132:1:A>
And you may think that any any evidence which is consistent with
the victim  ' s evidences called corroborating evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#133:1:A>
And that  ' s not so

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#134:1:A>
And in this particular trial <,> there is no corroborating
evidence not even in respect of the not only in <.> res </.> in respect of
the rape but also in respect of the attempted rape and <,> the indecent
assault

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#135:1:A>
There is no other evidence except the victim  ' s bare words that
she had been indecently assaulted <,> by by the by the Third Defendant </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-070#136:2:A>
Miss Sze had already drawn your attention to quite a number
of discrepancies between the oral evidence of Madam Ng given in the court and
what she told the police in various witness statements <,> she gave in the
beginning of nineteen ninety three

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#137:2:A>
I would refresh your memory on what I believe to be the some of
the more significant discrepancies

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#138:2:A>
And I will not be able of course to deal with all discrepancies as
we  ' ve got there is quite a number of them

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#139:2:A>
Firstly <.> sh </.> she reminded you that there is a discrepancy
relating to the number of days left <,> between the time Madam Ng left hotel
Conrad <,> and the last time she stayed at the accused  ' s flat at Cheung Shan
Estate

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#140:2:A>
Another discrepancy she point out to you relate to Madam Ng  ' s
explanation as to why she left the accused  ' s flat the day before the
twentieth of November nineteen ninety two <,> whether it was as a result of
boredom as appeared in her cautioned statement

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#141:2:A>
Or whether it was because she was scared as she had said of

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#142:2:A>
The third discrepancy your attention had been drawn to is whether
<,> Hau referred to a Thursday or Friday when Madam Ng told you that she was
scolded by him <,> for leaving him too soon

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#143:2:A>
Another discrepancy your attention can be drawn to is whether the
accused went back together with Madam Ng and Hau and the other person <,>
after they left the restaurant <,> to the accused  ' s home

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#144:2:A>
And you have also been reminded of the discrepancy as to whether
the flat was in fact the accused  ' s flat or as Madam Ng said in her statement
to the police after identifying the accused that it was the accused  ' s
girlfriend  ' s flat

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#145:2:A>
Madam Ng gave you her explanations in relation to those alleged
discrepancies

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#146:2:A>
She also explained that she did not give the police as full
account of the details or had given the police some inaccurate information
because of the following reasons

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#147:2:A>
And I  ' ll remind you of them

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#148:2:A>
She first said that at that time when she was giving her statement
to the police <,> she was too frightened to talk too much

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#149:2:A>
The reason of course Mr Hau was still at large had not yet
arrested by the police

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#150:2:A>
Then she suggested that Mr Hau had in fact threatened her by the
phone over the phone

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#151:2:A>
She said that <,> she felt a lot better in court now that Mr Hau
had been arrested and she felt more secured

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#152:2:A>
And that  ' s the reason why she <.> i </.> is able to tell us more
detail

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#153:2:A>
And she also said that she did not really checked the witness
statement carefully before she signed because she was tired she she told you
that she had been for twenty four hour

<ICE-HK:S2A-070#154:2:A>
She also told you that she was able to remember more in court
because Crown Counsel had led her through what happened day by day during
that period <,> carefully and step by step </I>
