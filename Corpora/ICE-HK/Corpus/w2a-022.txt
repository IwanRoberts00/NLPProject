1. Introduction and preamble </h> </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-022#5:1>
A continual quest for developable land underscored 150 years of
urban-expansion in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#6:1>
The predominantly rugged terrain is dominated by steep slopes which
constrain city growth in the old circumharbor core .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#7:1>
Rapid population and economic growth demand land which has to be
created without respite by reclamation from the sea and cutting the
hillslopes to form platforms .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#8:1>
These two modes of site formation over the years have molded the
direction and pace of urban development which must be preceded by laborious
creation of usable land .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#9:1>
The city  ' s morphology , being prevalently high-density and high-rise
, has been dictated by this inherently limitation of land scarcity and its
high production cost . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-022#10:1>
Lands acquired by reclamation from the sea present few
constraints to development , and were rapidly filled with buildings and roads
leaving little open spaces .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#11:1>
Lands carved from hillslopes , however , are beset by geotechnical
constraints .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#12:1>
To ensure that disturbed slopes would remain stable has been a key
consideration in terracing hillsides .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#13:1>
Cutting slopes into a flight of platforms , likened to giant steps ,
requires much efforts to stabilize the intervening oversteepened sections .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#14:1>
Sometimes well vegetated pockets of residual slopes are left in the
built-up matrix as telltale legacies of the landform disturbances .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#15:1>
To maximize usable land , adjacent platforms are often separated by
vertical faces which must be protected and reinforced against failure ,
unless there is sound solid rock .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#16:1>
In the past , stone retaining walls &obrack; Geotechnical Control
Office , 1979 &semi; Teng , 1980 &cbrack; were commonly constructed to serve
this purpose . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-022#17:1>
Continual urban sprawl up the foothills has created many stone
walls .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#18:1>
The hilly northern part of Hong Kong Island , with a long development
history , has most of the oldest representatives including many older than
100 years .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#19:1>
Some are conspicuously situated at roadsides , whereas others are
sequestered behind buildings and in obscure lanes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#20:1>
Over the years , the method and the style of construction gradually
evolved , resulting in a wide variety of walls with elaborate masonry
occurring in equally varied environs .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#21:1>
As soon as these artificial vertical habitats were formed , nature  ' s
cliff-hangers would begin to colonize the vacant niches .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#22:1>
Most walls nurture a rich complement of flora of different growth
forms , including mosses , lichens , ferns , herbs , shrubs , climbers and
trees , together with diverse wildlife .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#23:1>
Of the assorted denizens , the biomass and ecological-environmental
benefits of large trees deserve particular attention . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-022#24:1>
The landscape of the hilly neighborhoods , otherwise monotonous
and sterile , has been decorated by stone walls and their living companions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#25:1>
The older crop of walls is often blanketed by dense vegetation with
large trees up to 20m tall .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#26:1>
The ecological and cityscape value of such natural ingredients
deserve to be treasured , yet they have been largely taken for granted if not
neglected .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#27:1>
Recent widespread redevelopment of the hilly districts have damaged
and obliterated many fine walls .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#28:1>
New city extensions into fringe slopes carve huge platforms separated
by engineered slopes rather than retaining walls .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#29:1>
New retaining structures , occasionally needed , are invariably made
of reinforced concrete &obrack; to meet stringent geotechnical requirements
&cbrack; rather than stone .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#30:1>
Old stones walls in Hong Kong have become a threatened heritage .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-022#31:1>
This study aims at assessing comprehensively this diminishing
resource , ruderal vegetation on a special ruderal habitat &obrack; Frenkel ,
1970 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#32:1>
Intrinsic and extrinsic wall variations present a plethora of chances
for vegetation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#33:1>
An empirical evaluation of both walls and trees can throw lights on
the ecological relationship between the two intimate partners .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#34:1>
As most wall vegetation studies were carried in the temperate lands
&obrack; e.g. Segal , 1969 &semi; Darlington , 1981 &cbrack; , this
humid-tropical study can provide comparative data .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#35:1>
Analysis of detailed information gleaned in the field helps to :
&obrack; 1 &cbrack; understand the nature , distribution and environs of
stone walls , for plant-growth substrate in the city &semi; &obrack; 2
&cbrack; to enumerate the species composition and relative abundance of the
attached trees &semi; &obrack; 3 &cbrack; to evaluate the growth condition
and problems of the wall trees &semi; &obrack; 4 &cbrack; to identify
candidate walls and trees for conservation &semi; &obrack; 5 &cbrack; to
explore the long-term management strategy of old stone walls and trees . </p>
<bold> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#36:1>
2. Study area and methods </h> </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-022#37:1>
The location of walls were initially pinpointed on 1:1000
large-scale maps .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#38:1>
A reconnaissance of 100 walls in different districts provided basic
knowledge about walls and trees to design two detailed field record forms to
facilitate systematic data collection .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#39:1>
The wall form assembles data on location , material , stone
dimensions , surface smoothness , surface moisture , weathering status ,
joint type and condition , wall aspect , inclination and exposure , wall
environs , vegetation cover , integrity and threats to wall existence .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#40:1>
The tree form assesses tree position on the wall , species , tree
height , surface root length and density , crown spread , integrity and
restriction , and overall tree performance rating species .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#41:1>
Each wall form is tied to one or more tree forms .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#42:1>
The possible answers were largely of a closed-ended nature to
minimize subjective judgement and to facilitating microcomputer database
treatment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-022#43:1>
A pilot study on 30 walls and 60 trees was conducted to test the
applicability of the record forms and to gather feedbacks to refine them .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#44:1>
The study area was then divided into small enclaves each
approximately equivalent to 1 day of field work .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#45:1>
Most walls were found on northern Hong Kong Island with the oldest
city core dating back to 1840s .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#46:1>
The field survey focused on this study area where walls over 1 m tall
and wall tree over 1 m tall , attached on them , were evaluated .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#47:1>
Only the retaining walls &obrack; holding back soil materials
&cbrack; were included &semi; free-standing ones were not .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#48:1>
A wall tree was defined as one with most of its roots spreading on or
penetrating through the wall face , and with the trunk base situated within
the confines of a wall .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#49:1>
A tree overhanging above a wall but not physically attached to it ,
and a tree with trunk base and most roots located outside a wall  ' s
boundaries , did not qualify . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-022#50:1>
A 3-month intensive field study was conducted in the summer
&obrack; June-August &cbrack; of 1996 to gauge the trees in their prime
growing season .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#51:1>
A total of 505 walls and 1275 trees were assessed Wall locations were
plotted on 1:5000 maps which was the working scale .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#52:1>
Two computer files , namely for wall and tree data , were created
with Microsoft Excel Version 5.0 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#53:1>
Statistical analysis was performed with SPSSPC for Windows Version
6.1 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#54:1>
Botanical nomenclature follows those of Agriculture and Fisheries
Department &obrack; 1993 &cbrack; and Jim &obrack; 1990 &cbrack; . </p>
<bold> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#55:1>
3. Stone walls as vegetation habitat </h> </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-022#56:1>
The enumerated 505 stone walls are found in the older hilly
neighborhoods built on Hong Kong Island .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#57:1>
Two districts have a significant clustering of walls , taking up
40&percent; of the total number .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#58:1>
There is a marked concentration in several winding two-lane roads
that run largely along the contour where most large wall trees &less-than; 6
are attached .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#59:1>
The old urban-sprawl mode tended to terrace hillslopes into small
pockets separated by stone retaining walls &semi; recent developments formed
large tracts bounded by cut and fill slopes rather than walls .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#60:1>
By land use , the low- to medium-density residential areas contain
most walls and associated trees .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#61:1>
Hilly lands are mainly earmarked for better-quality private housing .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#62:1>
Other land uses , except high density residential , have few and
scattered walls . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-022#63:1>
The walls are found within 20-400 m altitudinal range , with the
majority in the 20-200 m bracket .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#64:1>
Most walls are highly or moderately exposed , and face north which is
the main slope direction in the study area .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#65:1>
This factor carries both positive and negative connotations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#66:1>
Exposed walls are subject to more direct sunshine and wind , and may
be more prone to desiccation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#67:1>
Exposure , however , can allow walls to receive more rainwater by
lateral impaction due to wind .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#68:1>
Furthermore , exposure provides opportunities for the wind vector to
admit extraneous propagules and disseminate resident propagules . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-022#69:1>
Only a few walls incline over 10 degrees from the vertical &semi;
the remaining are vertical or nearly so .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#70:1>
Other things being equal , inclination may allow marginally easier
lodging of seeds .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#71:1>
Deviation from the vertical can facilitate capture of rainwater .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#72:1>
Wall stones are mainly granite &obrack; 60&percent; &cbrack; which
are lighter in color , and secondarily volcanic which are much darker .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#73:1>
The latter contains more mafic minerals which upon weathering can
release more basic nutrients .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#74:1>
Its dark color absorbs more radiant energy and attains a higher stone
temperature which accelerates drying of walls .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#75:1>
No wall is constructed with a mixture of stones .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#76:1>
Both rock types are commonly found in Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-022#77:1>
Most stone faces have either smooth or moderately so finish ,
with only a few roughly-hewn .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#78:1>
Uneven stone surface could furnish more landing opportunities for
propagules and more secure root anchorage .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#79:1>
The stones show different degrees of incipient weathering ,
reflecting wall age which for many exceeds a century .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#80:1>
The most weathered ones are likely to be pre-weathered .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#81:1>
Weathering rate in the humid-tropical condition , in an subaerial
rather than subterranean environment , is unlikely to attain an advanced
stage within the 150 years maximum tenure of the oldest walls &obrack; Ollier
, 1984 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#82:1>
The weathered minerals can release nutrients for wall vegetation
&obrack; Woodell , 1979 &cbrack; , supplementing a resource in restricted
supply . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-022#83:1>
Moisture availability is a crucial factor that imparts life on
walls .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#84:1>
Some 57&percent; of the walls have dry surfaces despite surveying
during the summer rainy season .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#85:1>
The remaining walls are moist , with some having localized seepage
and others pervasively moisture-laden .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#86:1>
The back-of-wall land use is a pivotal control of moisture status .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#87:1>
Infiltrated rainwater soaking the soil behind walls supplies seepage
outflow through weep holes and joints .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#88:1>
Extensive stretch of vegetated slope above walls provides a ready
source of moisture replenishment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#89:1>
Walls situated on the upper edge of the city have such a favorable
disposition .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#90:1>
Occasionally , in times of heavy downpour at an intensity exceeding
soil infiltration capacity , surface runoff may spread from the abutting
slope onto or cascade down wall faces , and water may shoot out of weepholes .
</p> <O> table </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-022#91:1>
For the few walls adjacent to well-wooded companion slopes , the
high humidity environment allowed capture of atmospheric moisture in a
process similar to fog straining .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#92:1>
A well vegetated slope is more able to store water and release it
gradually over a longer period between rainfalls .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#93:1>
Moreover , a site with luxuriant vegetation cover has more organic
matter and more fertile soils , thus generating more eutrophic outflows .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#94:1>
The nutrients thus conveyed to walls , a continual material input
into the mural ecosystem , constitute an important means of sustenance for
vegetation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#95:1>
Stones can hardly store water and the tiny volume of soil in the
joints has meager storage capacity .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#96:1>
For small plants with limited root spread , the timeliness and
adequacy of water supply is a critical survival determinant . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-022#97:1>
Surface area of walls is limited , with 79&percent; in the
&less-than; 250 m&squared; small class , and only a few in the large 750-1000
and &greater-than; 1000 m&squared; categories .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#98:1>
The largest wall attains 2340 m&squared; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#99:1>
By linear dimensions &obrack; Table 1 and Fig. 1 &cbrack; , most
walls are 2.5-5.0 m in height and 25-50 m width .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#100:1>
The longest wall reaches 310 m and the tallest 12 m .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#101:1>
The wide walls are dominated by granite , whereas the tall walls are
both granitic and volcanic .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#102:1>
In line with the species-area concept , large walls were expected to
accommodate more species .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#103:1>
Besides presenting a large physical surface for plant attachment ,
they are likely to furnish more microvariations in habitat conditions , hence
a diversity of niches .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#104:1>
They are also more conspicuous if not imposing urban landscape
features .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#105:1>
Tall walls , however , are more likely to be construed as a safety
threat especially if they are situated close to buildings . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-022#106:1>
Most stones are 30-40 cm height and 20-60 cm wide &semi; the
widest stones reach over 200 cm , and the tallest over 60 cm &obrack; Fig. 2
&cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#107:1>
Walls made of large stones are mainly granitic .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#108:1>
Small stone means more gaps between individual ones , hence a better
chance for seepage , propagule lodging and root anchorage .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#109:1>
Some 77&percent; of the walls have regularly-shaped stones , either
square or rectangular , and the remainder are irregular &obrack; subrounded
or subangular &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#110:1>
Irregularity provides <0> 2-graphs </0> more and wider
inter-stone gaps furnishing benefits analogous to small stones .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#111:1>
Most joints are mortared with flush or ribbon pointing .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#112:1>
Only 3.6&percent; of the walls have open joints , being the oldest
representatives .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#113:1>
Most joints are either intact/original or intact/repaired &semi; few
walls have broken mortar at the joints .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#114:1>
With open or broken joints , advantages similar to small stones
mentioned above can be achieved . </p> <bold> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#115:1>
4. Characteristics of wall trees </h> </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-022#116:1>
The surveyed walls contain vegetation of different growth forms
, ranging from mosses and lichens , to ferns and herbs , and to shrubs and
trees .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#117:1>
The wall plants are due to spontaneous colonization unassisted by
human actions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#118:1>
As mimicry of nature  ' s rocky precipices , the wall habitat is
expected to harbor a similar plant assemblage .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#119:1>
The humid-tropical environment of Hong Kong , with an inherently
rich native flora enriched by exotic components , has many candidate species
with different degrees of suitability to wall existence .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#120:1>
Some 49.5&percent; of the walls harbor trees , a total 1275
individuals from 30 species , which are conspicuous by virtue of biomass ,
ecological and environmental significance &obrack; Table 1 and Table 2
&cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#121:1>
In comparison , roadside trees in urban Hong Kong reach 149 species
&obrack; Jim , 1996 &cbrack; , and the total tree species of the territory is
about 300 &obrack; Agricultural and Fisheries Department , 1993 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#122:1>
In relative terms , the tree species diversity on walls is subdued .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#123:1>
In terms of habitat stress level and limited surface area , that
some 30 species can establish despite the heavy odds is an impressive record .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#124:1>
No data on wall vegetation in other tropical areas is available for
comparison .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#125:1>
Temperate-latitude walls are dominated by non-woody species of herbs
, ferns and lower plants , with trees as minor or rare elements &obrack;
Segal , 1969 &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-022#126:1>
The tree stock is dominated by a small number of common species
, accompanied by uncommon to rare ones &obrack; Table 2 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#127:1>
The top three species take up 72.7&percent; and the top 12 as high
as 96.7&percent; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#128:1>
Some 18 species have frequencies below 10 , of which 11 are solitary
specimens .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#129:1>
Most walls have two to five species each &semi; those with less than
two or more than five species are less common .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#130:1>
Native species are predominant , mainly Moraceae &obrack; Mulberry
family &cbrack; , and to a lesser extent Ulmaceae &obrack; Elm family
&cbrack; , <O> TABLE </O> Oleaceae &obrack; Olive family &cbrack; ,
Myrsinaceae &obrack; Ardisia family &cbrack; , Euphorbiaceae &obrack; Spurge
family &cbrack; , and Lauraceae &obrack; Laurel family &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#131:1>
Exotic trees are rarely found , constituting merely 1.89&percent;
from six species .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#132:1>
Only one of the top 12 species is exotic &semi; the remaining five
exotic species are sparsely represented . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-022#133:1>
By botanical family , Moraceae is overwhelming dominant with
seven species and 87.6&percent; of the trees .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#134:1>
The genus <it> Ficus </it> contributing six species , five of which
are native , is the undisputed arboreal leader on walls .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#135:1>
The evergreen <it> Ficus microcarpa </it> alone occupies 50&percent;
of the wall-tree population .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#136:1>
The species is naturally found in local woodlands of the lowland
evergreen variety &obrack; Zhang et al. , 1989 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#137:1>
It is commonly planted as amenity trees in the city &obrack; Jim ,
1990 &cbrack; , furnishing the largest and oldest urban specimens including
high-caliber champion trees &obrack; Jim , 1994a , b &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#138:1>
It is renowned for huge final size up to 20 m in height and crown
spread , for longevity easily over 500 years , and for environmental
tolerance to persevere in stressful urban sites .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#139:1>
The species stocks most walls and most of the largest wall trees .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#140:1>
They are the wall-tree par excellence of the city , providing
important landmark features in the hilly neighborhoods .

<ICE-HK:W2A-022#141:1>
Moreover , they serve as wildlife habitats especially for birds ,
adding faunal diversity to the city  ' s biotic community . </p> </I>
