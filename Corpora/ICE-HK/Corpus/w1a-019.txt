b &cbrack; Retrogradation </h>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#2:1>
Starch granule compose of both <del> amylote </del> amylose and
amylopection .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#3:1>
Amylose is <del> <?> a </?> </del> mainly straight chain with more
than 200 glucose subunit join <del> <.> togert </.> </del> together by
&alpha;1-4 linkage .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#4:1>
For Amylopectin , there is branch chain by &alpha;1-6 linkage .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#5:1>
The side chain <del> use </del> usually with 25 unit of glucose . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#6:1>
In starch granule , they are <del> <.> p </.> </del> located
together .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#7:1>
When the starch granule is <del> heat </del> soaked in <.> <del> sus
</del> </.> enough water the water go into the granule and cause swelling .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#8:1>
When it is heat , <del> at </del> at around 40-50&degree;C , <?>
gelatinization </?> take place and amylose first come out .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#9:1>
Then the amylopectin come out later when <del> <.> he </.> </del> temp
rise .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#10:1>
This cause increase in viscosity and the starch granule take up water .
</p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#11:1>
<del> When the </del> When the solution of gelatinized starch is
cooled .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#12:1>
The amylose <del> and amylose </del> chain with the glucose unit act
together .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#13:1>
<del> the </del> The hydroxyl group and hydrogen atom interact
together to form <del> H </del> hydrogen bond .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#14:1>
If the cooling temp is quick , the <del> <.> or </.> </del> glucose
unit in the chain do not <del> <.> oro or og </.> </del> organized well and
there is great space between the <?> <del> <.> t </.> </del> </?> chain ,
water is hold <?> in </?> this space and a gel is <del> <.> f </.> </del>
form . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#15:1>
For <del> a </del> the <del> gell </del> gel is stored for long
time , <del> there is </del> the amylose chain crystalize <del> and </del> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#16:1>
The amylose chain straighten <del> <.> ou </.> </del> and there is
well organize structure formed .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#17:1>
The amylose chain form a zipper structure .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#18:1>
The water <del> <?> <.> fom </.> </?> </del> formerly held in the
space between the chain is expelled from the chain and water lose . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#19:1>
<del> At </del> As the <unc> <del> 1-character </del>
</unc> amylose <del> for chain <unc> 1-character </unc> </del>
crystalized .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#20:1>
The <del> chain <.> becom </.> </del> gel structure become rubbery
and opaque .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#21:1>
<del> 1-character </del> The whole process is called Retrogradation .
</p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#22:1>
Retrogradation take place <del> make </del> mainly in the <del>
<?> amyle </?> </del> amylose chain which have the chain to length about 200
glucose .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#23:1>
As the cereal starch usually have <del> <.> ch </.> </del> amylose
chain about 200 glucose , therefore the <del> <.> amy </.> </del> cereal
starch is <del> <unc> 1-character </unc> </del> low in quality .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#24:1>
Amylopectin do not retrograde <del> well </del> easily because of the
branch chain and short <?> chain </?> . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#25:1>
If the gel is cooling store the ice crystal is form in the gel
and the size of the crystal increase during the storage .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#26:1>
When the gel is <del> <.> p freez </.> </del> thaw .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#27:1>
The ice crystal melt and the water provide <del> the </del> space for
the amylose chain to mobile , the chain <del> become </del> form <del> <.>
crystalla </.> </del> crystallization and the water <?> formerly </?> held is
<del> <.> expl </.> </del> expell .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#28:1>
Watery gel and opaque , rubby gel is form .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#29:1>
This is call syneresis and is a kind of Retrogradation . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#30:1>
<del> When <unc> 1-character </unc> </del> In bread
baking , the amylose leach out and form <del> gell </del> stable gel outside
the granule <del> and </del> but amylopectin stay inside the granule .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#31:1>
After store a period of time the amylose do not <del> <.> reg </.>
</del> retrograde because it is stable but the <del> chain <.> 1-character
</.> </del> amyolpectic do retrograde .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#32:1>
<del> The side chain or </del> The formerly expand side chain <del>
from </del> form crystallization <del> in the </del> inside the granule .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#33:1>
Then the bread become hard <del> an </del> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#34:1>
<del> When </del> Also The bread <-> with </-> <+> <?> will </?> </+>
lose it taste and <del> <unc> 2-characters </unc> </del> crust become
tough . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#35:1>
These <del> <.> sym undersid </.> </del> undesirable change is
group and call staling Retrogradation of the amylopectin become take part in
this process . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#36:1>
The <del> <.> im </.> </del> improve the gel strength
modification of starch chain can be use .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#37:1>
<del> They <.> in </.> </del> It include acid modified and <del> <.>
cro </.> </del> crosslinkage . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#38:1>
4 &obrack; c &cbrack; Crosslinkage </h>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#39:1>
Crosslinkage of starch required the formation of diester of
starch <unc> 3-characters </unc> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#40:1>
<del> Na </del> Sodium diphosphate is involved in the interlinkage of
2 starch chain .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#41:1>
The <del> <.> di </.> </del> diphosphate <del> links </del> interact
with the <del> <.> sto </.> </del> glucose unit of the amylose and
amylopectin chain <del> <unc> 1-character </unc> </del> and make
them link together .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#42:1>
The net result is increase the size of chain .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#43:1>
This cause change in physical property of the starch . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#44:1>
<del> For <.> W </.> </del> The increase size <del> <.> mole </.>
</del> starch granule will have a increase range of gelatinization and the
gelatinization temp also increase . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#45:1>
It is because <del> expanded <.> g </.> </del> linked starch
chain swell less and not easy to leach out the granule . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#46:1>
<del> The a The leached or starch chain </del> The linkage of
starch <-> retrict </-> <+> restricts </+> the expansion of the granule so
the granule swell less . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#47:1>
<del> As less starch chain leach out , the less </del> There
<del> <.> <?> mau </?> </.> </del> is even some intact <del> <.> granu </.>
</del> starch granule at high temp eg. 100&degree;C . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#48:1>
As less starch chain leach out , there is less resistance in the
solution <del> and </del> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#49:1>
So the <del> <.> re ve </.> </del> viscosity of linked starch
solution is lower . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#50:1>
<del> However , the chain is less </del> In normal starch , <del>
the viscosity </del> the viscosity of the solution decrease due to shear
thinning but it is not the case in the linked starch as less starch in the
solution . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#51:1>
<del> <.> Als </.> </del> As shown in diagram when the <del> <.>
<?> acitu </?> </.> </del> acidity increase , the normal starch with have
viscosity decrease , but not in the linked starch . <O> graph </O> </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#52:1>
In acidic , <del> <.> e </.> </del> the <del> <unc>
3-characters </unc> </del> acid hydrolysis of starch chain take place and
make the starch chain decrease in size

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#53:1>
this make the starch chain interact together more well and cause
greater resistance to the flow so rise in the viscosity . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#54:1>
Cross-linkage has significant effect in gel quality . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#55:1>
<del> As </del> The rate of <del> <?> <.> H </.> </?> </del>
Retrogradation is dependent on the ease of the starch chain to <del> <.> m
</.> </del> move inside the gel to <del> <.> fro </.> </del> form
crystallization .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#56:1>
Crosslinkage make the starch chain become difficult so that the gel
is stable and do not form opaque <del> <?> <.> rbo </.> </?> </del> rubby gel
easy .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#57:1>
The <del> <.> star </.> </del> gel make from it <del> is less </del>
can store longer without quality chain . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#58:1>
Also <del> at </del> as there is less , starch chain in the <del>
<.> soluti go leac </.> </del> linked starch solution .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#59:1>
The gel form it do not have much <?> <del> <.> interg </.> </del>
</?> interaction between the neighbour chain .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#60:1>
When the gel is cut , the cut is <del> less <.> sha </.> </del> sharp .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#61:1>
This quality is important in <del> jello </del> jelly making . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#62:1>
As the quality of cereal starch can be increase by cross linkage
, <del> <unc> 3-characters </unc> </del> this method is very
important in industry .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#63:1>
Because a cheaper cereal starch such as corn can change into high
quality starch . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#64:1>
3 </h>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#65:1>
<del> Gran </del> Corn grain is very important because all the
corn plant can be use without <del> wasteing </del> waste .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#66:1>
The <del> <.> oi </.> </del> germ in corn can be extracted for oil .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#67:1>
The starch can be <del> use </del> converted into sweetener .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#68:1>
The starch remain part of corn plant can be <del> be </del> used for
alcohol production while the residue can be use as animal feed . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#69:1>
Therefore <del> corn </del> a <-> whol </-> <+> whole </+> corn
plant can be used up <del> <?> and </?> </del> to produce high value good and
less waste treatment is required as less waste is produced .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#70:1>
So corn <del> <.> p </.> </del> grow in important . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#71:1>
In the production of <del> these <.> produ </.> </del> corn
product .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#72:1>
The corn is wet milled to produced and <-> seperate </-> <+> separate
</+> all the <del> <?> chemicial </?> </del> chemical component .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#73:1>
Then the separate is used for different production .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#74:1>
For sweetener product it account for 75&percent; of corn starch use
and 50&percent; sweetener market .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#75:1>
In <del> <.> Sweente </.> Sweetener </del> this production , the
starch is first thinned by enzyme ie &alpha; amylase or <del> &alpha; </del>
&beta; amylase and <del> The </del> under heating .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#76:1>
The long starch chain is broken <del> is </del> into smaller size
starch chain . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#77:1>
<.> <del> Th </del> </.> When the <del> starch is </del> thinning
of starch product and dextrose equilviant DE of 10-15 .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#78:1>
The <del> <.> p </.> </del> thinning is stopped and the thinning
<del> can </del> go for saccarification . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#79:1>
In this process , <del> the </del> glucoamylase which can break
starch chain completely to its glucose <unc> 1-word </unc> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#80:1>
To aid the process , <del> the </del> pullulase is also act to break
the &alpha;1-6 side chain .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#81:1>
By this method , high amount of dextrose with DE over 99.8 is
produced .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#82:1>
The dextrose can be shipped for sale or convert to high fructose corn
syrup <del> for </del> HFCS . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#83:1>
In the production of HFCS , the dextrose is convert be <del>
<unc> 2-characters </unc> </del> isomerase .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#84:1>
This enzyme convert <del> <.> 1-character </.> </del> dextrose to
fructose .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#85:1>
With suitable environment , 42&percent; fructose can be produce and
<del> it </del> this with similar sweetness of sucrose .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#86:1>
The HFCS product can be shipped for sale or further processed to
increase the fructose concentration .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#87:1>
The <-> frustose </-> <+> fructose </+> is purified by chromatography
to give 90&percent; <-> frustose </-> <+> fructose </+> . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#88:1>
This <-> frustose </-> <+> fructose </+> solution can be dilute
with <del  <unc> > 1-character </unc> </del> 42&percent; fructose to
give 55&percent; fructose which have the same sweetness of sucrose .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#89:1>
For the starch , it can be modified to <-> mimmic </-> <+> mimic </+>
high value starch . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#90:1>
Also , oil extraction is also a main use of <del> <unc>
1-character </unc> </del> corn .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#91:1>
The germ separated from wet milling is crusted to <del> pressed
</del> press <del> out </del> oil out .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#92:1>
Usually 80&percent; oil can be obtain .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#93:1>
The <del> crusted </del> expressed germ meal is extracted with
solvent to recover the remain oil . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#94:1>
As mention before , the remain of corn plant and the <del>
<unc> 1-character </unc> </del> residue in wet milling can be used
without waste . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#95:1>

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#96:1>
These <del> residue </del> remain <del> <.> plo </.> </del> part is
first digested by enzyme such as cellulose , &alpha; and &beta; <del> <.> en
</.> </del> amylase to give fermentable sugar .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#97:1>
Then yeast or other alcohol production <del> <unc> 1-character
</unc> </del> microorganism can be added to <del> cause </del> produce
alcohol for industrial use .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#98:1>
The alcohol can mixed with <-> petroleium </-> <+> petroleum </+> to
give gasohol <del> for </del> as car <?> fuel </?> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#99:1>
This process is practise in Brazil . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#100:1>
<del> The </del> To produce Beverage alcohol corn starch can
used for alcohol production with the similar method . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#101:1>
Therefore corn is very useful and high value .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#102:1>
The corn is grow in the poor country to improve their income . <.>
<del> Bra </del> </.> </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#103:1>
Corn growing is possible <-> is possible </-> is most part of
world .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#104:1>
China has a large piece of land and she can also grow corn to
improve their income . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#105:1>
Although the industry <del> use </del> processing of corn is not
common in China , she can export the corn to country for sale or use <del> in
</del> it in another way .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#106:1>
Animal Breeding is common <del> <unc> 2-characters </unc>
</del> in china .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#107:1>
She can grow corn to <del> <.> po </.> </del> provide feed for these
animal .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#108:1>
<del> But </del> By this method , low price corn can be convert into
high value animal meat for sale </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#109:1>
For the feed production , the corn is also wet milled .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#110:1>
The steep corn liquid which high in soluble protein eg. albumin
<del> and </del> is mixed with the germ as bran to produced Corn Gluten Feed .
</p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#111:1>
This feed is high energy to the ruminant because it is high in
fiber .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#112:1>
It can be used to fatten the cow and other ruminant before sale .
</p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#113:1>
There are also <del> a </del> other <del> use of </del> feed
produced from the corn such as Corn Gluten meal which is high in the glutent
and Corn germ meal which high in fat .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#114:1>
Supplement of feed can be <del> <.> 2-characters </.> </del> added
by putting the residue of <del> <.> W </.> </del> alcoholic <del> <.> rema
</.> </del> waste to the feed . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#115:1>
As corn is low in lysine content , it <del> <unc>
1-character </unc> </del> should be <del> <.> s </.> </del> feed with
soya bean to balance the feed .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#116:1>
With a right <.> <del> comp </del> </.> combination of the feed
<del> the <.> f su </.> </del> Right amt of nutrient can provide for the
animal growth . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#117:1>
Therefore , <del> <.> corm </.> </del> corn is really a valuable
plant as all of the part of corn plant can be use without waste . </p> <h>

<del> Storage <.> pro </.> </del> In wheat , 4 type of protein
is found .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#120:1>
They are <del> <.> alu </.> </del> water soluble <-> albulmin </->

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#121:1>
The <del> <?> few </?> </del> first two albumin &ampersand;
globulin <del> is </del> contain high value amino acid but the last two <del>
<.> g </.> </del> prolamine and gluteline <del> <.> is </.> </del> contain
less essential amino acid such as lysine .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#122:1>
Actually the prolamine and glutelin <del> is </del> are storage
protein <del> and </del> and they have similar amino acid component and they
are <del> group group to be </del> called gluten </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#123:1>
<del> Wheat </del> The major wheat product is bread because only
wheat flour can <del> be </del> form dough .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#124:1>
The quality of the bread produced can be determined by the <del> <.>
nutrien </.> </del> nutrition value , texture and taste of the <del> <.> s
</.> </del> bread . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#125:1>
<del> <unc> 1-character </unc> </del> In term of
nutrition , high lysine content in the bread is <del> <.> desirea </.> </del>
desirable .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#126:1>
<del> <unc> 1-character </unc> </del> While the lysine
content is determined by the storge protein content .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#127:1>
If the amt of storage protein <del> <.> concen con </.> </del> is
high .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#128:1>
This low lysine content protein will dilute the amt of lysine in the
<del> flowr </del> flour <del> Therefore </del> and reduce the nutrition
level . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#129:1>
The amount of storge product is determined by genetic and the
nutrient supply in the final stage of growth .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#130:1>
High nutrient in the final grow stage will increase the storage
protein content but less rise in the lysine rich albumin and globulin level .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#131:1>
This problem can be solved by <del> growth </del> growing
genetically modified <del> high </del> low storage protein cultivar . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#132:1>
For the texture , <del> the <.> s glu prob </.> </del> prolamine
provides a less resistant to flow properties to the dough <?> when </?> <del>

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#133:1>
Also it also <del> <.> m g </.> </del> <?> gives </?> a sticky
properties .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#134:1>
However glutelin is resistance to flow and give elastic properties
to the dough when hydrated .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#135:1>
These <del> two <unc> 1-character </unc> </del> storage
protein <del> mix </del> act together to give the unique <del> <.> flo </.>

account for the texture of bread . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#136:1>
For a bread to be <del> make </del> made , the flour should be
mixed with other ingredient to give dough .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#137:1>
The dough is then <?> formed </?> <del> to </del> and bake . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#138:1>
In the mixing , the amount of glutent &obrack; storage protein
&cbrack; affect the mixing time .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#139:1>
Glutent is high in Disulphur bond &obrack; -S-S- &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#140:1>
The disulphur can interconvert with - SH ie. -S-S-
&bidirectional-arrow; - SH .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#141:1>
In the <del> present </del> presence of the fast <del> acid </del>
acting oxidant the <del> S- </del> - SH bond will be convert to - S-S- bond .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#142:1>
This make the amt of -S-S- bond increase .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#143:1>
The -S-S- will then <?> be </?> formed thiyl radicle which attack
the activated double bond .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#144:1>
This attack <del> <.> me </.> make it <.> res </.> </del> reduce the
mixing time of dough and it will cause overmixing <del> easy </del> easily is
control of mix time is ineffective . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#145:1>
The overmixed dough will be glossy , watery as water is release
from the chain .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#146:1>
The dough become sticky and lose the desirable <del> <.> pro po </.>
</del> properties .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#147:1>
<del> Therefore high </del> The <del> <.> doug </.> </del> bread
make from this will have poor texture . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#148:1>
Therefore high storage protein content make <del> <unc>
2-characters </unc> </del> dough overmix easily and it form poor bread .
</p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#149:1>
Glutent is <del> <.> sai </.> </del> say to be able <del> be
</del> to hold gas by some people .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#150:1>
The Glutent can <del> <.> sto </.> retain </del> retain the gas
given out in fermentation and give spongy bread . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#151:1>
Also the Glutent &obrack; storage protein &cbrack; can hold
water when <del> <.> dehyd </.> </del> hydrated .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#152:1>
In Baking the <del> <.> do </.> </del> glutent <?> denature </?> to
give out for the starch <del> <.> gelatizat gl </.> </del> gelatinization .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#153:1>
The glutent <del> form </del> provide support to the dough before
the starch is gelatinized to take to the <unc> 1-word </unc> to
maintain the structure .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#154:1>
The Glutent film hold the gas and spongy structure and prevent the
collapse of bread .

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#155:1>
Therefore high storage protein can maintain the shape of the bread .
</p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-019#156:1>
The storage protein affect the bread quality in the way mention
aboved . <del>

<ICE-HK:W1A-019#157:1>
Therefore they are <unc> 1-word </unc> </del> </p> </I>
