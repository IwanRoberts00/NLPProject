US Commerce Secretary Ron Brown says human rights are vital to the
United States but his priority is business

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#3:1:A>
That message came as Brown began his week-long tour of China

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#4:1:A>
His arrival yesterday coincided with the detention of Chinese
dissident Wang Dan

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#5:1:A>
Linda Lee reports from Beijing <O> report by Linda Lee with speech

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#6:1:A>
Chinese dissident Wang Dan has been freed twelve hours after he was
taken away by the police from his home in Beijing yesterday

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#7:1:A>
The twenty-five-year-old student leader of the nineteen eighty-nine
Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement said he will sue the Chinese
Government if it continues to keep a close watch on him <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#8:1:A>
Speaking from his home in Beijing Wang Dan told us the police had
warned him to stop protesting against being kept under surveillance <O>
speech by Wang Dan </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#9:1:A>
He had no idea why he was allowed to leave in the middle of the
night but earlier his family was asked to bring him some clothes for what he
expected to be long-term detention

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#10:1:A>
Last Thursday Wang Dan wrote to foreign journalists expressing his
anger about being watched by the police round the clock

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#11:1:A>
He was being detained without explanation

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#12:1:A>
His release coincided with the arrival of the US Commerce Secretary
in the Chinese capital but Wang said the police made no mention of the
American official  ' s visit

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#13:1:A>
The surveillance on him has been stepped up

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#14:1:A>
Wang believes several policemen are in the building where he lives

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#15:1:A>
He plans to sue the Government in the next two days for
infringement of his personal freedom should the police not go away <O> report

Bosnian Serbs are voting in their second and final day of the
referendum on the UN peace plan

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#25:1:A>

irrelevant

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#27:1:A>
More on that from CBS News <O> report by Cinny Kenard from CBS News

The US-manufactured satellite was lifted into orbit on board a long
march rocket this morning

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#30:1:A>
It was the second <?> huge </?> satellite to be put in orbit since
the explosion of a long march rocket carrying another satellite last April

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#31:1:A>

The Commissioner for Police Eddie Hui has cautioned that
police staff groups should be careful about what they say in public

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#34:1:A>
His comments came after a local police association indicated it
will talk to China  ' s advisors on transitional issues about reinstating the
death penalty after nineteen ninety-seven

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#35:1:A>
The Police Commissioner has sent a letter to the Association
condemning its move

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#36:1:A>
He says the letter is not intended to interfere with the
Association  ' s freedom of speech but he cautioned there are limits to what
police officers can say in public

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#37:1:A>
Meanwhile Hui will head for Guangdong on invitation <,> of the
Public Security Bureau to discuss future cooperation <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#38:1:A>
Tough new laws on animal waste disposal is forcing some Hong Kong
farmers out of business

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#39:1:A>
They say sewage treatment is not only costly but may not be
effective

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#40:1:A>
Kam Suk  ' s family has been farming in the New Territories for three
generations

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#41:1:A>
His farm like around two thousand others in Hong Kong pump out raw
sewage

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#42:1:A>
New laws which came to effect in July means Kam Suk has to cut the
pollution by about fifty times

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#43:1:A>
The waste treatment equipment will cost him at least eight hundred
thousand dollars <O> speech in Cantonese by Kam Suk </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#44:1:A>
But the Government says they have been especially lenient to the
farmers already

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#45:1:A>
They have three years to bring their farms in line with the law

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#46:1:A>
But industries for example don't get such a long grace period to
comply with similar environmental requirements

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#X47:1:Z>
Alternative is they can get a loan or a capital grant from the
government in installing this treatment facility </X>

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#48:1:Z>
The fine is fifty thousand dollars for failure to keep up with the
new standard

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#49:1:Z>
Kam Suk can't afford to pay up should the sewage treatment not work

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#50:1:Z>
So for him the only answer is closing down the farm <,> and for
Hong Kong the beginning of the end of the traditional way of life

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#51:1:Z>
The contract to build the Tsang Yi Interchange has been awarded to
a Sino-Japanese joint venture company

Reports say the US and its Gulf War allies have agreed to hand
Baghdad an ultimatum

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#74:2:B>
It would give Iraq a few days to back down in its confrontation
with UN weapons inspectors or face possible military action probably an
allied bombing raid

Statistics just released make it clear that foreign investors  ' 
confidence in China has rebounded from the dramatic slump in the aftermath of
the June Fourth Crackdown in nineteen eighty-nine <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#88:2:A>
Government figures released at a news conference in Beijing today

Most foreign money is going into manufacturing and real estate
development

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#92:2:A>
It was noted that foreign investors scared off by the June Fourth
Crackdown have been encouraged by China  ' s reported double digit GNP growth
and new official promises to facilitate the sale of foreign products inside
China

Hong Kong-born and Oxford-educated fifty-eight-year-old Henry

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#111:2:A>
During that time he has worn many other hats within the legal
system including that of Deputy High Court Judge and in public service
sitting on a variety of boards and committees

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#112:2:A>
He ran unsuccessfully for the legal functional constituency seat
in nineteen eighty-five and in nineteen eighty-seven was appointed legal
advisor to the Basic Law Consultative Committee

<ICE-HK:S2B-014#113:2:A>
In March this year he was one of forty-four Hong Kong people
