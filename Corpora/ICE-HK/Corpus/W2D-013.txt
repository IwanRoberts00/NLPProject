<bold> STAYING AWAY FROM </bold> home used to be a trial for
Coffee , but not any more .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#5:1>
Not since he discovered the pleasures of holiday-style accommodation
in Mongkok offering air-conditioned rooms with comfy beds , cotton towels and
filtered jazz , plus 24-hour service , a beauty parlour and two square meals
a day .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#6:1>
How does he express his pleasure at such luxury ?

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#7:1>
He wags his tail . </p>

Welcome to <it> Dogotel </it> , Hong Kong  ' s first deluxe indoor
lodge catering exclusively to man  ' s best friend .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#9:1>
Opened in November last year in a residential block in Argyle Street ,
the hotel is spread over two floors and 6,000 square feet , has 24
glass-walled rooms &obrack;  so residents can eyeball each other &cbrack; and boasts an
indoor garden equipped with sand boxes , benches , flower pots and traffic
cones - not to divert vehicles , mind , but to encourage guests to relieve
themselves .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#10:1>
It is in this compound that staff exercise and play with the dogs and
keep them happy .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#11:1>
That , after all , is the reason Sisse Pang Chui-sze opened Dogotel:
to ensure mutts have a good time while their owners are away . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#12:1>
&ldquo; Whenever I went overseas , I had to beg my family and friends
to care for my dogs, &rdquo;  the 32-year-old entrepreneur says .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#13:1>
&ldquo; I had seen many kennels overseas , such as in New York , and
always wondered why Hong Kong didn't have similar facilities. &rdquo;  </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#14:1>
So , like their canine counterparts in the West , Hong Kong dogs
can now look forward to OTT <indig> tai-tai </indig> treatment .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#15:1>
For those who simply can't bear the thought of roughing it on the
floor , there are specially designed beds to ensure good support and a full
night  ' s sleep .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#16:1>
Those too excited to drift off but in need of their beauty sleep can &ldquo; request &rdquo; chill-out music: anything from New Age rainforest sounds to
middle-of-the-road jazz .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#17:1>
A bit of primping also doesn't go astray .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#18:1>
To look their best - a must in new company - dogs can have their hair
styled in the latest fashion , be it poodle puff-balls or straight bangs ,
china-doll style . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#19:1>
Seeing a niche in the market , and despite having no experience
in animal care &obrack;  apart from knowledge gained through books &cbrack; , Pang quit her
job as a personal secretary at a fashion house and , with the help of family
and friends , invested more than &dollar;1 million in the venture .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#20:1>
Some of the money went into hi-tech extras such as ultrasonic
silencers that emit a high-pitched sound that , apparently , calms down
excitable , small yappers &obrack;  the technology doesn't yet work on big dogs &cbrack; .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#21:1>
Her efforts were rewarded .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#22:1>
Rooms were full throughout Christmas and the Lunar New Year ,
although , with most people back home from their holidays , only one-third of
rooms were occupied during a recent weekday .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#23:1>
Overall , however , income from boarding amounts to only 20 per cent
of turnover , the shop on the top floor bringing in 40 per cent and grooming
services much of the rest . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#24:1>
Pang runs Dogotel with the help of her sister , registered nurse
Julie Pang Tsui-yee , and five PR agents - in the furry forms of Pomeranians
Bubble and Max , poodle Ted , lhasa apso Bebe andYorkshire terrier Suki .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#25:1>
The four-legged assistants help entertain guests , among them
12-year-old Max and seven-year-old Moey , both golden retrievers .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#26:1>
Max and Moey , on their third visit in as many months , make the
short trip from their home in Hunghom whenever Patrick Boyle and his wife ,
Bessie Pang Boyle , pop across the border to Shenzhen to see relatives . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#27:1>
&ldquo; You can sense they  ' re very comfortable here , and well taken
care of , so now I don't feel worried, &rdquo;  Patrick Boyle says . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#28:1>
Basanna Lo Lai-ching feels the same way , and is relieved she no
longer has to deposit her two-year-old Jack Russell terrier at a friend  ' s
home or neighbourhood pet shops when she goes away .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#29:1>
&ldquo; I felt heartbroken leaving her in a tiny cage, &rdquo;  Lo says , adding
that on two occasions her dog picked up a skin infection and developed a
fever because of what she believes to be unsanitary conditions at some shops .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#30:1>
At <it> Dogotel </it> , hygiene appears to be a priority ,
although , unlike many other boarding houses , dogs are allowed to fraternise
because , as Pang says , &ldquo; they are sociable animals &rdquo;  .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#31:1>
Canine guests are inspected upon arrival to ensure they are free of
fleas and other health problems , and have proof of relevant vaccinations .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#32:1>
Sleeping areas are fitted with air purifiers and industrial-strength
fans to remove hair and dirt .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#33:1>
And waste is removed frequently throughout the day , with urine going
straight through the sieve-like floor into drains below .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#34:1>
Bowls are sterilised before use and beds are changed daily . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#35:1>
However , this kind of service comes at a price .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#36:1>
A 12-sq-ft room costs &dollar;180 a night while &ldquo; suites &rdquo;  are
&dollar;280 a night , with discounts offered for extended stays .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#37:1>
Then there are the extras: a shampoo and blow-dry , for instance ,
costs between &dollar;150 and &dollar;550 , while a hairdo can cost anywhere
from &dollar;250 to &dollar;750 .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#38:1>
In comparison , a typical boarding fee at a kennel ranges from
&dollar;55 to &dollar;135 a day , or &dollar;80 to &dollar;100 at pet stores
, where a wash is typically in the &dollar;90 to &dollar;200 range .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#39:1>
The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , meanwhile ,
charges &dollar;95 to &dollar;145 for boarding at its Wan Chai kennel , which
has a 24-hour in-house vet &obrack;  unlike Dogotel , which calls them in when
required &cbrack; as well as an indoor playground . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#40:1>
The comparatively high costs are worth it for Vivien Cheung
Tsz-man .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#41:1>
Before she discovered Dogotel , the general manager of a printing
company eschewed holidays because she didn't want to leave Ah Sa , her
six-month-old schnauzer , behind .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#42:1>
Now , she says , it seems Ah Sa doesn't want to return home when she
goes to collect her from Dogotel .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#43:1>
&ldquo; She resists , pushing her feet against the door, &rdquo;  Cheung says ,
laughing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#44:1>
Coffee understands why .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#45:1>
The nine-month-old basenji , who used to be left with friends when
his owner travelled , lies comfortably on his bed , enjoying the cool ,
conditioned air .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#46:1>
Soon it will be play time , perhaps a special hairstyle and later
dinner and another lie down .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#47:1>
Who could blame him if , after a week  ' s stay , he too doesn't feel
like leaving ?

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#48:1>
If this is a dog  ' s life , he could certainly do with more . </p>

<O> Picture </O> <h><bold> Creepy-crawly cuisine </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#50:2>
Pest controllers , the Lee family , love their work so much they
happily lap up the bugs they find: fired , boiled or row .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#51:2>
<bold> Sherry Lee </bold> digs in - to the story , that is </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#52:2>
<bold> WHEN PEST </bold> controller Lee Yuet-keung takes his work
home with him , his wife wouldn't be more thrilled . for in the Lee household
, there  ' s nothing more delicious than a <it> <foreign> cop-totermes
formosanus </foreign> </it> omelette . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#53:2>
Lee isn't your ordinary pest controller .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#54:2>
And Lee family dinners aren't your normal meals .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#55:2>
Whether it is lashings of dead termites lacing soups and congee ,
sumptuous semi-conscious bugs liberally sprinkled on salads or mixed with
rice , or little critters steamed or fried soup succulent pork spare ribs - a
gastronomic reward comes from a hard day  ' s graft by the Lees . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#56:2>
&ldquo; They taste like shrimps; they are fresh , sweet and
nutritious ,  &rdquo; enthuses Lee , 58 .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#57:2>
&ldquo; I soak them in water first , filter them out , put them on a
plate and dip them in soy sauce or salt with sesame oil .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#58:2>
Sometimes they bite my tongue , so I use my teeth or fingers to crush
them to death .  &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#59:2>
The Lees feast on all kinds of termites - but for sheer taste it
just has to be <it> <foreign> coptoter-mes formosanus </foreign> </it> ,
sometimes , ignorantly , called a white ant .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#60:2>
The most common of several dozen types of Hong Kong termite , this
particular species makes for particularly good banquets in the Lee  ' s
household in Wong Tai Sin . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#61:2>
Caterpillars may be a delicacy in Mexico , <foreign> witchetty
</foreign> grubs in Australia  ' s Outback , and locusts the preserve of many a
mainlander , but in Chuk Yuen South Estate , the <it> <foreign> cop-totermes
formosanus </foreign> </it> is king .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#62:2>
Well , actually , Lee Yuet-keung is king-the self-styled &ldquo;
termite king" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#63:2>
Lee was destined to become a pest controller from his very first
mouthful of termites as a baby in his family  ' s Huiyang village in Guangdong .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#64:2>
&ldquo; I don't know when it first started , but I do know that in my
great-grandfather  ' s time , my ancestors had already eating termites ,
 &rdquo; he says . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#65:2>
The family kept their habit a secret from fellow villagers ,
fearing they would be ridiculed-and that others would scoff their supply .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#66:2>
But at home , they would eat several thousand termites each day .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#67:2>
&ldquo; My mum would put half a bowl of termites into my congee
for me ,  &rdquo; Lee reminisces .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#68:2>
&ldquo; My parents told me termites were nutritious .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#69:2>
Some of my siblings wouldn't eat them .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#70:2>
They found them disgusting , but I loved them .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#71:2>
I thought that when I got older , I would go to hunt them myself .
 &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#72:2>
Today , Lee and two of his three sons , Foo-wah , 20 , and
Chun-yip , 18 , make up the Tung Sang Company , which specialises in
eradicating premises of the litter menaces , which can cause havoc by
feasting on wood , carpets and fabric .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#73:2>
On finding a nest - made from the termites ' droppings and saliva -
the Lees first secure their dinner then destroy the remainder with pesticide .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#74:2>
&ldquo; When people aren't looking , I quickly put the termites into
a plastic bag ,  &rdquo; Lee says . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#75:2>
Lee , his wife Lam Kin-nam , and all three sons , including
student Fu-wing , 21 , tuck in at home to the daily catch , although Lam
recalls being less than bowled over by the prospect when the couple first met .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#76:2>
Love , however , won out .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#77:2>
&ldquo; He said the termites were fat and very nutritious and asked
me to try some ,  &rdquo; Lam , 45 , recalls .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#78:2>
&ldquo; It was delicious , just like the taste of meat .  &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#79:2>
Foo-wah has eaten the bugs since he was a baby , but didn't tell
his mates for fear they would think him a little odd .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#80:2>
Eventually though , they found out .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#81:2>
&ldquo; They all thought I was strange , but some said they wanted to
try , so I brought them home for a termites meal .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#82:2>
At the table , no one dared to start eating .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#83:2>
Then one began to eat and they all followed .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#84:2>
They all said the termites were delicious .  &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#85:2>
Foo-wah favours his termites fired; for Chun-yip , it has to be
bug omelette .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#86:2>
And just for those occasions in the colder , drier months when
termites are harder to find , the family breeds them at home for a ready
supply . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#87:2>
But for the entire family , the insects aren't just the spice of
dinners , but the stuff of dreams .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#88:2>
&ldquo; In one dream , I stole my brother  ' s plate of termites ,
 &rdquo; Chun-yip recalls .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#89:2>
His father , with an embarrassed smile , admits one of his recurring
dreams is that he is searching a house for a nest without success .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#90:2>
For him it  ' s the stuff of nightmares - the frightening prospect of a
bland family dinner . </p>

<bold> WHAT  ' s IN A TERMITE ? </bold> </h> <O> A picture </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#95:2>
There is no research in Hong Kong on termites ' nutritional value
, but according to a study By Darna Dufour , an entomologist at the
University of Colorado in the United States , Amazonian termites have a
higher protein value than dried fish , and a nutritional value that rivals
pork sausage and goose liver . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#96:2>
Locally , nutrition consultant Miranda Wong Yuk-sin says like
other insects , termites are high in protein , low in fat and
cholesterol-free . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#97:2>
Geraldine Ng , chairman of the Hong Kong Dieticians Association ,
agrees , but says because of their small sizes - the <it> <foreign>
coptotermes formosanus </foreign> </it> is about the size of a common ant -
people need to eat many of them to get any nutritional benefit . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#98:2>
So should we eat them ?

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#99:2>
Dr Edmund Li Tsze-shing , associate professor in nutrition at the
University of Hong Kong  ' s department of zoology , says &ldquo; an exotic
dish occasionally is okay" , but habitual consumption may be problematic .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#100:2>
&ldquo; I wouldn't suggest people eat them regularly until we know
more about the termites and what is inside them .  &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#101:2>
However , Wong says people from all over the world have a long
tradition of eating various types of insects and daily consumption should
pose no problem , as long s they are clean . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#102:2>
We asked South China Morning Post food editor , Susan Jung , to
put the termites to the taste test .

<ICE-HK:W2D-013#103:2>
But after seeing the magnified photo above , she declared: &ldquo;
Sorry , I  ' m not eating termite sashimi !  &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-013#104:2>
Fair enough . </p>
