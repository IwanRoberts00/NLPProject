submission form okay on which AP two raped the victim </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#162:2:A>
<?> Beside </?>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X163:2:Z>
Okay I only received one </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#164:2:A>
Yes

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X165:2:Z>
And that was an item marked eight </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#166:2:A>
Yes

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X167:2:Z>
And as described in the police submission form it was a bed sheet
seized from the bed on which AP two raped the victim </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#168:2:A>
I see

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#169:2:A>
And can you tell which from which area of the bed sheet that you
have this <.> hu </.> human spermatozoa

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X170:2:Z>
Well it  ' s very difficult to particularly name an area on a bed
sheet because you would understand and I  ' d be appreciate that there is no
particular reference but I have made a drawing here uh if you would allow me
okay it is this is the bed sheet as laid out and it  ' s on here okay </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#171:2:A>
Yes

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X172:2:Z>
I mean </X>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X173:2:Z>
Yes we can see that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#174:2:A>
Thank you

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#175:2:A>
Now you told us that you cannot determine the source of this
spermatozoa can you tell us the age of it

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X176:2:Z>
No </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#177:2:A>
You can't

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X178:2:Z>
No </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#179:2:A>
It could have been there for a long time

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X180:2:Z>
<{> <[> Well </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#181:2:A>
<[> Before </[> </{> you re-examined it

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X182:2:Z>
Yes it could it could </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#183:2:A>
It could have been there for a long time

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X184:2:Z>
Yes there is no way of telling the age of a stain </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#185:2:A>
Once the bed sheet is stained the stain stays there <.> un
</.> <{> <[> unless </[>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X186:2:Z>
<[> Unless </[> </{> it has been washed <unc> two words
</unc> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#187:2:A>
Yeah <&> A long pause </&>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#188:2:B>
Thank you uh Doctor <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#189:2:B>
Now of the sixty one items that were sent to you for examination
<,> only about twelve items had in fact been examined

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X190:2:Z>
Yes uh <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X191:2:Z>
Yes twelve </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#192:2:B>
And you  ' ve already told us <,> uh insofar as the clothings
of the three males concerned that had not been examined

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#193:2:B>
You  ' ve given a very long reason but do I take it <,> that the
reason why they had not been examined is because it  ' s impossible to look for
vaginal secretion on a male clothing as a link

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#194:2:B>
Can I summarise your long answer uhm in this way

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X195:2:Z>
Uhm it  ' s well first of all it  ' s almost impossible okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X196:2:Z>
I  ' m not saying it  ' s definitely impossible </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#197:2:B>
Right <{> <[> fine </[>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X198:2:Z>
<[> It  ' s </[> </{> very remote that we can positively identify
or positively uhm individualise <.> se </.> vaginal secretions on uh clothing
items

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X199:2:Z>
That  ' s why it is not a common practice </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#200:2:B>
So basically basically the non-examination so to speak is
because uh of of the remote possibility of matching vaginal secretion to to
the male by examining the clothings

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X201:2:Z>
Yes <{> <[> Yes </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#202:2:B>
<[> Is that </[> </{> right

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X203:2:Z>
<{> <[> Yes </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#204:2:B>
<[> Is </[> </{> that be fair

<$Z1  <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X205:2:Z>
That  ' s okay I  ' ll <{> <[> take </[> that one </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#206:2:B>
<[> Thank </[> </{> thank you

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#207:2:B>
But uh Doctor <,> there are more than one purposes for you the
clothings to be sent over to you for examination

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X208:2:Z>
Meaning </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#209:2:B>
Meaning <,> you know one of the purposes in the examination
is to search for the presence of stains

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X210:2:Z>
Excuse <{> <[> me </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#211:2:B>
<[> Of </[> </{> <.> hu </.> it  ' s all right I repeat it

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X212:2:Z>
I  ' m <.> sor </.> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#213:2:B>
<{> <[> That  ' s </[> fine

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#214:2:B>
Now one of the purposes of the examination is to search for the
presence of stains of human seminal material or blood on the other item would
you agree

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X215:2:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X216:2:Z>
Yes yes </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#217:2:B>
So <,> uh by examining the clothings you might be able to
detect presence of stain of human seminal material like sperm

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#218:2:B>
Would would would would that be fair to say

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X219:2:Z>
Yes that would

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X220:2:Z>
But there again I didn't think that it was relevant

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X221:2:Z>
Or at the time uhm I have spoken with uh Inspector Wong of the
who was in charge of the case we didn't think it was valid it would have been
irrelevant that  ' s why it wasn't done </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#222:2:B>
But it would be relevant uh would it not uhm for example let  ' s
let  ' s be more specific about this

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#223:2:B>
The under pant of uh <,> Chinese male Law <,> uh that would be of
great significance and relevance <,> bearing in mind <,> the allegation of
sexual intercourse <,> do you agree

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X224:2:Z>
Well in retrospect may be but at the time uhm we didn't <.> o
</.> we obviously didn't think it would be relevant I mean because we have
had a lot of experience with people those easily explaining away for stains
on their under clothing </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#225:2:B>
You <,> Doctor <,> if you had examined the pair of under pant
of this particular Chinese male <,> the chances are you might be able to
detect human seminal material <,> on it

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X226:2:Z>
Yes I  ' m not ruling that out

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X227:2:Z>
Yes that could have been </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#228:2:B>
In fact in other cases of rape which you were involved as the
forensic scientist <,> the under pant of a suspect would be examined

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X229:2:Z>
You  ' d be surprised no uh not as a rule </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#230:2:B>
Not as a rule

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X231:2:Z>
No </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#232:2:B>
Uh let  ' s move on to another items

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#233:2:B>
Now you  ' ve uhm included on your list of examination twelve items

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#234:2:B>
Already told us blood saliva samples <unc> one word </unc>
et cetera

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#235:2:B>
Now <,> on forensic scientist  ' s view <,> it would appear Doctor
that after the after Madam Lam had been to the doctor and after these three
young men had been to the doctors uhm <,> vaginal swabs and penile swab were
also obtained <,> from these various people do you agree <&> A long pause
</&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X236:2:Z>
Yes that  ' s right </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#237:2:B>
Thank you

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#238:2:B>
Now I don't see these items on your list of items that you had
examined

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#239:2:B>
Well take it that these items had not been examined will you

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X240:2:Z>
Yes that  ' s right </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#241:2:B>
Wouldn't these items be of particular importance in the
examination in the light of this case

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X242:2:Z>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X243:2:Z>
Concerning the vagina  ' s uh swabs of the female Lam it was her
own allegation that she had bathed herself since the incident uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X244:2:Z>
Yes and uh there again our experience comes in

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X245:2:Z>
It  ' s very remotely that uhm we can find anything since bathing

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X246:2:Z>
I mean with washing there will be very little chance of semen
left in her vagina </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#247:2:B>
You would agree with me sure Doctor that even though there
had been washing <,> especially if ejaculation was inside <,> uh the vagina
<,> there is still a chance uh not necessarily a slim chance of detecting <,>
semen

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X248:2:Z>
Yes there is a slim chance <{> <[> yes </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#249:2:B>
<[> All </[> </{> right

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#250:2:B>
And washing really all depends on how thorough the wash might be

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X251:2:Z>
That  ' s true too <{> <[> I mean at </[> the extend of the okay
yes </X>

<$B1> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#252:2:B>
<[> True too </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#253:2:B>
Right and basically the purpose in obtaining the vaginal swabs
from her and that to be handed over to you <,> is for you to examine as you  ' ve
set out in the purposes of your examination <,> to search for the presence of
stains of <.> s </.> human seminal material

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X254:2:Z>
Yes that  ' s true </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#255:2:B>
So Madam Doctor sorry you are basically telling us that that
was overlooked

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X256:2:Z>
No I have considered it and we thought it wouldn't be relevant
because chances of getting a positive result is very remote

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X257:2:Z>
And even if there if we did get any <,> weak response for uh
presence of semen I mean with my experience from my experience anyway chances
of grouping it is so remote that is not worth it </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#258:2:B>
Don't worry about grouping

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#259:2:B>
Grouping you  ' re actually going or attempting to identify the
source

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X260:2:Z>
Yes </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#261:2:B>
All right

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#262:2:B>
But one is really talking of the grouping is only one of the
purposes of your examination is that right

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X263:2:Z>
Yes </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#264:2:B>
The other equally important purpose is of course the presence
to detect presence of such material <,> must be right

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X265:2:Z>
Well uhm I can't say that they are of equally of equal importance

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X266:2:Z>
I mean as far as I concern anyway I I I can't I don't see the
matter from the legal point of view as you do but <,> as far as I can see
they are not of equal importance </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#267:2:B>
What about uhm <,> penile swabs

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X268:2:Z>
Uhm there <{> <[> again </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#269:2:B>
<[> Did </[> </{> you conduct examinations

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X270:2:Z>
No because if I am at the as I explained lately earlier on
detection of its vagina  ' s secretions even on clothing item is very difficult

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X271:2:Z>
I  ' m not to say penile swab which is really uh swab are very
localised area

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X272:2:Z>
And uh </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#273:2:B>
You are talking

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X274:2:Z>
No just hold on please <,,> yes </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#275:2:B>
You are once again talking about linking or grouping <,>
right

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X276:2:Z>
Establishing a link between the female and male parties is not
the case </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#277:2:B>
I  ' m obviously more concerned about the presence of semen

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#278:2:B>
If you had conducted an examination on the penile swabs <,>
delivered to you which belonged to uh Chinese male Law <,> you would or might
be able to detect presence of semen

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X279:2:Z>
I might <O> unidentified speech </O> but there again the same
goes I mean the same <,> the same reasoning as the uhm as I have <unc>
one-word </unc> for the clothing items goals for the penile swabs </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#280:2:B>
You  ' ve told us the meaning of <.> secre </.> a secretor

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#281:2:B>
That is a person <,> would be expected to posses appreciable
quantity of their blood group substance in the other body fluids such as
semen

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X282:2:Z>
Yes </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#283:2:B>
Appreciable quantity you are actually talking about <,> uhm
larger quantity

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X284:2:Z>
Measurable <{> <[> quantities </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#285:2:B>
<[> Measurable </[> </{> quantity

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#286:2:B>
So is be a lot easier to detect <,> the existence or non-existence
of such substance <,> do it

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X287:2:Z>
Uh easier is a very relative word right </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#288:2:B>
<{> <[> So </[> it  ' s helpless

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X289:2:Z>
<[> <.> Easi </.> </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X290:2:Z>
No what okay okay a non-secretor  ' s let  ' s let me put in this way
okay a non-secretor is almost impossible <,> if you want a comparison then
that  ' s what I will say

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X291:2:Z>
For non-secretor is is almost well is very very <.> re </.>
difficult because <,> the substances are just not there for measuring </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#292:2:B>
Right

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#293:2:B>
Your Honour <?> waste too much work of it </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#294:2:B>
Now basically of the items that you have examined there is only
two strand of hairs that might be attributable <.> at </.> attributable to
Chinese male Law

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X295:2:Z>
Well only one of the two </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#296:2:B>
Only one of the two

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X297:2:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#298:2:B>
<?> Nothing </?> very much

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#299:2:B>
And if only that he might only be

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X300:2:Z>
Excuse me I  ' m sorry <,,> yeah </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#301:2:B>
One out of three who might have possessed or the donor of
such hair strand of hair

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X302:2:Z>
Yes that  ' s true </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#303:2:B>
So basically you can't link any of these three young men uhm
uh to the victim of this case Madam Lam

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X304:2:Z>
No well no not personally </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#305:2:B>
Not through the examination

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X306:2:Z>
Well except for that piece of hair <{> <[> again there  ' s no
solid </[> evidence anyway okay </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#307:2:B>
<[> Except that piece of </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#308:2:B>
And uh <,> you after you  ' ve done your examination there is no
finding of any presence uhm of semen attributable to these three young men

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X309:2:Z>
No </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#310:2:B>
Thank you <&> A long pause </&>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#311:2:C>
Sorry <O> unidentified sounds </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#312:2:C>
Yes officer you said you did not examine the penile swabs for
vaginal secretion because chances of finding <,> such secretion would be even
less than chances of finding such secretion on the clothings of the three men

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#313:2:C>
Is that not right

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#314:2:C>
That  ' s what you said

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X315:2:Z>
Is that what I said </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#316:2:C>
Yes

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X317:2:Z>
Okay </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#318:2:C>
Because you said it it was of a local area therefore chances
were <,> smaller

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X319:2:Z>
Okay uh that would have been said uhm in relation to the under
pants that I mean yah more or less </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#320:2:C>
I see

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X321:2:Z>
Of whose <{> <[> of the </[> </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#322:2:C>
<[> I </[> </{> think uh learned friend there just asked you
why you did not examine the penile swabs and that was the explanation you
gave

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X323:2:Z>
Okay </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#324:2:C>
Perhaps so

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#325:2:C>
Why wasn't the penile swabs examined

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X326:2:Z>
Because uhm <,> like I explained for <.> s </.> the <.> vagi </.>
uh difficulties with vaginal secretions it is very difficult firstly to <.>
conclu </.> conclusively say that there is vaginal secretion and secondly

I see

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#328:2:C>
So the whole purpose of <,> of seizing the clothing sending the
swabs to you would <,> would have been useless because you would say in
normal situation almost impossible to have any examination on these items to
prove whatever you want to prove

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X329:2:Z>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X330:2:Z>
The clothings were sent the clothing items were sent with a note
saying that uhm there was uh <,> a request for examine uh for establishing
contact evidence <{> <[> between </[> the AP of the males and the female
party

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X331:2:Z>
And of course clothing items sent to the lab could have been done
for that purpose

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X332:2:Z>
Not necessarily only for identifying body fluids </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-069#333:2:C>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#334:2:C>
Yes besides that Doctor <,> and in fact despite all these items
being sent to the lab you haven't even establish contact evidence from these
items

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#335:2:C>
There is no contact evidence whatsoever

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-069#X336:2:Z>
I  ' m not sure about that because contact evidence could be in the
form of fibre transfer and that is not not that is not what I do in the lab
</X> </I>
