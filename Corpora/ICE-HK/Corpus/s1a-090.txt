the student uh say

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X43:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#44:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#46:1:A>
Yeah <{> <[> something like that </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#47:1:A>
Yeah so but after you have uh said something

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#48:1:A>
He always uh say <,> uh good good very good

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#49:1:A>
Yeah so <,> that  ' s terrible

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X50:1:Z>
<[> <unc> three words </unc> </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X51:1:Z>
So how long would you be <,> would you be going to Russia if you
<{> <[> went </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#52:1:A>
<[> Uh </[> </{> four weeks

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X53:1:Z>
Four weeks

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X54:1:Z>
Just a bit time

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X55:1:Z>
Just like a lecture on History <,> <{> <[> <unc> one-word
</unc> history <unc> one- word </unc> </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#56:1:A>
<[> Uh no </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#57:1:A>
Not only on History but also Art uhm <,> culture <{> <[> <,> </[>
and some on politics I think

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X58:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X59:1:Z>
What about Russian

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X60:1:Z>
Begin to learn Russian </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#61:1:A>
Yeah he said that uh <,> <?> the </?> there will be a class uh
teaching us some terms some usual terms uh in Russia

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#62:1:A>
<{1> <[1> But </[1> I think that uh Russian is a very difficult
language <{2> <[2> is it </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X63:1:Z>
<[1> Oh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X64:1:Z>
<[2> Oh it has </[2> </{2> different

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X65:1:Z>
It has different alphabet so you have

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X66:1:Z>
I have some friends who study Russian <{1> <[1> and </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X67:1:Z>
It  ' s a whole different alphabet so you have to <,> get that

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X68:1:Z>
But as soon as you get the alphabet right

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X69:1:Z>
It  ' s not too hard to <,> read and

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X70:1:Z>
I don't know but it  ' s pretty interesting

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X71:1:Z>
But there  ' s no language in four weeks is only got enough

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X72:1:Z>
But and if you  ' ve got class in the morning <,> to learn then

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X73:1:Z>
It  ' s <{2> <[2> it is </[2> enough to get around in the street

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X74:1:Z>
Is like that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#75:1:A>
<[1> Uh ha </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#76:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#77:1:A>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#78:1:A>
<{1> <[1> Actually I  ' m </[1> <,> I think they <,> are not intended
to <{2> <[2> <,> teach </[2> us Russian <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#79:1:A>
They just uh let us know some terms <{4> <[4> so that </[4> we can
uh for example uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#80:1:A>
In the railway station we can notice <{5> <[5> some </[5> words and
won't get loss

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X81:1:Z>
<[1> <unc> two-words </unc> </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X82:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X83:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X84:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X85:1:Z>
<[5> Yes </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X86:1:Z>
Yes okay

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X87:1:Z>
Just getting around the in <,> in the countries

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X88:1:Z>
It  ' s very important to know at least a few words

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X89:1:Z>
Otherwise if you go into place and you know the language </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#90:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X91:1:Z>
So <,> it should be good </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#92:1:A>
Uhm uhm <&>

<$Z> laughs </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#93:1:Z>
And Russia uh <,> I don't know

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#94:1:Z>
Because why <,> I really want to go there because

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#95:1:Z>
I think that is <,> rather quite dangerous if I go <,> there by
myself

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#96:1:Z>
<{1> <[1> I  ' m </[1> not sure because of its political unrest <{2>
<[2> uh </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X97:1:Z>
<[1> Oh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X98:1:Z>
<[2> Thinking </[2> </{2> by yourself because I want to really
know where to go apart from Moscow to <.> Pe </.> St. Petersburg <{1> <[1>
<unc> three words </unc> </[1> <&>

<$A> laughs </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X99:1:A>
<{2> <[2> I don't </[2> know I don't know what is like in the rest
of the country

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X100:1:A>
But it is getting poorer and poorer and all

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X101:1:A>
All the stories you hear about <?> mafia </?> and uh <,> and just

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X102:1:A>
Just because it  ' s poor

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X103:1:A>
<{3> <[3> I even </[3> don't know if you <,> would enjoy it by
yourself

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X104:1:A>
And <,> just <unc> two-words </unc> hard to get along

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X105:1:A>
But if you go people must in your

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X106:1:A>
It  ' s organized by someone

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X107:1:A>
Then I can be <unc> one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X108:1:A>
Do you know other people who want to go with you </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#109:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#110:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#111:1:A>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#112:1:A>
No

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X113:1:Z>
No </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#114:1:A>
No

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X115:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#116:1:A>
Not a single yeah <,> not sure

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#117:1:A>
Cause because uhm I like Russian history

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#118:1:A>
Uh <,> <unc> one-word </unc> I want to go there and have a
look

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#119:1:A>
To see how it  ' s <,> how it  ' s how <,> does it look

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X120:1:Z>
Oh what  ' s interesting about Russian history

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X121:1:Z>
We know it isn't

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X122:1:Z>
But what what do you find interest about Russian history </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#123:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#124:1:A>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#125:1:A>
I  ' m fantasized by the uhm Russian revolutionary intelligentsia
<{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#126:1:A>
Uh there are <,> there are different uh <,> there were different
uh generations

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#127:1:A>
And they held different idea but <,> uhm they work very hard uhm
<,> to make uh Russia Russia better

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#128:1:A>
But <,> uh finally when the revolution uh came

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#129:1:A>
The revolution destroyed them

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X130:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X131:1:Z>
Oh yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#132:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#133:1:A>
I want to <,> I want to study more about uhm the contradiction
within uhm those intelligentsia

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#134:1:A>
And I think if I can go to Russia <,> and really have a look uh at
those museums and <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#135:1:A>
Yeah it  ' s uh just like bringing me bringing me back <,> to
nineteenth century <&>

<$Z> laughs </&> in

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X136:1:Z>
But you can </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#137:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X138:1:Z>
I think we don't understand what to went there

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X139:1:Z>
But then again now the situation has changed very much

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X140:1:Z>
I don't know how much is left before those <{> <[> revolutionary
</[> days </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#141:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#142:1:A>
Yeah <,> that  ' s true

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X143:1:Z>
Yeah it  ' s really sad those in Russia at this moment

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X144:1:Z>
<{1> <[1> I think </[1> politically so I have to <?> understood
</?> anything because <,> <{2> <[2> uh </[2> <&> All speakers laugh </&> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X145:1:Z>
A bit frightening </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#146:1:A>
<[1> Right </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#147:1:A>
<[2> Me neither </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#148:1:A>
Yeah I  ' m a bit worry about the new president

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#149:1:A>
Because he  ' s a <,> secret police in the past

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X150:1:Z>
Oh yes that  ' s right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#151:1:A>
Yeah <{> <[> that  ' s </[> terrible

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#152:1:A>
I uh I afraid that Russia will <,> he will became uh become
another Stalin <&>

<$Z> laughs </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#153:1:Z>
<unc> three words </unc>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X154:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X155:1:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X156:1:Z>
And there was a <unc> one-word </unc> that he cannot got
elected because of uhm that war with uhm <,> Chechnya

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X157:1:Z>
Is that how you <{1> <[1> you say it Chechnya </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X158:1:Z>
And <,> yeah I thought you you you know this story about how <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X159:1:Z>
The fact that how he got to power <?> raging </?> this force
which is cannot <,> <unc> two-words </unc> it  ' s stupid

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X160:1:Z>
I don't know maybe I haven't got the whole version of it

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X161:1:Z>
But it doesn't seem like very fair war

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X162:1:Z>
He  ' s <{2> <[2> confess </[2> that because he want to <?> rage
</?> that war

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X163:1:Z>
<{3> <[3> And </[3> <,> and like he  ' s reading all these reports
about how Russia being very <{4> <[4> successful </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X164:1:Z>
It has a few <?> riot </?>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X165:1:Z>
Actually like <,> it has been continued very very long time <{5>
<[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X166:1:Z>
And <,> it  ' s loyal to tell a president

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X167:1:Z>
Okay I  ' ve not what I heard is he  ' s has been elected just for
that issue <{6> <[6> <,> </[6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X168:1:Z>
And now like what he what he he what he  ' ll do for the rest of
the economy and Russian <{7> <[7> politics </[7> you don't know </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#169:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X217:1:Z>
But I heard that there  ' s nothing much to see not a great
interest

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X218:1:Z>
As to go as a tourist it  ' s not much to do <{> <[> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X219:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#221:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#222:1:A>
Because uhm usually most of my friends uhm go there

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#223:1:A>
Just for uh eating those uh Taiwan food

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X224:1:Z>

</[2> food <{3> <[3> yeah </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#230:1:A>
Because uhm <,> I think uh they are not interested

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#231:1:A>
Uh me too not interested in those <,> uh <.> na </.> uh park parks

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X232:1:Z>

Would it  ' s just a kind of why I I want to go there to study

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X239:1:Z>
Because <,> it won't be like I  ' m visiting <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X240:1:Z>
If I go there to visit then probably I won't very much <{2> <[2>
do

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X241:1:Z>
But </[2> if I go to live for a month or <,> or two months

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X242:1:Z>
I like to I can spend two months over there

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X243:1:Z>
Then I should live there two month

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X244:1:Z>
Then I can understand how the country works and works

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X245:1:Z>
Like to live over there <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X246:1:Z>
And I  ' ll have enough to do in my spare time without <,> trying
to look for something to see

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X247:1:Z>
But yeah as far for eating and I also love all these <,> uh local
coffee places

lot of money

<{1> <[1> It </[1> stops people people from coming in but so
strange

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X500:1:Z>
Cause it  ' s <{2> <[2> supposed to be the same country </[2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#501:1:A>
<[`> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#502:1:A>

<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X506:1:Z>
Well <unc> one-word </unc> from Hong Kong to China yeah
like

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X507:1:Z>
It  ' s normal because you you want Hong Kong people to travel to
China and spend money in <.> Chi </.> in the rest of China <{1> <[1> <,>
</[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X508:1:Z>
And then you afraid that people from mainland China will come to
Hong Kong and stay there <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X509:1:Z>
But uh I  ' ve got some friends uhm or friends of friends in China

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X510:1:Z>
Who who had been travelling all over the places in China

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X511:1:Z>
Anybody want to come to Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X512:1:Z>
But at that prices absolutely impossible

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X513:1:Z>
<{3> <[3> He </[3> just want to visit that is but yeah <{4> <[4>
<unc> two-words </unc> </[4> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#514:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#515:1:A>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#517:1:A>
<[4> Uh </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#518:1:A>


<ICE-HK:S1A-090#519:1:A>
Uhm it  ' s difficult to imagine

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#520:1:A>
Uh maybe uh those American <&> All speakers laugh </&> always uh
bully <.> Chin </.> Chinese

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X521:1:Z>
China try to get back at that

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X522:1:Z>
Well then you had to had to pay the VISA for more </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#523:1:A>
So that uhm I also want to go China except uh especially to
Beijing to have a look

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X524:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#525:1:A>
Yeah you know some many people go there

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#526:1:A>
And they say that uh Beijing is excellent <{> <[> <?> uh </?> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#527:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X528:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X529:1:Z>
Oh that  ' s one point of view but <,> there  ' s so much to see in
over there

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X530:1:Z>
Like culture and museums and the palaces <{> <[> and </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#531:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> palaces

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X532:1:Z>
And it  ' s beautiful and <,> also just

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X533:1:Z>
I feel just like a <unc> one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X534:1:Z>
When I went there in February compared to Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X535:1:Z>
It  ' s so much more laid back and people walks slowly on the
street

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X536:1:Z>
<{1> <[1> And it </[1> has benches and you can sit down

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X537:1:Z>
And <,> and I also shocked by many Beijing people started talking
to me in Chinese and trying to figure out if I can say something or not

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X538:1:Z>
And have a conservation which last for two seconds <{2> <[2> but
</[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X539:1:Z>
For during these two seconds I  ' m happy

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X540:1:Z>
So really they  ' re really nice

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X541:1:Z>
As soon as you are tourist of Chinese

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X542:1:Z>
They really nice to you </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#543:1:A>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#544:1:A>
<[2> Okay </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#545:1:A>
Oh

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X546:1:Z>
So I like that uh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#547:1:A>
If you can't uh find <,> uh <,> friends uh to go to China
with you

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#548:1:A>
What will you do

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X549:1:Z>
Uhm oh yeah I don't <,> know because

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X550:1:Z>
If I also find like a tuition jobs here in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X551:1:Z>
Then maybe it  ' s a good idea for me to earn a little money that
way

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X552:1:Z>
But I think I think uh I know a few people go out into China

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X553:1:Z>
So it  ' s <{1> <[1> kind of </[1> depends on who out to <{2> <[2>
join up </[2> with

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X554:1:Z>
And if they want me or not I always the <unc> one-word

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#580:1:A>
<[4> Okay </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#581:1:A>
Do you like taking pictures

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X582:1:Z>
Actually before this year I hardly ever <,> did

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X583:1:Z>
And now uh now in Hong Kong it  ' s very cheap to develop photos in
<{> <[> Hong Kong </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X584:1:Z>
And it  ' s like so easy cause when I at <unc> one-word
</unc> I have to take the car and I <,> go to the shopping center which
is like ten minutes away by car <,> to get my photos develop

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X585:1:Z>
Then you have to go <unc> one-word </unc> the next week
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#586:1:A>
<[> Yeah so </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#587:1:A>
Oh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X588:1:Z>
But because uh I go to go to the cheaper the cheapest place
around my my home

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X589:1:Z>
And here  ' s like you go to the university or you go to the
seven-eleven or you go like

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X590:1:Z>
Because I also out <unc> one- word </unc> about as well

You go to Stanley Street you have a good deal on <.> Stan </.>
Stanley Street

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X592:1:Z>
And then <,> finished in an hour and they have your photos and it  ' s
very cheap

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X593:1:Z>
And also just the fact because I  ' m here where it  '  so so special

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X594:1:Z>
And I  ' ve brought a new camera which has a zoom

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X595:1:Z>
So I  ' m really proud of new camera which has a zoom

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X596:1:Z>
And I like play with it all the time

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X597:1:Z>
So taking more and more pictures

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X598:1:Z>
It  ' s going bad bad habit </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#599:1:A>
No <{1> <[1> it  ' s good </[1> yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#600:1:A>
But I  ' ve never uhm taking any pictures here <{2> <[2> <unc>
one-word </unc> </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X601:1:Z>
<[1> It  ' s <unc> one-word </unc> </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X602:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X603:1:Z>
I don't usually at home either <unc> one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X604:1:Z>
What does your house look like

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X605:1:Z>
Do you have any pictures of how your house like

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X606:1:Z>
No but here yes I have pictures of the room of the room in the
hall and of the pantry and <,> things like that because </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#607:1:A>
But uhm in the past uhm I have a a friend uh who likes to
take pictures very very very much

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#608:1:A>
Uh she always uh ask me to take picture of her

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#609:1:A>
Yeah so uhm <,> some weekends uh we go to Hong Kong Park the Hong
<{> <[> Kong </[> Park <unc> one-word </unc> to take pictures

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X610:1:Z>
<[> Oh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X611:1:Z>
Of what

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X612:1:Z>
Just the city or people or what </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#613:1:A>
No

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#614:1:A>
Picture of her

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X615:1:Z>
Of her <&> All speakers laugh </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X616:1:Z>
I <unc> one- word </unc> do that

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X617:1:Z>
<unc> one-word </unc> it  ' s funny because uhm <,> a girl
my <unc> one-word </unc> from Beijing live nearly the school at the
same time that I was there

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X618:1:Z>
But she run she run for a seminar or congress with Hong Kong U

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X619:1:Z>
And then she showed me her pictures and then a few days later I
showed her mine

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X620:1:Z>
And on all her pictures she was there on uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X621:1:Z>
Right it was her in front of something else on her with someone
and her in front of the part of this her with a famous person like

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X622:1:Z>
Oh she was uh <,> on the front row of each one of the pictures

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X623:1:Z>
And I showed her mine

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X624:1:Z>
Uh very beautiful like <,> where are you alright

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X625:1:Z>
And I <,> I didn't do it on purpose but it  ' s so happened

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X626:1:Z>
There  ' s a single picture of <,> uh <,> that I taken in Beijing
wow

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X627:1:Z>
And it isn't single picture of Beijing where I  ' m on it

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X628:1:Z>
And no pictures at all like <,> where are you

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X629:1:Z>
And uh maybe you can key in your picture to that like

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X630:1:Z>
I don't bother that I can know where was there

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X631:1:Z>
And I don't specially <,> I find it  ' s extreme like formal
extreme to the other

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X632:1:Z>
A lot of people here and <,> so you pick up the Japanese
<unc> two-words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X633:1:Z>
And you take so many pictures and you words like <unc>
one-word </unc> fund of something else

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X634:1:Z>
<{> <[> But I </[> like take him that something else more than
myself

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X635:1:Z>
It  ' s that <unc> one-word </unc> what I look like

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X636:1:Z>
Right now you now I can feel frustrated

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X637:1:Z>
I didn't have any pictures of me in Beijing

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X638:1:Z>
But it  ' s really funny

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X639:1:Z>
They <,> completely different where we have taken pictures

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X640:1:Z>
So that  ' s that  ' s kind of take I love to take <.> pe </.> people
as well

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X641:1:Z>
People I don't know people expression

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X642:1:Z>
But then <unc> two-words </unc> we need the very very
good theme to do that

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X643:1:Z>
So that  ' s why I <unc> two-words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X644:1:Z>
I can up with people and chat to them <unc> one-word
</unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X645:1:Z>
It  ' s <unc> one-word </unc> about thing <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X646:1:Z>
Yeah it  ' s annoying cause I <,> I like to know so much more about
<,> Hong Kong people

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X647:1:Z>
<unc> one-word </unc> since you walk on the streets you
get the impression that

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X648:1:Z>
There are white people on one side and Chinese people on other

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X649:1:Z>
And that those two <,> never mix

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X650:1:Z>
Is that impression you get as well </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#651:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#652:1:A>
Uhm to me I  ' m afraid not

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#653:1:A>
Because uhm I think that uhm <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#654:1:A>
Actually the situation uh varies uh from different classes

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#655:1:A>
Uhm yeah <,> uhm for those uh middle classes

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#656:1:A>
I think uhm <,> there are increasing more uh <,> connection
between uhm foreigners and Chinese

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#657:1:A>
Uhm for several I knew uhm go to Causeway Bay or Central

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#658:1:A>
It  ' s very easy to find that some Chinese are with some foreigners

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#659:1:A>
And <,> uhm <{> <[> <,> </[> there are quite they are not uh
separated I think

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X660:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X661:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#662:1:A>
But of course uhm <,> for the general public or <,> uhm <,>
maybe of younger generation

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#663:1:A>
When they uhm <,> uhm doesn't have the chance to meet uh
foreigners

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#664:1:A>
Uhm <,> yeah they don't have uhm any foreign friends <{> <[>
except </[> on ICQ uh yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X665:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X666:1:Z>
But it  ' s it like <,> a lot of white people don't ever bother to
learn Cantonese and a lot of

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X667:1:Z>
When you walking the street a lot of local people uhm or their
English just isn't good enough

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X668:1:Z>
So <{1> <[1> it  ' s </[1> very hard to understand each other <{2>
<[2> <,> </[2>

<$> That  ' s one of the reason <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> like normally people should
English but in fact they don't they

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X669:1:>> There  ' s no use they just <,> it  ' s not necessary </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#670:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#671:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#672:1:A>
<[3> Oh </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#673:1:A>
Yeah but in Hong Kong the situation is <,> quite complicated I
think

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#674:1:A>
Uhm you know Cantonese is not uh very important

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#675:1:A>
It  ' s only a dialect so the foreigners won't bother to learn
Cantonese

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#676:1:A>
Maybe just some greetings <{1> <[1> uh </[1> and some very simple
simple conversation

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#677:1:A>
But <,> for Hong Kong people to learn English

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#678:1:A>
Yeah the <,> it  ' s really a problem of the education system but

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#679:1:A>
Maybe because of the mass education so more and more people have
the chance to learn English

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#680:1:A>
But they <,> uhm don't <,> have uhm a <,> real contact with <{2>
<[2> foreigners </[2> in their daily lives

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#681:1:A>
So their English is very limited

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X682:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X683:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X684:1:Z>
But do you think they should learn English when they are in a
country like now Hong Kong belong to China and <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X685:1:Z>
After all should Hong Kong people learn English as <{2> <[2> a
compulsory subject </[2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#686:1:A>
<[1> Did </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#687:1:A>
<[2> Yeah of course </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#688:1:A>
Because <,> Hong Kong is I guess uh it  ' s still an an
international <{1> <[1> city </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#689:1:A>
Yeah and English is an international language <{2> <[2> yeah </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#690:1:A>
If we know only Cantonese or Mandarin <,> it  ' s impossible to for
Hong Kong to maintain its status <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> as it has now

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X691:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X692:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X693:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X694:1:Z>
Yes it  ' s right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#695:1:A>
But to improve the English of general Hong Kong people is <,>
not an easy task <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#696:1:A>
Actually there are many people <,> uhm discussing about this
question <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#697:1:A>
Yeah uh and I think that uhm <,> universities uhm can be good
places for people to lean better English

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#698:1:A>
Because <,> it increases the chance uh for the Hong Kong people to
<,> uhm <,> to contact with foreigners

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#699:1:A>
<{1> <[1> Because </[1> most of the <,> lecturers and some uh
classmates are from foreign countries <{2> <[2> yeah </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#700:1:A>
But I  ' m not sure <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#701:1:A>
And I don't know whether it  ' s my perception or it  ' s <.> re </.>
it it  ' s uh truth that uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#702:1:A>
I found that <unc> one-word </unc> it seems that there are
more and more people going to international school

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#703:1:A>
I don't know <{3> <[3> why </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#704:1:A>
Because in the past I uhm didn't know much people are studying in
international school

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#705:1:A>
But <,> right now I know many friends <,> that they did study in
international schools

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#706:1:A>
So their English is quite <{4> <[4> different from uh yeah </[4>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X707:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X708:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X709:1:Z>
<[3> Yeah </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X710:1:Z>
<[4> Yeah it  ' s pretty good </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X711:1:Z>
So maybe now they focus less on English at normal schools

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X712:1:Z>
So people who want to improve their English really have to go to
international school </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#713:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X714:1:Z>
But it  ' s it  ' s gonna worth for me to <,> to be in a university
and <,> and have all these foreigners come to teach

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X715:1:Z>
If that <,> uh I mean I imagine that happening in France

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X716:1:Z>
I mean <,> if you have a lot of English teacher and they would
feel like <,> like who want <unc> one- word </unc> to to have a
system of our own

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X717:1:Z>
We have to import teacher from abroad and it would be good and
people would learn English which is an international language

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X718:1:Z>
But French people would regard a hurt to have all these
foreigners coming from abroad to teach them as if they can do it on their own

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X719:1:Z>
Which is uh for <?> mes </?> it is strange being in Hong Kong it  ' s
having all these foreigners teacher taking every department and </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#720:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X721:1:Z>
It it like </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#722:1:A>
But especially the uh Arts department

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#723:1:A>
Faculty <{> <[> of Arts </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X724:1:Z>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X725:1:Z>
Faculty of Arts </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#726:1:A>
Yeah because uhm <,> the School of Business uhm most of the
teachers are are

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X727:1:Z>
Hong Kong </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#728:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X729:1:Z>
Well Hong Kong is about business <&>

<$A> laughs </&> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#730:1:A>
And <,> there is an actual <.> pro </.> problem that uh if
<,> the lecturers are all Chinese

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#731:1:A>
Then the medium of instruction <{> <[> <,> </[> will change to
Chinese

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X732:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X733:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#734:1:A>
Just like Professor Lui <{> <[> or <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#735:1:A>
He can't help </[> taking in Chinese

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X736:1:Z>
<[> Just Professor Lui <,> oh God </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X737:1:Z>
Well yeah but then all the all the <,> people in the class
understand so much <,> more

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X738:1:Z>
So much better

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X739:1:Z>
Like he <unc> one-word </unc> he speak Cantonese so has a
joke to tell and suddenly the whole atmosphere relax

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X740:1:Z>
And everybody start laughing and he  ' s <{1> <[1> really </[1>
happy and everybody was very happy

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#X741:1:Z>
And <{2> <[2> but </[2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-090#742:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#743:1:A>
<[2> Not </[2> </{2> really

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#744:1:A>
I hate his jokes

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#745:1:A>
<{1> <[1> You know </[1> they are <.> si </.> <,> <&> tut </&>
just I don't know

<ICE-HK:S1A-090#746:1:A>
