Good evening

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#5:1:B>
Thanks for joining us

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#6:1:B>
No end to the impasse over the financing plans for the Chek Lap Kok
airport

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#7:1:B>
That  ' s despite a whole morning of discussion by the Sino British
joint liaison group  ' s airport committee

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#8:1:B>
Another meeting is expected soon after the Chinese side has
considered proposals put forward today by Britain

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#9:1:B>
Neither side would say what the British proposals are but it  ' s
believed to concern financing arrangements for the future Airport Authority
which will handle the building and running of the airport itself <O> speech
by Tony Calsworthy JLG Team Leader </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#10:1:B>
The British side reportedly wants to resolve all the problems
involving the various airport projects as a package

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#11:1:B>
The Governor Chris Patten has said as much that he didn't want
residual fusses

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#12:1:B>
But a Chinese source said today the British proposal to the
committee did not contain concrete details

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#13:1:B>
The Chinese side is still worried about the government  ' s twenty
billion dollar <?> callable </?> equity

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#14:1:B>
the future airport  ' s revenue especially where it involves
government taxes and airport franchises <&> speech by Chinese team leader Kwo
Fung Ming in Mandarin </&>

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#15:1:B>
Chinese team leader Kwo Fung Ming says both sides will continue
considering each other  ' s views and meet again in the near future

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#16:1:B>
Will the problems be resolved before British Foreign Minister
Douglas Hurd scheduled visit here next weekend <O> speech by Tony Calsworthy
</O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#17:1:B>
The Chinese side has also said they wanted the airport built on
time and has proposed that the site preparation contract be let out first

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#18:1:B>
The Provisional Airport Authority is to announce a final shortlist
of the bidders tomorrow aiming to let it out by September

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#19:1:B>
But whether the successful bidder will trust the government to pay
for the contract without China  ' s approval of financing plans is uncertain

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#20:1:B>
Calsworthy  ' s said today there  ' s still a possibility of delays

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#21:1:B>
Legislator Samuel Wong however believes there  ' s still time

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-002#22:1:C>
Now the new method of reclamation it can certainly uh save
some time

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#23:1:C>
And the maybe we wait for say uh October when we <.> re re </.>
when we meet again in the Legco and vote for funding

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-002#24:1:B>
Legislator Albert Chan zero in on China  ' s hidden motives

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-002#25:1:D>
But up till now the Chinese government still haven't still
hasn't really come up with a concrete proposal regarding the <?> callable
</?> equity or the the uh cost of the airport railway

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#26:1:D>
So uhm <,> it makes up <?> you know I mean </?> it makes one
suspect the the actual the motive of the China  ' s government in uh further
delaying the uh agreement on the airport financing plan

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#27:1:D>
So that <.> i </.> if we further delay the overall cost of the
airport core project will go up definitely

<$B > 
<ICE-HK:S2B-002#28:1:B>
Calsworthy today also insisted that yesterday  ' s disclosure
of Hong Kong  ' s exchange fund was not tied to coincide with the JLG meeting

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#29:1:B>
But he agreed with the Financial Secretary that it would help
prospective lenders for infrastructual projects

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-002#30:1:A>
The government says the unemployment rate is dropping but
union says officials are hiding the real story

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#31:1:A>
The last three months  '  seasonally adjusted figure showed two point
three percent of the workforce is out of a job

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#32:1:A>
That  ' s point three percentage points lower than the figures
released a month ago

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#33:1:A>
However the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions says later this
year eleven thousand foreign workers will flood the territory ready to accept
jobs at rock bottom wages

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#34:1:A>
And that will drive more locals out of work

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-002#35:1:B>
A scheme has been unveiled to pay small depositors in the
defunct Bank of Credit and Commerce Hong Kong all the money they are owed

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#36:1:B>
Details were made public just the day before the first anniversary
of the government  ' s closure of the bank

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#37:1:B>
Depositors however are unhappy saying the scheme doesn't go far
enough

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#38:1:B>
Jeremy Austin reports <O> report by Jeremy Austin with speeches by
Nick Etches BCC Special Manager and Khanam Noor Shah from the BCC Action
Group respectively </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#39:1:B>
The Financial Secretary has welcomed the payment scheme

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#40:1:B>
Hamish Macleod says it  ' s extremely rare in any bank liquidation
for small depositors to be repaid in full and so quickly

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-002#41:1:A>
Legco has voted down a proposal for an independent committee
to review functional constituency elections

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#42:1:A>
Peri Chow reports

<$E> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-002#43:1:E>
The call was made by Frederick Fung who thinks the practice of
returning candidates to Legco by functional constituencies is a violation of
the Bill of Rights <O> speech by translator of Fung  ' s speech </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#44:1:E>
Emily Lau wanted the government to take more drastic measures to
end what she calls an unfair system

<$F> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-002#45:1:F>
It is organized in such a way that one man can have in
addition to his vote in the geographical constituency one or more votes in
one or more functional constituencies

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#46:1:F>
Through the system of having corporate voters or voters who are not
natural persons

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#47:1:F>
This is a total perversion of one man one vote

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#48:1:F>
So unlike Mr K K Fung I <.> subbord </.> I support the abolition of
the functional constituency system

<$E> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-002#49:1:E>
While some legislators elected by functional constituencies
did agree there are room for improvement in existing system others simply
dismissed the suggestions <O> speech by translator of Ngai Shiu- Kit  ' s (
Legco member) speech </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#50:1:E>
In reply Secretary for the Constitutional Affairs Michael Sze said
he didn't accept the accession <?> that the </?> Bill of Rights is being
violated but he agreed that the system could be improved

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#51:1:E>
In the end Frederick Fung  ' s call was defeated by twenty seven to
twenty one votes with seven abstentions

The most contentious part of the debate on Hong Kong  ' s future
electoral system took place in the early hours of this morning

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#54:1:B>
In an unprecedented overnight Legco sitting Liberals successfully
threw out the Conservative proposal for a multi-seat single vote system

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#55:1:B>
Under the proposal voters would have gotten only one vote
regardless of the number of seats in their constituency

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#56:1:B>
Instead Legco adopted a single vote single seat system

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#57:1:B>
May Wong wraps up last night  ' s debate <O> report by May Wong with
speeches from Ronald Arculli ( Legco member), Jimmy McGregor ( Legco member)
</O>

<$G> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-002#58:1:G>
Clearly we will need to study all these with great care
together with any future public comments which we may receive in the next few
months

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#59:1:G>
Our goal surely is to identify the most equitable and practical
arrangements that will best serve the long term interests of Hong Kong <O>
report by May Wong continues </O>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#X60:1:Z>
So I think this system has not yet earned wide spread support
among the Hong Kong people even among those legislators who supported this
one seat one vote system

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#X61:1:Z>
I think many of them <,> uh supported it <,> out of expediency or
convenience for fear that if they don  ' s support it <,> the system of <.>
multi </.> multiple seats one vote introduced by the uh CRC will be carried
through </X> <O> report by May Wong continues </O>

<$H> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-002#62:1:H>
They they they couldn't get any support from the Independence

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#63:1:H>
And for the first time there were some appointed members voting
with us to defeat a proposal

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#64:1:H>
Now that was the only exception this year <O> report by May Wong
continues </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#65:1:B>
After today Legco breaks for its summer recess

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#66:1:B>
With the introduction of directly elected members a lot of changes
occurred during the last session <unc> one-word </unc> of Legco

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#67:1:B>
Tonight Carmen Luk takes us back to review some of the changes

<$I> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-002#68:1:I>
Legco is never the same again after the introduction of Hong
Kong  ' s directly elected legislature last September

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#69:1:I>
Close door meetings became open and gone are the days when a Legco
sitting took just fifteen minutes

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#70:1:I>
Marathon question periods and debates many heated took some Legco
meetings well past midnight

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#71:1:I>
But legislators manage to pass a third <?> fewer </?> of those than
in the past Legco session

<$H> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-002#72:1:H>
<?> Those </?> things have completely changed

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#73:1:H>
We are no longer clearly no longer a rubberstamp

<$J> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-002#74:1:J>
Uh the system is is working uh

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#75:1:J>
Even though uh the efficiency may not be as as fast as what we
expected in the past but this is a normal evolution and I don't think we
should be alarmed

<$I> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-002#76:1:I>
This new Legco made history by forcing the government to amend
its budget

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#77:1:I>
Joseph Cheng a founder member of Lord Wilson  ' s think tank says
Hong Kong civil service must adapt to change and make Legco a partner in
government

<$K> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-002#78:1:K>
Since the nineteen ninety one elections the Hong Kong
government uh can no longer uh be certain that it has a majority support in
Legco and it has to to rely on effective lobbying

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#79:1:K>
There there  ' s no other way

<$I> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-002#80:1:I>
With the arrival of the new governor legislators expect
further changes

<$H> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-002#81:1:H>
He has uh brought in uh a breath of fresh air

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#82:1:H>
Perhaps breath of fresh air is an understatement

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#83:1:H>
Uhm I like to call him Typhoon Chris because he really brings in a
lot of changes to the administration and to the way uh civil servants are
dealing with the public

<ICE-HK:S2B-002#84:1:I>
Hong Kong University senior lecturer Owen Wong says party

legislature should become more efficient and mature
