The severe acute respiratory syndrome &obrack;  Sars &cbrack; may have hurt local
mobile operators ' profitability , but not their creativity . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#4:1>
Operators have sought to turn adversity into a business
opportunity , pitching new-generation data services when information has
taken on extraordinary importance . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#5:1>
In a city where 91 per cent of the population has a mobile-phone
, many users rely on handsets to access Sars-related information , check
corporate e-mail , and when riding the bus home surrounded by wearisome
mask-clad commuters , hopefully provide some entertainment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#6:1>
Sunday Communications , Hong Kong  ' s smallest operator , is
providing a location-based service that identifies Sars-designated buildings
within a 1 km radius of the caller . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#7:1>
&ldquo; In the first two days , we had over 10,000 inquiries ,
&rdquo; Sunday director Henry Wong Kam-heng said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#8:1>
Such has been the public fear , bordering on hysteria , that
demand for information on affected areas has been huge . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#9:1>
Sunday is betting this same thirst for location services will
outlive the need to know whether you are within 1 km of Sars .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#10:1>
To date , demand for location precision has been disappointing , with
a Sunday service pin-pointing petrol stations and car-repair centres ,
attracting few users . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#11:1>
Mobile e-mail use has surged since the crisis and operators such
as SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings hope the habit endures . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#12:1>
Since launching six months ago , SmarTone said it had signed up
companies such as MTR Corp , banks and professional firms . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#13:1>
Employees working from home as a result of the large-scale office
shutdowns means the dependence on remote devices for work communication is
growing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#14:1>
The message has not been lost on the government , which quashed a
rumour that Hong Kong was about to be declared an infected port by asking the
six operators to send millions of messages denying the bogus story .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#15:1>
That kicked off a chain of free SMS offers giving updates on Sars .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#16:1>
New World Mobility marketing director Melanie Lee said 5 per cent of
subscribers agreed to receive free Sars-related messages . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#17:1>
With an increased interest in mobile data , New World launched a
service with Emperor Entertainment Group featuring teen idols . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#18:1>
This may be the future , but for now , operators are getting a
boost from an unexpected source . </p>

<bold> Pentax passes the portability test </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#20:2>
<bold> RAYMOND MA </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#21:2>
<bold> Product: </bold> Pentax Optio S </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#22:2>
<bold . Pros:   </bold> 3.2 megapixel capacity , 3x optical zoom
, compact </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#23:2>
<bold> Cons: </bold> Images can shift to yellow , rather pricey
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#24:2>
<bold> Price: </bold> HK&dollar;3,400 </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#25:2>
The first thing one notices about the Pentax Optio S is its size .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#26:2>
Pentax boasts on its Web site that the camera is small enough to fit
into a can of Altoids . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#27:2>
Having lived in Hong Kong all my life , I have no idea what an
Altoid is , but the point is taken , and the camera is very small for the
number of functions it can perform . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#28:2>
At 8.3x5x2cm , the Optio S is probably on the bulky side compared
with other ultra-compact cameras , notably the Casio Exilim S and M series ,
which are about half as thick . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#29:2>
But bear in mind that the Optio S packs in a 3x optical zoom ,
which probably makes up much of the added bulk . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#30:2>
In terms of picture quality , Pentax digital camera images
generally tend to shift towards yellow and those from the Optio S are no
exception - especially in low light conditions - although to a lesser extent
than with previous models . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#31:2>
For more accurate colour rendering , the Olympus Stylus 300
Digital is probably a better bet , but the camera is twice as thick . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#32:2>
Its 3.2-megapixel capability is also at the cutting edge of what
is available in ultra-compact models at present .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#33:2>
However , watch out for the Stylus 300  ' s sibling , which should
available soon and will have a four-megapixel capability . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#34:2>
Besides having the standard pre-set modes for better night-time
photos , scenery and self portraits , the Optio S also has the ability to
take panoramas and 3D pictures .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#35:2>
It comes with a set of filters , including those for black-and-white
and colour-tinted images .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#36:2>
One filter that can make images appear fatter or thinner should be
popular with kids . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#37:2>
It can record up to 30 seconds of digital video , which is not
bad for an ultra-compact digital still camera . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#38:2>
Ultra-compact cameras are about size and functions , and the
Pentax Optio S walks a fine line between portability and functionality . </p>

<bold> Health crisis demonstrates the true potential of IT </bold>
</h> <O> a Picture </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#40:3>
<bold> POINT OF VIEW </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#41:3>
Sin Chung-kai </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#42:3>
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome &obrack;  Sars &cbrack; has
far-reaching implications for the information technology industry in Hong
Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#43:3>
With normal business activities disrupted by travel restrictions
, schools closed , shops empty and everyone relying on information from the
health authorities to check on the spread of the virus , the Sars outbreak
offers us a chance to recognise the unique nature of IT and the role it has
to play in our society . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#44:3>
The Internet enables our children to keep learning by connecting
them with schools as classes remain suspended . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#45:3>
The government has been using e-public services to allay fears
and keep citizens updated on the disease .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#46:3>
Local enterprises have set up virtual offices to avoid the virus
spreading in physical offices . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#47:3>
E-commerce systems have also enabled buyers and suppliers
overseas to manage transactions in Hong Kong in the face of travel bans .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#48:3>
Alternative ways of doing business , such as video-conferencing and
ordering via e-mail , have enabled companies to keep losses minimal .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#49:3>
Thanks to the Internet , business in Hong Kong has been affected less
severely than it might have been . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#50:3>
n the middle of the Sars crisis , the IT industry has leveraged
technological capabilities to ease the difficulties . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#51:3>
The Hong Kong Computer Society and Microsoft Hong Kong have set
up a Work@Home programme to help companies create and run mobile work
environments . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#52:3>
The Internet Professionals Association will set up an online
portal in an effort to boost the image of Hong Kong in the worldwide
community . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#53:3>
The Internet and Telecom Association of Hong Kong is donating
video-conferencing equipment to hospitals so that patients suffering from
atypical pneumonia and the medical staff caring for them can keep in touch
with relatives . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#54:3>
The outbreak has underscored that IT is a tool that gives people
and companies greater control over uncertainty , both in business and our
everyday lives . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#55:3>
But we know that it can work even better . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#56:3>
The decisive role played by IT will be a valuable asset in
reviving Hong Kong  ' s wounded economy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#57:3>
At a meeting initiated by Secretary for Commerce , Industry and
Technology Henry Tang Ying-yen , to exchange views with members of the IT
industry on how to rescue the economy , we urged the government to explore IT  ' s
potential in helping other sectors . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#58:3>
The government  ' s Digital 21 strategy prioritises promoting the
use of IT and e-commerce .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#59:3>
But despite the efforts of the government , the adoption of IT has
been disappointing , especially among small and medium-sized enterprises &obrack; 
SMEs &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#60:3>
Now is a good time for the government to act more aggressively .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#61:3>
To get companies back on normal business tracks , the government must
help SMEs to understand that IT and e-commerce can result in greater
flexibility , lower costs , higher productivity , greater market penetration
, and closer relationships with suppliers and customers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#62:3>
Public awareness measures in helping businesses move forward will be
necessary . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#63:3>
The government should communicate to SMEs that IT does not run
parallel to " normal &rdquo; business but encompasses all internal and
external business processes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#64:3>
Many IT promotion initiatives of the past focused only on e-mail
communication and Web presence .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#65:3>
They did not take into account that IT can integrate internal and
external business processes in a digital business environment and can have
positive impacts on both individual enterprises and whole industries . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#66:3>
Lessons learnt from this crisis will provide examples of how such
benefits can be achieved . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#67:3>
In long run , the government should identify critical leverage
points for the uptake of IT in different sectors . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#68:3>
Sars has clearly displayed the roles that e-learning , e-public
services , e-retail and so on can play in a knowledge-based economy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#69:3>
To enable every citizen in Hong Kong to enjoy the benefits of IT
, the government should work with trade members to build on innovative
IT-based projects so as to improve the e-readiness of our society . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#70:3>
Such projects create more investment in the IT industry and also
help bridge digital disparities in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#71:3>
This is a win-win proposal that the government should consider . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#72:3>
Sars is the most serious problem faced by Hong Kong since the
1997-98 financial crisis . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#73:3>
It has had a far worse impact than the war in Iraq . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#74:3>
The crisis has already put all business sectors into a difficult
situation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#75:3>
It is imperative that the top priority is to fight and control
the spread of the virus . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#76:3>
But after the peak of Sars , the quick revival of our economy is
also important . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#77:3>
The IT industry has been working hand in hand with the community
to cope with the present challenge . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#78:3>
I urge the government to act decisively and promptly to turn this
challenge into an opportunity . </p>

<bold> Outbreak takes its toll on region  ' s PC market but the effects
are expected to be short-lived </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#81:4>
<bold> Consultants say there is ample evidence the virus has caused a
drop in demand </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#82:4>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#83:4>
The personal computer market in Asia-Pacific is feeling the
impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome &obrack;  Sars &cbrack; , but at least one expert
expects it to be only a short-term problem . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#84:4>
Figures released by consulting firm International Data Corp &obrack; 
IDC &cbrack; show a 10 per cent increase in PC sales to 6.26 million units in the
first quarter of this year compared with the same period last year , but a 9
per cent drop when compared with the fourth quarter of last year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#85:4>
IDC personal systems senior manager Bryan Ma said figures
covering the Sars outbreak were not available , but there was plenty of
evidence that business had slumped .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#86:4>
" We have been speaking to PC vendors who say retail sales have
slowed considerably because people are not going out to shop as much .
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#87:4>
Mr Ma said the 10 per cent growth in PC sales in the first
quarter of the year , compared with the same period last year , was due to
the emerging mainland market , with Australia and India also showing solid
growth . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#88:4>
On mainland sales he said: &ldquo; Traditionally , sales in
quarter one are slower because of the Lunar New Year holiday .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#89:4>
We are seeing the impact on home computer buyers because they are
just not shopping out of fear of the virus , &rdquo; he said . </p> <O> A
table </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#90:4>
However , a spokeswoman for mainland computer maker Legend Group
said the firm was not concerned about a Sars-induced slowdown . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#91:4>
&ldquo; Buying a home PC is generally not an impromptu decision .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#92:4>
While buyers usually give it a lot of thought , they don't have to
spend a lot of time at computer shops because they can get the necessary
information elsewhere - out of magazines and from the Internet , &rdquo; she
said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#93:4>
Mr Ma said PC makers faced an indirect slowdown in the Hong Kong
market . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#94:4>
&ldquo; We have already seen many concerts cancelled and a big
drop in the number of travellers coming to Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#95:4>
This will cut profit , which in turn will cut business need and
ability to buy new information technology hardware . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#96:4>
&ldquo; We have to bear in mind that ultimately , whatever
happens in China will have regional and global implications as it is the
biggest emerging market in the world .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#97:4>
If multinational companies decide to pull out &obrack;  of China &cbrack; and other
countries bar their citizens from visiting &obrack;  China &cbrack; the effect will be huge .

<bold> Pros: </bold> Seriously addictive game play and a nice
change from action-orientated games </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#104:5>
<bold> Cons: </bold> Needs a high-powered computer to render the

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#106:5>
SimCity 4 lets you become the major of your own city and develop
it from a bare patch of land to a sprawling metropolis .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#107:5>
You get to decide where people live , work and play . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#108:5>
If people like your decisions , more will move into your city .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#109:5>
As they do so , you will receive rewards such as status and houses ,
among other interesting things . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#110:5>
In general , parks make your city more beautiful , police make
it safe , schools educate your sims &obrack;  simulated people &cbrack; and all these factors
, and more , contribute to how attractive your city is to live in . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#111:5>
Almost anything you can imagine that makes a city beautiful has
been included in this game , such as parks , schools , universities , zoos
and amusement parks .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#112:5>
Every city has its ugly side and , as mayor , you must decide where
to place waste landfills , for example . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#113:5>
If your city is struggling financially , you will have to make
some tough decisions . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#114:5>
I was going bankrupt and the military offered rent money in
exchange for locating a military base for missile testing nearby .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#115:5>
Unfortunately , the occasional missile test would fail and some sims
would awaken to find new lawn ornaments . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#116:5>
Another tough decision is whether to locate a toxic waste dump
near your city .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#117:5>
Though dumping toxic waste pays well , who wants to live in a city
with pollution ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#118:5>
A crisis can strike your city at any time .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#119:5>
You may not have to deal with atypical pneumonia , but sometimes
sims will go on strike because you cut funding , earthquakes may set off a
fire , riots may erupt if you do not listen to public opinion and , without
careful management , pollution may foul your city . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#120:5>
The game is modelled on how real cities grow and if you play
SimCity with that in mind you should have no trouble being a good mayor .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#121:5>
When you start building your city , everything should be zoned
low density .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#122:5>
Later , as the low-density areas fill up , you should start
bulldozing certain sections of your town and rezoning them for medium density .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#123:5>
As the medium density fills up , rezone for high density .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#124:5>
All this is easier to see if you image how areas in Kowloon have
developed from scattered single homes to massive high-rise complexes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#125:5>
Addiction to this great , great grandfather of Sims games lies
in trying to get bigger and bigger cities .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#126:5>
As your cities get bigger , with some reaching metropolis levels &obrack; 
more than a million people &cbrack; , you receive better rewards and get to see some
cool looking office complexes and high-density housing designs . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#127:5>
The final incarnation of office building is a stage eight
complex that accommodates 5000 employees .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#128:5>
One challenge is to build a big downtown area using several of these
buildings . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#129:5>
You can download landmarks , which have proven highly popular in
previous versions of the game .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#130:5>
Just go to the www.simcity.com Web site to get the latest landmarks .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#131:5>
SimCity has always involved a lot of guesswork and the latest
version is no exception .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#132:5>
One knows that Sims go to work , return home and go shopping , but
cannot know exactly where they go , when or how .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#133:5>
One of the coolest new features this version offers is the ability
to see where a sim goes exactly .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#134:5>
You can import your own sim from one of the Sims games to analyse
what they are doing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#135:5>
Also , this version of the game enables your city to be
integrated with another city developed by you , and commerce links to be
created between the two . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#136:5>
It also has splendid graphics that are so detailed that they
tend to stretch the capability of most computers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#137:5>
I had to turn the graphics options way down .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#138:5>
Some graphics , such as the clouds that lazily float over the city ,
are cute but prevent players from getting a clear view . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#139:5>
In the original , unpatched version of SimCity 4 , it was
difficult to get cities to grow past one million people .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#140:5>
Patches have come out that make it easier to do so , and they also
speed up the game by shortening the time it takes to load and update graphics .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-040#141:5>
SimCity 4 is a fantastic update of the original game .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#142:5>
I highly recommend anyone new to this series to move into SimCity as
soon as possible .

<ICE-HK:W2B-040#143:5>
It is a beautiful place and , best of all , it is designed by you .
