POLITBUORO member Qiao Shi called on the People  ' s Armed Police
&obrack; PAP &cbrack; to step up their vigilance to maintain social stability
next year , the Xinhua News Agency reported . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#4:1>
The top Communist Party cadre in the northwestern Xinhua region ,
which borders three member states of the new Commonwealth of Independent
States , also called for an intensified struggle against separatism and
tighter security along China  ' s borders , the <it> Legal Daily </it> reported .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#5:1>
Mr Qiao , secretary of the Party  ' s Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection , noting a complicated international situation &dash;
an apparent reference to the dissolution of the Soviet Union &dash; called on
the armed police to contribute more to social stability . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#6:1>
The PAP , under the aegis of the People  ' s Liberation Army , is
responsible for quelling social unrest including anti-government riots . Its
numbers were beefed up considerably after the demonstrations of the 1989
pro-democracy movement . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#7:1>
Mr Qiao made the plea at a meeting with representatives to an
enlarged meeting of the Party Committee of the PAP . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#8:1>
He asked the armed police to step up ideological and political
work and further strengthen the construction of the leading organs at various
levels in the armed police in the coming year .

<ICE-HK:W2C-010#9:1>
Also present at the meeting were Yang Baibing , Secretary-General of
the Central Military Commission of the party , Tao Siju , Minister of Public
Security , and other leaders . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#10:1>
Mr Qiao said the armed police had made outstanding achievements
this year in their routine work , participation in the struggle against flood
disasters , and in training and management work . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#11:1>
He said that although the international situation was complicated
, China could help to create a favourable international environment and a
domestic political situation marked by stability and unity to guarantee the
smooth development of China  ' s socialist modernisation construction . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#12:1>
The six-day PAP meeting last week was one of a series of
important meetings held recently in Beijing to strengthen the publicity
security works in view of the stormy international situation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#13:1>
Weeks ago , a nationwide public security meeting was also held
for the first time in 14 years to strengthen the works against &ldquo;
peaceful evolution &rdquo; plans . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#14:1>
Meanwhile , Song Hanliang . The party secretary of Xinjiang ,
which borders Kazakhstan , Kirkizstan and Tadjikistan , called on judicial
bodies to work harder to combat separatism as well as crime , the <it> Legal
Daily </it> said yesterday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#15:1>
In April 1990 , the Moslem-majority region was the scene of major
riots that were violently put down . </p> </I>

<bold> Focus on a &lsquo; vague &rsquo; legal term </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-010#17:2>
<bold> By STANLEY LEUNG </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#18:2>
HONGKONG engineer Lau Shan-ching and many dissidents involved in
the 1989 student movement have felt the full force of China  ' s controversial
&ldquo; counter-revolutionary &rdquo; justice system . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#19:2>
Leading dissent Wei Jingsheng was jailed in 1979 for 15 years
after being found guilty of counter-revolutionary activities . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#20:2>
Mr Lau was arrested on 27 December , 1981 , also for engaging in
&ldquo; counter-revolutionary &rdquo; activities .

<ICE-HK:W2C-010#21:2>
He was set free after serving a 10-year jail term . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#22:2>
After the 4 June crackdown , key dissents including Wang Dan ,
Chen Ziming and Wang Juntao were charged with the same offence and sent to
jail . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#23:2>
The debate on the need to redefine the &ldquo;
count-revolutionary &rdquo; charge is likely to continue for the next two
years or so although some Chinese officials and academics have long felt the
need to replace the vague term with a more explicit legal concept . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#24:2>
In 1988 , the Law Committee of the Standing Committee of the
National People  ' s Congress &obrack; NPC &cbrack; drafted amendments for the
relevant provisions .

<ICE-HK:W2C-010#25:2>
Discussions continued during the NPC annual session in March 1989 ,
only a few weeks before the outbreak of the pro-democracy movement in China .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#26:2>
At the NPC session , Hongkong and Macau deputies were briefed on
the issue . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#27:2>
They were told that Beijing authorities were considering a change
in the legal system which could make Chinese people less vulnerable to
ideological accusations . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#28:2>
Under the proposal , counter-revolutionary offences would be
defined as subversion , making it less likely for people to be prosecuted for
criticizing authorities . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#29:2>
Jiang Ping , vice-chairman of the Law Committee , told the
Hongkong deputies on 30 March , 1989 , that people could be accused of the
narrower crime of &ldquo; endangering the state security &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#30:2>
The new proposal would more clearly defines offences covered by
counter-revolutionary charges , which would comprise any acts aimed at
&ldquo; overthrowing the proletariat dictatorship government , the socialist
system and jeopardizing the People  ' s Republic &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#31:2>
Unfortunately , however , the proposal was shelved following the
outbreak of the student movement in the spring of 1989 , which ended in the
Tiananmen Square crackdown by the People  ' s Liberation Army on 3-4 June .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#32:2>
In the aftermath of the crackdown , a number of students leaders
and intellectuals were either arrested or placed on the wanted list for
&ldquo; counter-revolutionary &rdquo; activities during the pro-democracy
movement . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#33:2>
The question of the &ldquo; amendment &rdquo; was brought up for
discussion once again in an official newspaper in March , 1991 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#34:2>
The <it> Legal Daily </it> said China might abolish the
controversial political crime of &ldquo; counter-revolutionary &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#35:2>
The paper said China  ' s vaguely defined political crime should be
replaced by the internationally recognized charged of sedition . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#36:2>
The offence , if not amended , could cast a shadow over the
future relationship between Hongkong and the mainland under the &ldquo; one
country , two systems &rdquo; policy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#37:2>
During the drafting of the Basic Law between 1985 and 1990 ,
local concern was voiced over the applicability of the offence to the
Hongkong Special Administrative Region . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#38:2>
Eventually , the concept of the &ldquo; counter-revolutionary
&rdquo; offence was enshrined in the Basic Law but differently . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#39:2>
Debate on how the Basic Law article should be translated into the
Hongkong ordinance infer the Common Law jurisdiction is expected to spark
fresh conflict in the territory . </p> </I>

<bold> Policies expected to eliminate the economic imbalance </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#42:3>
CHINA is adopting a &ldquo; comprehensive &rdquo; opening policy
that will not only attract more overseas investment but give a better chance
for various regions to develop . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#43:3>
Under the new policy , areas along the coast &obrack; east
&cbrack; , rivers &obrack; central &cbrack; and border &obrack; southeast ,
northeast and northeast &cbrack; will all be opened to other countries . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#44:3>
Opening of more cities and regions will have a significant impact
on China  ' s macroeconomic development in the coming decade . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#45:3>
Since the introduction of reform policy in 1979 , China favoured
the Special Economic Zones &obrack; SEZs &cbrack; , all in Guangdong and
Fujian provinces , Hainan , and the 14 coastal cities by granting them
preferential treatment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#46:3>
At one stage , former party chief Zhao Ziyang promoted his
strategy of turning the coastal regions into China  ' s economic center ,
leaving the inland provinces poor . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#47:3>
Under his plan of &ldquo; international great cycle &rdquo; ,
production should rely heavily on overseas markets .

<ICE-HK:W2C-010#48:3>
But the plan which further widened the gap between coastal and inland
provinces met with strong resistance and was eventually dropped . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#49:3>
The opening of the border areas in such provinces as Guangxi ,
Yunnan , Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang strikes a balance in the traditional
policy which heavily relied on the opening of coastal regions in the eastern
areas , notably Guangdong and Fujian . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#50:3>
The fast economic growth of coastal regions in the past decade
further widened the gap of development with that of the inland provinces as
shown by differences in income and foreign investment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#51:3>
The opening of border and central river areas could help correct
the imbalance . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#52:3>
With a long land borderline , China  ' s neighbouring countries
include Korea , Mongolia , Afghanistan , Pakistan , India , Nepal , Burma ,
Laos , Vietnam , Russia and three Commonwealth of Independent States
countries . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#53:3>
A number of inland and border regions have recently been opened
to foreign investment .

<ICE-HK:W2C-010#54:3>
They include Pingxiang city and Dongxing country in Guangxi province
, Heihe in Heilongjiang province and Manzhouli city , Tacheng , Bole ,
Yinging in Inner Mongolia . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#55:3>
According to the central decision on opening the Yangtze River ,
the government will grant preferential policies to 28 cities and eight
prefectures to develop a cast area stretching westward from Shanghai at the
river  ' s month to Chongqing in the southwest . </p> </I>

THE Guangdong authorities have arrested 868 pimps and organizers
of brothels and 13,500 prostitutes and their customers in the past three
months . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#59:4>
The figures were revealed by a Guangdong party official in charge
of law and order , Fang Bao , according to the semi-official Hongkong China
News Agency &obrack; HKCNA &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#60:4>
Mr Fang said of the 13,500 arrests , there were 6,200 prostitutes
and 6,480 customers .

<ICE-HK:W2C-010#61:4>
Cases involving 7,000 people had been handled with most of them being
sent for re-education . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#62:4>
Although spread of the problem in the province has been
controlled , he said there was no room for complacency . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#63:4>
The HKNCA report said provincial party authorities and government
had made concerted efforts from April to June to crack down on prostitution
and tidy up public places . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#64:4>
During the period , 5,650 vice dens including hostels ,
hair-dressing parlours , beauty salons , dancing halls and karaoke clubs were
investigated and streamlined .

<ICE-HK:W2C-010#65:4>
About 1,400 were closed with 338 licences suspended . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#66:4>
Hidden rooms in 4,058 hair-dressing parlours were pulled down
with 3,300 massage beds confiscated .

<ICE-HK:W2C-010#67:4>
More than 3,000 massage girls were dismissed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#68:4>
Many companies have improved their management system and signed
contracts with public security authorities to fight crime . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#69:4>
To cope with the anti-prostitution campaign , 63 rehabilitation
and detention centers were built throughout the province to accommodate the
prostitutes and customers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#70:4>
This year , authorities in the province allowed and encouraged
police to raid ant place they suspected of being a brothel inside and outside
their own jurisdictions . </p> </I>

<bold> Xinhua man tipped to assume Guangdong post </bold> </h> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#73:5>
ADEPUTY director of Xinhua News Agency , Zheng Hua , is expected
to take up an advisory post in Guangdong in the next two months , according
to a Chinese source . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#74:5>
Mr Zheng , 62 , will be appointed vice-chairman of Guangdong
People  ' s Political Consultative Conference , the source said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#75:5>
There has been speculation in the past two years on the departure
of Mr Zheng , the No 2 man in the Hongkong branch of Xinhua . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#76:5>
Since his posting to Hongkong from Macau in 1984 , he has been in
charge of the united front and organisational work . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#77:5>
It is understood Mr Zheng , who is an alternate number of the
party  ' s Central Committee and a delegate to the 13th party congress in late
1987 , would retire from Xinhua before the 14th party congress scheduled for
the end of this year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#78:5>
Xinhua  ' s propaganda head , Sun Nansheng , said he had no idea of
Mr Zheng  ' s transfer . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#79:5>
Mr Sun described as &ldquo; subjective speculation without
grounds &rdquo; reports on the possible replacement of director Zhou Nan by
Shenzhen party chief Li Hao . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#80:5>
Mr Zhou was in Beijing on business after attending the National
People  ' s Congress standing committee meeting . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#81:5>
It had been reported that Mr Zhou had been in poor health soon
after taking up the post . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#82:5>
Another deputy director of Xinhua , Zhang Junsheng , said Mr Zhou  ' s
imminent replacement was groundless speculation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#83:5>
He said Mr Zhou was feeling unwell last month and rushed to
Beijing for meetings soon after returning to Hongkong from Shenzhen . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#86:6>
THE United States , as expected , has condemned China for holding
a closed trial of former senior party official Bao Tong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#87:6>
A US State Department spokesman condemned Chinese authorities on
Tuesday for refusing to open the trial to Mr Bao  ' s family and outside
observers and expressed regret that China &ldquo; persists in considering
peaceful expression of political views to be &lsquo; counter-revolutionary
incitement &rsquo; deserving of imprisonment &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#88:6>
The US appears to be the only country which has spoken out over
Mr Bao  ' s trial . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#89:6>
In the last three years , Western countries have put pressure on
Beijing over the jailing of prominent student leaders and intellectuals
including Wang Dan , Wang Juntao , Chen Ziming and Bao Zunxin .

<ICE-HK:W2C-010#90:6>
But Mr Bao Tong  ' s case was seldom mentioned before he was tried .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#91:6>
Commenting on the sentencing of Mr Bao , Robin Munro , a
researcher with a New York-based human rights organisation Asia Watch , said
: &ldquo; The message is clear : there will be no political reform. &rdquo;
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#92:6>
&ldquo; The kind of political reform that people like Bao Tong
stand for &dash; essentially liberalisation and pluralism &dash; is to be
avoided like the plague . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#93:6>
&ldquo; &obrack; Senior leader &cbrack; Deng Xiaoping would have
wanted to give people that message , especially now since he is stepping up
the pace of economic change. &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#94:6>
In the last few months , the US has repeatedly urged Beijing to
allow international observers to attend the trial . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#95:6>
On 7 July , the US State Department said : &ldquo; We are
concerned that Mr Bao receives a fair trial, &rdquo; and that the US would
continue to press Beijing to permit international observers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#96:6>
It is unlikely China would bow to such international pressure on
what it regards is a domestic affair . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-010#97:6>
On 9 July , China ruled out the possibility of letting foreign
observers attend the trial .

<ICE-HK:W2C-010#98:6>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin quoted Chinese judicial
statutes as saying foreigners would be admitted to trials only in cases
involving foreign nationals or foreign affairs . </p> </I>
