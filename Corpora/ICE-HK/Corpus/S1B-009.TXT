<ICE-HK:S1B-009#1:1:A>
How then is it possible to build up our history as a
respectable scholarly discipline

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#2:1:A>
The same can be arts or literary history or cultural history if its
various objects come into being by in irrational and subjective process

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#3:1:A>
It seems it  ' s very very big question

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#4:1:A>
In other words if this is the truth that <,> we feel things that are
beautiful or we study things that that  ' s more or less rational

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#5:1:A>
Uh uh through processes that are subjective right then we we
<unc> one-word </unc> them <,> in our mind or through our central
organs

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#6:1:A>
So these are more or less subjective

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#7:1:A>
If it  ' s not purely subjectively because it depends on what is being
project projected to

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#8:1:A>
For example if I if I uh <,> if I open in your <?> spotlighted </?>
just <,> just direct them as you in in in in the dark <?> wall </?> tutorial
then you would have certain sensations that <?> and </?> not purely
subjective

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#9:1:A>
You may subjective because we call but this is because I project his
life up to you so many what of light alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#10:1:A>
So there are there are objective bases but still the reception of
these <,> images these ways and the way it rest in your memory <,> is can be
moves <?> we call </?> subjective alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#11:1:A>
But the point then is as historian if the object of study is not
simply <,> the projector and the and the uh at this

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#12:1:A>
Of course you can study how how uh this technology you know develop
you can <.> dis </.> you know there is always means and reasons for studying
that but this is not what we  ' re talking about

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#13:1:A>
We  ' re talking about <,> how how culture develops right

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#14:1:A>
We we want to study how you as a <.> au </.> in as part of the
audience <unc> one-word </unc> this experience and what it means to
you

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#15:1:A>
Why you think that these kind of movies are really good or how why
you think that these kind of music that really good or these kinds of story
really enjoyable alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#16:1:A>
So these are the things that you want to study as a <,> as a
historian not as a <unc> one- word </unc> but as a historian as as a
as a as a conscious critic

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#17:1:A>
So it becomes the compress becomes in the end you want to study
study you  ' re you  ' re you  ' re tempting to study something that is <,,> that
is <,,> in people  ' s mind right

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#18:1:A>
It  ' s <unc> one- word </unc> by every individual <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#19:1:A>
Uh here uh William is is helpful because when he says that culture
has to do with community

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#20:1:A>
He says that we are not a cult we are not a community if we do not
share some common things <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#21:1:A>
Value as well as images <,> value more abstract image is more
concrete <,> alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#22:1:A>
So <,> a culture won't be a culture or community won't be a a
community if there is nothing in common that is <?> share </?> by all the by
more or less the people if you are if you you don't have to go to the
<unc> one-word </unc> to find out

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#23:1:A>
You don't have to do that

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#24:1:A>
You just assume the people understand what you mean when you
involve some images when you in when you tell some jokes and when you <,> you
know raise some questions <,> right

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#25:1:A>
Or you when you are <,> find yourself in mid of certain anxieties
you would expected at least some people share the some same feelings

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#26:1:A>
Otherwise this is what we call alienation which means that a
particular individual is isolated completely from the rest of a community

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#27:1:A>
Now if it is not always the case that everyone of us is alienated
then somehow we must be a community uh which means that we must have share
some some common values and common images

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#28:1:A>
And the current culture we  ' re talking about the <unc> one-word
</unc> of cultural products or cultural events is the very important uh
or constitute a very important way of uhm making sure that these images are
there <,> share more or less by people

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#29:1:A>
And of course then is the cultural historian who study the ways in
which these share images and share value change

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#30:1:A>
You see going back to kung fu movie

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#31:1:A>
May be in the past you know people as a image for example of uh uh
I don't know of when you think of <unc> two-words </unc> you think of
<&> Three Cantonese words which is the name of a Hong Kong actor </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#32:1:A>
Let say or if you think of uh you think of <unc> three words
</unc> you know you think you know

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#33:1:A>
But nowadays it will be different you know that the the the popular
icons

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#34:1:A>
Uh this is why popular culture become very very very rear

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#35:1:A>
When you think of popular icon image is different the language <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#36:1:A>
Now the question for study is the issue for study how has this
change come about

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#37:1:A>
It means it  ' s not enough just to say that you know Chinese
literature is different from English literature

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#38:1:A>
Everybody knows the Chinese wow somebody <?> thought </?> were they
they were the same but uhm <,> uhm uh

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#39:1:A>
Identifying differences are always important but it is also <,> it
is perhaps more important to <.> unders </.> to try to understand how these
differences come about

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#40:1:A>
Because if you don't try to understand how differences come about
then it  ' s <,> there are two possible outlets

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#41:1:A>
One is you don't care alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#42:1:A>
So you don't care <,> whether uhm you well uh

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#43:1:A>
If I ask you you want to see a comedy or see a film uh uh or or
tragedy I say you you could say I don't care I don't mind alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#44:1:A>
So you are not sensitive or you are not you don't think the <.> di
</.> the difference will affect you

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#45:1:A>
That  ' s fine but if we would also mean that uhm <,> you would have
certain tragedies that you don't want to change alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#46:1:A>
Uh for instance uh uhm <,> uhm <unc> three- words </unc> I
think I think you understand what I mean that that there are there are three
<,> three conceptions that <,> it  ' s always there and if you if you are so
<,,> indifference to difference <,> alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#47:1:A>
If you are indifference to difference so let let say <,> uhm in in
in in the United State for instance uhm uh U U United State is a country
where there are there are numerous communities and minorities ethic groups
okay <.> obviou </.> of difference or in China

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#48:1:A>
Alright there are so many different ethnic groups and languages <,>
alright so the <unc> one-word </unc> will be all differences

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#49:1:A>
Now if you say that I  ' m indifference to difference <,> alright
which means that uh <,> either you are satisfy with one one version because
you are <,,> familiar with the <,> most of the time and therefore you don't
care about other <,> realities

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#50:1:A>
You don't care about other variations that could be one reason why
you don't care

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#51:1:A>
The reason why other people care may be because uh they are in the
position when they are always being judged apart by another standard alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#52:1:A>
So so when you are in a slightly <,> or more or less the privileged
position then you would be more sensitive to difference

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#53:1:A>
So I say so so difference is something that ought to be very
carefully dealt with I think but because it is something that comparative
literature would have to

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#54:1:A>
The difference between comparative in general I mean <,> it I mean
the good things and bad things about whole concepts because if you say
general is good in the sense that it it <.> de </.> it has an attempt to go
beyond <,> local situation go beyond <?> provisionalism </?> <,> alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#55:1:A>
<?> Provisionalism </?> is something that very <,> very horrible as
if if you live in North Point you only think you care about North Point right
you know

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#56:1:A>
That is senseless but the same applied to a city a country or a
region right

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#57:1:A>
So general has this advantage of asking us to open up our
perspective but it also has <.> dis </.> disadvantage because and this is
where comparative can be of help

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#58:1:A>
Because in comparative you are asked to look at identities or
similarities as well as difference and try to account to the difference
alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#59:1:A>
Not just identify difference you know

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#60:1:A>
A is black B is white <,> but account for it

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#61:1:A>
What makes A A or what makes A black or what makes B white

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#62:1:A>
And when they put together <,> what should be the result or what
should be the outcome right

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#63:1:A>
So it  ' s saying that if you live in what North Point the other one
live in <,> Mong Kok so I mean this is question you comparatively a lot of
people tell me that this point is A and that point is B

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#64:1:A>
The reason why why you should go on to ask is so what you know what
you want to say about once you begin to compare two things right

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#65:1:A>
Because you know otherwise it will be pointless right

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#66:1:A>
So you begin to come out of local uh and and and to try to be
sensitive to <,> different and local situations

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#67:1:A>
Uh this is something that <,> comparative what so mean

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#68:1:A>
Uhm I want to <,> go to uh <,,> this things about <unc>
two-words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#69:1:A>
This this <.> cha </.> this article <,> in uh uh since I mention
Renaissance I think it would be your relevant <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#70:1:A>
<?> Cult </?> comparative literature as cultural history right <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#71:1:A>
The the point being make there is actually very simple but it it uh
it is certain uh demonstration <,> of how literature or literary studies
could be done <,> uh under a new paradise

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#72:1:A>
Uh in this new paradise the focus is not to study the <?> aspect
</?> beauty of <.> literat </.> or literary <?> value </?> or literary work
but to try to analyse and understand how <,> uhm how should I put it

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#73:1:A>
How some set of criteria have been set up and maintain in a
particular period of time and history

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#74:1:A>
And this case he  ' s talking about Renaissance literature and he  ' s
talking about in the period of Renaissance <.> lit </.> literature

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#75:1:A>
How some <,> educated how what the educational practices alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#76:1:A>
What are the dominant <,> schools of thought among the educators
among priests in particular

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#77:1:A>
Uhm <,> intellectuals who have the power to say <,> what is call
culture and what is not

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#78:1:A>
What is the <,> cultivated and what is the uncultivated alright and
attempt to study how these things come about in real terms alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#79:1:A>
We help us to understand that a study is actually constructed by
human society by human community is with with the help of <,,> allow of
concrete social practices

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#80:1:A>
Education is not practice

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#81:1:A>
Uh <,> writing in the newspaper or reading from newspaper is
another practice

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#82:1:A>
Uh listening to your parent is another practice or disagree with
your parent is another practice

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#83:1:A>
Uh peer groups in all all kinds of social practices come about in a
constitute <,> uhm what we believe we share

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#84:1:A>
What we believe the kind of value of images that we share that
somehow represent us as a community <,> alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#85:1:A>
So I would <,> be this attempt is to is to see literature or
literary study or comparative literary study as being responsible as well to
try to understand how literature and all these other apparatus how they are
connected

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#86:1:A>
Compare it in a very very different sense <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#87:1:A>
Not necessarily that is to say compare A literature A with
literature B or particular work in literature A with a particular work in
literature B but to see how literature as a <?> categories </?> is related to
all these various other categories that I could afford <,> right

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#88:1:A>
Literary studies general literature comparative literature in the
case of <?> hong </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#89:1:A>
In other case there is it  ' s the same <?> literature </?> Chinese
and English as well

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#90:1:A>
And you can go back all the way to <,> institutionalization in
university institutionalization in the school system

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#91:1:A>
All the way back to primary education <?> memory </?> education

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#92:1:A>
All of these are related <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#93:1:A>
Uh person just do not come to read Shakespeare when he is born or
she is born

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#94:1:A>
Right <?> year year </?> years of education and culture and
cultivation and training or <?> distraining </?> that allow people this allow
him to be a particular one part

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#95:1:A>
So <,> is it our test also to try to understand the this particular
processes <,> alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#96:1:A>
So I think it I mean otherwise it would be quite uhm frustrating
for a lot of people because they don't understand why they are studying this
and they don't feel they always they don't they don't feel always the sense
of <,> sort of immediate and static judgment as immediate and static
acceptance of <,> of uh uhm some literary artistic work

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#97:1:A>
Because of this huge culture gap uh because of the huge gap also
sometimes between an individual  ' s training or history and social environment
in the social history <,> alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#98:1:A>
Because I may have come from a background which <,> makes me very
difficult to understand uh comedy for instance for example I mean

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#99:1:A>
There may be some reason for that <,> alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#100:1:A>
And then you and and if you want to judge me <?> or </?> by the
way I react to comedy I mean it may be unfair to me alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#101:1:A>
If you want to take into considerations such variations as well I
mean we I think it is my belief that in society <,> as modern as as diverge
diverge as as we  ' ll we have here uh there are a lot of variations <,> that
are not just individual variations but <,> it  ' s a group variations <,>
alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#102:1:A>
Variations within the community and these variance then constitute
the community <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#103:1:A>
Lastly last point <,,> very recently there is a <,> different
attempt to understand history alright uhm history

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#104:1:A>
Because <,> don't don't talk to people in History Department they
won't understand it <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#105:1:A>
Because ordinary history was also understood as <,> symbol record
of the past <,> alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#106:1:A>
First it is records and and second <,> it has to do with the past
or <?> I means </?> they has to do with uh the way past is connected to the
present and may be connected to the future just why we study history right

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#107:1:A>
We want to understand the past in order then we can better
understand the present and the future

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#108:1:A>
This is all very fine but it has this very obsessive <,>
attachment to time that I want to <,> draw your attention to

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#109:1:A>
I mean this process this thinking <,> of this concept of history
base base very much in in temporal development <,> alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#110:1:A>
So I mean it  ' s like how do we come about since the uh fifties and
sixties

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#111:1:A>
How we come about since seventeenth century and sixteenth century

<ICE-HK:S1B-009#112:1:A>
Thinking always about human development in terms of time and this
is as I  ' ve put it out already this is really <?> role the </?> fundamental
talents of Western humanism alright to be <?> historical </?> </I>
