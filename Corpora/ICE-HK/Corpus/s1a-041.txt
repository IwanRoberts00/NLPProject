got one right

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#362:1:A>

was crying at the same time </[> I didn't notice you know which is you know
very quietly you know our tears floating down of our face you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#363:1:A>
We didn't make a lot of sound and noises stuff like that

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#364:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#X365:1:Z>
<[> Oh uh uh uh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#X366:1:Z>
How about you

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#X367:1:Z>
Have you seen that movie as well </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-041#368:1:B>
No I haven't seen that

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-041#369:1:A>
What about Wedding Banquet

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-041#370:1:B>
No

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-041#371:1:A>
No <{> <[> you even </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#X372:1:Z>
<[> Oh </[> </{> you  ' ve missed the best film </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-041#373:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-041#374:1:A>
It was really great isn't it

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#375:1:A>
I mean I heard you know the Wedding Banquet is really really good

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#X376:1:Z>
Oh I saw it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-041#377:1:A>
You uh did you see it

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#X378:1:Z>
Yes I have </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-041#379:1:A>
Aw

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#X380:1:Z>
I saw the film </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-041#381:1:A>
Yeah how come I mean you know they didn't get award

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#382:1:A>
I mean Two Chinese yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#X383:1:Z>
You know I think it probably uhm was more like a political
statement </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-041#384:1:A>
It is <{> <[> uh </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#X385:1:Z>
<[> Because </[> </{> my sister has seen this Spanish film and
she also seen Farewell My Concubine and the Wedding Banquet

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#X386:1:Z>
And she said that Farewell My Concubine is much better than and
it  ' s like Wedding Banquet is excellent as well but it shouldn't have been
that Farewell My Concubine should have won the award

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#X387:1:Z>
Now I think of more a political statement because obviously <{1>
<[1> the </[1> American are presenting Oscar

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#X388:1:Z>
And they present one to China and you know like <{2> <[2> really
</[2> </X>

<$A> <[> There  ' s </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#389:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#390:1:A>
They are into this trade you know whatever <{> <[> you know </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#X391:1:Z>
<[> <.> Di </.> diplomatic </[> <{> <[> </{> <?> strategy </?>
</[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-041#392:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#X393:1:Z>
So obviously I think the more of uhm hidden agenda </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-041#394:1:A>
It is all it  ' s not fair you know like last year

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#395:1:A>
Is that last year that uh Red Lantern and something and then you
know the year before is Ju Dou you know they never never get any chance to
getting this award

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#396:1:A>
Even the other films are really not good or something like that
you know

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#X397:1:Z>
That may be <unc> a few words </unc> that  ' s why </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-041#398:1:A>
I I haven't seen that as well

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#X399:1:Z>
You called me to watch that foreign film and then watch more
Chinese film <{> <[> which <unc> a few words </unc> </[> interesting
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-041#400:1:A>
<[> I know I  ' m you know like uhm </[> </{> uh at that time I
just happened you know not very uhm uh quite occupied at that time I suppose

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#401:1:A>
I was having exams

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#402:1:A>
I don't remember <{1> <[1> <,> otherwise </[1> I I I mean I always
you know I don't like the films in Hong Kong locally made but you know I do
have a <.> st </.> a very strong interest in the Chinese film you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#403:1:A>
Like you know by those you know Zhang Yi Mou whatever you know
<{2> <[2> those </[2> directors  '  names yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#404:1:A>
You know so really good stuff

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#405:1:A>
I remember Yellow Yellow Earth or something have you see this
movie

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#406:1:A>
It was really really good

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#407:1:A>
And the Red Sorghum the Red and then

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#408:1:A>

But have you go any ticket for the Hong Kong International Film
Festival </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-041#413:1:B>
No because we are having exams <unc> one-word </unc>
here

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-041#414:1:A>
Yeah it  ' s so strange you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#415:1:A>
Every time you know the Oscar and the and the film festival you
know <{> <[> always come when </[> you  ' re having a exam yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#416:1:A>
Every time

<[> If I went to <unc> a few word </unc> </[> </{> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-041#418:1:A>
So you just totally you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#419:1:A>
And then you know <.> wh </.> I was talking to my friend Ian right
and he  ' s you know like we we are all you know those lovers of movie great
movies

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#420:1:A>
So every year we subscribe you know from the film <{> <[> festival
</[> and every year we didn't get any tickets for it

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#421:1:A>
I don't know why

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#422:1:A>
So I mean I just this year I was totally giving you know I was
totally give up you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-041#423:1:A>
