Introduction </h> 

 <p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-017#4:1>
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority has been formally established
with the enactment of the Hospital Authority Ordinance on July 25 , 1990 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#5:1>
This statutory corporation will soon take over the management and
control of all public hospitals , which house approximately 90 per cent of
the territory  ' s hospital beds .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#6:1>
Government hospitals have hitherto been managed and financed directly
by a government department &dash; the Hospital Services Department &obrack;
previously called the Medical &ampersand; Health Department &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#7:1>
Subvented hospitals have in theory been owned by voluntary
organizations , but in practice they have been heavily subsidized and tightly
controlled by the government .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#8:1>
While many have expressed concern over the transfer arrangements for
staff, <fnr> l </fnr> and the possible increase in hospital charges under the
Hospital Authority, <fnr> 2 </fnr> little has been written on the longer term
impact of this transfer of ownership and responsibility from a central
government department to a public corporation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#9:1>
This article attempts to evaluate this devolution in terms of its
long-range impact on the health care industry , and in particular , on the
level of health care expenditure , and on the public/private sector mix in
health care financing .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#10:1>
It will also suggest measures to protect the wider public interest
after the devolution . </p>  <h> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#11:1>
Rationale for Devolution </h> 

 <p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-017#12:1>
Doubts have been emerging for some time in many industrialized
countries about the benefits of an expanding public sector in health care
delivery. <fnr> 3 </fnr> The escalation in the costs of health care , slower
economic growth , and government budget deficits have compelled many
governments to put more emphasis on cost-containment. <fnr> 4 </fnr> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#13:1>
In the mid-1980s , a number of politicians in Hong Kong began
advocating the expansion of the private sector as a way of increasing supply
without incurring additional costs to the public sector. <fnr> 5 </fnr> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#14:1>
It was within such a context that the concept of a Hospital Authority
was proposed . </p> 

 <p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-017#15:1>
The reasons given by the government in the establishment of an
independent hospital authority outside the civil service are outlined in the
1985 Scott Report, <fnr> 6 </fnr> the 1989 Provisional Hospital Authority
Report, <fnr> 7 </fnr> and the speech by the Secretary for Health and Welfare
to the Legislative Council in April 1990. <fnr> 8 </fnr> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#16:1>
They can be summarized as follows: &obrack; 1 &cbrack; Greater
flexibility , especially in dealing with personnel matters &dash; such as
salary scales , hiring and firing , the use of part-timers , and allowing
public hospital doctors to be engaged in private practice &semi; &obrack; 2
&cbrack; Better integration of government and subvented hospital services .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#17:1>
This would help to raise the occupancy rate in subvented hospitals
and reduce the overcrowding conditions in some government regional hospitals .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#18:1>
It would also raise the morale of subvented hospital staff by
bringing their remuneration package in line with that of their government
counterparts &semi; &obrack; 3 &cbrack; Greater participation by other major
stakeholders of the health care system &obrack; besides the government
&cbrack; &dash; voluntary organizations , professional bodies , academic
institutions , and community groups &dash; through membership of the Hospital
Authority and its committees &semi; and &obrack; 4 &cbrack; Incentives for
better management through devolution and financial independence at the
Hospital Authority level , and decentralization and financial autonomy at the
hospital level . </p> 

 <p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-017#19:1>
Instead of proposing specific solutions to the numerous problems
encountered in individual hospitals or by individual professional groups ,
the consultants , and subsequently the Provisional Hospital Authority chose
to recommend only a framework or operating system which , in their opinion,
would <quote> &ldquo; of itself be in a position to address the various
problems effectively as they arose. &rdquo; </quote>  <fnr> 9 </fnr> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#20:1>
Members of the public have been asked to believe that things will be
better after the establishment of the Hospital Authority . <fnr> 10 </fnr> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#21:1>
While most would agree that some structural and process changes are
necessary to bring about improvements , the government , however , has either
overlooked or ignored the possibility that a new set of problems would arise
as a direct consequence of the dismantling of the existing organizational and
financing structures . </p>  <h> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#22:1>
The Strength of The Existing System </h> Few would disagree that
participation , integration , decentralization , autonomy and flexibility are
desirable attributes for any organizational system. However , the performance
of a system must ultimately be judged in terms of its output , and not by its
structures and processes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#23:1>
The output indicators of the existing health care system are
remarkable .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#24:1>
Life expectancy at birth in Hong Kong , for instance , is higher than
in many advanced countries &semi;

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#25:1>
the infant mortality rate is also good by industrialized nations'
standards

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#26:1>
&obrack; see Table 1 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#27:1>
The amount of money spent on health care , however , is one of the
lowest among industrialized countries &obrack; see Table 2 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#28:1>
From a cost-effectiveness point of view , the existing health care
system in Hong Kong must be regarded as laudable . </p>  <O> 2-tables </O> 

 <p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-017#29:1>
The system is also not unresponsive to changing demands .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#30:1>
Despite frequent outcries from staff and on facilities shortages ,
the ratio of doctors to every one thousand population and the number of
hospital beds per one thousand population have constantly improved over the
past decades &obrack; see Table 3 &cbrack; . </p> 

 <p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-017#31:1>
A comparative review of the health care systems of other
industrialized countries with free economies <fnr> 11 </fnr> suggests that
the existing structure for the financing and delivery of hospital services in
Hong Kong is , to a large extent, responsible for this relative
cost-effectiveness .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#32:1>
The pertinent factors are: a fixed salary structure for doctors
working in public hospitals &semi; the direct financing and delivery of
services by the central government &semi; and the nature of the political
system . </p>  <h> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#33:1>
<It> Fixed Salary for Public Hospital Doctors </it>  </h> 

 <p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-017#34:1>
Doctors in the public sector in Hong Kong are all salaried
employees , and they deliver 90 per cent of the most expensive hospital
services .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#35:1>
Many doctors in the West are compensated on a fee-for-service
basis, <fnr> l2 </fnr> which is more conducive to over-utilization and hence
more inflationary .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#36:1>
 <fnr> 13 </fnr>  </p>  <h> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#37:1>
<It> Services Financed and Delivered Directly by the Central
Government </it>  </h> 

 <p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-017#38:1>
Hong Kong is probably the only non-socialist industrialized
community that finances the bulk of hospital services from general taxation ,
and delivers them directly through a central government department without
any formal cooptation of citizens and/or interest groups into the management
process. The hospitals come under a tight civil service system of financial
controls. <fnr> 14 </fnr>  </p>  <h> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#39:1>
<It> No Direct Democracy </it>  </h> 

 <p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-017#40:1>
Hong Kong does not yet have a directly elected legislature .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#41:1>
The Hong Kong government is therefore not subjected to the same
degree of spending pressures that confront the governments of many democratic
countries . </p> 

 <p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-017#42:1>
Some have attributed the low health spending and good health
indicators in Hong Kong to factors other than the health care system -
culture &obrack; life style &cbrack; , smaller percentage of elderly
population , and so on .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#43:1>
 <fnr> 15 </fnr> Time-series data taken over the past two decades in
Hong Kong , however , do not support these arguments .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#44:1>
Table 4 shows that the Infant Mortality Rate and the Maternity
Mortality Rate &obrack; both of these health indicators are highly sensitive
to the effectiveness of the health care system &cbrack; in Hong Kong improved
steadily over time given a relatively fixed cultural context , and a growing
elderly population .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#45:1>
The evidence tends to suggest that it is the health care system
rather than the alleged contextual factors that are mostly responsible for
the good health status of the population . </p>  <O> table </O>  <h> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#46:1>
Cost Escalation As A Result of Corporatization </h> 

 <p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-017#47:1>
The transfer of management and control of public hospitals from a
central government department to a quasi-autonomous non-governmental
organization &obrack; QUANGO &cbrack; could result in serious cost-escalation
because of a number of reasons to be explored in the following paragraphs .
 </p>  <h> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#48:1>
<It> The Dismantling of the Tight Civil Service System of Financial
Controls </it>  </h> 

 <p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-017#49:1>
The set of elaborate civil service controls over capital ,
personnel and other recurrent expenditures will be made non-obligatory under
the Hospital Authority .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#50:1>
The Hospital Authority can create positions with much better packages
of remuneration than that offered in the civil service .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#51:1>
The government , with its capital expenditure control procedures ,
has , up to now, been rather successful in containing the proliferation
within the public sector of hi-tech medical technology , 16 which has been
demonstrated to be a major factor responsible for health care cost-escalation .
 <fnr> 17 </fnr> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#52:1>
Diffusion of expensive medical equipment is more likely to happen
with the Hospital Authority under which purchasing decisions will no longer
be subjected to government regulatory controls .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#53:1>
Alternative control systems , such as legislation on restricting the
supply of equipment and facilities , <fnr> 18 </fnr> binding fee schedules ,
 <fnr> 19 </fnr> peer review/case &dash; mix management using diagnosis
related groups &obrack; DRGs &cbrack; , <fnr> 20 </fnr> are either grossly
inadequate or totally non-existent .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#54:1>
The development of these systems requires expertise and time , and
will be very unpopular with the medical community .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#55:1>
Moreover , the efficacy of such systems in containing health care
costs is still inconclusive . <fnr> 21 </fnr> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#56:1>
The establishment of the Hospital Authority in 1990 would , in
reality , mean the dismantling of the existing civil service financial and
procedural control systems without any effective alternative systems in place .
 </p>  <h> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#57:1>
<It> Institutionalized Participation of Citizens and Special Interest
Groups </it>  </h> 

 <p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-017#58:1>
The Hospital Authority , comprising representatives of
professional groups, community leaders , and high-powered businessmen , will
be much more likely , and will be in a much more powerful position , to
bargain for more resources from the Finance Branch than the present Director
of Hospital Services .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#59:1>
Some Hospital Authority members might be members of the Executive
Council .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#60:1>
which ultimately makes all policy decisions on public expenditure .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#61:1>
Others might also have access to the governor through different
channels .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#62:1>
The current Director of Hospital Services has to rely on the
Secretary for Health and Welfare and the Chief Secretary to speak on his
behalf .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#63:1>
As a civil servant , he is also more junior in rank than the
Financial Secretary , who makes all the initial budgetary allocations . </p> 
 <h> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#64:1>
<It> Financial Independence </it>  </h> 

 <p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-017#65:1>
Just like any other government department , all revenue currently
received by the Hospital Services Department from fees and other sources goes
directly to the government Treasury .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#66:1>
There is little incentive for the department to increase charges or
to find new ways to raise revenue .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#67:1>
The department must keep spending within budgetary limits .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#68:1>
Medical and health expenditure as a percentage of overall public
expenditure has remained fairly constant over the past decades . <fnr> 22
 </fnr> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#69:1>
As a public corporation , the Hospital Authority enjoys financial
independence , and is allowed to retain whatever income it receives. In the
event of inadequate funding from the government , the Hospital Authority can
raise charges , admit more private patients or raise money through other
means .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#70:1>
The need to contain spending is less pressing under the Hospital
Authority . </p>  <h> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#71:1>
<It> Corporatization without Competition </it>  </h> 

 <p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-017#72:1>
There is clear evidence to show that privatization or
corporatization can result in greater efficiency and lower cost if and only
if the privatized or corporatized entity is faced with competitive pressures .
 <fnr> 23 </fnr> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#73:1>
There are no indications that elements of competition will be
injected into the new system .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#74:1>
The inclusion of subvented hospitals into an integrated structure
suggests that the reverse might be true . </p>  <h> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#75:1>
<It> Power Play by Special Interest Groups </it>  </h> 

 <p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-017#76:1>
The devolution creates a golden opportunity for different special
interest groups to assert themselves .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#77:1>
Unions will reject all bridge-over arrangements unless the terms of
service offered by Hospital Authority are substantially better than what is
currently being offered by the government .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#78:1>
 <fnr> 24 </fnr> They will also seize the opportunity to press for
better working conditions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#79:1>
Staff from subvented hospitals have fought and won HK&dollar;600 million
worth of additional fringe benefits annually .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#80:1>
 <fnr> 25 </fnr> Senior officials who are likely to be leading
positions in the new structure will continue to lobby for the creation of
more powerful posts with attractive remunerations . </p>  <h> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#81:1>
<It> Environmental Factors </it>  </h> 

 <p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-017#82:1>
The devolution takes place at a time when a number of external
factors have created a situation which makes cost-containment difficult .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#83:1>
The first factor is the high rate of economic growth of Hong Kong
over the past decades . <fnr> 26 </fnr> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#84:1>
Many studies have shown that the income elasticity of demand for
health services is greater than 1.27 This means that the demand for more and
better health care services is on the increase in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#85:1>
The second consideration is the move towards a more representative
government .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#86:1>
Direct elections to the Legislative Council will be in traduced in
the later part of 1991, creating , for the first time in Hong Kong ,
politicians who will have to submit themselves for re-election by the general
public .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#87:1>
The pressure on the government to spend more on social services will
be greater than before .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#88:1>
The third factor is the growth in the elderly population .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#89:1>
The recent draft White paper on Social Welfare estimated that the
elderly population would rise from 721,600 in 1989 to 959,600 in 1999.23
Studies have shown that per capita health expenditures for the elderly are
between 1.7 to 5.5 times the spending for the non-elderly , with a
sixteen-country average of 4.0. <fnr> 29 </fnr> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#90:1>
Lastly , there is the ever-increasing complexity , sophistication and
costs of medical technology and procedures .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#91:1>
Computerized tomographical scanners &obrack; CTs &cbrack; , magnetic
resonance imaging &obrack; MRIs &cbrack; , extracorporeal shock wave
lithotripsy &obrack; ESWL &cbrack; , coronary by-pass surgery , organ
transplants and so on are being adopted and diffused at a very rapid rate
throughout the industrialized world. <fnr> 30 </fnr> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#92:1>
The impact of hi-tech medicine on health care expenditures is bound
to be felt in Hong Kong as well . </p> 

 <p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-017#93:1>
The above mentioned factors suggest a clear prognosis for the
Hospital Authority: Health Expenditures Will Go Up .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#94:1>
The Secretary for Health and Welfare has estimated that the
additional expenditure for the setting up of the Hospital Authority will be

&dollar;1,000 million per annum. <fnr> 31 </fnr> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#95:1>
This only includes expenses for &obrack; 1 &cbrack; the establishment
of the headquarters &semi; &obrack; 2 &cbrack; the implementation of
management reforms &semi; and &obrack; 3 &cbrack; the inclusion of staff in
subvented hospitals into the Hospital Authority  ' s remuneration package .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#96:1>
This does not include additional expenditures arising from future
changes in the salary structure of the Authority , nor does it include
expenses relating to improvement of services to patients . </p>  <h> 

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#97:1>
Implications of the Increase in Health Expenditure </h> 

 <p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-017#98:1>
The increase in the overall health expenditure has a number of
implications. Either taxes have to go up to finance the increase or resources
have to be diverted from other services such as education , housing and
welfare .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#99:1>
Alternatively , the Hospital Authority may have to expand its
cost-recovery measures &dash; raising fees <fnr> 32 </fnr> or treating more
fee-paying private patients .

<ICE-HK:W2A-017#100:1>
 <fnr> 33 </fnr> A third possibility is for the government to find or
expand on alternative financing mechanisms such as private health insurance
or insurance schemes managed by a public body . <fnr> 34 </fnr>  </p>  </I>
