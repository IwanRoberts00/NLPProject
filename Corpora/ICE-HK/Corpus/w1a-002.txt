<ICE-HK:W1A-002#1:1>
<p> Liberty or freedom has been highly valued in human history while its
meaning has heated up much debates .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#2:1>
Various delineations can be found whereas Isaiah Berlin has identified
two prevailing families of conceptions of liberty accepted by many as the two
most central ones .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#3:1>
They are the &ldquo; negative sense &rdquo; which sees freedom as
individual independence from others and the positive sense &ldquo; that
identifies freedom with a sense of self-realisation .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#4:1>
However , this essay will focus only on the former one which has
canvassed extensively in liberal and modern society , drawing upon Charles
Taylor  ' s critique to it in the positive stand . </p>

 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#5:1>
<p> Taylor rejects the idea of freedom as mere absence of external obstacles .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#6:1>
Men are purposive beings who strive for realising oneself , in a way
consciously or unconsciously , discriminating among motivations and desires
so as to identify what is really good to oneself .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#7:1>
It is improbable that such a process outrules all internal accounts .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#8:1>
More decisively , in experimentating what is right or wrong to do ,
man can be fallible .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#9:1>
Taylor thus objects also to reserve the final authority with regard to
assessing an authentic life to the subject only .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#10:1>
Such a line of thinking , Taylor asserts , is indefensible . </p>

 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#11:1>
<p> Before further substantiating <-> - Taylor  ' s </-> <+> Taylor  ' s </+>
critique , a brief recapitulation of the central themes of negative liberty
deems necessary .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#12:1>
Hitherto in the realm of negative liberty , one can hardly find a
perspective in unanimity , meaning that upon certain ideas in <-> concensus
</-> <+> consensus </+> , views are diversified arising from different
theorists .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#13:1>
On one side of the continuum , there is a crude Hobbesian concept
where <quote> &ldquo; being free is a matter of what we can do , of what it
is open to us to do , whether or not we do anything to exercise these options .
&rdquo; </quote> <fnr> &obrack;1&cbrack; </fnr> </p>

 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#14:1>
<p> Taylor named it as <quote> &ldquo; crude &rdquo; </quote> in the sense
that it manifests - somehow &lsquo; the most extreme and original concept of
negative liberty .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#15:1>
That an <-> absense </-> <+> absence </+> of external physical or
legal obstacles is a sufficient condition of freedom .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#16:1>
Such a pure opportunity concept demands only a provision without any
man-made <-> inteference </-> <+> interference </+> .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#17:1>
It has nothing to do with our inabilities or internal attributes ,
say when we wish to fly but cannot , when we wish to travel round the world
but have no money , when we highly value a diligent life but lack motivation .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#18:1>
In such circumstances , we cannot be said to be &ldquo; unfree
&rdquo; . </p>

 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#19:1>
<p> On the other side , there are theorists such as J. S. Mill who
incorporate some notion of self-realisation , self-fulfillment to freedom ,
that something can fail on account of inner reasons besides external barriers
or on both .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#20:1>
For instance , my fear of getting hurt have stopped me from learning
to ride bicycle even though I long to do so , Or I know that sleeping too
much is not good for me but just could not resist that comfort <-> ofidling
</-> <+> of idling </+> .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#21:1>
Obviously , some internal barriers need to be overcome and some
degree of exercise is crucial for a men to be thought free .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#22:1>
Above all , such a modern notion still identifies freedom as a matter
of being able to do something or other , of not having internal or external
obstacles in one  ' s way , rather than to ascribe man  ' s capacity to realise
as an important asset to freedom . </p>

 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#23:1>
<p> There are reasons of course , for the family of negative liberty to
define freedom so tough-mindedly .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#24:1>
First , it enjoys an elegant simplicity as it requires only knowledge
of personal desires .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#25:1>
Second , the dominance of positivist thinking and natural science
orientation has been discriminating against things that appear too
metaphysical .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#26:1>
To talk of self-realisation or actualising freedom is something out
of the realm of human rationality .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#27:1>
It seems unwise to let oneself indulge into such thinking . </p>

 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#28:1>
<p> Third and the most significant point is the fear of Totalitarian Menace ,
the fear of being coerced or manipulated in the name of freedom .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#29:1>
The negative theorists are therefore driven into alliance under the
shield of crude view .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#30:1>
It is endangering to have one  ' s mentality to be assessed or
second-guessed by someone else , to have people coming around telling you
that you have identified wrongly with your authentic self , that you should
have inclined to something else .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#31:1>
Historical episodes such as Cultural Revolution , ideas promoting
collective consciousness have threatened no matter the crude defense or the
modern notion to hold firmly as ever to individual independence that <quote>
&ldquo; each person  ' s form of self realisation is original to him or her and
can therefore only be worked out independently . &rdquo; </quote> <fnr>
&obrack;2&cbrack; </fnr> </p>

 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#32:1>
<p> Nonetheless , such a Maginot Line mentality has put off many other
valuable intuitions of human agency .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#33:1>
In the first place , its oversimplified version of freedom has thrown
men into an arena of wants and desires only .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#34:1>
Yet , human beings have more to do with desires for food , for
comfort , for security and so on .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#35:1>
Rather , man can desire over desires , that he has the ability to
differentiate and evaluate upon his desires .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#36:1>
In a way , mere identification of wants and desires <-> gurantees
</-> <+> guarantees </+> no freedom , not to mention the probable case of
false appreciation .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#37:1>
To Taylor , freedom can be augmented through strong evaluation and
discrimination among motivations , mind that he does not assert that
fulfilling the latters will <-> autonomatically </-> <+> automatically </+>
make one free . </p>

 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#38:1>
<p> The case is upon strong evaluation concerning with the qualitative worth
of different desires , we find that capacities relevant to freedom involve
entities such as self understanding , self control and moral discrimination .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#39:1>
In other words , since we can fail to discriminate , since we may
lose self control like the people addicted to drug or over-eating , it is
more likely that we are unfree rather than free if we remain in the shallow
conception of man .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#40:1>
It follows that <quote> &ldquo; one is free only to the extent that
one has effectively determined oneself and the shape of one  ' s life . &rdquo;
</quote> <fnr> &obrack;3&cbrack; </fnr> The concept of freedom here is an
exercise concept . </p>

 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#41:1>
<p> In the second place , the overt allegiance against the mentioning on ends
or discriminations among motivations faces strong rebuttals .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#42:1>
For a point , refusal to mention does not imply its <-> non-exitence
</-> <+> non-existence </+> .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#43:1>
For another point , it is unconvincing that the negative view is
really free from all kinds of discrimination in a moral sense .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#44:1>
Taylor has given an example as to putting up a new traffic light at
an intersection close to one  ' s home against a law forbidding one from
worshipping .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#45:1>
For the former , it is unlikely that one will interpret it as a
jeopardy to freedom .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#46:1>
Perhaps , it induces some inconvenience , but it is far from
intruding into one  ' s personal life .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#47:1>
For the latter , however , one will probably regard it as a threat to
personal liberty . </p>

 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#48:1>
<p> Why is this so ? In essence , a background of significance has been
naturally expelled out that certain goals and activities are more significant
than others .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#49:1>
In fact , when the advocates for negative liberty agree that liberty
of some must depend on the restraint on others and assume that the area of
men  ' s free action must be limited by law , they <-> unaminously </-> <+>
unanimously </+> support that some portion of human existence must remain
independent of the sphere of social control when asked when the boundary
should lie .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#50:1>
For instance , Benjamin Constance had declared that <quote> &ldquo;
at the very least the liberty of religion , opinion , expression , property ,
must be <-> guranteed </-> <+> guaranteed </+> against arbitrary invasion .
&rdquo; </quote> <fnr> &obrack;4&cbrack; </fnr> </p>

 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#51:1>
<p> Theorists of negative liberty just cannot escape from entrenching in
discriminations between obstacles as <-> representating </-> <+> representing
</+> more or less infringement of freedom .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#52:1>
The agenda just cannot hide itself .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#53:1>
Moreover , such a discrimination is necessary qualitative in the
sense that comparison in terms of number of acts restricted is refutable .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#54:1>
Taking again the restriction towards the way one crosses the road and
worships as example , the detrimental effects of a single law prohibiting
religious activity are far overwhelming then say , hundreds of traffic lights
erected . </p>

 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#55:1>
<p> It follows that we are ongoingly performing qualitative discriminations
among motivations as each of us bears a significance of purposes .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#56:1>
In essence , it is what makes us distinguishable from other species
beings that we have the capacity to reflect and to evaluate .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#57:1>
Furthermore , it is only when we employ strong evaluation , that we
could realise , <quote> &ldquo; the purposes we know to be more significant
are not always those which we desire with the greatest urgency to encompass ,
nor the ones that actually always win out in cases of conflict of desire .
&rdquo; </quote> <fnr> &obrack;5&cbrack; </fnr> </p>

 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#58:1>
<p> In other words , significance does not imply wanting more .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#59:1>
For instance , I feel that searching a mission in my life is
significant to me , yet I may be much more strongly attached to my desires as
to sleep more , to enjoy more and so on .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#60:1>
The strive for material or physiological desires may refrain me from
doing things which I think is good .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#61:1>
Thus , the fact that I am doing what I want , in the sense of
following the strongest desire is not sufficient to establish that I am free .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#62:1>
On the contrary , identification with the strongest desire may <->
possibily </-> <+> possibly </+> lead to unfreedom rather than freedom . </p>

 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#63:1>
<p> Having said so much on the need for strong evaluation , for qualitative
reflection and asserted certain necessary internal , motivational conditions
for freedom , a question emerges as who or how to decide &ldquo; What is
authentic ? &rdquo; to oneself .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#64:1>
When it cannot be guided by desires alone , what is the alternative ?
How can it be articulated ? </p>

 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#65:1>
<p> For <-> theoeists </-> <+> theorists </+> of negative liberty , they may
so far concede that freedom cannot merely be the absence of external
obstacles , but the absence of external obstacles to significant action , and
that freedom may or may not rely on an opportunity concept upon which
opportunities are unequal .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#66:1>
However , they insist firmly that only the subject himself has the
right to perform the final arbitration .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#67:1>
No valid guidance can be provided in principle by outside authority
because of human diversity and originality .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#68:1>
In brief , no one is allowed for second-guessing . </p>

 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#69:1>
<p> Nevertheless , such an individualistic view sounds only if one  ' s
perception of desires is absolutely right .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#70:1>
Can the case be so ? It is so if only our feelings are brute , such
as the imperceptible raw feel like the pain in bleeding and the thirst for
water .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#71:1>
But many of our feelings and <-> disires </-> <+> desires </+> are
not brute .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#72:1>
They are import attributing in a sense that they are to the least
innoculated with our experiences and judgement .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#73:1>
Thus , we can be in error in feeling , say , anger .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#74:1>
For instance , a friend persuading me out for dinner when I am nearly
burnt out in work may infuriate me as not considerate enough , but on
arriving to a birthday party awaiting for me may make me laugh only at my own
narrow-mind . </p>

 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#75:1>
<p> In many more cases , we have experienced mistakenly , we have perceived
wrongly .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#76:1>
Somehow , our feelings involve how we experience the situation and
how we interpret our experience .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#77:1>
In such a way , can anyone guarantee that he or she can never be in
error , unless there is nothing to be right or wrong ? Probably no one can .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#78:1>
But if there is no right or wrong , how can one explain when people
do repudiate some desires and safeguard others ? How can one explain that
there are desires when we abandon we lose nothing ? Thus the subject himself
cannot be the only final authority on the question whether he is free ,
whether his desires are authentic . </p>

 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#79:1>
<p> And wrong perceptions can be internal barriers to keep us away from
freedom .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#80:1>
We may fail to detect them and thus fail in self-realisation .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#81:1>
Thus , second-guessing by others is justifiable as a way to assist
rather than to hinder our search for freedom .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#82:1>
Second-guessing is not a kind of coercion as perceived by negative
liberty .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#83:1>
It is done through dialogue and strong evaluation .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#84:1>
There are opinions by others <-> worthnoting </-> <+> worth noting
</+> .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#85:1>
There are advices by others worth listening .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#86:1>
There are sharing of experiences by others worth attending to .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#87:1>
Communication and understanding among people is an aid to growth and
clairvoyance . </p>

 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#88:1>
<p> Furthermore , once we admit that our feelings are import-attributing ,
then we admit that there is no objective understanding exists .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#89:1>
There is no absolute truth or correct interpretation indeed .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#90:1>
An articulation can be wrong .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#91:1>
Reality can be distorted .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#92:1>
We should well aware of our limitation in experience and our
perception as frequently impartial and uncertain .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#93:1>
It is only when we open ourselves to risking and testing our
perceptions and judgements through dialogical encounter and deep reflective
evaluation , that we may get closer to the truth . </p>

 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#94:1>
<p> In a way , interpretation upon interpretation is necessary in a sense
that our deep evaluations are never complete .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#95:1>
There is <-> alway </-> <+> always </+> room for challenge ,
re-evaluation and re-consideration .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#96:1>
Human world is such an indeterminate zone but we are not to retrieve
from searching the truth .
 
 
 
<ICE-HK:W1A-002#97:1>
Moment by moment , we should still stand in the best of one  ' s
ability to provide good reasons for judgement with an open mind . </p>
