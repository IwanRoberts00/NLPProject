<bold> The Star Forest </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#2:1>
Once upon a time , there was a small forest in a far country .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#3:1>
The forest was bright and warm , and many plants and animals lived
there .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#4:1>
In the centre of the forest was a huge tree .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#5:1>
The trunk was so big that it would take at least ten people to embrace
it . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#6:1>
In the hot summer , animals from different parts of the forest
would to stay under the tree .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#7:1>
The shaded area was the coolest place in the forest .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#8:1>
Though the leaves were dense , some sunlight still slipped through the
gaps between leaves and fell onto the forest floor .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#9:1>
The specks of light looked like stars on the indigo ground of the
forest .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#10:1>
When the leaves wavered in the breeze , the stars on the ground
flickered and shone .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#11:1>
In this way , people could see stars both in the daytime and at night .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#12:1>
And this is why the forest was called the Star Forest . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#13:1>
There were many birds and squirrels living on the boughs and
branches of the big tree .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#14:1>
Gigi was a small sparrow who lived there with her parents and three
brothers .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#15:1>
She couldn't fly yet as her feathers were not completely grown , so
she always stayed in the nest .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#16:1>
The only thing she could do while waiting to be fed was to stretch
her neck and see what was around her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#17:1>
The surrounding environment was so attractive especially the stars
that shone below during the daytime at above at night .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#18:1>
She never felt bored . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#19:1>
One morning , she was looking around as usual when she noticed
something moving slowly through the forest .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#20:1>
She watched this interesting thing attentively .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#21:1>
Finally , it appeared under the big tree &dash; a large bird with
vividly coloured feathers .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#22:1>
It had a long elegant tail of deep blue feathers with green and
yellow eye-shaped patterns .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#23:1>
Many animals gathered beneath the tree to see this extraordinary bird
, Bibsy and Moxy , the rabbit twins , scrunched up their noses in excitement .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#24:1>
The white wolf , Michelle , who was generally recognised as a beauty
, stared jealously at the charming bird .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#25:1>
Furby the squirrel stopped eating nuts and gazed down at the lovely
blue bird .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#26:1>
Even Antonio the owl was awakened by the commotion . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#27:1>
But the bird was accustomed to receiving attention from others .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#28:1>
He walked forward without seeming to notice the other animals .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#29:1>
He rose his head slightly and fanned out the long feathers of his
tall .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#30:1>
The animals chattered even more excitedly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#31:1>
Gigi stared at the lovely bird .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#32:1>
She opened her mouth but couldn't say anything .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#33:1>
The beautiful bird then strolled slowly to another part of the forest
and gradually disappeared from view .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#34:1>
Gigi heard somebody say that it was a peacock . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#35:1>
From that day on , Gigi  ' s goal was to have the charming feathers
and the elegant look of that peacock .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#36:1>
She imagined that she herself would become a peacock when she grew up .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#37:1>
Before long , she became able to fly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#38:1>
Day after day passed , but she still didn't look like a peacock .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#39:1>
Her feathers were still short and yellow and brown .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#40:1>
Besides , she found that she couldn't even walk elegantly like the
peacock did .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#41:1>
She had to move forward in little leaps .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#42:1>
She became depressed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#43:1>
At last , she became jealous of the peacock .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#44:1>
Every time she heard someone appreciating it , she felt annoyed .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#45:1>
One clear , cloudless night , Gigi couldn't sleep .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#46:1>
She lay in her nest and thought of ways to make herself as attractive
as the peacock .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#47:1>
At that moment , she heard a wonderful song from far away .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#48:1>
The voice was so tender &dash; just like a mother telling a story to
her children .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#49:1>
Gigi was curious so she left the nest quietly and followed the sound
to its source &dash; a yellow bird singing in the branch of a small tree .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#50:1>
Gigi thought , &lsquo; it must be a nightingale. &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#51:1>
She had heard a story about nightingales when she was small .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#52:1>
She knew that nightingales always sang at night , but she hadn't
heard one before .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#53:1>
She couldn't believe that such a wonderful song could come from such
a plain looking bird .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#54:1>
Gigi hid herself in a branch of another tree and stared at the
amazing bird .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#55:1>
Its voice was so soft but it carried a little sorrow .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#56:1>
Gigi closed her eyes and fell into the world of the song till the
music ceased .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#57:1>
When she opened her eyes again , the nightingale was gone . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#58:1>
From that day on , the gentle voice of nightingale was always on
her mind .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#59:1>
She wanted to sing as beautifully as a nightingale .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#60:1>
And she knew that she should do something to make herself more
charming rather than just wait for colourful peacock to feathers grew out
from her body . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#61:1>
Eventually , she got an idea .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#62:1>
She followed the peacock and paid close attention to his behaviour .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#63:1>
She secretly visited his home and tried to collect some of his old
feathers .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#64:1>
However , even after several days , she was only able to collect
three of them .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#65:1>
She realised that it would take a rather long time to collect enough
feathers to cover her whole body and make a long tail , so she changed her
plan . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#66:1>
Everyday , she followed different kinds of animals and birds and
collected whatever fur and feathers dropped off .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#67:1>
She thought that with this method she would be even more colourful
than the peacock and she could get enough material to cover her body much
more quickly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#68:1>
At night , she flew outside the forest and practised imitating the
peacock  ' s movements and the nightingale  ' s song . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#69:1>
Gigi  ' s parents noticed that she always left the nest in the
early morning and returned very late at night .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#70:1>
They became worried about her since she still hadn't learnt to hunt
or make nests and she was almost an adult . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#71:1>
After a month , she had enough fur and feathers to cover her
whole body .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#72:1>
And she thought she could successfully imitate both the peacock and
the nightingale .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#73:1>
Gigi was very happy .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#74:1>
She imagined that the other animals and birds would cheer and whistle
appreciatively at her the next morning .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#75:1>
She then put the feathers and pieces of fur carefully on her body one
by one using a honey glue .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#76:1>
She put different hues and different parts of her body .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#77:1>
She had a few long feathers from hens for her tail and some small
white ones for her head .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#78:1>
After many hours of dressing up , she looked down at her costumed
body and smiled with satisfaction . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#79:1>
The next morning was sunny .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#80:1>
The other animals had already woken up and were starting the day when
Gig appeared with her new look .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#81:1>
She walked slowly and awkwardly on her trembling legs .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#82:1>
She rose her little head slightly as the peacock had done and walked
in front of the other animals and birds .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#83:1>
All the creatures nearby gathered to see this strange bird .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#84:1>
Someone asked , &ldquo; What is it ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#85:1>
Is it a hen or a cock ? &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#86:1>
&ldquo; Cocks don't have so many colours , &rdquo; another
replied .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#87:1>
And these colours are all mixed up &dash; this thing is as ugly as
turkey .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#88:1>
No much uglier then a turkey . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#89:1>
Gigi then fanned out the long feathers on her tail . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#90:1>
&ldquo; Em ... must be a miniature turkey-vulture ...

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#91:1>
now it  ' s screaming .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#92:1>
It must be mentally ill . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#93:1>
&ldquo; <-> It  ' s </-> <+> Its </+> feathers are so untidy and
dirty ...

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#94:1>
you can see it doesn't even wash itself . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#95:1>
All the animals were whispering .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#96:1>
They didn't speak loudly because they didn't know whether the weird
looking animal was dangerous . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#97:1>
Gigi saw her parents perched on a branch .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#98:1>
&ldquo; What  ' s that ugly monster ? &rdquo; her mother said .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#99:1>
&ldquo; It might bite someone , where  ' s our daughter .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#100:1>
We better find her immediately . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#101:1>
Gigi  ' s entire family flew off to find her . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#102:1>
Gigi was miserable .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#103:1>
The other animals insulted her and not even her own parents
recognised her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#104:1>
She quickly flew away , the hubbub of murmurs and whispers fading as
she left the forest .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#105:1>
Her plan was a complete failure .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#106:1>
She flew as far as she could &dash; to a green savannah .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#107:1>
She landed and tried to leap forward , but she was very tired as she
hadn't enough sleep for a month .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#108:1>
Her costume of fur and feathers weighed heavily on her little body .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#109:1>
Her face was wet , but she didn't know if it was from sweat or tears .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#110:1>
Finally she dropped to the ground beside a quiet river .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#111:1>
With difficulty , she stretched her neck and tried to drink some
water . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#112:1>
She was shocked by the image in the river .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#113:1>
An ugly bird appeared on the surface of the water and looked back at
her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#114:1>
Its eyes were half-closed and irregular , mismatched feathers and
bits of hair jutted out from its body .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#115:1>
A gust of wind came and blew some of the ugly bird  ' s feathers into
the air .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#116:1>
Gigi realised that the ugly bird was her own reflection .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#117:1>
She became frightened and quickly stripped the extra fur and
feathers from her body .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#118:1>
When she was finished , she found that she looked much prettier than
that monster .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#119:1>
She no longer felt upset .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#120:1>
Though her plan had failed , she was herself again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#121:1>
She had never felt so free .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#122:1>
She sang with her original voice and danced merrily . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#123:1>
Suddenly , she saw Bibsy and Moxy running towards her and
calling her name .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#124:1>
When they reached her , they spoke in unison : &ldquo; What are you
doing here ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#125:1>
Your parents were so worried about you .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#126:1>
Did you hear about the monster that appeared under the big tree this
morning ? &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#127:1>
Gigi didn't tell them what had happened &semi; she just followed
the rabbit twins back to the forest . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#128:1>
When she returned to the tree , many animals cheered , &ldquo;
Gigi  ' s back ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#129:1>
When her mother saw her , she gave her a big hug and cried out ,
&ldquo; Where have you been ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#130:1>
We looked everywhere .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#131:1>
We thought you had been snatched by the monster .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#132:1>
Don't leave the forest again , okay ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#133:1>
We couldn't bear it if something happened to you . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#134:1>
Gigi nodded her head and felt ashamed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#135:1>
When she looked around , she saw that there were many animals and
birds around her and they were all smiling .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#136:1>
She could feel the warmth of their love and concern .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#137:1>
She thought that she was the luckiest sparrow in the world . </p>
</I>

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#138:2>
<bold> A Dream that Never Comes True </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#139:2>
My mother came to my bedroom one cold , dark early morning and
woke me up .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#140:2>
She said , &ldquo; Wake up and prepare yourself quickly , your
granny has already arranged everything . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#141:2>
When I saw my granny  ' s cordial smile , my heart was deeply
warmed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#142:2>
Looking at her rosy face and brown curly hair , I could see why many
people said that she looked like a westerner .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#143:2>
When everything was ready , we began our journey to the Mainland .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#144:2>
Since my granny  ' s brother and sister lived there , she often liked
to go back to visit them and help them out .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#145:2>
On the way to the train station , I could smell the fresh air and
taste the strong , freezing wind .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#146:2>
As walked through the station , I took several pieces of luggage in
one hand , and I used the other hand to hold my granny  ' s arm as firmly as
possible as I was afraid that I might lose her . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#147:2>
We took an old-fashioned train .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#148:2>
Inside , there were wooden tables and the chairs were covered with
thick , brown leather .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#149:2>
Outside it was still dark .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#150:2>
I could only see a sea of scattered lights and the dim-yellow light
of the setting moon that illuminated the compartment .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#151:2>
I really wanted to stay awake and see the scenery , but I could not
keep my eyes open , and finally I fell asleep in my granny  ' s arms . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#152:2>
When we arrived in Chungshan , I thought I was being put in a
refrigerator when I got outside .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#153:2>
My toes were frozen even though they were buried beneath a pair of
thick socks &semi; and I could feel my teeth were shaking too !

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#154:2>
We rode in the back of a three-wheel vehicle for nearly an hour
before arriving in front of a big house .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#155:2>
My granny  ' s brother was already waiting for us at the door .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#156:2>
That evening , we were served many special dishes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#157:2>
The taste of the fried fish balls and wonton impressed me very much .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#158:2>
I had never tasted such delicious flavours before . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#159:2>
Later that night , we had to shut the windows and door of the
bedroom so we could bathe using water from a small pot .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#160:2>
It was not as convenient as taking a shower at home , but I found it
was quite fun .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#161:2>
Although there were a number of bedrooms in the house , I still
decided to sleep with my granny in one bedroom .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#162:2>
Sleeping next to her made me feel very warm and safe . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#163:2>
I slept well , and the next day , my granny took me to have
morning tea with her brother .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#164:2>
I was not accustomed to the food of the Chinese restaurant there ,
but I thought it was still a good experience for me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#165:2>
I could see the elderly men coming to have morning tea with their
caged birds .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#166:2>
The voices of the people and songs of the birds enlivened the
atmosphere .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#167:2>
When we had finished the tea , I got a chance to admire the
landscape on our way home , the scenery was really attractive ...... </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#168:2>
The alarm clock woke me up suddenly , but I was left with the
clear picture of my dream . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#169:2>
It was an unforgettable trip , wasn't it ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#170:2>
My granny , however , had passed away nearly three years before .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#171:2>
And though she had been back to China many times , I hadn't gone
with her once .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#172:2>
I always dream of her , and whenever she visits my dreams , we do
many things that we never did when she was still alive .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#173:2>
Although she has left me for a long time , the rough sketch of her
face still floats on my mind like a beautiful picture .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#174:2>
And I am glad I can still share my feelings with her even now . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-008#175:2>
I can still remember seeing her pale but beautiful face when she
was in the hospital .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#176:2>
When her hands slipped away from my hands , I knew I would only be
able to touch her again in my dreams .

<ICE-HK:W2F-008#177:2>
All villagers attended and they mourned him , but none of his
children were there to see their father for the last time . </p> </I>
