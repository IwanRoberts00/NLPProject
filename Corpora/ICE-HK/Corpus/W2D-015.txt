<bold> We all have creative moments but making more of your inner
artist by attending a class provides a relaxing escape from working life and
, as an added bonus , you can walk away from a course with something to
decorate your home or send to your mother . </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#5:1>
&ldquo; Art is a tart ! &rdquo; , I once read on a postcard .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#6:1>
And while it  ' s certainly true that in Hong Kong most creative courses
seem to attract more women than men , you guys really shouldn't get left
behind .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#7:1>
Getting in touch with your feminine side is a necessary accomplishment
for all 21st century self-respecting blokes .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#8:1>
After all , macramé is the new golf , and being able to make a tissue
box cover out of loo rolls , old shirts , ribbons and doilies looks great on
you CV , not to mention the back shelf of your BMW . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#9:1>
So <it> Winners </it> bravely went where few men have gone before
and met some good looking , bloke-friendly , hot-to-trot evening  ' s
entertainment .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#10:1>
And the courses aren't bad either... </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#12:1>
Learning to depict the human figure takes you at once to the most
basic necessities and yet most enduring complex tasks of drawing .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#13:1>
You don't have to read the <it> Karma Sutra </it> &obrack;  although you
might like to for - ahem - research purposes &cbrack; to know there is an infinite
number of positions the human body can get knotted up into . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#14:1>
So there you are , sitting in a cosy relaxed studio with your
sketchpad on your knees and apiece of charcoal in your hand , and suddenly a
model walks in , starkers .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#15:1>
After your eyes have stopped widening at the fact that you have a
live nude person in front of you without the pay-to-view channel on , force
yours hands down from your mouth , silencing your gasp &obrack;  or back from under
your sketch pad... &cbrack; , and shakily pick up your drawing implement from where
it has fallen on the floor .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#16:1>
Now you have to regain eye-hand coordination and start sketching .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#17:1>
&ldquo; Draw what you see , not what you know , &rdquo; says Norm Yip
, artist , architect and photographer , who holds the life drawing sessions
at his studio - Studio 8 .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#18:1>
" Break free of perceptions of what something is supposed to look
like . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#19:1>
It  ' s difficult , it  ' s a challenge , but at the same time it is
quiet and therapeutic and the best thing is that you don't have to get it
right .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#20:1>
There is no pressure .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#21:1>
&ldquo; Don't try to make a Picasso , &rdquo; warns Norm .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#22:1>
No one but you need see your attempts and you  ' ll find after a few
warm-up exercises you get more confident and soon you  ' ll be throwing out
pictures of slightly alien looking hybrid forms of the human being with gusto .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#23:1>
John McArthur , a teacher , has been taking lessons at Studio 8
for a while.

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#24:1>
&ldquo; A life session is a little like an artistic workout , &rdquo;
he said .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#25:1>
&ldquo; For me it is total relaxation - meditation for the want of a
better way .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#26:1>
Nothing else matters when you are involved in the drawing process .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#27:1>
Everything is form , shape and smudged shades on paper .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#28:1>
Hopefully when I have finished it is something that makes sense to me .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#29:1>
<bold> Life Drawing Tips </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#30:1>
? Start by picking out geometric shapes just to get the essence .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#31:1>
? Then try moving your hand very fast in scratchy strokes .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#32:1>
Wherever your eye goes make your hand go . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#33:1>
? Try contour drawing: follow a line very slowly and draw without
picking your pencil up off the paper , or even looking to see what you are
doing .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#34:1>
This trains the eye to be more sensitive . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#35:1>
? Don't try to make your sketch perfect . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#36:1>
? Don't let a drawing control you; you control it . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#37:1>
<bold> Paints , Music , Wine , Action ! </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#38:1>
For a riotous Saturday night unlike any you have had before ,
take your normal weekend night out , and to the staple ingredients of alcohol
, music and friendly banter with the ever-present hope of some steamy action
later on , and just add paint . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#39:1>
Tony Smyth and friends , in one corner of the packed Meli Melo
gallery have come to Art Jam for the first time .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#40:1>
Nervously looking at his blank canvas Smyth tells me how he feels .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#41:1>
&ldquo; You  ' ll have to find a synonym for shitting yourself !
&rdquo; he laughs , adding , &ldquo; we were finding inspiration in Dublin
Jacks until a few moments ago . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#42:1>
Across the room , Gallant Nein , an accountant , has been dragged
along by a female friend who is a regular  ' art jammer ' .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#43:1>
While she deftly paints a professional-looking abstract number which
to my untrained eye could easily sell for thousands in the right frame and
right gallery , he is painting something rather different .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#44:1>
&ldquo; I  ' m not going for beauty , &rdquo; he understates
disarmingly .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#45:1>
&ldquo; This is the best way to describe what  ' s been on my mind
recently - personal emotions , and voices I  ' m dealing with right now .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#46:1>
It  ' s a way of thinking - thinking on canvas , and that  ' s why it  ' s
such a good release . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#47:1>
At first it  ' s hard to let go of the conventional desire to
create something as perfect as possible but here , with an unlimited amount
of paint &obrack;  and wine &cbrack; , as the evening progresses it doesn't matter if you are
finishing your very first masterpiece or on your tenth layer of paint .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#48:1>
It  ' s all about flinging your hands in the air and having fun , and
if that means getting more paint on yourself and your friends than the canvas
, then go ahead ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#49:1>
So popular now , these evenings are often completely full so make
sure you book ahead of time .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#50:1>
It seems everyone wants to create their own piece of art .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#51:1>
Smyth has painted an fawn-coloured abstract for his dogs , the same
colour as the carpet they love to chew .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#52:1>
He stands back and admires it .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#53:1>
&ldquo; Now what I want to know is how do get into a taxi with one of
these ? &rdquo; </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#54:1>
<bold> How to Art Jam </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#55:1>
? Don't rush into anything .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#56:1>
Think about what you want to create before slapping the paint on .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#57:1>
? Don't take it too seriously .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#58:1>
No one is judging you , so have fun . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#59:1>
? Use a plastic scraper as well as or instead of a brush for a
different effect . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#60:1>
? If it doesn't turn out how you wanted it , come back and try
again another time . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#61:1>
? Hey , why not try painting with the red wine just to see what
happens ?

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#62:1>
One sip for you .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#63:1>
One splash for the canvas . </p> <O> Five photos </O> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#64:1>
<bold> Getting to Grips with Clay </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#65:1>
? Relax , enjoy the feeling of the clay and getting messy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#66:1>
? With hand-building you can make anything at all , look for
inspiration from the objects around you . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#67:1>
? Be calm and have a steady hand for throwing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#68:1>
? Painting on a coloured or multi-coloured glaze on a finished
piece is an art in itself . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#69:1>
? The result relies on the temperature of the kiln and the
thickness of the glaze .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#70:1>
You can't always control it - which is part of the fun .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#71:1>
So be prepared for the unexpected ! </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#72:1>
<bold> Going to Pot </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#73:1>
<it> Ghost </it> it  ' s not , and anyway Patrick Swazi is soooo
Eighties - in fact , to begin with , it  ' ll be more Robert de Niro  ' s
laughable attempts at crockery creation in <it> Showtime </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#74:1>
But don't despair .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#75:1>
Queenie at the Pottery Workshop is there to lend an encouraging word
and help you find your inner potter .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#76:1>
In any case there  ' s no need to panic , the creative moment is
delayed by some good old-fashioned physical hard work .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#77:1>
Wedging and pinching , coiling and slab - building , may sound like
you should be on a building site with your trousers half way down your arse
and hobnail boots on - but this is where pottery gets macho .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#78:1>
To begin with you have to wedge or work the clay to make it pliable
enough to shape before you can talk the terms that refer to creative output -
making that wobbly bowl , lop-sided ashtray or three-legged dog that you can
give your auntie for her birthday .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#79:1>
Throwing , or using the wheel , is for later when you have a feel for
the clay . Eddie Lui , product designer , did pottery at college and has
recently taken it up again .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#80:1>
He loves the challenge of producing a piece and finds the flexibility
of clay fun .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#81:1>
&ldquo; But most importantly it  ' s another world to go into , &rdquo;
he says .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#82:1>
&ldquo; Although there are other people there , when you are doing
your piece you don't see them .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#83:1>
You are in your own world .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#84:1>
It  ' s very relaxing and inspiring . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#85:1>
Looking round the room three are indeed a few strange things
among the breathtakingly professional looking bottles , vases and bowls that
you might be aspiring to .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#86:1>
&ldquo; There are so many possibilities in working with clay .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#87:1>
More than with throwing where you are confined by the wheel , so you
can't make strange organic forms , &rdquo; Queenie explains , reading my mind .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#88:1>
&ldquo; It is fun to make something and then take it home and use it .
&rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#89:1>
Or let it collect dust , I think to myself of my own heroic attempts .

<bold> Focusing on Photography </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#91:1>
Improve your pictures immediately by: ? Understanding the
controls of your camera . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#92:1>
? Pre-visualising .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#93:1>
See the result you want in your imagination , eg . - how to express a
tree: in sharp detail or with blur from the wind ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#94:1>
? Using light correctly by being aware of the different effects
it has depending on which angle you are looking/shooting form . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#95:1>
? Concentrating on the composition .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#96:1>
There is never just one picture of something of someone .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#97:1>
Move around and change the angles . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#98:1>
? Getting in close and looking at details . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#99:1>

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#100:1>
In Hong Kong the important things in life are the sleekest
sports cars , the fastest laptops and the finest mobiles , right ?

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#101:1>
Never get between a man and his gadgets , as they say .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#102:1>
But in photography , having a billion mega-pixels isn't necessarily
going to get you the best picture , so said Henri Cartier Bresson back in the
early 1900s &obrack;  well , perhaps not in quite the same words &cbrack; and so says
Dominique Harris now . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#103:1>
The Hong Kong-born photographer has been into photography since
she was a teenager when she was toting a completely manual camera , &ldquo;
no auto-focus , I had to do everything , &rdquo; she explains .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#104:1>
&ldquo; These days most people use their camera  ' in programme ' but
you end up with pictures that are averaged out - factory designed - because
people have no idea what the camera is doing .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#105:1>
The key is to work in manual and take control .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#106:1>
It  ' s easy to master . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#107:1>
She holds classes at the Island School Evening Institute and the
Hong Kong Arts Centre covering basic technicalities and darkroom techniques
to start with and then going on to encourage people to be creative .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#108:1>
&ldquo; Anyone can take a picture - it  ' s just creating ones that
are more memorable , &rdquo; she says .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#109:1>
&ldquo; See a scene and replicate your impression rather than just
recording it .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#110:1>
Play with depth of field , movement , light . &rdquo; </p> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#112:1>
Local photographer Dominique Harris recommends a look at: ?
Henri Cartier Bresson - granddaddy of black-and-white documentary photography .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#113:1>
Everyone knows his famous kiss shot . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#114:1>
? Garry Winogrand - American photojournalist renowned for his  ' uncomposed'
contemporary life shots . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#115:1>
? Emmett Gowin - best known for large format spontaneous family
photographs . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#116:1>
? Joel Mawrowitz - street photographer and pioneer of colour
photography . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#117:1>
? Cindy Sherman - voyeuristic pictures with a feeling of film
stills . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#118:1>
Magnus Ng , a former student , is hooked .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#119:1>
&ldquo; After the course , I found that photography opportunities
actually exist all around us and in our daily life .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#120:1>
Now I usually carry a small camera with me everywhere so as not to
miss a photo opportunity."

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#121:1>
He went on , &ldquo; the course encouraged me to try street
photography and black-and-white photography which I had never attempted
before .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#122:1>
I framed some of the pictures I took and hung them up at home .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#123:1>
I really like being able to always see my pictures when I get back
from work . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#124:1>
So if you don't want to end up with a whole album of hit-or-miss
snaps after your next trip to Bali , or your family picnic or weekend hike ,
then make your history memorable and learn how to take real works of art .
</p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#125:1>
<bold> Sharpening Artistic Awareness </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#126:1>
? Look around you . Artists get inspiration from their
environment , nature , people , everything . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#127:1>
? Visit some art galleries; try walking along Hollywood Rd. ,
where numerous commercial galleries are happy for you to look around . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#128:1>
? Really look art pieces; analyse what you like and don't like
about them .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#129:1>
This will make it easier for you to produce something you like
yourself . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#130:1>
? Be proactive .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#131:1>
Instead of being a couch potato get up and go out with a camera or
paper and pen and experiment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#132:1>
? There  ' s no wrong or right in art .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#133:1>
Rules are made to be broken and mistakes may lead to the most
interesting pieces of all . </p> <h>

<bold> Exposing Your Stuff </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-015#135:1>
Arranging an exhibition is not the preserve of a professional
artist .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#136:1>
There are plenty of spaces around town where you have your own show
or a group show with a few art classmates .

<ICE-HK:W2D-015#137:1>
