<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X1:1:Z>
Stan thanks very much for coming along with this morning

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X2:1:Z>
It  ' s great to see you

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X3:1:Z>
Thank you very much indeed </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-072#4:1:A>
Oh I  ' m happy to meet you Kingsley

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X5:1:Z>
Uhm I would

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X6:1:Z>
The reason I ask you to come along was because I just join the uh
Senior Common Room committee the SCR committee

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X7:1:Z>
And as you know I got uhm <,> I got a meeting with them later this
week to discuss the business plan

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X8:1:Z>
So I thought I may talk to you about it first and then uh you could
<?> fill </?> me about some of the <,> the details some of the developments
that  ' s been going on uh in in in the last year or so

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X9:1:Z>
Uhm maybe you could just give me an idea Stan

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X10:1:Z>
What  ' s what  ' s the general picture like at the moment about the
the finances and so on of of the SCR </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-072#11:1:A>
Well the uh the finance situation in SCR is not <,> doing too
well honestly

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#12:1:A>
Uh ever since well you know Hong Kong having uh a depression for
last few years and then you had incident of the uh nine one one incident and
that really uh psychologically withdraw a lot of people from from us too and
then later on I mean for the last few months Sars problem which business down
around forty percent <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> uh which is not too bad in comparing
with other <,> <unc> one word </unc> outlet though they down about
sixty seventy eighty percent as you <{2> <[2> can </[2> see on TV or read on
newspaper <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#13:1:A>
So we are struggling in in that sense we are <{4> <[4> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#14:1:A>
Yes </[4>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X15:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X16:1:Z>
<[2> Right </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X17:1:Z>
<[3> Right </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X18:1:Z>
<[4> Yeah </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X19:1:Z>
So how about the uh how about the profit uh profit or loss <,>
situation uh

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X20:1:Z>
What  ' s the general picture being in the last few years and as far
as uh <,> showing the <.> pro </.> profit

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X21:1:Z>
Are you supposed to be <,> a profit making organization or or <,>
as the philosophy changes there so it was it  ' s originally a non profit
organization and it  ' s now become a profit making organization or maybe you
can give me a little background uh <{> <[> about </[> that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-072#22:1:A>
<[> Right </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#23:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#24:1:A>
That  ' s a very good question Kingsley

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#25:1:A>
Uh we are not we are a non profit organization in in in in that
sense but we do want to have a balanced budget because don't forget we are uh
financially independent <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#26:1:A>
We have a subvention from university and you know with no rent pay
and other maintenance help and all that

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#27:1:A>
But uh real <?> moneyize </?> we need to have pure some kind of
reserve <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> for whatever happen like in running a <?> F& S
<.> busi </.> </?> you do need that kind of reserve because for example of
sudden a major equipment breakdown <{2> <[2> <,> and </[2> that is a major
cost <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#28:1:A>
And no one could help you so we have to dig it out from the reserve

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#29:1:A>
So if you look at the back of one of the pages uh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X30:1:Z>
<[1> Right </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X31:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X32:1:Z>
<[3> Right </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X33:1:Z>
Of the business report </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-072#34:1:A>
Of the business report

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#35:1:A>
<{1> <[1> That  ' s </[1> it show uh uh the last twelve years I  ' ve
been here uh eight years we are making some money and put in the reserve

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#36:1:A>
That  ' s why the reserve build up by one point some million dollars
as up today <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#37:1:A>
But these four years including last two years we  ' ve been having a
difficult time

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#38:1:A>
<{3> <[3> That means </[3> we were in the red <{4> <[4> <,> </[4>
okay including this year and <?> probable </?> the year to come

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X39:1:Z>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X40:1:Z>
<[2> Right </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X41:1:Z>
<[3> Right </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X42:1:Z>
<[4> Yeah </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X43:1:Z>
Uh but you still have a reserve of over million of Hong Kong
dollars <{> <[> is that right </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-072#44:1:A>
<[> Yes we do </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#45:1:A>
Yes we do

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X46:1:Z>
So the general picture is I guess that uhm until about the the
Asia turndown which is ninety eight then the SCR was doing okay basically
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-072#47:1:A>
Uh you can say that <{1> <[1> yeah </[1> you can say that <{2>
<[2> yeah </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X48:1:Z>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X49:1:Z>
<[2> So </[2> </{2> it  ' s really since ninety <?> since </?> the
last four years or so but uhm since uhm since we go into uh <,,> to uh lost
<?> anything </?> period </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-072#50:1:A>
Well uh if you want to dig out this chart <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#51:1:A>
The actual surplus deficits the budget for the last twelve years

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#52:1:A>
Uh <,> in even in year two thousand and nineteen ninety nine we  ' re
making money

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#53:1:A>
<{2> <[2> We </[2> have a a a reserve left <{3> <[3> okay </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#54:1:A>
Uh just last year and this year <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> and would last
year was like point eight thousand and two hundred eighty thousand deficit

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X55:1:Z>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X56:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X57:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X58:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X59:1:Z>
Two hundred eighty <{> <[> thousand </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X60:1:Z>
Right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-072#61:1:A>
<[> Right </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#62:1:A>
This year would pretty well expect the same

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#63:1:A>
A little bit less because the last few months were pretty awful
because the Sars problem

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X64:1:Z>
Right <,> yeah

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X65:1:Z>
How what what how  ' s the membership uh developed over the over the
last uh few years

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X66:1:Z>
How many how many members do we have in the uh Senior Common Room
these days </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-072#67:1:A>
Well we have over thousand and <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#68:1:A>
Honestly uh <,> we <,> in my business plan it mention that in uh
year nineteen ninety seven there were twelve hundred and twelve members <{1>
<[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#69:1:A>
And today in two O O year two O O three that  ' s eleven and forty

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#70:1:A>
<{2> <[2> So </[2> there  ' s a slight drop <{3> <[3> of </[3> the
membership

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X71:1:Z>
<[1> Right </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X72:1:Z>
<[2> Right </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X73:1:Z>
<[3> Yeah </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X74:1:Z>
And the majority those members are <,> uh academic majority was
our teachers or other all kinds of other people as well as administrators and
uh an office staff and uh <?> staff </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X75:1:Z>
What what what  ' s the background of the membership </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-072#76:1:A>
Well you are really you are really uh stated that the most
them uh

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#77:1:A>
The members <?> consil </?> of uhm <,> I mean sorry consist of
different type uh of senior staff <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> means professors lector
doctor high administrator office people well <{2> <[2> people </[2> of high
rank and contractual staff along they are involve teaching and <,> in in
university certain grade and above <{3> <[3> they </[3> they entitle to
become our <{4> <[4> member </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#78:1:A>
Of course in last few year we also open up membership for like
<unc> one word </unc> membership alumni membership and also <unc>
one word </unc> membership <{5> <[5> which is </[5> non academic staff
membership we give them a quota <{6> <[6> which </[6> in

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#79:1:A>
We try to expand the membership that  ' s why we include of them <{7>
<[7> we  ' re not </[7> supposed to but we did anyway <{8> <[8> <,> </[8>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#80:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X81:1:Z>
<[1> Right </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X82:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X83:1:Z>
<[3> Right </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X84:1:Z>
<[4> Yeah </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X85:1:Z>
<[5> Right </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X86:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X87:1:Z>
<[7> Yeah </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X88:1:Z>
<[8> Yeah </[8> </{8>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X89:1:Z>
So uh <,> yeah so <.> ex </.>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X90:1:Z>
So maybe uh seventy percent academics and thirty percent the rest
<?> percent </?> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-072#91:1:A>
True <unc> one word </unc>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X92:1:Z>
Yeah I see right

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X93:1:Z>
So Stan what are the main what are the main points that I should
uh

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X94:1:Z>
What are the main points I should uh look at and uh and take
notice of your business plan this year </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-072#95:1:A>
Okay for this year uh there  ' s two major area we should look
at

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#96:1:A>
One is cost saving <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#97:1:A>
Cost saving means uh <,> the manager would work closely with the uh
<,> with my left and right hand that means the bar captain and the chef

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#98:1:A>
<{2> <[2> Both </[2> twos are the one who order from the supply
<{3> <[3> okay </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#99:1:A>
We have I have to monitor closely <{4> <[4> that </[4> we are
getting stuff they  ' re value of money <{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#100:1:A>
Okay or a very good price <{6> <[6> <,> so </[6> in a long run
that would save that that means cost saving because <{7> <[7> we </[7>
getting thing cheaper <{8> <[8> <,> </[8> than what it is now

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#101:1:A>
<{9> <[9> Of </[9> course then you need a lot of pushing and a lot
of convincing <{10> <[10> to </[10> the supplies and all that

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#102:1:A>
So that  ' s saving right that

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#103:1:A>
And also the major problem as I consulted with other counters in
the business

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#104:1:A>
When they look at the uh countering statement they just said wah
you know <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#105:1:A>
In the year time the uh the volume of business okay <{11> <[11>
<,> </[11> is over ten million dollars <{12> <[12> okay </[12> in the year
time <{13> <[13> <,> </[13>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#106:1:A>
But the uh staff cost is seventy percent <{14> <[14> <,> </[14>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#107:1:A>
Seventy percent <{15> <[15> believe </[15> it or not

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#108:1:A>
I mean if you take that out in any other <unc> one word
</unc> in Hong Kong no way they could run it <{16> <[16> like that </[16>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#109:1:A>
But because we do have subsidy or uh subvention from university
and its rent free and other maintenance we we get it from nothing <{17> <[17>
from </[17> <.> uni </.> university like a lot of help from university to
support us

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#110:1:A>
But still the major <,> the major problem lies on the staff cost
<{18> <[18> <,> </[18> which in a way I  ' m kind of happy because <,> kind of
happy not <.> hap </.> personally I  ' m not because I get my salary cut like
most of people because as you know the university pays scale is linked with
government <{19> <[19> civil </[19> servants <{20> <[20> pays </[20> scale
and we have a six percent cut in the next two years

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#111:1:A>
<{21> <[21> Three </[21> percent this year and three percent for
the year to come <{22> <[22> <,> </[22> which help to do I mean which help
the SCR because <{23> <[23> that  ' s </[23> cost saving right there

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#112:1:A>
And uh I did suggest to the committee last year in my last
business plan and <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#113:1:A>
At that we should really look at the staff cost and like <unc>
three words </unc> institute in Hong Kong University in other independent
uh department

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#114:1:A>
They <unc> three words </unc> especially they ask they
request or they submit a ten percent staff cost cut <{24> <[24> <,> </[24>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#115:1:A>
Okay because they were not doing too good themselves a year ago
two years ago <{25> <[25> uh </[25>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X116:1:Z>
<[1> Right </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X117:1:Z>
<[2> Right </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X118:1:Z>
<[3> Right </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X119:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X120:1:Z>
<[5> Right </[5> </{5>

They are <{1> <[1> financial </[1> independent <{2> <[2> they

<?> or or </?> questionnaire yeah </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-072#161:1:A>
<[> Something like that and they have ask for </[> </{> ten
percent cut so <{1> <[1> in order </[1> to balance the budget you <{2> <[2>
know </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#162:1:A>
So you can see that

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#163:1:A>
For example if I tell people which I have told many time to other
people friends of my in the industry that I pay right now the SCR  ' s pay not
I pay sorry

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#164:1:A>
SCR pay eleven thousand a month for a cleaner <{3> <[3> and </[3>
they <?> fee out </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#165:1:A>
<{4> <[4> As </[4> a university graduate even <?> nowaday </?> in
Hong Kong don't get that kind of salary <{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#166:1:A>
Some of them may <?> otherwise </?> <{6> <[6> <,> </[6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#167:1:A>
Okay so you can see the difficult <,> the how difficult it is to
run <{7> <[7> the </[7> SCR would have a balanced budget

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#168:1:A>
<{8> <[8> That  ' s all </[8> <,> the time now <{9> <[9> you </[9>
see the present time

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#169:1:A>
And uh so I mention the cost cutting so this is it

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#170:1:A>
Two major area is the staff cost and of course cut down the cost
of supply <?> and say </?> we would be <{10> <[10> would be </[10> order
stuff

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#171:1:A>
We try to be <?> very </?> careful <{11> <[11> we get </[11> very
little money so that  ' s <{12> <[12> two </[12> issue we have to look at <{13>
<[13> <,> </[13>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#172:1:A>
On the other side there also uh uh <,> we have to think a way of
increasing business <{14> <[14> okay </[14>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#173:1:A>
So I have some new services here hopefully to increase business of
the SCR in future <{15> <[15> <,> </[15>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#174:1:A>
For example we do have to spend a bit of money in modifying the
snooker room which is <,> hardly used

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#175:1:A>
<{16> <[16> It  ' s </[16> a beautiful space and I suggest to turn
it to a cyber cafe <{17> <[17> <,> </[17> but it was kind of turndown

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#176:1:A>
And now we have a proposal to change the big seminar room <{18>
<[18> which </[18> I think it might work <{19> <[19> with </[19> a rental fee
of course

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#177:1:A>
<{20> <[20> And </[20> then we provide <unc> one word
</unc> <{21> <[21> service there </[21>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#178:1:A>
So but that cost <?> would </?> maybe uh two hundred thousand
dollars so whether the committee will approve it or not does in the future
but the suggestions there <{22> <[22> <,> </[22>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#179:1:A>
Also we should think of some new services

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#180:1:A>
For example something to attract the member to come back and use
it more frequent <{23> <[23> <,> </[23>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#181:1:A>
Uh for example the noodle bar <{24> <[24> which is </[24> a a
fresh noodle bar we call that means in the canteen from Monday to Friday we
would do a fresh noodle bar with the choice of uh ingredient for mere twenty
five dollar with a big bowl <{25> <[25> <,> </[25> which is I done a research
around which for <?> qualitize </?> and <?> priceize </?> would be <{26>
<[26> <,> </[26> the the thing to buy <{27> <[27> <,> </[27> you know

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#182:1:A>
Because it  ' s fresh <{28> <[28> and </[28> you have a great choice
and <{29> <[29> it  ' s </[29> only twenty five dollar would feed you well so
<{30> <[30> as </[30> one <{31> <[31> lunch </[31>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#183:1:A>
Okay and <,> everything is set up there it  ' s been <{32> <[32> out
</[32>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X184:1:Z>
<[1> Right </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X185:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X186:1:Z>
<[3> Right </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X187:1:Z>
<[4> Yeah </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X188:1:Z>
<[5> Right </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X189:1:Z>
<[6> Right </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X190:1:Z>
<[7> Yeah </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X191:1:Z>
<[8> Right </[8> </{8>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X192:1:Z>
<[9> Yeah </[9> </{9>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X193:1:Z>
<[10> Uhm </[10> </{10>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X194:1:Z>
<[11> Uhm </[11> </{11>

<[17> Uhm </[17> </{17>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X201:1:Z>
<[18> Uhm </[18> </{18>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X202:1:Z>
<[19> Uhm </[19> </{19>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X203:1:Z>
<[20> Uhm </[20> </{20>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X204:1:Z>
<[21> Uhm uhm </[21> </{21>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X205:1:Z>
<[22> Uhm </[22> </{22>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X206:1:Z>
<[23> Uhm </[23> </{23>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X207:1:Z>
<[24> Uhm </[24> </{24>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X208:1:Z>
<[25> Right </[25> </{25>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X209:1:Z>
<[26> Uhm </[26> </{26>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X210:1:Z>
<[27> Uhm </[27> </{27>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X211:1:Z>
<[28> Uhm </[28> </{28>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X212:1:Z>
<[29> Uhm </[29> </{29>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X213:1:Z>
<[30> Uhm </[30> </{30>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X214:1:Z>
<[31> Uhm </[31> </{31>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X215:1:Z>
<[32> So </[32> </{32> that noodle bar is <?> opened </?> at
lunch time only <{> <[> or </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-072#216:1:A>
<[> Lunch </[> </{> time only <{> <[> yeah yeah </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#217:1:A>
Everything is set up like the uh the stove been built and the uh
air conditioning uh at that point at that <&> The first tape ends </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X218:1:Z>
<[> I see right </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X219:1:Z>
Uhm <,> what  ' s make you think it  ' s going to make a profit

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X220:1:Z>
<?> Are you sure </?> if people is choosing to buy noodles at
twenty five dollars a meal <{> <[> then </[> <unc> one word </unc>
and you only serving at lunch time then they may not buy the other lunch from
you but you make the better profit or not </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-072#221:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#222:1:A>
Uh yes or no

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#223:1:A>
But the the noodle bar have a better profit margin than other
dishes you know

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#224:1:A>
<{1> <[1> And </[1> it  ' s easy to make and the <unc> one word
</unc> hardly end of wastage

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#225:1:A>
<{2> <[2> It  ' s </[2> not like cooking up a Chinese dish or stream
fish for example

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#226:1:A>
<{3> <[3> Let  ' s </[3> say we we we have twenty uh fresh fish to
be served stream fish today <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> and we only serve fifteen

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#227:1:A>
<{5> <[5> The </[5> other five pretty well wasted <{6> <[6> for
</[6> the uh <.> subs </.> <unc> one word </unc> <{7> <[7> merely
</[7>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#228:1:A>
But for the fresh noodle bar we can use it again tomorrow without
any kind of bad effect okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#229:1:A>
And the profit margin is much higher than selling fish and other
sea food other dishes the Chinese dishes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X230:1:Z>
<[1> And </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X231:1:Z>
<[2> Right </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X232:1:Z>
<[3> Right </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X233:1:Z>
<[4> Right </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X234:1:Z>
<[5> Yeah </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X235:1:Z>
<[6> Right </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X236:1:Z>
<[7> Right </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X237:1:Z>
Right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-072#238:1:A>
Yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X239:1:Z>
So what kind of noodles are you selling now </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-072#240:1:A>
We would have uh <,> we probably have uh three different kind
of noodle like the <?> oily </?> noodle the wonton noodle and <unc> one
word </unc> <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> and also ingredient choice in noodle
would be like fish ball and uh <,> uh shrimp <{2> <[2> dumping </[2> and beef
ball and <,> and <?> wanton </?> wonton <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#241:1:A>
What do we call yeah so people have a choice

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#242:1:A>
<{4> <[4> They </[4> can have just a bowl wonton noodle <{5> <[5>
or </[5> they can have uh noodle with three different kind of ingredient

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#243:1:A>
All for the same price <{6> <[6> <,> </[6> and it  ' s fresh you
know <{7> <[7> people </[7> can see <,> see them being made right in front of
you <{8> <[8> so </[8> people like the idea you know

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#244:1:A>
It  ' s like the fresh pass the bar in the bar area we serve every
Friday night

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#245:1:A>
We prove it to be very successful <{9> <[9> <,> yeah </[9>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X246:1:Z>
<[1> Uh ha </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X247:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X248:1:Z>
<[3> Yeah </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X249:1:Z>
<[4> Right </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X250:1:Z>
<[5> Right </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X251:1:Z>
<[6> Yeah </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X252:1:Z>
<[7> Right </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X253:1:Z>
<[8> Uhm </[8> </{8>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X254:1:Z>
<[9> Right

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X255:1:Z>
I </[9> </{9> think it  ' s going to be three sort of information

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X256:1:Z>
One was the uh converting uh snooker <{1> <[1> room </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X257:1:Z>
Second was uh doing the noodle bar <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and third
one </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-072#258:1:A>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#259:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#260:1:A>
And the third one we  ' re go uh we we

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#261:1:A>
This is we go to try uh delivery service <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>
within campus only <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and a take out menu so people can
download from the website and <{3> <[3> send </[3> us a fax and <,> <{4> <[4>
pick </[4> up order

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#262:1:A>
And when they arrive the order is there <{5> <[5> <,> </[5> for
them to pick up <?> within </?> it  ' s fast and convenience <{6> <[6> <,>
</[6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#263:1:A>
Aiming at the present time university staff especially academic
staff are getting busier <{7> <[7> and </[7> they had more work to do

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#264:1:A>
So they had less time for you know for leisure lunch or sit there
<{8> <[8> for </[8> forty five minutes an hour to have <{9> <[9> lunch </[9>
like they have before <{10> <[10> <,> </[10>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#265:1:A>
Instead a lot of people told us and the staff like the staff and
myself that they they they get very busy <{11> <[11> and </[11> they need to
have lunch

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#266:1:A>
<{12> <[12> A lot </[12> of them bring their own lunch to save the
uh you know coming up and order it

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#267:1:A>
<{13> <[13> But </[13> if you can provide a fast service of food
<{14> <[14> and </[14> good food of course and they will come up and pick it
up you know

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#268:1:A>
And also delivery service <?> are cost </?> a minimum to it and we
will deliver a certain given kind <{15> <[15> to </[15> other depart to any
department or members of staff <{16> <[16> <,> </[16> within a campus <{17>
<[17> <,> </[17> okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#269:1:A>
<{18> <[18> That </[18> will save that be time saving for them
<{19> <[19> <,> </[19> and also a group of people in the office would have we
would have a new item like the rice box <{20> <[20> in Chinese </[20> <indig>
faahn hahp </indig> <&> This refers to a lunch box </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#270:1:A>
<{21> <[21> Uh </[21> lot of people love that uh you know uh would
would love to have something like that for lunch <{22> <[22> <,> </[22>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#271:1:A>
So uh we will provide that in the near future once it is approved
by the committee

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#272:1:A>
Then we will have <indig> faahn hahp </indig> <&> This refers to a
lunch box </&> or rice box to deliver to different department <{23> <[23> or
</[23> you know I can when I say department means because one person cannot
order and have a staff a staff of mine to walk like to <{24> <[24> twenty
minutes </[24> to deliver one rice box so that  ' s <,> that  ' s <{25> <[25>
need a minimum <?> yeah </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#273:1:A>
Well </[25> that  ' s hundred and fifty dollars

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X274:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-072#X275:1:Z>
<[2> Right </[2> </{2>
