<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-051#1:1:A>
Yes uh thank you Chairman

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#2:1:A>
Chairman I want to welcome the Foreign Secretary to this council and
to thank him to congratulate him for having the courage to have this open
meeting with us which none of your predecessors have ever dared to do
although of course the Governor does it regularly

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#3:1:A>
And uh as the Chairman said Foreign Secretary my question is on
citizenship

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#4:1:A>
During your very brief stay here I  ' m sure you have talked to a lot
of people

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#5:1:A>
And I think there is one issue <,> in which this community is united

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#6:1:A>
Uh if you talk about democracy and others you may hear different
views

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#7:1:A>
And even on the representativeness on on representation on the
Preparatory Committee of which the <.> de </.> pro-democracy lobby has been
completely excluded you will hear different views

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#8:1:A>
But on the question of British citizenship this whole council the
Hong Kong Government and the Governor we are completely solidly united

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#9:1:A>
We want your Government to reconsider offering full British
citizenship <,> to the three and a half million Hong Kong British subjects

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#10:1:A>
Not all of them will take it

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#11:1:A>
Some of them will want to be Chinese citizens

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#12:1:A>
Good luck to them

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#13:1:A>
But there are those who don't want to <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#14:1:A>
And Foreign Secretary earlier this afternoon when you spoke to the
two chambers of commerce you said that during your six months as Foreign
Secretary it only increased your admiration for the courage and the clarity
of vision with which Governor Patten has led this community <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#15:1:A>
Well <,> Governor Patten is solidly behind us

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#16:1:A>
Is nationality a blind spot of the Governor

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#17:1:A>
Or you think the Governor has been very seriously misguided

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#18:1:A>
And also <,> Foreign Secretary finally you said in your speech you
will discharge Britain  ' s responsibilities towards Hong Kong fully and
honourably

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#19:1:A>
How can you do that if you abandon Britain  ' s citizens to Chinese
Communist rule

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#20:1:A>
No independence no self-rule no autonomy no guarantee for
participation in the political affairs for for the rule of law for human
rights

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#21:1:A>
How can you do it Foreign Secretary <O> speech-by-Foreign-Secretary
</O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-051#22:1:A>
Chairman <{1> </[> <,> </[> yes

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#23:1:A>
My question is not on the British nationality selection scheme

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#24:1:A>
I  ' m sorry Foreign Secretary

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#25:1:A>
You are wrong

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#26:1:A>
I  ' m talking about full British citizenship for the three and a
half <{1> <[1> million </[1> Hong Kong <{2> <[2> citizens <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#27:1:A>
The scheme the <{3> <[3> BNSS </[3> is woefully <{4> <[4>
inadequate </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#28:1:A>
And of course if you would want to broaden that I mean that is a
<.> ri </.> a step in the right direction but I  ' m talking about your
government your country  ' s <{5> <[5> responsibility </[5> for the citizens
that you  ' re going to hand over to Chinese Communist rule <{6> <[6> <,> </[6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#29:1:A>
Do you not have a conscience

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#30:1:A>
Do you not think it  ' s disgraceful to hand these frightened people
over to a regime from which they fled and to which the British have given
them shelter for so many decades <O> speech-by-Foreign-Secretary </O>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X31:1:Z>
<[1> Well a short floor </[1> </{1> </X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X32:1:Z>
<[1> Yes </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X33:1:Z>
<[2> That  ' s what I  ' m talking about </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X34:1:Z>
<[3> uhm </[3> </{3>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X40:1:Z>
Are there any more questions for the Foreign Secretary on British
nationality and British citizenship <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X41:1:Z>
Christine Loh </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-051#42:1:B>
Uh Foreign Secretary there is particular problem with the
ethnic minorities as you well know

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#43:1:B>
Uh we are told by that community that there are perhaps no more
than three to four thousand uh Eurasians and people mainly from the Indian
sub-continent uhm who will be stateless

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#44:1:B>
It  ' ll be difficult and indeed they do not want to apply for uh
Chinese citizenship as such

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#45:1:B>
In view of the fact that this number is really now a very small
number is there really nothing that the British Government is going to do

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#46:1:B>
You did say just now Sir that the uhm uh that there are ethical and
moral grounds uh for Britain to continue to take an interest in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#47:1:B>
I mean surely like with the question from Miss Emily Lau the
honourable way is to ensure that these people do not have to in any way doubt
that they have a nationality after nineteen ninety-seven <O>
speech-by-Foreign-Secretary </O>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X48:1:Z>
Miss Loh </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-051#49:1:B>
Yes uh Foreign Secretary you  ' re a distinguished lawyer

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#50:1:B>
Uhm I  ' m sure you know that there is a vast world of difference
between having the right of abode somewhere and full citizenship

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#51:1:B>
So do you acknowledge that the ethnic minorities will not have full
citizenship

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#52:1:B>
And if not why do you want to make them wait till after nineteen
ninety-seven to see if there is a problem in order to solve really what is
now a very minor problem in human terms <O> several-speeches</O>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-051#53:1:B>
Uh Foreign Secretary I  ' m glad to have so many times that I
can address you today

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#54:1:B>
Uh you did say today at uh I believe uh a luncheon to the British
Chamber of Commerce that a successful transition means much more than a
smooth transition

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#55:1:B>
And that you said the objective of a successful transition is
served by Britain  ' s unwavering determination to do whatever we believe to be
in the best interest of Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#56:1:B>
And then rightly you go on to mention that you felt that there  ' s
no reason for this particular legislature to be liquidated after nineteen
ninety-seven

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#57:1:B>
Uh I think this council was uh quite disappointed with you when <?>
Qian Qichen </?> was in London uh where he made some comments about the
possibility of uh again liquidating this council

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#58:1:B>
But you seem to have just stood by and not respond

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#59:1:B>
But in any case you do have a chance now to go to China

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#60:1:B>
How are you going to demonstrate this unwavering determination

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#61:1:B>
What we don't want is for you to go to China and then if it is
inconvenient to bring this subject up then you don't bring it up

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#62:1:B>
How do you think you can represent as you said you said you would
go to China and you would communicate and to represent the views of Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#63:1:B>
And I think the views of Hong Kong is that we do not want to see
this legislature replaced by an appointed provisional body <O>
speech-by-Foreign-Secretary </O>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X64:1:Z>
Follow up </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-051#65:1:B>
Uh yes Foreign Secretary the point was clarified in London but
the opportunity I think was missed

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#66:1:B>
But this unwavering determination I mean what can the British
government do <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#67:1:B>
Is there anything that the British Government can do

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#68:1:B>
Or are you just going to stand by in nineteen ninety-seven and see
us liquidated <O> several-speeches </O>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X69:1:Z>
Mr Martin Lee </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-051#70:1:C>
Mr Foreign Secretary I had to leave uh early from the opening
of the Legal Year this afternoon in order to ask a question of you <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#71:1:C>
So lawyer to lawyer or QC to QC <,,> can I ask you what you would
actually do <,,> to using your own words at lunch ensure that Hong Kong
people  ' s fundamental rights and freedoms are properly safeguarded <,> if <,>
your counterparts in China were not to listen to your eloquent entreaty in
relation to the scrapping of this Legco and to be then to replace it with an
appointed provisional one and the emasculation of the Bills of Right
Ordinance <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#72:1:C>
Now just confining to these two important matters what will your
government actually do <,> not say no matter how eloquently you may say it
<{> <[> if they </[> if they were to refuse to listen

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X73:1:Z>
<[> Well </[> </{> </X> <O> speech-by-Foreign-Secretary </O>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X74:1:Z>
Mr <{> <[> Martin Lee </[> </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-051#75:1:C>
<[> Follow up if I may </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#76:1:C>
Now if they were really to go ahead and scrap this Legco and
replace it with an appointed one that is clear breach of the Joint
Declaration which is a joint uh which is an international agreement

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#77:1:C>
Surely there is something your government can do by taking the
other party to the World Court for example

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#78:1:C>
Has it ever occur to you

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#79:1:C>
And you don't have to sit back and lament over <{> <[> us </[> or
even pray for us

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X80:1:Z>
<[> Uh </[> </{> </X> <O> speech-by-Foreign-Secretary </O>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X81:1:Z>
Mr Howard Young </X>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-051#82:1:D>
Secretary I  ' m I  ' m interested to know to what extent the
United Kingdom Government will advise the Hong Kong Government and encourage
the Hong Kong Government to in respect to cooperation with the Preparatory
Committee which is about to be set up

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#83:1:D>
Uh looking back uh about two years ago when the Preparatory Working
Committee uh was set up it appears to us in Hong Kong that it started off
firstly with a stand of non-recognition non-cooperation and non-meeting

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#84:1:D>
And then at the behest of many in the community it it developed
into actual contact and briefings uh but short of full cooperation

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#85:1:D>
Of course the Governor has made quite clear that the Preparatory
Committee is within the terms of the Basic Law and the Joint Declaration and
therefore there will be cooperation and will be a liaison committee set up

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#86:1:D>
Uhm but uh liaison committee could mean very simple thing of just
passing <.> s </.> messages back and forth or it could mean something more
than that pointing to full-fledged uh cooperation

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#87:1:D>
I I  ' d like to know to what extent this cooperation is to be
fulfilled and implemented <O> speech-by-Foreign-Secretary </O>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X88:1:Z>
<{> <[> Howard </[> </X>

<$D> <[> I  ' d </[> </{> I  ' d to uh <.> sub </.> add that I speak also as a
member about to receive appointment under the <.> Pre </.> Preparatory
Committee

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#89:1:D>
Uh does Secretary <.> real </.> recognise that uh because of the
fears of Hong Kong <,> people that there might uh be created a second power
centre which could theoretically undermine the uh the effect of the Hong Kong
Government

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#90:1:D>
And despite that the Chinese Government in <?> this </?> Director
Lu Ping statement that it would not second power centre that if the
Preparatory Committee feels that it  ' s not getting sufficient cooperation and
then tries to go on its own to set up a huge secretariat then that is
probably what would transpire

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#91:1:D>
So therefore does Secretary agree that the in fact the more
resources and manpower that Hong Kong Government is able to put in to help
the Preparatory Committee put in its work will in fact achieve the result of
having uh less need for the Preparatory Committee to go out and do its own
show which I I think nobody including people who are on the Preparatory
Committee want to do <O> speech-by-Foreign-Secretary </O>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X92:1:Z>
Mrs Elizabeth Wong </X>

<$E> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-051#93:1:E>
Mr Chairman uhm Mr Foreign Secretary uhm I seek to ask a
question which is neither interesting nor provocative nor hypothetical but
actually factual <,> and relevant to the fundamental well-being of Hong Kong
and smooth transition of sovereign powers

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#94:1:E>
Now just to remind us of two testaments

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#95:1:E>
This is Sino-British Joint Declaration

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#96:1:E>
This is the Basic Law <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#97:1:E>
Under section three two of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and
section two of the Basic Law <,> both the British Government and the Chinese
Government have promised us Hong Kong people a high degree of autonomy <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#98:1:E>
Yet nowhere even in your beautiful introductory remark <,> has the
phrase <mention> high degree of autonomy </mention> crept in

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#99:1:E>
Indeed up to now there is very little evidence which is conspicuous
regarding the attention we are paying to this attainment of high degree of
autonomy <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#100:1:E>
So my question is a very factual one <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#101:1:E>
It is whether you regard this as it is your duty and your business
to ensure that there is this high degree of autonomy

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#102:1:E>
And if so what exactly are you doing about it <O>
speech-by-Foreign-Secretary </O>

<$E> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-051#103:1:E>
Uh Sir uh I don't think you have quite answered my <{> <[>
question

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#104:1:E>
My </[> question is what are the factual evidences <,> of the
pursuit of high degree of autonomy

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#105:1:E>
Everything we see does not point to the high degree of autonomy

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#106:1:E>
I mean you know there are sort gives and takes and uh compromises
here and there and everywhere including the point just raised before
regarding uhm the Provisional Legislature

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#107:1:E>
People are threatening to dismantle this legislature

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#108:1:E>
I know you have said uh that you disapprove of that

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#109:1:E>
And yet there is no evidence something is done about it and what
indeed can be done about

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#110:1:E>
And uh you know there is a whole series of things

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#111:1:E>
I see no evidence <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#112:1:E>
And not only I

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#113:1:E>
Many people agree with me that is no evidence that we will be in
fact <,> guaranteed the high degree of autonomy

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#114:1:E>
It looks pretty on paper

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#115:1:E>
It is too beautiful <,,> to be trusted in fact

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#116:1:E>
So what I  ' m saying is that what are the factual bits of evidence
that we can get that we will be in fact uh getting it

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X117:1:Z>
<[> I  ' m sorry </[> </{> </X> <O> several-speeches </O>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X118:1:Z>
I will allow two more questions on that

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X119:1:Z>
Ms Emily Lau </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-051#120:1:A>
Uh thank you Chairman

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#121:1:A>
Chairman I want to ask the Foreign Secretary about uh a question
on uh violations of human rights after nineteen ninety-seven

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#122:1:A>
I hope he appreciates that is one of the you know biggest fears of
Hong Kong people that the Chinese Government should want to come and settle
accounts with its enemies

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#123:1:A>
Maybe there are quite a number in this council

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#124:1:A>
And that  ' s why we  ' re all going to be thrown out

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#125:1:A>
So I think there is real concern

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#126:1:A>
And even amongst journalists

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#127:1:A>
They are worried

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#128:1:A>
And that  ' s why they practice self-censorship

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#129:1:A>
So after ninety-seven if people should be <.> cu </.> persecuted
by the SAR Government or by the Chinese Government directly and some may want
to seek refuge abroad

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#130:1:A>
Some may want to stay here and go to prison and be martyrs but
some may want shelter

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#131:1:A>
What is what do you think is your government  ' s obligation
regarding helping these people <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#132:1:A>
Do you have a special obligation or will you be just another
member of the international community who may pay lip service to it and and
do nothing <O> speech-by-Foreign-Secretary </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-051#133:1:A>
Chairman I did ask the Foreign Secretary about offering
refuge

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#134:1:A>
I mean that is if they can get out <?> and </?> if they  ' re locked
up already then uh then I hope you will do what you can to seek their early
release like the release of Wei Jiang Shen <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#135:1:A>
But for those who <.> c </.> may of a chance of fleeing do you
think Britain or can you say right now in nineteen ninety-six and say yes
Britain is prepared to take all these political or whatever other refugees
who may be fleeing the Hong Kong SAR <O> speech-by-Foreign-Secretary </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-051#136:1:A>
So Chairman the <.> Fo </.> Foreign Secretary  ' s saying he
can't give us a categoric assurance

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X137:1:Z>
Miss Lau you know perfectly well

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X138:1:Z>
You  ' ve been in politics long enough

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X139:1:Z>
You know perfectly well <{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X140:1:Z>
You know you know perfectly well that foreign secretaries cannot
give a categoric assurances about hypothetical individual cases of political
asylum

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X141:1:Z>
And you  ' d be astonished if I was able to give any different
answer to that questions

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X142:1:Z>
And please don't misrepresent what you know is the only answer
that can be given in the kind of circumstances that we  ' re discussing </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-051#143:1:A>
<[> Not as long as you </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X144:1:Z>
We hope you  ' ll be a slightly different kind of foreign secretary
</X> <O> laughter </O>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X145:1:Z>
Martin Lee </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-051#146:1:C>
Yes uh Foreign Secretary

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#147:1:C>
You you talk about the cabinet uh soon addressing this point

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#148:1:C>
I I can uh make a wager with you

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#149:1:C>
Five hundred pounds to your fifty pounds that the cabinet will say
no

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#150:1:C>
Uhm and uh see what what <?> it  ' s meant </?> is that uh this is
another proposal coming from our Governor when he last visited United Kingdom

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#151:1:C>
He made another uh took up another matter that is a three and a
half million passports for our uh the people born in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#152:1:C>
And apart from admiring him for his courage and clarity of <?> his
</?> vision are you going to actually back him up or you going to ignore him
just as it is being ignored up in Beijing <O> speech-by-Foreign-Secretary
</O>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-051#153:1:C>
Why why didn't you back up the Governor by accepting my wager

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X154:1:Z>
Time will tell

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X155:1:Z>
Time will tell

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X156:1:Z>
<{> <[> Maybe </[> and then we might have a further conversation

<$Z> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-051#157:1:Z>
<[> Well Foreign Secretary </[> </{>

<$Z> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-051#158:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X159:1:Z>
Foreign Secretary usually don't <unc> one-word </unc>
chances

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X160:1:Z>
Can we uh move on to a lingering problem on Vietnamese boatpeople
with a few minutes left

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#X161:1:Z>
Uh Mr Allen Lee </X>

<$F> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-051#162:1:F>
Uh Foreign Secretary before uh I ask you a question on
boatpeople I just hope uh and I  ' m sure members of this council would uh
would join me uh on the way as you say time will time

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#163:1:F>
I  ' d like to invite you back to this uh council in Hong Kong
January next year

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#164:1:F>
Perhaps you will answer not so hypothetical question is about
Provisional Legco

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#165:1:F>
And uh certainly I hope uh your party stay in power and uh you
continue to be the Foreign Secretary so you could <.> ans </.> answer those
questions directly

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#166:1:F>
Uh by then I  ' m sure will be not so hypothetical questions

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#167:1:F>
Uh my my question with regard to the Vietnamese boatpeople

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#168:1:F>
This is a long standing uh problem that Hong Kong uh has
shouldered

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#169:1:F>
And there is a British undertaking by resolve this boatpeople
problem uh by nineteen ninety-seven

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#170:1:F>
Uh perhaps repatriation

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#171:1:F>
But so far still there are twenty thousand boatpeople left in Hong
Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#172:1:F>
And no visible solutions

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#173:1:F>
Only this morning we saw the newspaper reporting there will be a
meeting in Bangkok uh <.> mid </.> middle of this month

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#174:1:F>
Now what is the British responsibility towards these boatpeople if
if even though you said may be hypothetical and might be become visible that
if they are left over in Hong Kong by nineteen ninety-seven

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#175:1:F>
Now could you say that there will be no boatpeople leftover uhm in
Hong Kong as a statement uh to the people of Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-051#176:1:F>
I  ' m sure we will welcome that </I>
