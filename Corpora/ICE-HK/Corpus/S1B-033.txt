Good evening and welcome to this New Year eve edition of Newsline

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X2:1:Z>
What is the state of Hong Kong  ' s political parties on the eve of
the twentieth first century

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X3:1:Z>
To what extent were they work with each other

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X4:1:Z>
And are they still united on the issue of full democracy

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X5:1:Z>
To discuss these issues we have with us today the chairmen of the
three biggest political parties in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X6:1:Z>
Martin Lee of the Democratic Party Tsang Yuk Sing of the Democratic
Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong and James Tien of the Liberal Party

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X7:1:Z>
Welcome gentlemen and thanks for taking kind <unc> one-word
</unc> during a holiday period comes on to the programme

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X8:1:Z>
Martin if I may start of you

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X9:1:Z>
Uh what kind of shape is your party you lost uh like hundred and
seventy thousand votes in the last election </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#10:1:A>
Yeah we are still uh waiting for uhm <,> an opportunity to do
a very shorter review and we are busily doing that

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#11:1:A>
And until that time I  ' m afraid that we can only talk about reform

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#12:1:A>
I certainly want to uh do a quite lot about the party we we know
quite a lot of uh difficulties but how to overcome them is then of course is
the next problem

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X13:1:Z>
But uhm you  ' re pretty confidence that you can overcome these <{>
<[> problems </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#14:1:A>
<[> Oh </[> </{> yes including <,> uh certainly uh uniting the
party again because that important <{> <[> it uh </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X15:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X16:1:Z>
And Tsang Yuk Sing uh your party has some serious problem also

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X17:1:Z>
Your Vice- Chairman was forced to resign uh and uh uh you you lost
the uh <?> recent </?> by election uh on Hong Kong Island </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#18:1:B>
Right

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X19:1:Z>
Uh what kind of shape overall <{> <[> <unc> one-word
</unc> </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#20:1:B>
<[> But we </[> </{> we are still uh assessing the uh damage
caused by uh <,> uh Gary Cheng  ' s scandal

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#21:1:B>
Oh uh she said we lost Vice-Chairman we lost uh various safe seat
uh on Hong Kong Island

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#22:1:B>
We are still looking for <,> uh replacement uh uh for substitute uh
to uhm take up the uh vacant post left left over by uh Mr Cheng

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#23:1:B>
Uh <,> so I <{> <[> mean </[> that  ' s it

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X24:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X25:1:Z>
Uh ha so so <{> <[> you <unc> one-word </unc> </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#26:1:A>
<[> You also has a </[> </{> <unc> one-words </unc>
our wound

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#27:1:B>
And Martin Martin said before the <.> Septem </.> election
that the DAB will set to become the largest party in the uh <,> in the Legco

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X28:1:Z>
Uh ha and that hasn't happened <{> <[> <,> </[> is that

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X29:1:Z>
But you  ' ve are you confidence that will happen </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#30:1:B>
<[> Right </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#31:1:B>
Well <,,> we <,> our aim now is to become a large party

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#32:1:B>
I mean <,> to be largest doesn't really make uh uh uh very much uh
meaning <{1> <[1> uh </[1> <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#33:1:B>
But uhm you know <,> we we have to do a lot we are still a a far
way from being uh really uh decent political <{3> <[3> party </[3>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X34:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#35:1:A>
<[2> I agree </[2> </{2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X36:1:Z>
<[3> Uh ha </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X37:1:Z>
Well James what about the Liberal I mean uh you have fewer members
now than you did <{> <[> uh previously </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X38:1:Z>
And in the uh <?> recent </?> election you you had nobody won in
the direct elections

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X39:1:Z>
Uh what kind of shape are you in

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X40:1:Z>
What what do you think the future hold </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#41:1:C>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#42:1:C>
Uh although we only lost one seat on the functional constituency
side

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#43:1:C>
We have uhm eight <,> uh instead of nine from last section <{1>
<[1> <,> </[1> but uh again like you said we still looking for the
breakthrough on the direct election side

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#44:1:C>
<{2> <[2> The </[2> candidates uh we try to fill are not our top
<unc> one-word </unc> uh legislators with past experience

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#45:1:C>
<{3> <[3> Uh </[3> so most of the new comers are second <?> layer
</?> then do that well

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#46:1:C>
Although one or two were quite encouraging we did get <,> uh more
votes than uh last time

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#47:1:C>
<{4> <[4> But again </[4> like I said we  ' re still uh not happy
with the result

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#48:1:C>
We would want to see <,> uh having a breakthrough by actually
winning one seat

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#49:1:C>
So our strategy now maybe for year two O O four was not again to
spread <?> ourself </?> through <?> fit </?> <{5> <[5> <,> </[5> with our
second <?> layers </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#50:1:C>
And may be we should come over someone to just simply put all our
effort to win one seat in one of the five territories in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#51:1:C>
<{6> <[6> But what </[6> is more <,> is mean uhm what uh uh uh what  ' s
supporting for me is that our district work uh we seem to be a little bit at
loss about how to <?> rule </?> we used to be tried to <?> work </?> a DAB or
DP

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#52:1:C>
<{7> <[7> Like </[7> what are they doing successfully

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#53:1:C>
So we try to do what they were doing successfully to get some
success uh for our candidates

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#54:1:C>
But it seems that their past uh uh success story uh is also failing
like Lee Wing Tat

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#55:1:C>
So may be we will have to uh do little better to see <{8> <[8> what
</[8> are the areas that able successful <{9> <[9> at </[9> and try to do
what they <?> are you </?> or shall we come <?> overs </?> our way <{10>
<[10> of trying </[10> to do more uh <{11> <[11> district work </[11> or
<{12> <[12> grassroots work </[12>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X56:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X57:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X58:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X59:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X60:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X61:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X62:1:Z>
<[7> Uhm </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X63:1:Z>
<[8> Uhm </[8> </{8>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X64:1:Z>
<[9> Uhm uhm </[9> </{9>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X65:1:Z>
<[10> Uhm </[10> </{10>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X66:1:Z>
<[11> Right </[11> </{11> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#67:1:B>
<[12> Will you use to be </[12> </{12> more authoritative than
than Martin and I on district work is use <,> uh uh now uh the the member of
the District Council who we are not

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#68:1:C>
That  ' s my first <{1> </[1> experience personally </[1> but
that  ' s actually uh easier <{2> <[2> just </[2> when I represent the Peak or
the Central Western District Board and these the problem uh to to those
residents are more confine to the local community

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#69:1:C>
They are not really interested in the big issue we <{3> <[3> we
</[3> talk about at least uh in my <{4> <[4> constituency </[4>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X70:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X71:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X72:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X73:1:Z>
<[4> Right </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X74:1:Z>
So uh you are determined to uh run at first someone in your party
to run into right elections next time <{> <[> uh </[> </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#75:1:C>
<[> Was </[> </{> was a test or actually concentrating in one
area like should <unc> one-word </unc> should

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#76:1:C>
Should it be like Hong Kong Island <{1> <[1> or should </[1> it be
New <?> Territory </?> <{2> <[2> East or </[2> West instead of trying to fill
three or four candidate across the whole <{3> <[3> territory </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#77:1:C>
And the point whether we should come out was one of our existing
legislators <{4> <[4> is something </[4> we seriously considering now for two
<{5> <[5> O O </[5>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X78:1:Z>
<[1> I see </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X79:1:Z>
<[2> Uh ha </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X80:1:Z>
<[3> Right </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X81:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4> </X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#82:1:Z>
<[5> Right </[5>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#83:1:A>
<[5> Uh James you </[5> </{5> you surly that  ' s a wrong
question

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#84:1:A>
Uh who should come out where

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#85:1:A>
The question is <,> uhm <,> we I think I was <?> suggesting </?>
you that you guys must all come out <,> uh in every constituency there are
only five large one

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#86:1:A>
Uh that  ' s the way to go forward and not to sit back and count on
the functional constituency seats still remaining <{> <[> but come out sooner
and later </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#87:1:C>
<[> But Martin you in each </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#88:1:C>
If you suggest that to me you still have three of the functional
constituent seats like <{1> <[1> <unc> one word </unc> Cheung Man
Kwong I think we </[1> should have gone for direct <{2> <[2> election </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#89:1:C>
Why he  ' s still contesting <{3> <[3> the education seat </[3>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#90:1:A>
<[1> Oh yeah oh yes we </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#91:1:A>
<[2> Oh yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#92:1:A>
<[3> But we we are </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#93:1:A>
We are doing our best

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#94:1:C>
<unc> several words </unc> he <{1> <[1> he  ' s more
directly <?> electable </?> </[1> that a <{2> <[2> lot of us </[2>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#95:1:A>
<[1> Oh yeah <.> absou </.> </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#96:1:A>
<[2> Yes </[2> </{2> but we have definitely uh pushing for the
evolution of all these functional constituency seat <{1> <[1> as </[1> soon
as <{2> <[2> possible </[2>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#97:1:C>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#98:1:C>
<[2> Yeah </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X99:1:Z>
<[2> Right </[2> </{2> okay uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X100:1:Z>
Now the three parties together your your three parties together
uh and up to thirty seat in uh Legco right

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X101:1:Z>
Uh so that  ' s actually majority since the president doesn't vote

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X102:1:Z>
And if you the three of uh if you can cooperate on issues uh you
can you can get a lot of things uh <{> <[> <unc> one-word </unc> </[>
</X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#103:1:C>
<[> We can </[> </{> certainly block a lot of things we can
block <{> <[> everything </[> particularly

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X104:1:Z>
<[> Uh ha </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X105:1:Z>
But what do you think of the idea of of having a coalition of
your three parties in the legislature uh <,> uh Tsang Yuk Sing </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#106:1:B>
Well <,> in in in the first place we we three <unc>
one-word </unc> <{1> <[1> parties alright in <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#107:1:B>
I I I don't rule out the possibility of uh cooperating <{2> <[2>
<,> </[2> on specific issue <?> certainly </?> we have done so <{3> <[3> uh
in </[3> the past <,> uhm on on on various occasions

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#108:1:B>
But uhm uhm <,> if you  ' re talking of uh a consistent long
standing uh <{4> <[4> coalition </[4> then I don't think uh <,> uh the the
the uhm up till now uh the the basic beliefs <{5> <[5> the uhm </[5> <.> es
</.> especially our political uh stance <{6> <[6> <,> </[6> of of each our
each each the three each of the three parties uh would make that possible

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X109:1:Z>
<[1> Uh ha coalition is not possible </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X110:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X111:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X112:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X113:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm um </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X114:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X115:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#116:1:A>
But surely the problem is that we don't <,> uh I mean we
stuck together alright and at the last debate on of the last term <{1> <[1>
<,> </[1> uh on the motion of no confidence of the Director of Housing
alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#117:1:A>
And immediately after that because we were then resolved the Chief
Executive then said well <,> uh the Director of Housing has been doing a fine
job he remains

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#118:1:A>
<{2> <[2> So when </[2> we resume we try to do something about
that and we lost immediately the support of the <,> two other parties

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#119:1:A>
Uh that  ' s the time when we should have <,> remain together <{3>
<[3> now </[3> to push it through

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X120:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X121:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X122:1:Z>
<[3> Uh </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X123:1:Z>
No no too <?> unfair </?> Martin

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X124:1:Z>
When <,> because it was Fred Li from your party who uh <{1> <[1>
vote that </[1> motion right <{2> <[2> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X125:1:Z>
Not </[2> yes

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X126:1:Z>
But when Fred ask for our support when he was lobbying uh among
other colleagues in the uh in the Legco

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X127:1:Z>
He made it a point that he was not asking for the <?> resignation
</?> of anyone

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X128:1:Z>
He said this is only <,> a motion that tells the public we have
no confidence in these two <,> uh people

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X129:1:Z>
We are not asking for the removal or resignation of anybody no

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X130:1:Z>
That was what Fred Li clearly said in in his speech <{3> <[3>
<unc> one-word </unc> </[3> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#131:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#132:1:A>
<[2> And you support it </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#133:1:A>
<[3> How </[3> </{3> can we tolerate the same man <,> occupying
exactly the same post in dealing with us

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#134:1:A>
When we together <{> <[> pass the motion <unc> several words
</unc> post </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#135:1:B>
<[> But Martin I think <unc> two-words </unc> this
relevant right now </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#136:1:B>
We passed the motion with the cooperation of the three parties but
still government the executive lead government is not doing anything about it

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#137:1:B>
But on the other hand we still <.> sh </.> we should still try to
cooperate more often

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#138:1:B>
But I think in this issue between the three party DAB is probably
<,> in the best position

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#139:1:B>
Because politically probably the Liberals and DAB see eye to eye

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#140:1:B>
But a lot of grassroots issue DP and DAB see things eye to eye

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#141:1:B>
And you think that we  ' re always supporting government look at the
government fees and charges on businesses

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#142:1:B>
We  ' re the one who  ' s raising objection to government raising fees
and charges but DP who  ' s always saying they  ' re against government in this
particular incident they  ' re supporting government <{1> <[1> to raise fee and
charges on </[1> on on <{2> <[2> small <unc> several-words </unc>
</[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X143:1:Z>
<[1> But do do you think </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X144:1:Z>
<[2> Do you think the right now there </[2> </{2> is no
government party in the legislature

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X145:1:Z>
Do you think the government need <unc> one-word </unc> of
a party in the <{> <[> legislature </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#146:1:A>
<[> Well it </[> </{> should <.> gov </.> government has the
party on on crucial things then they can count up to thirty nine legislators
<{> <[> uh well </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#147:1:C>
<[> They are not </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#148:1:C>
They they don't <{> <[> want to right now so because </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X149:1:Z>
<[> Your your <,> your <unc> one-word </unc> </[> </{>
DAB as the government party </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#150:1:A>
Well and and the other I mean <{1> <[1> you have </[1> this
<,> the democratic camp <{2> <[2> uh </[2> small letter D

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#151:1:A>
I know we have about twenty one

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#152:1:A>
I mean look at the crucial vote for example the most recent one
was the one <,> on the uh public order ordinance <{3> <[3> section </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#153:1:A>
And the well the uh most speakers who spoke I remember very
clearly uh found that the there were something wrong with it you know <{5>
<[5> and and yet some people </[5>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X154:1:Z>
<[1> Uh ha </[1> </{1>

<[> Well </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#161:1:B>
Well uh Martin Martin  ' s speaking as if <,> uh what he  ' s calls
the democratic camp must be in your position

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#162:1:B>
That is <{1> <[1> DPD </[1> democratic camp would always vote
against the government <{2> <[2> whereas the </[2> others always vote for the
government

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#163:1:B>
<{3> <[3> don't I don't see </[3> necessity in that

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#164:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#165:1:A>
<[2> Yeah <unc> two-words </unc> </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#166:1:A>
<[3> Uh I  ' m I  ' m sorry </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#167:1:A>
<{1> <[1> Well </[1> I  ' m I  ' m sorry I I <{2> <[2> <.> sup </.>
</[2> crucial matters the government can always count on the thirty nine

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X168:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#169:1:B>
<[2> Okay </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#170:1:B>
<{> <[> What </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X171:1:Z>
<[> Is </[> </{> is it true on crucial <{> <[> matters <unc>
one-word </unc> govern our counts on you </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#172:1:B>
<[> No I mean <,> it </[> </{> depends it depends on what do
you mean what you mean by crucial

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#173:1:C>
It  ' s crucial to <{1> <[1> Martin </[1> but not to <{2> <[2>
us </[2>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#174:1:B>
<[1> Well </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#175:1:B>
<[2> <?> You </?> </[2> </{2> right

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#176:1:B>
I mean

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#177:1:A>
Human rights <{> <[> to me </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#178:1:B>
<[> No sometimes </[> </{> <{1> <[1> uh what </[1> I can say
is this perhaps <,> well more often than not the government <,> would think
that it is easier to <?> lock </?> people support uhm <,> uhm among the DAB
members or it <{2> <[2> perhaps </[2> among the Liberal Party members <{3>
<[3> and among </[3> uh Martin party

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#179:1:B>
So the government may reason this way now if this motion uhm is
not supported even by the DAB or even by the Democratic Party uh by the uh
<{4> <[4> Liberal Party </[4> then we may as well we thought <,> alright it
may be their logic <{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#180:1:B>
So <{6> <[6> I </[6>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X181:1:Z>
<[1> Uh uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X182:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X183:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X184:1:Z>
<[4> <unc> one-word </unc> uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X185:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm uhm </[5> </{5> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#186:1:A>
<[6> Why </[6> </{6> don't you let <?> people </?> withdraw
it and you said there  ' s no <{> <[> necessities </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#187:1:B>
<[> Well and and </[> </{> and they did

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#188:1:B>
I mean uh there there were examples when the government really
show there was no chance of <,> you know its motion getting through

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#189:1:B>
So they so they <{> <[> <unc> one-word </unc> </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#190:1:C>
<[> Or </[> </{> that motion to be fair uh the public or the
audience uh a lot of business and professional spoke out to say that there is
a need <,> for the ordinance and eventually Democratic Party agree too

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#191:1:C>
It  ' s just on the detail whether you need a seven day <{1> <[1>
voters </[1> and the thirty person requiring <{2> <[2> a <unc> one-word
</unc> </[2>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#192:1:B>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#193:1:A>
<[2> And then you should </[2> </{2> you should be supporting
me because the wording of the motion is very specific

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#194:1:A>
If you support the motion at all that means the government can
keep the whole <{> <[> theme </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#195:1:C>
<[> But </[> </{> look at your amend and your amendment is
worse

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#196:1:A>
No no but but even after <{> <[> I I </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#197:1:C>
<[> Are you suggesting </[> </{> we should vote <{1> <[1>
against amendment </[1> and your original <{2> <[2> motion </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X198:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#199:1:A>
<[1> I  ' m sorry </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#200:1:A>
<[2> Even </[2> </{2> after amendments failed you should have <,>
you should have <?> refuse </?> to support your original motion move by the
government to make sure that the government will have to go back and put the
thinking cap point and work with other people to improve the law

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#201:1:A>
<{> <[> Surely that is </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#202:1:C>
<[> But <.> secu </.> the </[> </{> security said the I
putting in the thinking <unc> one-word </unc> and look <{> <[> into
</[> that issue

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#203:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X204:1:Z>
I  ' m I  ' m sorry uh we have to take a break now

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X205:1:Z>
Don't go away we  ' ll be right back <&> Commercial beak </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X206:1:Z>
Welcome back we  ' re talking to the chairmen of the three biggest
political parties in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X207:1:Z>
Uh James we  ' re talking cooperation among the various parties

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X208:1:Z>
Do you think that <,> your three parties can cooperate more </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#209:1:C>
Certainly

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#210:1:C>
Now although Martin likes there are certain motions that has been
passing uh past but the government still <,> does not take it seriously

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#211:1:C>
But that at least better to the general for the as far the general
public is <{1> <[1> concern </[1> that there are certain things that the
three of us agree

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#212:1:C>
<{2> <[2> A lot </[2> of our motion debate now you could see that
if the Liberal Party raises <,> uh uh propose a motion we never talk to the
<,> to DP or DAB

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#213:1:C>
And then they would put <{3> <[3> uh </[3> an amendment just may
be doesn't like part of the things <{4  <[4> that we </[4> proposed <{5> <[5>
and </[5> they do the same thing uh when <{6> <[6> they were </[6> proposing
<{7> <[7> <unc> one-word </unc> </[7>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X214:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X215:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X216:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X217:1:Z>
<[4> I see </[4> </{4> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#218:1:B>
<[5> So </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#219:1:B>
<[6> So uh </[6> </{6>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X220:1:Z>
<[7> Why </[7> </{7> don't you talk to each other <{> <[> I mean
</[> </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#221:1:C>
<[> Well that  ' s </[> </{> why I  ' m suggesting that <{1> <[1>
<,> </[1> may be in future <{2> <[2> uh we should we should do uh </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X222:1:Z>
<[1> Uh ha </[1> </{1> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#223:1:B>
<[2> But uh </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X224:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah uh Tsang Yuk Sing do you </[2> </{2> think you could do
that </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#225:1:B>
On on the

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#226:1:B>
Yes definitely on the on the one hand <?> only </?> <,> all want
to see things done

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#227:1:B>
You  ' re all want to get things done alright and and and of course
we understand that uh if we cooperate then it will be much easier for us to
do things <{1> <[1> can things </[1> moving

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#228:1:B>
But on the other hand I think <,> it is it is reality that uhm <,>
we become rivals during <,> elections <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#229:1:B>
And now if <{3> <[3> and we <?> achievement </?> if if if no

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#230:1:B>
Well well </[3> you have a point that <{4> <[4> <,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#231:1:B>
What I  ' m saying is if every achievement of the Legco uh is
equally creditable to all the different <{5> <[5> parties </[5> then then how
do we stand out uh I mean apart from the others

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#232:1:B>
I mean this is the kind of mentality that that <,> often <{6> <[6>
drives </[6> members of different parties to <{7> <[7> you know to take
independent commission </[7>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X233:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X234:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X235:1:Z>
<[3> But in <unc> one-word </unc> election all <?> yes
</?> way uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X236:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X237:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X238:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X239:1:Z>
<[7> Right but in in the </[7> </{7> main function of Legco is to
act as a check on the administration

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X240:1:Z>
And if uh you all go in your own ways and you cannot act
effectively as a check <{1> <[1> <unc> two-words </unc> working </[1>
together then you can check <{2> <[2> the government </[2> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#241:1:B>
<[1> Yeah so <unc> one-word </unc> </[1> </{1>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#242:1:C>
<[2> Yeah for example </[2> </{2> or air <{1> <[1> pollution
</[1> we are all concern about air pollution

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#243:1:C>
So we all come up with our ten details fine point

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#244:1:C>
<{2> <[2> But if </[2> just when issue whether the fine should be
one thousand dollar or I proposed two thousand

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#245:1:C>
<{3> <[3> And </[3> someone think two thousand is too much

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#246:1:C>
I  ' m sure we should talk about <{4> <[4> it and uh </[4> we are
some so that that the whole <{5> <[5> uh </[5> motion will get pass instead
of I <?> voting your </?> against it and they <?> voting </?> uh against on
<{6> <[6> our vote </[6>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#247:1:B>
<[1> Yeah right </[1> </{1>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X248:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X249:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#250:1:B>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X251:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X252:1:Z>
<[5> Yeah </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X253:1:Z>
<[6> Now </[6> </{6> <{> <[> Martin the </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#254:1:A>
<[> Your on </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#255:1:A>
On pollution matters that are really happening

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#256:1:A>
And in fact uh we <unc> one- word </unc> doing that even
during the last ten of <{> <[> <?> office </?> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#257:1:A>
Now but I I I certainly uh an great supporter this idea because if
you can agree on important policy issues we are effectively a coalition

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X258:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X259:1:Z>
Right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#260:1:A>
Alright <{> <[> and </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#261:1:C>
<[> But </[> </{> it  ' s probably <{> <[> in the sense </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X262:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#263:1:A>
<[> Uh uh </[> </{> yes and we can

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#264:1:A>
Now but <,> the the important premise is we must be prepared to
stick together <{1> <[1> on the uh </[1> things we have agreed on and use the
only weapon we have <,> which is well <,> the most powerful and which is to
vote down the <{2> <[2> budget </[2> if the government doesn't <{3> <[3> face
<unc> one-word </unc> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#265:1:A>
Now are they all prepared to do that

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X266:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X267:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-033#X268:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3> </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-033#269:1:C>
Well I don't think you may you  ' re prepared to do that </I>
