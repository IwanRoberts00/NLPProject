<h> <bold> Reform prescribed for health-hub plan </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#4:1>

<p> <bold> IN A RECENT </bold> speech to leading doctors , Financial
Secretary Antony Leung Kam-chung revealed the Government  ' s mission to turn
Hong Kong into a health-care services hub for Asia . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#5:1>

<p> The ambitious plan would involve the SAR  ' s leading private doctors using
their specialist skills to attract wealthy patients from overseas , much as
the US does . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#6:1>

<p> But the proposal , backed by Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa and Secretary
for Health and Welfare Dr Yeoh Eng-kiong , has met a lukewarm response from
doctors in the private sector . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#7:1>


<p> While private doctors support the idea in principle , many say the
Government is putting the cart before the horse .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#8:1>
Before Hong Kong can become Asia  ' s doctor , they say , it needs to
get its private health-care sector into shape . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#9:1>

<p> Doctors agree with Mr Leung that the private sector can improve
efficiency and offer patients more choice .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#10:1>
But they argue that the imbalance between the private and the - much
larger - public sector must be tackled before the Government  ' s aims can be
achieved . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#11:1>

<p> Health care is big business .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#12:1>
Medical treatment is expensive and patients are willing to spend to
ensure good health .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#13:1>
Hong Kong  ' s health-care expenditure constitutes five per cent of
gross domestic product , or about &dollar;56 billion a year .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#14:1>
Of that , about 46 per cent , or at least &dollar;25 billion , is
spent in the private market . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#15:1>

<p> As Mr Leung pointed out , the United States has been very successful at
selling health-care services to patients around the world .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#16:1>
Those who can afford it shop for the most up-to-date treatment in the
US .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#17:1>
Some even travel there for routine check-ups . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#18:1>

<p> In Asia , Singapore is moving in the same direction , developing the
required specialist medical skills .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#19:1>
Singapore has sent doctors and nurses to many parts of the region to
set up clinics providing direct treatment .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#20:1>
&ldquo; Today , as it happens , Hong Kong is the largest exporter of
accounting services to the mainland .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#21:1>
In 10 years ' time , we could also be the largest exporter of
health-care services , &rdquo; Mr Leung said . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#22:1>

<p> But the president of the Medical Association , Dr Lo Wing-lok , said the
Government must reduce the size of the public health-care sector before the
private sector can flourish . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#23:1>

<p> Dr Lo , also the legislator representing the medical sector , said the
very cheap and good services provided by public clinics and hospitals meant
most patients were not willing to spend on private health care , making it
difficult for private doctors to invest in their services. </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#24:1>

<p> The SAR Government subsidises 98 per cent of health-care costs in public
hospitals . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#25:1>

<p> About 93 per cent of all hospital in-patients are treated by the public
sector .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#26:1>
Patients are paying only &dollar;68 a day for a hospital bed ,
including all consultation fees , drugs and food .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#27:1>
And the price is the same whether a patient is having a simple
operation or a liver transplant . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#28:1>

<p> A general out-patient consultation and a specialist consultation at
public clinics cost just &dollar;37 and &dollar;44 . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#29:1>

<p> According to a Medical Association survey in March last year , the
average fee for a visit to a private general practitioner is &dollar;170 ,
while specialists charge between &dollar;350 and &dollar;500 for a basic
consultation . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#30:1>

<p> With the number of patients rising , the Hospital Authority is facing a
budget deficit for the first time since it was set up in 1991 . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#31:1>

<p> The authority  ' s chief executive , Dr William Ho Shiu-wei , said recently
he projected a &dollar;225 million deficit this financial year .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#32:1>
Authority executives and officials are scratching their heads about
how to tackle the problem . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#33:1>

<p> The most likely solution , but also the one most resisted by the public ,
is a rise in charges . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#34:1>

<p> Dr Lo said it was not valid for Mr Leung to compare Singapore with Hong
Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#35:1>
Singapore has a medical savings scheme and a voluntary insurance
scheme , under which citizens save for their medical expenses . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#36:1>

<p> &ldquo; Singapore has a rather different model .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#37:1>
Citizens can use their own contribution in the medical-care account
in the private sector , so the private sector is very active and strong , and
it can further invest in equipment and skills to treat overseas patients ,
&rdquo; Dr Lo said . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#38:1>

<p> &ldquo; In Hong Kong , it is risky to invest millions of dollars on
advanced equipment because you may not know if there is a customer .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#39:1>
The private sector is so weak , many superstar doctors choose to stay
with public hospitals or universities . &rdquo; </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#40:1>

<p> Dr Lo believes Hong Kong should have a clear position on private health
care . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#41:1>

<p> &ldquo; Before we can turn it into a regional centre , we need to fix the
internal market .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#42:1>
And the Government should no longer see health care as welfare , but
an industry it wants to develop . &rdquo; </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#43:1>

<p> He said doctors also had to upgrade their skills to make private medical
services more attractive .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#44:1>
Better-off patients were always there to shop for quality services .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#45:1>

<p> For example , more and more doctors were learning how to treat mood
disorders - a product of the economic downturn - while others were expanding
into cosmetic surgery , and even ear-piercing . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#46:1>

<p> Dr Gabriel Choi Kin , president of the Practising Estate Doctors'
Association , is even more critical of the health-care hub idea , calling it
&ldquo; something proposed by laymen who do not know very much about our
profession" . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#47:1>

<p> &ldquo; The financial crisis means many patients in Malaysia , Indonesia
or Thailand are not seeking expensive treatment overseas .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#48:1>
Singapore also suffers from the decline in the number of wealthy
patients , &rdquo; Dr Choi said . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#49:1>

<p> The Government has also suggested that Hong Kong  ' s doctors should
&ldquo; export &rdquo; their services to the mainland . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#50:1>

<p> But Dr Choi said: &ldquo; Most Hong Kong doctors are not keen to practise
in the mainland .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#51:1>
There are a lot of restrictions in licensing for Hong Kong doctors
there . &rdquo; </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#52:1>

<p> Dr Walton Li Wai-tat , president of the Private Hospitals ' Association ,
said that with the large price differences between public and private
hospitals , private hospitals could never compete on a level playing field .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#53:1>

<p> &ldquo; The Hospital Authority should list the priority of services it
provides so patients will not have unrealistic expectations , &rdquo; Dr Li
said . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#54:1>

<p> &ldquo; Private hospitals can supplement services that public hospitals

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#56:1>
For example , we can provide X-ray services to public hospitals if
the queue is long .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#57:1>
If private hospitals have a higher number of patients , we can make
the services more efficient and cheaper . &rdquo; </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#58:1>

<p> Dr Li , also the deputy medical superintendent of the Hong Kong
Sanatorium and Hospital , said his hospital , for example , was providing
discounted tumour scans to patients referred by the Hospital Authority . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#59:1>

<p> He is optimistic Hong Kong has the potential to become a regional centre
if the imbalance is solved . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#60:1>

<p> &ldquo; The private sector always has the advantage of bringing in new
technology quicker and we react faster to the market .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#61:1>
And we always believe that those who can afford to pay , should pay ,
&rdquo; he said . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#62:1>

<p> Change may be on the way .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#63:1>
The Medical Association is liaising with other medical groups to
launch private health-care reform in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#64:1>
The Government has also set up various working groups to discuss ways
to strengthen the relationship between the public and private sectors . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#65:1>

<p> If such reforms succeed , the Government  ' s plans to turn Hong Kong into
a medical centre for Asia may have a chance of success . </p>

<p> Since the atypical pneumonia outbreak , many Hong Kong people have got
closer to nature .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#69:2>
Shopping malls are out and hiking in the countryside is in .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#70:2>
Antibiotics are shunned and health products are in demand .

Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#74:2>

<p> With the Sars crisis abating , it is time to reflect on our relationship
with nature , green campaigners say .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#75:2>
Our growing concerns about healthy living may be encouraging .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#76:2>
But to prevent another crisis of similar magnitude , we should go one
step further by understanding how nature plays a part in our lives . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#77:2>

<p>  '   ' The Sars outbreak is an alarm call from nature telling us we  ' ve done
too much harm .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#78:2>
As well as trying to find a way to eradicate the virus , it is time
to do some soul-searching about why the disease broke out,' ' says Dan Yiu
Kun-yat , owner of Green Cottage , a health food store on Lamma Island .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#79:2>
 '  ' If we don't understand our relationship with nature , there may be
an outbreak of another disease.' ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#80:2>

<p> One aspect reflecting our poor sense of belonging to nature , according
to Yiu , is the heavy use of bleach in warding off the Sars virus .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#81:2>
 '  ' We  ' re killing many viruses and bacteria , including those that
may be beneficial to humans .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#82:2>
And the bleach may pollute fish and seafood .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#83:2>
Eventually &obrack;  the effects of &cbrack; the pollutants could come back to us
like a boomerang,' ' says Yiu , a member of the Lamma Island Environmentally
Concerned Group . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#84:2>

<p> He and his brother , Ron Yiu Kun-yat , a co-owner of Green Cottage , will
campaign against the use of bleach and raise awareness about green living on
Lamma later this month .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#85:2>
The campaign involves free distribution to Lamma residents of
hydrogen peroxide and baking soda - less harmful alternatives for cleaning ,
they say . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#86:2>

<p>  '   ' These cleaning agents are more environmentally friendly .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#87:2>
They decompose quicker than bleach and don't create as many harmful
elements to nature,' ' says Ron Yiu , who is also a member of the group .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#88:2>
 '  ' I think the government is pushing the environment to its limit by
calling on people to use bleach every day.' ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#89:2>

<p> The brothers , whose island has seen a flood of local visitors since the
Sars outbreak , say they have witnessed more harmful acts against nature than
the use of bleach . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#90:2>

<p>  '   ' Many people now go to the countryside instead of shopping malls at
weekends .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#91:2>
But some of them are only moving to a different venue to practise
their habits .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#92:2>
They eat and drink , throw away rubbish and spit as usual,' ' Dan Yiu
says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#93:2>
 '  ' Many people may take more vitamin C and less antibiotics , but I
don't think their underlying attitude towards nature has changed .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#94:2>
Consumerism still takes precedence over nature.' ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#95:2>

<p> But Man Chi-sum , the chief executive of Green Power , is more upbeat .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#96:2>
 '  ' There are good things coming out of Sars,' ' he says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#97:2>
 '  ' Many people have actually shown more care towards their
surrounding environment and the community .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#98:2>
They have also become more health-conscious.' ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#99:2>

<p> Man is optimistic that a change of attitude towards the environment will
persist with the rising threat of health crises .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#100:2>
 '  ' Sars is hard to eradicate,' ' he says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#101:2>
 '  ' And with summer approaching , a recurrence of the dengue fever
outbreak is looming .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#102:2>
I believe people will continue to stay health-conscious and care
more about the environment than before .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#103:2>
But of course the change won't happen overnight.' ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#104:2>

<p> Vegetarian Society of Hong Kong president Simon Chau Siu-cheong , one of
the pioneers in promoting green living in Hong Kong , says the outbreak is
more than a warning .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#105:2>
 '  ' It  ' s an ultimatum for us to change our lifestyle,' ' he says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#106:2>
 '  ' Nature is telling us that if we don't acknowledge our
relationship with it and make changes , we will sooner or later die from
different kinds of virus .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#107:2>
We deserve the Sars outbreak because we have been leading an
unhealthy life: we don't take enough rest; we eat too much meat; we depend on
doctors too much .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#108:2>
And we don't respect nature .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#109:2>
For us , nature is to be consumed , not protected .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#110:2>
But it will get back at us , like it has done with Sars.' ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#111:2>

<p> Chau , who advocates living a simple life that features no mobile phone
and no television at home , calls on people to make revolutionary changes to
their lifestyle .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#112:2>
His suggestions include cutting consumption of meat and making
frequent visits to the countryside instead of shopping malls .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#113:2>
He also suggests avoiding air travel .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#114:2>
 '  ' It is detrimental to our health and to the environment,' ' Chau
says . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#115:2>

<p>  '   ' We have to consider that Hong Kong is a city,' ' says Man .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#116:2>
 '  ' While we should encourage people to get closer to nature , we
also need to engage in economic activities .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#117:2>
We can't hide ourselves up a mountain .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#118:2>
We can't avoid taking public transport .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#119:2>
What is most important is to strike a balance between green living
and living in a city . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#120:2>

<p>  '   ' The least we can do is maintain good personal hygiene .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#121:2>
People should stop combing their hair and snipping their fingernails
on the MTR , which is ridiculous in a developed place .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#122:2>
Some couples even squeeze each other  ' s spots .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#123:2>
It  ' s not only a disgusting sight , it may also spread disease.''
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#124:2>

<p> The Yiu brothers , however , believe all behavioural changes boil down to
people  ' s respect for nature . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#125:2>

<p>  '   ' We  ' re part of nature,' ' says Ron Yiu .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#126:2>
 '  ' What nature gives us is usually the best , and if we are reckless
with it , eventually we  ' ll be the ones who suffer .

<ICE-HK:W2B-024#127:2>
When we understand this , our behaviour will change naturally.''
