<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-014#234:1:A>
Not not too much

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#235:1:A>
Actually for the guys the Hong Kong market is not so good for the
guys

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#236:1:A>
I think so

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X237:1:Z>
Not too good though for shows like I mean like TDC their very few
things like TDC </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-014#238:1:A>
Actually TDC is not that <.> prestig </.>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X239:1:Z>
Prestigious </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-014#240:1:A>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-014#243:1:A>
It  ' s okay

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#244:1:A>
The payment is okay <{> <[> but I </[> think for for the
prestigious is not so

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#245:1:A>
Doesn't like as before because before may be two years or three
years ago if you do the TDC show it  ' s wow

We we did the summer fashion week <{2> <[2> and </[2> Anna is the
<{3> <[3> choreographer </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#256:1:A>
She suppose from the schedule they said we have to work four hours
for the rehearsal but Anna make it up to eight hours

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X257:1:Z>
<[1> <?> Why </?> </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X258:1:Z>
<[2> Right </[2> </{2> ]

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X259:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#263:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X264:1:Z>
There  ' s not as many shows now as you used to be

<[> And </[> </{> I think the coming year ninety-five they
still have the Pacific Place fashion show in spring and summer and Landmark
as well

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#272:1:A>
I think Landmark is Richard doing it

<$Z> <X>

of money until you become a little bit well known

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X291:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X642:1:Z>
You get to go to the tunnel every day </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-014#643:1:A>
Yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X644:1:Z>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X645:1:Z>
Does it take long </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-014#646:1:A>
<{> <[> Sometimes </[> it takes quite long may be forty-five
up to one <.> h </.> forty-five minutes up to one hour

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#647:1:A>
<{> <[> But </[> sometimes it took me today it only took me thirty
minutes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X648:1:Z>
<[> Can you drive </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X649:1:Z>
<[> All right </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X650:1:Z>
Actually from Shek Kip Mei that area is quite easy to get through
the tunnel

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X651:1:Z>
Easier than other places </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-014#652:1:A>
Yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X653:1:Z>
Because you come in from the right side

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X654:1:Z>
Everybody come in the other ways

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X655:1:Z>
<{1> <[1> It  ' s </[1> very <{2> <[2> long </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X656:1:Z>
And then traffic

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X657:1:Z>
It  ' s better

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X658:1:Z>
And night time when you drive back driving Central back </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-014#659:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#660:1:A>

Ten minutes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-014#663:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#664:1:A>
But actually I feel it  ' s dangerous to drive in the night time
because the other cars they  ' re driving so fast

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X665:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-014#666:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X667:1:Z>
I have noticed it  ' s been dangerous but I know it was so much
faster

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X668:1:Z>
Like if we go and you eat dinner late or you go out have a drink
with friends and then leave down there like twelve o'clock or four o'clock
from Central and then come <{> <[> go back </[> there </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-014#669:1:A>
<[> Only take you </[> </{> ten minutes fifteen <{> <[>

Hi Alan

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-014#774:1:A>
Do you work with Alan before

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X775:1:Z>
Yes I work with him a long time ago

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X776:1:Z>
One of the first I came here for the show David and I

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X777:1:Z>
David Lim and I

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X778:1:Z>
And we did uhm the show but it was doing some walking steps that
we kind of very flighty you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X779:1:Z>
A bit too flighty and we buck

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X780:1:Z>
We didn't want to do those and somehow he overheard us made the
comment from me

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X781:1:Z>
I think maybe

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X782:1:Z>
I wasn't saying anything about him just the steps but I don't he
never like me after that

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X783:1:Z>
For a long time he never book me for a show

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X784:1:Z>
Never ever than finally Dunhill </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-014#785:1:A>
Dunhill

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#786:1:A>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X787:1:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X788:1:Z>
Dunhill booked me because they always book me full show and he
was doing that and so I work with him again

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X789:1:Z>
And then I think he liked after that I guess cos he knows I  ' m
you know when I do a show I don't miss out

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X790:1:Z>
I  ' m always there all the time and I don't mess around

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X791:1:Z>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X838:1:Z>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-014#840:1:A>

I didn't ask that I just we didn't ask how much about how much
they get paid for the show </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-014#851:1:A>
But I heard there  ' s some people some models they do working
as a freelance in China uh such as Shanghai or Beijing

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#852:1:A>
They can get the same rate in Hong Kong

<$Z> <X>

Right there is more here because the economy is bigger here than
in China

<ICE-HK:S1A-014#X862:1:Z>
You mean the market in China is going to be very big
