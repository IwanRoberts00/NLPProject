<ICE-HK:W2B-026#3:1>
<bold> Bauhinias &obrack;  <it> <foreign> Bauhinia </foreign> </it> spp.)
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#4:1>
The <it> <foreign> Bauhinia </foreign> </it> genus has several
hundred species characterized by deeply-cleft two-lobed leaves that resemble
in outline the camel  ' s hoof .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#5:1>
The wide geographical range covers the Old and the New Worlds tropics
in both hemispheres .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#6:1>
Most species produce large , showy and fragrant flowers with an
orchid-like structure .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#7:1>
They are some of the most attractive flowering trees , referred to
collectively as Butterfly Trees , that are widely planted in warm areas as
ornamental in gardens , parks and roadsides .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#8:1>
While some species are trees , others are shrubs and climbers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#9:1>
The genus name <it> <foreign> Bauhinia </foreign> </it>
commemorates two Swiss botanist brothers John &obrack;  1541-1613 &cbrack; and Casper &obrack; 
1560-1624 &cbrack; Bauhin .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#10:1>
The two lobes of the leaves symbolize the two brothers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#11:1>
The specific epithet of the species , <it> <foreign> Bauhinia
</foreign> blakeana </it> &obrack;  Hong Kong Orchid Tree &cbrack; commemorates Sir Henry
Blake , the Governor of Hong Kong &obrack;  1898-1903 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#12:1>
The tree was first discovered by the fathers of a French mission
situated on a hilltop near the sea in Pokfulam .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#13:1>
The species was approved as our city  ' s emblem flower in 1965 by the
Urban Council which also adopted the stylised form as its logo . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#14:1>
Hong Kong Orchid Tree , an indigenous evergreen , is one of the
most beautiful Bauhinias in cultivation .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#15:1>
It produces large deep purple-red flowers with a delicate scent in
profusion from late autumn to early spring .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#16:1>
Even rather scrawny and short trees can manage to send out a
reasonable show .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#17:1>
Although a maximum height of about 10 metres can be reached , many
have a dwarfing tendency .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#18:1>
A handsome and tall specimen can be found in the memorial garden of
City Hall &obrack;  Fig . 2.1 &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#19:1>
The tree is sterile , that is , viable seeds cannot be produced .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#20:1>
It is believed to be a cross between two allied species , namely B .
<it> variegata </it> and B. <it> purpurea </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#21:1>
The offspring of such union of two species , known as hybrids , are
often unable to reproduce successfully by normal means .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#22:1>
The tree is therefore propagated vegetatively , usually by means of
stem cuttings . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#23:1>
The tree prospers in sunny sites sheltered from cold and salty
winds and prefers well-drained , deep , friable and fertile soils .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#24:1>
It has a tendency to develop anon-erect trunk and an untidy branching
form .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#25:1>
A more upright habit , however , can be encouraged by the removal of
some competing leaders when the tress is still young .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#26:1>
Such artificial means to improve a tree  ' s form is known as <bold>
branch training . </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#27:1>
Two other <foreign> Bauhinia </foreign> trees , both deciduous ,
are commonly planted in Hong Kong . The Camel  ' s Foot or Poor Man  ' s Orchid &obrack; 
B. <it> variegata </it>  &cbrack; was introduced from south China .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#28:1>
It gets the specific epithet form the streaky or variegated colours
of the dominantly pinkish petals .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#29:1>
The flowering period , from spring to early summer , is different
from the other <foreign> Bauhinia </foreign> trees .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#30:1>
Often the blossom appears before the formation of new leaves .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#31:1>
A <it> <foreign> candida </foreign> </it> variety carries white
flowers which bloom after the emergence of a new foliage . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#32:1>
Camel  ' s Foot is a short tree with a maximum height of 6 metres .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#33:1>
It is the shortest of the locally cultivated <foreign> Bauhinia
</foreign> trees .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#34:1>
The branches are fewer , stronger , and tend to take up a more erect
posture in comparison with its allies .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#35:1>
Large pods , up to 30 cm long , turn from green to a ripened black
and hang on the tree in summer . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#36:1>
The deciduous Purple Camel  ' s Foot &obrack;  B. <it> purpurea </it>  &cbrack; is
native to Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#37:1>
The specific epithet refers to the colour of the fragrant flowers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#38:1>
They appear in late autumn to early winter , a period that coincides
with the early part of Hong Kong Orchid  ' s long flowering duration .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#39:1>
The tree has larger leaves up to 20 cm long with a deeper notch
between the two lobes &obrack;  Fig . 2.2 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#40:1>
Although a maximum height of 10 metres can be attainted , it is
usually much shorter .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#41:1>
Large <bold> <foreign> legume </foreign> </bold> pods similar to
Camel  ' s Foot are set in spring .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#42:1>
The tree is tolerant of and is in fact improved by pruning . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#43:1>
The Yellow-flowered <foreign> Bauhinia </foreign> &obrack;  B . <it>
tomentosa </it>  &cbrack; , originated from India , is sometimes planted in gardens
and parks .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#44:1>
It is an evergreen with a shrubby habit that reaches a maximum height
of 3 metres .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#45:1>
A good specimen is found in the Zoological and Botanical Gardens near
the greenhouse on the Garden Road side .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#46:1>
The specific epithet means hairy in Latin , referring to the soft
yellow hairs found on the lower surface of leaves and on fruits .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#47:1>
The rounded leaves , about 3-7 cm long , are much smaller than the
tree Bauhinias . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#48:1>
<bold> Golden Shower &obrack;  <it> <foreign> Cassia fistula </foreign> </it> )
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#49:1>
This is a small deciduous tree native to south Asia , including
India , Sri Lanka and Burma . It has been widely cultivated in the tropics as
an ornamental tree .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#50:1>
All the <it> <foreign> Cassia </foreign> </it> trees in Hong Kong are
introduced species . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#51:1>
The large <foreign> Cassia </foreign> genus has more than 600
species of trees , shrubs and herbs with a pantropical distribution .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#52:1>
Many species are amongst the most beautiful flowering and decorative
trees for the tropics .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#53:1>
They are commonly called Shower Trees because of the profuse petal
falls that often carpet the ground underneath the canopy .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#54:1>
Besides the blossoms , they also possess fine-textured foliage and
handsome tree form .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#55:1>
The genus belongs to the <foreign> Senna </foreign> subfamily &obrack; 
Caesalpiniaceae &cbrack; of the huge Pea family &obrack;  Leguminosae &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#56:1>
Golden Shower can reach 8-10 metres in favourable sites .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#57:1>
The crown , with a not-too-spreading span of 4-6 metres , has an
irregular shape .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#58:1>
The foliage density is rather high , and the branchlets droop down
gracefully .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#59:1>
The single main trunk tends to fork at a low level into a few large
limbs .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#60:1>
The bark is dark brown and relatively smooth . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#61:1>
The genus name is derived from the Greek word <it> <foreign>
kassia </foreign> </it> given to a related species .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#62:1>
The specific <foreign> epithet </foreign> comes from the Latin word
meaning a pipe , referring to the long cylindrical fruits .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#63:1>
It is also known commonly as Indian Laburnum and Pudding Pipe Tree .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#64:1>
The pinnate leaves &obrack;  Fig . 2.3 &cbrack; , alternately arranged on the
twigs , assume the pendulous disposition .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#65:1>
Each <bold> compound leaf <bold> , 40-60 cm long , is composed of 4-8
pairs of <bold> leaflets </bold> .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#66:1>
Oppositely arranged on their axis , the ovate leaflet measures 12-15
cm long and 6-8 cm wide .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#67:1>
They have pointed tips and rounded bases , and are bright green above
, paler and duller below .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#68:1>
The midrib is prominent on the lower surface . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#69:1>
Masses of very spectacular floral display can be enjoyed in early
summer .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#70:1>
They occur in clusters of up to 80 cm long that hang gracefully on
the crown surface .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#71:1>
A healthy tree in full bloom can be wrapped around by the golden
yellow flowers , each of which measured about 5 cm across .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#72:1>
It is undeniably the most splendid of the yellow-flowered <it>
<foreign> Cassia </foreign> </it> trees . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#73:1>
The fruits provide another distinct feature .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#74:1>
They are long cylindrical pods that hang on the tree for a long time .
Each measures 40-60 cm long and 2-3 cm in diameter , and changes form the
initial green to chocolate brown and eventually almost black .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#75:1>
Their resemblance to sausages is the basis for the local Chinese name  ' sausage
tree ' . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#76:1>
The tree  ' s native habitats are characterized by a long dry
season , hence it is tolerant of drought .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#77:1>
It needs a sunny site with light-textured and adequately-drained soil .
In view of sensitivity to strong winds , a sheltered position should be
chosen .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#78:1>
It is intolerant of salinity in the soil and air . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#79:1>
The tree is best suited to ornamental planting in single rows
along roads and edges of green spaces .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#80:1>
The low branching height can be rectified as early as possible by
pruning . Besides the showy flowers and interesting fruits , a good shading
effect can be obtained . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#81:1>
The branches , leaves and seeds contain a slightly poisonous
substance which has folk-medicinal uses .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#82:1>
The sweet sticky pulp obtainable from the pods is used as a laxative
, and also mixed with tobaccos and smoked in India .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#83:1>
The bark yields tannin and a red dye .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#84:1>
The hard , beautiful and decay-resistant wood is unfortunately not
easy to work . It is mainly used for bridges , poles and miscellaneous
agricultural implements . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#85:1>
The tree is sometimes planted in parks and gardens but rarely at
roadsides .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#86:1>
Specimens can be viewed in Charter Garden , Upper Albert Road &obrack;  near
the Government House &cbrack; , and Middle Road Garden . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#87:1>
<bold> Pink-and-white Shower &obrack;  <it> <foreign> Cassia </foreign>
nodosa </it>  &cbrack; </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#88:1>
<bold> Pink Shower &obrack;  <it> C . javanica </it>  &cbrack; </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#89:1>
Both medium-sized deciduous trees set beautiful pinkish flowers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#90:1>
Like a number of other <it> <foreign> Cassia </foreign> </it> species
, they have been widely adopted as ornamental trees in the tropics . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#91:1>
Pink-and-white Shower originally inhabits a small south Asian
range that covers north India , Bangladesh , Burma and the Andaman Islands .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#92:1>
The specific epithet means nodes or joints in Latin , referring to
the swollen part in the middle of the long filaments &obrack;  the stalk of stamens ,
the male reproductive flower parts &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#93:1>
The common name describes the flower colour .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#94:1>
Notes on the genus have been given in the section on Golden Shower .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#95:1>
The tree can reach more than 15 metres in its homeland , but the
cultivated specimens generally stop growing at 10 metres .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#96:1>
The crown assumes a spreading and graceful habit .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#97:1>
The dark greyish-brown bark has a smooth surface . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#98:1>
The pinnate leaves are alternately arranged on the twigs .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#99:1>
Each compound leaf consists of 5-12 pairs of leaflets of variable
shape .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#100:1>
They are mainly ovate to elliptic , about 4-6 cm long and 1.3-2 cm
wide , with pointed tips . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#101:1>
The bright pink flowers , about 2 cm across , carry a sweet
scent .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#102:1>
Masses of them begin to appear in spring when the tree is still
leafless , and keep on blooming for some weeks .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#103:1>
Upon ageing , they gradually fade into white before falling off .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#104:1>
Large cylindrical pods up to 60 cm long , and maturing to a smooth
black colour , dangle on the tree subsequently . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#105:1>
The Pink Shower is a very similar tree that grows to about the
same height and spread as Pink-and-white Shower .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#106:1>
The major difference is the presence of sharp spur-like spines on
the trunk and main branches of Pink shower .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#107:1>
It also has larger and therefore more conspicuous <bold> stipules
</bold> &obrack;  bract-like structure at the base of leaf stalks &cbrack; that are up to 2
cm long .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#108:1>
Otherwise , the foliage features of the two trees are alike . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#109:1>
Pink Shower has a homeland that centres in Java , Sumatra and
the Philippines .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#110:1>
The specific epithet suggests its geographical origin .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#111:1>
It is also called Rainbow Shower and Apple-blossom <foreign> Cassia
</foreign> .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#112:1>
The latter describes the masses of pink flowers covering nearly the
whole crown in a manner reminiscent of the apple blossoms of temperate areas
in terms of colour and luxuriance .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#113:1>
The rather long-lasting flowers appear in mid-summer .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#114:1>
Very similar long cylindrical pods are also set . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#115:1>
It appears that the two quite analogous species can hybridise
freely in cultivation .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#116:1>
For this reason , they may represent a limited range of genetic
variability within one species .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#117:1>
In fact , C . <it> nodosa </it> is sometimes regarded as a variety
of C. <it> javanica </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#118:1>
Some taxonomic authorities regard these two trees as subspecies <it>
javanica </it> and subspecies <it> nodosa </it> of the species C. <it>
javanica </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#119:1>
This pair of trees illustrate the rather fluid concept of a species
especially in borderline cases . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#120:1>
Both trees are not particularly demanding in their soil
requirements .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#121:1>
For good performance , they should be planted in well-drained
sandy-loamy soils of medium fertility level .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#122:1>
Their shallow roots do not provide a very strong footing , hence
they should not be exposed to strong wind .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#123:1>
Full-sun positions are expected . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#124:1>
They are high-quality ornamental trees in terms of magnificent
blossoms , graceful crown spread and fine-textured foliage .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#125:1>
As long as growth spaces are sufficient , they should fit in with a
wide range of landscape situations .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#126:1>
Roadside planting is restricted by the outstretched branches .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#127:1>
The roots of Pink-and-white shower are used as soap in Malaysia .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#128:1>
The heavy and hard wood may also serve general uses such as
furniture and tool making . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#129:1>
A good specimen of Pink-and-white Shower has been salvaged on
the Cotton Tree Drive side of the Murray Building .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#130:1>
Other trees of both species may be found in the Zoological and
Botanical Gardens &obrack;  Fig . 2.4 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#131:1>
Elsewhere they are uncommonly cultivated . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#132:1>
<bold> Kassod Tree &obrack;  <it> <foreign> Cassia </foreign> siamea </it> )
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#133:1>
The Kassod Tree is a member of the large <it> <foreign> Cassia
</foreign> </it> genus with well over 700 species of herbs , shrubs and trees
common in the warm areas of both hemispheres .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#134:1>
The genus in turn belongs to the <foreign> Senna </foreign>
subfamily &obrack;  Caesalpiniaceae &cbrack; of the huge Pea family &obrack;  Leguminosae &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#135:1>
Some recent botanical publications have allocated the species to the
genus <foreign> Senna </foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#136:1>
The species is found naturally in a belt that covers India , Sri
Lanka , Thailand and Malaysia .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#137:1>
It has been widely adopted in modern times both as an ornamental and
an economic tree throughout the tropics . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#138:1>
The genus name <foreign> Cassia </foreign> is derived from the
Greek name <it> <foreign> Kassia </foreign> </it> given to a related species .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#139:1>
The specific epithet refers to one of its indigenous homes in Siam ,
the old name of Thailand . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#140:1>
The tree can reach a maximum height of 20 metres , though in
cultivation the usual final height is a subdued 12 metres .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#141:1>
The somewhat rounded crown tends to become irregular in old trees .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#142:1>
The stout limbs bear both erect and drooping branches .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#143:1>
With a crown span of 5-8 metres , it is not particularly demanding
on growth space .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#144:1>
The dark-brown bark usually has a smooth surface . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#145:1>
The leaves , alternately arranged on the twigs , has a
feather-like &obrack;  pinnate &cbrack; compound arrangement .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#146:1>
Each leaf usually has 8-9 pairs of leaflets organized oppositely on
the leaf axis .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#147:1>
The leaflets , narrowly elliptic in shape , are about 5-8 cm long
and 1-2 cm wide .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#148:1>
Both the tip and the base of the leaflets are blunt .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#149:1>
The smooth greenish upper surface is contrasted by a somewhat soft
and hairy underside . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#150:1>
The pale yellow flowers , about 3 cm in diameter , are rather
showy .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#151:1>
They also carry a delicate fragrance , and occur as terminal
clusters towards the ends of branches in summer months . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#152:1>
The flat pods typical of many <bold> <foreign> leguminous
</foreign> plants </bold> are about 20 cm long and 1-2 cm wide .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#153:1>
They are dark brown on ripening , rather hard , and tend to hang on
the tree for many months .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#154:1>
Under proper storage conditions , the seeds can remain viable for
over 20 years . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#155:1>
The evergreen Kassod Tree is not demanding on soil and climatic
requirements .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#156:1>
It can tolerate infertile and coarse-textured soils , and a wide
range of soil reactions ranging from acidic to slightly alkaline .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#157:1>
It can grow well in both wet and droughty soils .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#158:1>
For the best performance , a deep and well-drained soil in a
full-sun location should be selected .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#159:1>
It can stand up quite well to strong wind and polluted air . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#160:1>
Kassod Tree is widely used as a shade-cum-ornamental tree in
human settlements .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#161:1>
The final size is too large for our cramped roadside habitats ,
hence it is more suitable for parks and gardens , or where wide planting
strips are available . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#162:1>
Besides , the tree is often used to afforest barren hill-slopes
in the tropics .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#163:1>
The strong capability to resprout quickly from cut surfaces allows a
frequent harvest .

<ICE-HK:W2B-026#164:1>
The wood is highly combustible and makes a ready source of good
quality firewood for some rural communities in developing countries . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-026#165:1>
