No vehicle is allowed to be driven or used on a road unless it is
registered and licensed . </p>

Registration , which is normally a one-off matter , means giving
the vehicle a registration mark and putting it into its appropriate class ,
e.g. private car , light goods vehicle , etc .

<ICE-HK:W2D-009#4:1>
Licensing , which is annually or four-monthly , conveys the right for
a vehicle to be driven on a road .

A local motor vehicle agent usually applies for registration and
licensing of a vehicle on behalf of its client .

<ICE-HK:W2D-009#6:1>

required to pay first registration tax , nor is he required to produce any
third party risk insurance certificate or cover note for his vehicle . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-009#30:1>

<bold> Allocation of Registration Marks </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-009#38:1>
If an application for registration of a vehicle is in order , the
vehicle will be assigned a registration mark consisting of a number of not
more than 4 digits other than special registration mark &obrack; commonly
known as &lsquo; lucky numbers &rsquo; &cbrack; , with prefix letters .

<ICE-HK:W2D-009#39:1>
In the case of trailers , the registration mark will consist of a
number of not more than 5 digits and the suffix &lsquo; T &rsquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-009#40:1>
&lsquo; Lucky numbers &rsquo; are allocated only after sale by
public auction which takes place from time to time .

<ICE-HK:W2D-009#41:1>
The proceeds of the auction goes to the Government Lotteries Fund to
be used for charitable purposes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-009#42:1>
Once allocated , a special registration mark cannot be
transferred to another person .

<ICE-HK:W2D-009#43:1>
If the owner of a vehicle with a special registration mark wishes to
transfer the vehicle to someone else , the Transport Department is legally
bound , before registering the transfer , to recover the special registration
mark , register the vehicle with ordinary registration mark and then register
the transfer .

<ICE-HK:W2D-009#44:1>
But , on payment of a prescribed fee , the owner of a vehicle with a
special registration mark may apply on form TD 129 to transfer the special
registration mark to another vehicle registered in his name . </p> <h>

&obrack; Vehicle Design Standards &cbrack; &obrack; Emission &cbrack;

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-009#53:1>
Vehicle licence may be renewed within four months before expiry
on application form TD 23/12 &obrack; for one year &cbrack; or TD 23/4
&obrack; for four months &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2D-009#54:1>
If an application is made after the expiry of the licence , the
renewed licence will run from the date of issue of licence .

<ICE-HK:W2D-009#55:1>
The total fee paid in this case is the licence fee plus an additional
charge , which is 0.33 per cent of the licence fee for each day of the
unlicensed period since the previous licence expired . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2D-009#56:1>
<bold> Duplicates </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-009#57:1>
If your vehicle registration document or licence has been lost ,
destroyed or defaced , you should apply for a duplicate .

<ICE-HK:W2D-009#58:1>
In the case of loss of registration document , you should report to a
police station in the district where the loss occurred .

<ICE-HK:W2D-009#59:1>
With a police certificate , you should apply to a licensing office
for a duplicate , using form TD 151 and paying the prescribed fee . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2D-009#60:1>
<bold> Vehicle Transfer </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-009#61:1>
Within 72 hours on the change of ownership of a vehicle , a
notice of transfer on form TD 25 must be lodged with the Transport Department
licensing office , as proof that the transferor and transferee agree to the
transaction .

<ICE-HK:W2D-009#62:1>
As required by law , the new owner should deliver the original of the
notice to the Transport Department , and the former owner the duplicate .

<ICE-HK:W2D-009#63:1>
There were cases in which transferees failed to take this procedure ,
thus , no transfer is registered and the vehicle remains registered in the
name of the former owner , to whom all fixed penalty tickets are sent .

<ICE-HK:W2D-009#64:1>
Therefore , it is advisable that the former owner should call at the
licensing office together with the new owner to hand in both portions of the
notice of transfer &obrack; duly completed and signed &cbrack; so as to
effect the transfer immediately .

<ICE-HK:W2D-009#65:1>
<bold> A former owner should not hand over the vehicle registration
document to the new owner until the Transport Department has registered the
transfer .

<ICE-HK:W2D-009#66:1>
</bold> The new owner  ' s original identification documents should be
produced . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-009#67:1>
When applying for transfer of ownership , the former owner and
the new owner should also declare the transaction price of the motor vehicle
on form TD 25 .

<ICE-HK:W2D-009#68:1>
If the declared transaction price is greater than the last taxable
value , the value of any exempted accessories , the value of any unexpired
portion of a warranty other than a manufacturer  ' s warranty plus the first
registration tax paid , the former owner should apply to the Hong Kong
Licensing Office on application form TD 468 for approval and should pay the
additional tax before the transfer of ownership is effected . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-009#69:1>
It is equally important for a prospective transferee to ensure
that there are no outstanding penalties or possible licence suspension in
respect of the vehicle .

<ICE-HK:W2D-009#70:1>
There are numerous cases whereby a transferee finds himself legally
liable to payment of fixed penalty tickets , or the vehicle licence is
suspended because the former owner has failed to disclose such information .

<ICE-HK:W2D-009#71:1>
<bold> To guard against this , a new owner is advised before
acquiring a vehicle to apply to a licensing office for the relevant
Certificate of Clearance .

<ICE-HK:W2D-009#72:1>
The Certificate , issued free of charge , is valid for 72 hours and
certifies that the vehicle is free of outstanding penalties and is not liable
to licence suspension . </bold> </p> <h>

<bold> Change of Registration Particulars </bold> </h>

<p>

office of the Transport Department on form TD 150 within 72 hours of any
change in respect of registration particulars , e.g. his name , address ,
identity document , or the colour , engine number , or seating capacity of
his vehicle , etc .

<ICE-HK:W2D-009#75:1>
