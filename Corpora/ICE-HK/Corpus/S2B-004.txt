Today most of its Russian counterparts have already gone into
private hands <,> but this factory is only beginning to learn a few basic
fact about market economy <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-004#82:2:A>
It has just been made responsible for its own losses <,> and it no
longer receives any government subsidies <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-004#83:2:A>
The changes only occurred after Deng Xiao Ping made his most
publicized tour to Southern China earlier this year

<ICE-HK:S2B-004#84:2:A>
The <?> paramount </?> leader made it clear then that China must
open up to market economy

<ICE-HK:S2B-004#85:2:A>
His message is delivered in the banners all over the factory <,>
but things are easier said than done <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-004#86:2:A>
The factory now has a serious cash flow problem <,> because other
state-run enterprises are undergoing similar transformations <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-004#87:2:A>
