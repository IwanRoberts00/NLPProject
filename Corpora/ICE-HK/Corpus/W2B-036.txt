An indication that Hong Kong is beginning to embrace electronic
commerce is the increasing enthusiasm for use of digital identification
certificates . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#5:1>
These certificates , known as &ldquo; E-Certs &rdquo; , allow
Internet users to prove their identity and enter into agreements with
security on open communications networks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#6:1>
Hongkong Post became the SAR  ' s first public certification
authority in January last year , and facilitated online activities in banking
, stock-trading , education , entertainment and government services . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#7:1>
The &dollar;60 million public key infrastructure &obrack;  PKI &cbrack; ,
developed by Hewlett-Packard , allows Hongkong Post to act as an independent
trusted party in issuing e-Certs , which are the equivalent of identity cards
in the online world .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#8:1>
Issued to individuals and organizations , e-Certs authenticate a
person  ' s identity and verify that message contents have not been altered
during transmission . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#9:1>
Users may choose to have their communication protected by
encryption - which changes a message into an incomprehensible form by an
electronic &ldquo; key" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#10:1>
Each user of the PKI has a &ldquo; private key &rdquo; in the
possession of the user , and a &ldquo; public key &rdquo; in a directory
maintained by Hongkong Post for verification purposes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#11:1>
The PKI provides a &ldquo; digital signature &rdquo; of a user which
has the same legal status as a signature on paper .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#12:1>
This was made possible following enactment of the Electronic
Transactions Ordinance in January last year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#13:1>
According to Michael Chung Man-kit , senior manager at the
electronic services division of Hongkong Post e-Cert , each e-Cert is valid
for a year , &ldquo; and its user is given maximum protection of &dollar;1
million by Hongkong Post" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#14:1>
Hongkong Post co-launched a secure electronic mail service with
Pacific Century CyberWorks in May last year , and the Hong Kong Jockey Club
has introduced the security system into its Internet betting service . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#15:1>
Mr Chung said Hongkong Post had signed agreements with Dah Sing
Bank , Hong Kong Chinese Bank and Bank of East Asia to offer secure online
banking services and Visa International had signed a memorandum of
understanding in May for embedding e-Cert into the company  ' s planned
multi-application &ldquo; smart &rdquo; credit cards . </p>

Pirated Microsoft software is still widely available in Hong Kong
despite efforts in recent years to crack down on it . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#19:2>
A team from the South China Most Post on Monday found pirated
copies of Microsoft software being covertly sold for as little as &dollar;30
in Shamshuipo on the day the computer giant announced it would cut the price
of legitimate software to tackle piracy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#20:2>
It found the price difference between legitimate and pirated
software remained so wide that the price cut would have little effect on the
black market . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#21:2>
The going price for pirated Window XP software is as low as
&dollar;30 , and a full pirated version of Microsoft Office XP can be bought
for just &dollar;50.

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#22:2>
Even after the price cut , a genuine copy of Office XP costs
&dollar;4,229 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#23:2>
The Post found four stores selling illegal copies of Microsoft
products in Shamshuipo , in Golden Shopping Centre and Golden Computer Arcade .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#24:2>
Although pirated software remains widely available and cheap ,
buying it is not as simple as it used to be .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#25:2>
Customers can no longer select a software CD from a rack and pay for
it .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#26:2>
None of the shops in the two centers stock the pirated Microsoft
software on their shelves .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#27:2>
Customers are asked to select software from a list or booklet of
software titles .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#28:2>
&ldquo; We can't put &obrack;  pirated &cbrack; products from big companies like
Microsoft up on the shelves because they can sue us , &rdquo; one shopkeeper
at the Golden Shopping Centre said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#29:2>
&ldquo; It  ' s difficult to do business these days because the
Customs officers come here every day.

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#30:2>
But buyers don't have to worry about getting caught .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#31:2>
If anything , we  ' re the one in trouble . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#32:2>
At least three men in each store watch out for Customs officers .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#33:2>
After selecting a software item and paying for it , the buyer is
given a slip with the price and a four-digit code . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#34:2>
At one shop , the buyer was told to go to a restaurant across the
street to collect the software .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#35:2>
A man standing on the street in front of the restaurant keeps the
disks for purchasing in a bag kept in the building . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#36:2>
Despite frequent visits by the Customs and Excise Department ,
the Post saw the pirated software shops doing a brisk business to both
expatriates and local customers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#37:2>
At one store , eight customers picked up their disks within five
minutes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#38:2>
A store selling at this rate and open for 10 hours a day could sell
to about 900 customers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#39:2>
The price of pirated software was similar to all the shops
visited .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#40:2>
A pirated software CD sells for &dollar;30 , or five for &dollar;100 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#41:2>
Pirated Chinese versions of the Window XP operating system and
Microsoft Office XP Professional can be purchased for &dollar;100 , compared
with &dollar;5,624 for the legal version . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#42:2>
The pirated disks come with a piece of paper with a colour copy
of the Window logo wrapped in clear plastic .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#43:2>
The serial number needed to register the software is on the wrapper .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#44:2>
If the pirated software fails to work , shoppers can return it ,
according to one shopkeeper who said his disks carried special marks . </p>

<bold> Expert highlights computer research used by the US military
</bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#47:3>
<bold> Alex Lo </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#48:3>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#49:3>
State-of-the-art computer-simulated epidemics used by the US
military in defence programmes against biological warfare may prove useful in
halting the spread of the virus , a computer scientist and entrepreneur said .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#50:3>
While admitting that it may be too late to use such advanced
software programmes in the current crisis , Eberhard Schoneburg , chief
executive officer of Hong Kong-based Artificial Life Inc. , said they would
likely prove useful in containing future outbreaks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#51:3>
The company , which is listed on the US Nasdaq stock exchange ,
develops applications using advanced mathematical and computer theories for
hi-tech industries . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#52:3>
&ldquo; You have had several bird flu outbreaks and now Sars .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#53:3>
The chances are good there will be others , &rdquo; Mr Schoneburg
said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#54:3>
The computer techniques are called cellular automata , one of the
hottest research areas that combine computer science and branches of
mathematics called chaos and complexity theories . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#55:3>
By simulating realistic traffic , population and weather
conditions , as well as the disease  ' s medical characteristics using the new
techniques , policy-makers could work with various likely scenarios of how
an outbreak would spread and how the spread might be halted , such as by
erecting barriers and disrupting air travel patterns and imposing health
measures at critical centres or cities . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#56:3>
These inter-disciplinary theories are widely discussed and taught
in major universities around the world , including those in Hong Kong , but
their applications in epidemic studies are uncommon , Mr Schoneburg said .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#57:3>
&ldquo; I believe the US military is probably the only one that
widely uses these simulations .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#58:3>
It  ' s all classified and it  ' s very difficult for outsiders to get
contracts &obrack;  with the United States ' military &cbrack; , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#59:3>
The mathematician and computer scientist had worked in Germany
and the US before setting up his business in Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#60:3>
He explained how computer-simulated epidemics worked .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#61:3>
&ldquo; Neighbourhoods are not simply defined by physical distance ,
but by their connectivity through traffic , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#62:3>
&ldquo; If an infectious disease spreads from one place , many
other places that might be quite distant will report the outbreak of the same
disease after a period of time .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#63:3>
The simulation of spreading diseases helps to identify which places
are the most critical ones and what changes in &obrack;  air , sea and land &cbrack; traffic
have what effects on the spread of the disease . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#64:3>
Mr Schoneburg said Hong Kong and mainland authorities may
consider the new techniques in future outbreaks , but he added his company
had not approached any official agency . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#65:3>
Unlike traditional programming , the techniques specify a few
simple rules at the outset , so that the key computing components , or
cellular automata , can evolve , as if on their own , patterns and behaviour
that resemble real-life phenomena such as cell development , population
growth , biological evolution and a disease  ' s outbreak . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#66:3>
This is based on a fundamental principle in chaos and complexity
theories: tiny disturbances and variations , virtually impossible to take
into account at the outset , can lead to unpredictable outcomes.

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#67:3>
This chaos principle is used to contrast with classical dynamics
which say that if all the initial conditions are specified , all future
states can be precisely predicted . </p>

<bold> TONY FUNG </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#71:4>
The World Wide Web Consortium &obrack;  W3C &cbrack; , an international body
which creates Web standards , has a mission to lead the Web to its full
potential as a forum for information , commerce , inspiration , independent
thought and collective understanding . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#72:4>
It does so by developing technologies , specifications ,
guidelines , software and tools for the Web . Internet users often overlook
functions , other than enabling Web browsing , performed by the W3C . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#73:4>
Many people view the Web as a medium accessible by computers only .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#74:4>
The W3C defines the Web as the universe of network-accessible
information .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#75:4>
The rapid growth and evolution of Internet technologies makes this
universe available through your computer , mobile information device ,
television , networked refrigerator , digital camera or in-car computer .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#76:4>
Even more points of access will be available in the future . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#77:4>
Universal access to the Web is one of the W3C  ' s primary goals .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#78:4>
Efforts have been made to make the Web and its inherent benefits
available to all people , whatever their hardware , software , network
infrastructure , native language , culture , geographical location or
physical or mental ability .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#79:4>
Several W3C activities are paving the way to universal access . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#80:4>
The W3C Internationalisation Activity aims at ensuring Web
formats and protocols are usable worldwide in all languages and in all
writing systems . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#81:4>
An important area of this work is to build the Character Mode for
the World Wide Web , giving directions and guidelines to ensure that the
internationalisation features of the various W3C specifications fit together .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#82:4>
In addition to incorporating non-ASCII characters in Web
applications , style enhancements are necessary to cover Asian typography in
terms of writing direction , and text justification . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#83:4>
The W3C also actively collaborates with other groups , in
particular the Unicode Technical Committee , the Internet Engineering Task
Force , relevant industry standards committees and other groups to increase
awareness of internationalisation issues via conferences and workshops . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#84:4>
The W3C is dedicated to ensuring that the Web universe is not
fragmented in a way that only parts of the Web will be accessible from
disparate devices . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#85:4>
With regard to mobile Web and TV Web integration , the Device
Independence Activity is working to ensure seamless Web access with all kinds
of devices , and setting worldwide standards for the benefit of Web users and
content providers alike . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#86:4>
The W3C also helps people with physical or mental disabilities to
access the Web .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#87:4>
The Web Accessibility Initiative &obrack;  WAI &cbrack; aims at identifying and
solving problems people with disabilities have using the Web . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#88:4>
Other than working on research and development of technology and
tools &obrack;  such as voice browsing &cbrack; , the WAI offers guidelines and education and
outreach programmes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#89:4>
People share their knowledge on the Web by storing information in
human-understandable language only .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#90:4>
The W3C is now leading society to a Semantic Web by shifting the Web
from exclusively human-oriented content to more machine-understandable data .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#91:4>
Information will be more well-defined , better enabling computers
to interpret and exchange data .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#92:4>
Doing so will enable them to solve problems and perform tasks that we
find tedious , and will better help us find what we  ' re looking for . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#93:4>
The Semantic Web Activity  ' s goal is to extend the current Web to
facilitate discovery , automation , integration and re-use across various
applications .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#94:4>
The building blocks of the Semantic Web are the programming languages
developed by the W3C , such as RDF , XML , XML Schema and XML signatures .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#95:4>
The Web is no longer limited to boring browsing.

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#96:4>
Given the creativity of content providers , you can expect more
interactivity and richer media on the Web , including resizable images ,
quality sound , 3D video effects , animation and more .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#97:4>
The W3C  ' s XML-based development framework , the Scalable Vector
Graphics &obrack;  SVG &cbrack; language and the Synchronised Multimedia Integration Language
( SMIL &cbrack; all help enrich the Web . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#98:4>
SVG is an open-vector graphics format written in XML and designed
to work across platforms , output resolutions , colour spaces and a range of
available bandwidth . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#99:4>
Its XML-based nature makes it suitable to the applications ,
which enhances searchability and accessibility of the SVG graphics . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#100:4>
The Document Object Model for SVG allows straightforward and
efficient vector graphics animation and interaction via scripting . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#101:4>
SMIL is developed by the W3C  ' s Synchronised Multimedia Activity
, which has been focusing on enabling content authors to specify multimedia
presentations .

<ICE-HK:W2B-036#102:4>
Web authors use SMIL to schedule presentations of media components
such as audio , video , images or text in real time . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#103:4>
Additional functions including embedded hyperlinks and playback
control buttons are also supported . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-036#104:4>
The key to SMIL is its XML nature , which requires no
sophisticated authoring tools to produce . </p>
