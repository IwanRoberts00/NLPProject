<ICE-HK:W2F-016#2:1>
THE RESUSCITATION OF AQUARIUS </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#3:1>
'AQUARIUS - bad luck comes soon .  ' 

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#4:1>
The words which appeared in <it> The Zodiac Master </it> seemed to
haunt me all day long .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#5:1>
They were like a croaking crow , which spiralled round over my head ,
keeping me distracted from my work. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#6:1>
'What will the bad luck be ?  ' 

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#7:1>
I kept asking myself and pretended to be typing on the keyboard . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#8:1>
'Hey Sherry .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#9:1>
It  ' s eight already .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#10:1>
Everybody left except you and me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#11:1>
What stuff are you working with ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#12:1>
The promotion for the fireworks display at Victoria Harbour ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#13:1>
Maggie leaned toward the monitor and tried to figure out the string
of meaningless alphabets that I typed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#14:1>
'What are you tying ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#15:1>
Some password codes , I guess?'

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#16:1>
She teased me playfully. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#17:1>
'Nothing , I  ' m just thinking of what the bad luck will be .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#18:1>
Sort of pre-occupied by that, ' I said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#19:1>
'You mean the prediction of <it> The Zodiac Master </it> ?  '  I
nodded .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#20:1>
'Sherry , you  ' re a bit obsessed with it , aren't you ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#21:1>
It  ' s just some scribble anyway .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#22:1>
Don't be so gullible. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#23:1>
'But it  ' s reliable .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#24:1>
Sometimes it foretells accurately what I  ' m going to do or things
that happen to me. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#25:1>
'That  ' s mere coincidence .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#26:1>
You  ' ve the prediction in your mind when you do things .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#27:1>
That  ' d certainly affect your choice , and you find it reliable,'
argued Maggie .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#28:1>
'Anyway , I guess you seem to believe the foretelling more than my
words .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#29:1>
I  ' m going to dine with Esther tonight .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#30:1>
Come and join us? ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#31:1>
'I don't think so .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#32:1>
I  ' ve to meet Nick at Pokka Café at eight. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#33:1>
'Ok , have a romantic night then .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#34:1>
See you tomorrow. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#35:1>
'See you. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#36:1>
Left in the office were myself and <it> The Zodiac Master </it> ,
which lay , lively , on my writing desk. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#37:1>
NICK liked drinking coffee , black coffee in particular .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#38:1>
He said it kept him sober and wise .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#39:1>
How ridiculous he was , I thought .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#40:1>
Whenever he brought me to Pokka Café , I felt some cells of
resistance scurrying uneasily in my veins .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#41:1>
Every time we met , whether in Pokka Café or restaurants , he ordered
two cups of black coffee .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#42:1>
One for him and the other for me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#43:1>
He seemed to be unaware of my dislike of it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#44:1>
When I arrived at Pokka Café , as usual , it was muffled with an
odor of black coffee .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#45:1>
I was almost suffocated by the whiff .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#46:1>
Nick had arrived , sitting at the tiny table beside the window ,
which overlooked the traffic outside .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#47:1>
Somewhere near the crossroads was an accident , in which a car ran
into a tram. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#48:1>
Nick seemed overjoyed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#49:1>
I could tell from the triumphant grin that crossed his face and the
glistening sparkle in his eyes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#50:1>
'Darling , you look a wee bit tired. ' Nick kissed me on the
forehead. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#51:1>
'I  ' m sort of stressed out with my work.'

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#52:1>
The curse of  ' bad luck; was still perturbing me. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#53:1>
He waved the waiter and ordered two cups of black coffee without
asking me what I like to drink .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#54:1>
It had already become a ritual that made him feel masculine .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#55:1>
After the waiter had gone , he resumed the conversation ,  ' Sweetheart
, you know what ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#56:1>
I  ' ve been dispatched to work in the headquarters in New York. ' Nick
announced it in an elated tone .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#57:1>
He continued ,  ' Can you believe it ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#58:1>
I  ' m the only one who got this secondment! ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#59:1>
I was shocked .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#60:1>
Yet I tried to conceal my astonishment with calmness .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#61:1>
'Congratulations .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#62:1>
When will you go there? ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#63:1>
'Next month , the manager said. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#64:1>
'How long will it take? ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#65:1>
'Not sure .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#66:1>
Probably eight years. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#67:1>
Eight years ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#68:1>
It  ' s an incredibly long time .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#69:1>
How could that happen ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#70:1>
Is that what <it> The Zodiac Master </it> called the  ' bad luck'? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#71:1>
'You didn't turn down the offer , did you? ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#72:1>
'Of course not .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#73:1>
Why? ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#74:1>
'We  ' re just engaged .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#75:1>
You said you  ' ll marry me in two or three years .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#76:1>
This will certainly disrupt our plan . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#77:1>
I fidgeted. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#78:1>
'You mustn't worry , darling .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#79:1>
I  ' ve made a perfect plan already .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#80:1>
You go with me and then we could have our wedding ceremony in New
York. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#81:1>
'You  ' ve already made all of the arrangements? ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#82:1>
'Yes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#83:1>
Isn't it perfect? ' he said happily. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#84:1>
How about my feelings ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#85:1>
Have you ever thought of my feelings ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#86:1>
How about the promotion of the fireworks display ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#87:1>
How about my father if I go with you ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#88:1>
Words of unease were overwhelming my heard .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#89:1>
People said Scorpio was decisive .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#90:1>
Nick was Scorpio .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#91:1>
Was he trying to exert his control over me , over the dependent
Aquarius ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#92:1>
My blood was boiling hot in the veins .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#93:1>
But I was stuck , and could not utter a word. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#94:1>
'What  ' s wrong , darling ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#95:1>
What happened? ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#96:1>
The smell of black coffee drew near .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#97:1>
The waiter , with a tray in his hand , served the black coffees for
us .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#98:1>
I looked at the coffees , whispering in a desperate voice ,  ' Did you
ever know I don't like black coffee? ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#99:1>
Nick looked a bit unsure ,  ' Sorry? ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#100:1>
'I said I don't like black coffee. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#101:1>
He was taken aback ,  ' I - I thought you liked drinking it as I
do .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#102:1>
I thought - I thought you enjoyed drinking it whenever you were with
me. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#103:1>
'No .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#104:1>
I don't .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#105:1>
It  ' s you who like drinking black coffee .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#106:1>
It  ' s you who ordered black coffee for me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#107:1>
I  ' m forced to drink it , no matter how bitter it tastes. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#108:1>
'I  ' m sorry , darling .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#109:1>
I  ' m really sorry .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#110:1>
I promise you , I  ' ll never order black coffee for you , ok? ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#111:1>
'How about our future? ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#112:1>
'You can go to New York with me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#113:1>
Don't worry .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#114:1>
Everything will be fine, ' he assured me. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#115:1>
'You don't understand what I said.'

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#116:1>
I got sullen. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#117:1>
Nick looked down , without saying anything .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#118:1>
Both of us were kept in the deadlock of silence .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#119:1>
What am I doing now ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#120:1>
Am I rebelling against him ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#121:1>
Am I trying to overturn him ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#122:1>
I kept interrogating myself. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#123:1>
When I got up , he tried to kiss me but I withdrew .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#124:1>
Eventually , I left Pokka Café , without saying a word to him </p> .

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#125:1>
WHEN I got home , I was surrounded by intense darkness .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#126:1>
I turned on the light , and saw that my father was on the balcony .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#127:1>
I walked near him and called to him in a soft voice ,  ' Dad! ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#128:1>
'Sherry .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#129:1>
Look !

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#130:1>
Look at that star .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#131:1>
The most sparkling one above us.'

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#132:1>
My father was excited , pointing to the starry sky. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#133:1>
I looked up to the sky .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#134:1>
Thousands of stars were glittering , as if many eyes were watching
us .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#135:1>
Following my father  ' s direction , I discovered the star , the one
which was the most outstanding for its extra large size and shine. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#136:1>
'It must be the soul of your mother .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#137:1>
She must be sent to guide us..., ' my father muttered. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#138:1>
Dad must be very lonely after Mom died a year ago .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#139:1>
He kept thinking about her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#140:1>
Even now , he woke up early in the morning , sitting beside the
table , as it waiting for the breakfast that Mom used to prepare for us over
the years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#141:1>
'Dad, ' I drew near him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#142:1>
But I could not say anything. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#143:1>
He put his hand over my shoulder ,  ' Silly child .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#144:1>
We human beings are very stupid .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#145:1>
We  ' re always preoccupied with some trifling matters , which are not
worth mentioning when we die.'

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#146:1>
He seemed to have an ability to read my mind since my childhood .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#147:1>
'Dad, ' my eyes were welled with tears ,  ' I miss Mom .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#148:1>
I do miss her. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#149:1>
'Me too .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#150:1>
Your mom was such a determined person who influenced people around
her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#151:1>
Do you still remember Brownie? ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#152:1>
'Brownie ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#153:1>
A flash of memory seemed to revive in my brain .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#154:1>
I could not tell what exactly it was. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#155:1>
'Haha, ' my father gave a little laugh ,  ' you were too small to
remember that , I bet .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#156:1>
That year , you were around seven years old .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#157:1>
Your art teacher asked the whole class to stitch a teddy bear with
the brown cloth and cotton distributed in class .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#158:1>
Armed with the materials back home , you scattered the cloth and
cotton on the table and didn't get started .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#159:1>
Your mom sensed something happening and asked , &ldquo; My little
Sherry , aren't you supposed to stitch a bear ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#160:1>
Why don't you get started ? &rdquo; Your mom was a woman of a caring
heart .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#161:1>
Certainly her gentle concern moved you .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#162:1>
You replied , explaining that you thought it better to make a rabbit
instead of a bear .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#163:1>
But you said this would go against the teacher  ' s instruction and
didn't dare enough to do so .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#164:1>
Do you still remember what your mom said to you ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#165:1>
&ldquo; Just follow your will .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#166:1>
There  ' s not much difference between making a bear and a rabbit , as
long as you feel comfortable . &rdquo; Eventually you made a rabbit .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#167:1>
Brown rabbits are rare .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#168:1>
And you named your masterpiece Brownie .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#169:1>
Though Brownie didn't receive any praise from your art teacher , as
she questioned you why didn't you follow her instructions , you were happy
with it because you made it out of your consciousness. ' </p> Well done ,
Sherry .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#170:1>
See the little rabbit you stitched .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#171:1>
How cute it is .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#172:1>
Let  ' s give it a name - how about Brownie ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#173:1>
Doesn't that suit this little creature ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#174:1>
My mother was just standing beside me , stroking my hair with her
soft hand .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#175:1>
'Your mom was used to being that decisive .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#176:1>
She seemed not to take people  ' s advice .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#177:1>
Even I was no exception .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#178:1>
Somebody said she was wilful.'

<p> <it>

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#179:1>
Do whatever you think is good .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#180:1>
No matter what people say , follow your consciousness as long as you
feel comfortable. </it> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#181:1>
I walked to my bedroom and sat beside the dressing table .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#182:1>
Looking at the mirror , I saw my reflection .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#183:1>
I did not know myself completely , though I kept exploring the kind
of person I had been during the past years .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#184:1>
With a soft knock on the door , my father came in with a brown
affair in his hand .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#185:1>
He sat beside me and handed it to me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#186:1>
It was Brownie. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#187:1>
'Your mother kept it in her drawer for so many years .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#188:1>
She told me on her dying bed , &ldquo; Whenever Sherry is perplexed
, go and give Brownie to her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#189:1>
She will know what to do with it."'

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#190:1>
From his satisfied look , I knew my father was remembering my mother
again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#191:1>
It seemed to me that he had swallowed all her words and kept them in
a safe. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#192:1>
'Why did she withhold it for such a long time? ' I asked. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#193:1>
'When she was alive , she was your brownie .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#194:1>
She could give you advice whenever you felt confused .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#195:1>
But she knew that she would pass away someday , so she kept it ,
hoping it would guide you when she was no longer around .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#196:1>
And now , I give it to you .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#197:1>
I  ' m sure it  ' s already inhaled your mother  ' s spirit. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#198:1>
I held Brownie in my hand .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#199:1>
Stroking its worn-out surface , I sensed my mother  ' s
self-determination. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#200:1>
'SHERRY , I  ' m sorry for my gaffe at Pokka Caf&eacute; - I  ' m really
sorry for my mistake .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#201:1>
I was terrible .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#202:1>
Why don't you answer my call ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#203:1>
I miss you very much , darling .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#204:1>
I  ' m going to take the morning flight to New York tomorrow .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#205:1>
Nine o'clock in the morning .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#206:1>
Hope to see you at the airport .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#207:1>
Go with me , please .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#208:1>
I want to be with you .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#209:1>
Please forgive me.'

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#210:1>
I listened to the recorded snippet again and again , and could not
decide what I should do. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#211:1>
I could hear Nick imploring me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#212:1>
But how about my father ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#213:1>
The up-coming promotion ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#214:1>
I could not decide. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#215:1>
The next morning , I woke up with Brownie on my side .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#216:1>
It was seven .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#217:1>
I took the early ride to the airport .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#218:1>
When I arrived the airport was already thronged with people .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#219:1>
'Sherry! ' I heard a voice of delight yelling out from the herd of a
crowd .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#220:1>
It was Nick .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#221:1>
He ran towards me and held me tight in his arms. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#222:1>
'Sweetheart , I  ' m afraid I wouldn't see you again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#223:1>
I  ' m goddamn sorry for my mistake. ' He was excited .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#224:1>
He handed an air-ticket to me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#225:1>
'I knew you  ' d come .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#226:1>
And you did .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#227:1>
I knew you  ' d go with me.'

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#228:1>
He glanced around , asked ,  ' Where  ' s your luggage? ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#229:1>
'Nick , listen , I  ' m not going to New York .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#230:1>
I can't go with you. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#231:1>
'Why? ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#232:1>
'I can't leave my father .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#233:1>
I  ' ll miss him if I leave .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#234:1>
He  ' s so lonely and I don't want him to live for the years ahead
without any close relative around. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#235:1>
'Sherry.'

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#236:1>
Nick looked at me intensely ,  ' I love you , darling , I love you.'
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#237:1>
'I love you too .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#238:1>
But I won't feel good if I go with you .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#239:1>
I  ' m sorry. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#240:1>
'We could have a wedding in New York .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#241:1>
We could have children there .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#242:1>
I promise you .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#243:1>
I  ' ll take care of everything .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#244:1>
You can bring your father over too ,  '  Nick insisted. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#245:1>
'No - I know you  ' ve planned all the things .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#246:1>
I do appreciate that .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#247:1>
I want to be with you , but - I  ' m not going to New York at this
time .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#248:1>
Nick , you know , I used to take your decision over the years .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#249:1>
I want to take mine now .  '  </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-016#250:1>
Nick was subdued and could not say anything for a moment .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#251:1>
'Take care , sweetheart. ' I kissed him on the lips , and gradually
walked away from his fossilized body .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#252:1>
Walking in a big stride , I left the airport .

<ICE-HK:W2F-016#253:1>
What was left in the airport was <it> The Zodiac Master </it> ,
which was now buried in the garbage bin . </p>
