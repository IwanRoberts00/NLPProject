<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#17:1:B>
Uhm I think it  ' s quite okay

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#18:1:A>
Uh <{> <[> ha </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#19:1:B>
<[> Uh </[> </{> <,> but uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#20:1:B>
Have you heard of uhm <&> tut </&> old story that uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#21:1:B>
Actually uhm <,> in the past <,> everyone uh has another half

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#22:1:B>
That means they have uh two head two heads uh four hands and uhm
<,> <{1> <[1> four legs </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#23:1:B>
<{2> <[2> And </[2> then uhm they uhm how can I say

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#24:1:B>
They have uh a pairs actually they <{3> <[3> are </[3> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#25:1:B>
<{4> <[4> They are pairs </[4> yes being separated <{5> <[5> <,>
</[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#26:1:B>
So uhm nowadays uh the people need to find another half <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#27:1:B>
So if uh if the <,> if they are original

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#28:1:B>
If the <,> the original pair is uh two men

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#29:1:B>
Then uh he need to find another half that is a man

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#30:1:B>
<{6> <[6> If uh </[6> two girl then another half is a girl

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#31:1:B>
So uh I think it  ' s uh quite natural <&>

$B-laughs </&>

So you did it because your boyfriend wanted you to do it

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X78:1:Z>
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#79:1:A>
<{> <[> Right </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#80:1:B>
<[> Right </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#81:1:B>
Yes I just go there

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X82:1:Z>
Why you think your boyfriend wanted you to do it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#83:1:A>
<{> <[> I think </[> I think everybody are interested in sex

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#84:1:B>
<[> You think </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#85:1:B>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X86:1:Z>
Well if if they are

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X87:1:Z>
Then why you never hear much about it in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X88:1:Z>
Do you think people in Hong Kong are repressed </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#89:1:B>
<{1> <[1> Because </[1> most of the people think that uhm sex
is a taboo

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#90:1:B>
Uh they won't uh <,> they do not want to talk <{2> <[2> uh </[2>
openly

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#91:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#92:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X93:1:Z>
Uh ha </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#94:1:B>
And uh <,> so uh when you heard some uh sex jokes they would
laugh <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#95:1:B>
Because uhm uh actually they want to express this

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#96:1:B>
But uh but they think that it is a taboo so uh they <,> just uh use
another way

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#97:1:B>
<{2> <[2> To use the </[2> sex jokes to express <,> the feeling

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X98:1:Z>
<[1> Uh ha </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X99:1:Z>
<[2> I see </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X100:1:Z>
Or or so why do you think that is

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X101:1:Z>
Why why is it so

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X102:1:Z>
Because it  ' s <,> quite normal for people to talk about sex in
western countries </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#103:1:B>
Yes I think it  ' s <,> the <{1> <[1> culture </[1> <,> <{2>
<[2> yeah </[2>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#104:1:A>
<[1> People of </[1> </{1> culture

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#105:1:A>
<[2> Different </[2> </{2> culture

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X106:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X107:1:Z>
Have you every talked to your parents about sex </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#108:1:A>
We won't talk to <,> <{> <[> our parents </[> about sex

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#109:1:B>
<[> We won't </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X110:1:Z>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#111:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#112:1:A>
I think uh it  ' s a taboo between uh parents and children to
talk about <{1> <[1> sex in China </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#113:1:A>
<{2> <[2> In in <.> Chi </.> </[2> I mean <{3> <[3> I </[3> mean

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#126:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#131:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#132:1:A>
We just have some idea

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#133:1:A>
Maybe uh we get we get <{> <[> this idea </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X134:1:Z>
<[> You know anything </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X135:1:Z>
You didn't know anything about sex at all until you were <{> <[>
fifteen or sixteen </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#136:1:A>
<[> We didn't <,> we </[> </{> didn't know much

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#137:1:A>
Because uh in <,> in Chinese <{> <[> culture </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X138:1:Z>
<[> Know </[> </{> what  ' s sex was before you were fifteen or
sixteen </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#139:1:A>
Just very little

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#140:1:A>
May maybe we can uh have some information in those magazines

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#141:1:A>
<{1> <[1> And we  ' ll </[1> read the magazines and some people uh
send the questions to the editor

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#142:1:A>
To arc ask the question about sex <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#143:1:A>
And we  ' ll just read it and <,> in some uh teenage magazines

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#144:1:A>
Uh so we get some idea about it

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#145:1:A>
But for uh very uh precise details of uh how to have a baby or
<{3> <[3> whatever </[3> we don't know

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#146:1:A>
Until we take the Biology lessons

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X147:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X155:1:Z>
Uh when I was seven </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#156:1:B>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X157:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#158:1:A>
How did you know it

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X159:1:Z>
I ask my parents </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#160:1:B>
<{> <[> Uh </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#161:1:A>
<[> And </[> </{> your parents respond to you very naturally

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X162:1:Z>
They told me exactly what happen </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#163:1:B>
Uh <{> <[> ha </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#164:1:A>
<[> Uh </[> </{> <{> <[> ha </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X165:1:Z>
<[> And </[> </{> then show me some books

And then say that <{> <[> if I </[> was interested I can go up to
the library and take out some more books

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X167:1:Z>
So I did </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#168:1:B>
<[> Uh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#170:1:B>
I see

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#171:1:A>
But our parents won't do that <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#172:1:A>
They just they just say <unc> one-word </unc> it  ' s not uh
suitable for children to know about <{2> <[2> it </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#173:1:A>
Just forget it when you grow up you  ' ll know

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#174:1:B>

role yeah </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#179:1:A>
It  ' s influencing people  ' s idea on sex

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#180:1:A>
maybe uh some people think uh sex is dirty and sex is just uhm <,>
an issue for adults

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#181:1:B>
<[> Important role yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#182:1:B>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#185:1:A>
It depends on who I  ' m talking <{> <[> I  ' m </[> who I  ' m

And actually <,> woman are able to procreate are able to have
children before boys are

<[2> sexually faster </[2> than boys

Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#237:1:B>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X238:1:Z>
Why aren't girls interested in it

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X239:1:Z>
Because girls are interested in it in other countries </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#240:1:B>
I think uh girls are more passive and more shy so uh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X241:1:Z>
Not necessary </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#242:1:B>
I don't know because uhm <,> I study in a girl  ' s school <{>
<[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#243:1:B>
And uhm <,> I think uhm <,> most of our classmates uh do not talk
about this topic

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X244:1:Z>
<[> Uh ha </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X245:1:Z>
So why do you want a boyfriend then </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#246:1:B>

Why why do you want a boyfriend <&>

$B-laughs </&> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#248:1:B>
I don't know

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X249:1:Z>
What  ' s what  ' s the purpose of that

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X250:1:Z>
What  ' s the purpose of having a boyfriend </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#251:1:A>
I think there is no purpose

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#252:1:A>
You just like the guy and then <,> just <{1> <[1> get along <,>
</[1> <{2> <[2> that </[2> is

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#253:1:B>
<[1> Yeah choose him </[1> </{1>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X254:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X255:1:Z>
But what  ' s the result

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X256:1:Z>
Are you supposed to <,> uh you get married or what </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#257:1:B>
Yeah <{> <[> so <unc> one-word </unc> </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X258:1:Z>
<[> So you automatically </[> </{> think about as soon as you
have a boyfriend

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X259:1:Z>
You automatically assume that you gone to get married to that
person

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X260:1:Z>
Is that what <{> <[> you think </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#261:1:B>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#262:1:B>
Yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X263:1:Z>
So you never think about <,> just going out with different people
to <,> find out <,> who you like the most or <,> to experimental to do
anything like that </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#264:1:B>
No I just uh I think uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#265:1:B>
If I choose him then I uh uhm <,> I will play a very very <&>

$B-laughs </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#266:1:A>
You will be very loyal <{1> <[1> to him </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#267:1:A>
<{2> <[2> Yeah </[2>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#268:1:B>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X269:1:Z>
<[2> But </[2> </{2> there are so many different people in the
world

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X270:1:Z>
How do you know that you chosen a right person </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#271:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#272:1:B>
But I think it  ' s a kind of responsibility for us to loyal <,> to
our lover

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X273:1:Z>
If you what if you find somebody else that you like

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X274:1:Z>
Well it depends what you mean by lover as well

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X275:1:Z>
But you know what lover is </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#276:1:B>
<{> <[> Yeah </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#277:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X278:1:Z>
Not someone that you go to the movies with

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X279:1:Z>
But somebody who <{1> <[1> share </[1> <unc> one-word
</unc> <{2> <[2> okay </[2> </X>

<$A> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#280:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#281:1:B>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2> yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X282:1:Z>
Okay that  ' s one

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X283:1:Z>
So we can differentiate between boyfriend lover husbands

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X284:1:Z>
<{> <[> Oh </[> different categories obviously

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X285:1:Z>
But then <,> how do you know that the first choice that you make

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X286:1:Z>
A little girl who who only learn about sex in high school when
she was fifteen or sixteen

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X287:1:Z>
And God gets her <?> frog </?> first boyfriend when she  ' s
eighteen or nineteen

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X288:1:Z>
And she decides <,> this is the only man in her life who she
should go to get marry and spend the rest of her life with

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X289:1:Z>
How do you know that it  ' s the right choice when you have so
little experience </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#290:1:A>
<[> Uh ha </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#291:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#292:1:A>
I think it  ' s difficult to know

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#293:1:A>
Time <{> <[> proves </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X294:1:Z>
<[> I  ' m </[> </{> not say whether <{1> <[1> it  ' s </[1> right or
wrong

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X295:1:Z>
I  ' m just want to know why <{2> <[2> how </[2> <{3> <[3> how
</[3> makes you <{4> <[4> so </[4> certain </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#296:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#297:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#298:1:B>
<[3> Argue </[3> </{3>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#299:1:A>
<[4> Yeah </[4> </{4>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#300:1:B>
Uhm <,,> I think uh through uhm <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#301:1:B>
Maybe uhm time can prove

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#302:1:B>
Because uhm sometimes uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#303:1:B>
Actually uhm <,> uh I have uh I have three boyfriends in the past
<{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#304:1:B>
<{2> <[2> And uh </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X305:1:Z>
<[1> Uh ha </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X306:1:Z>
<[2> I can so </[2> </{2> see how  ' s your first boyfriend </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#307:1:B>
Uh no <{1> <[1> the </[1> first one

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#308:1:B>
Uhm for the first one I think that uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#309:1:B>
Uh our characters are very different

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#310:1:B>
<{2> <[2> We </[2> have a different point of view

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#311:1:B>
<{3> <[3> So </[3> I think that uhm <,> he cannot be the one

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#312:1:B>
Uh he should not be the one that uhm I will be marry <{4> <[4> <,>
</[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#313:1:B>
And uh for the second one because uhm <,> uh he  ' s not a loyal
person <&>

$B-laughs </&> <{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#314:1:B>
He goes together with another girl <{6> <[6> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#315:1:B>
So </[6> uhm <,> I uh uhm break our relationship <{7> <[7> <,>
</[7> with him

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#316:1:B>
And now it  ' s the third one

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#317:1:B>
Uhm <,> up till now I think it  ' s quite okay

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#318:1:B>
Because uhm <,> we have uhm <,> same interest <{8> <[8> same </[8>
hobbies and uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#319:1:B>
We have a same religion and uhm <,> I think uh he treats me very
well <{9> <[9> <,> </[9>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#320:1:B>
So uh I hope he will be my husband but I I don't know either

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X321:1:Z>
<[1> Okay </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X322:1:Z>
<[2> Uh ha </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X323:1:Z>
<[3> Uh </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X324:1:Z>
<[4> Uh ha </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X325:1:Z>
<[5> Uh ha </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X326:1:Z>
<[6> I see </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X327:1:Z>
<[7> Uh ha </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X328:1:Z>
<[8> Uhm uhm </[8> </{8>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X329:1:Z>
<[9> Uh ha </[9> </{9>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X330:1:Z>
So that  ' s what you think about when go out with somebody how

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X331:1:Z>
You don't actually think about <,> I want to go out with a boy
because I like him

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X332:1:Z>
You think about I  ' m looking for a <,> a future husband </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#333:1:B>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X334:1:Z>
Really </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#335:1:B>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X336:1:Z>
So when you look at a boy

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X337:1:Z>
You think <,> I wonder he may a good husband

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X338:1:Z>
You don't think I wonder he may a good boyfriend or if he he
would be friends

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X339:1:Z>
But you actually thinking about whether he could be a good
husband </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#340:1:B>
Uh

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#341:1:A>
I think if you get along with a guy for a period of time

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#342:1:A>
You will think about it whether uh he will be my husband or not

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#343:1:A>
<{> <[> But </[> at <,> very first moment you  ' ll just treat him
as a boyfriend

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#344:1:B>
<[> Wow </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#345:1:B>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X346:1:Z>
The rest of your life is quite a long period of time <&>

$B-laughs </&> <,> isn't it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#347:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X348:1:Z>
Especially when you are only twenty two </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#349:1:A>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X350:1:Z>
Forty years fifty years sixty

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X351:1:Z>
Long time </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#352:1:A>
For period of time I mean uh maybe two two or one or two
years

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X353:1:Z>
Uh ha </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#354:1:A>
Because uh time can prove a <.> per </.> how a person is

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X355:1:Z>
You  ' re looking for change over time as well </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#356:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#357:1:B>
So uh after uh after first sight or after the uhm some

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#358:1:B>
I don't know how to say

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#359:1:B>
The <,> just uhm the relationship are just uh go out or just uhm
go shopping

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#360:1:B>
Or just uh go to watch a movie <{1> <[1> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#361:1:B>
And </[1> then you should <,> uhm develop a relationship

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#362:1:B>
That means uhm <,> this is not only love but also responsibility
<{2> <[2> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#363:1:B>
That </[2> means you are loyal to this one to the person <,> that
uhm yeah get along to

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#364:1:B>
And uhm <&>

$B-laughs </&> <,> do you know what I mean

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X365:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X366:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X367:1:Z>
I know what you mean </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#368:1:B>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#369:1:B>
So I think I  ' m <,> after the first sight

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#370:1:B>
And uh after you have uh <,> uh go with this person

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#371:1:B>
You need to develop a a relationship

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#372:1:B>
To uh develop a responsibility <,> to that guy

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X373:1:Z>
Uh ha </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#374:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#375:1:B>
So that uh if he uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#376:1:B>
He maybe change but uh <,> you have to uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#377:1:B>
Maybe you have to change either

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X378:1:Z>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#398:1:A>
You mean after thirty I think

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X399:1:Z>
After </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#400:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#401:1:B>
Just around thirty <{1> <[1> something </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#402:1:B>
Because uh <,> uh <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#403:1:B>
Because after <.> marr </.> uh because after marriage uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#404:1:B>
Maybe I want to have a baby

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#405:1:B>
<{2> <[2> So </[2> uh if uh <&>

$B-laughs </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X406:1:Z>
<[1> Why </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X407:1:Z>
<[2> Uh ha </[2> </{2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#408:1:A>
If you are too old <[> then </[> it will be very dangerous

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#409:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#410:1:B>
Yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X411:1:Z>
Yeah but actually you can do that right after the age of forty or
or or older <{> <[> nowadays </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#412:1:B>
<[> I know </[> </{> that

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#413:1:B>
But uhm <,> if you have a a baby then you will have a

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#414:1:B>
If you are too too old to have a baby then you will have a <.> gen
</.> generation gap

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X415:1:Z>
A generation <{> <[> gap </[> </X>

<$B> <[> Yeah </[> </{> <&>

$B-laughs </&> between the children

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X416:1:Z>
I don't believe that

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X417:1:Z>
I think maybe that  ' s a good point

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X418:1:Z>
I think that children get along with their grandparents better
than they get along with their parents sometimes

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X419:1:Z>
<{1> <[1> Because </[1> there isn't generation gap <&>

$B-laughs </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X420:1:Z>
What are my <{2> <[2> own experience </[2> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#421:1:B>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#422:1:B>
<[2> Uh yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#423:1:B>
I don't know but uhm maybe uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#424:1:B>
If the parents too old then they will not have <,> energy <,> to
uh take care of their children

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X425:1:Z>
Sure but they have more experience

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X426:1:Z>
So they know how better to look after them </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#427:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#428:1:A>
Yeah I agree

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#429:1:B>
<{> <[> Yeah I agree </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X430:1:Z>
<[> What are may be </[> </{> more establish their career and
have more money to look after them </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#431:1:B>
Yes <&>

$B-laughs </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X432:1:Z>
So if you feel rush

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X433:1:Z>
What about yourself

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X434:1:Z>
I mean what what about what the things are you want to do in your
own life </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#435:1:B>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X436:1:Z>
Don't you have any things that you want to do

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X437:1:Z>
Don't you want to travel or <,> other <,> things that you like to
experience to yourself

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X438:1:Z>
After all you got your own mind as well </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#439:1:B>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#440:1:B>
Uhm

Yeah

<$A>

Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#444:1:A>
But it  ' s difficult to find jobs in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#445:1:A>
If I if you  ' re not <,> <.> par </.> uh particularly good in

If you don't know any <.> anyb </.> anyone who is working in uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#448:1:A>
It  ' s difficult to find a job in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#449:1:A>

What sort of job you want to do </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#459:1:A>
Uhm I don't know

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#460:1:A>
Some maybe some jobs are <,> work

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#461:1:A>
Maybe working about people instead of working with paper works

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#462:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#463:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#464:1:A>
Because <{> <[> uhm </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X465:1:Z>
<[> Have </[> </{> you decided yet of what you  ' re going to do
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#466:1:A>
I  ' m not decided

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#467:1:A>
Uh because uh <,> for our field of study uh the choices are very
limited

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#468:1:A>
Uh in those we are <{1> <[1> we are </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#469:1:A>
Uh I  ' m studying English and French <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and uh the
field uh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X470:1:Z>
<[1> What  ' s study </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X471:1:Z>
<[2> Uh ha </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X472:1:Z>
It shouldn't be limited

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X473:1:Z>
I mean it  ' s quite easy to get a job if you speak English Chinese
<{> <[> and French </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#474:1:A>
<[> No because </[> </{> uh <,> if those jobs that we can do

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#475:1:A>
That means everybody can do that <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#476:1:A>
Because uh if those jobs we apply is open to any discipline

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#477:1:A>
And many people will complete with us and it  ' s very competitive

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#478:1:A>
<{2> <[2> Yeah </[2>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#479:1:B>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X480:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2> but actually in Hong Kong there aren't many
people who speaks good English </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#481:1:A>
I don't speak any I don't speak good English either even
though I  ' m taking a major in English <&>

<$A> and

<$B> laugh </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#482:1:B>
You know whether you are majoring in that subject or not

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#483:1:B>
It <{> <[> it doesn't mean it doesn't mean </[> you  ' ll speak you  ' ll
do uh particularly good in that aspect

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#484:1:B>
<[> It doesn't matter <,> yeah </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X485:1:Z>
I know </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#486:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X487:1:Z>
I just graduated <,> in Chinese <&>

<$A> and

<$B> laugh </&> <,> I </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#488:1:A>
But it  ' s different but it  ' s different

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#489:1:A>
Because <{1> <[1> uh we  ' re </[1> we  ' ve we  ' ve been educated in
English for so many years

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#490:1:A>
And it  ' s it is supposed that uh we must have speak good English
<{2> <[2> it </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#491:1:A>
Especially we are uh an university graduate <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>
but uh in <.> rea </.> in <.> re </.> in reality it  ' s not case

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#492:1:B>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#493:1:B>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X494:1:Z>
<[3> Uh ha </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X495:1:Z>
Why do you think that is </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#496:1:A>
Pardon

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X497:1:Z>
Why why </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#498:1:B>
Uh because we do not have <{> <[> <,> </[> practice

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#499:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#500:1:A>
<{> <[> Yeah </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X501:1:Z>
<[> Uh </[> </{> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#502:1:A>
And we do not have enough enough practices

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#503:1:A>
We just uh speak English in those tutorial classes

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#504:1:A>
<{1> <[1> And </[1> uh <,> we are spend most time on listening
rather than speaking

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#505:1:A>
I think <{2> <[2> uh speaking </[2> is very important to learn a
new language

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#506:1:B>
<[1> And </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#507:1:B>
<[2> Yeah </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X508:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X509:1:Z>
<{> <[> Uh ha </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-077#510:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#511:1:B>
And uh we just uh maybe in our daily life conversation

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#512:1:B>
We use Cantonese <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> rather than English

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#513:1:B>
So uhm <,> uh we do not have any chances

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#514:1:B>
Just uh <{2> <[2> maybe </[2> uh listen to the lecturer or gives
uh some comments <,> that  ' s all

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#515:1:B>
So uhm <,> for those uh who are studying uhm in other maybe
majoring in other subjects

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#516:1:B>
Then they find that uh <,> for them oral English really a big
problem for them uhm to have a interview <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> when they are
<,> for uh when they are interview for the job application

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-077#X517:1:Z>
