<ICE-HK:S2A-030#83:1:A>
And the itinerary what we gonna do today will be visit the Hong
Kong Island

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#84:1:A>
This tour will certainly give you a general idea what the Hong Kong
is uh look like <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#85:1:A>
and uh first we gonna go up to the Victoria Peak which is the
situate one thousand three hundred feet above the sea level

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#86:1:A>
Once we get up to the top of the mountain we will have a chance to
see the beautiful harbour and Hong Kong Island as well as the Kowloon
Peninsula

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#87:1:A>
Once we get up there I like to point out where  ' s our new airport
will be

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#88:1:A>
As you know there  ' s uh we  ' ve been having a very heavy controversy
between England and China regarding our new airport

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#89:1:A>
I don't matter how <,> uh how bad they were going on to argue each
others <,> but our new airport will be completed in nineteen ninety-seven
because we need it <,> very much urgently

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#90:1:A>
So up to the ways give you I give you a briefing <,> on the top of
the mountains and then we  ' ll be going all the way down to the place where the
the ladies can do a little bargaining and shopping called the Stanley market

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#91:1:A>
And the gentlemen if it  ' s not they don't feel like doing some
shopping

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#92:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#93:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#94:1:A>
That is a deal

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#95:1:A>
And after the Stanley market we  ' ll be driving along the borderfront
area where we can see the beautiful Deep Water Bay and Repulse Bay

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#96:1:A>
And those are considered the most popular <,> uh beaches on the
island <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#97:1:A>
And from there we will make a stop over at the local point right by
near Repulse Bay people <unc> 1 WORD </unc> have a <,> nice pictures
over of over the bay areas

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#98:1:A>
And after the Repulse Bay we  ' ll be driving all the way down to the
colourful fishing village <,> which is which is called the Aberdeen

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#99:1:A>
Aberdeen is is a is a way of going back to over hundred years of
histories <,> and imagine before Hong Kong become the such an international
cities

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#100:1:A>
that  ' s what the Hong Kong used to be look like <,> hundred years
ago

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#101:1:A>
It used to be just a fishing village <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#102:1:A>
There were five thousand people living in the ocean and pretty
well remained the cultural and living style as well as a language

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#103:1:A>
They still speak in their own language among the own communities
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#104:1:A>
So today we will drive down there and you can have a chance to
experience how peoples still living in the such a primitive way in the modern
cities of Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#105:1:A>
And after the colourful start we  ' ll be driving through the
industry site

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#106:1:A>
Today we  ' re just making a brief stop over at the <.> go </.> gold
<,> factories where they they design and making all those beautiful Chinese
gold articles in the western and oriental Chinese design

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#107:1:A>

Chinese ladies <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#108:1:A>

free to ask me <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#110:1:A>
and I will try my best to answer everyone of you

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#111:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#112:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#113:1:A>
Once you folks probably don't know the differences <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#114:1:A>
Having a stickers on you just remember that and uh once you
disappear at least I can easier for me to find you because I still have a
difficult time <,> to identify every one of you once <,> you uh look the same
to me <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#115:1:A>

In the early morning and at at night will be cooler <,> in the
afternoon will be nice

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#119:1:A>
That  ' s why <,> we always recommend people to go on a tour in the
mornings <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#120:1:A>
The area we are driving through now this is called the Causeway
Bay district

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#121:1:A>
This is the main horde of the shopping centre on Hong Kong Island
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#122:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#131:1:A>

That  ' s why and it  ' s not like back home in your countries you
prepare your lunch and and and <,> before you go to work <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#133:1:A>
but right here because with the such a competitive of the timings

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#159:1:A>
Very popular among the Indian <,> people

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#160:1:A>
Right behind this is a cemetery <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#161:1:A>
Actually the cemetery just across the street from the <,> from the
racetrack <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#162:1:A>
Before people entering into the racetrack the first thing they see
is a <,> cemetery <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#163:1:A>
Now we are slowly driving all the way up to the top of the
mountains

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#164:1:A>
The highest point we gonna go today <,> will be a one thousand
three hundred feet <,> above the sea level <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#165:1:A>
With the public transportation to get up to the Victoria Peak <,>
you can take the double decker bus <,> or there  ' s a peak tram will be
available <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#166:1:A>
The tram stations situate in the central areas <,> which is just
across the street from the American Consulate <,> and close by the Hilton
Hotel in Central <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#167:1:A>
Look at all those cars in line <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#168:1:A>
Lot of them are beautiful cars are they <,> lots of Mercedes <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#169:1:A>
That indicate the people living on the top of the mountain are
mostly are high rank <,> government servants <,> or executive of large
companies <,> or tour guides sooner or later

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#170:1:A>
To rent the apartments on the top of the peak <,> it cost
approximately a thirty thousand Hong Kong dollars <,> a month <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#171:1:A>
In terms of American dollars or English pounds which is uh three
thousand pounds or four thousand US dollars <,> a month

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#172:1:A>
Most apartments or house paid by the government or by the company
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#173:1:A>
With the buildings on the left <,> most of them are <,> private
apartments <,> and some of them thirty to forty storeys high are quite a
height <,> and were build along the mountain side

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#174:1:A>
Look at the green tiled roof building the big mash

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#175:1:A>
This is the uh headquarter of the Hong Kong Royal Jockey Club <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#176:1:A>
You may concern about all these high rises sitting on the mountain
sides <,> if we have a earthquake <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#177:1:A>
But we are fortunate <,> Hong Kong is not situate in the
earthquake area

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#178:1:A>
But we have a very nasty typhoon <,> coming couple times a years

<ICE-HK:S2A-030#179:1:A>
All those buildings are pretty well build resist the typhoon <,>
