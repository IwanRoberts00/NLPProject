<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-065#1:1:A>
Members of the jury <,> I am counsel for the Second Defendant
in this case

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#2:1:A>
And the reason why I  ' m submitting to you now it  ' s because since my
client Second Defendant is said that to be the principle offender in the rape
matter

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#3:1:A>
Uh it  ' s it  ' s resolved that it  ' s probably better that I should
address you all first before my learned friend for prosecution

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#4:1:A>
Basically uhm as you no doubt where by now that my client discharged
on the indictment with four counts

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#5:1:A>
First is called the robbery count which should be pleaded and than
the rape the attempted rape and of course the indecent assault

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#6:1:A>
Before I go into other aspect of the evidence perhaps I should
remind you first of all that you should consider each count separately

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#7:1:A>
Now the evidence pertaining to one count may not be relevant in so
far as the other count is concerned

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#8:1:A>
So it  ' s important that you better define that you consider each
count with the evidence pertaining to each and then you move on from first
the first one and then to the second and third

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#9:1:A>
Second reminder is you consider the case against each of the
Defendant separately because the allegations against each of them are not
necessarily the same

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#10:1:A>
Perhaps it  ' d be convenient for me to group these four offences
into two category

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#11:1:A>
First is robbery

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#12:1:A>
Second category is the sexual offences

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#13:1:A>
You have been told and no doubt you will be uh uhm directed in due
course by his Lordship about the burden of proof

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#14:1:A>
My friend have already addressed you on that

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#15:1:A>
Basically it  ' s very simple

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#16:1:A>
You just have to be sure having heard the evidence and consider the
evidence you have to be sure uh that you are are are are to the extent that
you for sure that these Defendant had committed the offence

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#17:1:A>
But <,> in layman term it it means simply this as far as we are
concerned as far as defence is concerned all defence is concerned what we are
saying is you make the allegation <,> great allegations and it  ' s for you to
prove that the case stands

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#18:1:A>
And of course one has to decide and look at the evidence <,> <&>
tape stops and restarts </&> come to any of uhm <,> especially the robbery
count <,> the evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#19:1:A>
You heard the evidence of the victim

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#20:1:A>
Not only that you have the evidence you know you heard the evidence
<,> of the items found on for the for these events

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#21:1:A>
So that  ' s included <,> case as far as the robbery is concerned

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#22:1:A>
But of course you are now <,> and will be now more concerned about
the sexual offences

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#23:1:A>
Likewise you look at the allegations and you also look at other
supporting evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#24:1:A>
Basically the allegations of rape comes from Madam Lam the victim

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#25:1:A>
In fact her evidence is the only evidence in front of you <,> about
rape

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#26:1:A>
You see members of the jury this is what I called <,> a bare
allegation type of case with nothing else to support

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#27:1:A>
Her evidence she gave you her recollection of the event in so far
as the rape is concerned

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#28:1:A>
She  ' ve told you uh how she had been gagged and tied up

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#29:1:A>
And how she was raped

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#30:1:A>
And immediately after the rape what had happened

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#31:1:A>
The police came in and then she washed herself

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#32:1:A>
But even if you take her evidence as it stand without proceeding
further into considering other aspect of the case you will find that in so
far as her claimed that she had been gagged and tied up uhm appeared that
that is not support by evidence uh by the medical evidence to the extent that
there as no injuries are found

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#33:1:A>
She  ' s given you the explanations

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#34:1:A>
She  ' s <.> giv </.> she  ' s told you uh uh why that <.> m </.> may
be the counsel has said that there  ' s no injuries

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#35:1:A>
As a matter for you to decide

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#36:1:A>
My respect submission is a doubtful area that <,> she <.> sh </.>
initially told you in court that she had resisted

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#37:1:A>
So one would expect obviously uh injures but of course later on she
changed

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#38:1:A>
Later on she changed her evidence and then she told you I I wanted
to resist but of course I didn't resist so it  ' s it  ' s something that you uh
you will take into consideration

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#39:1:A>
And something which my respect submission is ought <,> my
contention that her evidence at least in so far as that aspect is concerned
is doubtful

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#40:1:A>
And uh she claimed that she had washed herself

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#41:1:A>
Uh members of the jury you will <,> be very very cautions and
placed particular importance on this aspect of the evidence that she washed
herself because I  ' m turns on whether or not she had washed herself

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#42:1:A>
<.> Ba </.> especially if you matched that with the evidence of the
doctor and obviously the evidence of Doctor Betty Law you can able to use and
<,> well had she washed herself

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#43:1:A>
Well is another doubtful area

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#44:1:A>
She told us that she had she described to you <,> it appears quite
clearly at what stage of that particular incident that she had gone to the
toilet and washed herself

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#45:1:A>
And she told you that it was a thorough wash

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#46:1:A>
That evidence with respect is not supported by any of the other
evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#47:1:A>
Now police evidence is is contrary to that

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#48:1:A>
Uhm <,> at least in so far as that aspect of the evidence is
concerned the police is totally neutral

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#49:1:A>
Well they uh uhm have nothing to claim

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#50:1:A>
They say as far as their recollection <,> go uh they don't remember
Madam Lam having gone to any other part of the premises apart from in the
living room and the area behind the curtain

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#51:1:A>
Police been asked Inspector Cheung at least being asked many many
times about that

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#52:1:A>
And every time he come back with a firm answer no <,> that she had
not

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#53:1:A>
So you can you can take it from his evidence that it  ' s more likely
or not that she had not been you know what had washed herself

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#54:1:A>
And if you agree with me on that then what we have left is a rape
<,> uhm with the Defendant having penetrated her and ejaculated uh with no
washing

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#55:1:A>
Hours later she was sent uh to be medically examined

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#56:1:A>
In fact in so far as Doctor Wong  ' s examination is concerned it  ' s
within one to two hours that she was uh in front of Doctor Wong who examined
her apart from physical side uhm uh of of it

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#57:1:A>
Uh you  ' ll remember that Doctor Wong confirmed and told us that
there is no evidence to show sexual intercourse

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#58:1:A>
Again qualification is as far as Doctor Wong is concerned that she
had washed herself

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#59:1:A>
And <,> I  ' ve already told you what weight <?> Defendant will be
</?> placed on the evidence about having washed herself

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#60:1:A>
So that <,> basically is is the evidence of uhm of Madam Lam

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#61:1:A>
In itself is doubtful for recent charges submitted to you

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#62:1:A>
But if you match that against the evidence other available evidence
you will hopefully come to a finding that it  ' s it  ' s probably the case that
there was no sexual intercourse because if there had not been a sexual
intercourse the offence of rape is not proven

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#63:1:A>
It  ' s simple as that

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#64:1:A>
You look at the evidence of uhm <,> Doctor Law

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#65:1:A>
You see members of the jury as laymen <,> if if someone would say
to you about an allegation like this and you  ' re asked to think and you ask
to to look at the evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#66:1:A>
One of the things that you might say to yourself is <,> well well
let  ' s have a look at the uhm the under pant you know I mean is there any
presence of semen there

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#67:1:A>
It  ' s been said that in fact that no semen well is <.> de </.>
detected uh is proved that there was no sexual intercourse

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#68:1:A>
But members of the jury it  ' s really a very common sense approach
to this

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#69:1:A>
You can't make an allegation of sexual intercourse and then not
back it up with evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#70:1:A>
You just can't do this

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#71:1:A>
That the two vital pieces of evidence as far as <,> the issue of
sexual intercourse is concerned would be an examination of the penile or or
the vagina  ' s swabs

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#72:1:A>
And obviously an examination on the under pants

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#73:1:A>
Now the evidence is not there

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#74:1:A>
Why

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#75:1:A>
Doctor Law has given you the explanation

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#76:1:A>
Members of the jury <,> uhm I hate to say this but this is a case
of negligence as far as she is concerned

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#77:1:A>
I don't want to attach too much blame

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#78:1:A>
May be she says a lot of work that she has overlooked but the fact
remains that the two vital pieces of evidence which would assist you in the
the determination of this very vital issue is simply not there

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#79:1:A>
The Crown Mr Suffiad mentioned to you <,> that much hinges on the
evidence <,> of Madam Lam

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#80:1:A>
But unfortunately of course we have the lost evidence of of of
semen because she had washed herself

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#81:1:A>
And likewise lost evidence when he comes to the forensic evidence
<unc> a few words </unc> <&> tape stops and restarts </&> <?> wrongly
</?> but facts remains that simply not there

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#82:1:A>
That would it be as my learned friend has said the existence of
such evidence would it been <,> final as far as the charge of rape is
concerned because as he put it <unc> four words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#83:1:A>
But we don't have such now

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#84:1:A>
And yet you were asked to convict nevertheless even in the absence
of that

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#85:1:A>
So basically you will ask to convict and return the guilty verdict
on the allegation of one person <,> Madam Lam

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#86:1:A>
Just that and nothing

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#87:1:A>
Now my comment as far as Madam Lam is concerned is she is a
reluctant witness

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#88:1:A>
She is prepared to make allegations

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#89:1:A>
And stick to allegations but she is not prepared or able to give us
details to back up those allegations

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#90:1:A>
Now it  ' s important that we know surrounding circumstances

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#91:1:A>
Because otherwise how can you safely come to a conclusion that you
can rely on her evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#92:1:A>
One doesn't know why she  ' s like this

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#93:1:A>
May be she doesn't like the whole atmosphere all right

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#94:1:A>
May be she has a perfectly valid reason uh uh not to to have told
us everything or may be she really just cannot remember because the long
lapse of time

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#95:1:A>
Obviously I have not doubted on the of lapse of of you know bad
memories because of the long lapse of time

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#96:1:A>
But really doesn't matter what reason she gave

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#97:1:A>
Doesn't matter whether the reasons are valid or not valid

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#98:1:A>
The fact remained that there is no other evidence that she is
reluctant and it makes it impossible for you to say that she is a hundred
percent truthful witness

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#99:1:A>
It  ' s said that she has no extra ground

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#100:1:A>
Well I don't know about that

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#101:1:A>
She was wrong

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#102:1:A>
Her money part of her money <,> is is taken from her

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#103:1:A>
Every reason for her to exaggerate her evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#104:1:A>
It  ' s the motive to put to put in

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#105:1:A>
One simply cannot rule out the possibility of an aggrieved person
wanting to make extra accusation

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#106:1:A>
Initially police arrived it was robbery

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#107:1:A>
Only after that you calculate well you make of the evidence is
there how you make of it  ' s reasons

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#108:1:A>
But overall <,> this is <,> a bad case as far as the prosecution
is concerned on the rape

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#109:1:A>
Because the evidence <,> is totally bad

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#110:1:A>
And then brings me to <,> perhaps the other two counts which my
clients also indicted that is the indecent assault and the attempted rape

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#111:1:A>
Now I won't say very much because the case against uhm my client
Law Wai Man is that he he gave assistance all right

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#112:1:A>
He didn't actually uh he wasn't the the actual person who actually
attempted the rape uh or indecently assaulted

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#113:1:A>
But since he  ' s charged as an accomplice as the person in the
joint enterprise uhm that I should say a few words

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#114:1:A>
But of course uh so far as those two counsels and counsels for D
one and D two with no doubt will give you a <unc> three words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#115:1:A>
Now as far as that is concerned all I would say is <,> basically
the position is the same as the rape

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#116:1:A>
Because you are still asked to bring in a verdict of guilty on the
evidence of Madam Lam alone and there is nothing

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#117:1:A>
Nothing

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#118:1:A>
Now just to round off my submission <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#119:1:A>
My learned friend said to you that uhm Lord that I will correct it
if I  ' m wrong on this but it appeared that my understating my <.> le </.>
learned friend said to you that the Second Defendant through me has sort of
raised the defence at your rest

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#120:1:A>
Basically the defence at your rest is one is is forced to to
commit a crime that is to rest

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#121:1:A>
Uh well that  ' s not true and there  ' s no evidence for you of your
rest because he hadn't given evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#122:1:A>
And the questions I put to the witness is a matter really for me

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#123:1:A>
How I ask the questions

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#124:1:A>
What question I ask as a matter which may or may not will
naturally go to my client

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#125:1:A>
But basically it  ' s a matter for me and <?> defend </?> the rest
is not raised and I would just ask to to to completely ignored that

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#126:1:A>
And of course uhm my client the Second Defendant and that the
other Defendant also not uhm chosen to give evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#127:1:A>
But that  ' s their right

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#128:1:A>
You see I mean the case is is is <,> as I receded that prosecution
is simply unable to substantiate the allegations that they put in front of
you

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#129:1:A>
There is no other cogent evidence that you can rely on

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#130:1:A>
Mind you that the submission is not necessary

<ICE-HK:S2A-065#131:1:A>
Thank you </I>
