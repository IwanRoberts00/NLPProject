The front pages of the Monday papers were splashed with the sad
faces of Mrs Anson Chan and Mr Tim Fok

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#2:1:A>
Hong Kong has failed in his bid to host the two thousand six Asian
Games

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#3:1:A>
What is the cause of the Hong Kong  ' s failure

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#4:1:A>
Could we have won if we have done more

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#5:1:A>
I have no answers to these questions but I am sure that Hong Kong is
grateful for the efforts of Mrs Chan and Mr Fok

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#6:1:A>
A success would have confirmed that our confidence is well founded
but a failure I believe could do Hong Kong as much good as a success

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#7:1:A>
Instead of looking outwards with confidence it is time for Hong Kong
to look inwards to reflect on our strengths and weaknesses

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#8:1:A>
Should we be awarded the games by two thousand six we will have a
world class stadium at the site of the old airport and all our sports
facilities will be upgraded

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#9:1:A>
It will take the same time for Hong Kong to replace all our diesel
taxis

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#10:1:A>
Air pollution is a problem we can better understand than how to
bring in a major sports event but for various reasons the air quality of Hong
Kong is not improving as fast as we like it to be

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#11:1:A>
The major cause of air pollution in the urban areas is our fleet of
a hundred fifty thousand diesel vehicles

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#12:1:A>
Nearly all the commercial vehicles are diesel fueled

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#13:1:A>
These include the taxis mini-buses full-sized buses trucks and
other heavy vehicles

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#14:1:A>
Together these vehicles contributed two third of the mileage
covered by all road using motor vehicles in Hong Kong everyday

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#15:1:A>
The exhaust emissions from the diesel engines are the major sources
of suspended particles sulphur dioxide nitrous oxide and ozone

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#16:1:A>
These exhaust emissions reacts with the exhaust emissions that are
coming into Hong Kong from our neighbour to produce the alarming smog effects
and dramatic reduction in visibility in the winter months

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#17:1:A>
Our neighbour must not be blamed for our air pollution

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#18:1:A>
The main sources of pollution remain local

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#19:1:A>
The smog serves only as a reminder of the problem

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#20:1:A>
Neither is visibility my main concern

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#21:1:A>
My main concern is the health effects of air pollution

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#22:1:A>
These pollutants have been proven to cause attacks of asthma
progressive deterioration in lung functions nose allergies and even cancers

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#23:1:A>
It has been shown recently that admission to hospitals caused by
asthmatic attacks and acute deterioration of patients with chronic lung
problems increases with the worsening of air quality

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#24:1:A>
Sulphur dioxide has been shown to associate closely with lung
cancer

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#25:1:A>
The exhaust emissions from diesel engines have been classified a
probable cause of cancers by the World Health Organization

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#26:1:A>
The ill effects of some of these pollutants are cumulative and
impact most severely on people already suffering from chronic lung diseases

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#27:1:A>
There are no safe levels for these pollutants

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#28:1:A>
To a doctor allowing the unsatisfactory air <.> qua </.> quality to
persist is like allowing a treatable cancer to remain untreated

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#29:1:A>
In his year nineteen ninety nine Policy Address the Chief Executive
Mr Tung Chee Hwa announced a programme of measures to reduce the exhaust
emissions from motor vehicles

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#30:1:A>
Since then it has become the Government  ' s policy to gradually
phase out the diesel taxi and replace them gradually with the more
environmentally friendly Liquid Petroleum Gas LPG taxis

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#31:1:A>
The phasing out will take up till two thousand six to allow for the
usual life span of a diesel taxi and to allow the time for setting up an
adequate number of LPG filling stations

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#32:1:A>
This will solve about one quarter of the problem

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#33:1:A>
The test on LPG and electric mini-buses will go on till next year

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#34:1:A>
A decision will then be made on the fate of the diesel mini-buses

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#35:1:A>
It will take most likely another seven years to replace them

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#36:1:A>
Some diesel vehicles will remain on the roads in particular the
heavy vehicles

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#37:1:A>
To decrease their environmental impact various stringent
requirements on emission control the Euro three which is the latest European
Union requirements will be applied starting next year to the new diesel
vehicles

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#38:1:A>
Owners of old diesel vehicles will be encouraged to adopt remedial
measures such as by installing the particulate trap and the oxidative
catalysts

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#39:1:A>
All commercial vehicles will be subjected to an advanced smoke test
as part of the annual <.> ro </.> road worthiness inspection

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#40:1:A>
The fine on smoky vehicles will be increased to a thousand dollar

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#41:1:A>
The replacement of regular diesel with ultra-low sulphur diesel
ULSD will reduce the emission of suspended particles and nitrogen oxides

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#42:1:A>
The introduction of ULSD has been encouraged by concessionary
fuelled <,> duty

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#43:1:A>
Even though the fuel companies have been criticized for not passing
on the full benefit of the tax concession to consumers it is satisfying to
see that the only diesel available now at the fuel stations is ULSD

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#44:1:A>
To ensure that ULSD will be used enforcement action against the
sales of illegal diesel has to be stepped up

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#45:1:A>
I appeal for the franchise bus companies to switch over to the more
environmental friendly fuel

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#46:1:A>
Is stepping up <,> of control measures since last year warranted

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#47:1:A>
The answer is yes both in terms of the overt effects and the health
effects of air pollution

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#48:1:A>
In nineteen ninety one visibility fell below eight kilometres for
less than five percent of time

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#49:1:A>
In nineteen ninety seven visibility fell below eight kilometres per
for ten percent of the time

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#50:1:A>
Over the same period of time the annual mean roadside measurements
of respirable suspended particles and nitrous oxide have progressively
increased exceeding the one-year air quality objectives set by the
Environmental Protection Department

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#51:1:A>
The only important achievement is a reduction in sulphur dioxide
level

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#52:1:A>
Excess health risks were noted even on days when the measurements
were below the current set of air quality objectives

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#53:1:A>
Controlling the exhaust emission of the diesel vehicles is
addressing only part of the problem

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#54:1:A>
The stationary source of air pollution remain to be tackled

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#55:1:A>
These are the power stations and other industrial activities

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#56:1:A>
Standards of emission control for these sources have to be set up
or reviewed and vigourously enforced

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#57:1:A>
More stringent control on the sulphur contents of diesel for
industrial use is in order <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#58:1:A>
Controlling air pollution requires the political determination of
the government to push through the measures within a reasonable time frame
and often for the input of resources

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#59:1:A>
It will certainly help if Hong Kong people are not merely passive
beneficiaries of an improved air quality but also become part of the solution

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#60:1:A>
The very least we can do is to use our motor vehicles only when
absolutely necessary turn off the ignition when the car is stationary and
keep our cars in proper state of maintenance

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#61:1:A>
Let us make Hong Kong a city not only fit for the Asian Games but
also a city fit for the healthiest of all pursuits </I>

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#62:2:A>
In November last year the Dutch Parliament approved the bill
to exempt doctors who perform euthanasia under strict criteria from criminal
prosecution

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#63:2:A>
The bill will become law if it were passed in the upper House of
the Netherlands

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#64:2:A>
And the country will become the second place in the whole world to
legislate on mercy killing

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#65:2:A>
The Dutch Ministry of Justice maintains that the bill does not
amount to the legalization of euthanasia but to decriminalize euthanasia in
certain circumstances

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#66:2:A>
A doctor in the Netherlands currently performing euthanasia must
first report what remains a criminal act to a regional review committees of
doctors and lawyers

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#67:2:A>
This committee advise the public prosecution service which only
then drops the case if the doctor is judged to have followed the specific
criteria

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#68:2:A>
The new bill allows euthanasia performed by a doctor not to be
treated as a criminal offense if the criteria are followed

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#69:2:A>
The regional committees will be able to dismiss the case if the
bill were to become law

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#70:2:A>
Even though the public prosecution service could still launch its
own criminal investigation doctors has spoken off the psychological
significance of no longer being guilty until proved innocent

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#71:2:A>
The bill defines the criteria under which the performance of
euthanasia by doctors will not be treated as criminal

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#72:2:A>
Doctors must be convinced that the patient  ' s request is voluntary
and well considered and that the patient is facing unremitting and unbearable
suffering have advised the patient of his or her situation and prospects and
have reached a firm conclusion with the patient that there is no reasonable
alternative

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#73:2:A>
At least one other independent physician must have examined the
patient

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#74:2:A>
The Royal Dutch Medical Association welcomed the approval of the
bill by Parliament

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#75:2:A>
The association believe that Netherlands will benefit from the
possibility that patient can request euthanasia from doctors in situation of
hopeless and unbearable suffering

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#76:2:A>
Politicians hope that the new <.> leg </.> legal clarity will boost
the rates of reporting and thus able to put euthanasia under better
regulation

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#77:2:A>
Currently less than fifty percent of an estimated three thousand
six hundred cases of euthanasia a year are reported

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#78:2:A>
But both Protestant and Catholic communities fear that choosing to
die will become a normal practice

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#79:2:A>
Whether the Netherlands will benefit from the legislation remains
to be seen

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#80:2:A>
I believe that they can learn from the experience of Australia

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#81:2:A>
The Northern Territory of Australia is the first place in the whole
world to legislate on mercy killing only to have the law repealed nine months
after it has taken effect

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#82:2:A>
The provision of euthanasia for the terminally ill was legal in the
Northern Territory of Australia for nine months between July nineteen ninety
six and March nineteen ninety seven

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#83:2:A>
During this time seven patients all with cancer made formal use of
the act and four of them died under the act

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#84:2:A>
A report was compiled on these seven patients and was published in
a leading medical journal

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#85:2:A>
The act stipulated that two doctors had to agree that a patient had
a terminal illness that would result in the patient  ' s death in the normal
course and without application of extraordinary measures

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#86:2:A>
But one of the finding of the report was that <,> and I quote the
potential length of future life of a patient with cancer can be very
difficult to judge accurately and differences of expert opinion were evident
in two of these cases

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#87:2:A>
One case was a fifty-two-year-old woman with cancerous skin
condition who had well controlled pain but itchiness had resulted in intense
scratching followed by skin infection eyelid swelling with closure and a
persistent ear discharge

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#88:2:A>
One cancer specialist gave the patient  ' s prognosis as nine months
but a dermatologist and local oncologist judged that she was not terminally
ill

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#89:2:A>
Other doctors declined to give opinions

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#90:2:A>
After a national television appeal an orthopaedic surgeon agreed to
see her and certified that the provisions under the act had been complied
with

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#91:2:A>
She underwent euthanasia on the second January nineteen ninety
seven

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#92:2:A>
The act specifically requires a psychiatrist to confirm that
patients do not have a treatable clinical depression

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#93:2:A>
According to the report however four of the seven cases had
symptoms of depression including reduced reactivity lowered mood hopelessness
and suicidal thoughts

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#94:2:A>
Confirmation of depression was not easy because the patients saw
the psychiatric assessment as a hurdle to be overcome before their wish to
die is granted

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#95:2:A>
Will the Hong Kong people welcome legalizing euthanasia

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#96:2:A>
I do not have an answer to that but I believe that it would be a
most interesting debate if the subject were brought up in the Legislative
Council

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#97:2:A>
Hong Kong doctors are very cautious on this issue

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#98:2:A>
We value our profession as one that is to save life rather than one
is to take away life

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#99:2:A>
Euthanasia if taken to mean giving or not giving treatment with the
intention to kill a patient is not acceptable I believe to the majority of
doctors in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#100:2:A>
We however can accept stopping useless treatment

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#101:2:A>
A treatment is useless when it will not have any effect whatsoever
on the patient and won't affect the outcome whether it is given <,> or not

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#102:2:A>
It is not the doctor  ' s intention to let the patient die by
stopping useless treatment

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#103:2:A>
Useless treatment is stopped simply because it is useless

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#104:2:A>
Even then what is useless treatment can still be a matter of great
controversy

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#105:2:A>
A social debate on euthanasia can lead us to into a reflection on
the meaning of life the sovereignty of life death and whether we have the
right to choose to die

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#106:2:A>
The last month of the lunar year is an auspicious month for
reflection

<ICE-HK:S2B-030#107:2:A>
Reflection on death can be a most refreshing experience and I must
assure you that you won't die earlier by so doing </I>
