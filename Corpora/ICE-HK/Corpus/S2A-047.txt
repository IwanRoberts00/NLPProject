<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-047#1:1:A>
School timetabling <?> tasks </?> uh can be roughly <.> di </.>
uh divided into two part

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#2:1:A>
The first part is called timetable planning the other part is called
timetable <.> si </.> scheduling

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#3:1:A>
Uh the timetable planning is that <,> uhm we have some people
usually are senior staff member in the school <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#4:1:A>
Uh he or she will identify <,> the resources that will be needed <,>
in order to <,> uh <,> uh uh uh to conduct a lesson

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#5:1:A>
For example uh <,> what sort of room will be used for a particular
particular lesson

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#6:1:A>
For example PE of course uh physical education <,> lesson will need
to use uh playground <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#7:1:A>
So <?> those </?> first of all we have to associate all those
resources with the lesson need

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#8:1:A>
And we have <,> uhm we we also need to identify any resources
constraint such as uh <,> uh resource <?> are weak </?> in budget

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#9:1:A>
Uh for example whether a teacher will available at a particular time

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#10:1:A>
Or whether a room or class will be available et cetera <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#11:1:A>
Uh <,> we also need to identify all the timetable uh timetabling
constraint happens such as uhm many school would have <?> these </?> sort of
requirement

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#12:1:A>
Or no PE lesson after lunch

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#13:1:A>
I mean it maybe maybe after lunch

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#14:1:A>
And uh they are very <,> uh uh particular uhm <,> uhm <,>
constraints in some some schools

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#15:1:A>
For example some <,> primary school would have a constraint such
that PE lesson or particular class will not be conducted in successive base

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#16:1:A>
Uhm the reason is uh <,> quite quite strange to me

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#17:1:A>
Cause uh they they do have a reason

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#18:1:A>
Uhm <,> the reason is uhm

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#19:1:A>
When a when a pupil <,> have a PE lesson

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#20:1:A>
Then he uh when when he or she <,> uh go uh when he or she uh goes
home

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#21:1:A>
Then the <,> they need to wash their PE uniform and uh the <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#22:1:A>
Therefore the uhm the uniform may not be able to dry up you uh in
time

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#23:1:A>
So that  ' s why they need to <,> uh have <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#24:1:A>
They they need to uh separate <,> the PE lesson for uh for for <,>
primary school

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#25:1:A>
And what <?> with </?> identify all those uh constraint maybe
course available

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#26:1:A>
Then of course we need <,> to assign or some teacher to conduct to
some lesson

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#27:1:A>
I what but <,> but uh when I said assign uh I mean associating uh
lessons with uh teachings that  ' s all

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#28:1:A>
So <,> for example uhm <,> teacher A maybe assigned to teach a
number of classes for a particular subject <,> uh with a particular number of
meeting uh number of lessons

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#29:1:A>
Of course we also need to identify how long the lesson would be
would that be <,> ten uh single period lesson

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#30:1:A>
Or would that would that be uh two single period lesson and <,>
three double period lesson et cetera <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#31:1:A>
So usually now this I think all these tasks will be prepared by a
senior staff member in the school <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#32:1:A>
However the scheduling tasks may not be done by the senior staff

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#33:1:A>
It maybe done by some junior staff

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#34:1:A>
You know that it  ' s a very <unc> one- word </unc> task

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#35:1:A>
So <?> senior </?> staff can ask somebody to help them

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#36:1:A>
And uhm <,> we we understand that the task is to assign all lessons
<,> uh <,> to the schoolmaster  ' s timetable

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#37:1:A>
So that all constraint will be satisfied

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#38:1:A>
And any preferences <,> or if there are any preferences <,> then uh
we help you uhm

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#39:1:A>
Then she will then as many as <,> uhm <,> as many preferences as
possible will be fixed by as well

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#40:1:A>
And uh usually we will uh find that uh at the end of the timetable
<,> process I would

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#41:1:A>
When I say at the end of the timetabling process I mean

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#42:1:A>
Uh even though uh when we use a computer to try to solve the
problem

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#43:1:A>
Usually we won't be able to solve them all

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#44:1:A>
Then maybe uh three percent of the lessons need to be addressed uh
manually

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#45:1:A>
And <,> uh <,,> it is uhm not unusual to pick uh more than hundred
many hours completed to to complete the whole task <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#46:1:A>
And uh I  ' ll give you some supporting evidences in a <.> min </.>
in a minute <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#47:1:A>
And uhm in <,> nineteen ninety <,> nineteen ninety five uh
Education Department <,> uh introduced its first timetabling software for
school use

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#48:1:A>
It  ' s called PDSS

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#49:1:A>
Uh PDSS <,> uh in fact <,> uh was awaking uh as a annual field
project in uhm uhm Chinese U

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#50:1:A>
And uhm <,> in uhm <,> ninety five of <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#51:1:A>
Uhm the work has been customized and uh introduced for school use

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#52:1:A>
And uh it is integrated as a part of uh TBSS

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#53:1:A>
Uh sorry as a <?> Sams </?> component

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#54:1:A>
And uh the system was written in C in C language

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#55:1:A>
Uhm so the integration of uh TDSS to <?> Sams </?> is not as kind
<,> as uh ED would like to see

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#56:1:A>
Because uhm <,> they use uh two different setup environments

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#57:1:A>
And uhm <,> for those who don't have any ideas on <?> Sams </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#58:1:A>
<?> Sams </?> is a school administrating system offered by the ED
for school use

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#59:1:A>
And uhm in the <,> uhm back engine of the <,> uhm system

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#60:1:A>
I mean the <?> Sams course </?> system <,> uh is <unc> one-word
</unc> <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#61:1:A>
And PDSS was decided as a decision support system

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#62:1:A>
Uhm the idea <,> uh was uh it is very hard for uh computer to able
to know all the uh all the proper decision but uh the <?> decision </?> rule
that have <,> been uh inside the mind of a timetabling expert

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#63:1:A>
So the there will be kind of <,> thing is much uh better

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#64:1:A>
It is a much better idea to <,> have a system <,> which provide
some constraint package as well as <,> some uh <,> decision tools to aim the
timetable or the timetabling to do the job <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#65:1:A>
And <,> next I would like to uh introduce uh the <,> good surveys
that I mentioned early

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#66:1:A>
The first one <,> uh was conducted by <,> uh <,> a number of
researchers

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#67:1:A>
Uh by Kwok Kwong and <unc> one-word </unc> of <,> uhm

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#68:1:A>
Doctor Kwok is from the uhm City University and Mr Kwong is
currently work uh as a lecturer in the <,> in the uhm <,> <unc> one-word
</unc> <,> Hong Kong I <.> Ed </.>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#69:1:A>
I  ' m not quite sure <?> where  ' s </?> uhm about him

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#70:1:A>
And uhm they conduct the survey in October nineteen ninety nineteen
ninety five <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#71:1:A>
And uhm <?> aim is </?> to try to understand the timetabling
problem for secondary schools

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#72:1:A>
And uh they send <,> out all hundred and eighty questionnaire

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#73:1:A>
Or which covers almost <?> all </?> the secondary schools in Hong
Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#74:1:A>
And uh one hundred and seventy three uh were returned <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#75:1:A>
And uh what <,> as we known though

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#76:1:A>
Most of the <,> <?> respondings </?> are are of are come from the
uh grammars school

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#77:1:A>
There are a few uh <,> respondent from <,> uhm <,> some special
school but not many <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#78:1:A>
And uh what they <,> found <,> the <,> that uhm

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#79:1:A>
The number of teachers in a schools around uhm fifty two or fifty
three which is an average number

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#80:1:A>
And the number of classroom <?> as a test </?> room in a school <,>
is about twenty five and about uh <?> thirty </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#81:1:A>
And number of classes is around <.> thir </.> uh sorry twenty nine

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#82:1:A>
When you read those figures then you you may notice that

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#83:1:A>
The number of classroom <,> I mean the average number is twenty
five or twenty six

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#84:1:A>
However the number of classes <,> is twenty nine

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#85:1:A>
So that  ' s mean we do not have enough <?> spared </?> classroom to
support all the classes

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#86:1:A>
That means <,> some of the classes will not will not <,> uh have
any home room <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#87:1:A>
And uhm quickly the number of time slot in a teaching cycle is
around uh twenty seven <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#88:1:A>
So most of the school will adopt a teaching cycle of five or six
days

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#89:1:A>
And uhm for each day you will have uh eight or nine <,> periods of
lessons <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#90:1:A>
And uhm the researchers uh found the problem is quite complex in a
sense that uh the number of free

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#91:1:A>
Uh there are some uh uh free lessons uh <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#92:1:A>
On average there are about five uh free lessons per <,> time slot

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#93:1:A>
When I when I say a <?> free </?> lesson that means a lesson will
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#94:1:A>
Uh a class of student will be split into two or more groups

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#95:1:A>
So that they have to go to different rooms to attend the lesson

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#96:1:A>
So at least two rooms and two teachers will be asked to attend a
free lesson

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#97:1:A>
And the situation will be getting more complicated if we have to
split and combine

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#98:1:A>
So perhaps we have three group of students split into <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#99:1:A>
Sorry three classes of students split into five groups

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#100:1:A>
And uh they maybe taught by uh different uh teachers in different
<,> venue

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#101:1:A>
And of course there are more complicated uh timetabling
requirement

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#102:1:A>
And I  ' ll uh give you some idea on on those requirement uh later
on <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#103:1:A>
And uhm there are uh double period and <?> thirdable </?> period
lesson as well

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#104:1:A>
Uhm <,> it sounds of <,> uhm it sounds of quite usual with the why
<,> uh I mention it that

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#105:1:A>
I mention are those further case instead <,> of who would not
allow uh <,> uh the multi period lessons to be uh <,> placed across recess or
lunch

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#106:1:A>
That is the usual case

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#107:1:A>
Uh however they they had there are some school uhm <,> such that
they they they may allow uh to have multi period lesson <?> it </?> places
across recess if they are not able to find a <?> sit </?> any other suitable
places for those lessons <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#108:1:A>
So if we have more this sort of multi period lessons that means uh
we we do not have <,> uh <,> <&> tut </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#109:1:A>
Or we may have a a a smaller degree of flexibility in placing
those period into a time into a timetable

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#110:1:A>
And uhm <,> regarding the timetabling method on <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#111:1:A>
They found the average number of hours <?> spended </?> or in
constructing a timetable at that time <,> would be uh around a hundred and
sixty <?> hour </?> <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#112:1:A>
And uh <,> uh <,> no notice that this particular figure include uh
those school who construct their timetable manually or with the use of
computer <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#113:1:A>
Uhm <,> so <,> it it will <?> depend </?> more data about the
degree of population of that is a use of that can use with a with the
timetabling task

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#114:1:A>
All twenty two percent <,> uhm conduct the timetabling task
manually

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#115:1:A>
And uhm the rest seventy eight percent use a <unc> several
words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#116:1:A>
However only three five percent uh

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#117:1:A>
Sorry five uh twenty five percent of uh schools use computer only
for constraint checking <,> that means uh they have to make a decision where
to put a particular uh lessons onto the master timetable

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#118:1:A>
So it  ' s <unc> one-word </unc> uh manual <.> de </.> uh
uhm decision to be done manually

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#119:1:A>
So basically the scheduling task is performed by the human being
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#120:1:A>
And <,> the other twenty five percent are in use some uhm
<unc> one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#121:1:A>
Uhm sorry use the computer tools to uh generate the timetable uh
<unc> one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#122:1:A>
Uh however these twenty five percent of people had to do <?> some
</?> many work after the <?> timetabling </?> process

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#123:1:A>
Because uh they found the the <?> pins </?> was not worth enough
to generate the whole timetable for them <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#124:1:A>
Only around nine percent of the schools <?> care </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#125:1:A>
They were able to generate the whole timetable with the with the
use of the <,> <unc> one-word </unc> timetable software

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#126:1:A>
Because if we look at these

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#127:1:A>
Uh you may sum up these two figure <,> then you can see that uh uh
<,> about fifty seven percent of schools generate the timetable manually <&>
A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#128:1:A>
And <,> uh they also look at uhm those completion rate of or the
computer tools adopted by the uh is uh by the school at that time

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#129:1:A>
And <,> they uhm <,> select all the <?> resound </?> all the the
uh related data

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#130:1:A>
And uh <,> then uh analysis the data and find that <,> the mean
completion rate was extremely low

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#131:1:A>
It was only sixty seven percent

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#132:1:A>
That means uh if you if a school have a one hundred <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#133:1:A>
Sorry uh one thousand time slot to fill in

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#134:1:A>
Then uh we we can just fill in six hundred and seventy

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#135:1:A>
So that that means there are a lot of periods to be filled up okay
but manually <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#136:1:A>
And uh <,> that is <,> uhm uh <unc> three words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#137:1:A>
Because of many <,> uhm many timetables in school

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#138:1:A>
It try to use some timetabling tools

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#139:1:A>
And however at the end they they found the time to uh to spend on
many <,> uh timetabling at the end is almost the same <,> as those time used
to <,> uh construct a timetable manually at the beginning

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#140:1:A>
So <,> uh <,> the figure was <,> not or satisfactory or is nice or
say <?> encouraging </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#141:1:A>
And uhm <,> but we have to uhm understand that at that time they
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#142:1:A>
There were no uh <?> goods </?> timetabling software on the market

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#143:1:A>
Uh <,,> for those who use a a timetabling system to <?> make </?>
school timetable uhm

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#144:1:A>
Sixty six percent they <?> face </?> their software from the
market

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#145:1:A>
Uhm fourteen percent uh develop their own <,> their own uh
timetabling software and they were very <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#146:1:A>
They they were very brave

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#147:1:A>
And uh in fact uh the developing of timetabling system is a very
challenging task

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#148:1:A>
And uh only fourteen percent use <,> PES PDSS because <,> uh PESS
was just launched at that time

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#149:1:A>
And the this particular survey was conducted in October nineteen
uh ninety five

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#150:1:A>
So just a few month after the launch of the of PDSS

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#151:1:A>
That that account why there are so few school using the software

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#152:1:A>
And uhm <,> yes a few school uhm uh ask some software <?> cost
</?> to be <?> divide </?> a software system for that <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#153:1:A>
And uh in <,> nine in March nineteen ninety uh nineteen ninety
nine I conduct a similar survey

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#154:1:A>
And uhm <,,> I <,> I try to understand a little bit more on
timetabling <?> require </?> uh <,> of secondary schools

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#155:1:A>
And uh uh I also uh would like to <,> see whether uhm <,> more
school are start to use uh <?> automated </?> timetabling software to do with
the timetabling task

<ICE-HK:S2A-047#156:1:A>
And <,> uhm more importantly I would like to know or whether
school uh whether uhm uh automated system would really help to reduce school
workload </I>
