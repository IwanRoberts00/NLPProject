Can you find it

<ICE-HK:S1B-018#57:1:A>

traumatic

<ICE-HK:S1B-018#58:1:A>

If it is a traumatic experience that means <,> uh well make you
feel very very unpleasant and upsetting

<ICE-HK:S1B-018#60:1:A>
For example uh the death of a member of your family is a traumatic
experience

<ICE-HK:S1B-018#61:1:A>
Can you follow

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-018#62:1:?> <[> Blood suck </[> </{>

Leeches are being use in intricate and delicate operations
involving limb transplants okay

And then blood at the site of the operation often fails to return
to the heart through the veins

<ICE-HK:S1B-018#72:1:A>
This blocks the supply of fresh blood and results in the death and
decay of <?> issue </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-018#73:1:A>
In order to remove this blood surgeons are using leeches

<ICE-HK:S1B-018#74:1:A>
Okay in this paragraph the writer is giving you an example showing
