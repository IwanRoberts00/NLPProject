<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#3:1>
A number of interesting new wireless devices are expected to make
their debut when CeBIT 2003 , the world  ' s largest and most important annual
geekfest , kicks off in Hanover , Germany , this week . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#4:1>
Palm is expected to introduce a new wireless wonder , the Tungsten
C , at the show even before it gets the Tungsten W , its combination mobile
phone-personal digital assistant &obrack;  PDA &cbrack; , out to the rest of the world . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#5:1>
Details of the Tungsten C  ' s technical specifications are hazy ,
but it is rumoured to have integrated Wi-Fi to boost its corporate appeal .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#6:1>
Palm has been trying to increase corporate sales with its high-end
Tungsten devices , but has had limited success . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#7:1>
A leaked picture of the new Tungsten C on the Internet shows that
it looks like the Tungsten W minus the antenna . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#8:1>
Unlike the smaller integrated-Bluetooth Tungsten T , the Tungsten
W does not run PalmSource  ' s latest Palm 5.0 operating system . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#9:1>
Henry Cheung , sales director at Palm Asia Pacific , says it runs
version 4.1 because version 5.0 cannot yet support mobile phone functions .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#10:1>
It is not yet known whether the new Tungsten C will run Palm 5.0
or 4.1 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#11:1>
The former has enhanced security features that would go well with the
integrated Wi-Fi function for corporate adoption . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#12:1>
Hong Kong  ' s Group Sense &obrack;  International &cbrack; is expected to announce
a Palm OS-based communicator following a licensing agreement with PalmSource
in December to develop Palm-based smartphones . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#13:1>
Group Sense rolled out a Chinese-based PDA-phone in September
2001 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#14:1>
MobileOffice e938 was based on Microsoft  ' s Windows CE operating
system and had a full range of communication functions , including voice ,
fax , e-mail , Wireless Application Protocol and short-messaging services .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#15:1>
The new Palm OS PDA-phone is also expected to be Chinese-based
and widely speculated to be more data-centric than phone-centric , like
Kyocera  ' s Palm-based smartphone . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#16:1>
Another rumoured gadget expected to make its mark at CeBIT is a
wireless iPaq from Hewlett-Packard .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#17:1>
Rumours of the wireless iPaq started last year when the company
unveiled the iPaq 5450 , featuring an antenna , a speaker , a microphone and
a SIM card slot . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#18:1>
HP said at the time it was considering introducing a combination
device featuring PDA and mobile phone functions like the Jornada WDA928 &obrack; 
which has been released only in Britain and Singapore &cbrack; , but it would not
confirm that the next version of the iPaq would feature phone functions .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#19:1>
The iPaq 5450 , which is going down well with enterprises , has
integrated Wi-Fi and a biometric security system as well as Intel  ' s latest
XScale 400 megahertz processor . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#20:1>
The wireless iPaq , which will be a triband phone , will drop
integrated Wi-Fi for general packet radio services &obrack;  GPRS &cbrack; connectivity .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#21:1>
Sony will introduce a new mid-range Clie tomorrow , with
integrated Bluetooth running Palm 5.0 . The Clie TG50 was announced in Japan
last week . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#22:1>
The new Clie has a flip cover , much like the SJ33's , but it
does not function as a mobile phone .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#23:1>
Sony officials said users could pair a Bluetooth phone like the Sony
Ericsson T100 with the new Clie to download and access e-mail . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#24:1>
The TG50 lacks an integrated digital camera and , unlike the old
Clies , will not feature a Graffiti area .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#25:1>
You can write anywhere on the screen now .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#26:1>
However , you do not get a bigger screen because Sony has put in a
qwerty keyboard below the display . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#27:1>
The keyboard is fast becoming a standard in mid-range and
high-end Palm devices because users prefer to have more input options . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#28:1>
This is the first Clie to have a keyboard and screen sitting
together .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#29:1>
The NZ and NX 70 series , and the new NZ-90 , have clamshell designs
with a screen built into the flip cover .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#30:1>
The TG50 has 16 megabytes of built-in memory and a Memory Stick
expansion slot . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#31:1>
Clie TG50 is expected to dampen sales of Palm  ' s Tungsten T ,
which has not done well despite price cuts .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#32:1>
Sony Hong Kong is expected to reveal pricing details at tomorrow  ' s
launch but the TG50 will probably retail for HK&dollar;3,500 to
HK&dollar;4,500 .

<bold> HP Pavilion T152d </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#37:2>
Specifications </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#38:2>
<bold> Price: </bold> HK&dollar;12,680 with the 15-inch LCD
display and HK&dollar;13,680 with the 17-inch display </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#39:2>
<bold> Pros: </bold> Latest PC for the home with multimedia
features </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#40:2>
<bold> Cons: </bold> Pricing not as competitive as Dell  ' s </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#41:2>
Hewlett-Packard  ' s latest PC for the home under its Pavilion
brand sports an Intel Pentium 4 chip running at 2.53 gigahertz , 256
megabytes of Ram and a healthy 80 gigabytes of hard disk . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#42:2>
Pitched as a desktop that can double as an entertainment system ,
the T152d has a built-in digital TV tuner , allowing you to watch and record
TV programmes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#43:2>
Nearly all top-end PCs now come with DVD burners , and the T152d
is no exception .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#44:2>
HP  ' s burner supports the DVD+R/+RW format and is backward compatible
with most DVD and CD-Rom drives . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#45:2>
HP has also integrated a six-in-one media drive that can read
Memory Stick and SmartMedia , MultiMedia , Secure Digital and CompactFlash
cards . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#46:2>
The price tag of branded desktop PCs equipped with the latest
Intel Pentium 4 , 2.53GHz chips are fairly prohibitive at about
HK&dollar;12,000 , so I recommend buyers look at the 2.4GHz range , which
offers prices of about HK&dollar;3,000 less for that little bit of
clock-speed difference . </p>

<bold> Sony Wega KLV-30MR1 </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#50:3>
Specifications </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#51:3>
<bold> Price: </bold> HK&dollar;39,880 </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#52:3>
<bold> Pros: </bold> Superb design gives it a viewing effect
wider than its 30 inches </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#53:3>
<bold> Cons: </bold> Paying the premium for the Sony name </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#54:3>
Coming to Fortress soon is a new 30-inch liquid-crystal display
television from Sony .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#55:3>
If you think the sleek , silver LCD TVs from Sharp , Samsung and
Philips are good-looking , wait till you lay eyes on this beauty . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#56:3>
Priced at HK&dollar;39,880 , the Sony LCD Wega TV KLV-30MR1 is
almost affordable with Fortress ' instalment plans , at least for a Sony
product . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#57:3>
The new wide-screen LCD Wega is encased in an ultra-slim and a
truly elegant glass-frame display , which gives it a floating effect . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#58:3>
There is a subtle illumination effect on the Sony logo and the
light indicators on its function panel really enhance the design .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#59:3>
It will be the talking point in any living room . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#60:3>
The new Wega has high contrast even in a very bright room , and
its picture resolution of 1280 by 768 pixels is sharp and crystal clear .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#61:3>
I was unable to compare it to other competing 30-inch LCD TVs , but
once the product is selling in Fortress alongside other TVs , you will be
able to judge for yourself . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#62:3>
Sony has equipped the LCD Wega with its recently developed LCD
Panel Driver , a new digital processing technology to ensure a smoother and
clearer image flow by improving the response time and enhancing moving image
resolution . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#63:3>
It also comes with built-in 20-watt speakers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#64:3>
Even though the Wega will almost certainly be connected to a DVD or
video player , its media receiver unit , like virtually every Sony product
these days , has a Memory Stick slot . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#68:4>
You would think there are enough laptop-toting yuppie road
warriors in this town to fill a small Pacific Coffee shop in Taikoo Place .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#69:4>
It has been more than a year since PCCW wired up about 30 Pacific
Coffee cafes across Hong Kong with wireless broadband Internet access . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#70:4>
PCCW has since added Starbucks , Delifrance and other smaller
coffee houses to the list of Wi-Fi hot spots , but a tour of Pacific Coffee ,
Starbucks and some independent coffee houses with WLAN prompts a
disheartening observation - I am often the only one logging on to the service .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#71:4>
Since Samsung equipped me with its latest sleek and very
beautiful X10 notebook PC with Intel mobile Centrino technology for
evaluation purposes , I have been going on an international Wi-Fi hot spot
testing rampage .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#72:4>
While coffee house computing is cool , the experience of logging on
is patchy and should be more friendly to the user . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#73:4>
One of the main problems is that , apart from some Pacific Coffee
shops and some Starbucks , there are few places where you can get wirelessly
online outside of the office .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#74:4>
Never mind that by 2005 , more than 80 per cent of professional
laptops will have 802.11 WLAN interface &obrack;  according to Gartner research
group &cbrack; and that about 7,000 hot spots are expected to sprout up by the same
year in the Asia-Pacific region , earning more than US&dollar;1.3 billion
from 10.2 million users . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#75:4>
These are really encouraging and uplifting figures , but my
experience surfing in WLAN cafes was quite the contrary . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#76:4>
The hardware may be there , but easily accessible networks
connected to the Internet and consistent , reliable connection are not . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#77:4>
For example , if you try to log on to the service at Pacific
Coffee at PCCW Tower in Taikoo Place , getting access from the tables placed
outside the shop is impossible , even though you are supposed to be able to
get connected .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#78:4>
So accessing your e-mail while having a smoke is out of the question .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#79:4>
Further , the service is patchy , especially if you are looking to
connect free . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#80:4>
Swire offers free connectivity to its Taikoo Place , CityPlaza
and Pacific Place customers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#81:4>
To log on free , you have to submit your e-mail address and complete
a short survey .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#82:4>
While that works sometimes , it does not work all the time .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#83:4>
When it does not work , there is no one at Pacific Coffee able to
help you out . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#84:4>
In the past month , I have twice tried logging on from Chek Lap
Kok airport .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#85:4>
Wi-Fi connectivity was advertised to be airport-wide , but I could
only get access from Starbucks and some gates close to Cathay Pacific lounges .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#86:4>
The Singapore airport had free WLAN access , too , but the
experience , though smooth , was a little annoying because of the long online
survey form you have to fill before you can enjoy the free wireless ride .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#87:4>
My biggest problem with hot spots in Hong Kong is the lack of clearly
displayed signs telling you that you have entered a Wi-Fi zone . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#88:4>
In Singapore , signs are clearly displayed with a recognisable
Wi-Fi-zone symbol .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#89:4>
SingTel , one of two Wi-Fi hot spot operators there , is also heavily
promoting its hot spots with television commercials educating audi ences
where to find hot spots and how to log on - something else that is lacking
here . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#90:4>
To log on to a SingTel-operated hot spot , you have to key in
your mobile phone number and the password is your ID card number .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#91:4>
Only SingTel subscribers can use the service , unlike PCCW  ' s service
where non-Netvigator customers can also use the service by paying for it with
their credit cards . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#92:4>
In almost every hot spot I had taken the Samsung X10 to , I was
often the only Wi-Fi user .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#93:4>
At a Starbucks in the Bank of America building , I was able to talk
to another Wi-Fi user . He was accessing e-mail using an HP iPaq . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#94:4>
&ldquo; I don't think many of my colleagues know about hot spots
or what they are , in fact .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#95:4>
The carriers get more mind share , I think , but GPRS is so expensive
so most people think accessing e-mail on the go is a costly exercise .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#96:4>
I prefer WLAN anyway because it is higher-bandwidth and cheaper .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#97:4>
If you are working in Central , it is pretty easy to find a hot spot
, &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#98:4>
There are more hot spots in Hong Kong than Singapore - slightly
more than 200 here and about 120 in Singapore .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#99:4>
But if you were walking about in each city , you would get the
feeling that there are more hot spots in Singapore because of the clearly
labelled Wi-Fi zones .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#100:4>
At Singapore Changi airport , it is also easy to locate hot spots -
big white booths with Intel mobile Centrino marketing signs . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#101:4>
SingTel  ' s plan is priced at 20.8 Singaporean cents &obrack;  about
HK&dollar;0.98 &cbrack; per minute , while StarHub charges S&dollar;0.0015 for every
kilobyte of data downloaded .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#102:4>
PCCW charges HK&dollar;6 per 10-minute block for non-Netvigator
users , while Netvigator subscribers ' rates are HK&dollar;3 per 10-minute
session . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#103:4>
As an alternative , a monthly package of HK&dollar;28 for 20
sessions has also been introduced to Netvigator subscribers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#104:4>
Configuring your laptop for WLAN is easy , provided you know
what to click .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#105:4>
While it seemed obvious to activate the WLAN configuration setting
or your Windows network setting to gain access , the average PC user might
not know what to do and Starbucks staff will not be able to help .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#106:4>
It is easier using a laptop equipped with Intel  ' s mobile Centrino
technology - it automatically detects Wi-Fi zones and to enter , it is just
one button click . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#114:5>
Casio has made its latest personal digital assistant , the
Cassiopeia E-200 , so expandable that it is sure to appeal to the geeks among
us . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#115:5>
The feature-rich PDA is equipped with both a Compact Flash card
slot and a Secure Digital slot .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#116:5>
You can also buy an optional PC card unit to provide a third slot .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#117:5>
You might wonder why anyone would need so many slots in one
device .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#118:5>
For a serious geek , however , there can be no such thing as too
many expansion slots . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#119:5>
You can boost the built-in 64 megabytes of random access memory
with an SD or CF memory card . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#120:5>
To get Bluetooth connectivity , you can use either the SD or CF
slot to stick in a third-party SD or CF Bluetooth card .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#121:5>
With the PC card unit , you can stick in a wireless modem card to
get general packet radio service connectivity or Wi-Fi access .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#122:5>
Or you could insert a Wi-Fi CF card and a GPS unit in the PC card
slot - the possibilities abound . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#123:5>
Measuring 13x8.2x1.7cm , it is not the most compact Pocket PC
around .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#124:5>
It is slightly larger than a pack of playing cards and looks heavier
than its 200 grams .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#125:5>
Built for robust use , it is not as sleek as Toshiba or Fujitsu
Pocket PCs . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#126:5>
The device runs on a 206 megahertz Intel StrongARM processor and
has 32MB of Rom .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#127:5>
Casio says that you can get up to 10 hours of continuous use from
the two included batteries - a lithium-ion main battery and a small backup -
both of which are replaceable . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#128:5>
To further extend battery life , you can turn the backlight down
to a lower setting . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#129:5>
The E-200 has a bright , sharp , 16-bit screen .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#130:5>
It is a reflective screen , which is easy to view in bright sunlight .

<ICE-HK:W2B-032#131:5>
It is possible to turn off the front light to save battery life .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-032#132:5>
However , I prefer the transflective screens found on Sony  ' s
Clies and Hewlett-Packard  ' s colour iPaqs . </p>
