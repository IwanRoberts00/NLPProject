<h> <ul> <bold> <it> Introduction </it> </bold> </ul> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#2:1>
<p> Before looking into the contents of the two constitutions , it is
necessary to define the term &ldquo; constitution &rdquo; in order to have a
clear concept .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#3:1>
In Finer  ' s word <fnr> <sp> 1 </sp> </fnr> , it is <quote> &ldquo;
Codes of rules which govern the allocation of functions , powers and duties
among various governmental agencies and their officers , and define the
relationships between them and the public . &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#4:1>
While according to Wheare <fnr> <sp> 2 </sp> </fnr> , it is <quote>
&ldquo; a selection of legal rules which govern the government of that
country and which have been embodied in a document . &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#5:1>
In fact , any society or country can draw up its constitution-in order
to establish certain guidelines in operating itself .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#6:1>
Here the constitutions-of two &ldquo; states/colonies &rdquo; are
concerned .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#7:1>
The comparison between them will start with the classification of
types of States in which they belong to . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#8:1>
<h> <bold> <it> I. Types of States </it> </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#9:1>
<h> <bold  <it> > i. Federal/Unitary </it> </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#10:1>


<p> Australia and Hong Kong are two examples falling within these two
categories .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#11:1>
In a federal state power is distributed between central and regional
authorities , each locus of government enjoying exclusive competence or sole
power in relation to defined matters within its territory .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#12:1>
<sp> <fnr> 3 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#13:1>
Australia is a federation .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#14:1>
Every Australian must obey two sets of laws .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#15:1>
There are two elected governments and two Constitutions .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#16:1>
These two sets of governments and Constitutions are <it> Commonwealth
</it> and <it> State </it> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#17:1>
Under such classification Hong Kong is governed with a unitary system .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#18:1>
It is because in Hong Kong there is only one government authority
controlling the entire territory , namely <it> the Hong Kong Government </it> .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#19:1>
<h> <bold> <it> ii. Presidential Executive/Parliamentary
Executive/Gubernatorial </it> </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#20:1>


<p> When we say that a state  ' s chief executive is presidential , that means
the executive is not a member of the legislature .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#21:1>
If the chief executive is a member of and responsible to the
legislature , the system is classified as <it> parliamentary </it> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#22:1>
In this sense Australia is said to be operated under this kind of
system that places ultimate authority in the legislative assembly .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#23:1>
<fnr> <sp> 4 </sp> </fnr> On the other hand , Hong Kong is neither
presidential nor parliamentary executive in nature .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#24:1>
The Government in Hong Kong is a <it> gubernatorial </it> one&semi;
the governor is both legislature and chief executive in the territory and
there are few limitations on his authority . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#25:1>
<h> <bold> <it> iii. Bicameral/Unicameral </it> </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#26:1>


<p> In Hong Kong there is a unicameral legislative assembly which endowed as
part of a legislature with limited legislative authority .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#27:1>
While the federal Parliament in Australia is a bicameral law-making
body .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#28:1>
The two chambers&semi; the upper and the Lower Houses , are the
Senate and the House of Representatives , and the third component of
parliament is the Queen/Crown who acts through the Governor-General . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#29:1>
<h> <bold> <it> iv. Written/Unwritten </it> </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#30:1>


<p> Constitution can be either a written or an unwritten one .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#31:1>
A written constitution is enacted according to certain procedures
that gives it pre-eminence among the state  ' s laws .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#32:1>
There is a written constitution in both Australia and Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#33:1>
The Australian , Constitution is originated from an Act of the United
Kingdom parliament while the constitution in Hong Kong is comprised of the
Letters patent and Royal Instructions . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#34:1>
<h> <bold> <it> v. Flexible/Rigid </it> </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#35:1>


<p> When we say that a constitution is flexible , that means it can be
inadvertently or impliedly amended .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#36:1>
<fnr> <sp> 5 </sp> </fnr> However , as the main function of a written
constitution is to provide a set of rules and principles which act as the
guidelines of the operation of the government , thus most of the written
constitutions are more rigid and difficult to amend .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#37:1>
In Hong Kong , the Constitution cannot be amended by the Hong Kong
legislature and from this point of view it can be regarded as a rigid one .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#38:1>
But on the other hand , it can be easily amended or replaced by the
authority in the United Kingdom which made it or overridden by any Act of
Parliament , therefore from the British  ' s point of view the Hong Kong
Constitution is flexible to be amended . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#39:1>


<p> In Australia , the Constitution is a permanent document and can be
amended only with great difficulty .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#40:1>
According to Lane <fnr> <sp> 6 </sp> </fnr> , a proposed amendment to
the Constitution must first be passed by an absolute majority of each House
of parliament , or at least of one House if the other House refuses .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#41:1>
Then a majority of the &ldquo; state &rdquo; electors in a majority
of States must approve the amendment .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#42:1>
On top of this , a majority of the &ldquo; national &rdquo; electors
in all the States , and , since July 1971 , in the two internal territories
must approve the amendment .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#43:1>
Thus the Australian Constitution is strictly rigid to be amended .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#44:1>
In addition , one must notice that while the Commonwealth
Constitution is difficult to be amended , the State Constitutions are rather
&ldquo; flexible &rdquo; , which can be impliedly amended .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#46:1>
<h> <bold> <it> II Historical Background of the two Constitutions
</it> </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#47:1>


<p> After comparing the general characteristics of the two Constitutions , we
now come to their historical background : Hong Kong is a British colony
because of the treaties signed by China and Britain in 1842 , 1860 and 1898 .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#48:1>
The next step of the British monarch was to issue an <it> Order in
Council </it> that formally took possession of the territory .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#49:1>
The most basic constitutional documents in Hong Kong include the <it>
Charter </it> of April 1843 which constituted the island of Hong Kong as a
colony&semi; the <-> rder </-> <+> Order </+> in Council of 24 October 1860
which annexed the peninsula of Kowloon to the original colony&semi; and the
Order in Council of 20 October 1898 which added the New Territories to it .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#50:1>


<p> The Order in Council do no more than define the territorial boundaries of
the colony and the extent of the jurisdiction of the Governor and the
Legislative council .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#51:1>
<fnr> <sp> 8 </sp> </fnr> The basic framework of the administration
of Hong Kong is established by the <it> Letters Patent </it> and together
with the <it> Royal Instructions </it> passed under the <it> Royal Sign
Manual and Signet </it> which laid down the procedures that must be followed .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#52:1>
The details of the two documents will be discussed later . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#53:1>


<p> The Australian Constitutional development started with Governor Phillip
taking possession of eastern Australia on behalf of His Majesty the King ,
George III .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#54:1>
It became a civil colony when an Imperial Act established a
Legislative Council to advise the Governor .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#55:1>
Later after several times of separation of territories on the land ,
there are finally six colonies in Australia .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#56:1>
These six Colonies became the six &ldquo; Original States &rdquo; in
the Commonwealth when it was established on 1 January 1901 .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#57:1>
<fnr> <sp> 9 </sp> </fnr> As the government institutions evolved the
Colonies grew towards independence .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#58:1>
The Legislative Councils in New South Wales , Victoria , South
Australia and Van Diemen  ' s Land in the mid 1850s and in western Australia in
the late 1880s drafted Constitutions .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#59:1>
These were sent off to the Colonial Office in England for approval .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#60:1>
As mentioned above , at Federation on 1 January 1901 the former
colonies became States , keeping their Constitutions , laws , powers , Houses
of Parliament , courts and governments . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#61:1>


<p> Although the Federation was established in 1901 , it was not until 9 July
1900 the <it> Commonwealth of Australia constitution Act 1900 </it> was
enacted .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#62:1>


<ICE-HK:W1A-010#63:1>
<h> <it> <bold> III. Contents of the two Constitutions </bold> </it>
</h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#64:1>
<h> <bold> <it> Hong Kong </it> </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#65:1>
<h> <bold> <it> A. Letters Patent </it> </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#66:1>


<p> The Letters Patent are the earlier and more important document .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#67:1>
They create the office of Governor and Commander-in-chief of Hong
Kong and require him to observe laws and instructions given to him by the
Queen or the secretary of state .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#68:1>
They also deal with the constitution of the Executive and the
Legislative councils , the Governor  ' s powers in respect of legislation ,
disposal of land , the appointment of judges and public officers , pardons ,
and the tenure of office of Supreme Court and District Court judges .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#69:1>
<fnr> <sp> 10 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#70:1>
<h> <bold> <it> B. Royal Instructions </it> </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#71:1>


<p> The Royal Instructions deal  ' With the appointment of members of the
Executive and Legislative Councils , the nature of proceedings in the
Executive Council , the Governor  ' s responsibility to consult the Executive
council on important policy matters , and his right to act against its advice .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#72:1>
They also deal with the membership of and election to , the
legislative Council , the nature of proceedings there , and the nature of
legislation which may not be passed .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#73:1>
<fnr> <sp> 11 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#74:1>


<p> From these two documents it can be seen that the Hong Kong constitution
is indeed a very <it> short </it> and <it> simple </it> Constitution as very
wide powers is given to the Governor and the Legislative Council .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#75:1>
Matters that will usually be found in other constitutions are omitted .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#76:1>
For instance , the details of the organization of the Courts of Law ,
the Urban Council , and the District Boards are not given because their
structure and powers can be completely regulated by ordinances passed by the
Legislative Council .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#77:1>
Moreover , the Constitution does not provide for special emergency
powers as the Governor is given wide power to act at his own discretion ,
within the law , provided he reports the facts to London at once .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#78:1>
<fnr> <sp> 12 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#79:1>
<h> <bold> <it> Australia </it> </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#80:1>
<h> <bold> <it> Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 </it>
</bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#81:1>


<p> Here the document is divided into eight chapters .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#82:1>
Chapters I , II , and III make provisions for the legislature , the
executive and the judiciary .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#83:1>
The first part of Ch. I vests legislative power and goes on to detail
parliamentary machinery .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#84:1>
The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested formally in the
Queen and made exercisable by the Governor-General under the first section
&obrack; s. 61 &cbrack; in Ch. II of the Constitution .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#85:1>
Thereafter Ch. II prescribes some functions arid rules for an
exercise of the federal power .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#86:1>
The judicial power of the Commonwealth is vested in the High Court of
Australia and made available for other courts by the first section &obrack;
s. 71 &cbrack; in Ch. III . and jurisdictional provisions follow . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#87:1>


<p> Subsequently Ch. IV is about Finance and Trade , Ch. V the States , Ch.
VI the New States , Ch. VII Miscellaneous and Ch. VIII the Alteration of the
Constitution . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#88:1>


<p> It can be noticed that the Australian constitution is far more detailed
than the one in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#89:1>
Functions and powers of different branches of the government are set
out logically though not fully described .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#90:1>
One should be noted that there is a common feature between the two
Constitutions .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#91:1>
In both constitutions there is no provision of a Bill of Rights .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#92:1>
<h> <bold> <it> IV. Three Arms Of The Government </it> </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#93:1>


<p> In general theory the three arms of government , i.e. the legislature ,
the Executive and the judiciary , are separate from the other , separate in
personnel and function . <fnr> <sp> 13 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#94:1>
 Here we will take a look at the basic
structure of these three main parts of the two Governments . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#95:1>
<h> <bold> <it> Australia </it> </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#96:1>
<h> <bold> <ul> The Federal Parliament </ul> </bold> &obrack; The
Legislature &cbrack; </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#97:1>


<p> The Federal parliament , or &ldquo; The Parliament of the Commonwealth
&rdquo; as it is called in Ch. I of the Constitution , is a bicameral
law-making body .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#98:1>
The two chambers , the Upper and the Lower Houses , are the Senate
and the House of Representatives , with the third component of the Queen who
acts through the Governor-General . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#99:1>
<h> <bold> <it> <ul> i. The Senate </ul> </it> </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#100:1>


<p> The Upper House is elected directly by the people &obrack; S.7 of the
Constitution &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#101:1>
The President of the Senate is elected by the Senate &obrack; see
S.17 &cbrack; who is usually the senator backed by the majority political
parties in the Senate .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#102:1>
Generally speaking , the Senate was intended to be &ldquo; the
States  '  House &rdquo; , to represent the interests of the people of the
Several States as a federal device , and particularly to safeguard the small
States against the States of New South Wales and Victoria . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#103:1>


<p> The Senate has the same law-making powers as the House of Representatives
but for one important difference&semi; namely , &ldquo; money bills  '  i.e.
appropriation and taxation bills .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#104:1>
This limitation in money matters is one of the chief distinctions
between the Senate and the House of Representatives .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#105:1>
<fnr> <sp> 14 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#106:1>


<p> According to Lane , <fnr> <sp> 15 </sp> </fnr> the Senate as the Upper
House of Parliament has two functions .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#107:1>
Firstly it is often a house of review for the many bills coming up
from the main legislative chamber , the House of Representatives . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#108:1>


<p> Secondly , it is an investigating house .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#109:1>
Through its committed system the Senate keeps an eye on the
bureaucracy , on public spending and on public matters generally .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#110:1>
Through this system the Senate gathers source material for good
legislation <fnr> <sp> 16 </sp> </fnr> . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#111:1>
<h> <it> <ul> ii. The House Of Representatives </ul> </it> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#112:1>


<p> Similarly , the Lower House is elected directly by the People &obrack; S .
24 of the Constitution &cbrack; The Speaker , the principal officer of the
House , is elected by the House to preside over its meeting .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#113:1>
The Leader of the House is also a Government member , a senior
Minister .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#114:1>
He is appointed by the Prime Minister as his delegate to arrange
business of the House .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#115:1>
The Lower House has no general Committee system but multiple
Estimates Committees has been appointed since 1979 . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#116:1>


<p> In particular , the House of Representatives alone can introduce
appropriation and tax bills .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#117:1>
It also has almost exclusive power to amend these &ldquo; money
bills &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#118:1>
It has been given control of money because the Government of the day
is drawn predominantly from the members of the controlling party in this
House&semi; few of the Government  ' s Ministers sit in the Senate .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#119:1>
As a whole , the Lower House is indeed a stronger law-making body .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#120:1>
<h> <ul> <it> Hong Kong </it> </ul> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#121:1>
<h> <ul> <it> The Governor and the Legislative Council &obrack; The
Legislature &cbrack; </it> </ul> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#122:1>


<p> According to the Letters Patent s.7 &obrack; I &cbrack; , the authority
to make law for peace , order and good government of Hong Kong is granted to
the Governor , by and with the consent of the Legislative council .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#123:1>
LegCo cannot make primary legislation without the governor , who
cannot legislate without LegCo  ' s approval .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#124:1>
Unlike parliament , the LegCo is a unicameral body and does not
exist the democratic principle of direct elections for a majority or even a
minority of its members .

<ICE-HK:W1A-010#125:1>
<fnr> <sp> 17 </sp> </fnr> The chief functions Of the Council are to
enact laws , control public expenditure and put questions to the government
on matters of public interest . </p> </I>
