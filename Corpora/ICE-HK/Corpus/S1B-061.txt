<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-061#X81:1:Z>
<[> Could you </[> </{> could you also looked at page eight uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-061#86:1:A>

O six <{> <[> o </[> three two six is the same salesman

It it it looks like someone  ' s changed their mind about purchasing

But you can see the <{> <[> identical </[> figures as they are

<ICE-HK:S1B-061#X92:1:Z>

Do you agree <O> Cantonese translation </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-061#101:1:A>
But you cannot <,> I I <O>  ' you cannot I I ' overlap  ' le gouh'

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-061#X102:1:Z>
Uh if uh that is a record in in manual record then certainly

<{> <[> All Right </[>

<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-061#106:1:A>

in P twenty six <O> Cantonese translation and answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-061#X107:1:Z>
Uh because P twenty six uh is for day shift </X> <O> Cantonese
answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-061#X108:1:Z>
However if you check the time here eighteen fifty nine then it  ' s
must be uh night shift time </X> <&> A long pause </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-061#109:1:A>
Yes but uh I think in comparison if you look at uh P four for
the transaction of

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-061#X110:1:Z>
P four </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-061#111:1:A>
P four <O> Cantonese translation </O>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-061#X112:1:Z>
Okay </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-061#113:1:A>
Uh or the transaction on the ninth <O> Cantonese translation
</O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-061#114:1:A>
And uh for time entries seventeen seventeen and seventeen
twenty <O> Cantonese translation and answer </O> <&> A long pause </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-061#115:1:A>
<{> <[> They are </[> exactly reversal of numbers do you

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-061#X116:1:Z>
<[> Yeah they </[> </{> </X> <O> Cantonese translation </O>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-061#X117:1:Z>
<.> Ye ye </.> yes </X> <O> Cantonese translation and answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-061#X118:1:Z>
Yes correct </X>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-061#X119:1:Z>
Oh oh oh yes no no no that  ' s salesman something that the invoice
are two different invoices and that was again there was </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-061#120:1:A>
So <{> <[> it </[> seems that by looking just on page four
you can be pretty certain that there are mistakes about that

<ICE-HK:S1B-061#X121:1:Z>
<[> Yes </[> </{> </X> <O> Cantonese translation and answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-061#X122:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-061#123:1:A>
But you can't be so certain when you just look at uhm P

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-061#X124:1:Z>
Can you so certain P twenty eight yeah </X> <O> Cantonese
translation and answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-061#X125:1:Z>
Uh cannot be certain of what </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-061#126:1:A>
That there are cancellations for the same transaction <O>
Cantonese translation and answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-061#X127:1:Z>
Uh there are only two reasons for negative figures </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-061#128:1:A>
No I  ' m not now asking you to comment for the reason but uh
for the certainty

<ICE-HK:S1B-061#129:1:A>
You are not so certain in comparison <O> Cantonese translation and
answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-061#X130:1:Z>
I believe uh it  ' s very probable that uh the two <,> entries
cancel each other because they were handled by the same salesman </X> <O>
Cantonese answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-061#X131:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1B-061#X132:1:Z>
And same amount </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-061#133:1:A>
What I was suggesting perhaps you missed the point is that
the degree of certainty is not that as you can see on uh page on P four <O>
Cantonese translation and answer </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-061#134:1:A>
Because they had no intervening transactions <O>  ' Because
