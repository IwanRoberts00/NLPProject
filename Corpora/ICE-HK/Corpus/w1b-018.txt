concerned about other people . </p>

I wonder if you know any friends and owners of factories who would
like to give donations .

<ICE-HK:W1B-018#182:10>
At present we are in need of Professional Development fund to
sponsor young teachers to go overseas to gain experiences in the learning of
teaching techniques of the Deaf .

<ICE-HK:W1B-018#183:10>
For the recent 3 years we have quite a big turnover rate of
teachers migrating overseas .

<ICE-HK:W1B-018#184:10>
There is a Professional Conference run by the Alexander Graham Bell
Association of the Deaf in Rochester , U.S.A .

<ICE-HK:W1B-018#185:10>
We would like to send 3 teachers of different sections &obrack;
Preparatory , Primary and Secondary &cbrack; to broaden their minds and to
learn the teaching method of the Profoundly Deaf .

<ICE-HK:W1B-018#186:10>
We find this Conference and Working Seminar is most helpful to the
teachers and beneficial to the students .

<ICE-HK:W1B-018#187:10>
Enclosed please find the Estimated expenses per teacher for your
reference and kind assistance . </p>

Knowing that you maintain a wide range of contact with the
public I venture to write to you to see if any of your friends will be
generous enough to sponsor our request for donations for air-conditioners .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-018#205:11>
Our Reprovisioning Project has just been completed .

<ICE-HK:W1B-018#206:11>
As the site is situated in a squatter factories area , we often
suffer from the thick , black smoke issued from their factories .

<ICE-HK:W1B-018#207:11>
The secondary block is facing the chimneys and suffer most .

<ICE-HK:W1B-018#208:11>
The assembly hall has also the same problem .

<ICE-HK:W1B-018#209:11>
Therefore , we are in urgent need of air-conditioners to be
installed in the classrooms of the secondary block and the hall .

<ICE-HK:W1B-018#210:11>
We need a total of 40 units of air-conditioners , with wiring and
power supply .

<ICE-HK:W1B-018#211:11>
The total cost is HK&dollar;300,000 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-018#212:11>
I should be most grateful if some of your friends will respond to
our appeal .

<ICE-HK:W1B-018#213:11>

Dear Sir ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-018#274:14>
I refer to your instruction regarding the driving route .

<ICE-HK:W1B-018#275:14>
It is very very dangerous to drive across Hammer Hill Road then
turn to Wan Tung Street <O> Chinese-characters </O> as the road junction is
most dangerous , for the traffic flowing from the north is in very rapid
speed .

<ICE-HK:W1B-018#276:14>
Some school drivers dare not to take the risk at all .

<ICE-HK:W1B-018#277:14>
Therefore , for the safety of our students I would like to suggest
that signal lights can be installed beside the traffic lights in front of our
school to enable 2 cars crossing the Hammer Hill Road at a time .

<ICE-HK:W1B-018#278:14>
It seemed this is the most safe method .

<ICE-HK:W1B-018#279:14>
If you demand the drivers to drive round the Po Kong Village Road
back to Choi Hung it will increase a very high cost to the students and the
parents will be in troubles . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-018#280:14>
I should be most grateful if my suggestion could be accepted .

<ICE-HK:W1B-018#281:14>
Thank you for your kind attention . </p>

Chinese-characters </O> and her family .

<ICE-HK:W1B-018#373:19> Recently , we have been informed by Po-chi  ' s mother that they have
decided to make a request to your Department for a resettlement into a bigger
housing unit in Tsz Wan Shan whereas a redevelopment programme is undergoing
in the district . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-018#374:19> According to Madam LAM , Po-chi has found difficulties in her
study at home because of the overcrowding living condition .

<ICE-HK:W1B-018#375:19> The fact is , she doesn't even have a proper study desk for herself .

<ICE-HK:W1B-018#376:19> Her study at home is disturbed by the family routines since there
is not enough space .

<ICE-HK:W1B-018#377:19> She has to keep on moving from one spot to another in the flat .

<ICE-HK:W1B-018#378:19> Madam LAM believes that a bigger flat can provide more space for
her daughter so that , Po-chi can better concentrate on her study . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-018#379:19> In view of the situation of this family and for the benefit of
Po-chi , we do hope that you will offer help to them and take this request
into your special consideration . </p>
