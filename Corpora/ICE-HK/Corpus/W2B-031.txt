<ICE-HK:W2B-031#4:1>
Hong Kong-based wireless data communications provider Leadtone
Wireless is to offer real-time mobile e-mail services in the SAR . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#5:1>
The service , called Push Email , runs on the messaging layer of a
global system for mobile communications &obrack;  GSM &cbrack; mobile network . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#6:1>
While short messaging services &obrack;  SMS &cbrack; have a length limitation of
160 English letters or 70 Chinese characters , Leadtone said it had no size
limit theoretically . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#7:1>
Leadtone plans to launch the service by April in partnership with
local telecommunications operators Sunday and SmarTone Telecommunications .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#8:1>
Herbert Chang , Leadtone  ' s chairman and chief executive , said
the service would be the first of its kind in the region . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#9:1>
Japan  ' s biggest mobile-phone operator NTT DoCoMo offers similar
services through its i-mode mobile Internet-access service , which has about
30 million subscribers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#10:1>
Mr Chang said this demonstrated the huge potential of the wireless
data market . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#11:1>
The system is now available on Handspring  ' s Visor Phone and Treo .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#12:1>
It will be available on other wireless devices and mobile phones in
the coming months . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#13:1>
The company said the service would cost HK&dollar;2 per e-mail .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#14:1>
Mr Chang was optimistic that as much as 5 per cent of Hong Kong GSM
users would subscribe to the service . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#15:1>
The company has been in talks with China Mobile and China Unicom
to deliver similar services to the mainland at a lower rate . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#16:1>
Cahners In-Stat Group forecast the number of wireless data
subscribers in the world would grow from 400 million last year to 1.4 billion
in 2004 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#17:1>
International Data Corp &obrack;  IDC &cbrack; predicted that in Asia-Pacific ,
excluding Japan , the number of wireless data subscribers would climb from
about 59.7 million last year to about 153.9 million in 2005 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#18:1>
Mobile data revenues were expected to rise from about US&dollar;1.5
billion last year to about US&dollar;8.82 billion in 2005 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#19:1>
Davina Yeo , mobile e-business manager at IDC , said: &ldquo;
More than 75 per cent of the total wireless data users in 2001 were actually
SMS users .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#20:1>
This of course drops throughout the forecast period as more users
adopt the wireless data services other than text messaging and we see
commercialised 2.5G and &obrack;  third-generation &cbrack; services become more popular .
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#21:1>
But Ms Yeo said e-mail was a service many consumers wanted but
few would pay for , unlike in the corporate world where e-mail had become an
essential tool . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#22:1>
&ldquo; To consumers , many have been bred on the free e-mail
mentality because of Yahoo ! Mail and Hotmail so getting them to pay for
wireless access might be difficult , &rdquo; she said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#23:1>
&ldquo; Currently , those services that are making money are
still those rudimentary services like logo and ring-tone downloads .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#24:1>
I think location-based services &obrack;  LBS &cbrack; , which capitalise on
personalisation , will be an important driver . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#25:1>
&ldquo; However , LBS is still not widely used at the moment .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#26:1>
As to what will be the hottest among consumers is difficult to say
because consumers span the entire spectrum from young to working adults to
socialites etc , each with their own lifestyle patterns and each demanding a
separate set of functionalities from the wireless Web . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#31:2>
The number of fibre-optic broadband subscribers in Hong Kong is
set to grow from 25,250 last year to about 700,000 by 2006 , with market
revenue rising from US&dollar;116.82 million to US&dollar;3.48 billion ,
according to International Data Corp . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#32:2>
Metro Ethernet broadband services , based on fibre-optic networks
, provide a maximum bandwidth of one gigabit per second , while traditional
ADSL &obrack;  asymmetric digital subscriber line &cbrack; and cable modem broadband services
offer a bandwidth of three megabits per second to six Mbps . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#33:2>
&ldquo; With highly scalable bandwidth potential , metro Ethernet
services are considered by many to be the broadband ideal , &rdquo; said
Renee Gamble , IDC  ' s market analyst for communications research . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#34:2>
The technology runs on a metropolitan area network and is
marketed as an alternative to leased line services . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#35:2>
In Hong Kong , Hutchison Global Crossing and New World Telephone
have already launched premium bandwidth services and a range of lower
bandwidth alternatives which better suit small and medium-sized enterprises
and the residential market . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#36:2>
Their growth has subsequently persuaded Pacific Century
CyberWorks to offer a similar range of services . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#37:2>
Ms Gamble said CyberWorks would be ready to launch its services
later this year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#38:2>
She said Hong Kong was well networked by fibre , which made the
service commercially viable .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#39:2>
&ldquo; Its high-density housing and commercial building developments
make provisioning of fibre-optic connections highly scalable , &rdquo; she
said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#40:2>
The decision by three of Hong Kong  ' s four fixed-line providers
to enter the market owed much to Government policies that encouraged
competition , she said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#41:2>
&ldquo; For two such providers , metro Ethernet services are
their broadband service focus and they are working hard to gain market share
, &rdquo; Ms Gamble said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#42:2>
IDC forecasts that the number of metro Ethernet subscribers in
the Asia-Pacific region , excluding Japan , will increase from just 280,000
last year to 9.29 million in 2006 , with a compound annual growth rate of 110
per cent .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#43:2>
The market , worth US&dollar;395.34 million last year , was expected
to reach about US&dollar;1.5 billion this year and US&dollar;19.44 billion in
2006 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#44:2>
IDC predicts revenue from the China market will grow from
US&dollar;39.09 million to US&dollar;1.1 billion over that time , with
subscriber numbers increasing from 132,000 to 3.85 million . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#45:2>
&ldquo; China currently dominates the region in terms of
subscribers and will continue to do so throughout our forecast period ,
&rdquo; Ms Gamble said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#46:2>
&ldquo; All the major service providers in China are vying for
the metro Ethernet market . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#47:2>
&ldquo; Because of the tremendous level of infrastructure
development ongoing across China , the laying of fibre is more economical
than in other more developed areas - service providers are not needing to dig
up roads to lay fibre , but are working with developers to install fibre at
the same time . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#48:2>
Ms Gamble estimated that at China  ' s current rate of expansion ,
at least 150 cities would have optical-fibre network access by the end of
last year or early this year , which would compete against ADSL and cable
modem technologies . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#49:2>
Networking equipment company Unisphere Networks said many cities
in China were deploying metro Ethernet networks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#50:2>
Andrew Coward , the company  ' s Asia-Pacific vice-president of
engineering , said the system would become common in Hong Kong over the next
four years as it was high-speed and easy to use . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#51:2>
&ldquo; Every PC has Ethernet built in , &rdquo; Mr Coward said .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#52:2>
&ldquo; Everybody knows how to plug in an Ethernet cable .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#53:2>
A lot of people know how to turn on the Ethernet connection in their
PCs . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#54:2>
&ldquo; All of these factors mean that it is easier to get people
to use Ethernet , rather than ATM &obrack;  asynchronous transfer mode &cbrack; , frame relay
, ISDN &obrack;  integrated services digital network &cbrack; or some other solutions that
people have some fear about . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#55:2>
&ldquo; When a service provider gives you a socket in the wall
which is the network , then allows you to configure it yourself through a Web
browser , it is going to have a very high acceptance , particularly among
small-business people , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#59:3>
Application server software maker Citrix Systems has relocated
its regional headquarters to Hong Kong from Sydney as part of its Asian
expansion plans . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#60:3>
The Hong Kong office will oversee operations in China , Taiwan ,
Hong Kong , South Korea , India , Singapore , the Philippines , Malaysia ,
Indonesia , Thailand and Vietnam . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#61:3>
With a strong customer base already in Hong Kong , Dennis Rose ,
vice-president for Asia at Citrix , said it was an easy decision to choose
Hong Kong as a regional headquarters .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#62:3>
The company saw Hong Kong as a future gateway to the potentially huge
China market . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#63:3>
Citrix is a Nasdaq-listed thin-client software vendor , which
allows companies to run their allocations from a server , rather than the
traditional fat-client computing or mainframe model that requires computer
devices with high processing power . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#64:3>
&ldquo; We allow end-users to take applications - it can be
Windows applications , Java , Unix - into one phrase rather than hundreds of
personal computers , &rdquo; said Mr Rose . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#65:3>
He said the company  ' s core application serving technology ,
Independent Computing Architecture &obrack;  ICA &cbrack; , also ran on wireless devices and
&ldquo; delivered server-based computing of any application on any devices on
any network" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#66:3>
Mr Rose said ICA did not require much disc memory .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#67:3>
&ldquo; It can basically run on Pentium III or Pentium 4 servers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#68:3>
It enables people to have access to their applications over very
small bandwidth like 10 to 20 kilobytes per second , which is typical in the
GSM connectivity space . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#69:3>
Mr Rose said there had been at least nine million ICA licences
installed and shared by 35 million users since the system was introduced in
1995 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#70:3>
Citrix also has offices in Singapore and India .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#71:3>
It is due to open offices in Kuala Lumpur and Seoul in April . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#72:3>
The company reported revenue grew from US&dollar;470.4 million in
2000 to US&dollar;591.6 million last year .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#73:3>
Its Asia-Pacific operations , including Japan , Australia and New
Zealand , saw annual revenue growth of 60 per cent . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#74:3>
The Korean market is particularly strong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#75:3>
A report by International Data Corp said the Korean market for system
infrastructure software was forecast to grow from US&dollar;177.4 million in
1999 to US&dollar;411.5 million in 2004 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#76:3>
Asian clients include Pohang Iron and Steel , the world  ' s
biggest steel producer , and wireless devices developer Cyberbank , which
plans to start shipping a palmtop device - PC-Ephone - this quarter which
runs on Citrix  ' s application serving software MetaFrame . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#77:3>
Mr Rose said: &ldquo; The E-phone of Cyberbank is a very good
example of Citrix  ' s licensing applications .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#78:3>
Users can have their phones as devices to connect to servers running
on Windows , Java or Unix applications . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#79:3>
In Hong Kong , Citrix helped Midland Realty implement a server-
based computing system after its merger with Hong Kong Property Service
Holdings .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#80:3>
The new system centralised all data among branch offices and reduced
the bandwidth requirement .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#81:3>
The leased line costs were decreased from HK&dollar;15 million in
1999 to HK&dollar;5 million this year . </p>

<bold> In a bid to stem Linux  ' s popularity , Microsoft has allowed
the mainland controlled access to its codes </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#84:4>
<bold> Sidney Luk </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#85:4>
Just days after Bill Gates ' high-profile visit to Beijing last
week to promote Microsoft  ' s Windows , a survey shows the United States
software giant  ' s flagship product is losing ground to open-source operating
systems such as Linux . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#86:4>
The International Data Corp &obrack;  IDC &cbrack; survey found that 95 per cent
of mainland enterprises had Windows running on their desktops and laptops
while 4 per cent were using Linux . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#87:4>
Meanwhile , 63 per cent of servers were operating on Windows and
3 per cent on Linux . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#88:4>
But Linux usage in a client operating environment would grow 39
per cent year on year , compared with 11 per cent for Windows , the survey
found .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#89:4>
Linux server usage would increase by 41 per cent and Windows by just
8 per cent . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#90:4>
While Windows was not expected to lose its grip in the next few
years , IDC research manager for software Andrew Chew said: &ldquo; Microsoft
is not going to take this Linux development lightly . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#91:4>
&ldquo; There may yet be a shift in Microsoft  ' s pricing and
product positioning to keep Linux at bay . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#92:4>
Microsoft chairman Mr Gates was in Beijing last week to sign a
Government Security Programme agreement , allowing China controlled access to
the Windows source code and other technical data . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#93:4>
Market watchers saw this as a move by Microsoft to stem the
popularity of open-source and cheaper software such as Linux . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#94:4>
The Ministry of Information Industry set up an open-source
alliance last year , showing its support for Linux-based systems .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#95:4>
Government departments in Beijing and Guangdong have awarded
contracts to Linux vendors in the past year , including Red Flag , Thiz and
Kingsoft . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#96:4>
&ldquo; It is unlikely that the Microsoft agreement will make a
difference in the Chinese government  ' s support for Linux , &rdquo; Mr Chew
said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#97:4>
&ldquo; The agreement will only superficially help solve some of
the security concerns that the government has . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#98:4>
&ldquo; Other concerns that are likely to remain are the question
of total transparency and the high cost of time and manpower needed to fully
understand the codes . &rdquo; </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#101:5>
In a quest for long-term viability after the bursting of the
Internet bubble , hongkong.com has been moving away from the provision of
content and mail services and switched focus to the mainland  ' s wireless
population . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#102:5>
Earlier this week , the Growth Enterprise Market-listed
subsidiary of Chinadotcom completed the purchase of mainland short messaging
service &obrack;  SMS &cbrack; developer Newpalm &obrack;  China &cbrack; Information Technology , after
reviewing more than 50 acquisition opportunities last year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#103:5>
The company said the Newpalm move was its first expansion into
China .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#104:5>
Unlike other mobile service providers , Newpalm is more focused on
community services such as mobile chatting and dating rather than ringtone
and content downloads . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#105:5>
&ldquo; The margins of those downloads are not particularly high
, which is why we haven't pushed those items , &rdquo; said hongkong.com
chief executive Rudy Chan Kai-yu . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#106:5>
Mr Chan said Newpalm would bring in more than HK&dollar;20
million in revenue this quarter and contribute more than 50 per cent of
revenue for the whole year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#107:5>
The market was encouraged by the announcement .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#108:5>
The counter was heavily traded , with 36.9 million shares changing
hands , and closed up 46 per cent on the week at 38 HK cents . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#109:5>
While some brokers expressed doubts that the price paid , no
more than US&dollar;55 million , was a bit expensive for a mainland software
maker , Mr Chan said that it was reasonable , based on a 10-times
price-to-earnings ratio , and hongkong.com did not mind paying up if Newpalm
could generate more revenue . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#110:5>
Mr Chan said he was very confident that community chat rooms ,
where people develop friendships , was a better business than ringtone and
news downloads , because no content was needed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#111:5>
Subscribers are charged five yuan &obrack;  about HK&dollar;4.71 &cbrack; a
month to join the communities and they need to pay for every SMS they send as
they communicate with their new friends . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#112:5>
It is a lucrative business on the mainland .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#113:5>
China Mobile takes 15 per cent of SMS revenue raised and China
Unicom takes 12 per cent while Newpalm holds the rest . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#114:5>
The number of mobile users in China grew to 216.39 million in
February from 155.85 million a year ago , according to the Ministry of
Information Industry .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#115:5>
A Pyramid Research report estimated that SMS revenues hit about
US&dollar;750 million last year and predicted they would reach US&dollar;16
billion by 2007 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#116:5>
&ldquo; It makes sense that some of the portals - if they don't
have a strong SMS or online gaming base - purchase some of the smaller
up-and-coming companies , &rdquo; said International Data Corp &obrack;  IDC &cbrack; senior
Internet analyst Nathan Midler . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#117:5>
&ldquo; There is going to be a lot of growth of SMS for quite a
while .

<ICE-HK:W2B-031#118:5>
What drives this growth is the number of people who keep coming
online . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#119:5>
IDC has forecast the Internet population on the mainland will
grow from 48.5 million last year to 68.3 million this year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#120:5>
Wireless solutions have not only provided remarkable revenue ,
they have also helped China  ' s big three Internet portals - Sina , Sohu and
NetEase - to return to the black after years of losses on the poorly
performing Nasdaq stock market . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#121:5>
However , Mr Midler warned the portals should start developing
something else before the SMS bandwagon lost momentum . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#122:5>
&ldquo; They can look into search engines and start up a similar
model to Google , which is extremely successful in the United States and is
changing the way people perceive search engines and the inspiration behind
money-making &obrack;  opportunities &cbrack; , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#123:5>
The US search engine carries out 200 million Internet searches a
day . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#124:5>
As a private company , it does not disclose its figures but
analysts estimate its revenue has reached more than US&dollar;500 million a
year , with operating profit margins of more than 30 per cent . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-031#125:5>
&ldquo; The three portals need to focus on areas . . . like
online travel and gaming , &rdquo; Mr Midler said . </p>
