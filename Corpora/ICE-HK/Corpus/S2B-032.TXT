<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-032#1:1:A>
It  ' s nearly a fortnight since I presented my sixth and final
budget to the Legislative Council

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#2:1:A>
It was perhaps the most difficult I have had to prepare <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#3:1:A>
Why do I say that

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#4:1:A>
First let me rewind to late nineteen ninety-seven when Hong Kong was
swept up in the Asian financial crisis

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#5:1:A>
The powerful economic growth we had seen for many years suddenly
evaporated

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#6:1:A>
Hong Kong was plunged into its only recession in living memory

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#7:1:A>
It was a traumatic time for many in the community

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#8:1:A>
By the middle of nineteen ninety nine the tide had turned and last
year our economy bounced back dramatically to register the highest growth for
more than a decade <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#9:1:A>
I know statistics don't tell the whole story

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#10:1:A>
I know there  ' re people who are still suffering

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#11:1:A>
I recognise there are some who have not yet fully benefited from
the recovery

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#12:1:A>
For many the past few years had been quite difficult

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#13:1:A>
Wages have been frozen or even reduced

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#14:1:A>
Some of our fellow citizens have lost their jobs

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#15:1:A>
Household incomes have fallen

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#16:1:A>
Family budgets have been stretched and people have had to cut back
on their spending

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#17:1:A>
The government  ' s income has also fallen <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#18:1:A>
But things are getting better

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#19:1:A>
This year wages should start to pick up modestly

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#20:1:A>
The unemployment level is edging down and should continue to fall
although it is still high by Hong Kong standards

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#21:1:A>
But I think it is well to remember that at the height of the
economic setback when people were acutely worried about their future and with
good reason <,> we deliberately did not cut back on our spending

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#22:1:A>
We pushed ahead with our plans to help the economy recover and
reduce the financial burden of our people and to help them ride out the storm
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#23:1:A>
During that difficult time we cut rates

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#24:1:A>
We reduced tax burdens for most families

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#25:1:A>
We introduced a one hundred thousand tax deduction for mortgage
holders

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#26:1:A>
We increased tax deductions for those people looking after sick or
elderly relatives

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#27:1:A>
In mid nineteen ninety eight we took the unprecedented step of
bringing out a mini-budget

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#28:1:A>
All of these measures were taken to relieve the hardship of
ordinary Hong Kong people facing an extraordinary and unexpected economic
setback

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#29:1:A>
Although the economy has turned around the government finances are
still not as healthy as they were before the crisis

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#30:1:A>
Our day- to-day spending still exceeds our day-to-day income

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#31:1:A>
I don't have to tell any Hong Kong householder what this means in
real life

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#32:1:A>
In preparing this budget I could not ignore any of these factors

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#33:1:A>
I was also determined to follow the principles of sound financial
management that have been the foundation of Hong Kong  ' s great post-war
success

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#34:1:A>
I had to strike a sensible balance between Government spending and
Government income

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#35:1:A>
Should we spend more and raise taxes to pay for extra spending <,>
or should we hold down expenditure and avoid tax increases altogether

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#36:1:A>
Holding down spending would deprive the less fortunate members of
our community of the help they need

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#37:1:A>
Raising taxes would strike hardest at the middle-income earners who
have seen their property values fall and in some cases drift into negative
equity

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#38:1:A>
The economic recovery has taken root but we need to let those roots
spread and grow stronger

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#39:1:A>
To help this happen I have chosen to take the middle ground with a
deliberately conservative budget

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#40:1:A>
Still government spending will grow by two and half per cent in
real terms over the level planned a year ago

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#41:1:A>
This will provide an extra five billion dollars for day-to-day
services

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#42:1:A>
On top of this an extra two billion dollars will be available
because of the determined efforts of my colleagues in the civil service to
save money under the enhanced productivity programme

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#43:1:A>
In all we will have an extra seven billion no small sum to
introduce new services or to expand and improve existing ones

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#44:1:A>
More to the point we are spending this extra money where it is
needed most

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#45:1:A>
To improve primary and secondary schooling to provide better
services for the elderly and the disabled to help youths at risk of going
astray

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#46:1:A>
And I want to emphasise this to provide more training and
retraining to equip our workforce with the knowledge and skills needed in the
twenty-first century <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#47:1:A>
Of course there is another side to the equation we have to find the
money to pay for most of this extra spending

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#48:1:A>
To help us do this I have put forward only a handful of modest
increases in taxes and charges

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#49:1:A>
I quite deliberately chose not to increase salaries or profits tax
rates or reduce salaries tax allowances

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#50:1:A>
The few increases I  ' ve proposed have been carefully devised so
they will not affect people  ' s basic livelihood nor prejudice our economic
growth <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#51:1:A>
In any community there will always be demands to spend more on this
or that to cut taxes or to increase tax deductions

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#52:1:A>
And where they see a large pool of money in our fiscal reserves
some people will argue that we should forget about living within our means
and use it to bridge the gap between our income and expenditure

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#53:1:A>
I beg to differ

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#54:1:A>
Last year the community earned more than twenty three billion
dollars from the investment of our fiscal reserves

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#55:1:A>
This income is used to help finance our spending plans for the
coming year

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#56:1:A>
If we dig into our reserves then obviously the amount of money we
earn on them will decrease while our spending programmes will increase

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#57:1:A>
And at the end of that slippery slope we would have no more
reserves to invest

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#58:1:A>
Or God forbid no more reserves on which to call if we ever had to
face the same kind of financial crisis we did back in nineteen ninety-seven
and nineteen ninety eight

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#59:1:A>
In that case how could we pay our bills

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#60:1:A>
How could we defend our currency if it came under attack

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#61:1:A>
How in the face of any future economic setback could we maintain
our spending plans and offer relief to the community by reducing taxes as we
did in nineteen ninety eight

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#62:1:A>
A small externally-oriented economy like ours does not exist in a
vacuum

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#63:1:A>
We cannot be complacent <unc> 1 WORD </unc> about the
global economic outlook

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#64:1:A>
The uncertainties of a slowing US economy and a continuing economic
problems in Japan may have an impact on our nascent recovery

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#65:1:A>
Hong Kong has a hard earned reputation for prudent fiscal
management

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#66:1:A>
This would be lost if budget deficits became the norm and we drew
on our reserves to meet any shortfalls

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#67:1:A>
Investors would lose confidence

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#68:1:A>
Fewer businesses would set up in Hong Kong and existing businesses
would find it increasingly costly to raise the capital they need to expand

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#69:1:A>
Eventually this could lead to rising unemployment and falling
living standards for everyone <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#70:1:A>
Is it worth risking all this

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#71:1:A>
Paying less taxes now or spending more today may sound attractive

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#72:1:A>
But we would burden future generations with the bill for such
actions

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#73:1:A>
Is that fair

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#74:1:A>
And what about our Basic Law obligation to balance our books <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#75:1:A>
I won't take easy options just because it is the popular thing to
do

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#76:1:A>
As Financial Secretary I would be failing in my duty to you the
people of Hong Kong if I did not think about the long-term future of our
community

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#77:1:A>
That is why my last budget is one of balance </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-032#78:2:A>
Just four days ago the Chief Executive Mr C H Tung delivered
his fifth Annual Policy Address to the Legislative Council

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#79:2:A>
Since then the airwaves and newspaper columns have been filled with
a public debate on issues arising from the speech everything from housing and
employment to care for the elderly

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#80:2:A>
I want to focus today on just one aspect of Mr Tung  ' s address
because it has far-reaching implications for governance in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#81:2:A>
I refer to the Chief Executive  ' s thinking on the introduction of a
so-called accountability system in the way we are governed <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#82:2:A>
What exactly does it mean

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#83:2:A>
Surely the Hong Kong SAR Government is already accountable

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#84:2:A>
Indeed it is

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#85:2:A>
Under the Basic Law we have an executive-led government that is
accountable to the legislature

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#86:2:A>
But the idea set out by Mr Tung last Wednesday take this process an
important step forward

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#87:2:A>
He visualized this system more attuned to the notion of Hong Kong
people running Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#88:2:A>
The existing arrangements owe more to our colonial past than to the
high degree of autonomy we enjoy under One Country Two Systems

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#89:2:A>
What Mr Tung has suggested is the introduction of a new system of
appointment for the top echelon of government officials Chief Secretary the
Financial Secretary the Secretary for Justice and most Bureau Directors or
what we used to call Policy Secretaries

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#90:2:A>
This is a significant move and in my view a change for the better

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#91:2:A>
The proposal should be seen in a context of the developments that
have taken place since the Handover four and half years ago

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#92:2:A>
With Hong Kong people running Hong Kong the community has come to
expect a lot more from senior officials

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#93:2:A>
There is a demand for a high level of accountability

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#94:2:A>
People feel that as senior officials are involved in policy-making
and play a leading role in public affairs they should be held accountable for
the outcome of their policies

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#95:2:A>
This is entirely understandable

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#96:2:A>
At present the top three Secretaries and Directors of Bureaux are
permanent civil servants

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#97:2:A>
As such they are held responsible for administrative and managerial
mishaps and for personal misconduct

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#98:2:A>
They are subject to a well-established civil service appointment
management and disciplinary system

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#99:2:A>
But there is increasing pressure for top civil servants to assume
political responsibility for the success or failure of their policies

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#100:2:A>
This is not appropriate under the present employment terms for
civil servants

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#101:2:A>
It would in any event undermine the political neutrality of our
civil service system which is one of the cornerstones of Hong Kong  ' s success

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#102:2:A>
At the same time I  ' m acutely conscious of the rapidly expanding
workload of our senior colleagues as their roles have become less
administrative and more political

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#103:2:A>
In the past four years the intensity complexity and volume of
their work have increased exponentially

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#104:2:A>
Their tasks involve not only policy formulation in the politically
neutral sense they must also argue for their proposals in a partisan
legislature promote and defend them through the media and interface with the
public

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#105:2:A>
The sheer volume of this work is becoming insurmountable

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#106:2:A>
It is time to take steps to address the situation <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#107:2:A>
Introducing a new system of appointment for the senior officials
outside the civil service is a logical way to proceed

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#108:2:A>
Under the Chief Executive  ' s proposals the top three Secretaries
and most Directors of Bureaux will be public officials rather than civil
servants as we understand the term in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#109:2:A>
They will be appointed on the nomination of the Chief Executive
and will be responsible to him

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#110:2:A>
They comprise a new political decision-making layer which at a
stroke will also have the effect of preserving the neutrality of the civil
service

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#111:2:A>
Such a system will provide greater flexibility in filling these
positions with suitable candidates identified from both within the civil
service and the private sector

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#112:2:A>
Their roles powers and responsibilities vis-a-vis civil servants
will be clearly defined <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#113:2:A>
In practice policy formulation and political responsibility will
fall to the three Secretaries and Directors of Bureaux whereas public
administration and managerial responsibility will fall to civil servants

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#114:2:A>
This is the system that operates in most democratic countries

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#115:2:A>
The three Secretaries and Directors of Bureaux will be appointed
to the Executive Council our highest policy- making body

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#116:2:A>
This will enable them to take part collectively in a more
conventional cabinet-style system where policies decided <,> priorities
relating to policy and legislative initiatives are set and the allocation of
government resources as a whole are made

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#117:2:A>
In this setting they will be able to see how their proposals
interlock with those of other Principal Officials and will make for better
coordination of decisions that cut across different policy and operational
areas of the government

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#118:2:A>
More important all of this will place the Principal Officials in a
better position to interact and cooperate with members of the legislature and
to secure their support

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#119:2:A>
Under these arrangements Principal Officials will have to shoulder
full political responsibility for their respective portfolios for better or
for worse

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#120:2:A>
There would certainly be every incentive for them to listen to the
public  ' s views more carefully consider them positively ensure that their
policies are in tune with public sentiments and see that the delivery of
services meets the public approval

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#121:2:A>
Unlike permanent civil servants the term of office of these
officials will not exceed that of the Chief Executive who nominates their
appointment

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#122:2:A>
This will have the advantage of concentrating their minds to
achieve optimal results before the end of their term of office

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#123:2:A>
In the unfortunate and I hope unlikely event of any grave mishaps
the harsh glare of public scrutiny will come into play

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#124:2:A>
The new system will provide the necessary flexibility for timely
and appropriate remedial measures to be taken

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#125:2:A>
It will also help to minimize the risk of politicizing the civil
service

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#126:2:A>
It will ensure that the integrity of the civil service management
system is maintained and the strengths of a permanent professional neutral
and meritocratic civil service are preserved

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#127:2:A>
With this unambiguous division of responsibilities I am confident
that the culture of enhanced accountability will not only be strengthened at
the senior echelons of government but will permeate down the hierarchy and
throughout the civil service

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#128:2:A>
It will bring a new approach to policy-making a more responsive
and responsible government and a greater degree of accountability

<ICE-HK:S2B-032#129:2:A>
This can only be good for Hong Kong </I>
