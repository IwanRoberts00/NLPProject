<I>

<$A> <#1:1:A> Mr Deputy President <,> I thank the Governor for his speech <,>
<#2:1:A> In particular I welcome his statements on the future of the Legco
<,>
<#3:1:A> Hong Kong is indeed entering a crucial time <,> and we at Legco have
a vital contribution to make <,>
<#4:1:A> This contribution can best be made in a spirit of co-operation <,> a
will to work together <,> openly and honestly to achieve consensus <,>
<#5:1:A> For the first time in the history of Hong Kong <,> directly elected
representatives of the people <,> are able to participate fully in the work
of this council <,>
<#6:1:A> I hope that we Legco members can demonstrate to the people of Hong
Kong the PRC Government <,> and indeed the whole world by the work that we do
in the next four years <,> that we can make a success of democratic reforms
<,> and that further gradual changes in this direction <,> are beneficial to
the future of Hong Kong and China <,>
<#7:1:A> Let us win the recognition of the PRC Government <,> by our actions
<#8:1:A> I  ' m glad to hear the Governor say that the work of the JLG will be
speeded up and that it is expected the function in the coming year <,> with a
new impetus and sense of purpose <,>
<#9:1:A> I understand that there remain many outstanding issues which need to
be resolved in the remaining period of the run-up to nineteen ninety-seven
<#10:1:A> I trust that the spirit of co-operation prevails there too <,>
<#11:1:A> What is needed is a situation <,> where each side explain its own
views and listens to the views of the other side with tolerance and
understanding
<#12:1:A> I firmly believe that the key to success in the talks within the
JLG <,> is the willingness on both sides to work together <,> towards a
convergence of ideas <,,>
<#13:1:A> Whilst I  ' m assured by the Governor  ' s statement on the progress of
the talks <,> I have some concerns that the views of the people of Hong Kong
have not always been fully taken into account <,>
<#14:1:A> I appreciate the fact that under the terms of the JLG the general
public including this council <,> would not be consulted formally on its
deliberations <,>
<#15:1:A> However I sincerely hope that the government will give us an
assurance <,> that the interests and concerns of the people of Hong Kong <,>
are fully taken into account on all matters discussed <,>
<#16:1:A> I am disappointed with the handling of the matter of the Court of
Final Appeal <,> and hope that in future the JLG will be able to demonstrate
through its actions <,> that it has indeed taken full account of the views of
the Hong Kong people <,,>
<#17:1:A> I should like to talk for a moment about the economy <,>
<#18:1:A> Let us never lose sight of the fact that our future depends upon it
<,>
<#19:1:A> It is absolutely fundamental to the future success of Hong Kong <,>
that we continue to have a dynamic economy <,>
<#20:1:A> In the context of the one country two systems promised by China <,>
we must recognise that it is vital for Hong Kong to play a pivotal role in
the economy of China <,>
<#21:1:A> This will only be possible if we can sustain well beyond nineteen
ninety-seven the entrepreneurial spirit of the Hong Kong people <,> which has
brought us such great success up to now <,>
<#22:1:A> If we fail in this task <,> I fear that the rationale for Hong Kong
being able to operate a capitalistic system within a socialist country <,>
will be difficult to sustain <,>
<#23:1:A> For this reason <,> I believe that the economy must take precedence
in any changes to our society <,>
<#24:1:A> Further I agree with the Governor  ' s statement that increased
funding for social services <,> welfare and education <,> can only come from
further economic growth <,>
<#25:1:A> Accordingly we must work together to promote the continued growth
of our economy <,> for this will ultimately lead to the enrichment of our
society as a whole <,,>
<#26:1:A> A major concern about the well-being of our economy <,> in the
short to medium term is the threat to China  ' s most favoured nation status
vis-a-vis the United States of America <,>
<#27:1:A> Withdrawal by the USA of China  ' s status <,> would be extremely
damaging to Hong Kong <,>
<#28:1:A> In order to protect our own interests <,> we must exert our best
efforts <,> to facilitate the resolution of any problems and to remove any
obstacles <,> which could endanger China  ' s MFN status <,>
<#29:1:A> Hong Kong is now planning what is arguably the most ambitious plan
of development ever seen anywhere in the world <,>
<#30:1:A> Construction of the new port and airport are vital to our future
prosperity <,>
<#31:1:A> Quite apart from the additional inflationary pressures that these
enormous projects will generate <,> we simply do not have a workforce large
enough to cope with them within the time scale envisaged in the government  ' s
plan <,>
<#32:1:A> The importation of labour is a contentious issue <,> but I believe
that further extension of selected importation of labour under a carefully
control scheme <,> will not be detrimental to the interests of our local
workers and will be in the overall interest of the people of Hong Kong <,>
<#33:1:A> We need the development to facilitate our economic growth and we
need additional labour to undertake these massive construction works <,>
<#34:1:A> If we cannot provide that additional labour from our existing
resources the fact is that we shall have no option but to import it <,,>
<#35:1:A> Inflation continues to be a serious problem <,>
<#36:1:A> Although the recent statistics show a moderate fall in a rate of
inflation <,> it is still running at more than double the rate of most of our
trading partners <,>
<#37:1:A> Whilst others appear to be dealing with it with this problem we
clearly are not <,>
<#38:1:A> Hong Kong cannot tolerate this imbalance for long <,>
<#39:1:A> Whist inflation is obviously of particular concern to the less
well-off in our society <,> it is also very damaging for our economy <,>
<#40:1:A> Our competitiveness will be seriously eroded <,> if we are not able
to move quickly back into step with our competitors <,> our customers <,> and
the rest of the world <,>
<#41:1:A> Yesterday I <.> he </.> listened with interest to many comments
from my honourable colleagues about their assessment of the causes of
inflation in Hong Kong <,>
<#42:1:A> I  ' m sure some of these are correct <,>
<#43:1:A> I welcome the setting up of a task force <,> to identify the causes
of inflation and find remedies for it <,>
<#44:1:A> I urge government to take drastic action to deal with this problem
urgently <,>
<#45:1:A> I anticipate that such action may well be unpalatable to certain
sectors of our society <,>
<#46:1:A> Therefore I hope that this council will be fully consulted <,>
before the chosen remedies are implemented <,>
<#47:1:A> Apart from the well-being of our economy the one issue that will
best guarantee our future is the preservation of law and order <,>
<#48:1:A> These two issues are not unrelated <,> as I believe that any
deterioration in our economy <,> will lead to a corresponding deterioration
in the state of law and order <,>
<#49:1:A> I welcome the Governor  ' s assurance that he will not let standard
slip <,> but I would like to hear more concrete information about how exactly
the government plan to ensure this <,>
<#50:1:A> In particular I would like to know what contingency plans the
government has made in the event of any deterioration in the economy <,>
<#51:1:A> The recent surge of armed robberies is worrying <,> particularly
when the state of our economy is still fairly healthy
<#52:1:A> What would the situation be if we have a depression <,> with high
levels of unemployment <,> and a bleak economic outlook <,>
<#53:1:A> I understand the need to curb public spending in order to finance
our pubic infrastructure projects <,>
<#54:1:A> However I would like government  ' s assurance that adequate
resources <,> will be made available to the law enforcement agencies <,> so
that they can not merely maintain <,> but actually improve upon <,> the
present state of the preservation of law and order <,>
<#55:1:A> Finally I return to the point I made at the beginning <,>
<#56:1:A> The way forward is through goodwill and co-operation <,>
<#57:1:A> This council will only be able to inspire confidence in the people
of Hong Kong <,> if it is seen by them to act with integrity <,>
<#58:1:A> With these remarks I support the motion <O> several-speeches </O>
</I>


<I>

<$A> <#59:2:A> Mr Deputy President I would like to join the Chief Secretary
in thanking all members who have spoken on those subjects for which I am
responsible <,>
<#60:2:A> I will however confine my remarks to the Joint Liaison Group <,>
the Court of Final Appeal <,> and electoral and constitutional development
<,>
<#61:2:A> As the Governor has highlighted in his address to this council on
ninth October nineteen ninety-one <,> the management of our relations with
China is crucial <,> to achieving a smooth and successful transfer of
sovereignty in nineteen ninety-seven <,>
<#62:2:A> That more than half of the members of this council <,> spoke on
this theme <,> attests to the clear recognition of its importance now and in
the next six years <,>
<#63:2:A> I  ' m happy that with my recent appointment as the Secretary for
Constitutional Affairs I shall be able to contribute to this worthwhile goal
<,,>
<#64:2:A> Hong Kong is a pluralistic society <,>
<#65:2:A> It is entirely natural that different people have different views
<,> and express their own views forcefully <,> on <.> some </.> on something
so important <,> to our future as how to manage that relationship with our
future sovereign power <,>
<#66:2:A> But I cannot help noticing both from members  '  speeches <,> as well
as from public and media comments they generated <,> a broad consensus <,>
namely that relationship must be base on mutual understanding and
co-operation <,> grounded on the provisions of the Joint Declaration <,>
<#67:2:A> The Prime Minister  ' s recent visit to China <,> and the signing of
the Memorandum of Understanding on the Airport <,> underscores the key points
of that relationship <,> intensification of co-operation and consultation <,>
and reaffirmation of the determination to implement the Joint Declaration <,>
in letter and spirit <,>
<#68:2:A> Surely no lasting relationship <,> can be founded on mutual
suspicion and distrust <,>
<#69:2:A> If they exist <,> then we must do all we can to break them down <,>
<#70:2:A> We must take care to explain our views tactfully and <.> fi </.>
but firmly <,>
<#71:2:A> At the same time <,> we must listen to the other side with
understanding and patience <,>
<#72:2:A> The stakes are too high for us to do otherwise <,>
<#73:2:A> The Joint Liaison Group plays a key role in our consultation with
China on the implementation of the Joint Declaration <,>
<#74:2:A> Yet I fear that its role is sometimes misunderstood <,>
<#75:2:A> In the words of the Joint Declaration <,> it is and I quote <quote>
an organ for liaison and not an organ of power <X>
<#X76:2:A> It shall play no part in the administration of Hong Kong or the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
<#X77:2:A> Nor shall it have any supervisory role over that administration
</quote> </X>
<#78:2:A> End of quote <,>
<#79:2:A> There is no question of the JLG being a Sino-British condominium
government <,>
<#80:2:A> The administration of Hong Kong is firmly in the hands of the Hong
Kong Government <,>
<#81:2:A> It has sometimes been alleged that Britain and China have concluded
agreements on Hong Kong  ' s future in the joint Liaison Group behind our backs
<,>
<#82:2:A> This is patently untrue <,>
<#83:2:A> Hong Kong has a direct line to these consultations <,> both through
its Hong Kong membership in the Joint Liaison Group and through the Executive
Council <,>
<#84:2:A> The Executive Council is fully consulted on the preparation of the
British side  ' s objective and at every stage of the discussions <,>
<#85:2:A> The Governor  ' s recent appointments to the Executive Council <,>
should be seen in this context <,>
<#86:2:A> In making his new appointments the Governor was anxious to
strengthen the links between the Executive and the Legislative Councils <,>
<#87:2:A> All of his new appointees <,> are members of this council <,>
<#88:2:A> All will play their part <,> in representing the views of the Hong
Kong people <,> on vital issues affecting Hong Kong  ' s future <,>
<#89:2:A> It is perhaps appropriate at this stage that I refer to the
concerns raised by members of this council both before and during this debate
<,> on the Court of Final Appeal <,>
<#90:2:A> We are conscious of the strong views express so far <,>
<#91:2:A> There is <.> unders </.> this is understandable because the
continuation of an independent judicial system <,> is one of the <.> mo </.>
of the important safeguards for the future <,>
<#92:2:A> But I think we now need to stand back a little and reflect <,>
<#93:2:A> Public comments have so far focussed <,> on the composition of the
court <,>
<#94:2:A> This is unfortunate <,>
<#95:2:A> The composition of the court is only one aspect of a highly
valuable agreement <,>
<#96:2:A> We have sought in discussions with China <,> to achieve maximum
continuity <,> of an independent judicial system <,> including the vesting of
the power of final judgement in Hong Kong across nineteen ninety-seven <,>
<#97:2:A> This is of vital importance for confidence <,> for the people of
Hong Kong no less than for the business community <,>
<#98:2:A> The agreement reached in the JLG <,> enables us now to proceed with
the legislative administrative and practical arrangements <,> for
establishing the Court of Final Appeal <,>
<#99:2:A> It has thus secured for us the key objective of having the court up
and running well before nineteen ninety-seven <,> so that it can have maximum
opportunity to gain experience <,> and establish its reputation and authority
<,>
<#100:2:A> Furthermore if the court we established is to give confidence for
the future <,> there must be no room for doubt that it will be able to
continue after nineteen ninety-seven <,>
<#101:2:A> We must not lose sight of that <,,>
<#102:2:A> I should also say that the establishment of the Court of Final
Appeal is a complex matter <,> involving the <.> en </.> enactment of
legislation <,> both in Hong Kong and in the United Kingdom <,>
<#103:2:A> While we aim to establish the court early <,> we are still some
way off being in a position to introduce the necessary bill into this council
<,> and finalise the practical arrangements <,>
<#104:2:A> More work is being done on it <,>
<#105:2:A> And we are acutely aware of the need <,> for there to be
sufficient safeguards on the independence and prestige of the court <,>
<#106:2:A> We will in due course share our ideas with members of this council
and representatives of the legal profession <,>
<#107:2:A> But there is at least one lesson to be learned from experience in
the past few weeks <,>
<#108:2:A> There is clearly a need <,> to find some means of enabling members
to understand better <,> and earlier <,> what goes into propositions <,> to
be put to this council for the enactment of law <,> or the voting of funds
necessary to put into effect agreements reached in the Joint Liaison Group
<,>
<#109:2:A> In exploring such means we must of course respect the provisions
in the Joint Declaration <,> that proceedings of the JLG shall remain
confidential <,> unless otherwise agreed between the two sides <,>
<#110:2:A> I also firmly believe that the first duty to explain such matters
to this council rests with the Hong Kong Government
<#111:2:A> After all <,> they are proposals to which we have given our
agreement <,>
<#112:2:A> It behoves us to justify them <,>
<#113:2:A> Nineteen ninety-one has witnessed the successful elections <,> to
the district boards <,> and municipal councils <,> culminating in the first
direct election to this council on fifteenth September </I>
