<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-028#1:1:A>
I don't have a prepared text <,> because I I prefer to just
have a dialogue <,,> uh I think it  ' s far more interesting that way <,,> so
if you would bear with me my uh my uh talk is a bit disjointed jumping from
issue to issue just bear with me okay cos I prefer to do it that way <,> than
to uh read out a prepared text

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#2:1:A>
Because my my task this afternoon is uh I  ' ve literally just came
back last night a two-week trip to uh Beijing Washington and London <,>
primarily on uh MFN issue uh Beijing and Washington so I can give you the
latest uh <?> bidding </?> edition okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#3:1:A>
That  ' s another reason why I didn't have any time to prepare any
speech <,> but anyway I prefer to do it this way

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#4:1:A>
Uh as most of you uh know that uh MFN issue is a very critical issue
in the last <,> few years because it has become highly politicised especially
in uh in the US

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#5:1:A>
I don't know how much uh background you people uh sort of know about
this particular item

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#6:1:A>
It  ' s actually part of the <,> trade act of nineteen seventy-four
<,> enacted by the US Congress <,> basically directed at <?> armless </?>
countries or non-market economies countries <,> whereby if the country does
not allow free flow of immigration of its <,> people then uh America can use
<,> this <.> MF </.> MFN tool to uh basically <,> force the freedom of
movement of people through this trade sanction tactic

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#7:1:A>
And that is why uh recently uh some of the democratic <,>
politicians in the US is trying to use this it is kind of stretching the
issue a bit <,> trying to use this tool to basically force uh human rights
development and other <,> non-trade activities <,> in China <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#8:1:A>
<unc> 1-word </unc> recently uh <,> we have always been <?>
sort of </?> American Chamber we go on uh one mission different Chambers will
will make different trips and individuals go over there to lobby <,>
Washington

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#9:1:A>
But this year <,> for the first <,> time we are be able to sort of
rally all the local trade organisations seven leading trade associations <,,>
uh from the Hong Kong General Chamber to the Federation of Hong Kong
Industries <,> the Toy Council the Exporters Association <,> Chinese
Manufacturers Association <,> and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#10:1:A>
Because I felt personally uh having worked on this for some years
<,> that it is far more impactful <,> to go as a group <,> rather than all of
us trying to visit Washington and uh politicians on the hill <,> okay get
sick and tired of uh people coming from Hong Kong talking on the same subject

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#11:1:A>
We feel that we go together and concentrate our efforts over three
day period <,> we will get all the appointments that we want to <,> we want
to see <,> but I think that it has been highly successful <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#12:1:A>
Now having said that <,> we were also advised by uh the Deputy
Trade Representative uh <,> US Deputy Trade Representative  <,> number two
to <?> Carla Hills </?> <,> Mr Joe Massey when he was through here <,> that
it would be <,> better for us to also go to Beijing before we arrived in
Washington <,,> so that at least we can say that we are lobbying both sides
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#13:1:A>
It  ' s basically Hong Kong is playing a honest broker role

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#14:1:A>
We are caught in the middle <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#15:1:A>
The issue is not directly related to us but however <,> without that
our trade will be <,> adversely uh affected

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#16:1:A>
Uh seventy percent of China  ' s exports <,> to the United States comes
through here <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#17:1:A>
It will <.> aff </.> affect a lot of jobs <,> in Hong Kong <,> and our
economy will be affected <,> something like six uh five to six percentage point <,> 
of the total GDP <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#18:1:A>
So I think it  ' s a significant situation that we <,> have no choice but
to work on it uh <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#19:1:A>
If we don't work on it and and MFN gets terminated we may <,> be
sorry that we didn't do any lobbying work

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#20:1:A>
So we decide as a group

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#21:1:A>
We went to Beijing first <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#22:1:A>
Uh we uh managed to see uh Ton Zhiguan who is the number two in
<unc> 1-word </unc> which is the Ministry <,> of uh Foreign Trade

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#23:1:A>
Uh he is the one who uh negotiates on all trade issues with the
United States

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#24:1:A>
So we spent an hour with him

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#25:1:A>
Then we had uh another session with uhm Hong Kong Macau Office

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#26:1:A>
Lu Ping was in Shanghai so we met with his deputy uh <,> Chan
Zhiying and uh and also uh Zhi Pangfai <,> who was uh also joined in the meeting

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#27:1:A>
We uh met with them for over an hour and then followed by lunch <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#28:1:A>
Now our task basically is really to tell the Hong Kong story <,,> on uh
how without MFN how Hong Kong will be affected <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#29:1:A>
That  ' s number one

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#30:1:A>
Number two objective is really to help <,,> both Beijing and
Washington <,> to better understand each side  ' s position <,,> because for
example <,> the Chinese leadership as you know <,> are made up of uh people in their
eighties

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#31:1:A>
They  ' ve gone through long <?> hardship </?> 

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#32:1:A>
They  ' re very very nationalistic <,> in their thinking <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#33:1:A>
Simply put <,> <unc> 1-word </unc> their feeling is that MFN <,> is
something that US Government or US Congress can either give <,> or not give

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#34:1:A>
It  ' s the US prerogative <,> to exercise that particular <.>
sit </.> uh action

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#35:1:A>
But to put conditions on <.> FN </.> MFN <,> they feel very strongly
that then the the Americans are using that as a threat <,> on China

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#36:1:A>
Chinese leadership don't like that

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#37:1:A>
We don't want to be threatened <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#38:1:A>
That  ' s the psychology of the situation

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#39:1:A>
Whether it  ' s right or wrong

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#40:1:A>
I  ' m not here to <,> say whose position is right or whose position
is wrong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#41:1:A>
I  ' m going to share with you <,,> the position taken by Beijing  ' s
leadership and the position <,> taken by the US politicians in Washington <,> and
then we  ' ll try to figure out how to help <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#42:1:A>
Okay the fundamental point is this psychological point of that <,>
Chinese leadership just purely does not want to be threatened <,> and in a way
they do have have a point

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#43:1:A>
Either you  ' re going to give the MFN or you don't give the MFN <,> 
because <,> even today after uh going to war with Iraq for example less than a
year ago Iraq still enjoys MFN status <,> from from Washington <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#44:1:A>
Okay that  ' s a powerful argument

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#45:1:A>
Why is it why are you picking on China all of a sudden when Iraq
still enjoys MFN

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#46:1:A>
So this double standard has to be understood <,,> and that  ' s why the
Chinese leadership is very emotional and sensitive about it <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#47:1:A>
The second point

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#48:1:A>
There are really basically three major issues <,> on this debate

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#49:1:A>
Number one is on on uh human rights okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#50:1:A>
Number two <,> is on uh weapons sales <,> okay and I  ' ll explain each one of them

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#51:1:A>
Number three is on the trade deficit <,> the trade imbalance between <,> uh
US and and China

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#52:1:A>
Now let  ' s take the trade imbalance

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#53:1:A>
There  ' s a great debate between the two countries on how these
trade figures are tabulated <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#54:1:A>
Americans purely takes China exports <,> in full value as <,> their
import into the into the US

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#55:1:A>
Now the Chinese are arguing that <,> most of the products made in China
today <,> use a lot of raw materials and ingredients <,> which are originally
originated from the US <,> coming in to China through Hong Kong <,> and then value
added like for example apparel <,> lot of the materials
actually come from from the US and then it  ' s made into shirts and sweaters and
and so forth and re-exported through Hong Kong to the States 

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#56:1:A>
Now <,> you know depending on the item the cost of goods may be forty
percent sixty percent <,> whatever it is

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#57:1:A>
China feels that that should be <,> you know included in the
calculation <,> in order to be fair

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#58:1:A>
So there  ' s a debate on that trade imbalance issue

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#59:1:A>
On human rights <,> obviously we are all for human rights <,,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#60:1:A>
No question about that <,,> but what we are trying to explain to uh to
the Americans <,> is that <,> economic success and prosperity has to come ahead
of political and human rights development

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#61:1:A>
Not the other way round

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#62:1:A>
If you look at Russia <,> Eastern Europe <,,> doesn't work

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#63:1:A>
So therefore <,> since China is already on the uh reform path it is
absolutely critical <,> for for uh US to maintain our MFN status so that we
can continue to trade with China <,> help China and its modernisation <,,> and then
in turn it will help <,> the rest of the population in improving on human rights
and other <,> political <,> uh evolution

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#64:1:A>
Because <,> what China  ' s leadership is most concerned about is control <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#65:1:A>
When you manage one point two billion population <,> the key is
control

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#66:1:A>
Now the other point is when you talk about human rights <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#67:1:A>
To be able to uh achieve <,> okay no starvation whatsoever in China <,>
and have enough clothes for all the population to wear <,> during the winter <,,> to
keep them warm <,> it  ' s basic human rights <,> very basic <,> and that  ' s a major
achievement

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#68:1:A>
Because look at the starvation in Russia and in Ethiopia in India
Bangladesh

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#69:1:A>
And to manage a big population like that is very very difficult <,> and
that  ' s why the leadership <,> is paranoid about control

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#70:1:A>
That  ' s one of the underlying reasons on Tiananmen Square Incident

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#71:1:A>
Now I  ' m not here to defend China

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#72:1:A>
Don't get me wrong

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#73:1:A>
It was very badly handled

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#74:1:A>
It was wrong <,,> but I think we need to look at the bigger picture 
without getting too emotionally involved and say why is it because if if there  ' s
no control in China then there is a chaos <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#75:1:A>
The refugee problem coming out of China will <,> will make the
Vietnamese refugee problem pale by comparison

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#76:1:A>
Okay I  ' m just giving you all the arguments on one side first okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#77:1:A>
Then I  ' ll go to the other side give you all the arguments

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#78:1:A>
You may disagree with any of this right <,> but that  ' s okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#79:1:A>
Everybody has <,> to have freedom of opinion <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#80:1:A>
On weapons sale <,> I think this is very important

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#81:1:A>
I  ' ll tell you why later why it  ' s important <,> or maybe I should
go into it right now

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#82:1:A>
China has been selling uh weapons to the Middle East mainly 

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#83:1:A>
Now as you know most of the major countries <,> sell arms

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#84:1:A>
It  ' s like selling any other products

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#85:1:A>
It  ' s part of their trade

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#86:1:A>
Americas sells a lot of arms to around the world <,> and and the
Chinese position is gee uh the sales we made in arms is
is a fraction of what America is selling around the world

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#87:1:A>
Why are they getting so excited 

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#88:1:A>
Well the fact of the matter is not so much the fact that they are
selling arms okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#89:1:A>
It  ' s the countries that they are selling to that is so sensitive
with Washington

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#90:1:A>
Because China uh is reportedly to be selling to countries like Syria
Libya and Iran <,> which are countries that <,> US feels <,> are terrorist
countries and irresponsible international <.> mem </.> uh <.> mem </.>
irresponsible members of the international community these are the countries
that are trying to de-stabilize the Middle East

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#91:1:A>
So that  ' s why the US is saying that we don't want China to sell
arms to these countries

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#92:1:A>
They don't care if China sells arms to Australia or <,> or to uh
Ireland or to Japan or other countries <,> but it  ' s only these countries that
they are objecting to

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#93:1:A>
It  ' s highly emotional <,> in a presidential election year <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#94:1:A>
And CIA is via satellite is watching the situation very closely

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#95:1:A>
They  ' ve got all kinds of pictures

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#96:1:A>
I mean China makes one move they know

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#97:1:A>
So <,> China  ' s argument is that we are we are selling very little
but Americans  '  point of view is that that  ' s not the point <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#98:1:A>
Now let  ' s go to the American side <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#99:1:A>
American side <,> as I mentioned before it is a presidential election
year <,> where President Bush his popularity is dropping very fast <,> and it looks
like it  ' s going to be a three-man race <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#100:1:A>
And the democrats obviously in a year like this will use every
possible <,> issue <,> or activity to get at the incumbent <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#101:1:A>
And MFN in China happens to be one of those issues because
President Bush is a self-proclaimed China expert

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#102:1:A>
Any any time you say you are a expert in something you are vulnerable
<,,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#103:1:A>
Somebody is going to attack you

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#104:1:A>
But he he I mean he claims that he is a China expert he he
understands those situations

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#105:1:A>
So democrats are really I mean <,> working on him on this and
using this MFN <,> to drive a wedge <,> into this uh whole
political situation

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#106:1:A>
Now <,> the House as you know it  ' s a two-house system <,> in the Congress
you have the house of Representatives with a membership John of about five
hundred or six hundred <,> about five hundred some members <,,> and Senate has one
hundred members

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#107:1:A>
There  ' s two two uh senators from each state <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#108:1:A>
Now the point here is <,> is uh the House in the past <,> voting is so
lopsided in favour of condition putting conditions on it led by uh Nancy
<?> Belosi </?> from San Francisco <,> they put all kinds of
condition on it and of course Beijing reacts forget it <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#109:1:A>
We  ' re not going to accept anything

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#110:1:A>
From my previous comment of of they feel that this is a
threatening thing

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#111:1:A>
They don't like to be threatened <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#112:1:A>
But the democrats are putting conditions <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#113:1:A>
Now that has been defeated <,> or or that has been passed

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#114:1:A>
The bill passed the House easily <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#115:1:A>
It also passed the Senate <,> but you know because of the balance of
power <.> struct </.> uh structure in the United States government structure
it  ' s the House and then the Senate and then the administration which is led by
the President Bush okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#116:1:A>
So any bill that passed must pass all <,,> three <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#117:1:A>
No sources of power

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#118:1:A>
President has a veto power <,,> so he vetoed 

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#119:1:A>
I mean President Bush vetoes all these
conditioned bills

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#120:1:A>
In order to override this veto <,> they need
two-thirds majority <,> in the Senate 

<ICE-HK:S2A-028#121:1:A>
Okay that means <,,> all he needs to do is to get thirty-four Senators
to support his veto <,,> and the veto stays </I>
