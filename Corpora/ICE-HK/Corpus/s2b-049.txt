<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-049#1:1:A>
So actually I did what I expected

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#2:1:A>
This is uhm <?> I </?> hope <?> I </?> hope to say something of uh
<unc> one-word </unc> uh these <.> topic </.> <?> the topics </?>
among friends

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#3:1:A>
<?> It  ' s </?> all good friends and <?> we have </?> no need for
introduction and no need for courtesy

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#4:1:A>
Actually this <unc> multiple words </unc> but but I I uh
<,,> I really want to write a much much much longer essay on this and I think
that what I am going to say is only perhaps <?> only </?> one fifth of what I
uh intended to write uh but it  ' s already uh uh quite a long essays

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#5:1:A>
So I think the <,> uhm <unc> one words </unc> then is uh
will be too sketchy and some slippery

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#6:1:A>
So I think I hope that to <unc> multiple words </unc> later
and <?> I certainly </?> is a kind of draft for this uh for today

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#7:1:A>
Okay <?> let  ' s </?> start to write to to read it

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#8:1:A>
So the topic is the Humanities and Humanistic education

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#9:1:A>
Uhm uhm in <?> a kind of </?> introduction I would like to talk
about Humanities and Humanistic education today not because I have I have any
particular insight into this topic

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#10:1:A>
On the contrary I  ' ve too many questions on the meaning of these
two terms

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#11:1:A>
I want to ask myself whether I understand the very subjects that I
have learnt and taught in the past twenty years

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#12:1:A>
I began my university education first in Architecture and later in
Philosophy which took me almost twelve years to complete

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#13:1:A>
Thereafter I have been teaching Philosophy and Humanity subjects
and later took part in the <.> es </.> in the establishment of <?> BA in </?>
Humanities at the Baptist College

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#14:1:A>
In other words I have directly engaged in the Humanities in
Humanistic Education for many years

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#15:1:A>
Yet I am not sure whether I have a clear idea of what the
Humanities are and why they are being taught

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#16:1:A>
I don't think that is only my problem

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#17:1:A>
Robert E <?> Palter </?> in a recent book on the problems of the
Humanities begins with the followings <O> Quote from <?> Palter  ' s </?> book
</O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#18:1:A>
<?> Palter  ' s </?> <.> pobem </.> problem is ours too

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#19:1:A>
The original Humanities refer to the Western Humanistic traditions
starting from Socrates and Aristotle <?> through </?> Cicero Quintilian and
the Renaissance thinkers down to Matthew Arnold of the late nineteenth
century

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#20:1:A>
This tradition is dead because their ideas and ideals embodied in
the Humanities are no longer relevant in the content we <?> wrote </?>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#21:1:A>
They are <.> distinct </.> they are disintegrated and forgotten

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#22:1:A>
Hence what we cannot define is not the meaning of the Humanities in
the traditional sense but their contemporary usage

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#23:1:A>
What apparently remained is only the name of an administrative
division of the <.> u </.> of the university and a cluster of mostly <,>
connected disciplines under <.> th </.> under the division of the Humanities
or the Arts

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#24:1:A>
Like Philosophy appears in the in the degree of PhD

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#25:1:A>
It is just a name without any meaningful content

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#26:1:A>
I would like to discuss this issue in the context of Hong Kong and
to see whether the Humanities are dead

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#27:1:A>
I would suggest that our situation here is more complicated than
that of <?> Palter  ' s </?> since we are not just facing the Western but also
the Chinese tradition of the Humanities <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#28:1:A>
I would outline the difficulties in <.> fig </.> in define the
Humanities in both traditions and the implication to the Humanistic edition
uh education

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#29:1:A>
Number two <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#30:1:A>
So what are the Humanities

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#31:1:A>
One easy way to answer it is to check the meaning in the dictionary

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#32:1:A>
The Concise Oxford Dictionary reads <quote> learning quote learning
or literature <.> con </.> concern with human nature and culture especially
study of Latin and Greek classics </quote>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#33:1:A>
It is clearly not very useful because it  ' s both too broad and too
narrow

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#34:1:A>
Sociology and Anthropology are concerned with human culture

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#35:1:A>
Yet it is rather difficult to include them under the Humanities

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#36:1:A>
If the Humanities refer only to the study of Latin and Greek
Classics as some universities in the USA still do then obviously most
commonly regarded as Humanity subjects will fall outside this category

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#37:1:A>
The definition given by the National Endowment for the Humanities
offers a no better option

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#38:1:A>
This is a quote <O> A long quote follows designating a number of
specific subjects as belonging to the field of Humanities </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#39:1:A>
This array of disciplines does not take us very far in the search
for an understanding or <?> the </?> meanings of the Humanities

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#40:1:A>
However it gives an indication of the meaning of Humanities through
the implication of their opposite the Sciences

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#41:1:A>
The Humanities are concern with quality and value of human life and
culture employing historical and philosophical approaches while the realm of
the objective and the quantifiable belong to the scientific investigation

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#42:1:A>
The Humanities and the Sciences are two distinctly separated areas
of discipline

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#43:1:A>
One is subjective and speculative the and the other is objective
and realistic

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#44:1:A>
I think <?> C P Snow </?> has pointed out long time ago the danger
of this separation as two opposing cultures <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#45:1:A>
But the original meaning of Humanities if we go back to the
Classical root <,> should not have any anti-scientific connotation

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#46:1:A>
<foreign> D'estutia Humanitatis </foreign> in the Renaissance
includes not only Literature the Arts the Philosophy but also scientific
study of nature

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#47:1:A>
The opposition between Humanities and the Sciences is only a
contemporary phenomenon

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#48:1:A>
Indeed the meaning of <unc> one-word </unc> Humanities <.>
intuit </.> is rooted deeply in the Classical tradition

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#49:1:A>
It grows out of the idea of men and the ideal of education

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#50:1:A>
The term Humanities comes from the Latin <foreign> Humanitas
</foreign>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#51:1:A>
The Roman <unc> one-word </unc> uh <unc> one-word
</unc> in the Second Century gave a definitive <,> formulation of the
term

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#52:1:A>
This I quote <O> Quote of the formula </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#53:1:A>
In this passage the end of quote in this passage the meaning of the
Humanities is determined by two interconnected ideas which eventually have
proved a proof to be of lasting important in understanding of the Humanities

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#54:1:A>
One is the axiological idea of a human being

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#55:1:A>
A person is to be distinguished from all other creatures and in him
alone lies the possibility of actualizing the highest virtue of man <,> that
is the <.> Human </.> <foreign> Humanitas </foreign>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#56:1:A>
On the other hand there is a programmatic idea a curriculum the <?>
boneless </?> artist <?> yielding </?> to this actualization <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#57:1:A>
Hence the Humanities are both the ideal of man and curriculum for
the Humanistic Education

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#58:1:A>
Nevertheless it  ' s not <,> very clear as to what exactly the ideal
of human being and what this curriculum should consist

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#59:1:A>
The aim of education is to bring out the virtue of man to become
fully humanized

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#60:1:A>
To model on the fully humanized man a person in the castle age I I
suggested is Aristotle idea of philosopher and Cicero  ' s orator <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#61:1:A>
However philosopher and orator are not necessarily two contrary
ideas

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#62:1:A>
Both come <.> f </.> from the idea of <?> padeia </?> the Greek
ideals of education

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#63:1:A>
To be a free person as well as to be a good citizen

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#64:1:A>
The difference lies only in the priority of the purpose of right

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#65:1:A>
Whether the pursuit of knowledge itself pertains to the goal of a
free man or the fulfillment of civic responsibility is the ultimate criterion
to qualify a good life <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#66:1:A>
To be free means to be free from ignorance prejudice <?> from </?>
narrowness and <.> aro </.> arrogance

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#67:1:A>
And at the same time to be free to seek an intellectual and
contemplative life

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#68:1:A>
<?> Full </?> Philosophy as the highest possible happiness attained
by a person

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#69:1:A>
For Aristotle the desire for knowledge is the basic and deepest
natural urge for the human being

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#70:1:A>
This correlates to a famous definition of <unc> one-word
</unc> <O> Quotation in another language followed by its translation </O>
<quote> A living being possessing the potentiality of reasoning and
articulation </quote> <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#71:1:A>
The highest goal that man may achieve <?> is </?> actualization of
this <,> potentiality of reason <.> whe i </.> which is realized in the form
of metaphysical knowledge <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#72:1:A>
Hello <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#73:1:A>
So the last the last sentence is uh this correlates to a famous
definition of <unc> one-word </unc> <O> Quotation in another language
followed by its translation </O> <quote> A living being possessing the
potentiality of of reasoning and articulation </quote>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#74:1:A>
The highest goal <,> that man may achieve is actualizing of this
potentiality of reason which is realized in the form of metaphysical
knowledge as formulated in this <unc> three words </unc> ethics that
is happiness

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#75:1:A>
The idea that knowledge itself is intrinsically good and valuable
and the model of a philosopher serve as two important parameters <.> or for
</.> for assessing the meaning of the Humanities up to the modern times <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#76:1:A>
For Cicero and Quintilian on the other hand knowledge has no
intrinsic value except as a contribution to the formation of an orator

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#77:1:A>
The status of the orator in the days of Cicero is exceptionally
high

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#78:1:A>
He is not just a good and eloquent speaker but the leader of
society

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#79:1:A>
The proper use of <?> language </?> in the public sphere is the
most important political instrument for an orator

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#80:1:A>
This I quote <O> Quotation from Cicero </O> said Cicero in the
<foreign> De Oratore </foreign>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#81:1:A>
<?> His </?> is the emphasis <.> an </.> on the practical result of
the Humanities

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#82:1:A>
The artist <unc> one-word </unc> which are the basic
requirement for an orator

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#83:1:A>
The orator as a good citizen political leader possesses not only
theoretical knowledge but also moral virtues

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#84:1:A>
Quintilian adds quote <O> Quotation from Quintilian </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#85:1:A>
This moral character of the Humanities remain as a fundamental
principle for all intellectuals who claim to have a Humanistic education

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#86:1:A>
The purpose of education is to serve society

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#87:1:A>
The conception of <foreign> d'estudia Humanitatis </foreign> in the
Renaissance follows that tradition

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#88:1:A>
Leonardo Bruin a humanistic <.> ora </.> a humanistic scholar in
the fifteenth century conceived the meaning of Humanities in the echo of the
Classical heritage

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#89:1:A>
In a friend  ' s in a letter to a friend asking him to devote more
time in the study of of the Humanities he says <O> Quotation from Leonardo
Bruin </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#90:1:A>
These two are therefore called the Humanities because <,> the
perfect and adorned uhm human being homo <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#91:1:A>
I think this brief survey of the Classical conception of <?> the
lesson </?> Humanities in is enough for our purpose in the understanding of
the meaning of the Humanities that is the idea of being human and the
curriculum leading to the actualization of this ideal <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#92:1:A>
If you look at the Chinese tradition for the meaning of the
Humanities we shall find a striking similarity between it and <.> th i </.>
and the Western ideas

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#93:1:A>
Both stress on the moral connotation or the purpose of human
learning

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#94:1:A>
On comparable concept of the Humanities <indig> Yan Man Yan Man
</indig> appears first in the I Ching

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#95:1:A>
This I quote <O> Quotation from the I Ching partly spoken in
Cantonese </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#96:1:A>
The human activities mentioned here are not simply any <.> hu </.>
human activities but a special set of moral activities

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#97:1:A>
The late professor <?> Tan Jung Yee </?> explains

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#98:1:A>
It  ' s a quote

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#99:1:A>
This what I I translated

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#100:1:A>
I think the translation is not very good <,> actually

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#101:1:A>
<O> Quotation from professor Tan translated by speaker A </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#102:1:A>
I think this is really with the tradition <?> dominant </?>
Confucian doctrinal education which aims is to <unc> one-word </unc>
one  ' s small virtue and to thereby extend these small activities to the world

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#103:1:A>
<O> Quotation in Chinese </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#104:1:A>
So I come to the third part

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#105:1:A>
Perhaps I have lingered too long in the Classical tradition

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#106:1:A>
We have to go back where we started in the beginning

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#107:1:A>
According to <?> Palter </?> the original Humanities is dead <,>
and the contemporary Humanities have no direction and are in a chaotic
situation <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#108:1:A>
The obvious reason for the death of the Humanities with the of the
Humanities tradition is the result of the scientific technological revolution
which started in the seventeenth century and thereafter change the world
radically in all aspects of life notwithstanding the idea and aim of
education

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#109:1:A>
The <?> charm </?> of scientific progress set the criterion of
truth based on the scientific paradigm

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#110:1:A>
Reliable knowledge can only be obtained through empirical
scientific methodologies

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#111:1:A>
Knowledge is no longer considered primarily a virtue as Socrates
the Socratic tradition maintains

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#112:1:A>
Knowledge beginning with the radical epistemological turn by
Francis Bacon is power

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#113:1:A>
Knowledge is directed outside the <unc> one-word </unc>
activity towards the world

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#114:1:A>
The moral character of knowledge <.> we </.> becomes a minor issue
whereas the <.> ex </.> explanatory power of scientific knowledge of the
world is a chief concern

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#115:1:A>
Furthermore the application of scientific knowledge to technology
proved to be extremely successful

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#116:1:A>
Hence the value of <?> any knowledge </?> is measured by its
practicality and usefulness

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#117:1:A>
The Humanities can by no means claim any sense of usefulness

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#118:1:A>
The status as knowledge is problematic

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#119:1:A>
The <?> object </?> of studies of <unc> one-word </unc>
Humanities is not the objective world of facts but the written texts

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#120:1:A>
The study of Philosophy is another <?> set of </?> ideas out of
some Philosophers  '  mind

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#121:1:A>
It is at best only ideas upon ideas

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#122:1:A>
What  ' s the point to know the concept of transcendent in <?>
Rousseau Phenomenology </?> or the idea of tragedy by Shakespeare

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#123:1:A>
To rephrase Marx a little bit <&> There is no indication of when
the paraphrase from Marx ends </&>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#124:1:A>
So far the Humanities have interpreted the world argued about
human nature explained the past

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#125:1:A>
It described human suffering and happiness

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#126:1:A>
But the point is how to change all of them

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#127:1:A>
I don't think the Humanities have the answer for that

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#128:1:A>
What the world needs most so we are told are certainly not orators
or philosophers or virtuous men but scientists and <?> techn </?>
technologies with concrete contribution to knowledge and ability to change
the world according to human needs <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#129:1:A>
At the same time, the demand for knowledge specialization and the
restructuring of the modern university <.> for </.> further disintegrate the
Humanities into separate departments of learning

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#130:1:A>
The organic unity of the artist <unc> one-word </unc> has
lost its bond

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#131:1:A>
The Classical unity of <.> cla </.> of Chinese Humanities that is
Literature History and Philosophy that should be <indig> Man Sze Chit
</indig> has broken down into three different departments which are most of
the time completely ignorant of each other

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#132:1:A>
Our situation in Hong Kong is even worse

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#133:1:A>
Literature is not only separated from History and Philosophy but
also from culture

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#134:1:A>
A graduate in English Literature learnt a lot about Shakespeare
but without a clue on who <?> Lee Po </?> might be

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#135:1:A>
feels no embarrassment at all

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#136:1:A>
No wonder

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#137:1:A>
It  ' s not his fault because his teacher probably does not even
recognize the need to know the Chinese Literature

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#138:1:A>
Perhaps maybe it  ' s not a case if it  ' s a <?> comparativist </?>

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#139:1:A>
The grouping of disciplines and to which faculties follows no
definite principles

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#140:1:A>
History

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#141:1:A>
A traditional Humanity subject can be put under social sciences

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#142:1:A>
The other disciplines are put together because of administrative
inertia

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#143:1:A>
Each every discipline can be an independent at would at as it
would claim

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#144:1:A>
Inter-disciplinary studies or research is a superficial and not a
very serious business

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#145:1:A>
So is academic situation <unc> one words </unc> the death
of traditional Humanities

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#146:1:A>
The problem is apparently there is no problem at all

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#147:1:A>
Apparently we are all at ease with the present situation as long
as we have found our own haven in the academic world

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#148:1:A>
The question <.> wha </.> what the Humanities are and what the
aims of Humanistic education is are barely discussed among colleagues

<ICE-HK:S2B-049#149:1:A>
They were not even mentioned during the <.> re </.> <unc>
one-word </unc> exercise of the degree BA in Humanities </I>
