<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X6:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X7:1:Z>
<{> <[> So </[> since you and I we know each other well

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X8:1:Z>
We would have you know <?> cost </?> a benefit a natural

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#10:1:A>
Okay but what <?> if </?> the after

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#11:1:A>
What did they want to <{> <[> know </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X12:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X13:1:Z>
What did they are

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X14:1:Z>
I I think the idea is to <?> criticize </?> what sort of accent
have the people would study in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X15:1:Z>
And <{1> <[1> according </[1> to Sarah level of studies except
house fair with its English

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X16:1:Z>
Now I <unc> two-words </unc> extraordinary kids

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X17:1:Z>
Let  ' s see the <unc> two-words </unc> your English but no
<?> coz </?> it

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X18:1:Z>
I want to explain to me some <?> since </?> because <&> tut </&>
the other day you were explaining me some <unc> one-word </unc> on
the telephone about your new office in Canton

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X19:1:Z>
And I wanted you to <,> uh explain to me you know the setting up

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X20:1:Z>
What does the reaction of the people nothing personal

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X21:1:Z>
And <,> you use a number of Chinese metaphor expression

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X22:1:Z>
<{2> <[2> I like you to explain some to </[2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-078#23:1:A>
<[1> Okay </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#24:1:A>
<[2> Woo right you  ' re firing </[2> </{2> me five six questions at
the time <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> but <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#25:1:A>
Let me tell you something about my English okay

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#26:1:A>
Uhm I haven't to process a musical year

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#27:1:A>
And as a result uh it probably helps me in differentiating between
accents

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#28:1:A>
It helps me in differentiating between <,> English spoken by
different <,> people like yourself being French

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#29:1:A>
Like uh my schoolmates at school being Hong Kong Chinese

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#30:1:A>
Like my English teachers <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#31:1:A>
I think you know well one was American with an American accent

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#32:1:A>
Uhm <,> another one was a <,> I I never had an English English
teacher

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#33:1:A>
I mean <{2> <[2> from England that is no no </[2> that is <{3> <[3>
from </[3> England <{4> <[4> or anything </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#34:1:A>
But the <,,> I think I was lucky enough for the school I went all
the classes I  ' ve been to

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#35:1:A>
The English teachers <,> are the <.> Ch </.> you know who who
themselves were Chinese <,> spoke <,> did not speak with a Hong Kong accent
<{5> <[5> which means </[5> you

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#36:1:A>
You know I could differentiate but it was it wasn't improper

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#37:1:A>
It wasn't really proper

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#38:1:A>
And <.> noth </.> nothing nothing English about it or American
about it or any <?> they </?>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X39:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#190:1:A>
<[> Very in </[> </{> Hong Kong <,> it  ' s very important

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#191:1:A>
I deal with the I deal with large corporations

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#192:1:A>
I mean I mean finance I mean consumer finance I do high-purchases

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#193:1:A>
<{1> <[1> Uh </[1> unlike <,> five six years back still I mean I I
<,> I was in this line we  ' ll before that but unlike five <?> six </?> five
six years back when you could still <,> you know uh get around without much
English

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#194:1:A>
The <,> uhm without much English in my field rather the <,> uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#195:1:A>
The mode of operation the uhm <,> the the the uh the way to
survive and beat your competition is <,> is <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#196:1:A>
It changes when the market does

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#197:1:A>
And the market changes in in the electrical appliances fields the
retailing field

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#198:1:A>
In a sense in the sense that <,> uhm <,> the small time has <?>
now </?> gone

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#199:1:A>
The large corporation chain stores are in

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#200:1:A>
Department store take over stores like Fortress take over <?>
Thalin </?>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#201:1:A>
And what have you <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#202:1:A>
And <,> if you want to do business you really got to be
professional and <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#203:1:A>
I deal I deal I deal I deal with Fortress <{3> <[3> <,> uhm </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#204:1:A>
And at that time and even still now I mean they they <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#205:1:A>
As you know they are under the umbrella of uh Hutchison and <,> uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#206:1:A>
You have got <?> Watson  ' s </?> immediately above them

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#207:1:A>
And then of course they belong to the Hutchison group

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#208:1:A>
And the of course you know they they <,> pretty professional <{4>
<[4> in </[4> in you know <{5> <[5> <,> just </[5>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X209:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X210:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X211:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X212:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X213:1:Z>
<[5> But </[5> </{5> <unc> three words </unc> they are
proposed recent

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X214:1:Z>
Do you have to uh write and your <{> <[> set </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-078#215:1:A>
<[> No </[> </{> I  ' m I  ' m just coming to this now <{1> <[1>
<,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#216:1:A>
You see in a sense that you know when you deal with uh an
organization a bit you know uh chain store and uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#217:1:A>
You have to <,> you come up with proposal you  ' ve come up with
good English

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#218:1:A>
You know <,> it  ' s not really <,> it  ' s not good English in a
sense of <,> <.> si </.> <{2> <[2> you know </[2> studying English or or or
or or or or uh you know because in business business English is never never
demanding

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#219:1:A>
You just have to be exact

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#220:1:A>
And the presentation will have to be proper

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#221:1:A>
You have to be <,> in a correct business format

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#222:1:A>
Uhm forget about the <,> you know details about about the uhm <,>
the requirements of the business

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#223:1:A>
<{3> <[3> because </[3> we  ' re not into this now

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X224:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X225:1:Z>
<[2> Later </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X226:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X227:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-078#228:1:A>
But in that way English is required

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#229:1:A>
But I don't think it  ' s not demand not demanding at all and I
think I think it  ' s something that anybody can do this <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#230:1:A>
This <,> the fact that I got these deals uh has nothing to do with
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#231:1:A>
Well alright it  ' s got to do with correct English being used

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#232:1:A>
But it  ' s not really advanced English that has to be <{1> <[1>
used </[1> to get these deals

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#233:1:A>
I mean you need a lot more you know your your <,> <&> tut </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#234:1:A>
Every other <?> factors </?> that is necessary <{2> <[2> to make
</[2> the you know <{3> <[3> the </[3> the the deal <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> to to
close the deal

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#235:1:A>
<{5> <[5> Now </[5> <,> on uh <,> let say on a social level or
even <,> if it  ' s <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#236:1:A>
If I had to see the people have meeting with them I had the <.>
gwái lóu </.> <&> These Cantonese words refer to foreigners </&> speak
English

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#237:1:A>
I think they appreciate me

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#238:1:A>
My <?> Englished </?> does help

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#239:1:A>
Uh <,> but also you know I think it  ' s it  ' s a again it  ' s it  ' s
just one <,> part of many <,> that is necessary in the entire makeup

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#240:1:A>
Because see those people don't judge your English but people would
know they can tell if your English is no good <{6> <[6> <,> </[6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#241:1:A>
Uhm <{7> <[7> <,> and and they would </[7>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X242:1:Z>

Alright I I uh coming back to this committee of mine <{> <[> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#265:1:A>
Uh <,> it  ' s a knowledge of the proceedings of meeting

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#266:1:A>
Uh that is necessary uh more so than the

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#267:1:A>
Again more so than the quality of English

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#268:1:A>
Like in in the meeting you have to know how to open it you have
know you know the the gender we have to be introduced

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#269:1:A>
You  ' ve got you have to let the people talk

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#270:1:A>
You have to uhm lead them into <,> uh <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#271:1:A>
Well oh oh okay allow them to to to add a <?> views </?> and be
fair when there  ' s an agreement et cetera et cetera

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#272:1:A>
I mean these things require a certain <,> uh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X273:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X274:1:Z>
<unc> one-word </unc> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-078#275:1:A>
No no no I or I I I can't find the word you know it  ' s uh it  ' s
a set of

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#276:1:A>
It  ' s a set of uhm <,> terms and and and and word and jargon of
meeting that is <{> <[> necessary </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X277:1:Z>
<[> Oh yes </[> </{> yes yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-078#278:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#279:1:A>
Yeah </[1> you want to call a vote and you know those in flavour
say a et cetera et cetera you know things <{2> <[2> like that

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#280:1:A>
So that </[2> one is that and uhm where did I get that from

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#281:1:A>
I never read books about it

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#282:1:A>
I just attended other meetings <,> uh I serve uhm you know in
other meetings and it  ' s conducted by by of course uh there were good
chairman and there were not so good chairman <{3> <[3> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#283:1:A>
And I just I </[3> just pick <,> what I think <{4> <[4> pick other
</[4> better <?> ones </?>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#284:1:A>
And I I catch on <{5> <[5> you see </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#285:1:A>
And that  ' s all

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#286:1:A>
But I was just saying about you know on a uh on the business level
when you  ' re during a meeting <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#287:1:A>
Uhm I think in Hong Kong it is uh <,> it is an advantage if you
have a good command

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#288:1:A>
Being Chinese if you have good command of English <&> tut </&> and
if you <,> uh if you can use that to advantage plus the other things that you
have you know in the to to make to make uh any meetings successful or any
negotiation successful

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#289:1:A>
You better off than the man the the other man that  ' s for sure

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#290:1:A>
<{6> <[6> You know when </[6> where you when you <,> when you
speak with non-Chinese

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X291:1:Z>
<[1> To conduct the meeting and the <unc> one-words
</unc> </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X292:1:Z>
<[2> Yes yes familiarity </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X293:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm and you pick the well </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X294:1:Z>
<[4> You do it </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X295:1:Z>
<[5> Yeah yeah </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X296:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm uhm uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X297:1:Z>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X298:1:Z>
Do do you <,> the fact that you know <,> the two languages you
know very very <{1> <[1> well </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X299:1:Z>
Does <{2> <[2> <unc> one-word </unc> </[2> she do you do
<{3> <[3> I mean </[3> <?> everybody </?> <{4> <[4> you do </[4> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-078#300:1:A>
<[1> No </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#301:1:A>
<[2> No </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#302:1:A>
<[3> No no no </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#303:1:A>
<[4> No no </[4> </{4> I I  ' m not modest in anything

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#304:1:A>
I  ' m not modest

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#305:1:A>
I  ' m just I  ' m just being factual <{> <[> is that <?> ice </?>
</[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X306:1:Z>
<[> But does </[> </{> he does he uh sort of multiply to see <,>
foreign in in the meeting can come out very very differently from <,> from
foreigners who are <,> recently meeting and the Chinese views in the meeting

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X307:1:Z>
I mean the fact that just speak good English does it

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X308:1:Z>
How do you to express in more Chinese view </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-078#309:1:A>
My views <,> are mine

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#310:1:A>
I don't know whether they are Chinese or English or western or
eastern or whatever

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#311:1:A>
My views are my views <{1> <[1> but </[1> <,> I had difficulties
in expressing my views when I conduct meetings in Chinese

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#312:1:A>
I I I can't find the terms I  ' m not used to used to them <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#313:1:A>
Uh now that I  ' ve started my <{2> <[2> office in </[2> Guangzhou

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#314:1:A>
No it  ' s true

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#315:1:A>
Now that <{3> <[3> I  ' ve </[3> started my office in Guangzhou and
<,> through practice I have improved

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#316:1:A>
But <,> it  ' s still nothing like uh <{4> <[4> like my English

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#317:1:A>
And </[4> day to day I <?> married </?> I have a daughter <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#318:1:A>
Uhm it at home <,> we speak <,> well uh uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#319:1:A>
My wife and I speak <,> Cantonese <{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#320:1:A>
And because my daughter <,> you know when she was born I don't
like Hong Kong education period

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#321:1:A>
I think the schools are noisy I think the schools are bad the
teachers are bad

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#322:1:A>
And I don't think the universities very good either if you ask me
<&>

<$Z> laughs </&> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#323:1:Z>
Now uhm you can laugh but <{6> <[6> <,> but </[6> uhm <,> I want
my daughter I don't <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#324:1:Z>
I cannot I cannot see the meaning behind having pushing young
children <,> to go through hours and hours of <,> meaningless homework every
every night when they get back home

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#325:1:Z>
Because the teacher has to you know require them to memorize the
words you know English and Chinese menu

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#326:1:Z>
And then they have to they they have to dictate it verbatim <{7>
<[7> <,> </[7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#327:1:Z>
Maybe this  ' s it  ' s wrongly use <{8> <[8> here <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#328:1:Z>
Well </[8> it  ' s wrongly use because it  ' s dictation you <{9> <[9>
know </[9> uh in in including including sort of these punctuation marks

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#329:1:Z>
Uh and and and if you just <,> you know <?> error </?> little bit

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#330:1:Z>
Uhm then you don't get the marks and it <?> is </?> and it is
amount of homework it  ' s it  ' s it  ' s quite meaningless I think

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#331:1:Z>
That  ' s why I always wanted my daughter to go into international
school

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#332:1:Z>
And being all Chinese my family <,> I I I started speaking English
to my daughter ever since

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-078#X333:1:Z>
