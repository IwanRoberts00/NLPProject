Well a very good evening

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#2:1:A>
Welcome to the Macau Jockey Club  ' s Taipo racecourse once again we
have ah sand racing this evening the going is normal watering <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#3:1:A>
ten race programme and the runners behind the barriers for race
number two <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#4:1:A>
the Kembla Grange Handicap class six gallopers over a thousand and
fifty metres and favourite throughout has been the horse on screen at the
moment that is Super Treasure from the Michael Kent stable having the second
start for him to be ridden by Andy Tsang <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#5:1:A>
we will of course bring you a replay of race one in around twenty
five minutes ah first of all though we  ' ll give you our selections for this
ah second event <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#6:1:A>
Franko Lau likes the chances of two Tau Fair Two he  ' s a ten to one
quote to defeat one Super Treasure and nine Golden Apple two one and nine for
Franko Lau <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#7:1:A>
and Harry Troy going the way of Super Treasure two Yau Fair Two
three Happy Horse and nine Golden Apple <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#8:1:A>
and myself I  ' ve liked the run of Gold Champion of late number eight
and I  ' m willing to put him on top <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#9:1:A>
ahead of number one Super Treasure and three Happy Horse ah <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#10:1:A>
Super Treasure for me he  ' s the banker material in the race you can
banker him to being in your Qs and your tierces <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#11:1:A>
but ah he is always a risk of winning these types of races you look
at his record only two wins ten times he  ' s been placed in second and <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#12:1:A>
how many times have those ah placings ah of those ten placings that
he  ' s loomed up to win ah but when under pressure just doesn't seem to want
to go on with it ah did a pretty good effort first up but again second place
for Super Treasure so <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#13:1:A>
for me he  ' s one really to play around in the Qs and multi banker
maybe in the tierces and <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#14:1:A>
you can probably stand him out as far as the tierces are concerned
but to take the one point seven for him to win the race is a bit of a risk
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#15:1:A>
I  ' ve gone eight Gold Champion one Super Treasure and as far as
three Happy Horse is concerned ah I  ' ve thrown him in for third it  ' s going
to be ah concern if he jumps out of the gates cleaning because he hasn't been
jumping out of the gates well <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#16:1:A>
But he  ' s still been running pretty well under the circumstances I
thought if he did happen to get out of the gates ah reasonably well tonight
he would have to be a legitimate chance <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#17:1:A>
and also got to stress that number nine Golden Apple who is the ah
second favourite at six to one is another that ah has not been jumping
cleanly from the gates in recent times so I  ' m just willing to leave him out
on that score <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#18:1:A>
the fact that he  ' s six to one and <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#19:1:A>
the other one that I mentioned not jumping well Happy Horse he  ' s
twenty to one so I  ' d rather be throwing him in <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#20:1:A>
eight one and three <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#21:1:A>
quickly go through the changes for tonight  ' s programme <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#22:1:A>
ah the first change comes in the third event number three I Can Fly
is out he  ' s replaced by the first standby The Way I Know barrier nine K S
Tam to take that ride <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#23:1:A>
race four is clear of changes in the fifth event number five
Shanghai Industry has been withdrawn he  ' s replaced by the second standby <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#24:1:A>
number five will be Easy And Happy barrier six Horace Lam to ride

and there  ' s no replacement runner <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#25:1:A>
our next change comes in race six number nine Flying Stride is out
he  ' s replaced by the first standby the griffin graduate number nine will be
Diamond Stars barrier eleven Bradley Stewart takes that ride <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#26:1:A>

stage <,>

Franko Lau but first of all <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-018#31:1:B>
Thanks Steve and a very good evening everyone <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#32:1:B>
as the runners start to load for the second of the night it  ' s the
Kembla Grange Handicap flashing at one point six Super Treasure <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#33:1:B>
and he has been at a similar quote throughout <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#34:1:B>
nicely drawn barrier two Andy Tsang taking <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#35:1:B>
three pounds off his back <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#36:1:B>
all clear is up and they  ' re off and running and he came out
running did the favourite <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#37:1:B>
getting away very well tonight was Happy Horse he  ' s going to take
up the early ah lead and joined by Yau Fair Two now Tai Fat Hero prominent
also making a line of three but scooting up on the inside now to take the
lead is is ah Golden Apple <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#38:1:B>
joined by Happy Horse making a line of three then is uh Tai Fat
Hero <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#39:1:B>
favourite getting the drop on them in fourth and that  ' s Super
Treasure a little bit deep No Money No Honey but more prominent tonight Yau
Fair Two has dropped back now to a midfield position <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#40:1:B>
now sneaking up on the inside of Yau Fair Two is Leun Yat Victory
Tenor Forever prominent followed then by All Steady he  ' s losing ground <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#41:1:B>
Gold Champion a long way back tonight followed then by Great Gain
and Jolly Good Fellow whips them in <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#42:1:B>
on towards the corner Happy Horse has run via the cape and dashing
to the front Tai Fat Hero <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#43:1:B>
giving chase Super Treasure <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#44:1:B>
running on fairly down the outside No Money No Honey Yau Fair Two
in the centre <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#45:1:B>
but nicely clear is Tai Fat Hero inside the final one fifty giving
chase Super Treasure No Money No Honey runs on <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#46:1:B>
but racing away is Tai Fat Hero who  ' s a bit too strong for Super
Treasure <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#47:1:B>
closing late Great Gain for third then came No Money No Honey Jolly
Good Fellow running on when the race was all over followed by Leun Yat
Victory <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#48:1:B>
next over the line was Gold Champion Yau Fair Two followed then by
All Steady <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#49:1:B>
Golden Apple  ' s pulled up very quickly and Happy Horse after
running off the track <,> has run stone motherless last <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#50:1:B>
now Tenor Forever in fact it was <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#51:1:B>
I think that come through late for third <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#52:1:B>
it was in fact Tenor Forever in the purple cap Great Gain in the
checkered cap was the one that finished back towards the tail but <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#53:1:B>
Tai Fat Hero in the hands of Bash Siu <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#54:1:B>
he  ' s got away a little bit better last start <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#55:1:B>
and after being away much better today <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#56:1:B>
he took up the running from Super Treasure <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#57:1:B>
he enjoyed a nice run behind them Super Treasure and he has run on
okay <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#58:1:B>
but never going to pick up Tai Fat Hero and the old timer Tenor
Forever <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#59:1:B>
runs on nicely for third and not too far away No Money No Honey so
it  ' s eleven <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#60:1:B>
one and seven <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#61:1:B>
eleven one and seven after the running of race number two <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#62:1:B>
and the winner number eleven <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#63:1:B>
Tai Fat Hero Eric Suen prepares Bash Siu rode <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#64:1:B>
seven year old bay brown Australian bred gelding by King  ' s High
from Steel Sculptress <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#65:1:B>
he  ' s been a long time out of the winners circle this fellow <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#66:1:B>
did have a very good sand record previous <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#67:1:B>
and a couple of wins to his credit at the distance but he  ' s been a
long while out of form descended from class four to class six and he  ' s
finally broken through tonight number one is second <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#68:1:B>
Super Treasure <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#69:1:B>
Andy Tsang rode Super Treasure for Mick Kent number seven winding
up in third Tenor Forever <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#70:1:B>
and the apprentice C Chao rode for Kee ha Lei <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#71:1:B>
officially fourth was number six No Money No Honey bit better run
by him he was away much better tonight and Eureka Rosa de Silva rode for Joe
Murphy so <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#72:1:B>
it  ' s eleven one seven and six <,> after the running of race number
two <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-018#73:1:A>
Bash Siu earning his riding fee tonight because actually ah
the ah while they were in the parade ring he actually ah Tai Fat Hero
dislodged Bash Bash Siu who  ' s walking a little gingerly but he  ' s taken a
ride and uh he  ' s been victorious <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#74:1:A>
number eleven Tai Fat Hero three hundred and forty four fifty the
win thirty six dollars the place it  ' s another second for Super Treasure that  ' s
the eleventh on the sand in his career <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#75:1:A>
he returns twelve fifty number seven Tenor Forever running in third
at forty one fifty <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#76:1:A>
one and eleven quinella one hundred and eighty four fifty the
tierce ten thousand five hundred and eighty two <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#77:1:A>
the winning margin one and a half lengths there was two and three
quarters between second and third they  ' ve ran one o five point seven <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#78:1:A>
not a bad run time ah only one second outside of the class record
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#79:1:A>
in recent meetings they  ' ve usually been around two seconds outside
of the class record so the track hasn't been riding that fast so we  ' ll get a
an idea later on but it just seems a reasonable ah <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#80:1:A>
time having a look at it eleven one and seven are the numbers for
race two <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#81:1:A>
<&> Commercial break </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-018#82:1:A>
Welcome back live to Taipo racecourse we now have the weighed
in sign for race two and the numbers are eleven one and seven <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#83:1:A>
Tai Fat Hero winning for Eric Suen and Bash Siu three hundred and
forty four fifty and thirty six dollars <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#84:1:A>
number one Super Treasure twelve fifty seven Tenor Forever running
in third at forty one fifty <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#85:1:A>
a hundred and eighty four fifty for the Q <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#86:1:A>
ten thousand five hundred and eighty two for the tierce one and a
half by two and three quarters <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#87:1:A>
one o five point seven <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#88:1:A>
Well I have to say it was a strangely run race the two horses that
usually uh miss the start Golden Apple and Happy Horse were there prominent
and Happy Horse ah running out of the track ah this left Tai Fat Hero getting
a nice run through Super Treasure <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#89:1:A>
he  ' s doing the chasing but again it  ' s just another second placing
for him <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#90:1:A>
ah behind ah the first two horses really not much to look at
eventually Tenor Forever running on to grab that third position <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-018#91:1:B>
Yeah Tenor Forever the old timer it  ' s a long time since he  ' s
been out of in the top three spot <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#92:1:B>
but he did run okay best of the rest <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#93:1:B>
these two got right away Tai Fat Hero a very well graded horse here
in class six and he  ' s slowly ran himself into something like race fitness
and he  ' s just been a bit too good for them and away much better tonight <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#94:1:B>
he was part of the lead with Yau Fair Two <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#95:1:B>
Happy Horse begun very well and showing good speed but wanted to
hang coming to the turn and he  ' s run right off the track <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#96:1:B>
but booting right up on the inside Golden Apple away a little
better today taking up the running from Happy Horse in the centre <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#97:1:B>
a bit deep Tai Fat Hero <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#98:1:B>
and on the back of them Super Treasure an and he has enjoyed the
run of the race <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#99:1:B>
in the white colours in the lime cap that  ' s No Money No Honey not
too far away Tenor Forever and Yau Fair Two <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#100:1:B>
and drifting back at that point was <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#101:1:B>
ah let me see All Steady lost ground very very quickly at this
point <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#102:1:B>
Gold Champion was back and never ever travelling Steve and <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#103:1:B>
he  ' s been disappointing tonight and Leun Yat Victory the horse in
the black cap didn't show much speed tonight <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#104:1:B>
you can se Happy Horse running right off the track obviously <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-018#105:1:B>
he  ' s going to pull up with some problem <,> </I>
