Mr Chan Lord <?> Bennatta </?> Mr Cheung ladies and gentlemen

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#2:1:A>
It is a great honour to be invited to address you this morning

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#3:1:A>
We are delighted to be hosting this conference for the second year
of running

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#4:1:A>
<unc> two-words </unc> I suggest Hong Kong  ' s growing
significance in world trade and international transport

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#5:1:A>
I should like to extend a special welcome to our overseas visitors

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#6:1:A>
Particularly those who are visiting Hong Kong for the first time

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#7:1:A>
You  ' ll I  ' m sure be impressed by the share <?> by </?> <unc>
one-word </unc> of this place

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#8:1:A>
Indeed some would say that the pace of life here is unrelenting but
I assure we do pause for breath now and again

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#9:1:A>
Trade is Hong Kong  ' s lifeline and it is greatly facilitated by our
well- developed transport planes with the rest of the world

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#10:1:A>
Together we  ' ve enabled Hong Kong to develop into a manufacture of
sophisticated goods and a leading financial and servicing centre

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#11:1:A>
Hong Kong started like as an entrepot for China trade

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#12:1:A>
In the nineteen sixties and the nineteen seventies we were known
for our exports of textiles garments toys and electronics

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#13:1:A>
Our major markets were the United States and Europe

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#14:1:A>
Over the past decade however the main investors for our growth has
come form trade with our Asian neighbours particularly with Southern China

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#15:1:A>
Our hinterland in Guangdong province to the north of Hong Kong with
a sixty three million people is one of the world  ' s fastest growing areas of
production and consumption

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#16:1:A>
Its output has been doubling every six years and then now accounts
for around twenty percent of China  ' s exports

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#17:1:A>
Our trade with China has increased six times in real terms over the
past decade

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#18:1:A>
In the last two years alone it has grown by nearly forty percent

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#19:1:A>
About two-thirds of China  ' s foreign investment comes from Hong
Kong or through Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#20:1:A>
Some three million workers in Guangdong work for Hong Kong first

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#21:1:A>
You will not see here the heavy-handed government

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#22:1:A>
We believe in market forces and in competition

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#23:1:A>
Businessmen are free to make their own decisions and to take the
risks and profits that go with them

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#24:1:A>
The government  ' s role is to provide a stable environment within
which business can thrive

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#25:1:A>
This means maintaining law and order an efficient civil service a
stable currency low taxes a fair and open judicial system a well-educated
workforce and the necessary physical infrastructure to move people and goods
efficiently and at the least cost

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#26:1:A>
Half the world  ' s population live within five hours flying time of
Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#27:1:A>
Hong Kong International Airport is now the fourth largest in terms
of international freight attended

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#28:1:A>
In nineteen ninety one our airport handled a total of eight hundred
and fifty two thousand tons of cargo with the United States being the major
destination

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#29:1:A>
In nineteen eighty four eighty five the figure was less than half

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#30:1:A>
We have the largest single air cargo handling facility in the world

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#31:1:A>
A second terminal was opened in November last year to cope with
demand

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#32:1:A>
This gross total capacity to one point four million times a year

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#33:1:A>
Base on current projections average will increase to two point
three million times by the year two o one o

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#34:1:A>
Since the existing airport has limited potential for extension we
are pressing full speed ahead for the construction of the new airport

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#35:1:A>
Yesterday we publish the master plan for the airport and announce
the successful weather for the design of the passenger terminal building

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#36:1:A>
We expect to award <?> attender </?> for the formation of the
airport platform in May this year

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#37:1:A>
Plans for the new airport envisage a ten-fold increase in the
already impressive quantities of air-freight that Hong Kong handles

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#38:1:A>
Turning to sea transport above ninety percent of our trade goes
through the port

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#39:1:A>
In nineteen ninety one Hong Kong handled over six million
containers which was a twenty one percent increase over nineteen ninety

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#40:1:A>
Together with Singapore we are the two busiest container ports in
the world

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#41:1:A>
During the year over twenty two thousand ocean-going ships from
more than two hundred lines and over fifty seven thousand river trade vessels
called at Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#42:1:A>
There was one arrival or departure every three minutes

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#43:1:A>
Indeed our current growth at such so we need to add to our port new
facilities the size of Oakland or Seattle every year

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#44:1:A>
Our long-range cargo forecast indicate an annual increase in port
cargo throughput of the order of six point five percent

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#45:1:A>
This is conservative but even so it means we will have to double
our port throughput before this decade is out and double again by the year
two o one one

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#46:1:A>
Port development plans are well-advanced to provide the facilities
needed to meet this forecast demand

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#47:1:A>
Our strategy is to face an new port facilitates as demand builds

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#48:1:A>
Theses developments for the undertaken principally by the private
sector but under an overall strategic plan monitored and updated on the
advice of our Port Development Board

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#49:1:A>
We have under construction container terminal <?> line </?> eight
which will be needed by the middle of next year

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#50:1:A>
Its one point eight million <?> TEU </?> annual capacity will be
totally taken up by mid nineteen ninety five when terminal nine on Tsing Yi
must come into operation

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#51:1:A>
By nineteen ninety-seven we expect total terminal handling capacity
to reach eight point eight million <?> TE use </?>

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#52:1:A>
Our strategic plan then provides for implemental development of a
massive new port on Lantau Island in the western part of our harbour from
nineteen ninety-seven onwards

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#53:1:A>
Apart from physical developments of the port we are strengthening
our status as a world maritime centre

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#54:1:A>
There are now over five hundred shipping companies in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#55:1:A>
Many of which are local officers of international shipping
conglomerates

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#56:1:A>
Hong Kong has a long history as a major ship holding ship
management and ship financing centre

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#57:1:A>
We are taking a series of measures to ensure that the system for
all theses is up-to-date and self-contained

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#58:1:A>
In December nineteen ninety we established our own shipping
register

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#59:1:A>
It has since been performing very well

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#60:1:A>
We expect it to perform even better when we are in the position to
enact the necessary legislation to remove profit tax liability for Hong Kong
registered ships

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#61:1:A>
This will be later in the year the necessary <unc> one-word
</unc> published a days ago

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#62:1:A>
At the same time we are localising the vast amount of UK merged
ship legislation with suitable modifications

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#63:1:A>
This is to ensure that come nineteen ninety-seven there will not
any disruption to the regulatory framework for shipping and the native
industries

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#64:1:A>
This framework must stood the test of time

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#65:1:A>
We are also stepping up our participation in the activities of
international bodies on maritime and port matters to defend our shipping
interest and ensure that seaborne trade between Hong Kong and the rest of the
world will be conducted with the least possible red tape

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#66:1:A>
Ladies and gentlemen our ambitious plans for infrastructural
development has been carefully thought through and will enable Hong Kong to
meet the challenges the years ahead

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#67:1:A>
At the same time the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the future
of Hong Kong and the Basic Law that will provide for the constitution of the
future Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong should ensure continuity in
our system of government and then our social economic and financial policies
after nineteen ninety-seven

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#68:1:A>
We believe that there are good reasons to be confident of our
future notwithstanding the hiccups that are bound to arise in the run-up to
the nineteen ninety-seven and the change of sovereignty

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#69:1:A>
Hong Kong practices an economic philosophy that the whole world is
now embracing

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#70:1:A>
We have an excellent record of trading with all and discriminating
against none

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#71:1:A>
We are at the heart of the fastest growing Asian-Pacific region

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#72:1:A>
We have a first class transport and communication infrastructure

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#73:1:A>
Above all we have a well-educated and resilient workforce who <?>
row for the punches </?> and somehow always manage to come up on top

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#74:1:A>
Hong Kong is and will remain one of the best places in which to do
business

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#75:1:A>
And I have much pleasure in declaring open the nineteen ninety two
International Shipping Conference

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#76:1:A>
Thank you ladies and gentlemen </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-050#77:2:A>
Ladies and gentlemen we  ' ve now come to the end of one must be
described as a very successful International Shippers Conference

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#78:2:A>
It is now time to summarise the activity of this conference

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#79:2:A>
As in doing so I must condense an extremely wide selection of
interesting topics ranging from broad international trade of transport issues
to specific area of interest such as Hong Kong new airport and fiscal
distribution management

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#80:2:A>
In the last eight in the last eight hours speakers from all over
the world and the discussion they have provoke at this conference have
clearly demonstrate that many of today  ' s trade and transport issue and
development however <.> geographic </.> geographically <.> diver </.>
diversed have impact of global proportion

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#81:2:A>
And what we have learn <,> well we have learn for example gain a
new and valuable <.> perspec </.> perspective on current European attitude
toward trade and on future prospect of trade to the new European single
market Central and Eastern Europe

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#82:2:A>
We  ' ve heard that this morning Britain is eyeful for Hong Kong  ' s
future

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#83:2:A>
And it is hoped that Hong Kong vitality and growth may be just a
catalyst for the reform in China

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#84:2:A>
Hong Kong must continues to demonstrate and reaffirm her ability as
one speaker said <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#85:2:A>
We  ' ve also been given an insightful view of Asia-Pacific trade its
strength and weakness and its critical relationship to the US economy

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#86:2:A>
And we have also learned the important factors that will determine
the future of infra-regional trade within this region

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#87:2:A>
On a specific level that <unc> a few words </unc> with a
number of delegate

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#88:2:A>
We have had a chance to study to study Hong Kong  ' s own unique
relationship to the world of international shipping

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#89:2:A>
We have seen now this category is determined to serve global trade
and transport by supplying new local infrastructure project

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#90:2:A>
And where Hong Kong  ' s future lies as an international port a
regional shipping and finance centre and an integral part of the future
commercial development of South-east Asia and the world

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#91:2:A>
Speakers at this conference have told us that the nineteen nineties
will see increasing demand for quality service for just in time service and
that the nature of shipping will change due to technology

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#92:2:A>
And it  ' s likely to play a major role in the future of export
growth in the Asia-Pacific region

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#93:2:A>
In the last several hours we have learned of South China  ' s port
development

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#94:2:A>
And specifically its attraction to sourcing in the region

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#95:2:A>
We have been told about the seafaring cost from the point of view
of the shippers especially from Asian

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#96:2:A>
About the problem faced by carriers in <.> fo </.> forecasting
trade sourcing and changing global relationship in order to meet market
demand

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#97:2:A>
And about the experience and achievement of a multi-national
conglomerate shipping goods from Hong Kong versus the obstacles of moving
goods out of China <,> by land

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#98:2:A>
And we have also learned about Taiwan  ' s growing economy and its
outlook for continuous future trade growth

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#99:2:A>
Even just going over the content of this conference it  ' s a brief
summary <,> form like that it  ' s easy to see that what has been accomplish
has amount to the delivering of a <.> concei </.> <.> con </.> of a
conceivable <?> realm </?> of information

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#100:2:A>
All of which can be directly applied to the improvement of trade
and transport operations here and in other part of the world

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#101:2:A>
Ladies and gentlemen in closing the nineteen ninety two
International Shippers Conference <.> and suggest </.> and suggesting that it
has certainly been an effective as <?> and </?> co-operative as I hope

<ICE-HK:S2B-050#102:2:A>
