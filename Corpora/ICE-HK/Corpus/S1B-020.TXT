<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-020#1:1:A>
Uhm <,> before looking into the poem that we are reading this
year <,> I think it may be helpful if we can <,> narrow down <,> several
areas which may help us to understand a poem certain <,> area which may help
us to appreciate the poem

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#2:1:A>
So in other words what I shall be talking now is more of uh <,>
techniques <,,> the so called techniques use by the poet <,,> or another name
<,> for this one techniques nowadays <?> uh </?> which is <,> more popular is
the word stylistic <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#3:1:A>
In other word where uhm <,> or I  ' d like to spend some time in <,>
identifying <,> some areas which we may detect the area which we may notice
the techniques that come out so that we can be more aware so that we can be
more sensitive when when we read

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#4:1:A>
Or in other words when we read at least we know where to read where
to find <,> things that we may be helpful to understand it okay <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#5:1:A>
Uhm <,,> I think we  ' re <?> bet </?> I think that that <,> there can
be three areas <,,> three area which we can <,> look into or three areas
which we may be more sensitive when we are reading <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#6:1:A>
And the first area is <,,> what we call lexis <,> which actually
means vocabulary <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#7:1:A>
In other word when one direction <,> one area which we may pay
attention to is <,> the words chosen or in other words were the choice of
words <,> the choice of words of the writer

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#8:1:A>
And this can be <,> broken down into several areas <,,> say for
example <,,> uhm in the adjectives <,,> we may like to think what kind of
adjectives <,> what kind of adjectives <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#9:1:A>
Is it <,> about colour <,> what kind of colour <?> skin </?> that we
may have if there are <,> adjective related to colour alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#10:1:A>
Say for example were in uhm <,> in Nineteen Eighty Four as you may
remember that we may pay attention to the description of the colour and that
may bring us some idea of the surrounding or that may bring us some idea of
how George Orwell see London under the rule of <unc> one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#11:1:A>
In other word when through <,> the colour words or through the
adjectives which convey certain colour alright this may help us to get a
certain idea <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#12:1:A>
Or the other senses words that are related to other senses <,,>
like smell or touching or hearing different thing right

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#13:1:A>
Or are there adjectives related to certain kind of values

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#14:1:A>
Say for example right with adjectives convey value like say for
example a kind angry <,> wicked so on and so forth <,> whether he is a good
person or bad person what kind of person what kind of value that this person
had

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#15:1:A>
In other word uh when we look at adjective <,> we try to look at
<,> what kind of adjective here

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#16:1:A>
Does it convey colour does it convey smell or does it convey the
other senses or does it convey any value or any judgment <,> any opinion any
judgment from the poet by the use of the adjectives <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#17:1:A>
Then the other is <,> verb <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#18:1:A>
Now uhm <,> I would not like to make this too complicated right but
uh for your level or for your benefit <,> I think I <,,> we may pay attention
to the nature of verbs whether it is dynamic <,> or whether it is static <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#19:1:A>
When we say of it when we say a a verb is dynamic it means that the
verb is suggesting a kind of very violent or energetic action <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#20:1:A>
Say for example uhm <,,> compare these right I kill him or I stab
him <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#21:1:A>
Or <,,> okay that  ' s <unc> two-words </unc> comparatively
which is more violent Bonnie

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#X22:1:Z>
Verb </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-020#23:1:A>
Stab <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#24:1:A>
Yes right

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#25:1:A>
Or between I kill him and I stab him the interaction stab <,> is
far more violent and this is what we call a dynamic verb because the verb
itself suggest a lot of action a lot of energy involved in the way pronounce
the verb stab

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#26:1:A>
Stab kill much softer kill is nothing kill <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#27:1:A>
Or <,> uhm <&> A long pause </&> <?> when I say </?> he is knocked
down by car <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#28:1:A>
He  ' s knocked down by a car or he had a car accident <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#29:1:A>
Compare these two again he has car accident static <,> is nothing
but because when the word had is a very static word

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#30:1:A>
The word static means uh without any movement without any action
right because something which is static that may something which is not
moving something which is still that is static right

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#31:1:A>
He had a car accident <,> right is nothing

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#32:1:A>
We don't know what actually happen we don't feel <,> the horror we
don't feel the pain

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#33:1:A>
But if I say he he is knocked down by a car then <,> right knocked
down by the car right <,> the verb itself right <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#34:1:A>
Or he is smashed say for example right he is smashed the the verb
itself suggest a lot of action <,> okay <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#35:1:A>
So uh one one thing were that we may pay attention to uh is to look
at the verb whether they are dynamic verbs or static verb right <&> A long
pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#36:1:A>
And <,,> I don't know I don't know whether you <,> are aware of
these

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#37:1:A>
The other implication the other thing that you may look at is
whether the verb is transitive <,> or intransitive <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#38:1:A>
Do you know what transitive verbs are <,> or if you don't know
right forget it

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#39:1:A>
Or I I don't want to confuse you

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#40:1:A>
Now uhm <,> transitive verbs are verbs which must be follow by an
object otherwise it is grammatically wrong that is a transitive verb that is
a verb which is <,> follow by an object or say for example the verb enjoy <,>
you cannot say I enjoy very much full stop

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#41:1:A>
Well that definitely that is wrong right

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#42:1:A>
What do you enjoy that is the point

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#43:1:A>
Because <,> the verb enjoy is a transitive verb that is it must be
follow by an object I enjoy myself at least

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#44:1:A>
Or EYT is called Enjoy Yourself Tonight not enjoy not it is not
called enjoy tonight right Enjoy Yourself Tonight <,> right

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#45:1:A>
And there are some verbs which are intransitive which cannot be
follow by any object <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#46:1:A>
Then of course wherein in English language right most of the verbs
are both transitive and intransitive

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#47:1:A>
But <,> we may be <,> a bit sensitive or we may like to be a to be
more aware if we notice that <,> a writer write in a certain way that there
is no object all the time

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#48:1:A>
There must be some some reason right

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#49:1:A>
There must be some reason when he chooses to write sentences
without any object

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#50:1:A>
It cannot be accidental alright if every sentence or most sentences
are like that right

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#51:1:A>
And then in that case where we try to think why he uses such a
pattern in relation to what he is writing okay <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#52:1:A>
And of course right <,> we <?> been </?> look at the images

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#53:1:A>
This you are very familiar right

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#54:1:A>
In other words <?> where that </?> the words which can be group
together <,> the word which can be group together or the words which could
have uh thematic link <,> that they belong to a certain group right

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#55:1:A>
Say for example uhm <,,> if I say star moon sun cloud sky or fog
even though <?> like </?> they are different item and yet right they can be
group together right

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#56:1:A>
Because when they all fall within the same group or in other word
where there are uhm thematic link right

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#57:1:A>
And uh all these words <,,> all these <,> star star moon sun sky
all all these if you like <?> where </?> they  ' re elements of nature <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#58:1:A>
They  ' re element of nature right

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#59:1:A>
So this case where we may like to call them you may if you like
call them the images call them they  ' re <,> the use of nature images in the
poem right you should know call these images <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#60:1:A>
So uhm I think when last year or when you were in Form Four or Form
Three you pay comparatively more attention to images

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#61:1:A>
But uhm now you may also like to look at the choice of other words
adjectives and verbs so that it may give us more ideas so that it may give us
more dimension in reading a poem right <,> from a viewpoint of lexis from the
viewpoint of <,> the choice of words <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#62:1:A>
Now the next area <,> is the area of grammar <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#63:1:A>
Uhm say for example we may look at the sentence construction <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#64:1:A>
We may look at at sentence construction <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#65:1:A>
Is it indicative <,> is it imperative <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#66:1:A>
Yeah by the way were you know all these are indicative <,>
imperative <,> you know what it is

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#67:1:A>
No <,> I  ' ll I  ' ll explain right <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#68:1:A>
Interrogative or subjunctive <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#69:1:A>
Now imperative it if the sentence is written in a <?> con </?>
imperative form it mean that <?> it  ' s </?> no subjects <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#70:1:A>
That is usually <,> spoken by the teacher

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#71:1:A>
Do this do that go out you shut up <,> keep quiet or <unc>
three words </unc> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#72:1:A>
Keep quiet shut up don't run <,> things like that

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#73:1:A>
In other words like that uhm in the sentence like there is no
subject right only the verb

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#74:1:A>
To begin a sentence with a verb without any subject this is what we
call imperative

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#75:1:A>
Or if you don't like the word <?> were </?> too difficult
imperative

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#76:1:A>
You may say right order it is an order or it is a command right <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#77:1:A>
And of course <?> were </?> this the use of this may <,> may mean
or may suggest power <,> alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#78:1:A>
The one speaking in such a way is actually exercising or using his
power so that the subject is omitted so that the subject is non- existed
alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#79:1:A>
Power very often by the use of imperative is an indication of the
power that  ' s the speaker is using or the power that he is enjoying <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#80:1:A>
So indicative that is the normal sentence that is the normal
sentence pattern right that is you have the subject <?> or </?> verb and then
the object to indicate something to tell you something <?> this </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#81:1:A>
A very factual a very factual sentence with the subject verb object
to tell you something to indicate something to you right

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#82:1:A>
And then <.> interr </.> <,> interrogative that is question <,>
question

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#83:1:A>
You know the word interrogation interrogation means question

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#84:1:A>
You know the word interrogation <,> <unc> one- word </unc>
has a section of interrogation with <unc> three words </unc> <,>
<unc> two-words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#85:1:A>
Interrogation means question

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#86:1:A>
If a sentence is <?> purely </?> written in a question form then
you  ' d better you  ' d better watch up

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#87:1:A>
Or written in subjunctive form you know subjunctive

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#88:1:A>
If I were <,> if I had something something right

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#89:1:A>
Uh these are the areas that we may pay attention to <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#90:1:A>
Or to continue with the sentence construction <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#91:1:A>
Uhm the voice of the sentence <,> the voice of the sentence may
also tell us something <,> that we may <,> notice whether it is written in
active voice or it is written in the passive voice <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#92:1:A>
<?> Say </?> example <,> uhm <,,> I clean the blackboard <,> or the
blackboard is clean <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#93:1:A>
What is the difference between these two sentences

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#94:1:A>
If I say I I clean the blackboard or the blackboard is cleaned

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#95:1:A>
Is there any difference <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#96:1:A>
The difference is that right in the sentence I clean the blackboard
the emphasis is the word I <?> oh </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#97:1:A>
In every sentence the first word <,> is the word which is being
emphasized

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#98:1:A>
So in this case I clean the blackboard means that is I not you

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#99:1:A>
I clean the blackboard whereas the blackboard is cleaned the one
who is cleaning the blackboard the one who who clean that the blackboard is
not important

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#100:1:A>
What is more important is the blackboard <,> right

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#101:1:A>
And that  ' s why it  ' s written in passive voice and the blackboard
is put into the beginning right <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#102:1:A>
Or further example <,,> the passive voice <,> the use of passive
voice very often may imply <,> that person <,> that person is passive <,>
that person is not powerful <,> or that person is weak <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#103:1:A>
And uhm <,> we may also notice sometime <,,> were whether it is
complex sentence <,> or whether it is simple sentence <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#104:1:A>
If it is complex sentence <?> were </?> what kind of complex
sentence <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#105:1:A>
These are the few areas that may that we may find helpful

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#106:1:A>
Or another item is there any inversion <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#107:1:A>
Is there any inversion you know inversion <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#108:1:A>
Or is there any change <,> change of tense within the poem or
within the passage that you are reading

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#109:1:A>
If you notice like there is <,> a sudden change of tense <,> then
you  ' d better watch up <,> you you better be careful and try why and try ask
yourself why is there such a change of tense alright <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#110:1:A>
And <,,> and lastly <,,> lastly and you we may look at uhm <,>
phonology that we say <,> which means <?> were </?> the sound effect

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#111:1:A>
Sound effect or the aspect of sound <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#112:1:A>
Now under this category <unc> one- word </unc> we may look
at alliteration <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#113:1:A>
You know what alliteration is

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#114:1:A>
Alliteration that is <,> the repeated use <,> the repeated use of
the same consonant <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#115:1:A>
In other words right if on one line <,> you get three or four same
consonant at the same time then it may produce a certain kind of sound effect
which is very distinctive to your ear so you can hear it

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#116:1:A>
Now the more frequent one <unc> one-word </unc> one one is
the S sound <,> the S sound the S alliteration

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#117:1:A>
It can be very frequent

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#118:1:A>
The S alliteration <?> were </?> may have several effect

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#119:1:A>
One is this can create a very soft <,> atmosphere or this can
create a sleepy atmosphere or lazy atmosphere <,> or a heavy sound <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#120:1:A>
In other words where it if the poem is about something which is
very quiet <,> right surrounding or the atmosphere which is supposed to be
quiet <,> then you may notice the lot of S sound

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#121:1:A>
But if you if you refer to the poem that you read last year The
Listener that you may find a lot of S there right <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#122:1:A>
And then the L sound the L

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#123:1:A>
The L is again right it is a very light sound <,> it may it may
convey a <,> light <,> or lazy feeling <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#124:1:A>
That  ' s why lazy is spelt as L A Z Y

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#125:1:A>
We get the L sound and the S sound mean it lazy right

<ICE-HK:S1B-020#126:1:A>
The L sound is a very lazy sound </I>
