<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X1:1:Z>
Good evening and welcome to Newsline

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X2:1:Z>
This has been a week of dramatic developments

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X3:1:Z>
First was the publication of the Tiananmen Papers which purport to
reproduce verbatim account of conversations between top Chinese leaders in
the days leading up to the military crackdown in nineteen eighty nine

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X4:1:Z>
This was followed by Chief Secretary Anson Chan  ' s surprise
announcement of the decision of retiring in April

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X5:1:Z>
Tonight we will discuss both of theses issues

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X6:1:Z>
We are fortunate to have with us tonight Professor James Tang Head
of the Department of Politics and Public Administration of The University of
Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X7:1:Z>
And commentator Willy Lam of CNN dot com

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X8:1:Z>
Gentlemen welcome

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X9:1:Z>
Now James let me start with you

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X10:1:Z>
You uh believe Anson Chan  ' s uh statement that she is retiring for
personal reasons </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#11:1:A>
Well given the timing and the circumstances as well as the
reasons I think that she provided I certainly don't think uh they are
particularly convincing

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#12:1:A>
I think uh for uh someone at that position some of the issues that
she raised would have been already considered I think earlier on <{> <[> <,>
</[> when she agree to served uh continue to serve <{> <[> uh with </[> the
uh Chief Executive

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#13:1:A>
And uh so uhm I mean personal reason of course is something
difficult to assess but I think overall uhm I I certainly don't find those
reasons <{> <[> particularly </[> convincing

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X14:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X15:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X16:1:Z>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X17:1:Z>
Uh Willy what do you think </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#18:1:B>
Uhm nor do I

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#19:1:B>
I think it  ' s quite obvious that uhm she  ' s meeting with more
frustrations perhaps uhm both overt and uhm under the table intervention
so-called intervention from Beijing

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X20:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#21:1:B>
So that  ' s why I think uhm she mentioned the fact that there
are people out there to uh drive a wedge <{> <[> between </[> </{> her and
uhm Chief Executive <{> <[> uh </[> Mr Tung

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#22:1:B>
And also uhm the advice she gave to uhm her successor uh be himself
or herself

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X23:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X24:1:Z>
<[> Right </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X25:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#26:1:B>
Uh meaning perhaps that they should be able to uh stand up to
pressure from uhm other parties in Hong Kong

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#27:1:?> Uh right

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#28:1:B>
Including Beijing

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X29:1:Z>
Well do you think there is anything wild events that uh
precipitated uh there  ' s or what is a series cumulative things including uh
may be the Robert Chung enquiry and you know <.> a </.> apparently she wants
it uh Andrew Lo to go and the Chief Executive now didn't ant to do this

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X30:1:Z>
Was it a series of things or was there one thing that cause her to
decide to leave </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#31:1:B>
I guess it could have been a series of things perhaps starting
from uhm this spring of last year when I think the popularity of Tung dropped
to an all time low and Beijing was very anxious to prop up Tung  ' s
administration

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#32:1:B>
And at that time I think there were allegations from uhm anti-Chan
uhm elements that uhm she was a leader of this dumped Tung campaign

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#33:1:B>
And she felt the pressure <{> <[> <,> </[> and then of course with
the Vice-Premier Qian Qichen last September in which uh the Chinese
administration uh apparently said that uhm she did not provide enough support
<{> <[> <,> </[> uh to Tung

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#34:1:B>
Uh so I think those matters sort of were uhm accumulating <{> <[>
uhm </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X35:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X36:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X37:1:Z>
<[> Yes </[> </{> it did </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#38:1:A>
It must be difficult I think for anyone in that position who
actually really uhm should command such authority

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X39:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#40:1:A>
In respect of the entire civil service

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#41:1:A>
And if there are you know tricky issues like that and then if she
make recommendations that are exempted <{> <[> by </[> the Chief Executive
<{> <[> with </[> you know obvious consequences uh for authority I think that
<{> <[> would </[> make things very difficult

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X42:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X43:1:Z>
<[> Um </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X44:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X45:1:Z>
Yes well uh she said at her press conference that as Willy uh
refer uh to this that uh there were people who uh are causing uh problems
between herself and uh the Chief Executive

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X46:1:Z>
Uh and it seems to me that then is a case of whether the Chief
Executive has confidence in her or whether he believes these other people who
was spreading stories about her </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#47:1:A>
Well I think it depends partly on uhm where are the uh
channels of communications uh were

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#48:1:A>
Whether there was a problem not only between Chief Executive and
uhm the Chief Secretary but <{> <[> also </[> uh between Beijing and uh Mrs
Anson Chan

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#49:1:A>
Uhm and these people obviously uh those that she uh did not name
but <{> <[> you know </[> people I think would I think <?> those </?> some of
these were critical of her and who had who visited Beijing <.> ve </.> very
often <{> <[> so </[> is I think it  ' s not only the question of creating
problems between her and the Chief Executive but also between uh Beijing uh
and uh Beijing  ' s trust

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X50:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X51:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X52:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X53:1:Z>
Right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#54:1:A>
Uh of her

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X55:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#56:1:B>
Well obviously uhm I think Beijing approved of her retirement
uhm earlier because uhm Beijing having apparently made the decision that uhm
Tung will be given the second term

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X57:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#58:1:B>
Uhm it  ' s quite clear that there elements both in Beijing and
more importantly in Hong Kong who think that with Anson Chan away from the
scene it might be easier for Tung to uhm consolidate his position and perhaps
improve his popularity in the run- up to next year when uhm they go through
the process of choosing the <{> <[> next </[> uh Chief Executive

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X59:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X60:1:Z>
Well you know when Anson was in Beijing in September uh she also
uh said in public uh to the press that there are people from Hong Kong who
constantly go up to Beijing to talk to Chinese leaders

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X61:1:Z>
And uh Chinese leaders themselves are not that well-informed about
events in Hong Kong and one doesn't know what these people were were telling
the Chinese leaders

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X62:1:Z>
And it seems to me that she felt her position is being undermined
by these people

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X63:1:Z>
Uh do you think that was the case </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#64:1:B>
Of course I did

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#65:1:B>
Uhm I think she has been battling this uh since July first ninety
seven <{> <[> <,> and </[> uhm perhaps in nineteen ninety nine when uhm
Beijing and Tung asked her <.> f </.> uh <.> f </.> to stay for two more
years

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X66:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X67:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#68:1:B>
Perhaps she thought that there might be a chance for her to uh
improve the situation <{> <[> <,> </[> but after uh one year or so I think
she felt perhaps even more frustrated

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X69:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X70:1:Z>
Uhm <.> s </.> uh you think that she felt uh in March ninety nine
when they asked her to stay on that may be finally they they trusted her

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X71:1:Z>
But but now she realised that they still don't trust her

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X72:1:Z>
Is that it </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#73:1:B>
That  ' s a possibility

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#74:1:B>
I think uhm by the time uh of the meeting with Vice- Premier <.> Qi
</.> uh Qian I think uhm she saw the writing on the wall

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#75:1:B>
She saw that uhm even if she want to stay on until uh June uh two o
two

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X76:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#77:1:B>
Uhm she would not have the confidence of Beijing

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#78:1:B>
And uh she said yesterday uhm if uhm <unc> a few words
</unc> doesn't have Beijing  ' s confidence then this would be an an
invitation uh for Beijing to make comments here and there to in effect
intervene <{> <[> perhaps </[> uh <?> worthy </?> or not uh <?> worthy </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#79:1:B>
So I think uhm she made herself quite uh her position quite clear
yesterday

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X80:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X81:1:Z>
You know James uh uh since Tung uh the press conference uh said uh
several times that he wanted her to stay but uh she was uh <unc>
two-words </unc> in uh insisting on resignation

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X82:1:Z>
Uh but if if he really wanted her to stay wouldn't he have gone to
Beijing and told her you mustn't have these suspicions about Anson

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X83:1:Z>
You mustn't listen to other people spreading rumours about her

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X84:1:Z>
Uh you know I trust her and therefore you should trust her too
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#85:1:A>
Well I think the whole uh question is uhm quite uhm uh
interesting if you come to think of you know where the the Chief Executive
should be the one who actually comes out very strongly

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X86:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#87:1:A>
Uh defence of her position

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X88:1:Z>
Right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#89:1:A>
Uh working for the administration

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X90:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#91:1:A>
Uh in this particular case I there uh was of course question
of personality issues and then the question of trust <{> <[> from </[>
Beijing

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#92:1:A>
But in general I think it reflects uh why the issue of the how Hong
Kong the whole administration can effectively communicate <{> <[> <,> </[>
sentiments and issues and problems uh with Beijing

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#93:1:A>
And to what extent uh other groups who with <.> w </.> different
political interest might even have better access <{> <[> <,> to the </[> uh
Beijing Government

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#94:1:A>
And in so uh from the Hong Kong Government side the Chief Executive
is almost the only one

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X95:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X96:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X97:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#98:1:A>
Who would that sort of access

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#99:1:A>
The other channels would be quite sort of you know bureaucratic in
nature

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X100:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#101:1:A>
And how effective

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X102:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#103:1:A>
Uhm the administration as a whole

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X104:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#105:1:A>
Can communicate some of these concerns and issues uhm
directly I think is is a very interesting issue

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X106:1:Z>
Yes so I was thinking uh you know Qian Qichen uh thought that
Anson Chan wasn't supporting Tung enough but isn't uh also true the way
around if Tung had given Anson support she wouldn't have felt that she had to
resign

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X107:1:Z>
Uh <.> W </.> Willy what do you think </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#108:1:B>
Yes it  ' s true

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#109:1:B>
Uh James was saying I think uhm that is no what was established
channel for communication between the SAR uh Government and Beijing

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#110:1:B>
Whereas uh we  ' ve seen I think since last year that the uhm
liaison office of the central government in Hong Kong formerly known as
Xinwah uh seems to have been playing a bigger role

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#111:1:B>
Uh well they were actually uh very low profile I think for the <{>
<[> first </[> two years after July first ninety seven but suddenly perhaps
in an effort to prop up Tung  ' s administration uh the liaison office plus
other members of the so-called leftists <{> <[> exception </[> in Hong Kong
have been playing a more visible and certainly high profile role uh since
last March

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#112:1:B>
And I think that might have in pinch upon uh perhaps Anson  ' s
authority or her sense of uhm her relation with Tung as well as with Beijing

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X113:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X114:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X115:1:Z>
Uhm you know looking at what uhm may have actually precipitated
this I mean anyone uh you know in the event uh I can only think of the uh
forthcoming Fulun Gong convention in Hong Kong you know people from all over
the world will be gathering in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X116:1:Z>
Uh and I think that uh China must be very unhappy about this

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X117:1:Z>
Do you think hat this will be one incident that uh put too much
pressure in Anson <?> that make </?> her to resign

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X118:1:Z>
Either of you </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#119:1:A>
Well uh it  ' s difficult really to pin point particular event
because we don't know what  ' s going on uh behind the scene

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#120:1:A>
But uhm I mean these are some of the issues I think which will
make uhm such uh decision <{> <[> uh </[> possible <{> <[> because </[> uh it
would have major impact on Hong Kong  ' s international image the notion one
country two systems and all a range of other things

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#121:1:A>
Well it does have a lot of implications on mainland China

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X122:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X123:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X124:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#125:1:A>
And Beijing

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#126:1:A>
And if you look at how things are handled

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#127:1:A>
For example in Macau which <{> <[> was </[> definitely not
approved of by international community

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#128:1:A>
Yet at the same time of course you know there  ' s like <{> <[>
people <unc> a few words </unc> </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X129:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X130:1:Z>
<[> But he was </[> </{> he was highly approved <{> <[> by Jiang
Zemin </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#131:1:A>
<[> Yeah yeah </[> </{> that  ' s <{> <[> right </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X132:1:Z>
<[> Right </[> </{> because uh really you remember uh when Jiang
Zemin was in Macau last month he he praised Edmund Ho and uh he might have
played on their names uh you know they both have <unc> one word
</unc> and you that you have you have matters with part of your names so
you are firmer </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#133:1:B>
Right right it  ' s possible

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#134:1:B>
<{1> <[1> I </[1> think Beijing is really very mad about the
activities of the Fulun <{2> <[2> Gong </[2> practitioners in in Macau and
then uh in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#135:1:B>
And what  ' s behind this is the drafting of the Article twenty
three <{3> <[3> which </[3> I think is a time bomb uh the SAR administration

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#136:1:B>
I think uhm many senior civil servants have reservations about the
way uh Article twenty three might be drafted uh clauses which might spell out
what is uh sedition what is anti-government activities <{4> <[4> as well as
</[4> uh relationship with foreign government as well as foreign political
bodies and so forth

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#137:1:B>
So uhm well that is some suggestion that Anson  ' s sudden <.> deci
</.> decision might have to do with the Fulun Gong and the possible uh
promulgation of Article twenty three <{5> <[5> perhaps </[5> you know coming
year or two which might uhm conflict with her own principle of of Hong Kong  ' s
high degree of autonomy

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X138:1:Z>


<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X139:1:Z>
<[1> Uh huh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X140:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X141:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X142:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X143:1:Z>
<[5> Uh huh </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X144:1:Z>
But then what her her successor I mean if uh Donald Tsang becomes
her successor won't he be facing the same problem

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X145:1:Z>
Will he compromise with Chief and refuse to compromise </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#146:1:A>
It could be a time bomb I mean if I mean not only <unc>
one word </unc> I mean even when we look at all the problems uhm we saw
in terms the uhm <&> tut </&> uh laws of our <.> d </.> demonstrations and uh
<.> s </.> uh sort of you know problem created for us and and <.> so </.>
societies as a whole

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#147:1:A>
Uhm and if uhm you know the government has to move on to uhm deal
with this particular <{> <[> issue </[> I think that again I think will
create problems

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X148:1:Z>
<[> Right </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X149:1:Z>
Okay well uh we  ' ve run out of uh time

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X150:1:Z>
We  ' ve to uh take a break

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X151:1:Z>
So before that one final question

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X152:1:Z>
Uh Willy do you think Anson will run for Chief Executive </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#153:1:B>
Uh at this stage no no

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X154:1:Z>
James </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#155:1:A>
I don't think uh for this round but you know who can
<unc> two words </unc> the next round

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X156:1:Z>
Okay thank you very much

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X157:1:Z>
Uh this is the end of the first part

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X158:1:Z>
In the second part we will be about the Tiananmen Papers <?> tune
in </?> </X> <&> A break </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X159:1:Z>
Welcome back in the second half of today  ' s program we  ' re going
to discuss the Tiananmen Papers

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X160:1:Z>
Willy to start off do you think that these papers are authentic

Well of course there  ' s no way of proving it hundred percent
but I was in Beijing from uhm April to June eighty nine

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#162:1:B>
And uh from what we heard at that time I think the general drift
of the drama the decisions as well as the process of decision- making are
shown by the Tiananmen Papers

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#163:1:B>
I think pretty much uhm match with what we heard at that time <{>
<[> and </[> subsequently the uh fews few months afterwards

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#164:1:B>
So I think the uhm the general uhm line of the argument as
presented by the Papers seem quite creditable

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X165:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X166:1:Z>
Now James assuming that theses papers are authentic uh what light
do they shed on events of nineteen eight nine </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#167:1:A>
Well if we look at that and uhm it it seems that actually
most of what had been reviewed are quite consistent <{> <[> <,> with </[>
what we know

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#168:1:A>
And after all some of the people who work directly involved
actually had you know in uh overseas and they had <.> discu </.> discussions
and the positions of the leading uh figures in that episode actually uh had
been uh reported but I think the documents provided greater details

<$Z> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#169:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#170:1:Z>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#171:1:A>
About the consistent positions of uh Li Peng for <{> <[>
example </[> <.> ab </.> about how uhm you know how uh actually Deng Xiao
Ping himself had been such a <.> f </.> powering figure <{> <[> that all </[>
the other senior leaders really uh <.> w </.> were not able to challenge him

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X172:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X173:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{> </X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#174:1:Z>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#175:1:A>
Uh in meetings even though they might have disagreed <{> <[>
with </[> him

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#176:1:A>
Uh so we got a more details and more uh uhm understanding of the
atmosphere and the <{> <[> mood </[> and the trickiness of the situation

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X177:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X178:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X179:1:Z>
Willy well Deng Xiao Ping and the other uh petit elders stepped
in because of politburo standing committee was deadlocked

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X180:1:Z>
Now uh it was deadlocked <unc> two-words </unc> to
abstain he didn't vote

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X181:1:Z>
If he had voted to support Zhao Ziyang and <unc> three words
</unc> uh will then what would have happened would there not have been a
a massacre or would Deng have stepped in anyway </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#182:1:B>
Well first of all I think it was very doubtful whether
<unc> two words </unc> who always seeks an offence I think would have
cast a vote in support of uh <{> <[> Zhao Ziyang </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X183:1:Z>
<[> Or or on </[> </{> uh so <[> if </[> people in the other
direction <{> <[> uh then </[> the elders still uh would have kept out </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#184:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#185:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#186:1:B>
Well I think uhm either way that <?> Zhao </?> voted I think uhm
uh uh the elders uh particularly Deng Xiao Ping uh General <?> Wong Chun </?>
and Yang Shang Kun <{> <[> uh would </[> have prevailed because uh say for
saying I think uhm there was no way for uh the younger members of the
Republic Standing Committee to challenge Deng Xiao Ping

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#187:1:B>
Deng was a a court-like figure

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X188:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X189:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#190:1:B>
And I think Deng had a time had already made up his mind to
perhaps in late uh April to <{> <[> use </[> uhm hardball tactics not
necessarily troops nut uh hardball tactics to <{> <[> crush </[> the what
they perceived as an anti-Beijing movement

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#191:1:B>
So I I don't think matters would have uh uhm developed a different
way

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X192:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X193:1:Z>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#194:1:A>
<{> <[> I think </[> if <unc> two words </unc>
actually wanted to vote against that that would be almost like uhm a decision
by not only him then

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#195:1:A>
It would <{> <[> be </[> a decision by the younger <{> <[> leaders
</[> to basically try to get rid of Deng Xiao Ping

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#196:1:A>
So that would be a I think uh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X197:1:Z>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X198:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X199:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X200:1:Z>
Is he might have ended up under house-arrested </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#201:1:A>
Uh that  ' s right

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X202:1:Z>
Now what do we know about who uh leaks these papers and what is
the purpose and uh why now </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#203:1:A>
Well a lot of uh people have commented on why I mean uh
different conspiracy theories

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#204:1:A>
But I think uh it  ' s <.> pro </.> were not someone really that
senior because when if it is so senior they would be a a well-known figure

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X205:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#206:1:A>
So it would be extremely difficult to hide his identity even
in public

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X207:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#208:1:A>
Uhm but it will be someone of course who would somehow have
access but obviously not direct access I mean he is <.> tal </.> the the uh
compliers are talking about how these information <{> <[> were </[> you know
transcribed and you know <{> <[> there  ' s a process </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X209:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X210:1:Z>
<[> Right well then </[> </{> uh does this the revelation in
these papers does it help or hurt any of the people in the current leadership
</X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#211:1:B>
I think uh as uh the uh compiler himself said uhm he has
hoped that the Paper would generate some support <.> f </.> for reform and I
think that  ' s possible because now we are at the uh trade situation in
Beijing as uh Jiang Zemin and his colleagues and the politburo are preparing
for the <.> s </.> sixteenth party congress

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X212:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#213:1:B>
Uh they will soon start drafting the major documents for the
congress

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X214:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#215:1:B>
Uh one of <.> it </.> its theme would be of course economic
reform but perhaps even political reform

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#216:1:B>
So I think uh the debate which will be generated uh within uh at
least costal intellectuals who advised to <{> <[> internet </[> versions of
the paper uh will be quite uhm a big debate

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#217:1:B>
And perhaps there will be some uhm support for a faster pace of
reform after the sixteenth party congress

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X218:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#219:1:A>
That <{> <[> will </[> be the intention but I think there are
two schools of thought

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X220:1:Z>
<[> But </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X221:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#222:1:A>
That that there are other people who actually uh suggested
that actually that might make the reformers position more difficult <{1> <[1>
because </[1> the conservatives would <{2> <[2> then </[2> try to strengthen
the position and try to uhm you know uh suggest that there will be a
conspiracy against the uhm stability of the political uh I mean the political
<{3> <[3> situation </[3> and also challenge the authority <{1> <[1> and the
core leaders </[1>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X223:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X224:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X225:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#226:1:B>
<[1> Yeah this yup </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#227:1:B>
Right <{> <[> sure </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#228:1:B>
In terms of the personal arrangement I think now uh Li Peng is the
uhm uh senior person who is exposed

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X229:1:Z>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X230:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#231:1:B>
So uh the publication of Paper I think will prompt Li Peng to
put even more emphasis on ensuring that uh people close to him for example
<unc> two words </unc> uh the politburo member in charge of uhm law
enforcement

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X232:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#233:1:B>
Would be given a big promotion

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#234:1:B>
Perhaps promotion into the politburo standing committee in the
sixteenth party congress

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X235:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#236:1:B>
So it  ' s also true that uhm the conservative could use this
as an excuse that the uh Tainanmen Papers have generate already instability
in Beijing and that  ' s why they should cram down on uh further of of
political reform in order to avoid uh further instability

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X237:1:Z>
Is the leaking of these papers a sign of power struggle taking
place within Beijing </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#238:1:A>
Uhm <,> well at least there are people who are unhappy with
the state of uhm political situation

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-037#X239:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-037#240:1:A>
And uh and it was a deliberate attempt I mean I  ' m I  ' m I  ' m
quite convinced that that the publication would have an impact one way or the
other </I>
