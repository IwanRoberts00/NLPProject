<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X2:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#3:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#17:1:A>
Can you look at page one zero five five zero please

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#18:1:A>
Now Mr Ong this is a breakdown of the cost to King Jar uh to to
Stutex based on the invoice prices at dealing on McHeaver  ' s invoices

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#19:1:A>
Lord can that be marked as PE three <,> uh eighty seven

Now Mr Ong perhaps you may also have uh before in front of you

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X39:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#40:1:A>
Mr Ong the cost value in uhm the breakdown at page one zero
five five zero can you confirm that they are the cost as invoiced by McHeaver
in in the invoices which you have just been shown

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X41:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#42:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#43:1:A>
And do you accept that the exchange rate of three dollars sixty
five Hong Kong dollar with one Singaporean dollar was about five to eight in
June nineteen eighty in uh June May June July nineteen eighty seven

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X44:1:Z>
I don't know </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#45:1:A>
And there was refer to you you said earlier uh uh confirmed
earlier on that uh there was not too much fluctuation in the <,> uh unit
price invoice price either in nineteen eighty six and September nineteen

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X46:1:Z>
Sales price </X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#51:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#52:1:A>
Almost the same

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#53:1:A>
They  ' re the same throughout <.> du </.> during this period <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#54:1:A>
And the cost of thirty two dollars eighty five cents Hong Kong <,>
to Stutex Hong Kong

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X55:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#56:1:A>
And sold at <,> something like forty four dollars after the
discount

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X57:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#58:1:A>
Still lead to a a good profit margin does it

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#59:1:A>
Well over a twenty percent profit

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X60:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#61:1:A>
Yes <&> A long pause </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#62:1:A>
And do you accept that eighteen percent profit is quite good

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X63:1:Z>
Eighteen percent </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#64:1:A>
Gross profit yes

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X65:1:Z>
Gross profit </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#66:1:A>
Yes

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X67:1:Z>
Do I accept that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#68:1:A>
Yes it  ' s quite good

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#69:1:A>
This one

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X70:1:Z>
Business want to get as much as profit </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#71:1:A>
Okay

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X72:1:Z>
Perhaps so I cannot tell it  ' s good or not </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#73:1:A>
But certainly you accept that at a cost of <.> s </.> thirty
two dollars eighty five cents to Stutex and sold at forty four a a <,> a
profit for of well over eighty percent is made on that

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X74:1:Z>
The thirty two dollar eighty five cents that had bit upon you five
five zero <,> does not include the trucking from port to port charges

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X75:1:Z>
Port charges <unc> one word </unc> charges if any
documentation <unc> one word </unc> for documentation declaration
unloading <,> so thirty two eighty five cents as appeared in one zero five
five zero does not appear as the true cost itself </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#76:1:A>
Uh what is the true cost then according to you per unit

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X77:1:Z>
I know that it  ' s not true cost </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#78:1:A>
Well what is the true cost then according to <{> <[> your </[>
<unc> two words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#79:1:A>
Am I <{> <[> correct </[>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X80:1:Z>
<[> I didn't </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X81:1:Z>
<[> I </[> </{> can of course work it out

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X82:1:Z>
You don't you <{> <[> want me </[> to

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X83:1:Z>
So if if you if you <.> s </.> ask me eighteen percent <,> gross
profit is a group profit I cannot answer that question whether it  ' s good or
it  ' s not good <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X84:1:Z>
Eighty percent is the money equal paying the gross profit </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#85:1:A>
<[> Work it out </[> </{> <&> A long pause </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X86:1:Z>
Besides the decimal </X> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#87:1:A>
Referring to certain goods to be supplied <,> yours you were
happy with a an eighteen percent gross profit

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X88:1:Z>
Uh I cannot recall you know refresh my memory of these </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#89:1:A>
Perhaps you can look at page one zero five one <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#90:1:A>
Is that a fax sent by you to uh <,> the first defendant on the
twenty three nineteen eighty seven

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X91:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#92:1:A>
Yes <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#93:1:A>
Now <.> pro </.> probably you see paragraph A is in <.> s </.>
paragraph A <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#94:1:A>
<quote> If the reduced maximum twelve twelve point five percent
discount this will loosely leave us about eighteen percent for Hong Kong and
Singapore

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#95:1:A>
However please adjust discount yourself </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#96:1:A>
That is what you said <{> <[> right </[>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X97:1:Z>
<[> Yes </[> </{> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#98:1:A>
Yes <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#99:1:A>
So you were then happy to reduce for that particular transaction to
reduce <,> uh uh to offer a maximum discount of twelve point five percent <,>
right

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X100:1:Z>
Yes it was discussed </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#101:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#102:1:A>
That you were happy to leave eighteen percent profit for both Hong
Kong and Singapore right

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X103:1:Z>
Yes but the <{> <[> having </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#104:1:A>
<[> And </[> </{> left to the <.> defend </.> to the first

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X105:1:Z>
Yes having seen these <,> you refer to three one three seven
China merchants </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#106:1:A>
Yes

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X107:1:Z>
These project collaborators had discussed I assume

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X108:1:Z>
This is my reply </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#109:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#110:1:A>
Sorry you assume this is your reply

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#111:1:A>
Are you saying this <{> <[> was you </[>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X112:1:Z>
<[> The reply </[> </{> to this job three one three <{> <[> seven
China </[> merchant

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X113:1:Z>
That I assume this is the reply <,> to this job

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X114:1:Z>
But King Jar we never discusses

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X115:1:Z>
Is that the table we were able to discuss this job could have
been payment due thirty days </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#116:1:A>
<[> Yeah yeah </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#117:1:A>
Yes

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X118:1:Z>
This will be a special job which eventually led us <unc> two
words </unc> but other jobs

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X119:1:Z>
You only goes through one point

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X120:1:Z>
This job was never discussed at all

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X121:1:Z>
I don't know of King Jar <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X122:1:Z>
As I  ' ve said to the best of my recollection Stutex of Hong Kong
never offer an extended term of six-monthly in full payment </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#123:1:A>
Now Mr Ong <,> for most for virtually most of the sales that
made in Hong Kong you were happy to leave it to the first defendant <,> to
<,> decide <,> what price to ask for <,> when that they cerate what discount
to be allowed is that right

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#124:1:A>
Because he is the person who looks after the day-to-day management
of the Hong Kong side of the business <O> Cantonese translation </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X125:1:Z>
That is right but discuss

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X126:1:Z>
Mr Lau discuss </X> <O> Cantonese translation </O>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X127:1:Z>
Yeah what  ' s that mean <unc> a few words </unc> </X> <O>
Recording fast-forwards </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#128:1:A>
So is not in the same <,> fax sent out by you you indicated
you were able to supply six containers every month up until January nineteen
eighty eight

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X129:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#130:1:A>
Yes

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X131:1:Z>
But <{> <[> but </[> only with certain reservation

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X132:1:Z>
You would I  ' m sure you should call it after the argument you
know this agreement it is one way to assure him that business can continue as
usual <,> although it slow down

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X133:1:Z>
The usual statistic </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#134:1:A>
<[> But </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#135:1:A>
You in this case assured the first defendant that you would be
able to supply six containers per month

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X136:1:Z>
Uh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#137:1:A>
Till January the eighth

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#138:1:A>
Is that right

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X139:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#140:1:A>
Yes <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#141:1:A>
If there was already a source of supply in Hong Kong which fulfil
the contract you still expect the first defendant to discuss with you about
sourcing

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X142:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#143:1:A>
Having told him earlier that uh so called I can give you six
containers per month

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#144:1:A>
At least your position as you understood

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X145:1:Z>
We discussed all major contracts Mr Lau </X> <&> A long pause
</&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#146:1:A>
Well Mr Ong perhaps I can ask you to read page one zero five
four nine <,> of the cost on McHeaver invoice price in assessing price

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#147:1:A>
You see well you don't have it <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#148:1:A>
Now uhm this table is is stretched out this way uh total items
that in invoice number four one five six four one five eight four two one
nine are added together <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#149:1:A>
Your Honour can you see the first line it says invoice King Jar uh
three invoices

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X150:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#151:1:A>
That is a May invoice uh so-called uh something over one one
million dollars <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#152:1:A>
And then under the second  ' s column we have the quantity stated

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#153:1:A>
The second third and fourth columns the quantity stated in the
invoices

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#154:1:A>
And then the fifth column the total above of the three invoices

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#155:1:A>
And then you have the selling price as stated in the invoice

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#156:1:A>
And then the next column with an we have the total being the
selling price times the total quantity

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#157:1:A>
Then we have the unit cost to <.> McHea </.> uh to Stutex Hong
Kong as worked out at page one zero five five zero

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#158:1:A>
And the last column we worked out the the cost of all the items
sold

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#159:1:A>
And then <,> uhm we missed the uh there is an amount for the five
percent discount

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#160:1:A>
And then we add the twelve percent handling charge as appears in
McHeaver  ' s invoices

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#161:1:A>
I suppose that would take care of trucking <?> outlay </?>
</unc> all the rest administrative <.> ad </.> administration expenses

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#162:1:A>
Then we have a total invoice price of one million three hundred
and fifty two dollars and fifty five cents for the three invoices

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#163:1:A>
Cost of one million three hundred and forty one <,> but leaving a
profit of three hundred fifty one thousand seven hundred and fourteen dollars

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#164:1:A>
Being twenty six percent of the selling price

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#165:1:A>
Now uh would you dispute the correctness of this table first

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#166:1:A>
The capital interest

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#167:1:A>
Calculator <unc> two words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#168:1:A>
Uh you have one do you

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X169:1:Z>
<unc> a few words </unc> able to comment <unc> a few
words </unc> without </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#170:1:A>
Uh just just the cost of sale

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#171:1:A>
The cost of the sale uh subtracted from the sale in the actual
invoice selling price <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#172:1:A>
Without adding administration over head expanses

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X173:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#174:1:A>

I do not run the day-to-day business </X>

Now will you look at page one zero five uh <,> one zero <,,>
page one zero five five eight B <&> recording fast-forwards </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#253:1:A>
Mr Ong now this is not an invoice uh issued by Stutex but uh by
China Overseas to Stutex <O> Cantonese translation </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#254:1:A>
Can uh can this be <.> m </.> be marked PD three ninety six B
the translation

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X255:1:Z>
This <unc> a few words </unc> </X>

<$A>

Yes and the the origin <.> tran </.> translation will be

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#257:1:A>
Now perhaps they can be marked now as PD three ninety six A

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#258:1:A>
Uh that is stage one zero five five eight A

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#259:1:A>
That that is the original Chinese

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#260:1:A>
The translation is at page one zero five five eight B

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X261:1:Z>
Yes <,,> so one zero five five eight A is three nine six A is it
that section </X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#265:1:A>
I think for Your Honours that is all my opinion and we go to PD

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X266:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#267:1:A>
Now this invoice uh is for the transport of a hundred and
thirty numbers of seventeen hundred frame and ten connectors

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X268:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#269:1:A>
Provide China <.> O </.> from China Overseas Development

Yes </X> <O> Cantonese translation </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#271:1:A>
Uhm and then the the cost is five hundred and fifty

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#272:1:A>
Five hundred and seventy

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#273:1:A>
The <.> in </.> the price invoice is five hundred and seventy

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X274:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#275:1:A>
Now do you find this uh uh an overcharge or did did did you
find this uh about about <,> uh uh vague <,> uh charge for for the services
provided

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X276:1:Z>
I have no comment because <{> <[> I had </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#277:1:A>
<[> You have </[> </{> no

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X278:1:Z>
Just just just such a </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#279:1:A>
You  ' re not <O> Cantonese translation </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#280:1:A>
Well if that is your position then uh perhaps I <.> trou </.>
I  ' ll just trouble you with looking at two more documents

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#281:1:A>
One zero five five seven <,> and one zero five five eight

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#282:1:A>
Now Mr Ong one zero five five seven is a schedule work out on this
basis that on uh at the first <.> col </.> uh second column you have the
selling price to King Jar

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#283:1:A>
And the third column we add the transportation cost

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#284:1:A>
Do you remember in the King Jar invoice <O> overlaps unclear
Cantonese translation </O>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#285:1:A>
It says transportation cost not included so we add transportation
cost to arrive at a price which would have been charged if transportation
cost was added

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#286:1:A>
Do I suppose if you uh you cannot comment on the transportation
cost you cannot comment on this

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X287:1:Z>
You  ' re correct right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#288:1:A>
But if the the cost of transporting two hundred and forty
numbers of frame uh instead of five hundred and fifty if that is so then
would you accept that the price including delivery to cite would be as uh <,>
as stated in the fourth column

<$Z?> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X289:1:Z>
Is able </X>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X290:1:Z>
Well I cannot comment on the charges they depends on the </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#291:1:A>
Pardon

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X292:1:Z>
Condition uh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#293:1:A>
Very well

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#294:1:A>
Your Honour one o five five seven can that be marked as PD five
nine three ninety five A

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X295:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#296:1:A>
And the <,,> one zero five five eight Your Honour is is
another <.> ana </.> analysis which adds thirty five percent with the based
on Mr Ong  ' s succession which is twenty five percent

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#297:1:A>
And then so we just add twenty five percent on

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#298:1:A>
But I I don't think I <,> I can I can put this in Ong  ' s since he
he he he cannot comment on transportation cost so I  ' ll just leave it at that

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#299:1:A>
And uh I will leave to if you bare with me uh My Lord

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X300:1:Z>
No uhm <,,> so you are <unc> a few words </unc> want to
use one o five five eight <unc> a few words </unc> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#301:1:A>
No since I haven't ask him upon <{> <[> if I </[> it it would
it would mix you Your Honour  ' s record with this

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#302:1:A>
I hope you understand

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#303:1:A>
So I  ' ll leave it

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#304:1:A>
I  ' ll leave it

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X305:1:Z>
<[> You  ' re right </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X306:1:Z>
Okay </X> <&> A long pause </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#307:1:A>
Now Mr Ong can you look at page one zero five five nine <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#308:1:A>
Now Mr Ong this uh can this be marked as PD three ninety seven
Your Honour

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X309:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#310:1:A>
Now this schedule is prepared by working on the selling price
to King Jar in their invoice and marked it up and and add <.> twen </.>
twenty five percent

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#311:1:A>
Uh on on your evidence that it was <,> sold in less than twenty
five percent of the market price

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#312:1:A>
Can you see the figure work out is for nineteen thirty frames
eighty <unc> one word </unc> without eighty dollars seventeen hundred
seventeen hundred sixty two dollars eighty cents as is shown that

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#313:1:A>
Now would you accept Mr Ong that in <,> there had never been a
sales by Stutex at a price as listed in the last column the right hand last
column adhering this schedule

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X314:1:Z>
I cannot recall the scene such if so I have no idea </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#315:1:A>
No no

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#316:1:A>
Uh if you cannot <.> re </.>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#317:1:A>
Fair enough though

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#318:1:A>
But you you you can't say that there there has ever been a sale at
such a high price <,> that you know of

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X319:1:Z>
I cannot say no nor nor can I say yes because I  ' m not not sure
to say whether that this is or not </X>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X320:1:Z>
Are you familiar with the selling prices you have had

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X321:1:Z>
Is this that the <{> <[> uh well </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#322:1:A>
<[> But </[> </{> in in your schedule which you have produced
has never come up to as <,> uh as higher price as that

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#323:1:A>
Do you remember

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X324:1:Z>
If I I do not know on what basis it was work worked out

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X325:1:Z>
You cannot mark up on <,> to to investment on the

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X326:1:Z>
You cannot mark up

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X327:1:Z>
It can only a profit on transportation

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X328:1:Z>
When you mark up you mark up on </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#329:1:A>
Now let let me explain how this is work out Mr Ong

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#330:1:A>
You said that the that the price sold to King of the good sold to
King Jar was twenty five percent less than the market price right

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X331:1:Z>
They are about <{> <[> yes </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#332:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{> so what would have been the market price
would be the price sold to King Jar divided by seventy five percent

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#333:1:A>
That that would that that would be worked it out what you say
would be the market price

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X334:1:Z>
When we <{> <[> mark up we mark up </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#335:1:A>
<[> Is as simple as that </[> </{>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X336:1:Z>
But if when you mark up if not now it  ' s not twenty five anymore
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#337:1:A>
This is <,> this is simple arithmetics

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#338:1:A>
If you say that it was less than twelve <,> less than five <,>
twenty five percent less than the market price than it work it <.> wo </.> it
works to <,> the price as stated in the invoice then in order to find what
would have been the market price is a very simple mathematic exercise

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#339:1:A>
You divide by the price of King Jar by seventy five percent

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#340:1:A>
You divide it by point seventy five <,> you see

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#341:1:A>
And it and and and the quotient if you <,> multiple by seventy
five percent would come to the price of the King Jar

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#342:1:A>
<.> Ver </.> very simple mathematic exercise

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#343:1:A>
That is how these figures at the last column will work out

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#344:1:A>
I just want to show and suggest to you that the price sold to King
Jar was nothing like twenty five percent less than market price because <O>
Cantonese translation </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#345:1:A>
Throughout Stutex  ' s transactions there had never been a
<unc> one word </unc> at the price as listed in in last column of
this schedule fax to

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#X346:1:Z>
You have not less </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-062#347:1:A>
<unc> a few words </unc> uh I think you don't want to
say that because a five percent discount is allowed on the King Jar invoice

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#348:1:A>
Uhm the figure sixty forty seven forty five want to have been
multiplied by point nine five

<ICE-HK:S1B-062#349:1:A>
<{> <[> And </[> there was only uh uh other that figure they <{>
<[> have </[> been divided by <{> <[> point seventy five </[>
