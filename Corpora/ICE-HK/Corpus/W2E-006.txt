<h> <bold> Partnership of peace </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#2:1>
George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin have not shut the door on their
nuclear eras , but instead fostered hope that such a day may eventually dawn .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#3:1>
The signing by the US President and his Russian counterpart
yesterday of the Treaty of Moscow nuclear disarmament pact was hailed by the
Bush administration as &ldquo; landmark &rdquo; and &ldquo; historic &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#4:1>
It was only the latter of these , a breakthrough in relations that
have been steadily warming . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#5:1>
Landmark it was not .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#6:1>
The threat of the former bitter rivals one day firing nuclear missiles
at one another has been put aside by handshakes and smiles .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#7:1>
Their arsenals remain active and although not as threatening , can
still be mobilised . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#8:1>
In 2012 , each will have about 2,000 active nuclear warheads and
another 6,000 in storage .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#9:1>
This is not disarmament , merely rearranging the war-readiness
deckchairs . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#10:1>
What has not been achieved through treaties has been gained
through photo-opportunities .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#11:1>
Mr Bush and Mr Putin are good friends and they clearly would like the
same for their countries , despite the lingering Cold War suspicions of many
of their citizens . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#12:1>
Spy scandals and angry words over the American plans for a
missile defence shield have fuelled doubts that the relationship can ever be
completely pulled from the dark days of Cold War loathing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#13:1>
But the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US and Russia  ' s
stagnant economy have created an atmosphere where co-operation is mutually
beneficial . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#14:1>
Washington gets Moscow  ' s diplomatic leverage over troublespots ,
ranging from the Middle East to Central Asia and the so-called &ldquo; axis
of evil &rdquo; states of Iran , Iraq and North Korea .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#15:1>
Russia gets badly-needed economic incentives , such as promises of
increased investment and aid and support in its aims of joining the World
Trade Organisation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#16:1>
It is a friendship based on necessity , but one which , given
time , has ramifications beyond the bilateral partnership it now encompasses .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#17:1>
On Tuesday , Russia also forms a new partnership with the 19
countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation , which include the US .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#18:1>
While there is doubt whether this is as significant an event as it is
being billed , it is another step in Russia moving closer towards the West .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#19:1>
The collapse of the former Soviet Union created instability that
has not been fully calmed .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#20:1>
Russian co-operation with the US and Nato will help bring peace to
these trouble-spots . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#21:1>
The US and Russia must make efforts to cut their nuclear
stockpiles and banish the threat they pose . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#22:1>
But they should also strengthen their new-found partnership to
tackle global threats such as terrorism .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#23:1>
With resolve , they can make the world less dangerous . </p>

<h> <bold> The bird-flu risks </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#25:2>
The report by the special investigation team set up to examine
the bird flu outbreak earlier this year produced no real surprises .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#26:2>
This was largely because most of its recommendations had been leaked
to the media before publication . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#27:2>
Nevertheless , the report does serve as a useful tool to
underline the stark choice Hong Kong faces in its fight to contain avian flu
and , more importantly , to prevent the creation of a mutated virus that is
able to leap the species barrier and infect humans , as happened in 1997 .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#28:2>
Few people can any longer doubt the terrible danger represented by
this possibility .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#29:2>
The human version of bird flu does not consist of the symptoms of a
severe cold . It is gruesome . And it kills . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#30:2>
Many experts predict that an outbreak in humans caused by a
mutated avian flu virus is just a matter of time .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#31:2>
And they warn that should such a virus really take hold , we can
expect the kind of global pandemic that killed tens of millions of people at
the end of World War I .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#32:2>
Except that this time , because of air travel , the speed the disease
could spread globally would be measured in hours rather than weeks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#33:2>
The investigation team  ' s report states the facts bluntly: if
chickens continue to be freshly slaughtered in wet markets , there will
always be a risk of an outbreak of bird flu , and a subsequent risk to humans .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#34:2>
The financial cost to Hong Kong of maintaining its traditional
way of selling chickens are enormous .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#35:2>
The risks will be even greater .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#36:2>
As painful as the decision will be for the Government , and as
unpopular as it will be with many people , it is time for Hong Kong to join
the first world .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#37:2>
The sale of live chickens in wet markets must be banned . </p>

<h> <bold> Secrecy must go </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#39:3>
Inevitably , each time the results of the benchmark tests for
English teaching are released debate centres on two areas: whether there
should be testing at all and what the results actually tell us about the
standards of English teaching .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#40:3>
The argument in favour of the tests is straightforward and
overwhelming .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#41:3>
There is simply no reason why teachers in mid-career should not be
examined to discover whether their teaching ability is up to standard , as it
was at the start of their careers .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#42:3>
There are few checks on classroom performance after a teacher has
qualified and this is simply not reasonable and is at odds with the private
sector where employees ' performances are constantly monitored . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#43:3>
Parents and pupils will be reassured by checks and problem areas
can be identified .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#44:3>
The tests are not to wheedle out weak teachers - although this is one
inevitable , and justifiable , result .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#45:3>
Instead , they should be regarded as a valid method of maintaining ,
and raising , standards of English teaching . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#46:3>
This year  ' s results show , once again , that problem areas are
the writing element of the benchmark test and also , this year in particular
, the comprehension part .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#47:3>
These shortcomings need to be addressed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#48:3>
Unfortunately , when we consider what the results of the tests
tell us about standards of teaching , the answer has to be a blunt , not much .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#49:3>
This is simply because of the way the Government chooses to collect
and release the data . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#50:3>
Presumably in an attempt to avoid upsetting teachers who feel
threatened by the tests , the specific number of serving teachers who were
examined is not released .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#51:3>
This year , this has had the unfortunate effect of making it appear
as though teaching standards are falling because the results in certain areas
were so poor compared to last year .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#52:3>
And yet all we know is that at least 266 of the 826 people who sat
the test were serving teachers .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#53:3>
As a method of discovering how good the standard of teaching is ,
this is far from satisfactory .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#54:3>
Yet , intriguingly , we also know that , of those teachers who opted
for classroom assessment , 90 per cent were successful .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#55:3>
Even allowing for the fact that those who choose this test will be
those who know themselves to be competent , this result appears to be
reassuring .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#56:3>
What is needed , however , is for the secrecy to be removed and a
clear breakdown of results to be released .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#57:3>
Only in this way can problem areas be effectively tackled and the
tests be regarded as truly valid . </p>

An intensified campaign by US President George W . Bush  ' s
administration to bolster support for its war against terrorism has come to
Asia .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#60:4>
The principles being outlined by Mr Bush  ' s envoy are worthy , but
there must surely be implications that must be considered carefully . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#61:4>
Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz  ' s visit to the region
follows on the heels of Mr Bush  ' s European tour , which was met with only a
lukewarm official response . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#62:4>
Asian defence ministers meeting in Singapore this weekend will
doubtless show a little more enthusiasm , given some of their governments'
eagerness for US help in climbing from an economic malaise .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#63:4>
Indonesia , for one , stands to benefit from a planned resumption of
American military assistance .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#64:4>
The Philippines has already won economic aid and military assistance
to fight Muslim separatists . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#65:4>
Mr Bush used the same approach in Russia last week , offering
President Vladimir Putin financial incentives for aiding the anti-terrorism
campaign . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#66:4>
Europe  ' s economic giants of Germany , France and Italy were not
so easily swayed .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#67:4>
They have little need for financial help from the US in fighting a
war that is of little consequence to their stable societies . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#68:4>
The lessons of Afghanistan are still being learned .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#69:4>
The war there has been costly and apart from toppling a hated regime
, has not restored the promised stability or even destroyed the Taleban or
al-Qaeda terrorist network . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#70:4>
Mr Wolfowitz yesterday compared the battle with terrorism to
Nazism in Germany in the 1930s .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#71:4>
By ridding the world of the scourge now , he argued , would prevent
the emergence of a far worse scenario in the future . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#72:4>
He is right , but he must also more clearly define US objectives .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#73:4>
The war against terrorism is ill-defined .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#74:4>
After Afghanistan comes Iraq and then perhaps Iran and North Korea ,
the other countries named by Mr Bush as an &ldquo; axis of evil" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#75:4>
These may be objectionable regimes to Mr Bush and his advisers ,
but not all nations see things the American way . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#76:4>
Mr Bush and his envoys can tour the world seeking opinions , but
there is a forum - the United Nations - which is better suited to discuss and
act upon such important matters . </p>

The political battle over the planned cut in civil service wages
is hotting up .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#79:5>
Unions and politicians who argue civil servants are taking the fall
for a dogmatic commitment to balanced budgets are staking out their ground .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#80:5>
It is easy to forget the wider issues at stake .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#81:5>
Yet half a world away in New York this week the hard edge underlying
Financial Secretary Antony Leung Kam-chung  ' s commitment to restore fiscal
balance within five years was under scrutiny . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#82:5>
Credit rating agencies are a vital audience for any finance chief .
When you are running a record budget deficit that shows little sign of
improving , they are especially so .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#83:5>
Meeting the major players , Mr Leung reiterated his timetable for
restoring order to government accounts .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#84:5>
The message was the same as in his March Budget speech .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#85:5>
But having received it directly , the agencies will be expecting him
to deliver . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#86:5>
The self-appointed guardians of global credit worthiness are
rightly under the microscope due to their perceived lack of accountability .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#87:5>
Last week , the Japanese Government demanded that Moody  ' s provide
more information on the reasons for its downgrade of the country  ' s sovereign
rating . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#88:5>
Yet the reality is that international investors allocate funds
and categorise risk on the basis of the economic health checks provided by
ratings agencies .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#89:5>
Until recently Hong Kong had the luxury of making public spending
choices without worrying about credit issues .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#90:5>
Large fiscal surpluses earned during the 1990s meant concerns centred
on the SAR  ' s political autonomy and commitment to maintain the fixed
exchange rate system . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#91:5>
That has now changed and policy choices are constrained by
outsiders ' perceptions of the Government  ' s long-term solvency .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#92:5>
Former United States president Bill Clinton famously exploded when
advisers told him that his first-term spending initiatives were untenable as
investors would inevitably sell government bonds and force up the cost of
borrowing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#93:5>
Hong Kong still has fiscal reserves of &dollar;363.7 billion .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#94:5>
Yet , without firm action to reign in what has been officially dubbed
a structural deficit , the Government faces a similar market-imposed
straitjacket . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#95:5>
Of course , seeking the blessing of New York credit agencies is
not the main reason for cutting civil servants ' pay .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#96:5>
That is justified on fairness grounds as wage differentials between
the public and private sector widen due to continuing deflation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#97:5>
However , as what is sure to be an acrimonious debate unfolds ,
it is worth keeping in mind the international dimension .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#98:5>
Hong Kong is a small , open economy that must live by its wits to
stay competitive .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#99:5>
If we fail to take action to put our accounts in order the goodwill
built up over so many years by international investors could be quickly lost .

<h> <bold> Time for a trim </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#101:6>
With a massive overhang of empty flats on private housing
estates , the Government  ' s decision to sell only about 5,000 Home Ownership
Scheme units over the next 12 months should help stabilise the market . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#102:6>
House prices have fallen for five years , forcing many home
owners into the negative equity pit .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#103:6>
With about 50,000 new flats due to be completed over the next two
years , sensible steps need to be taken to arrest further erosion of values .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#104:6>
The expansion of the loan scheme for buyers of private flats is
another confidence-boosting measure .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#105:6>
Even with this shot in the arm , prices are unlikely to climb back
to the hysterical levels recorded in 1997 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#106:6>
From 2005/06 , the plan is to control supply of HOS flats at
about 2,000 a year , reflecting the Government  ' s commitment to maintain a
residual capacity to intervene in the market .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#107:6>
Such intervention , though theoretically undesirable , may be
necessary over the medium-term as developers have launched few new
constructions over the past few years and an under-supply could possibly
emerge several years down the road . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#108:6>
As a means of rectifying the administration  ' s failure to
engineer a soft landing for the housing market - what it did after the
handover actually aggravated the plunge - the measures being taken to prop up
the market are justified . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-006#109:6>
Over the long-term , however , Hong Kong  ' s housing policy
remains muddled .

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#110:6>
Will we still need the HOS , or even the home purchase loan scheme
, in 10 years ?

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#111:6>
And should not the public rental housing scheme providing
accommodation to half the population be scaled down or privatised ?

<ICE-HK:W2E-006#112:6>
It  ' s time the government trimmed down its direct involvement in
housing . </p>
