<h> <bold> <ul> ESSAY TOPIC :

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#3:1>
DO YOU THINK CLASSICAL CONDITIONING , OPERANT CONDITIONING , OR
OBSERVATIONAL LEARNING PLAYS A MORE IMPORTANT ROLE IN HUMAN LEARNINGS ?

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#4:1>
GIVE EXAMPLES . </ul> </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#5:1>
<p> Learning is very important .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#6:1>
It starts when you are still a baby .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#7:1>
Besides the inborn behaviour , people need to learn so many things in
everyday life .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#8:1>
Walking , speaking writing , all of these are needed to learn .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#9:1>
In fact , all of us have so many chances to learn different subjects .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#10:1>
This time , we will focus on three types of learning and discuss
which one of these three types of learning plays a more important role in
human learning .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#11:1>
They are classical conditioning , operant conditioning and
observational learning .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#12:1>
Before discussing their importance , we must define what they are
first .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#13:1>
There is some background information about them . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#14:1>
<p> Classical conditioning is a type of teaming in which stimulus acquires
the capacity to evoke a response that was originally evoke by another
stimulus .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#15:1>
Phobias , irrational fears of specific objects or situations , may be
a good example of classical conditioning .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#16:1>
If you had bitten by a dog when you are a child , you may be afraid
of dogs after this event .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#17:1>
Moreover , your fear may spill over to all types of dog , not just
the one biting you .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#18:1>
In this case , your fear is caused by classical conditioning .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#19:1>
This is also an example of stimulus generalization .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#20:1>
<p> Ivan <-> Pavlon </-> <+> Pavlov </+> , was the first person studying
about classical conditioning in 1903 .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#21:1>
His demonstration was about the salivating of dog .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#22:1>
He noticed that dogs accustomed to the procedure would start
salivating before the meat powder was presented .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#23:1>
These are considered as unconditioned stimulus and unconditioned
response and they occur without previous conditioning .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#24:1>
Ivan then used the ringing of a bell as another stimulus to be paired
as a presentation with the meat powder .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#25:1>
After a number of times , he found that the dogs responded by
salivating to the sound of bell alone .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#26:1>
So , the sound of the bell is considered as conditioned stimulus ,
which occurs because of previous conditioning .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#27:1>
In the first example of classical conditioning , the bite by the dog
, the unconditioned stimulus is the pain caused by the bite and the
conditioned stimulus is dog .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#28:1>
The responses of fear is considered as both unconditioned and
conditioned responses , depending on which stimulus it refer to . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#29:1>
<p> There are many other kinds of example of classical conditioning besides
phobias .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#30:1>
In learning process , the unconditioned stimulus is the reinforcing
stimulus while the conditioned responses is the learned responses .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#31:1>
There is a one-to-one or biological relation between them .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#32:1>
The conditioned responses in classical conditioning is determined by
the biological nature of the unconditioned stimulus because the conditioned
responses is a derivative of the unconditioned responses elicited by the
unconditioned stimulus .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#33:1>
Therefore , the change of unconditioned stimulus &obrack; reinforcer
&cbrack; will lead the conditioned responses &obrack; learned responses
&cbrack; change .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#34:1>
In classical conditioning , the typical kinds of responses are
involuntary and reflex responses . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#35:1>
<p> Besides classical conditioning , there is another form of
conditioning-operant conditioning , a form of learning in which voluntary
responses come to be controlled by their consequences .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#36:1>
Compared with classical conditioning , operant conditioning plays a
more important role in human learning since it governs a larger share of
human behaviour .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#37:1>
It is not difficult to understand as all of us know that most human
responses are voluntary rather than reflexive . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#38:1>
<p> B. F. Skinner conducted some deceptively simple research on operant
conditioning in the 1930  ' s .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#39:1>
The fundamental principle of operant conditioning introduced is that
organisms tend to repeat those responses that are followed by favorable
consequences .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#40:1>
In Skinner  ' s experiment , rats and pigeons were used as subjects .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#41:1>
They were placed in an operant chamber that bas come to be better
known as a &ldquo; Skinner box &rdquo; alone .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#42:1>
In &ldquo; Skinner box &rdquo; , a specific response was
systematically recorded while the consequences of the response were
controlled .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#43:1>
Meanwhile , a small bit of food was given to the subjects when they
made the designated response , pressing a small lever mounted on one side
wall for rats and pecking a small disk mounted on one side wall for pigeons .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#44:1>
After a period of time , Skinner found that the response rate of
subjects rapidly increased .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#45:1>
This rapid increase indicated that the subjects had learned the
designated responses . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#46:1>
<p> In everyday life , operant conditioning play an important role .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#47:1>
The majority of teaming is voluntary and people often learn tasks
since they are attracted by the consequences that they know before learning
the tasks .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#48:1>
Studying is a typical example that people use to explain how operant
conditioning plays its role in human learning .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#49:1>
Clearly , studying is not a reflex response , people working hard in
studying since the stimulus events followed that studying , may be some
rewards from parents , admiration from others or getting a good job in future .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#50:1>
<p> The last type of learning discussed is observational learning , it occurs
when an organism  ' s responding is influenced by the observation of others ,
who are called models .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#51:1>
Albert Bandura &obrack; 1977-1986 &cbrack; has investigate it
extensively .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#52:1>
In fact , learning through observation accounts for a great deal of
learning in both animals and humans .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#53:1>
In order to learn through observation , you must pay attention to
another person  ' s behaviour and its consequence first .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#54:1>
Then , retention is also important , you must store a mental
representation of what you have seen .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#55:1>
Finally , the last two processes are reproduction and motivation .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#56:1>
Reproduction is converting your stored mental images into overt
behaviour while motivation is your encounter of which situation you believe
that the response is likely to pay off for you . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#57:1>
<p> Observational learning is important since it can explain why animals can
also learn complex human behaviour .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#58:1>
Observation seems to be the only way that animals can learn through .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#59:1>
So , this prove that observation is an effective way of learning .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#60:1>
In human learning , observation also plays an important role ,
especially for children  ' s learning .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#61:1>
Children like to pay attention and imitate the behaviours of other ,
adult is the model that they to imitate .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#62:1>
If you want to know the power of observational learning , the
influence of television exerted on children will be a good answer .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#63:1>
Children are especially impressionable and easily accept ideas from
outsides .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#64:1>
So , it is no wonder that they often pick up the responses from
viewing models on television .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#65:1>
Most people believe that there is a link between television violence
and the growth in aggressive behaviour of children . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#66:1>
<p> When compared with the first two types of learning , classical
conditioning and operant conditioning , observational learning seems to playa
more important role than the other two types .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#67:1>
The typical kind of responses in observational learning is voluntary
responses while that in classical conditioning is involuntary , reflex
responses .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#68:1>
Moreover , the observer  ' s tendency to emit the response may be
strengthened or weakened , depending on the consequences observed .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#69:1>
On the other hand , although the typical kinds of responses in
operant conditioning is also voluntary , it is usually governed by the
somatic nervous system . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#70:1>
<p> From the opinion of Albert Bandura , observational learning is not
entirely separate from classical and operant conditioning .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#71:1>
In fact , observational learning extends the reach of these two types
of conditioning processes greatly and both of them can take place vicariously
through observational learning .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#72:1>
Therefore , a conclusion can be drawn that observational learning
plays a more important role among these three types of learning . </p>

<h> <bold> <it> There is really no need to separate the study of
organizational buyer behavior from consumer buyer behavior . </it> </bold>
</h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#79:2>
<p> Actually , it is necessary to separate the study of organizational buyer
behavior from consumer buyer behavior .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#80:2>
The same consumer buyer behavior concepts cannot simply be applied to
individuals engaging in purchasing behavior as part of their job in the
organization because the context is different . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#81:2>
<p> Consumer behavior may be defined as the decision process and physical
activity individual engage in when evaluating , acquiring , using or
disposing of goods and services .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#82:2>
While organizational buyer behavior is defined as the decision
process by which organizations establish the need for purchasing products and
services , and identify , evaluate , and choose among alternative brands or
suppliers .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#83:2>
There are some similarities between consumer and organizational
behavior as it is not an &ldquo; organization &rdquo; making the buying
decision but the people within the organization .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#84:2>
Both of them make purchase decision in order to satisfy their goals ,
but the goals are completely different <it> by purpose </it> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#85:2>
Organizations have the goals of producing goods and services or
reselling an item , so they buy products and services that allow them to
efficiently engage in these activities .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#86:2>
Consumers purchased for the purpose of individual or household
consumption . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#87:2>
<p> Besides different by purchasing goals , consumer and organizational
buying behavior are also different in several aspects , say <it> marketing
structure and demand , buyer characteristics , and decision processes and
buying pattern </it> . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#88:2>
<p> The market structure and demand for the organizational buyer are
different from that of consumer one by <it> &obrack; 1 &cbrack; geographical
concentration , &obrack; 2 &cbrack; size of buyers , &obrack; 3 &cbrack;
derivation of demand , &obrack; 4 &cbrack; elasticity of demand &obrack; 5
&cbrack; fluctuation of demand and &obrack; 6 &cbrack; format of the market
</it> . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#89:2>
<p> Firstly , organizational buyers are geographically more concentrated than
consumer markets .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#90:2>
There is a tendency for a specific industry to locate in a particular
area due to the comparative advantage gained from concentration .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#91:2>
For example , if most of the garment industries are located in the
west part of the country , then the owner of a new garment factory would
probably like to set up its plant in the west part because of the comparative
advantages , like more materials suppliers , more skilled labour etc. . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#92:2>
<p> Secondly , organizational buyers are also concentrated by size in the
market .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#93:2>
There may be only a few &ldquo; customers &rdquo; in the
organizational market , but the size of the &ldquo; customers &rdquo; is very
large .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#94:2>
The consumption of these &ldquo; customers &rdquo; may be larger than
the consumption of the whole individual buyers . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#95:2>
<p> Thirdly , organizational demand is derived from consumer demand .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#96:2>
For example , General Motor has demand for machinery and parts to
produce cars that are more economic and use less petroleum because of the
demand consumer have for cars that can save them more money .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#97:2>
While consumer demand is derived from their own needs and desires .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#98:2>
<p> Fourthly , the total industry demand for industrial goods is relatively
unaffected by change in price in short run , compared to the price influence
on demand in the consumer markets .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#99:2>
For example , if all Photostat producers raise the price of each of
their machines by &dollar;1000 to the publishers , this would too little or
no effect on demand .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#100:2>
The publishers would still purchase roughly the same amount because
these &dollar;1000 only represent such a small amount in the overall
production cost of books .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#101:2>
But , on the other hand , this &dollar;1000 increase in price in
Photostat would cause a significantly decreased in consumer demand .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#102:2>
Consumers will then shift from a high-priced seller to a lower one .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#103:2>
<p> Fifthly , the fluctuation of demand in organizational market is much
greater than that of consumer markets .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#104:2>
When demand for consumer goods is up , and industrial goods are also
up , organizational buyers will build up the inventories of raw materials .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#105:2>
So when consumer demand is low , organizational will use up the
inventories and postpone the supplies .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#106:2>
Since there are only a few of buyers in organizational market and
the demand from each buyer is very large , decrease in the demand from even
only one buyer will lead to a large fluctuation in total demand .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#107:2>
In consumer market , the fluctuation of demand is very small .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#108:2>
The decrease in demand from hundreds of thousands of consumers would
only cause a very little decrease in the total demand as there is a lot of
consumers in the market . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#109:2>
<p> Finally , organizational markets may be either vertical or horizontal .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#110:2>
In a vertical market , the products or services would be sold to
virtually all organizations in perhaps one or two industries .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#111:2>
While in horizontal market are those which are very board , in which
the products or services are sold to a wide spectrum of industries .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#112:2>
There are no such markets in consumer markets . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#113:2>
<p> Another aspect that differentiates consumer buyer from organizational
buyer behavior is the buyer characteristics .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#114:2>
For organizational buying , a group of individual may be involved in
the buying-decision making process because the products purchased are very
complex and costly .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#115:2>
If a company is going to purchase a package of large machinery ,
people from engineering , production department , finance and purchasing may
involve in the decision making process .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#116:2>
Each of them exerts influence on the final decision .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#117:2>
But , for consumer buying , individuals make purchase decision with
no or little influence from others .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#118:2>
Moreover , in organizational buying , professional buyers need to
have knowledge about the product being bought and , sometimes , technically
competent individual such as engineers are involved in making decision .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#119:2>
There is no need to involved professionals or technically competent
individuals in consumer buying process even consumer are going to buy
high-tech equipment , like hi-fi set .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#120:2>
It is because the information from salespeople or booklet is rich
enough for consumer reference . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#121:2>
<p> Organizational buyers are often strongly directed by <it> rational
motivations </it> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#122:2>
They often give weights to different vendors according to some
criteria like product quality and consistency , prompt delivery assurance ,
price , credit terms , warranty and service .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#123:2>
The one that is higher in weights will be mostly to be chosen .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#124:2>
Buyers are not only directed by rational motivation but also <it>
emotional motivation </it> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#125:2>
They may have likes and dislike for vendor salespeople .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#126:2>
This will also affect their buying behavior .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#127:2>
Just like organizational buyers , consumer buyers are also directed
by rational and emotional motivations but in different extend .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#128:2>
Emotional motivation is much more influential than rational for
consumer buyers .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#129:2>
If the buyer does not like a particular salesperson or vendor , he
will probably not shop at that shop .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#130:2>
But , for organizational buyers , They have more interest in what
salespeople have to sell and less interest in their personality . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#131:2>
<p> The final aspect is the decision process and buying patterns .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#132:2>
Much organizational buyer behavior is typified by greater formality
than consumer one .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#133:2>
There are a lot of procedures and policies that must be followed by
the organizational buyers .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#134:2>
Proposals or contracts are involved in the buying process .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#135:2>
Although consumer may sometimes obtain written price or product
quotes , this is rare , in contrast to the normally precise and formal
processes used among organizational buyers .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#136:2>
Moreover , since the products that organizational buyer going to buy
are complex and costly , decision making process become much complicated and
extensive negotiations are required .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#137:2>
Also , the organizational buyers look for many suppliers to avoid
unforeseen risk and ensure the supply of goods because of the large order
they placed .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#138:2>
They purchase directly and infrequently from the suppliers .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#139:2>
The situation for consumer buyers is different .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#140:2>
Consumer buyers would like to buy goods from a single source because
they expect that they can obtain free goods or discount by purchasing certain
amount of goods at the same time .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#141:2>
Also , they do not need to worry about the supply of goods as the
order they placed is very small compared with the organizational buyers .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#142:2>
Little negotiation is taken placed for consumer buying . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#143:2>
<p> During the decision making process , both the organizational and consumer
buyers are influenced by different factors .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#144:2>
For organizational buyer , there are four categories of influences
<it> :

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#145:2>
&obrack; 1 &cbrack; Environmental &swungdash; physical ,
technological , economic , political , legal , ethical , cultural &semi;

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#146:2>
&obrack; 2 &cbrack; Organizational &swungdash; tasks , structure ,
technology , people &semi;

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#147:2>
&obrack; 3 &cbrack; Interpersonal &swungdash; the buying center ,
buying center roles , power relationships &semi;

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#148:2>
&obrack; 4 &cbrack; Individual &swungdash; motivation , perception ,
learning . </it>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#149:2>
While for consumer buyers , there are two main factors : <it>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#150:2>
&obrack; 1 &cbrack; External &swungdash; cultural , sub-cultural ,
social class and group , family , personality &semi;

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#151:2>
&obrack; 2 &cbrack; Individual &swungdash; information process ,
learning and memory , personality and self-concept , attitude , motivation
and involvement . </it>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#152:2>
We can see that the environment for organizational buyers is more
complicated . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#153:2>
<p> Also , when we examine the decision making process of both buyers , we
can find that the process made by organizational buyers is more complex than
consumer buyers .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#154:2>
The process involved for organizational buyer  ' s are in the
following sequence : <it> problem recognition , needs description , product
specification , vendor search , proposal request , vendor selection ,
purchase routine selection and post purchase evaluation </it> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#155:2>
For consumer buyers , the sequence is <it> : problem recognition ,
information recognition and evaluation , purchase processes and post purchase
behavior . </it> </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#156:2>
<p> We can see that the overall behavior of organizational buyers is more
complex than consumer buyers .

<ICE-HK:W1A-004#157:2>
Therefore , it needs to separate the study of these two buyer  ' s
behavior . </p> </I>
