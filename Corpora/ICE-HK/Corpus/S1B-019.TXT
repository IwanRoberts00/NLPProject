<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-019#1:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#2:1:A>
Now I would like to have your notebook <,> with you because I  ' m
going to discuss something which you have nothing to refer to

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#3:1:A>
You have to depend on listening

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#4:1:A>
We are going to do a bit of discussion today <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#5:1:A>
Yes please hurry up you should have your English notebook somewhere

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#6:1:A>
I  ' ve told you to have one ready <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#7:1:A>
Yes have you got your notebook

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#X8:1:Z>
<unc> a few words </unc> Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-019#9:1:A>
Notebook please <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#10:1:A>
Yes

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#X11:1:Z>
My English book is at home </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-019#12:1:A>
What is it

<$Z3> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#X13:1:Z>
Uh we have done their uh diary in the </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-019#14:1:A>
You shouldn't do that

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#15:1:A>
I asked the class to have a book for English notes isn't it

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#16:1:A>
Dairy is another thing altogether

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#17:1:A>
Diary is a journal something you write at home

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#18:1:A>
You  ' ve <.> han </.> handed it

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#19:1:A>
Or use a piece of paper now

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#20:1:A>
And when you get your diary back <,> you should <,> start a new a
book <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#21:1:A>
Now what I  ' m going to do actually is to ask you <,> uh to ask you  ' re
opinion about

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#22:1:A>
Yes what is it Sabrina

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#23:1:A>
Nothing

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#24:1:A>
I  ' m going to ask your opinion about uh one point

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#25:1:A>
So far we have been using a textbook is that right

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#26:1:A>
And then uh that textbook has all the format for the examination

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#27:1:A>
But then uhm this is non-literary

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#28:1:A>
I wonder if you know what is Lit literature

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#29:1:A>
You know what is literature

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#30:1:A>
And literature is <,> grouped to the two types

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#31:1:A>
One with a capital L and one with the small letter l

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#32:1:A>
I wonder if you remember when I <,> did I teach you for Literature
in form three <O> several replies </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-019#33:1:A>
Some of you yes some of no

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#34:1:A>
Uh those that I did with you in form three I explained about what
literature is

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#35:1:A>
Literature capital letter is a subject to which you study the
writings and styles of the writers

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#36:1:A>
And small letter refers to anything which is printed

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#37:1:A>
So this that I  ' m holding here is a piece of literature because
there are words there you read from it

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#38:1:A>
This is literature

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#39:1:A>
Small letter

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#40:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#41:1:A>
But then with a capital letter it refers to a subject <,> in which
you study the styles and the ways the words are used

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#42:1:A>
What I would like you to uhm do is to think for a short moment <,>
what <,> is according to you what is the uh literary value

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#43:1:A>
All right you know what I mean by <.> litera </.> literary value

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#44:1:A>
Do you think uhm that literature all right uh writings done by
great writers like Shakespeare uhm Charles Dickens should be included in your
English lessons

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#45:1:A>
Because so far all you  ' ve been doing would be about uh uhm general
topics uh WHO and then <.> trans </.> uh communication transportation ghosts
and so on

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#46:1:A>
They are just written by the writer the author of the textbook

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#47:1:A>
But I  ' m asking you now <&> coughing </&> but I  ' m asking you now
is do you think that if you have poems as your English lesson what do you
think <O> several replies </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-019#48:1:A>
Well I would like you to think about

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#49:1:A>
Don't think no or yes

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#50:1:A>
Think about it first

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#51:1:A>
Uhm <O> several replies </O>

<$Z4> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#X52:1:Z>
<unc> a few words </unc> both sides are </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-019#53:1:A>
Think about it

<$Z5> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#X54:1:Z>
Like stories <,,> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-019#55:1:A>
All right have you finished

<$Z6> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#X56:1:Z>
No </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-019#57:1:A>
Now after you have thought it here are a few questions I want
you to answer

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#58:1:A>
You may jot down your answers in your uh book in your notebook

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#59:1:A>
Let  ' s take a word like fire

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#60:1:A>
What is fire

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#61:1:A>
Write it down

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#62:1:A>
What is fire <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#63:1:A>
Now <.> tr </.> try to write <,> to write a sentence in which you
have the word fire <,> used

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#64:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#65:1:A>
So what is fire

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#66:1:A>
You have to give an example and use this fire as one of the words
in your group of words

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#67:1:A>
Understand me

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#68:1:A>
I repeat

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#69:1:A>
Here  ' s my question

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#70:1:A>
What is fire

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#71:1:A>
Got it

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#72:1:A>
Now the next thing you are going going to do is to take this word
fire and write a sentence or a group of words with the word fire in it

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#73:1:A>
Do so now <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#74:1:A>
Just answer this question

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#75:1:A>
Simple

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#76:1:A>
What is fire

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#77:1:A>
So answer this question if you don't know what I want you to do
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#78:1:A>
Your next question is what is ice <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#79:1:A>
Again <,> give an example of how you will use this word in a
sentence

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#80:1:A>
Okay <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#81:1:A>
Just make up any sentence <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#82:1:A>
Have you finished <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#83:1:A>
Okay let  ' s have one of you to read me your first sentence

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#84:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#86:1:A>
What is ice

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#87:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#X89:1:Z>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-019#90:1:A>
Yes fire is the flame with yellow in colour

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#91:1:A>
How will you correct this

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#92:1:A>
I think there is a slight mistake there

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#93:1:A>
How will you correct your sentence

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#94:1:A>
She said fire is a flame with yellow in colour

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#95:1:A>
Can you improve that <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#96:1:A>
Fire is

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#X97:1:Z>
Fire is a flame with yellow and red </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-019#98:1:A>
Well she said fire is a flame with yellow and black

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#99:1:A>
How about yours

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#100:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#101:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#102:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#104:1:A>
Well here uhm that  ' s Bernice uh her answer is that we can burn
something with fire <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#105:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#106:1:A>
Yours from Francis she said uh there  ' s fire come quickly <.> h
</.> help

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#107:1:A>
Uhm that is interesting and then the other one for ice

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#108:1:A>
Let  ' s see what you have for ice

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#109:1:A>
What is ice

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#110:1:A>
Would you put some ice <,> into the Coke please

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#111:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#112:1:A>
And you have not finished

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#113:1:A>
Have you finished

<$Z9> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#X114:1:Z>
I haven't finished </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-019#115:1:A>
You haven't finished okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#116:1:A>
And how about yours

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#117:1:A>
What have you written for <,> ice

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#118:1:A>
Ice is something that will melt

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#119:1:A>
No s

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#120:1:A>
Melt in high temperature

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#121:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#122:1:A>
And Germane yours is <,> ice is the solid form of water

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#123:1:A>
This is very scientific

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#124:1:A>
Okay so this is the different answers you give

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#125:1:A>
Now we call all these except one case which I won't call it uh
non-literary

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#126:1:A>
I think she has a very

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#127:1:A>
Who has that

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#128:1:A>
Hell

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#129:1:A>
Yes I think her use of fire is dramatic

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#130:1:A>
Now she said ice is solid form of water

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#131:1:A>
And she said fire uhm there  ' s fire in hell right

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#132:1:A>
Now these two are different ways of writing

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#133:1:A>
Taking the first one I would that dramatic

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#134:1:A>
Taking the other one I would call that scientific <,> or a
statement

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#135:1:A>
Do you know what I  ' m trying to show you

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#136:1:A>
Right

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#137:1:A>
Then let  ' s go to another question

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#138:1:A>
What is a young man

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#139:1:A>
What is a young man

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#140:1:A>
Now we are thinking of the <,> non-literary

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#141:1:A>
We are not trying to make it dramatic all right

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#142:1:A>
So don't think of anything dramatic yet

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#143:1:A>
Just think of uhm an ordinary answer or an on <.> a </.> an
ordinary use of the words young man <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#144:1:A>
What have you written about the young man <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#145:1:A>
Now remember your sentence should have the word young man there

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#146:1:A>
Young man <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#147:1:A>
What have you got Fiona

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#148:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#153:1:A>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-019#156:1:A>
And and likes more outdoor activities

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#157:1:A>
Fine that  ' s very good

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#158:1:A>
I think you all know the use of uhm <,> of the words

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#159:1:A>
Now the next one the the fourth question is what is a young woman

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#160:1:A>
You  ' ve got the sentence for young man now would you please give
an example of <,> a sentence with young woman <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#161:1:A>
Okay yes Rebecca have you got your sentence written <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#166:1:A>
Right <,> you should have finished by now

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#167:1:A>
Candy what is your sentence about young woman

<$Z12> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#X168:1:Z>
<[> No </[> </{> </X>

<$Z13> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#X169:1:Z>
A young woman is walking down on the street who is very beautiful
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-019#170:1:A>
A young woman <,> comma walking down the street is very
beautiful

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#171:1:A>
I  ' ve <.> co </.> I  ' ve corrected her sentence already

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#172:1:A>
And how about yours uh <,> what is it

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#173:1:A>
Will you read it out

<$Z14> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#X174:1:Z>
A young woman  ' s age is around fifteen to twenty five years old

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#X175:1:Z>
And she is very beautiful </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-019#176:1:A>
So young woman in your opinion <,> a young woman is or young
women plural are always beautiful

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#177:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#178:1:A>
We all are <&> students ' laughter

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#179:1:A>
Now look at look at your sentences

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#180:1:A>
Look at the sentences you  ' ve made

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#181:1:A>
What do you feel about it

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#182:1:A>
Do you think that it is a statement a definition <,> or giving
information

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#183:1:A>
Look at your own because each of you <,> each one of you have a
different form uh I mean different sentence

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#184:1:A>
So what kind of sentence have you written Sabrina Chan

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#185:1:A>
Yours is a <,> definition

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#186:1:A>
Could you read out your sentence

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#187:1:A>
Read it aloud

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#188:1:A>
Yes your well have the fire one

<$Z15> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#X189:1:Z>
Fire is a flame <unc> one word </unc> in red in colour
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-019#190:1:A>
Yes so what you call that a <,> definition

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#191:1:A>
Is it a definition <O> Unidentified speech </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-019#192:1:A>
I think it is more of an information

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#193:1:A>
Because if you define fire I don't think you define it that way

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#194:1:A>
You have to look up your <.> Sci </.> <&> coughing </&> excuse me
your Science <,> in Form one or Form two isn't it when fire is explained
something that produce heat

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#195:1:A>
Is that right

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#196:1:A>
Fire produces heat that would be <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#197:1:A>
Information isn't it

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#198:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#199:1:A>
Now think of <,> where would we usually use words with definition

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#200:1:A>
If you are giving a definition where will you find them

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#254:1:A>
Have you <.> hea </.> have you seen this film

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#255:1:A>
Okay now <,> this is what we call the literary use of language

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#256:1:A>
We are using the words but we are making it <,> I mean we are
using it in the uh in a way that has a style of its own

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#257:1:A>
So the first one could you write this down <,> so that you can
look at it again

Let  ' s give her a hand <O> Applause </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-019#300:1:A>
Well done

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#301:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#302:1:A>
Right now my purpose in doing this is to make you or ask you to
compare the two

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#303:1:A>
Now in the first section here we I  ' ve mentioned about fire I  ' ve
mentioned ice

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#304:1:A>
And now I  ' ve gone on to <,> same topic ice and fire mentioned

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#305:1:A>
And then we have young man but this time instead of young man
which word have I used

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#306:1:A>
I mean which word is being used

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#307:1:A>
Instead of young man which is the other word

<$Z21> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#X308:1:Z>
Youth </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-019#309:1:A>
And instead of young woman which word <O> Several replies
</O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-019#310:1:A>
Maid

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#311:1:A>
So now we have two groups of words

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#312:1:A>
Ice fire

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#313:1:A>
Maid and youth

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#314:1:A>
Young man young woman

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#315:1:A>
Question number one now what is the difference between a maid and
a youth <,> to the author <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#316:1:A>
What is the difference between a maid and a youth to the author
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#317:1:A>
Now try to answer it

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#318:1:A>
What do you think is the difference <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#319:1:A>
Uh perhaps you leave two lines

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#320:1:A>
I  ' ll give you a a number of questions because we may not have
enough time to finish it off

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#321:1:A>
But anyway I  ' ll give you all those questions and we  ' ll discuss
it

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#322:1:A>
Uh next question

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#323:1:A>
Leave one or two lines will be enough

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#324:1:A>
Do you agree with the author  ' s definitions

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#325:1:A>
Now you find that the author of those four lines is saying
something about what is a youth and what is a maid

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#326:1:A>
Do you agree <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#327:1:A>
What is the answer to what is a youth according to the author <O>
Several replies </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-019#328:1:A>
It is <,> impetuous fire

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#329:1:A>
And the answer to what is a maid <,> <{> <[> ice and desire <&>
overlaps with several replies </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#330:1:A>
That  ' s right

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#331:1:A>
So try to think of that

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#332:1:A>
And from the four lines your next question please

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#333:1:A>
It  ' s number three isn't it

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#334:1:A>
Now for your next one

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#335:1:A>
According to those four lines what can you tell about the author
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#336:1:A>
And try to guess whether whether the author is a young person

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#337:1:A>
An adult

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#338:1:A>
Is the person a male or female

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#339:1:A>
And why do you think that person is young

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#340:1:A>
Or why do you think that person is old

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#341:1:A>
You have to base your answer on those four lines there

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#342:1:A>
Give yourself about three or four lines and then go on to the next
because I would like you to work on it at home

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#343:1:A>
And we  ' ll continue discussing it next time okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#344:1:A>
And <,,> for the four lines <,> uhm <,> where would you find them
or I should say what kind of books will you find them

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#345:1:A>
You understand me

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#346:1:A>
Just then in the earlier section I asked you where would you find
those words those answers you gave

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#347:1:A>
And you mentioned from <,> the dictionary from Science textbook
and perhaps from story books

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#348:1:A>
And how about these four lines where do you think you will find
them <,,> <&> Bell rings </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#349:1:A>
And leave yourself two lines

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#350:1:A>
The next one is number five

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#351:1:A>
What is the purpose of those four lines <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#352:1:A>
And I  ' ll give you those uh examples

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#353:1:A>
For examples is it uh to define

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#354:1:A>
Does it tell us feelings and attitudes

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#355:1:A>
Define

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#356:1:A>
To define question mark

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#357:1:A>
To express feelings and attitudes question mark

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#358:1:A>
Or to <,> arouse your imagination

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#359:1:A>
A R O U S E

<ICE-HK:S1B-019#360:1:A>
To arouse your imagination </I>
