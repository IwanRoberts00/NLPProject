<ICE-HK:W1A-018#1:1>
a &cbrack; Viscoamylography </h>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#2:1>
It is used to measure the relatively viscosity of a system heated
at constant rate &obrack; 1.5&degree;C/min &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#3:1>
So it is frequently employed to study the gelatinizing property of
starch . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#4:1>
When starch granules are added into cold water , water molecules
can freely penetrate into the starch granule .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#5:1>
The water absorption and the volume change of starch granule are
reversible and the starch granule only swell slight .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#6:1>
Heating the system <del> <unc> 2-characters </unc> </del> to
just below the <del> g </del> starch gelatinization temperature does not
bring any significant change .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#7:1>
But if the heating temperature is increased beyond the starch
gelatinization temperature , irreversible changes occur .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#8:1>
This can be reflected in the viscoamylograph . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#9:1>
After passing the gelatinization temperature of starch , the
viscosity increases .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#10:1>
This is the result of <del> <unc> 1-character </unc> </del>
starch continual <del> up </del> taking up water and swelling substantially .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#11:1>
As the temperature increases , the starch granule becomes <del>
<unc> 3-characters </unc> </del> distorted and releases the soluble
starch &obrack; amylose &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#12:1>
The soluble starch together with the continual uptake of water by the
<del> <.> reman </.> </del> remnants of starch granules cause an additional
large increase in the viscosity of the system .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#13:1>
The starch granule will continue to <-> solublize </-> <+> solubilize
</+> as the temperature increases until the whole granular structure <del>
<?> <.> de </.> </?> </del> dissolves .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#14:1>
This would require a temperature of l20&degree;C .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#15:1>
However , in food system , the temperature cannot exceed l00&degree;C
otherwise the system will boil .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#16:1>
Therefore the amylograph is discontinued at 95&degree;C .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#17:1>
The swollen starch granules are then held for 1 hr at 95&degree;C .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#18:1>
Holding the starch at a specific temperature doesn't increase its
solubility . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#19:1>
A marked decrease in the viscosity of the system is observed at
the start of the <del> <unc> 2-characters </unc> </del> holding <->
peroid </-> <+> period </+> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#20:1>
This is due to the soluble starch fractions orientating themselves in
the direction that is the same as the stirring direction .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#21:1>
This is called shear thinning.The system is then cooled by using a
controlled cooling &obrack; 1.5&degree;C/min &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#22:1>
And during this <-> peroid </-> <+> period </+> , the viscosity rises
again .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#23:1>
This is called set back .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#24:1>
The phenomenon is due to the decrease in energy of the system <del>
that </del> which then allows more hydrogen bonding , resulting in increased
viscosity . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#25:1>
&obrack; c &cbrack; Cross-linking of starch </h>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#26:1>
It is a method used to modify the functional properties of native
starch .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#27:1>
Cross-linking is the covalent bonding of two starch molecules to make
a larger molecule .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#28:1>
It can be achieved by forming a diester with phosphoric acid or
forming <del> a </del> diether bonds with epichlorohydrin . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#29:1>
High levels cross-linked starch has an increased gelatinization
temperature so that the modified starch <del> m </del> is not dissolved in
autoclave or boiling system .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#30:1>
This type of starch finds its application in surgical gloves which
have to be sterilized at high temperature and if <del> a </del> it is
accidently remained in patient body , it will be digested . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#31:1>
Low levels cross-linked starch does not have sign change in the
gelatinization temperature , but it shows significant chance in pasting
property .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#32:1>
Upon gelatinization the starch granule swells less and is less
soluble .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#33:1>
Therefore it has a pasting viscosity lower than the parent starch .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#34:1>
One advantage of this modified starch is that it is not susceptible
to shearing thinning .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#35:1>
<del> since </del> This is because the starch granule <-> solublizes
</-> <+> solubilizes </+> less , it shears less .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#36:1>
Therefore it can still maintain a high viscosity after pumping and
stirring .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#37:1>
</p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#38:1>
Low levels cross-linked starch is useful to produce a <del> thick
</del> viscous system in acid medium e.g. thickening of cherry pie filling .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#39:1>
The acidity of cherry can hydrolyse &alpha;1-4 glucosidic linkages of
starch molecules and thus results in thinning of pie filling .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#40:1>
But if the starch granule has sufficient cross-linking , the problem
can be solved .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#41:1>
This starch granule has restricted swelling upon gelatinization , and
as the acid hydrolyses the bonds , the viscosity increases instead of
decreasing . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#42:1>
Cross-linked starch can also be used to control retrogradation .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#43:1>
As retrogradation usually exhibits in starch fragments that are small
and more mobile .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#44:1>
This prevents watering and opaqueness of gel . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#45:1>
It can also be used to maintain gel consistence when the gel is
frozen and thawed .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#46:1>
This is done by holding the starch chains fixed in space so that upon
thawing , they can interact with each other to retrograde .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#47:1>
Water can again hydrate the starch chains . </p> <h>

<-> Cron </-> <+> Corn </+> grain is mainly used in wet milling
industry and corn distiller process for beverage production . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#50:1>
In wet milling industry , the primary products are starch and
nutritive sweetener .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#51:1>
About 65-70&percent; of total corn used in wet milling can be
converted to primary products .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#52:1>
The remainings are by-products which are further processed to animal
feed .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#53:1>
In the wet milling process , many by-products <del> <unc>
3-characters </unc> </del> are produced , for example steep liquor from
the steeping stage; corn germ meal from the germ which has its oil extracted
and the bran .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#54:1>
Mixing of the above by-products in composition can produce the corn
gluten feed which is a palatable animal feed .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#55:1>
The gluten separated from the starch can also be sold as corn gluten
meal which is also an animal feed .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#56:1>
Even the corn oil is a valuable by product .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#57:1>
The <del> starch </del> corn starch produced from the wet milling
<del> can be <.> us </.> </del> is mainly used for nutritive sweetener
production and for papermaking . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#58:1>
About 90&percent; of starch used in papermaking comes from corn .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#59:1>
The use of corn starch can improve the properties of the paper and
reduce the production cost .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#60:1>
However , modification of the starch is <del> <unc> 2-characters
</unc> </del> usually need before it can be an additive for paper making .
</p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#61:1>
The biggest corn starch user is the sweetener production industry .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#62:1>
Corn starch can be used for making sweeteners such as anhydrose
dextrose , high <del> <unc> 1-character </unc> </del> fructose corn
syrup .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#63:1>
The latter is more important since it has a sweetness approach to
that of sucrose and so it is frequently used to substitute sucrose in food .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#64:1>
This is because sucrose is more expensive .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#65:1>
Dextrose has been widely used in beverage , <-> confectionary </->
<+> confectionery </+> , <del> <.> bark </.> </del> baking industries while
HFCS is widely used in soft drinks and baking industries . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#66:1>
The production of sweeteners is enzymatic fermentation <del>
<unc> 1-character </unc> </del> process in which &alpha;-amylase and
glucoamylase are used .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#67:1>
The former <del> <.> convel </.> </del> converts the starch to small
saccharides and the latter act on the saccharides to produce dextrose .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#68:1>
42&percent; HFCS is produced by partial isomerisation of the purified
dextrose to fructose with immobilized <del> <?> <.> gluco </.> </?> </del>
glucose <del> <.> am </.> </del> isomerase .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#69:1>
The use of chromatographic separation techniques <del> to </del>
produce a 90&percent; fructose products which can then be blended with <del>
<unc> 2-characters </unc> </del> 42&percent; HFCS to form 55&percent;
HFCS . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#70:1>
Corn can also be used for beverage production and again <del> <?>
valuable </?> </del> by products such as dried distiller  ' s grains , dried
distiller  ' s grains with solubles , dried distiller  ' s solubles are widely
used as animal feed . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#71:1>
The high <-> avaibility </-> <+> availability </+> , abundance
and low cost have make corn to be attractive commodity .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#72:1>
From the above it can be seen that corn can be turned to many <->
vauable </-> <+> valuable </+> products through the wet milling process .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#73:1>
In China , domestically produced maize is mostly used directly as
food or as animal feeds &obrack; This is <del> with </del> an uneconomical
use of corn . &cbrack; In order to increase the value of domestic maize
production , the Government of China should establish some more wet milling
plants and buy the corn crop from the farmer .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#74:1>
In this way the government can change the low value corn grain to
many more useful and high value products <del> <unc> 1-character
</unc> </del> and byproducts .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#75:1>
Nowadays there is a great demand for corn starch for manufacturing of
nutritive sweeteners , also corn oil &obrack; by products of wet corn milling
&cbrack; is being recognised to be <-> benefical </-> <+> beneficial </+> to
health and more and more people use it .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#76:1>
There will be great profit if wet milling industry is developed in
China . </p> <h>

Wheat protein is the essential <-> ingredent </-> <+> ingredient
</+> in wheat flour which is the only one cereal flour that can be used for
breadmaking .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#79:1>
What make wheat flour unique is the present of storage proteins
called gluten .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#80:1>
Gluten has important functional properties in bread . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#81:1>
Bread is a yeast leavened products and it must contains at least
4 <del> <.> mimim mimi </.> </del> minimum ingredients: flour &obrack; wheat
&cbrack; , salt , yeast , water .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#82:1>
The production of bread is a fermentation process .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#83:1>
A dough that <del> can </del> is able to <del> <unc> 3-characters
</unc> </del> retain gas and rise is necessary for breadmaking .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#84:1>
The first contribution made by wheat gluten is the participation in
the dough structure .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#85:1>
It forms the major structural <del> components </del> component by
providing a matrix for the strings of starch granules .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#86:1>
It also affects the rheological property of the dough by contributing
to the cohesiveness and elasticity of the dough . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#87:1>
During the fermentation of a developed dough .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#88:1>
The <del> <?> yeat </?> </del> yeast utilize the carbohydrate
substrate to produce alcohol and carbon dioxide .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#89:1>
The latter is responsible for raising the dough .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#90:1>
<del> <unc> 2-words </unc> </del> Therefore the trapping of
carbon dioxide is very important otherwise the dough will not <del> <unc>
1-character </unc> </del> <del> rise </del> rise .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#91:1>
<del> <unc> 1-word </unc> </del> The cohesiveness contributed
by gluten makes the dough able to <-> incoporate </-> <+> incorporate </+>
air into itself .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#92:1>
The presence of these small air cells is important since yeast cannot
produce air cells .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#93:1>
During fermentation CO2 is first produced in the aqueous phase of the
dough .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#94:1>
Once the aqueous phase has been saturated with CO2 , CO2 will diffuse
into the air <del> <unc> 1-word </unc> </del> cells and cause them to
expand .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#95:1>
It is the elastic property offered by gluten <del> <.> wh </.> </del>
that allows the expansion of gas cells .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#96:1>
Also during the baking process the presence of gluten allow the large
expansion of gas cells .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#97:1>
Another characteristic that <del> <unc> 1-character </unc>
</del> gluten contribute to the leavening system is its structure .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#98:1>
The special structure of gluten slows down the diffusion of CO2 and
therefore effectively retaining the gas . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#99:1>
In a dough which is well mixed , gluten is completely hydrated so
that it <del> carry </del> carries considerable amount of water .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#100:1>
During baking , water is needed for gelatinization of starch and at
the same time protein is denatured to release the water molecules that allow
gelatinization of starch possible . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#101:1>
The quality of bread is mainly depend on <del> its </del> the
size and amount of gas cells that present in the bread , and the <-> gluent
</-> <+> gluten </+> has sign contribution to this . </p> </I>

David Hawkes said that one of his translation principle is to
translate everything &dash; even puns .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#103:2>
Actually , in translating , it is impossible to translate everything
as there are cultural differences arise in the source text and the target
text .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#104:2>
Therefore , many unique features of Chinese culture such as those
appeared in <O> Chinese-characters </O> is impossible to be translated into
<del> <.> Ch </.> </del> English . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#105:2>
In fact , David Hawkes adopts a rather free translation method
in translating <O> Chinese-characters </O> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#106:2>
Firstly , he does not translate the book  ' s name <O>
Chinese-characters </O> <del> into </del> into &ldquo; <ul> The Dream of Red
Chamber </ul> &ldquo; that the term <mention> &ldquo; red &rdquo; </mention>
is associated with certain connotative meaning as " <O> Chinese-characters
</O> &rdquo; , that is a cultural barrier that <del> which </del> the
foreigners <del> only </del> by reading the translated version will fail to
understand .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#107:2>
Therefore , he translate the book  ' s name into &ldquo; <ul> The
Story of the Stone </ul> &ldquo; as the whole story of <O> Chinese-characters
</O> is talking about &ldquo; <O> Chinese-characters </O> &rdquo; who is born
from stone .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#108:2>
So the story about &ldquo; <O> Chinese-characters </O> &rdquo; is
actually about &ldquo; The Stone &rdquo; . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#109:2>
Moreover , David Hawkes  ' s translation method , unlike &lsquo;
his principle &rsquo; as said before , is not to translate everything . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#110:2>
It is obvious that in the translated version of &ldquo; The
Story of the Stone &rdquo; the first few paragraphs of the original &ldquo;
<O> Chinese-characters </O> &rdquo; is omitted .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#111:2>
Also , he is selectively translated the poems . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#112:2>
Furthermore , when he translate the parts related to &lsquo;
puns &rsquo; , he cannot keep the Chinese pun in the translation but he <del>
uses </del> makes some changes and translated the &lsquo; puns &rsquo; in
another ways . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#113:2>
Also , when David Hawkes translates the concepts about Taoism ,
he cannot translate <del> the term </del> all the meanings in the terms .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#114:2>
For example , in translating  '  <O> Chinese-characters </O> &rsquo; ,
it is a term used in Taoism , David Hawkes fails <del> fails </del> to
translate <del> the </del> all this concept <del> in </del> to English but
only translate it directly from the lexical meaning due to cultural
differences .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#115:2>
</p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#116:2>
All in all , David Hawkes  ' s principle about to translate
everything and even puns is not <del> valid </del> so correct since it is
impossible to translate everything .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#117:2>
Translation is actually a craft in converting one language into
another .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#118:2>
But there are losses eg .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#119:2>
meanings in the process of translating One hundred percentage
equivalent translation is not possible . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#120:2>
Also , the puns in Chinese may be or may not be <del> <.> kee
</.> </del> kept in translating into English as there are differences in two
languages and cultures . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#121:2>
Therefore , David Hawkes &rsquo; principle is not <del> valid
</del> so correct at all . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#122:2>
PART II 1 </h>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#123:2>
There are many linguistic theories of culture .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#124:2>
It is because due to the cultural differences .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#125:2>
The use of languages by different people of different cultures are
not the same .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#126:2>
Therefore , linguistic theories of culture is useful in analysing
the differences or similarity of different culture .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#127:2>
By using , linguistic , we can analyse the problems in a more
scientific and logical way .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#128:2>
</p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#129:2>
Firstly , from linguistic theories of culture , we can analyse
the way people saying &ldquo; Yes &rdquo; or &ldquo; No &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#130:2>
For example , Japanese is a race <del> <.> wh </.> </del> who tend
to always " Yes &rdquo; all the time .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#131:2>
If we don't know linguistic , we don't know when do they <del> say
</del> mean <mention> &lsquo; agree &rsquo; </mention> or <mention> &lsquo;
disagree &rsquo; </mention> . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#132:2>
Secondly , <del> there are </del> except verbal communication ,
there are non-verbal communication exist such as body gesture .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#133:2>
If we study linguistic we can know the way people express themselves
, <del> <.> si </.> </del> as different races have different ways of body
gestures <del> as </del> for non-verbal communication purposes . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#134:2>
Also , the loudness of <del> <.> vio </.> </del> the voices ,
the times of repeating a statement is a special way of expressing something
in different cultures .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#135:2>
For example , <del> <unc> 4-characters </unc> </del> people
in <del> Phillipines </del> Philippines tend to repeat their statement when
confirming their point of view .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#136:2>
</p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#137:2>
In Hong Kong , people tend to say &lsquo; We  ' ll have tea later
&rsquo; , <del> or </del> &lsquo; Visit you later &rsquo; or &lsquo; Call you
later and so on to <del> represent </del> show the friendly manner , actually
<del> , <.> w </.> </del> people saying it without an intention to bring an
<del> the </del> action .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#138:2>
There is a story <del> arisen because </del> due to of the culture
misunderstanding .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#139:2>
<del> We </del> When a <del> boy </del> boy talked to his friend ,
who is a foreigner about the Chinese food and he arbitrarily said that if
that foreigner came to his home tomorrow , he <del> <.> pr </.> </del> would
prepare a Chinese meal for him .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#140:2>
The boy would not expect the foreigner come to his home , however ,
the next day , the foreigner came to the boy  ' s home and wanted to taste the
Chinese food .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#141:2>
But actually , the boy did not prepare any food at all .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#142:2>
There is the problem about cultural differences . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#143:2>
Moreover , because of the different cultures , the &ldquo;
Westerners &rdquo; and Chinese have a different perception about colour .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#144:2>
For example , in Chinese society , white colour is associated with
the unfortunate thing such as someone die .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#145:2>
But for the foreigners , white colour is associated <-> withe </->
<+> with the </+> celebration such as wedding .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#146:2>
Also , red colour is associated with &lsquo; lucky &rsquo; or
celebration in Chinese culture , but in Western society , red colour is
associated with danger . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-018#147:2>
Therefore , the study of linguistic theories of culture can help
us to analyse the differences of culture in different society and help us to
avoid the misunderstanding arise from it . </p> <h>

Huckleberry Finn has its own style of speech demonstrates his
uniqueness and individualism , which is quite different from <del> the </del>
other people in the book .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#151:2>
His speech does not follow the standard English but &lsquo; create
&rsquo; <del> his own </del> a new way of speech a kind of American <del>
vernacular </del> dialect &obrack; Southwestern vernacular &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#152:2>
He does not follow the  ' standard &rsquo; grammatical rules and it
seems that his speech <del> is full of </del> has errors and not correct .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#153:2>
For example , <del> to </del> in the beginning of the book &obrack;
1st paragraph &cbrack; Huck said that , <quote> " <del> <unc>
2-characters </unc> </del> You don't know about me without you have read

Moreover , Huck  ' s behaviour as considered by many people is
acceptable though he help the slave , Jim to escape from the family but it is
Huck  ' s wise to take every opportunity to escape from civilization , from his
father <del> , the </del> and the family which restricts him , but he is not
just a indulgence person . </p>

Huck is regarded as a bad boy , but he save a slave , Jim from
the Old South &obrack; before the Civil War &cbrack; down the <-> Missippi
</-> <+> Mississippi </+> River seems to be a brave behaviour and considered
&lsquo; good &rsquo; by the people .

<ICE-HK:W1A-018#156:2>
Though he and Jim  ' s life is a way of alienation from the
civilization , it also can be considered escape from the traditional rules
and restriction and so find a way to freedom , to set themselves free . </p>

</del> concerns are quite different .
