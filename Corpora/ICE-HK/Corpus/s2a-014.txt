<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#1:1:A>
Tough to reverse those placings but <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#2:1:A>
he does have reasonable form around here at Happy Valley and with
the stable having a win in the previous probably should be kept a little
safer <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#3:1:A>
perhaps those horses starting to <,> may be those horses ready to
show something <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#4:1:A>
Indy  ' s Gem been a disappointment this season and uh I think he was
handicapped pretty pretty well to sort of pick up a race but uh haven't
really appeared to be too many excuses for him <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#5:1:A>
uh he  ' s a he  ' s a big price twenty to one the market doesn't
suggest that uh a there  ' s much improvement in him and I don't really I
couldn't have him on this season  ' s form I could last though so I really
don't know what to make of him <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#6:1:B>
Yep I would uh fully agree with you there on last season  ' s
form he  ' d have a great chance but he looks as though he  ' s had easy enough
opportunities to me already this season <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#7:1:B>
ah he  ' s getting a bit warm in the paddock here tonight he does lack
a little bit of sparkle he doesn't look like a horse who  ' s really in the
absolute top of form at the moment <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#8:1:B>
his form hasn't appeared to be on this track either so I  ' m quite
happy to stay wide clear of him now <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#9:1:C>
He  ' s been fancied at all three runs this term <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#10:1:C>
Douglas White Shane Dye and Eric Legrix have all had chances to try
and uh get a win out of him <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#11:1:C>
I don't see how uh Wai Leung  ' s going to be able to do that tonight
from barrier ten <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#12:1:C>
couldn't have him at the moment Indy  ' s Gem he  ' s been a big
disappointment <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#13:1:C>
here  ' s Millennium Legend coming back to the sixteen fifty metres
the eighteen hundred metres he failed to stay it out last week behind Jade
Rui <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#14:1:C>
had his try though he had a soft lead <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#15:1:C>
Quick Step gave him about four lengths in the run and beat him a
half on the wire <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#16:1:C>
he  ' s drawn to go forward in gate seven <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#17:1:B>
Yeah ah not as taken by him as I was earlier on in the season
when uh I thought he actually looked very good indeed <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#18:1:B>
ah I just wonder whether that stretching of his stamina last time
is going to leave a mark or not <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#19:1:B>
he certainly doesn't look to be quite as well as he did he  ' s
certainly not losing weight like he was last season but uh he has looked
better than this already this season <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#20:1:A>
He  ' s he  ' s pretty consistent over the Valley mile uh I mean
he  ' s hard to hard to ignore I think he  ' ll be he  ' ll be there or thereabouts
he should get a reasonable run from where he  ' s drawn <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#21:1:A>
doesn't win too often but uh doesn't finish out of the frame too
often either so <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#22:1:A>
hard to hard to leave out Millennium Legend next one along who I
think will take a lot of beating but uh he  ' s probably under the odds in the
betting he  ' s uh slightly better than six to four or twenty six fifty <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#23:1:A>
good record last time where the pace was very strong he he won
first up of course uh with uh Tony Cruz up this season <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#24:1:A>
I just think he  ' s a slightly improved horse this this term and I
think he  ' ll take a lot of beating from a favourable draw <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#25:1:B>
Don't see why he shouldn't ah in actual fact Clint this horse
Country Dragon as you say had a very tough run last time <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#26:1:B>
uh Felix Coetzer wasn't aboard either and uh I think he  ' s uh
likely to get on with him uh all the much better he  ' s the one that  ' s been
uh riding him out in work in the mornings ah he  ' s likely to be putting him
in the right position <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#27:1:B>
he looks pretty well drawn in three even if he doesn't need to get
the soft run into the race and he looks very well <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#28:1:B>
ah I  ' m more than happy the way Country Dragon has come into the
paddock here tonight <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#29:1:C>
He was very impressive when he won first up for Tony Cruz this
season and uh <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#30:1:C>
like you Mark I don't think he necessarily has to lead if he took
the sit behind Millennium Legend or something lese that might want to spear
forward <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#31:1:C>
he  ' d be in an ideal position here tonight he did do much work last
time and really battled on well <,> De Integro <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#32:1:C>
he might get a nice uh soft smother up on the rails enough to
ensure he runs a place uh from gate number one <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#33:1:C>
last time out he finished a close fourth to Millennium Spirit over
the slightly longer journey <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#34:1:B>
Looks in great order I must say De Integro big strong powerful
quarters on him <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#35:1:B>
he can get a bit warm on some occasions he looks pretty settled
here tonight <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#36:1:B>
I  ' m happy very happy the way he  ' s come into the paddock as well
he  ' s drawn very well in one another horse who could get a very good run into
the race <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#37:1:B>
he always carry  ' s a bit of condition on him uhm I like him here
tonight he looks in good good order <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#38:1:A>
He uh certainly does and Peter Chapel Hyam  ' s got him holding
his form very well and <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#39:1:A>
uh as you mentioned already he  ' s going to get a good run and
certainly could make the frame and uh he  ' s a little bit of value so he  ' s
one to uh keep safe <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#40:1:A>
John Egan on board <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#41:1:A>
Next one I think we  ' re going back up to the top half with Cullinan
I just thought he  ' d be a little bit of a risk over the trip uhm I thought
his work and everything had been pretty good leading up to this particular
outing but <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#42:1:A>
the real question mark for me Mark was uh after that last run up in
distance I I had big queries over him about seeing out the trip particularly
from a wide gate <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#43:1:B>
Ah yes I wouldn't disagree with that either <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#44:1:B>
he  ' s a horse who  ' s got his fair amount of temperament too he can
fire up and be very temperamental in the parade ring <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#45:1:B>
it  ' s actually been pretty good for him here tonight ah I  ' ve seen
him an awful lot worse than he  ' s been doing in here <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#46:1:B>
so interesting <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#47:1:B>
Eric Legrix on board of course ah successful from our last whether
he can make it a quick double remains to be seen <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#48:1:B>
the market would suggest otherwise two hundred and seventy dollars
ah I just think he looks well enough in himself but not the race that I think
is ideal for him as it stands <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#49:1:B>
so I  ' m certainly not drawing a negative from the paddock over him
he  ' s actually behaved himself better tonight <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#50:1:C>
Okay showed no interest in the race whatsoever last time all
the head gear comes off him <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#51:1:C>
Just In Time <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#52:1:C>
ah he loomed up as the winner momentarily here at his first go over
the sixteen fifty but Romantic Venture was the horse that really benefited
from the fast pace and came right over the top <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#53:1:C>
but this horse would certainly have to rate a chance on form this
season <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#54:1:B>
Looks in good order too Just In Time looks to be holding his
form far better than he has done in the past <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#55:1:B>
looks to be holding his condition far better than he has done in
the past as well <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#56:1:B>
so there  ' s ah a couple of positives to say the least that ah this
horse Just In Time <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#57:1:B>
Uhm wouldn't be at all surprised to see him go close now

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#58:1:A>
Yip based on that last run would have to be one for the short
list here <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#59:1:A>
but can't really say anything positive about Seattle Sun ah his
form this season has been pretty woeful really <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#60:1:A>
this was his has been it was his track last season certainly he
notched a couple of wins here over the Valley mile and <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#61:1:A>
he  ' s capable on his day but not based on what we  ' ve seen this
year Mark <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#62:1:B>
I tell you one thing Clint this horse hasn't looked like this
all season this is uh a a massive turnaround in what he  ' s looked like in in
the paddock <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#63:1:B>
he  ' s continued to sweat and not look well in himself I think he
actually looks a million dollars here tonight ah and this one has caught me
out big time ah <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#64:1:B>
the last time he did this he actually ran a big race <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#65:1:B>
I would now want to keep him safe he  ' s going out at huge odds but
I think this is the best I  ' ve seen him look in a long long while Seattle Sun
<,>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#66:1:C>
Okay this is his first run in almost four weeks Seattle Sun so
the works been poured into him <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#67:1:C>
on his best form he would rate so uh perhaps he worth a
reassessment <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#68:1:C>
the way the results have been going here tonight <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#69:1:B>
Ha ha ha

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#70:1:C>
Look for those with the bad form and you  ' re half way there
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#71:1:C>
Golden King in the Gold Flask colours wonder if they will rub off a
bit <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#72:1:C>
he lead up in the Land Lord trial and ran third <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#73:1:B>
Ha ha ha

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#74:1:C>
Clearly beaten in both race starts this season <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#75:1:B>
That infamous trial Darren <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#76:1:C>
Yeah yes let  ' s just call it that trial <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#77:1:B>
Seattle Sun is actually getting very wound up now as he makes
his way out on the course <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#78:1:B>
just starting to ah get a little bit of a sweat on but he looks
like a horse who  ' s on the job here tonight <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#79:1:B>
ah not overly taken by Golden King certainly doesn't seem to have
an adverse effect with the blinkers on though he  ' s not been fired up at all
uhm but he fails to take my eye I still think he looks like a bit of a green
baby to me and I think he  ' s going to need a bit of time

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#80:1:A>
Yip looks the way the next one  ' s an interesting runner Profit
Treasure has the blinkers applied ah tonight for the first time I believe and
ah his last run was actually quite encouraging Mark uhm definitely one that I  ' d
be keeping safe he  ' s ah around ah nine to point or one hundred and six fifty
in the betting what did you make of him <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#81:1:B>
Ah I thought he looked still to be a bit on the light side I I
just think he may have flattered last time Me And You was the horse that won
that race I don't think it was a particularly strong contest <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#82:1:B>
he looks very well in himself but there  ' s not a great deal of him
uh for me I still think he needs to strengthen up a fraction yet <,> quarters
look good though so it  ' s just he  ' s lacking a bit of depth behind the saddle
ah I  ' d say he  ' s not far off from being absolutely right <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#83:1:C>
I wonder if they  ' ll go forward again on this ah Glory St
Pauls he just keeps knocking up <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#84:1:B>
Is there any choice ah I think is the question because he does
look to pull very keenly indeed Simon Yim  ' s the man on board who  ' s got the
unenviable task I feel in some respects with Glory St Pauls because we
haven't seen him finish off a race strongly yet and <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#85:1:B>
ah all we  ' ve seen him do is pull and be very keen through the
early stages <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#86:1:B>
uhm not for me he  ' s got very warm indeed here tonight hot and uh
not taking the eye <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#87:1:A>
Winning Delights was well found in the betting last time Mark
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-014#88:1:A>
did run an improved race without threatening and <,> uh comes in
well in the weights here is improving all the time but ah probably not just
yet for my uh based what I thought on the form but heading in the right
direction <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-014#89:1:B>
He just looks to me as though he fails to hit the line
strongly he gets himself into a position where you you think he should run
well and then the response looks to be a bit disappointing to me he appears
to hit a flat spot and not really come through with it <,> </I>
