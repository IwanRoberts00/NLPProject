2. Anthropology and Christology in Christian-Confucian Dialogue </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-005#2:1>
Anthropology and Christology are two closely related issues in
Confucian-Christian dialogue .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#3:1>
This can be seen in the six issues raised in the Confucian-Christian
dialogue among Tsai Jen-hou , Ch'ou Lien-hua , Liang Yen-cheng &obrack; Leung
In-shing &cbrack; in 1981 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#4:1>
Tsai , a representative of contemporary Confucianism , suggests that ,
in Confucianism , all human beings can become sages potentially , while it is
difficult for Christianity to adopt the idea that &ldquo; all human beings
can become Christ &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#5:1>
Tsai argues that in principle the union between Christ and the human
being is significantly different from the unity of Heaven and humanity .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#6:1>
While the former is a kind of subject &obrack;  God)-object &obrack; human
&cbrack; relationship , the latter is possible only by human effort , which
is grounded in human subjectivity .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#7:1>
Therefore , even though Christianity can make the claim that all human
beings can become Christ , its meaning is not equivalent to &ldquo; all human
beings can become sage and real man &rdquo; in Confucianism .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#8:1>
The second question raised by Tsai is whether Jesus is human or divine
, a strictly Christological question .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#9:1>
According to Tsai , in Christianity , the divinity of Jesus Christ is
highly emphasized so much so that Jesus  '  way of &ldquo; from human to divine
&rdquo; is overlooked .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#10:1>
Tsai suggests that if Christianity is able to recognize the approach
of &ldquo; Christology from below &rdquo; , there will be a significant
common ground between Christianity and Confucianism . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-005#11:1>
Two important observations have to be made with regard to Tsai  ' s
suggestion .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#12:1>
Firstly , Tsai does not refute the divinity of Jesus .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#13:1>
He admits that &ldquo; from-divine-to-human &rdquo; and &ldquo;
from-human-to-divine &rdquo; are two sides of the same coin .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#14:1>
The integration of these two perspectives can form a more
comprehensive picture of the person of Jesus Christ .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#15:1>
Secondly , Tsai contends that Jesus  '  way of &ldquo; from human to
divine &rdquo; and the Confucian way of &ldquo; all human being can become
sage &rdquo; will form a ground for dialogue .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#16:1>
For Tsai , both Jesus and Confucius can be considered as human beings
who had undergone a process of &ldquo; from finite to infinite &rdquo;
through their obedience and self-cultivation respectively .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#17:1>
In this case , there is an ontological ground to talk about &ldquo;
all human beings can become Christ . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#18:1>
The model of &ldquo; Christology from below &rdquo; entails that
Jesus , like all other human beings , lived as a normal human being and
exemplifies the way of &ldquo; from finite to infinite &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#19:1>
We can clearly see that Christology and anthropology are the two
fundamental and closely related loci of the Christian-Confucian dialogue .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-005#20:1>
Anthropology has long been regarded as a crucial issue in
Confucian-Christian dialogue .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#21:1>
In her book Confucianism and Christianity &obrack; 1977 &cbrack; ,
Julia Ching suggests that there are some basic differences between these two
religions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#22:1>
Firstly , while Confucianism focuses more upon human perfectibility ,
Christianity tends to stress human fallibility .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#23:1>
Secondly , Confucianism emphasizes the harmonious relationship
between human , society and the universe , while Christianity seems to
support the idea of human being at war within oneself and one  ' s sinful
nature .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#24:1>
Ching further suggests that where Confucian theory shows more sense
of self-reliance , Protestant theology insists upon faith alone and exclusive
dependence on God  ' s power .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#25:1>
Ching  ' s characterization of the two traditions seems to imply that
Christianity &obrack; especially Protestantism &cbrack; is a way of relying
on other-power and tends to focus on the negative side of human being , while
Confucianism is a way of relying on self-power and tends to focus on the
positive side of humanity .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#26:1>
Ching  ' s contrasting characterization of the two traditions may have
over-simplified the actual case .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#27:1>
Actually , Confucianism also regards moral evil and the imperfect
existential status as both realistic conditions of humanity .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#28:1>
Furthermore , Christianity also seeks for the sanctification of human
being and it does not negate the crucial role of human effort in the process
of attaining perfection even though the importance of human faith and
reliance on a transcendent God is stressed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#29:1>
As Au Kin-ming  ' s comparative study of the understanding of human
condition by Chu Hsi and that of Paul Tillich points out , both asserts the
original goodness of human nature , which is the potential nature of human
being prior to its existence .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#30:1>
Moreover , both assert the distinction or polarity between the
original nature and the existential nature or condition .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#31:1>
This polarity is one of the major keys to understanding human
selfishness and sinfulness .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#32:1>
In this respect , there are dissimilarities as well as similarities
between the Christian and Confucian understanding of humanity .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#33:1>
In short they are not incommensurable or inevitable contradicting
each other .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#34:1>
However , Ching remains quite right when she suggests that both
traditions have an understanding of faith in human being as openness to the
transcendent . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-005#35:1>
According to Tang Yi-jie , a scholar of Chinese philosophy , in
Confucianism , what is called immanence should refer to the innate nature of
the human person , that is to say , the spirit which makes a human being a
human being , e.g. <indig> jen </indig> &obrack; humaneness &cbrack; ; and
what is called transcendence should refer to the basic of the cosmos  ' 
existence or the ontological nature of the cosmos , that is , &lsquo; what makes
existence existence &rsquo; , e.g. the way of Heaven &obrack; <indig> t'ien-tao
</indig> <O> Chinese-characters </O> &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#36:1>
The idea of Unity of Heaven and Humanity , &obrack; <indig>
t'ien-jen-ho-i </indig> <O> Chinese-characters </O> &cbrack; in Confucianism
means that the transcendence and immanence are in unity , which is the ideal
rather than the existential state of human being .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#37:1>
The transcendence is not the Wholly Other; rather , it is immanent in
nature .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#38:1>
Therefore , the way of Heaven &obrack; <indig> t'ien-tao </indig> <O>
Chinese-characters </O> &cbrack; is itself immanently transcendent and the
human nature &obrack; <indig> jen-hsing </indig> <O> Chinese-characters </O>
&cbrack; is not only immanent , but also transcendent . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-005#39:1>
The question of anthropology in Christianity and Confucianism is
closely related to the problem of transcendence and immanence , which seems
to be a divisive issue in Christian-Confucian dialogue because Christianity
seems to assume the distinction , and even separation of them , whereas
Confucianism holds that transcendence and immanence are united . <X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#X40:1>
As Liu Shu-hsien puts it , <O> quotation </O> </X> However , this
generalized picture is questioned by both the Christian and Confucian sides .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#41:1>
From the Confucian side , Liu Shu-hsien suggests that although
Christianity and Confucianism hold different views on the issue of
transcendence and immanence , they share several common points .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#42:1>
First , based on the concept of the image of God , Christianity also
asserts the goodness of human nature; whereas , it is mistaken to say that
Confucianism is optimistic on the perfection of human being .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#43:1>
Second , Confucianism holds that &rdquo; <quote> it is a long and
arduous way for scholars to follow the steps of sages and worthies </quote>
&rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#44:1>
That means there is a tension between the ideal and the existential
state of human being . <X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#X45:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The Confucian ideal is one thing , the practice is
another. &rdquo; </quote> </X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#46:1>
Third , as Liu points out , Christian theology/philosophy also
absorbs the idea of process philosophy and humanism in order to develop their
immanent dimension of the transcendence . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-005#47:1>
From the Christian side , Gerhold Becker admits that although
both traditions direct human being towards the ultimate , Confucianism
discovers the ultimate immanent in human being whereas Christianity finds
meaning in the ultimate only by transcending human being and his/her world
and by going beyond nature in the most radical sense .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#48:1>
However , Becker qualifies that in Christian theology , the infinite
qualitative difference between God and human would not eliminate the intimate
relationship between both .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#49:1>
In Christology , the ontological gap between God and human being is
bridgeable and the redemptive act of Christ bestowed on human being me
capability to transform his/her life into that of ultimate harmony between
himself/herself and God .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#50:1>
Becker further points out the so-called anthropological turn in
modern theology advocated by Max Scheler , Paul Tillich and Karl Rahner .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#51:1>
These Christian thinkers attempted to show that the idea of the
ultimate is entailed in human being as the ground of his/her being which
calls him/her beyond himself/herself towards the all-embracing mystery of God .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#52:1>
Lastly , Becker suggests that the transcendental idea of Christianity
may have the potential to develop a considerable critical function .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#53:1>
Compare with Buddhism and Confucianism , this transcendental
dimension can help Christianity to keep a distance from the world without
rejecting it together and to be involved in the world without too much
adjusting to it . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-005#54:1>
From the above brief survey of the Christian-Confucian dialogue ,
we can find that both parties think that the contrast between Christianity
and Confucianism are not absolute , though they have their respective views
of human nature .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#55:1>
Both Christianity and Confucianism hold the original goodness of
human nature and that the existential nature of human being is not the ideal
condition .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#56:1>
It is quite possible for Christianity to recognize human sinfulness
without negating the original created human goodness and to interpret the
saving act of Jesus Christ as the restoration of the original goodness of
human .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#57:1>
However , it is noteworthy that Christology does not play an
important role in the dialogue on anthropology .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#58:1>
Although some Christian scholars attempted to base their
anthropologies on the doctrine of Christ , the discussion about Christology
in Confucian-Christian dialogue remains rather few .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#59:1>
&obrack; At least &cbrack; , Tsai  ' s question about &ldquo;
Christology from above or from below &rdquo; has been largely neglected .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#60:1>
Precisely at this juncture , Barth  ' s Christological anthropology may
enrich the dialogue . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#61:1>
3. Karl Barth  ' s Anthropology : &ldquo; Real Man &rdquo; and &ldquo;
Real Humanity &rdquo; </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#62:1>
3.1 Jesus Christ as the Starting Point </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-005#63:1>
For Barth , the inquiry concerning human nature necessarily
involves the fundamental methodological question of the proper approach to
deal with the problem of humanity .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#64:1>
In the section &ldquo; Phenomena of the Human &rdquo; , Barth
suggests that since all the findings of the self-understanding of human being
concern only the &ldquo; phenomena &rdquo; which are &ldquo; neutral ,
relative and ambiguous &rdquo; , the result of any self-interpretation of
human beings is only a &ldquo; vicious circle &rdquo; because there is no
point of reference which is outside human being to interpret themselves .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#65:1>
In another place , Barth further suggests that a true understanding
of human being can be attained not from human self-understanding , but from
Jesus Christ , the real human being .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#66:1>
This important passage is worth quoting in full for it provides the
key to the following discussion .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#67:1>
<O> quotation </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-005#68:1>
According to Barth , <quote> <it> a true understanding of real
humanity is to start not with human self-knowledge but with Jesus , the real
human being </it> </quote> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#69:1>
Barth affirms the followings :

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#70:1>
&obrack; 1 &cbrack; Only Jesus is the real human being before God;
&obrack;

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#71:1>
2 &cbrack; We , human being , are not real in the sense that we exist
without in a &ldquo; real reality &rdquo; &obrack;

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#72:1>
3 &cbrack; Human being is in a continuity with God in Christ , even
if he or she is not a Christian . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-005#73:1>
The real nature of humanity , for Barth , is primarily found not
in Adam , but in Christ .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#74:1>
In his <it> Christ and Adam </it> , Barth finds that &rdquo; <quote>
the relationship between Adam and us reveals not the primary but only the
secondary anthropological truth and ordering principle </quote> . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#75:1>
The primary truth and principle is to be found in Jesus Christ .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#76:1>
Barth holds that the relationship between Adam and us must be
interpreted in the perspective of the relationship between Christ and us ,
even though Christ is called &ldquo; the second Adam &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#77:1>
The reason is that it is &rdquo; <quote> Christ who vouches for the
authenticity of Adam and not Adam who vouches for the authenticity of Christ .
</quote> &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#78:1>
In Barth  ' s understanding , the authentic human nature of Christ is
not to be seen from the perspective of Adam; instead , the latter is to be
understood from the humanity of Christ , which reveals what a real human
being is .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#79:1>
Only with this perspective , we can put the humanity of Adam in
proper context .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#80:1>
As Barth puts it , <quote> &ldquo; The same human nature appears in
both &obrack; Christ and Adam &cbrack; but the humanity of Adam is only real
and genuine in so far as it reflects and corresponds to the humanity of
Christ . </quote> &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#81:1>
In sum , our relationship to Christ provides an essential and
superior priority over our relationship to Adam .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#82:1>
Adam is only the &ldquo; provisional copy &rdquo; of the real
humanity that is in Christ . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#83:1>
3.2 &ldquo; Real Man &rdquo; : The Ontological Relation between God
and Human Being </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-005#84:1>
For Barth , the only alternative for a true understanding of real
humanity is to start with the real human being Jesus instead of human
self-knowledge .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#85:1>
That means the history of Jesus provides the form and material
content for us to understand the meaning of real human being .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#86:1>
Barth asserts that since the man Jesus is for God &obrack; for His
presence , His divine deliverance , and therefore for His own glory , freedom
and love &cbrack; , the human being as the being in the history &obrack;
<foreign> <it> Geschichte </it> </foreign> &cbrack; of Jesus  '  humanity also
shares the &ldquo; ontological determination &rdquo; &obrack; <it> <foreign>
ontologische Bestimmung </foreign> </it> &cbrack; shaped by the history of
Jesus Christ . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-005#87:1>
According to McLean , Barth distinguishes between the formal and
the material dimension of a real human being .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#88:1>
The formal perspective of real human being , for Barth , is &ldquo;
to be a man is to be with God .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#89:1>
&rdquo; In this sense , no human being is without God . <X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#X90:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Whatever else he is , he is on the basis of the fact
that he is with Jesus and therefore with God . &rdquo; </quote> </X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#91:1>
Even though the human being exists in a godless way in an existential
sense , ontologically speaking , it is impossible for a human being to be
without God .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#92:1>
It is because &rdquo; <quote> the fact that we are with God is not
merely one of many determinations of our being , derivative and mutable , but
the basic determination , original and immutable . &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#93:1>
For this reason , Barth names the unreality of human existence as
&rdquo; <quote> ontological impossible </quote> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#94:1>
&rdquo; According to the ontological determination of man , when one
chooses evil and enters into conflict with God , he is making himself
impossible . &rdquo; 

<ICE-HK:W2A-005#95:1>
Real human being is never genuinely godless . </p> </I>
