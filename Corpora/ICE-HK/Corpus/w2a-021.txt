Infections of the Central Nervous System </h> </bold> <bold> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#4:1>
In Hong Kong , infections of the central nervous system &obrack;
CNS &cbrack; have always been a significant cause of mortality and morbidity .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#5:1>
Generally speaking , as a society develops and its standard of medical
and health care improves , one would expect a progressive decline in the
incidence of infectious diseases .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#6:1>
However , a review of the statistics on CNS infections in Hong Kong
showed that this has not been the case &obrack; Table 10.1 &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#7:1>
Taking the case of tuberculosis &obrack; TB &cbrack; as an example
, statistics from the government showed that the total number of TB cases in
general and TB meningitis in particular showed no significant change over the
last 11 years . <sp> <fnr> 19 </fnr> </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#8:1>
In fact there appears to be a rising trend in the number of new
cases of TB infection in the recent 2 years .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#9:1>
This observation is explained by the close proximity of Hong Kong to
China , where poverty and infection are still major problems .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#10:1>
In neighbouring provinces across the Chinese border , public health
standards are still in a developing stage .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#11:1>
TB is particularly rampant . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#12:1>
Over the years , neurosurgeons have been actively involved in the
overall management of different kinds of CNS infections .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#13:1>
From helping in the initial diagnosis to managing the complications
of various infections , we have worked closely with our colleagues in other
specialties .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#14:1>
Our neurosurgeons have acquired vast experience in dealing with a
large variety of infections , ranging from the common to the very rare cases .
</p> <bold> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#15:1>
MENINGITIS </h> </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#16:1>
The commonest infection of the CNS by far is meningitis .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#17:1>
In spite of recent advances and the availability of many new and
potent antimicrobial treatments , meningitis still <O> TABLE </O> carries a
formidable mortality rate .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#18:1>
Delayed diagnosis often leads to severe and permanent morbidity .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#19:1>
A high index of suspicion is very important , especially in cases
where meningeal signs and fever may not be present initially .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#20:1>
Those at risk include the very young and those taking steroids . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#21:1>
Another worrying trend is an increasing number of patients
presenting with partially treated bacterial meningitis .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#22:1>
For every case of confirmed bacterial meningitis , there are two to
three cases of meningitis due to unspecified cause .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#23:1>
Most of these represent partially treated cases where the causative
bacteria cannot be cultured . <sp> <fnr> 14 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#24:1>
Local citizens have a tendency to visit multiple practitioners over a
short period of time .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#25:1>
Some local physicians also harbour a cavalier attitude in prescribing
antibiotics .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#26:1>
This results in a real risk of delayed diagnosis of meningitis with
dire consequences . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#27:1>
For those cases of chronic or subacute meningitis caused by TB or
cryptococcus , meningeal signs may not be apparent .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#28:1>
Many such cases are diagnosed only after neurosurgical consultation ,
when lumbar puncture would be performed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#29:1>
The following statistics &obrack; Table 10.2 &cbrack; were
collected from all hospitals &obrack; private and government/hospital
authority &cbrack; in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#30:1>
They show the incidence of meningitis caused by all kinds of
infective agents <sp> <fnr> 4-13 </fnr> </sp> and highlight the fact that
even today meningitis still causes significant mortality : one will also note
that there is no significant change in the <O> TABLE </O> incidence or the
result of treatment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#31:1>
Apart from bacterial and viral meningitis , TB meningitis is a
rather common occurrence , as shown in table 10.1 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#32:1>
This explains the great interest in this topic , leading to many
reports and studies published by our colleagues in the fields of neurology ,
neuroradiology and neurosurgery .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#33:1>
Their efforts add to our ever-increasing knowledge of these disease
processes and contribute to better results in the management of this disease .
<sp> <fnr> 15 , 17 , 20 </fnr> </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#34:1>
Although cases of meningitis are primarily managed by physicians
and paediatricians , neurosurgeons are often involved in the management when
complications arise .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#35:1>
These complications include ventriculitis , hydrocephalus , granuloma
and abscess formation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#36:1>
Surgical procedures include insertion of ventricular catheters and
reservoirs for intra-ventricular antibiotics , shunting operations for
hydrocephalus and excision or drainage of brain abscess or granuloma . </p>
<bold> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#37:1>
ABSCESS FORMATION IN THE CNS </h> </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#38:1>
Brain and spinal abscess formation are by no means uncommon in
Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#39:1>
The following statistics from Queen Elizabeth Hospital &obrack; Table
10.3 &cbrack; , one of the large Neurosurgical Units in town , illustrate the
kinds of abscesses managed by Hong Kong neurosurgeons . </p> <O> TABLE </O>
<bold> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#40:1>
VIRAL INFECTIONS </h> </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#41:1>
Viral infections of the CNS are common .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#42:1>
Fortunately most cases resolve without complications .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#43:1>
However , viral encephalitis sometimes results in life-threatening
cerebral oedema , and neurosurgical assistance is called for .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#44:1>
Surgical procedures include insertion of catheter for intracranial
pressure monitoring and brain biopsy to confirm the diagnosis .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#45:1>
Cases of postinfectious viral transverse myelitis have also been
encountered , although not frequently . <sp> <fnr> 3 </fnr> </sp> </p> <bold>
<h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#46:1>
FUNGAL INFECTIONS </h> </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#47:1>
The most common fungal infection of the CNS seen locally is
cryptococcal meningitis .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#48:1>
Infection by Cryptococcus neoformans leads to inflammation of
meninges and blood vessels .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#49:1>
Patients may present acutely with symptoms of diffuse encephalitis .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#50:1>
Other times the disease may take a subacute or even chronic course ,
without much meningeal sign .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#51:1>
Chronic headache and cranial nerve palsy may be the only complaint .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#52:1>
The mainstay of treatment is the use of antifungal agents like
amphotericin B , 5-flurocytosine or derivatives of the imidazole group .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#53:1>
A local case where the meningitis recurred over a period of 5 years
in spite of treatment has been reported . <sp> <fnr> 23 </fnr> </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#54:1>
In addition to antifungal treatment , ventriculoperitoneal
shunting operations may be necessary for cases complicated by hydrocephalus .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#55:1>
No case of spread to the peritoneal cavity has been recorded . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#56:1>
Occasional cases of fungal abscesses have also been seen .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#57:1>
Craniotomy and drainage of pus together with antifungal treatment
gave successful results .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#58:1>
Isolated cases of rarer fungal infection like cerebral aspergillosis
have also been reported . <sp> <fnr> 16 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#59:1>
At the time of writing , a case of aspergillosis mycotic aneurysm has
been diagnosed by the team in Tuen Mun Hospital and will soon be reported .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#60:1>
The majority of current and past patients with fungal infection were
not associated with AIDS or other immunosuppression state . </p> <bold> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#61:1>
PARASITIC INFESTATION </h> </bold> <bold> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#62:1>
Cysticercosis </h> </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#63:1>
The commonest parasitic infestation of the CNS seen in Hong Kong
is cysticercosis .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#64:1>
Patients become infected after ingesting larvae of Taenia solium in
<-> under-cocked </-> <+> under-cooked </+> pork .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#65:1>
Although the Hong Kong government has stringent rules governing the
slaughter and distribution of pork , this is not the case in Mainland China .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#66:1>
Many patients are infected while travelling to China .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#67:1>
As it is not a notifiable disease , no comprehensive data about the
incidence of cysticercosis is available .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#68:1>
From personal communications with various local centers , the author
estimates an incidence of around 10 to 15 new cases per year .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#69:1>
With more cross-border traffic , the incidence is expected to rise
further . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#70:1>
In most cases the diagnosis of cerebral cysticercosis is obvious
when a computed tomography &obrack; CT &cbrack; or magnetic resonance
&obrack; MR &cbrack; scan shows widespread multiple cystic lesions in the
parenchyma of the brain .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#71:1>
Sometimes however a solitary cyst may be the only manifestation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#72:1>
The author has had the experience of removing an intact larval cyst
from within the spinal dural sac while exploring a case of nerve root
compression .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#73:1>
There was no other lesion detectable elsewhere . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#74:1>
Other diagnostic pitfalls include missing the diagnosis by only
requesting a nonenchance CT scan .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#75:1>
In the early stages of the disease , before calcifications occur in
the cyst wall , the cysts may only be visible after contrast injection . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#76:1>
Management by the antihelmintic praziquantel is usually
successful , although sometimes massive inflammatory responses occur and may
even cause cerebral infarct . <sp> <fnr> 22 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#77:1>
Neurosurgery is reserved for cases complicated by hydrocephalus or
cystic compression on neural structures . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#78:1>
<bold> Sparganosis </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#79:1>
Another peculiar larval infestation of the CNS seen in Hong Kong
is Sparganosis .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#80:1>
In theses local cases migrating larvae of Diphyllobothrium mansoni
most likely enter the human body through drinking water contaminated with
infected Cyclops .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#81:1>
Hong Kong  ' s drinking water is recognized as safe by the World Health
Organization .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#82:1>
The majority of local cases were probably infected in China where
clean drinking water is not guaranteed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#83:1>
Back in 1987 , this condition was supposed to be of very rare
occurrence and only eight cases had been reported world-wide .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#84:1>
However , the author published two personal cases encountered in 1986
and 1987 , <sp> <fnr> 1 </fnr> </sp> and predicated a much higher incidence
once this disease became better known and the differential diagnosis is
considered in relevant cases .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#85:1>
Since then , more cases have been found locally <sp> <fnr> 14 </fnr>
</sp> and this condition is now recognized to be more common in Hong Kong and
neighbouring Southern China . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#86:1>
Presenting as granulomas in the brain or spinal cord , the
diagnosis was confirmed only after histological specimen was available
through exploration and biopsy .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#87:1>
In one of the author  ' s cases a 5-inch long larva was literally
caught from within an intraparenchymal granuloma at exploration for a case of
suspected glioma . </p> <bold> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#88:1>
AIDS ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS </h> </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#89:1>
With the increasing prevalence of the Acquired Immunodeficiency
Syndrome &obrack; AIDS &cbrack; in Hong Kong , a higher incidence of CNS
infections associated with the syndrome is to be expected .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#90:1>
Indeed cases of brain abscess in AIDS patients have been encountered .
<sp> <fnr> 18 </fnr> </sp> </p> <bold> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#91:1>
OTHER MISCELLANEOUS INFECTIONS </h> </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#92:1>
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was first reported locally in 1987 .
</p> <sp> <fnr> 2 </fnr> </sp>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#93:1>
Cases of amoebic meningoencephalitis due to Naegleria fowleri
have also been seen locally .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#94:1>
Again in most cases the exposure was thought to have happened in
China .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#95:1>
The mortality was very high as diagnosis was often delayed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#96:1>
Yet successful treatment was reported in a 38-year-old man . <sp>
<fnr> 21 </fnr> </sp> </p> <bold> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#97:1>
SUMMARY </h> </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#98:1>
Hong Kong is one of the world  ' s most sophisticated metropolises
with an advanced medical and health system .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#99:1>
Yet due to her close historic connection with China , infective
diseases of the CNS have always been a common occurrence .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#100:1>
Now after her reunification with China in 1997 , cross-border
traffic is expected to grow at an ever-increasing rate .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#101:1>
Infections of the CNS will certainly remain a major focus of our
neurosurgical practice . </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#105:2>
The spinal cord , perhaps because of its simpler anatomy and
smaller size , has less pathology than its cerebral counterpart .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#106:2>
While it is enclosed in a bony canal , well protected by muscles and
bone , its function is very much dependent on the well being of the vertebrae
and intervertebral structures such as disc and joints .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#107:2>
Therefore , in managing spinal pathologies , the surgeons have to be
conversant not only with the respective nervous diseases but also diseases of
the bone and joints , and the biomechanics of the spine as a whole . </p>
<bold> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#108:2>
THE PAST </h> </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#109:2>
In the early days of neurosurgical services in Hong Kong , due
to the paucity of resources , material or human alike , focus was set only on
the brain .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#110:2>
The rest of the central nervous system , the vertebrae in particular
, was left to the orthopaedic colleagues .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#111:2>
Coupled to the longer history and good reputation of orthopaedics in
Hong Kong , it had been the common practice for family physicians to refer
patients with problems related to the spine first to the orthopaedic surgeons .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#112:2>
It was then up to the orthopaedic surgeons to refer to neurosurgeons
those they found in apt to handle . </p> <bold> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#113:2>
THE PRESENT </h> </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#114:2>
Through the years , as neuroimaging technology advances ,
diagnosis can be made with greater ease and confidence .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#115:2>
Problems are classified earlier in the course of treatment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#116:2>
This helps to define our territory to diseases within the dura .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#117:2>
Unlike our counterparts abroad , we manage just a very small
proportion of degenerative spinal disease . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#118:2>
Most of us believe that we should be more active in the
management of bony spinal <O> 2-PHOTOS </O> pathologies such as degenerative
spinal disease and spinal trauma .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#119:2>
There are two reasons .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#120:2>
First , the clinical indications of spinal surgery are usually
neurological in nature .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#121:2>
A neurosurgeon is undoubtedly in the best position to assess and
predict the outcome of the treatment program .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#122:2>
Second , with our traditional meticulous care in tissue handling ,
we are well capable to work on the spine with the least trauma . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#123:2>
At present , we are able to provide treatment to a large variety
of these conditions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#124:2>
The following three cases illustrate the scope of service we are
currently providing . </p> <bold> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#125:2>
Case 1 </h> </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#126:2>
A 6-year-old boy presented with 2 months  '  history of neck pain
followed by weakness of all limbs .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#127:2>
Physical examination demonstrated mild spastic tetraparesis .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#128:2>
Sphincter functions and sensation were intact .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#129:2>
X-ray of the cervical spine was normal .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#130:2>
Magnetic resonance &obrack; MR &cbrack; imaging &obrack; Fig. 11.1A
&cbrack; showed an intradural cystic lesion lying anterior to the spinal cord
with signal intensity similar to cerebral spinal fluid .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#131:2>
It extended from <O> 2-PHOTOS </O> C4 to C6 level .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#132:2>
The spinal cord was badly compressed and deformed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#133:2>
After the scan , there was rapid deterioration of neurological
signs including respiratory distress , acute urinary retention and
progressive tetraparesis .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#134:2>
Urgent anterior corpectomy at the level of C4-C7 was done .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#135:2>
Intraoperative finding showed a thin walled , tense whitish cyst
containing turbid yellowish fluid .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#136:2>
For an area of around 3 mm in diameter , the cyst was firmly
attached to the anterior surface of the cord .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#137:2>
Total excision was achieved .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#138:2>
The C4-C7 corpectomy was subsequently stabilised with a fibular
strut graft .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#139:2>
The pathology was neurenteric cyst . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#140:2>
The patient was put on a Philadelphia collar for 3 months .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#141:2>
Neurological improvement was remarkable and by the end of 3 months ,
the patient was free of symptoms .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#142:2>
Follow-up MR imaging &obrack; Fig. 11.1B &cbrack; showed complete
resolution of the cyst with satisfactory alignment of the bone graft . </p>
<bold> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#143:2>
Case 2 </h> </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#144:2>
A 31-year-old lady complained of progressive left upper limb
weakness for 3 years .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#145:2>
Physical examination showed marked wasting of small muscles of both
hands with loss of pinprick sensation at C7-T1 level on the right side .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#146:2>
On the left side , there was loss of pinprick and temperature
sensation at C6-T1 level .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#147:2>
The lower limb functions were normal .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#148:2>
Sphincter functions were normal . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#149:2>
MR imaging &obrack; Fig. 11.2A &cbrack; of the cervical spine
showed a sausage shape tumour practically <O> 2-PHOTOS </O> occupying the
whole thecal sac at C2-T1 level .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#150:2>
No normal spinal cord was visualised in the intervening level .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#151:2>
There was syringobulbia extending down to the superior surface of
the tumour .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#152:2>
Preoperative somato-sensory evoked potential &obrack; SSEP &cbrack;
was normal in both upper and lower limbs . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#153:2>
Laminectomy at C2-T1 level was done .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#154:2>
Through a midline myelotomy , the tumour was found to be firm in
consistency and was adherent to the cord tissue .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#155:2>
Though difficult , it was possible to create a cleavage plane
between the tumour and spinal cord by careful dissection from the cephalic
end .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#156:2>
Total excision was achieved .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#157:2>
Stabilisation was achieved by posterior fixation from C2 to T1 level
using two titanium rods and bone graft .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#158:2>
Intraoperative SSEP recorded a reduction of the amplitude of the
cortical response from the lower limbs .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#159:2>
The tumour was an ependymoma . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#160:2>
After surgery , the patient was put on a halo-jacket for 6 weeks .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#161:2>
MR imaging &obrack; Fig. 11.2B &cbrack; 1 year later showed no
recurrence .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#162:2>
In the latest follow-up , there is good recovery of the function of
the small muscles of both hands to grade 4 power .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#163:2>
Sensory loss , however persist .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#164:2>
Proprioception of both lower limbs is normal .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#165:2>
The remaining complaint is the pain and stiffness associated with
extensive spinal fixation . </p> <bold> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#166:2>
Case 3 </h> </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#167:2>
A 6-year-old boy with neonatal asphyxia and spastic diplegia was
referred for surgical treatment of spasticity .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#168:2>
Physical examination showed bilateral ankle clonus and marked tone
increase in the adductors and , to a lesser extent , the abductors of the hip .

He could only stand for a few seconds at a time and walk in a very
unstable gait with two walking-sticks .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#170:2>
The primary problem was spasticity causing poor hip control . </p>

Selective dorsal root rhizotomy &obrack; Fig. 11.3 &cbrack;
under motor nerve stimulator monitoring &obrack; Fig. 11.4 &cbrack; was done .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#172:2>
After surgery , the tone in both hips was markedly reduced and
bilateral ankle clonus abolished completely .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#173:2>
Despite mild weakness of the respective muscle group initially ,
with continuing intensive physiotherapy which is indeed an integral pat of
the rhizotomy program , he was able to stand and walk much faster unaided
after 3 months . </p>

These three cases vary in complexity and yet have one thing in
common .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#175:2>
In the course of surgery , we found it important to use
electrophysiological monitoring to guide us through the spinal cord .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#176:2>
In recent years , local neurosurgeons like to have intraoperative
monitoring backup in spinal work .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#177:2>
This has incurred additional strain on the already depleted service
of the neurologists and the electrodiagnostic units .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#178:2>
In turn , this adds to our difficulty in handling complicated cases
with the greatest confidence and safety . </p> <bold> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#179:2>
THE FUTURE </h> </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#180:2>
Knowing our capability in treating spine pathology , we are
trying to get more recognition , and perhaps a fairer share in the field of
spinal surgery .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#181:2>
Only with better coordination and pooling of resources and referrals
among ourselves can we provide an environment conducive to cultivating this
subspecialty .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#182:2>
Only when some of us are able to spend most if not all of our time
doing spinal surgery can the expertise expand well and fast enough .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#183:2>
These call for better co-operation and a major restructuring of our
current practice .

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#184:2>
In the author  ' s opinion , this is a job for the Neurosurgical
Specialty Board of the College of Surgeons and the neurosurgical community at
large . </p> <bold> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-021#185:2>
CONCLUSION </h> </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-021#186:2>
At the turn of the new century , whether our neurosurgical
service can move forward and improve the quality of our care to spine
patients depends much on our courage to radically change the existing
structure . </p> </I>
