<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-056#1:1:A>
Uhm I think a few months ago one of the faculty members
actually called us okay at the Reference Counter

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#2:1:A>
And then uhm I guided this faculty member all the way to order a
thesis online in the ProQuest okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#3:1:A>
And then after two minutes okay after two minutes time he called me
back

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#4:1:A>
And then he said oh you know Antonia I  ' ve already got the thesis
downloaded into my PC already okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#5:1:A>
It only took took him about two minutes time to get the thesis so if
you are if you desperately would like to get hold of the full text okay
almost immediately you might consider you might wish to consider getting the
online version okay because it is pretty quick okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#6:1:A>
So if you would like to get it okay click on order it now and then
it costs you twenty nine dollars and fifty cents

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#7:1:A>
And mind you this is not Hong Kong dollars

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#8:1:A>
This is US dollars

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#9:1:A>
US currency okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#10:1:A>
And if you would like to get it then you just proceed with the
online order okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#11:1:A>
Key in your credit card number and all that and then you know after
two or three minutes time you will be informed as to how to download the
thesis out of the web okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#12:1:A>
Right so any questions

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#13:1:A>
So that  ' s for ProQuest okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#14:1:A>
So that  ' s actually I think the uhm web the <.> data </.> databases
for uhm thesis okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#15:1:A>
Now so let  ' s proceed to the uhm second batch of questions okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#16:1:A>
Uhm that would be on Hong Kong UTO okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#17:1:A>
So you click to the second page of the exercise sheet

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#18:1:A>
Okay I  ' d like you to go to Hong Kong UTO okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#19:1:A>
So if you go back to the homepage click on the Hong Kong UL Digital
Initiatives and then go to Hong Kong University Thesis Online okay <,,> you  ' ll
get to this page okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#20:1:A>
So may be I  ' ll give you uhm five minutes to complete both question
number one and question number two okay <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#21:1:A>
Okay so uhm what have you learnt in this Hong Kong UTO exercise
okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#22:1:A>
Several things

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#23:1:A>
Do remember use the and operator again okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#24:1:A>
I  ' m very longwinded but then that  ' s very important okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#25:1:A>
So do not type in higher education in Guangzhou okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#26:1:A>
Should be higher education and Guangzhou okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#27:1:A>
Use and the operator okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#28:1:A>
And then of course you can specify the field for searching okay
because you  ' re not too sure whether you know the words higher education and
Guangzhou would appear in the title or in the subject okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#29:1:A>
So the safest way would be select anywhere okay right

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#30:1:A>
And in fact you can also specific the time period okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#31:1:A>
And in the case two thousand one to two thousand one okay because
we know that the thesis was published in two thousand and one okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#32:1:A>
So basically if you follow this you should be able to get the
answer right

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#33:1:A>
Which is marketization of higher education the case study of
Guangzhou Hong Kong uh China okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#34:1:A>
So basically if you type in higher education in Guangzhou you
wouldn't be able to get this record okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#35:1:A>
Because you can't find this phrase in this record

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#36:1:A>
Can you see okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#37:1:A>
So once you  ' ve got it okay there are actually two copies of this
thesis okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#38:1:A>
One placed in the Education library and the other copy in the
Special Collections okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#39:1:A>
For uh thesis by Education students they usually have to submit two
copies for us

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#40:1:A>
One uhm to be uh placed in the Education library and then the
second copy in the Special Collection okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#41:1:A>
For other faculty students okay we usually will have only one copy
which will be placed in the Special Collections only okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#42:1:A>
So if you would like to consult the thesis jot down the call number
okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#43:1:A>
In this case is M Ed zero one L one one one okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#44:1:A>
Now basically the call number of our thesis is built on the
programme name okay or the master  ' s or the uh degree programme abbreviation

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#45:1:A>
In this case M Ed Master in Education

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#46:1:A>
And o one would be <,> would be the year <.> st </.> uhm which
start at two thousand and one okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#47:1:A>
And if L one one one actually is a code that actually comes from
the author  ' s name okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#48:1:A>
The author  ' s name is Lai begin with L

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#49:1:A>
So we have L and then one one one is actually generated by computer
programme

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#50:1:A>
So that means for the year two thousand and one we have one unique
thesis for this call number only okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#51:1:A>
If there is another student with the last name begin with L the uh
that thesis will have a different L number okay right

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#52:1:A>
Now basically uhm <,,> basically for each record we have two link
as well okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#53:1:A>
Uh one is for table of content and the other one is the abstract
okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#54:1:A>
If you take your time to uhm click on the PDF icon for table of
content will actually get the table of contents displayed online and also the
PDF for the uhm abstract okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#55:1:A>
This will actually give you more information as to uh the content
of this thesis uh for you to decide on whether this thesis is relevant to
relevant to you or not okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#56:1:A>
So instead of just relying on the subjects indicated in the record
we can actually get a lot of more information about the uhm thesis before
went upstairs to get the full text to read it okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#57:1:A>
Now the last uh database that we are going to talk about is uhm
Index to Thesis okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#58:1:A>
The database that uh focuses on the thesis in Great Britain and
Ireland okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#59:1:A>
Now to go to this database you can follow the instructions I have
given you in the exercise sheet okay which is very complicated I would say
okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#60:1:A>
So I  ' m going to show you a more simple way to access this database
okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#61:1:A>
So if you stay with the screen for the Hong Kong UTO at the very
bottom you will see a link for relevant websites okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#62:1:A>
Click on that

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#63:1:A>
You will see a list of websites

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#64:1:A>
And in fact from this list you you will also see ProQuest Digital
Dissertations right over here as well okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#65:1:A>
And the same time you can also see Index to Thesis okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#66:1:A>
Now the other databases okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#67:1:A>
Mostly the other databases were actually the thesis will also be
contained in the ProQuest already okay so actually ProQuest will actually
help you to uhm search the other resources as well okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#68:1:A>
So basically Index to Thesis and ProQuest will be uh pretty
sufficient okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#69:1:A>
So let us click on Index to Thesis okay to access this database

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#70:1:A>
So in the future you do not have to uhm <,> you do not have to
remember the name of you know ProQuest Digital Dissertations or Index to
Thesis

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#71:1:A>
You just go to one single place which is the Hong Kong UTO page

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#72:1:A>
Go all the way down and then click on relevant websites from there
you  ' ll be <.> a </.> able to access all these databases or dissertations
okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#73:1:A>
Now our two thousand and two subscription okay is not activated yet
okay but we can search the older materials okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#74:1:A>
So if you click on search button on the left okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#75:1:A>
You  ' ll see uhm four different search method okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#76:1:A>
We have quick search simple search standard and advanced okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#77:1:A>
Uhm my favourite search interface here okay is the standard search
okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#78:1:A>
So click on the standard

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#79:1:A>
The reason why I prefer the standard search is that here you can
select the field for searching on this side okay right

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#80:1:A>
So like click on any field and then in the search box I can
actually uhm type in my search statement okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#81:1:A>
So I  ' ve one question for you for Index to Thesis okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#82:1:A>
That is okay what is the name of the student who wrote the thesis
about the personal and social development of <.> s </.> student leaders of
Hong Kong universities okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#83:1:A>
Now because this uhm thesis was done in uh UK uh university we  ' ll
select it back to the thesis this database to search okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#84:1:A>
So I  ' ll let you have two minutes to find out the answer <&> a long
pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#85:1:A>
Okay so all of you manage to get the uhm <O> tut </O> title right
okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#86:1:A>
So you will find that actually this uhm database the search
interface with this database is not as sophisticated as the ProQuest okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#87:1:A>
You cannot order the thesis online here okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#88:1:A>
So if you have a favourite if you have spotted a favourite thesis
in this database you cannot actually key in your credit card number and then
get it online or anything like as you have done in ProQuest okay right

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#89:1:A>
But anyway if you found a good thesis from this database you can
actually get it from the interlibrary loans okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#90:1:A>
Now very quickly I  ' ll go through okay uh for those who are not
aware of the online form okay I  ' ll very quickly go through how you can
actually get the thesis online uhm through or order the thesis online through
the interlibrary loans uhm service okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#91:1:A>
From the homepage if you go under e-forms <,> select Iliad okay
which is the interlibrary loans request form okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#92:1:A>
From this page since you are a Hong Kong U student okay click on
this link

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#93:1:A>
Then you can key in your information <,,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#94:1:A>
Now uh the information that you have to key in includes your name
okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#95:1:A>
You just key in your last name and then your student number okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#96:1:A>
For me I  ' ve keyed my <.> st </.> uh staff number and then the pin
okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#97:1:A>
Now uhm this is the same set of account that you will key in when
you try to renew your books online okay under uh View Your Circulation Record
in Dragon okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#98:1:A>
All right so you submit the information and then you have to
carefully read through the copyright declaration and then accept it okay if
you would like to accept it okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#99:1:A>
Uhm uhm okay now actually because I  ' ve been to my record already
okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#100:1:A>
If this is your first time go into your record you will have to
uhm confirm your personal information okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#101:1:A>
And then once you confirm the information you have to click on add
account okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#102:1:A>
Have you ever gone into your account okay right

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#103:1:A>
Uhm you click on add account and after that you exit and then you
will get into this page okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#104:1:A>
So in the future when you go into the Iliad form the first page
that you will see is this form okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#105:1:A>
So from this form you can actually request the photocopy of the
article or you can borrow a book from another library okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#106:1:A>
Provided that the item is now available in its library okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#107:1:A>
Or if you have made you submissions you can view your requests
here okay right

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#108:1:A>
So I  ' ve requested the book from another library and is still
awaiting condition processing okay right exit <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#109:1:A>
And uhm you can check your personal information

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#110:1:A>
Can change your user information here okay okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#111:1:A>
So actually this is the page that you will see when you first for
first-time users okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#112:1:A>
So you just confirm your information submitted okay and then <,>
okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#113:1:A>
So that  ' s how you request your materials through the interlibrary
loans uh service okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#114:1:A>
So you have one hundred and twenty five three requests for each of
the item here okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#115:1:A>
So any questions

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#116:1:A>
All right

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#117:1:A>
Now if not uhm <,> uhm I  ' ll show you how to access the resources
from home right <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#118:1:A>
Now in fact the uhm databases that you have learned today can also
be accessed from home okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#119:1:A>
So that means you do not necessarily have to come back to the
library to use these resources okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#120:1:A>
So you can sit comfortably <.> a </.> comfortably at home uhm in
the middle of the night at three o'clock okay you can still log on to our
home page to do research okay to find information okay all right

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#121:1:A>
So how can you do that okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#122:1:A>
Now for all these resources okay that only available for Hong Kong
U staff and students only okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#123:1:A>
And uhm when you graduate by the time you graduate okay you might
be interested to know that in fact for selected resources they are also open
to Hong Kong U Alumni okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#124:1:A>
A very small selection uhm we  ' ll we actually give access to
alumni

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#125:1:A>
But that because we only allow uhm Hong Kong U staff and students
to access the resources

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#126:1:A>
We need authentication okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#127:1:A>
So we have to uh know that you are really a Hong Kong U student or
staff before we actually let you go in to our databases okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#128:1:A>
So how can we actually authenticate your access okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#129:1:A>
If you  ' re on campus okay using any of the network PC in this
library or in Computer Centre or in the office okay you  ' re safe because you
fall within the IP range of the university okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#130:1:A>
So <.> yo </.> we would let you in okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#131:1:A>
Or if you bring along your notebook okay you can hook up to the
Internet node okay or use the wireless LAN to access our network okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-056#132:1:A>
The same okay we will let you in to our databases <,> into our
databases okay right </I>
