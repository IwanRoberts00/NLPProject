Schoenberg , Berg and Webern <del> <.> wa </.> </del> were the
Second Viennese School in the twentieth century .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#2:1>
Their main contribution is developed the twelve tones techique in
1920s to 1930s given the prepared way for serialism after the World Wars .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#3:1>
Schoenberg is the creator of twelve tones technique and his students
&dash &semi; Berg and Webern further developed it into their own style .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#4:1>
In this essay , I am going to discuss the innovation twelve tone
technique by Schoenberg first , and then mention the development of the
Schoenberg  ' s style by Berg and Webern . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-015#5:1>
Schoenberg  ' s &obrack; 1874-1951 &cbrack; process from the
chromatic , post-Wagnerian style of his earliest work , through the atonal
style of ` expressionist  '  period , finally innovated the twelve tones
technique in 1923 .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#6:1>
The Theory of twelve tone technique is arranging a series or row which
contain twelve tones or pitch classes in <del> any </del> random order ,
within an octave .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#7:1>
The row can use as forming melody , harmony and counterpoint in any
octave or rhythmic pattern .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#8:1>
Beside the original row , it can also arrange into its inversion ,
retrograde and retrograde inversion .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#9:1>
It is also transposed into any level .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#10:1>
So <del> variety </del> there are various possibilities to form a
composition .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#11:1>
<marginalia> See P.S. at the end of this essay </marginalia>

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#12:1>
Schoenberg  ' s work such as Fine Piano Pieces Op.23 , <del> <.> Sener
</.> </del> Serenade Op.24 , four string Quartets , Piano and violin
concertos and Variation for orchestra Op.31 are using the twelve tone
technique .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#13:1>
But sometimes are contrasing the idea of this style and some are
completely used the format .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#14:1>
For example , in Variation for Orchestra Op.31 , the row is <del>
break </del> broken into 3 motives in Score 1 .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#15:1>
These motives form the <?> <del> thematic material </del> </?> melody
or theme in the variation .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#16:1>
<del> try <?> both </?> and the <.> harmon </.> </del> It is firstly
announced by cello .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#17:1>
And the 3 motives are supported by harmonies in the inverted row up a
maj . 6th . ie . Po-4 motif is supported by Io-4 harmony and P5-8 is
supported by I5-8 chord and so on .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#18:1>
Then the melody is varied in the form of Retrograde Inversion and
harmony is <del> <?> supportation </?> </del> supported by Retrograde form .
</p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-015#19:1>
<del> Schoenberg also used a </del> The aim of creating
twelve-tone series is making a coherent or unity in the form of composition
with the twelve pitches in scale .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#20:1>
All the notes are equally important .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#21:1>
It also retain the use of traditional instrument for composition
rather than the sprench stima in his expressionism .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#22:1>
Also it <unclear  <del> > 2-words </del> </unc> continue the 12
notes in scale for without forming a tonality .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#23:1>
On the other hand , <del> the </del> tonality lack a unity to form a
piece .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#24:1>
So <del> he </del> Schoenberg thought that twelve-tone technique is a
good style that can dominate the music world over 100 years .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#25:1>
&obrack; But of course , it is not the real thing ! &cbrack; </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-015#26:1>
Beside Schoenberg also used traditional or old form .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#27:1>
For example , Variation 2 in Op.31 is an antiphone and Variation 2 is
contrapuntal

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#28:1>
a cannon is formed between violin and oboe in inversion .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#29:1>
Later it also form a passacaglia .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#30:1>
In Suite for Piano Op.28 , He fitted the piece as Gavotte , <del> <.>
Mun </.> </del> Munett , <del> <.> Mus </.> </del> Gigne and Intermezzo .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#31:1>
They are come from the Banofre Suite form .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#32:1>
In Serenade Op.4 , the row is applied of isorhythm that origin from
Medieval motet . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-015#33:1>
In 1904 , Berg and Webern followed this style of Schoenberg and
dominate <del> the </del> to compose 12-tone music . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-015#34:1>
Berg &obrack; 1883-1935 &cbrack; freely used twelve tone
technique and allow it to form tonal element .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#35:1>
His works contain a warm feeling of Romantic style .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#36:1>
Such as violin concerto , Lyric Suite and <del> 2 </del> two operas:
Wozzeck and Ludu .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#37:1>
He emphasised on the constructional principles of thematic unity .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#38:1>
So thematic material is the main source to develop his composition .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#39:1>
Thus , his composition <del> are </del> are mostly in large-scale
length .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#40:1>
For example , in his violin concerto , the solo violin open in fifth
intervals at 1-7 bars which is a 4 open strings and sounded as <-> tunning
</-> <+> <?> tuning </?> </+> the string .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#41:1>
&obrack; See Score 2 &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#42:1>
Then the theme in original 12-tone now is annouced in b.15 in
succession of major and minor 3rd intervals with <del> a </del> few
whole-tone at the ends .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#43:1>
That tonal triad also <del> for </del> us <del> as </del> in his
chord progression and harmony .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#44:1>
&obrack; See Score 3 &cbrack; </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-015#45:1>
Like Schoenberg , he adopted the use of classical form .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#46:1>
The 1st movement of violin concerto is a Sonata form .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#47:1>
Beside , he <del> also </del> used Austrian and <del> Germany </del>
German element .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#48:1>
For example in the Allegretto tempo of the violin concerto , he use
Viennese Waltz and Austrian folk element .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#49:1>
In the Adagio of the Second movement , <del> he </del> the ending row
link to the harmonization of a Bach  ' s Chorale piece that Bach harmonized the
hymn .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#50:1>
It is enough in Cantata
#60

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#51:1>
<del> &obrack; See Score 4 &cbrack; </del> </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-015#52:1>
However , Webern against the use of tonal theme or thematic
materials to form a composition .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#53:1>
He ignored the tonal triadic but <.> <del> per </del> </.> prefer to
use unresolved 7th and 9th chords .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#54:1>
His contribution is divided his row into small unity space it with
rest and then played by different instruments .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#55:1>
<del> It is a influence </del> Therefore , all the pitch are in
individual manner and also produce a contrasting or blending timbre in
special sounding effect .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#56:1>
He draw much attention to produce special effect in instruments .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#57:1>
For example pizzicato , arco , harmonies , arco , muting , trendo ,
forte <del> versus </del> against pianissimo &semi; ritardanzo follow with a
tempo &semi; homophonic against contrapuntal texture &semi; contrasting tempo
and mood place <del> <unc> 1-character </unc> </del> different
sections or movements .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#58:1>
Those of the works contain these element are , for instance , Three
Songs for Soprano , E clarinet and <-> saxphone </-> <+> saxophone </+>
&semi; Symphony Op.21 &semi; Concerto for nine instruments and so on . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-015#59:1>
As same as Schoenberg , Webern use much contrapuntal texture ,
counterpoint and cannon to develop his tone row .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#60:1>
In Symphony Op.21 , the 2nd half of the tone row is retrogade of the
1st .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#61:1>
And the entire retrograde row is <del> the </del> a duplication of
the original row .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#62:1>
<del> The </del> So a mirror image is form between two half of the
row .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#63:1>
&obrack; See Score 4 &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#64:1>
The original row <del> first </del> divided into individual pitch or
2 to 3 pitches announced by different combination of instruments . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#65:1>
<O> diagram-showing-instrument-combinations </O>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-015#66:1>
From the above shceme , <del> we <.> s </.> </del> it is seen
that Horn I and Horn II form a cannon in contrary motion .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#67:1>
So as clarinet and bass <.> <del> <.> cal </.> </del> </.> clarinet .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#68:1>
In Quartet Op.22 , each pitch contain different dynamic marking .
</p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-015#69:1>
This kind of order systematic <del> <unc> 1-word </unc>
</del> style is highly concentrated the work .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#70:1>
So most of Webern  ' s work are dense and short in duration

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#71:1>
&obrack; His Symphony only last for <del> a </del> c.20 minutes
&cbrack; Beside , the <del> symmetric </del> symmetry and stability of
forming the row is a kind of <.> <?> <del> In </del> </?> </.> classical
style . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-015#72:1>
In conclusion , Berg and Webern widely <.> <del> dil </del> </.>
developed the Schoenberg  ' s twelve tone techniques .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#73:1>
The fore are in the style of Romanticism and the other in classic .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#74:1>
The further extend the possible variety in 12-tone technique which
later influence the serialism after 1945 , So the serialism is not <del> a
</del> seried in pitch but also duration , intensity , timbre....etc . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-015#75:1>
P.S . All the twelve tone are individual and equal important .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#76:1>
They have no <del> <unc> 2-characters </unc> </del>
relationship between each other , So Schoenberg avoid using tonal triad .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#77:1>
Beside , <del> before start the row again </del> composer had to
finish the entire row pitch before start another again . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#78:1>
&obrack &semi; Discuss the development of Twentieth Century British
Opera &cbrack &semi; </h>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-015#79:1>
The revival of British Opera in Twentieth Century is a special
event to the musical world .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#80:1>
Since the central Europe contain a long tradition of operatic music
from 16th century to the end of the Era .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#81:1>
But British Opera are much popular in this century .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#82:1>
The reasons of this <-> occassion </-> <+> occasion </+> <del> has
many </del> have the following points . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#83:1>
i &cbrack; There has no great operatic composer after Purcell and no
one inherited Purcell  ' s treasures throughout the last two decades.

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#84:1>
ii &cbrack; Most of the opera are come from outsider .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#85:1>
Although Handel wrote a lot of operatic work in England , all are in
the <del> style of </del> Italian style.

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#86:1>
iii &cbrack; The unfavourable situation of England made a gap for
communication to the central Europe , so popular music <del> are </del> <del>
spreat </del> spread <del> as </del> slowly into England.

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#87:1>
iv &cbrack; English is not a international language in that period .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#88:1>
Most of the opera are sung in Italian and German , Some in French .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#89:1>
Beside , the strong accent and articulation of English word is not
<del> favoured </del> favourable to the foreign people . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-015#90:1>
However , in this century , <del> the </del> after the industrial
revolution and <?> conqueror </?> of United Kingdom , <del> the </del>
English language become the international language in the world .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#91:1>
Many sophisticated machine build up for <del> communication </del>
world-wide communication .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#92:1>
So British people absorbed many foreign culture . <del> <unc>
2-words </unc> </del>

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#93:1>
In the early twentieth century , the pre-renaissance English composer
such as Vaughan William , Bax , <del> Hoslt </del> Holst , <del> Watn </del>
Walton and Delius...etc . <.> <del> ab </del> </.> learned much foreign music
, with <?> contrasting </?> national folk element and rework of old style
music , they develop a national style of music .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#94:1>
Later in 1945 , Benjamin Britten <-> composer </-> <+> composed </+>
Peter Grimes which evoked the attention to the whole word .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#95:1>
<del> In 19 </del> Between 1945-75 , British composer composed over
150 operas . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-015#96:1>
Of course , the main reason for this rebirth is Britten and his
followers produce a combination of national style , 20th century technique
and classical <del> <unc> 3-characters </unc> </del> tradition
element in his opera .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#97:1>
On the other hand , the central Europe get rid of the <?> diatonic
</?> tonality in the form of atonality , <-> advant-gard </-> <+> avant garde
</+> , sprench-stima in <-> expresstionism </-> <+> expressionism </+> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#98:1>
Since opera is a tonal <unc> <del> 1-character </del> </unc>
music , from the development of major and minor tonality in Monteverdi  ' s
opera to the late 19th century , opera is tonal , the destroy of tonality in
this century can not <-> <?> maintance </?> </-> <+> <?> maintain </?> </+>
the existence of operatic music .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#99:1>
But British Opera emphasise the point of tonality .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#100:1>
Their opera are tonal , so audience are much more accepted . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-015#101:1>
In the following paragraph , I will mention <del> three </del>
the great British operatic composer in this century .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#102:1>
<del> They are </del> Britten and <?> small touch </?> to Tippett
and Maxwell Davies . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-015#103:1>
Britten &obrack; 1913-76 &cbrack; became a famous operatic
composer after the performance of Peter Grimes .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#104:1>
Indeed , he wrote a lot of different opera .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#105:1>
Full-scale opera are Peter Grimes &semi; A mid Summer Marriage
&semi; Billy Budd &semi; Gloriana and Death in Venice .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#106:1>
Because of the <-> encomy </-> <+> economy </+> decline after the
world war , many operatic house are fell down , but in 1947 , a English
operatic group developed , Britten then wrote a few chamber opera such as The
Turn of Screws , Albert Herring &semi; The little Sweep .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#107:1>
He also wrote church opera .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#108:1>
They are partly worship and partly operatic that intend to performed
in church .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#109:1>
For example , The Prodigal Son , The Burning of Fiery Furnace and
Curlew River .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#110:1>
He also wrote ballet , Ballad opera , children opera and television
opera . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-015#111:1>
Britten  ' s opera contain diversify style which is influence by
Mahler  ' s symphony .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#112:1>
<del> He emphasised much on operatic setting </del> The following
points contain his diversification in terms of operatic setting &semi; aria ,
recitative and <-> choruss </-> <+> chorus </+> &semi; harmony &semi;
structure &semi; and orchestration . </p>
<p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#113:1>
1.Operatic Setting </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#114:1>
Britten adopted English <-> poam </-> <+> poem </+> and literatures
in his operatic .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#115:1>
Peter Grimes is come from George <-> Clabe  ' s </-> <+> Crabbe  ' s </+> <-> poam </-> <+> poem
</+> &ldquo; The Borough &rdquo; and The Turn of Screw is come from Henry
James  '  novella .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#116:1>
A mid-Summer night Dream is from <-> Shakephere  ' s </-> <+>
Shakespeare  ' s </+> drama . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-015#117:1>
<del> It <.> thi </.> </del> In <del> this setting </del> all
<del> his </del> opera , Britten wanted to reflect the realistic life of a
human being by the style of Naturalism .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#118:1>
In Peter Grimes , he is a fisherman that <del> had a <unc>
1-word </unc> </del> implied individual against the social world .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#119:1>
&obrack; Just reflected his life , a homosexual behaviour against
the social Scandal &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#120:1>
In Owen Wingrave , <del> he present </del> the theme is war that
reflected his hatred of <del> war in <.> wo </.> </del> World War .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#121:1>
But he also use supernatural element in A Midsummer Night Dream and
The Turns of Screw which is a <?> evil </?> story . </p>
<p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#122:1>
2.Aria , recitative and chorus </h> <del> Britten  ' s aria and
recitative are <?> hard </?> to recognised .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#123:1>
Beside , the recitative are in unnatural </del> Britten emphasised
much on word and music

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#124:1>
He think that word can produce dramatic effect in music .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#125:1>
So his aria &ampersand; recitative present in natural and unnatural
manner which follow the human speech .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#126:1>
For example , the prologue is a <del> <.> mol </.> </del> monologue
announced by Sawaller in speech rhythm .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#127:1>
Then Peter Grimes  '  Recitative follow in leap intervals and <del>
<.> comple </.> </del> irregular rhythm .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#128:1>
In <del> the </del> Act II , after Ellen  ' s <?> short aria </?> ,
she sing in leap intervals and said to Grimes <quote> &ldquo; Shall we not to
go to church in Sunday <?> Mornday </?> &ldquo; </quote> in parlando level .
&obrack; Score 5 &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#129:1>
Therefore , his recitative and aria are hard to recognized . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-015#130:1>
Beside the choruses produce a intensity and personality in the
opera

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#131:1>
It also involve the dramatic effect .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#132:1>
This is the different of Britten  ' s opera to classical opera .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#133:1>
<del> In the </del> After the Sea interlude  ' s chorus sing the
melody to reflect the activities in fishing port .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#134:1>
In Act II , they tightly sound that guess for the coming tide and at
the end of the Act III , they <del> cries </del> cry for Peter Grimes time
and again in order to find his way . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-015#135:1>
Also , Britten made word painting in the opera as same as
Purcell . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-015#136:1>
For example in Act II , Boles drunk a lot and sang <del> the
</del> melody in leap intervals and <?> unturning </?> sounds .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#137:1>
And then Grimes follow with his recitative with accented quaver
emphasis the word <mention> deep </mention>

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#138:1>
&obrack; See Score 6 &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#139:1>
Usually , Britten use four melodies to develop his thematic <.>
<del> melod </del> </.> materials , and many melody are come from <?>
material </?> such as Sea Interlude . </p>
<p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#140:1>
3.Harmony </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#141:1>
Britten  ' s harmony are mainly in diatonic tonality with some
chromaticism .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#142:1>
Beside , he applied <del> tone </del> tone-row in The Turn of Screw
, A Mid Summer Night Dream and Death of Venice .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#143:1>
But he treat it as tonal rather than serial .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#144:1>
For example , The tone row of The Turn of Screw is in Score 7 .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#145:1>
The perfect fifth intervals between pitch form a basis for tonic ,
dominant and <?> subdominant </?> in his opera . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-015#146:1>
In Peter Grimes , before the coming Act I , Ellen sings in E
major while Peter Grimes sings in A ,

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#147:1>
this is the use of bitonality .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#148:1>
Then Later , they make a consensus that end in E major . </p>
<p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#149:1>
4.Structure </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#150:1>
Unfamiliar to the classical operatic form .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#151:1>
There is no overture in Britten  ' s opera .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#152:1>
But he divided the scene <?> one </?> Act by numerous interlude .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#153:1>
In Peter Grimes there are six interludes .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#154:1>
For example the Sea interlude <del> in Act </del> played in the
beginning <del> of <unc> 1-character </unc> </del> and End of Act I .

<ICE-HK:W1A-015#155:1>
<del> <.> L </.> </del> Finally at the end of Act III , it repeat
again .

</del> &cbrack; .

while <del> James </del> Jack and Bella are the natural human being
and their <?> love </?> are straight forward .

psychology of Jung in which the visionary side stand for human darkness and

and expression method </p>
