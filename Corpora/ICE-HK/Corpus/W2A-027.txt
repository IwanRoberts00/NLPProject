<ICE-HK:W2A-027#3:1>
The emergency management of poisoning is important in reducing the
risk of mortality and morbidity in poisoned patients .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#4:1>
This article reviews the Hong Kong system of prehospital and emergency
care of poisoning , with reference to recent advances in this field .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#5:1>
Administrating activated charcoal is recommended for the
gastro-intestinal decontamination of most poisons , unless doing do is
contra-indicated .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#6:1>
Gastric lavage should be considered only in life-threatening cases of
poisoning that present within the first hour .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#7:1>
Newer antidotes that are available in Hong Kong accident and emergency
departments include hydroxocobalamin , stonefish and snake antevenenes ,
digoxin-specific antibodies , esmolol hydrochloride , and octreotide .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#8:1>
The  ' golden hour ' concept of gastro-intestinal demonstration is
advocated and ways to ensure that decontamination is performed within the  ' golden
hour ' are suggested . </bold> </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#9:1>
Introduction </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-027#10:1>
Poisoning is a somewhat neglected area in clinical medicine in
Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#11:1>
It is not subspecialty in most clinical units and the standard of
managing poisoned patients is highly variable .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#12:1>
With the shift of emphasis in the management of poisoning from
in-patient care to early decontamination and initial stabilisation ,
emergency physicians are taking a more active role in the care of poisoned
patients .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#13:1>
In this article , the emergency management of poisoned patients in
Hong Kong is reviewed , with reference to recent updates in the literature
and the different practices elsewhere . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#14:1>
Prehospital management </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-027#15:1>
The emergency management of poisoning starts from the scene of
the event , where early induction of vomiting can remove a significant
portion of the ingested poison .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#16:1>
It is not clear , however , whether early or late induction of
vomiting influences the outcome .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#17:1>
In countries where poisons information centres are accessible to the
public , people are advised to keep some ipecacuanha &obrack;  Ipecac Syrup USP or
Paediatric Ipecacuanha Emetic Mixture BP &cbrack; at home .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#18:1>
If poisons are ingested , the poisons information centre can be
called for advice prior to inducing vomiting with ipecacuanha .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#19:1>
This practice has been shown to reduce visits to emergency
departments for paediatric <sp> 1 </sp> and other poisonings .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#20:1>
In Hong Kong , The Drug and Poisons Information Bureau at the Prince
of Wales Hospital provides a 24-hour advice service that is staffed by the
Division of Clinical Pharmacology of The Chinese University of Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#21:1>
Because of the limited resources , however , it mainly takes calls
from health care workers and is generally not accessible to the public. <sp>
2 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-027#22:1>
When the toxic agent ingested is not known , it is not available
to induce vomiting by the gag reflex or with chemical agents .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#23:1>
If the toxic agent is a corrosive , vomiting will inflict a second
insult on the upper gastro-intestinal tract .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#24:1>
Furthermore , aspiration of vomit in patients with decreasing
consciousness can be fatal .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#25:1>
The most useful and simple advice for the on-site treatment of
poisoning is as follows: &obrack;  1 &cbrack; to irrigate external chemical burns with plenty
of water; &obrack;  2 &cbrack; if corrosive have been ingested , to drink a cup of water or
milk , which may dilute the corrosive and reduce tissue damage , provided the
patient can protect his or her own airway; and &obrack;  3 &cbrack; to immerse stings from
stonefish or other deep-sea fish in hot water &obrack;  at 45°C &cbrack; for 30 to 60 minutes
to help inactivate the toxin and decrease the severity of the symptoms. <sp>
3 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-027#26:1>
When a poisoned patient calls an ambulance , the ambulance
personnel should have a chance to administer early decontamination and
antidotal treatment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#27:1>
Studies have been done on the prehospital use of activated charcoal ,
naloxone , and hypertonic glucose &obrack;  dextrose monohydrate &cbrack; by paramedics , and
they have yielded encouraging results. <sp> 4-7 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#28:1>
Crockett el al <sp> 4 </sp> in their pilot study of the prehospital
use of activated charcoal , showed that the time for activated charcoal
administration could be when it is given in hospital .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#29:1>
Hoffman el al <sp> 6 </sp> demonstrated that it is safe to use
naloxone empirically in paramedic treatment protocols for patients with an
acute loss of consciousness . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-027#30:1>
In Hong Kong , emergency medical assistants II &obrack;  EMA II &cbrack; have
been trained to give antidotes of oxygen for carbon monoxide poisoning ,
glucose 10&percent; for hypoglycaemia , and naloxone for narcotic overdose .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#31:1>
The majority of ambulance personnel , however , are not trained to
the level of EMA II , and only 25&percent; of the emergency calls are attended by EMA
II .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#32:1>
With regard to the optimal position for transporting a poisoned
patient to the hospital , Vance et al <sp> 8 </sp> have recommend the left
lateral decubitus position , because this position is associated with the
lowest initial absorption of toxin .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#33:1>
This position also offers advantages in preventing aspiration and
enhancing oropharyngeal drainage . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#34:1>
Management of poisoning in the accident and emergency department
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-027#35:1>
After arriving at the accident and emergency &obrack;  A &ampersand; E &cbrack; department
, all significantly poisoned patients are triaged as being in a critical or
emergency condition, <sp> 9 </sp> depending on whether they are unstable or
not .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#36:1>
This practice will ensure that the patients can be seen almost
immediately for stabilisation and consideration of early gut decontamination .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#37:1>
The mainstay of the management of poisoning is supportive - that is ,
care of the airway and the maintenance of breathing and the blood circulation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#38:1>
Toxic symptoms such as convulsion and arrhythmia should be watched
for , as their onset can be quite sudden .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#39:1>
If the patient  ' s history and the results of the physical examination
support toxic ingestion , gut decontamination should be considered . </p> <h>
<bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#40:1>
Gut decontamination </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-027#41:1>
Much controversy remains regarding the roles of gastric lavage,
<sp> 10-13 </sp> emesis, <sp> 14-17 </sp> activated charcoal, <sp> 18,19
</sp> whole-bowel irrigation, <sp> 20,21 </sp> and the use of cathartics <sp>
22 </sp> in decontaminating the gut .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#42:1>
In view of this , the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology and
European Association of Poison Centres and Clinical Toxicologists have
published position statements of various gut decontamination methods. <sp> 23
</sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#43:1>
These position statements are systemically developed clinical
guidelines based on high-quality research evidence , and are summarised in
Table 1 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#44:1>
They are well accepted by the rest of the world , being endorsed by
the Canadian Association of Poison Control Centers and the American Board of
Applied Toxicology . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-027#45:1>
In Hong Kong , gastric lavage is still commonly practiced ,
sometimes for even minor poisoning , and it has been associated with a number
of fatalities. <sp> 24 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#46:1>
It is based on these position statements and other literature that
the Coordinating Committee in A &ampersand; E Service of Hong Kong developed their
protocol on gastro-intestinal decontamination. <sp> 25 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#47:1>
This protocol advocates activated charcoal as the treatment of choice
for most poisons , except substances such as metals , alcohol , cyanide ,
acids , and alkalis , which are not adsorbable by charcoal .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#48:1>
Although charcoal should be given within 1 hour of ingestion of the
poison , the protocol recommends giving the drug within the first few hours
in <O> Table </O> views of its safety profile and ease of administration .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#49:1>
As there have been case reports of fatal aspiration . however , an
unprotected airway is a contra-indication for the administration of activated
charcoal .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#50:1>
On the other hand , the use of gastric lavage is now limited to
life-threatening ingestions that present within 1 hour .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#51:1>
Even then , clinical benefit has not been confirmed in controlled
studies. <sp> 23 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#52:1>
To reduce the morbidity of the procedure , certain contra-indications
should be noted; they include an unprotected airway , an uncooperative
patient , and the ingestion of corrosives or petroleum products .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#53:1>
Furthermore , the proper method of gastric lavage is important in
minimising the risk of pulmonary aspiration and oesophageal rupture &obrack;  Box &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#54:1>
The routine use of ipecacuanha or cathartics in the A &ampersand; E department
is not recommended .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#55:1>
Whole toxic irrigation can be considered for potentially toxic
ingestion of sustained-release or enteric coated drugs . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#56:1>
New antibodies </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-027#57:1>
In certain poisoning , the early use of a specific antidote can
reduce the risk of mortality and morbidity in the patient .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#58:1>
Some antidotes , however , are very expensive and have adverse side
effects .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#59:1>
Hence , these antidotes should be used in only severe poisonings and
according to strict indications , when the benefits outweigh the adverse
effects and costs .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#60:1>
Useful antidotes that are available in public hospitals in Hong Kong
are listed in Table 2 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#61:1>
Only the newly introduced ones are discussed below . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#62:1>
<it> Hydroxocobalamin </it> </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-027#63:1>
Hydroxocobalamin was introduced to the hospitals of the Hospital
Authority after an incidence of cyanide poisoning , when hypotension
developed in one of the patients; conventional antidote treatment with sodium
nitrite was thus contra-indicated. <sp> 26 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#64:1>
Hydroxocobalamin is the synthesic form of vitamin B <sb> 12 </sb> ,
which works by sequestering cyanide from plasma-cyanide to give non-toxic
cyanocobalamin .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#65:1>
The adverse effects are minimal - namely , brown coloration of body
fluids , nausea , and vomiting .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#66:1>
Hypertension and muscle spasms may also be observed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#67:1>
The initial dose is 5 g of reconstituted solution given over 30
minutes Subsequent doses , if the severity of poisoning so indicates , should
be given more slowly over 2 hours . </p> <h> <it> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#68:1>
Stonefish antevenene </it> </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-027#69:1>
The stonefish is a coral fish that has been venom glands on its
13 dorsal spines .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#70:1>
As stonefish are becoming increasingly popular in seafood restaurants
, poisonous stingings of kitchen staff and fishmongers are increasingly
common .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#71:1>
The venom is one of the most potent toxins known and causes immediate
intense pain , numbness , and swelling .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#72:1>
Systemic effects include delirium , convulsion , hypotension ,
arrhythmia , and pulmonary oedema .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#73:1>
Emergency management includes immersion in hot water &obrack;  at 45°C &cbrack; to
inactivate the toxin and the administration of potent alangesics .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#74:1>
Stonefish antevenene , recently stocked in the A &ampersand; E department of
most hospitals , is indicated of pain and oedema is severe or when there is
systemic manifestation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#75:1>
One ampoule of 2000 units should be given for the injury from one or
two spines .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#76:1>
Because the antevenene is prepare from horse serum , anaphylaxis and
delayed serum sickness may develop . </p> <h> <it> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#77:1>
Snake antevenenes </bold> </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-027#78:1>
Some snake antevenenes are available in Hong Kong and the
Coordinating Committee in A &ampersand; E Services has published a protocol for the
management of snake bites, <sp> 27 </sp> which includes the indications and
precautions for the proper use of antivenenes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#79:1>
The majority of snake bites in Hong Kong are by bamboo snakes &obrack;  <it>
Trimeresurus albolabris </it>  &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#80:1>
Most of these bites are mild and do not require antevenene. <sp> 28
</sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#81:1>
However , when antevenene is used , precautions need to be taken
regarding anaphylaxis and serum sickness .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#82:1>
There is evidence that monovalent antevenene is better than
polyvalent antevenene. <sp> 29 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#83:1>
Furthermore , imported antevenenes that are specific for species
overseas may not as good as those manufactured locally , due to venom
variability within individual species. <sp> 29 </sp> </p> <h> <it> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#84:1>
Digoxin-specific antibodies </bold> </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-027#85:1>
Digoxin-specific antigen-binding fragments are indicated for
life-threatening arrhythmia or hyperkalaemia caused by intoxication by
cardiac glycosides .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#86:1>
Improvement of symptoms occurs within 10 minutes of injection and
peaks at 4 hours .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#87:1>
Because the antibodies are produced in sheep , patients need to be
monitored for anaphylaxis and serum sickness . </p> <h> <it> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#88:1>
Esmolol hydrochloride </bold> </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-027#89:1>
Esmolo hydrochloride is a short-acting cardioselective
beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug that has no sympatho-minetic activity .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#90:1>
This drug is useful for controlling hypertension and tachyarrhythmia
due to excessive sympathominetic activity following an overdose of a central
nervous system stimulant .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#91:1>
Given in an infusion , esmolol is better than propranolol , because
its half-life of only 9 minutes allows rapid titration of the therapeutic
effect .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#92:1>
Contra-indications include hypotension , bradycardia , and a history
of asthma . </p> <h> <it> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#93:1>
Octreotide </bold> </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-027#94:1>
Octreotide is a synthetic polypeptide that antagonises pancreatic
insulin .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#95:1>
It is indicated for the treatment of sulphonylurea-induced
hypolycaemia if the blood glucose level cannot be maintained by intravenously
infusing glucose 10&percent; . </p> <h> <it> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#96:1>
New antibodies that are not available in Hong Kong </bold> </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-027#97:1>
Botulism or botulinum antitioxin was developed from
equine-derived antibodies against the toxin of <it> Clostridium botulinum
</it> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#98:1>
It is used to treat clinical botulism to prevent the progression of
neurological complications . Succimer &obrack;  2,3-dimercaptousccinic acid &cbrack; is a
chelating agent that is used to treat lead , mercury , and arsenic poisoning;
it is the water-soluble analogues of dimercaprol and can be taken orally .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#99:1>
Fomepizole &obrack;  4-methypyrazole &cbrack; is a potent competitive inhibitor of
alcohol dehydrogenase and prevents the formation of toxic metabolites
following methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning; it is preferred to ethanol
as an antidote because it does not cause sedation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#100:1>
Nalmefene and naltrexone are long-acting opioid antagonists that are
used to manage opioid dependence; they are more potent than naloxone but much
more expensive . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#101:1>
The  ' golden hour ' concept of gut decontamination </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-027#102:1>
In the treatment of trauma patients , there is the  ' golden hour'
concept, <sp> 30 </sp> whereby the first hour represents the best chance to
stabilise and treat potentially life-threatening injuries before the patient  ' s
condition deteriorates .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#103:1>
In the management of ingested poisons , a similar concept should
also be emplasised , after the first hour , the amount of poison removed from
the body is much decreased .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#104:1>
Medical personnel who care for poisoned patients should keep this
concept in mind - that is , to consider early decontamination after the
overdose , perfectly within the first hour .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#105:1>
The poisons information centre should extend its service to the
public by providing advice for emesis in indicated cases .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#106:1>
The administration of activated charcoal should be added to the list
of drug protocols for the use of EMA II , preferably in consultation with
emergency physicians via radio-communication .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#107:1>
After arriving at the emergency department , poisoned patients
should be given high priority .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#108:1>
With the aid of immediate computer access to a poison index at all A
& E departments , doctors can male an early decision about gut
decontamination .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#109:1>
This should reduce the time since ingestion and enable hut
decontamination to be done within the  ' golden hour ' . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#110:1>
Conclusion </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-027#111:1>
Emergency physicians should take a more active role in the
emergency management of poisoning , not only in the A &ampersand; E department , but
also in the prehospital setting , where early decontamination and antidote
treatment can be initiated if necessary .

<ICE-HK:W2A-027#112:1>
With the early use of appropriate gut decontamination methods ,
proper use of antidotes , and better supportive care , the risk of mortality
from poisoning will greatly decrease and most patients will return to society
with minimal disability . </p>
