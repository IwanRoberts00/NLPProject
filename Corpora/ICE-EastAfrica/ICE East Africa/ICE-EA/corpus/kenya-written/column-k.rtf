\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 I am not about to celebrate last week's exit of queue-voting; I do not think I will do that soon.
\par <#/>What I will do now is acknowledge the great service the President rendered Kenyans by persuading the Kanu delegates to scrap the hated }{\i\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>mlolongo}{\fs24\lang2057  because hated it was except by the few who <-/benefitted> from it.

\par <#/>In my view, the issue in Kenya's electoral process has not been whether or not it is the secret ballot or queue-voting. <#/>The bone of contention here is RIGGING.
\par <#/>It must be borne in mind from the very outset that the proponents of queue-voting (}{\i\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>mlolongoists}{\fs24\lang2057 ) vigorously argued that this method would el
iminate rigging. <#/>Of course, it did not, but that argument itself clearly was acknowledgement enough that there had been rigging in secret balloting to which we are reverting for Party nominations.
\par <#/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 <Ea/>mlolongoists}{\fs24\lang2057  also argued that queue-voting wou
ld be carried out in broad daylight, and therefore, nobody would rig the elections, but, as we all know, secret balloting is not carried out at night and the so-called daylight polls were rigged.

\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \lang2057\cgrid {<#/>What actually happened is that Ken
yans saw how elections could be blatantly and flagrantly rigged before their very eyes! <#/>A delegate at the two-day Kanu conference said that short queues produced the winners and the longer ones the losers!
\par <#/>The Minister for Health, Mr Mwai Kibaki, he of astute aloofness, was so staggered by the blatant abuse of the electoral process in the Kanu polls of 1988 that he snapped, "at least rigging has some intelligence!\rdblquote 
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang1031\cgrid {<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The people who rigged the secret ballot polls again rigged the so-called open-air
 polls or as Nandi <-/Ditrict> Kanu branch chairman, Mr Mark Too, called it, open-air democracy. <#/>There was no democracy in the queue polls in some areas; there was open-air <slang/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 democrazy}{\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>Of course, I had sworn never ever to stand in this thing called }{\i\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>mlolongo}{\fs24\lang2057 
, the fact that I queue at the bank, <-/Electricty> House and at the doctor's notwithstanding. <#/>I don't queue there to elect my parliamentary or civic representative, but because I do not want to be a public nuisance through bad mann
ers and disrespect for fellow Kenyans by jumping the queue.
\par <#/>But that queue-voting went last week is not reason enough that there will be no rigging. <#/>Who rigged the elections? <#/>We all know that the returning officers during elections are administ
ration officials and when Kenyans presented their views to the Kanu Review Committee, they said that future polls should be handled by an independent commission.
\par <#/>The popular view was that elections were rigged by the administration, but the District Co
mmissioners cannot have acted alone. <#/>During his contribution to the special Kanu delegates conference last week, Mr Wasike Ndombi, the MP for Lurambi, said that the DC's talked of telephone calls from above.
\par <#/>Where could above be? <#/>Your guess is as good as mine, but the committee rejected the demand for an independent commission to run the elections and insisted that the provincial administration be deployed for this exercise.
\par <#/>Like Thomas, I will touch the scars to believe, I will have to see it to believe. <#/>Yes, you have got it right, I am <-/skeptical>; I am apprehensive.

\par <#/>In this (mis)perception of power, he who has the power wields it!

 should be about the empowerment of the people; the election should be about the right of the people of Kenya to participate in their very governance; the people of Kenya should be consulted on every single idea that is bound to affect them (for better or

\par <#/>Election-riggers and rigging must go.
\par <#/>We hav
e had a situation where two or three Kanu stalwarts - such as Mr Mark Too and Mr Ezekiel Barng'etuny - have taken it upon themselves to choose leaders for Kenyans. <#/>The latter confessed to such a role in Nandi District in the rigged 1988 General Electi
on.
\par <#/>It is time for so-called power-brokers to go. <#/>And the run-up to the multi-party General Election is the beginning of the end of the era of power-brokers.
\par <#/>We have had leaders whose business it has been to saddle Kenyans with one sizzling controversy after another. <#/>Some have been stage-managed melodramas. <#/>The idea was always to divert attention from the burning issues of the day.
\par <#/>It is time to elect thinking and issues-oriented leaders.
\par <#/>We have had situations where legitimate di
ssent was criminalised and some Kanu hawks attempted to impose a uniformity of thought on Kenyans. <#/>These were men and women for whom the freedoms of thought, expression and assembly were to exist only in statute books safely gathering dust on forgotte
n shelves!
\par <#/>It is time for the rule of law. <#/>We have had a Parliament which specialised in peddling red herrings, never addressed reasonably and soberly any issues brought before it and made empty condemnation and vilification of all and sundry its }{
\i\fs24\lang2057 most important matters of national importance}{\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>We have had a Parliament which at no time wanted to show that it was capable of researched and reasoned debate; a House where a quorum was a rumour unless Ministers wanted to vote for a Government motion within the shortest time possible.
\par <#/>Let us have an assertive Parliament.
\par <#/>Kenyans have come to believe that it is their MPs who are supposed to, for example, <-/tarmack> their roads; that it is MPs who "bring development". <#/>But i
s that the way it should be in every material particular? <#/>Let me tell you something; some of us know the salaries of MPs.
\par <#/>Development is the work of the Government.
\par <#/>If there are certain areas of this country which are better developed - in term

\par <#/>In my view, the Presidential candidate who lays emphasis on the need to create a strong economy and shows how he intends to do this and one who invests the most premium in the unity and security of Kenyans, is the man or woman Kenyans should vote for.

\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Wonders will never cease, they will always increase.
\par <#/>The National Council of the Churches of Kenya (NCCK)-facilitated probe committee into the so-called ethnic clashes came o
ut with a report that implicated prominent people in Government, Kanu, Rift Valley-based politicians and the provincial administration.
\par <#/>It was roundly condemned by leaders of the political establishment as inciting the public against the Government, against Kanu and trying to isolate the Kalenjin.

\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The way I see it is that Kenyans are becoming a sick and sickening alcohol-swilling lot. <#/>They have glorified this social beverage and turned it into stuff for a riotous national pastime.
\par <#/>That is why I tended to agree with a committed beer-drinker w
ho said that if you want a revolution in Kenya very fast, ban beer- drinking and free sex. <#/>It is as if alcohol is the lubricant that oils social relationships and that, without it, society's cogs will grind to a halt. <#/>Of course, alcohol can be an 
acceptable lubricant to a point but not when it is treated as the main one.
\par <#/>The penetration of the alcohol culture into the lives of Kenyans is such that the phrase, "let us have one", meaning, "let us go and get drunk", rolls off tongues as easily as "
let us have a cup of tea". <#/>Of course, there are great differences in the composition of the two liquids because one has the tendency to play games with one's imagination while the other makes it steady.
\par <#/>Lots of times, a telephone conversation goes on like this on a Monday afternoon: "You're very lost ... Really? <#/>... I thought you had stopped drinking ... <#/><ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 kwani}{\fs24\lang2057 
 where do you swallow? <#/>... Oh, that joint? <#/>Me, I'm still faithful to the old place. <#/>It's a crawling distance from my 
house, you see. <#/>... Today? <#/>Of course, we can meet there ... <#/>No problem. <#/>I have a hundred and I'm sure you have two to return the hand ...\rdblquote 
\par <#/>That having been said, the two Kenyans will meet and have what will turn out to be an evening of 
many drowned bottles. <#/>Remember that is happening on a Monday and the following day is a Tuesday and not a public holiday. <#/>Remember also that nobody has even discovered a cure for hangovers and that when one is suffering from the over indulgence of
 the night before, the head tends to behave like a rock by resting lazily on the shoulders and being hostile to thinking.
\par <#/>The culture of "let's go and have one" is justified in all sorts of ways. <#/>There are those who, like the Latins, say, <foreign_>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 in vino veritas<foreign/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>That is, in wine there is truth or something related to that. <#/>Those who use that argument say that there is no better way of oiling a relationship than in an imbibing session where all hangups are banished by the intoxica
ting liquids. <#/>The tongue is loosened thus the mouth says what is in the heart. <#/>The only trouble in Kenya is that we have made that process of loosening tongues with wine too regular and by using too much alcohol for the purpose. <#/>For us, it is 
a never ending process.
\par <#/>For men, the guise of being responsible wealth hunters wherever it can be found, be it on rooftops or under the sea, comes in handy when justifying being in the bar and <-/overdrinking>. <#/>They posit that it is only in those pl
aces that they can make important contacts and therefore clinch mighty goals.
\par <#/>Thus you will hear a man tell his wife: "Do you imagine that I shall ever get a plot to build on if I sit in the house and drink tea with you? <#/>No, I can only get that plo
t if I meet my fellow men. <#/>My fellow men are normally found in bars and not in the church so swallow I must swallow.\rdblquote 
\par <#/>More often than not, there are no deals about plots but evenings of frenzied drinking and plots on how to keep women in their supposed place.
\par <#/>Fridays offer what is posed as the inescapable excuse for drinking beer with reckless abandon. <#/>The day is endearingly called "Members Day", that is, the day to drink beer by the barrel.
\par <#/>Come lunch hour on that day and meat is eaten as if there will be no goats tomorrow because, as they say, "you have to build <unknown/>gabions" ready for a major drink later in the evening. <#/>After office hours, all throats head for the bar.
\par <#/>With stomachs so fortified, those celebrants of the "M
embers Day" will compete to drink bars dry and then, as they nurse their hangovers the following day, they will happily narrate their exploits. <#/>They will do so because there is supposed to be heroism in trying to drink the entire brewery.
\par <#/>Thus you 
will meet a Kenyan, his bloodshot eyes bulging as if they are threatening to jump out of their sockets, his head veins looking as if they will burst any time and generally looking as if he is ready for the mortuary and he will proudly say: "Chief, I swall
owed last night. <#/>No, it was not last night. <#/>I mean until nearly  this morning. <#/>I swallowed beer and all its  children. <#/>First it was at Rienye's where we  started with a roast and beers.
\par <#/> "After harassing so many beers at that place I fel
t that my stomach was just getting full and nothing in my head was changing. <#/>So I moved to Ngop. <#/>There I decided to deal with the stuff from the land of Gorbachev, that is Vodka itself. <#/>I tell you, I must have swallowed what would knock out a 
tiger"
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
Another one who, perhaps, cannot hold his drink up to the end, will proudly talk about how he nearly killed himself. <#/>After a night of hard drinking, he will say: "I tell you, <ea/>bwana, last night I swallowed so much that I could not tell my
 nose from my leg. <#/>As a matter of fact, I don't know how I got home. <#/>I just found myself in bed and the car parked outside. <#/>It must have driven itself home because the last thing I remember is dancing near the jukebox.\rdblquote 
\par <#/>There are even those
 who admire other Kenyans who are said to have throats that can resist fire in the name of drinking. <#/>I have heard a Kenyan say this: "I tell you that Kenyan is tough. <#/>He can swallow a whole bottle of whiskey and still get home to his wife in one p
iece. <#/>I just don't know how he manages to be so tough. <#/>I wish I were like him!\rdblquote 
\par <#/>If you are known to be a beer-drinker and you excuse yourself too regularly from the bar orgies, friends start to think that you are a traitor who has betrayed the d
rinking brotherhood. <#/>Others will even say: "WM is sat on by his wife these days. <#/>He gives his wife all his money together with the payslip so that she can verify that he has not spent any. <#/>She is the one who controls what he spends. <#/>I real
ly don't know what has come over him.\rdblquote 
\par <#/>Perhaps this beer-swallowing culture has something to do with the structure of the whole society for we live in one that is pulling down the barriers of permissiveness. <#/>We are kind of engendering a society that
 believes in making merry all round little caring about the side effects of the "laughing gas" that we are using to make ourselves happy.
\par <#/>Kenyans are also making themselves too happy with alcohol because it is freely available. <#/>Go to the smallest t
own in the country and you will miss a butchery, a bed to rest your tired ribs on or a regular supply of soap but you will have enough beer to drink. <#/>Most rural towns have what can be identified as beer belts - a street dominated by bars.
\par <#/>In Nairobi, bars pop up everywhere in the residential estates as if it would be against the law not to let people get drunk.
\par <#/>At the same time, the reckless beer-drinking definitely has a lot to do with the fact that meaningful recreation facilities are lacking 
in community settlements. <#/>The drudgery of going home every evening, seeing the same people there and being tortured by a television station that is pain to the eyes and ears makes drinking a very attractive prospect.
\par <#/>Community social halls where pe
ople used to gather and watch television and theatre particularly in Nairobi's Eastlands no longer serve that purpose. <#/>At the same time, now that television is no longer novel and offers nothing really worth talking about and theatre is mistaken by th

\par <#/>That is so because tribalism in all its manifestations eats into the very fabric of society, saps its self-sustaining juices and leaves gangrenous rot - the last of the steps in the collapse of the management of the nation-state.
\par <#/>Let tribalism not be confused with ethnicity or the peculiarities of a person's coming f
rom a certain region in Kenya, speaking a specific language, eating specific foods, dressing in a manner peculiar to the tribe, observing taboos prescribed by the tribe and doing whatever else that pertains to the mores of his ethnic group.

utterances really are not the issue here.
\par <#/>They are only relevant in so far as such statements are being made while Kanu listens and says nothing. <#/>The secretary-general Mr Joseph Kamotho, has criticised the statements but not in his capacity as the p

\par <#/>Senior politicians - some of them known to wield substantial clout - have taken to making statements which are neither well-intentioned criticisms nor feasible solutions to the problems the l

\par <#/>But since you and I know that they are not, why is the authority which legitimises their positions of auth

 called for.
\par <#/>I need not remind you that people have been punished by the party after being found guilty of relatively minor offences. <#/>It does not reflect well on the party to leave itself open to accusations of double-standards, and that is why it s

 have seen the incident, but that does not mean it did not happen.
\par <#/>Since there is no plausible explanation for the animalistic behaviour of the guards, I can only guess that they felt the Minister simply did not wish for coverage - highly unlikely for

\par <#/>But the doctors and their s

\par <#/>Their selflessness is a bright spot in a continuum of grey and black, a brilliance one hopes will l

Sudan's leadership comes in for a barb this week for its apparent intention to pursue the military option in resolving the long-running conflict in southern Sudan. <#/>A reported string of victories against the seccessionist rebel group - Su

\par <#/>I would like to disabuse the General and his people of the notion that they can discoun
t the SPLA so easily. <#/>Any such thinking ignores the lessons of the history of this particular conflict, and of others elsewhere. <#/>The southern Sudan problem is more deep-rooted than Gen Bashir may believe.
\par <#/>It is not merely a question of the main
ly black, animist south rejecting the rule of the fair-skinned Arab-dominated Islamic north. <#/>It is a conflict which has to do with the development of a collective national identity, sharing out national resources as equitably as possible and respectin

\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Mwai Kibaki, that urbane, extremely competent technocrat and agile politician has become famous fo
r his unique contribution to Kenya's development and rare ability to come out on top of tribulations which would deflate lesser men. <#/>He is quite fearless too.
\par <#/>This week, he comes in for a bouquet for exposing , yet again, another admirable facet of his character, and one which is increasingly difficult to find in many local politicians - honesty.
\par <#/>Lately, there have been several press reports, extensively detailing the rot in which many of the local health institutions are mired in. <#/>The decre
pit New Nyanza General Hospital (also referred to as Russia Hospital) in Kisumu, was singled out for particular censure, in this instance by a write-up in the }{\i\fs24\lang2057 Kenya Times}{\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>In keeping with the tradition that all of you readers should be familiar with by
 now, a politician, Mr Miruka Owuor, who represents the Nyando constituency, came out strongly against the newspaper which he accused of "alarmist reporting" about the hospital. <#/>But in this, as in almost every other instance that the media has been cr
iticised of misreporting, the Press was right.
\par <#/>And we have Mr Kibaki to thank for this. <#/>Following the report, he toured health facilities in Nyanza Province - including the hospital in question - and verified that the media reports were factual. <#/>He said as much.
\par <#/>It was true that the hospital was a shambles, it was true that it was teetering on the brink of collapse, true that its mortuary was in a pathetic state. <#/>Almost every department and facility within the institution was wanting in s
ome way. <#/>That is what had been said in the media and Mr Kibaki verified it.
\par <#/>His action is commendable for its own sake. <#/>It is also commendable because it brings into extremely sharp focus the more common, dishonest, bumbling attempts at decepti
on and cover-up which we have learnt to expect from most of our politicians. <#/>Had Mr Kibaki not gone to Kisumu, Mr Owuor's misleading statement would most probably have won the day.
\par <#/>Regrettably for the health of local politics and the development of
 this country, half-truths and flagrant distortions of truth have virtually been institutionalised. <#/>Politicians will deny the existence of a disease epidemic, the shortage of an essential commodity, the incompetence of a public institution, etc, when 
such an issue is beyond debate.
\par <#/>By doing this, they have abetted crime, sabotaged efforts to improve the delivery of services through criticism, and misled multitudes of credulous <ea/>wananchi who take most of what the leaders say as gospel truth. <#/>
It has become so prevalent that it has, counter-productively, bred a dangerous cynicism in those who can see through the lies. <#/>It is a cynicism which makes them disbelieve the politicians even on the rare times that they may be telling the truth.

\par <#/>I
t is futile to remind them at this point that honesty and justice are inseparable, that they cheat themselves more by misleading the public, and that at this point in time, many people may listen to what they say but only a handful believe. <#/>Mr Kibaki 
is clearly aware of this and he gets a bouquet for not trying to insist that black is white, just because he wants it to be white.
\par <#/>Different view over the sack
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Another bouquet goes to the handful of people who, publicly or privately, have raised thi
s question: To what extent have workers in the private or public sector been kicked out of their jobs for reasons other than incompetence or gross insubordination? <#/>In other words, how often has the threat, or the act of sacking been precipitated by re
asons other than the purely professional?
\par <#/>I do not <-/>not know, but I think it is a significant question particularly at this time when the debate on the efficiency and effectiveness of parastatal and other public institutions is raging.
\par <#/>Often, if 
not all the time, the public has assumed that when an individual is sacked, particularly from a responsible position, it is because he did not perform competently. <#/>He either made an indefensible management decision, stole money or did something else e
qually unacceptable}{\v\fs24\lang2057 . }{\fs24\lang2057 <X}{\v\fs24\lang2057 _>}{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 But wait a minute. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
It can be argued, fairly convincingly, that extraneous issues - politics, jealousy, personal differences, rivalry and pique - do play a significant part in such matters.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Numerous scenarios can be drawn up. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
An officer refuses to approve a deal in which another powerful party is interested in; a senior manager makes a right decision but one which is not in the interest of another "tough guy"; an officer refuses to grant a favour (usually illegally sou
ght) to one who is influential, etc.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The possibility has been raised that in extreme cases, being too efficient can be held against one, particularly if such efficiency might lead to the unearthing of records which detail dubious transactions. }{\v <#/>}{
\v\fs24\lang2057 All these and more, I am told, are possible.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Because of the serious possibilities they raise, and because decisions to sack will continue to be made, I leave it to you reader to mull over the matter. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057

not acknowledging job applications which they (employers) have invited in the first place.

\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 If a number of legislators are to be believed, Kenya is sliding fast into the law of the jungle where highway men are free to rob and murder citizens without the fear of ever being apprehended.
\par <#/>This is not an overstatement as banditry in North Eastern, Coast and Rift Valley provinces would testify.
\par <#/>Legislators Philip Godana (Moyale) and Ali Bujra (Lamu West) spoke this week as if bandits had seized the initiative from the security forces.
\par <#/>They felt that most of the insecurity pro
blems facing the country were self inflicted since the Government had kept the Somali-Kenya border porous, thereby allowing armed soldiers, spies and all types of <-/desperados> from Somalia to find sanctuary here.
\par <#/>Mr Godana said that on Wednesday alone, seven Boran women were murdered in cold blood by some Somali refugees from a camp near Moyale town.
\par <#/>He said the refugees had heavily outnumbered his constituents and had taken over all social facilities, including grazing lands.
\par <#/>Mr Bujra had a similar story to tell about Witu town which had been ransacked on three occasions by heavily armed bandits.
\par <#/>An Assistant Minister for Livestock, Mr Peter Nang'ole told the House how more than 600 heavily armed rustlers dressed in military uniform raided
 a location in Kacheliba and overpowered Administration Policemen based at Kiwawa location before disappearing with more than 1,300 head of cattle.
\par <#/>Apart from security issues, nothing else was inspiring or noteworthy about Parliamentary debates this week.
\par <#/>Even Question Time which is normally the liveliest period during a sitting appears to have degenerated into a routine affair where nonsense is sometimes given in response to questions of considerable importance to the public.
\par <#/>The lethargy is not merely confined to Ministers, a number of whom excel in giving un-researched answers, but also to some MPs who submit controversial questions but for some reasons }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>idiom}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 
fail to come to the House to ask them after they are listed in the Order Paper.
\par <#/>Some of the questions listed this week touched on sensitive issues of great concern to the people but the Ministers who were supposed to respond either gave scanty information or the questioners after having cold feet decided to duck the session.

\par <#/>Half-baked answers given by Ministers or their assistants for that matter, expose them to ridicule on matters they are supposed to have first-hand knowledge of.
\par <#/>Take, for instance, the question asked by the Ijara MP, Mr Nasir Arte. <#/>He asked an Assist
ant Minister in the President's Office, Mr David Onyancha if he was aware that 4,000 head of cattle were stolen from Kotile Location, Masalani Division, Garissa District in May this year.
\par <#/>Mr Arte said the stolen animals were driven through Garsen bridge which is guarded 24 hours a day by the security forces.
\par <#/>Mr Onyancha was obviously poorly briefed by the civil servants and when questioned closely, he appeared to be completely at sea. <#/>He looked ambushed, hemmed in and surprised with each questio
n fired at him by Mr Arte and other MPs from North Eastern Province.
\par <#/>"Do you know that vehicles transporting some of the stolen cattle to Nairobi were given police escort? <#/>Do you know the number of livestock so far recovered or should I tell you?<#/>" Mr Arte mercilessly bore on.
\par <#/>Speaker Jonathan Ng'eno noticed the tricky situation in which Mr Onyancha was and decided o end his agony by ordering him to carry out further investigations into the allegations made by the MPs.
\par <#/>Sometimes, Ministers take a bashing for no fault of their own. <#/>A civil servant may withhold information or mislead his, Minister n order to protect a malefactor or to <-/coverup> a scandal.
\par <#/>In most cases the MPs already know facts surrounding a case before asking questions and through consistent probing sometimes make a Minister look stupid and incompetent.
\par <#/>When cornered this week, two Assistant Ministers for Education, Mr Fred Omido and Mr Mathew Karauri abandoned a tradition of defending Ministries regardless of the enormity of accusations levelled against them.
\par <#/>Mr Omido stopped short of accusing his Ministry of inefficiency. <#/>He frankl
y admitted that some officers were thoroughly inefficient. <#/>He said he was unable to reply to a question because an officer who had promised to deliver a reply directly to him at Parliament failed to turn up.
\par <#/>When Mr Karauri was faced with the same dilemma, he said he wished he had the power to discipline some of the unbecoming Ministry officials.
\par <#/>However, not all MPs have sharp wits and some after raising fundamental issues, fail to get to the truth through asking pertinent supplementary questio
ns. <#/>Others are upstaged by crafty Ministers who reply glibly to questions without ever committing their Ministries into doing anything.
\par <#/>Some questions literally become still-born after the MPs fail to ask them once they are put in the Order Paper. 
<#/>This is despite the fact that MPs have the option of instructing their colleagues to raise questions on their behalf. <#/>This week several questions went unanswered and the most vivid example was that of the capricious Molo MP, Mr Njenga Mungai.

\par <#/>He was to ask the Minister for Environment and Natural Resources if he was aware about people who had moved into Nessuit and Marashioni forests and were now living there.
\par <#/>Had the Government then reversed the policy of not allowing people to build houses or settle in <use/>gazetted forests, he was to ask.
\par <#/>Mr Mungai claimed that these people had enrolled their children in schools formerly used by forest workers and squatters. <#/>He was, therefore, to ask if former squatters would be compensated since 
they had built most of the schools on a <ea/>Harambee basis. <#/>But he never came to the House to ask his question.
\par <#/>Despite this seemingly half-hearted interest in Parliamentary proceedings, a resurgence of self-confidence could be detected among the legislators.
\par <#/>Buoyed by the total confusion and internecine fighting in the opposition camp, the legislators have been talking with growing confidence that Kanu would win in the coming multi-party elections.
\par <#/>Some months ago, when the opposition was wallowing in euphoria and over-confidence, very few MPs could muster the courage to identify themselves with Kanu.
\par <#/>But today, even legislators considered liberal such as the Changamwe MP, Mr Kennedy Kiliku and Mr Njenga Mungai have openly reaffirmed th
eir total support for Kanu. <#/>The Kibwezi MP, Mrs Agnes Ndetei declared that the majority of Kamba are solidly behind Kanu and President Moi.
\par <#/>The feeling is that little is being heard of the DP while FORD is on the way to the sewer.
\par <#/>But politics being what it is, Kenyans could be in for a few surprises in the coming months.

\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 If one had any illusions about Parliament unearthing and censuring the 
authors of the recent politically-instigated ethnic clashes mainly in the Rift Valley Province and Western Kenya, then the volatile debate on the Kiliku Report should have dimmed those illusions.
\par <#/>Mr Kennedy Kiliku (Changamwe) and his team who spent nearly four months interviewing nearly 850 witnesses and compiling the Report have been subjected to criticism and even insults by those named in the report and their supporters.
\par <#/>Listening to the debate on the Report, it would appear that the spirit of multi-partism which, essentially means tolerance and accommodation, is still academic to most legislators who still live in the past.
\par <#/>It may be expecting too much to hope the legislators will adopt the Report but the least they can do is to stop disparaging individual Committee Members and personalising the Report.
\par <#/>One can only hope that an overwhelming negative vote on the Report will not mean the end of investigations into one of the most diabolical violence ever unleashed on innocent citizens.
\par <#/>A number of legislators mentioned adversely in the Report have vehemently denied being involved in any way in the violence without explaining why they and not others were mentioned.
\par <#/>Some would even like Kenyans to believe that it was the opposition, mainly FORD and the clergy who instigated and financed the clashes.
\par <#/>But if this was true, why didn't the Government arrest even a single opposition figure or clergyman in connection with the violence? <#/>Why did the security forces dilly-dally in their endeavour to contain the violence?
\par <#/>If the Government was able to arrest the underground Mwakenya Members, it would not have been difficult to swoop on the warriors and their paymasters who were operating above board.
\par <#/>One of the Report critics, Mr Kalonzo Musyoka (Deputy Speaker) strenuously defended the advocates of }{\i\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>majimboism}{\fs24\lang2057 
 (federalism) and went ahead to denounce American Congressman Joseph Kennedy II for linking the Government with the clashes.
\par <#/>Mr Musyoka quoted the following extracts from Mr Kennedy's submissions to the Congress as some of the utterances which infuriated him most:
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 "Too many Kenyans have died in vain. <#/>The Moi Government would like us to think that inter- ethnic rivalry is the cause of this violence but there are 
unmistakable signs which suggest the violence is part of a carefully orchestrated campaign by the Government to forestall openly-contested elections and to ensure that President Moi continues his strangle-hold on power.
\par <#/>"The recent interception of a shipment of arrows that were imported by a company owned by President Moi's son is strong indication that the Government aids and abets violence in Kenya.\rdblquote 
\par <#/>Exclaimed Mr Kalonzo: "What a shame! <#/>It is a shame because we know it differently. }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 What untruthfulness!\rdblquote 
\par <#/>He submitted that the clashes were the work of international spies and secret agents.
\par <#/>Whatever may be surmised of Mr Musyoka's contribution, he portrayed a humanitarian gesture by expressing sympathy with those whose relatives were killed in the clashes or had their property destroyed or looted.
\par <#/>The inflammatory and intemperate speech made by an Assistant Minister for Planning and National Development, Mr Noor Abdi Ogle, on }{\i\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>majimbo}{\fs24\lang2057  showed what a dim view he had of the Constitution.
\par <#/>The Constitution is unequivocal as to the unitary nature of the Kenyan nation. <#/>Section 1 of Chapter 1 of the Constitution declares: "Kenya is a sovereign Republic.\rdblquote 
\par <#/>Mr Ogle's }{\i\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>majimbo}{\fs24\lang2057  remarks were reminiscent of the slogans of the leaders of the Shifts secessionist movement of the early sixties.
\par <#/>The Assistant Minister began his contribution by declaring that the Report was in tune with the opposition's malicious attempt to tarnish the name of prominent Members of the Govern
ment and by extension, the Government itself and turning Kenyan communities against one another.
\par <#/>He claimed that the FORD Agip chairman, Mr Oginga Odinga and the DP chairman Mr Mwai Kibaki just went to advise the committee on how to write the Report and implicate persons they thought should be implicated in this serious matter.
\par <#/>Mr Ogle then dropped the bombshell: "I was a proponent of }{\i\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>majimboism}{\fs24\lang2057  and I still am. <#/>Whatever might have been said against }{\i\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>majimboism}{\fs24\lang2057 , some of us are able to st
and up here and say that we are unrepentant advocates of }{\i\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>majimboism}{\fs24\lang2057 .\rdblquote 
\par <#/>The Assistant Minister, who equates }{\i\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>majimbo}{\fs24\lang2057  with democracy, may do well to understand that democracy is a political terminology while }{\i\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>majimbo}{\fs24\lang2057  is a secession terminology.

\par <#/>Challenged by an Assistant Minister for Tourism and Wildlife, Mr Zachariah Gakunju <-/OM> that }{\i\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>majimbo}{\fs24\lang2057 
 meant disintegration of Kenya as a unitary state, Mr Ogle retorted: "Some of us tend to cling to the old illusion, that they have the exclusive rights of opinion in this country.\rdblquote 
\par <#/>Even at this moment in time, Shariff Nassir (Mombasa Kanu Chairman) does not believe in multi-partism and believes that the repeal of Section 2 (a) of the Constitution is solely to blame for the clashes.
\par <#/>Mr Nassir told the House this week that multi-partism was introduced rather abruptly to a people ill-prepared for it. <#/>All <-_what><+_that> the people can do now is to fight one another over political parties, he said.
\par <#/>Turning to his pet subject of a bloodbath, Mr Nassir said: "I have never seen such a dangerous Report which could make Kenyans to spill blood as this Kiliku Report.\rdblquote

\par <#/>His latest quotation is sterling 5.70 (about Shs 249) per gramme paid on any international currency!

\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 At a recent church s

 most expensive due to the brideprice, tag placed on them by their parents.
\par <#/>Well, I have some tips which may be useful to young Kenyans who still have faith in the institution and who may not have identified their potential brides. <#/>I would not like to disappoint brides already promised a wedding ring.
\par <#/>Try South Korea. <#/>Here they will not pay brideprice instead they will be paid bridegroom price. <#/>Although this practice is in several other countries in Asia, South Korea could be likened to K
isii but in a different sense. <#/> In South Korea the bridegroom price has gone up so much that the value of an average dowry paid to the male is about Shs 2,000,000 in addition to gifts to the man's parents of almost the same amount.
\par <#/>Ladies, do not h

a. <#/>A recent report by AFP <-_attest><+_attests> to my findings.
\par <#/>An increasing number of South Korean brides are facing broken marriages or cruel treatment from their husbands and mothers-in-law for not bringing dowries worth tens of thousands of dollars.
\par <#/>Of the estimated 300,000 marriages a year here, one in three ends with the bride leaving or chased out by her bridegroom, often over the dowry issue.

\par <#/>Luckily another waiter concurred with me that the meat was bad but that was not much of luck }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>idiom}{\fs24\lang2057  as I was asked, a question similar to the ones I have been asked in few occasions }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057

\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Were I to choose between Grace Akinyi Ogot t
he writer and Honourable Grace Ogot the politician, I would easily go for Lady Ogot the writer and country woman. <#/>As a writer she understood her world and spoke for many - men and women - she had a social purpose and championed a cause.
\par <#/>Her sympath
ies, for example, in Land Without Thunder, one of her books, were with the oppressed woman.<#/>, Oganda who must be sacrificed for the whims of male gods to bring rain to a dying generation. <#/>The decision to sacrifice this young woman was made by a gro
up of elders - all men.
\par <#/>The traditional world in which Lady Ogot grew up is a bastion of male chauvinism, a world that denied women the right to independence, excellence and respect. <#/>It is a world in which men hold the knife and the pumpkin, as they
 controlled the destiny of women. <#/>It is a world past and a world present.
\par <#/>Such was the context that gave Dr Maria Nzoma's thesis credibility, and such is the world former Kenya Times editor, Philip Ochieng, <-/hiped> on. <#/>It is world of gender imbalance so much under scrutiny today in most parts of the world.
\par <#/>Why should our place be an exception? <#/>Why should anyone feel offended when such critical issues are raised? <#/>Nzomo and Ochieng are only being true to forces sweeping humanity - forces of freedom, independence and fair play.
\par <#/>They are questioning, as many have, why more than half the human race should live under male subjection - alienated from policies and decisions.
\par <#/>If women were to be equal partners in the development of humanity and our own nation, then something should be done to address the status quo.
\par <#/>Although in our own time much has changed in gender relations and women are influential citizens they are influential only behind the scenes.
\par <#/>As admitted recently by leaders of Maendeleo ya Wanwake in their belated response to what they call unprovoked scheme to discredit women leadership, women are inconspicuous.
\par <#/>They say the woman partner plays a major advisory role behind the scenes. <#/>By their own confessi
on, these leaders subscribe to the notion that women should rather be seen but not heard. <#/>They are enveloped and engulfed by men bred in the old conservative style at loggerheads with modernity.
\par <#/>These are the men who will stand in a public rally an
d shamelessly say: ""We will rape the women.<#/>" Men of confidence who will say of their critics: "(They) have grouped like women rejected by men and have been going to Chester House like prostitutes trying to attract men clients.<#/>" And of leaders who
 will say: <ea_>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 Kuna mama mmoja<ea/>}{\fs24\lang2057 , and whimper righteously that women's place is in the kitchen.
\par <#/>When men in leadership talk thus, it undermines women's confidence.
\par <#/>It will be noted that the number of women in <-/consipicuous> leadership position
s is dismal compared to their population. <#/>They are <-/unvenly> represented everywhere - even in crime. <#/>The people who claim to represent the women are worlds apart. <#/>They are so lonely up there to effectively speak, leave alone represent, the o
rdinary woman down here.
\par <#/>Life at Honourable Ogot's Reinsurance Plaza is so different that she cannot fully relate to the brutalised and hard-working village woman from Kilome. <#/>She cannot credibly speak for the humble, labouring woman from Chepalungu.
\par <#/>Once they arrive up there, they only occasionally talk about the ordinary voters to purge their own conscience. <#/>The horde of villagers who fail after seeking audiences with them for months on end, tell this story even much better. <#/>By her own 
defence, Hon Ogot says she had been <-/fighing> for women to get house allowances and many other things.
\par <#/>She has also challenged women in business and executive positions to resign and contest parliamentary seats. <#/>She also wants at least four seats preserved for women MPs. <#/>According to her Parliament seems to be the ultimate.
\par <#/>But why only four when women are more than half the voting population? <#/>Why should the seats be preserved? <#/>Can't women stand up and fight for them? <#/>And Hon O
got says the seats should be in major urban areas. <#/>Why not in rural areas where women are the majority and where their status is most pathetic?
\par <#/>The legislator says she proposed this in 1988 and was rudely opposed by men. <#/>With this kind of resistance, Ogot should begin to see that there is something wrong with gender relations.
\par <#/>The former MP for Karachuonyo had more than enough of this male arrogance during her days as a Member of Parliament. <#/>The issues were not that of effective represen
tation but that of how a woman can represent Karachuonyo - a place with a high concentration of educated and intelligent men. <#/>Sexism featured prominently as Okiki Amayo's supporters ridiculed Asiyo's leadership, not on the basis of ability, but merely
 on her being a woman. <#/>Asiyo was herself the most able leader that place had seen since the days of the late Omolo Agar.
\par <#/>On account of this gender persecution women leaders should be at the forefront of basic social education - perhaps the only way of curing this male arrogance so trendy in patrilineal societies.
\par <#/>In their evasive reply to critics published by another paper the women leaders missed the grasp of the argument. <#/>In fact the people they refer to as critics are only asking them to sensitise society to this retrograde gender imbalance.
\par <#/>The people and the Press accused of undermining women leadership are simply asking those at the top to use their political voices to speak for the abused and brutalised women.
\par <#/>Hon Ogot, instead 
of addressing the issue affecting women sees the Press as a gang of hired men to discredit women's leadership. <#/>She says women are gagged when only the other day a Nation reporter gave the women at the top a chance to respond to Nzomo and Ochieng. <#/>
They were all found to be "not available for comment". <#/>Mrs Ndetei was also not available for comment. <#/>But she will be available for votes.
\par <#/>Now, do women want to be silent when they have a chance to talk, to defend their voters and prepare for greater stakes in national leadership? <#/>How will the public know them if they don't want to talk about such weighty issues?
\par <#/>Our own research <-_indicate><+_indicates> that Hon Ogot, Onsando, Ojiambo and other women in leadership are making a political response to a valid comment on a social problem.
\par <#/>Let them look around and appreciate the sexist coloration of the world about them. <#/>About three quarters of Christians are women and it is their tithes that support the church leadership. <#/>Then, s
houldn't it strike them as strange that nearly all church leaders are men, that it is men giving the Sunday sermon while women sit and nod.
\par <#/>The Church of England (Anglican) has for a long time resisted proposals that women should become priests. <#/>Conservative Christians have threatened to break away should women be allowed near the altar.
\par <#/>The church, a microcosm of our own society, is a bastion of male chauvinism. <#/>The Bible and the manner of discourse in the church reflect l
ife as understood by men: "Our Father who art in Heaven". <#/>The idea that only males can represent Christ is a man's conception of reality.
\par <#/>In our place where the church is so influential in the lives of people, it should be strange that its leadership alienates women.
\par <#/>In a rather sober speech, Mrs Margaret Githinji, the first and the only women Permanent Secretary, had this to say to an assembly of women.
\par <#/>"We all know that women have always occupied a central role in the African societies as home-makers, mothers, wives, agricultural producers ...\rdblquote 
\par <#/>The conventional idea of the woman as the good housewife, loving mother, the submissive feminine, the beauty queen, and such other stereotypes, still haunt us.
\par <#/>Then, her greatest ambition was to be a good mother to her children, a good wife to her husband, a good in-law to her kinspeople and a beast of burden for the husband's clan.
\par <#/>That kind of attitude comments adversely on why only few women had the advantage of early education.
\par <#/>The
 few that had an education could have been daughters of colonial civil servants, church leaders and converts. <#/>A study of the family backgrounds of these few women at the top will reveal their missionary or colonial connections. <#/>They are the lucky 
few to have broken from conservatism of keeping the women in the kitchen.
\par <#/>Meanwhile, traditionalists trained their daughters in the ancestral way. <#/>The traditionalists were many and influential and that is why there is still a bulwark of gender imbalance in all our institutions.
\par <#/>The woman did not have as much chance and opportunity as her brothers. <#/>Nature and nurture conspired to condition the woman's ambition only to becoming an excellent cook.

\par <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057  Mayor Mwangi restoring city sanity </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Four months into representative leadership at the City Hall, something flattering can be said of the City Council. <#/>Sanity and accountability are returning to a place that h
ad suffered gross neglect because the appointed caretakers were not answerable to the millions of rate payers enclosed by garbage and dancing along foot-deep potholes.
\par <#/>There is, so to speak, some signs that the current government at City Hall cares about the welfare of service charge payers. <#/>There are signs that somebody is trying to become accountable to the people who pay to maintain the city government.

\par <#/>But this is not to say that the legacy of the late commissions is as good as forgotten. <#
/>For it is hardly logical to expect the four-month-old multi-party broom to sweep the city clean of the corruption, insensitivity, laxity, incompetence and bureaucratic abuse it suffered under the management of hand-picked and hen-picked commissioners.

\par <#/>The memory of the terrifying potholes on city roads is still sharp, and the city government must work round the clock to earn the credibility long lost.
\par <#/>It is true something has been done and is being done to make Nairobi habitable. <#/>In Eastleigh, for example, residents can say, they have been given some attention.
\par <#/>That, however, is not enough because the new reality demands nothing short of thoroughness ands accountability from its elected councillors. <#/>They were given the mandate to serve the people, and they have to do so diligently.
\par <#/>It is understandable if the David Kongo team - the immediate casualties of multi-partyism - were reluctant to clean the city, repair roads, protect public land, and ensure the city was <-/spick and span> b
ecause they were not elected by the people, and therefore did not owe their positions to the city residents.
\par <#/>The commissioners could get away with laxity and recklessness but Mayor Steve Mwangi's team is thoroughly on the spot. <#/>Steve Mwangi cannot 
afford to be complacent because he is surrounded by baying dogs, looking for one false step to justify another dictatorship by selected commissioners.
\par <#/>Because of this precarious position, Mwangi should remember that although they have started serving the people, they have not done enough to meet the expectations of city residents.
\par <#/>For example, there is no good reason why rate payers should pay for non-existent dustbins. <#/>If the City Council must continue to demand Sh 10 for dustbins, the City Hal
l should ensure that every house with a water meter has a dustbin, otherwise paying monthly bills for a dead service amounts to stealing by pretence - stealing from the public.
\par <#/>In this age which is supposed to be characterised by transparency, Nairobi residents will not condone fraud by the maiden city government. <#/>The City Hall must be able to tell the people how the service charge is spent.
\par <#/>It is true potholes are being sealed in a number of streets, an the at City Council employees from the Cleansing Department can be seen sweeping at sundown, but the City Hall still needs to ensure that street lights are working.
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Were a city resident or visitor to be accosted at a dark corner where a street light is supposed to be in place, the victim would be justified to sue the City Council for colluding with thugs to harass rate payers.

\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Those who dismissed Mayor Mwangi's enthusiasm as the excitement that comes with a new job, now realise that the team, given time and support, can help the city regain its sanity.

\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Sometime in October last year, there came the proponents of the retrograde monster of <ea/>majimboism. <#/>I said in this column that these Rift valley-based MPs were the greatest threat to Kenya's security.
\par <#/>These latter-day campaigners for the now-defunct Kadu's federalist politics were obviously opposed to the unitarist Kanu principles which the founding fathers conceived of Kenya.

\par <#/>Shariff Nassir - he who thinks there is only one tribe in America - was in Wajir telling the people that should they vote for Kanu in the forthcoming polls, he will ensure that one of the elected representatives gets a ministerial post.
\par <#/>Who? <#/>Nassir!?
\par <#/>Let me tell you something; these fellows, in their zest and zeal, fever and fervour to campaign for President Moi and Kanu are messing up.
\par <#/>I have previously - twice, in fact - argued in these columns that the Kanu leadership is vindictive. <#/>Nobody has challenged me on that score and now that we have isolationists, people who are saying vote for Kanu or 
else, then I have been proved right.
\par <#/>Isolationists are advocates of revenge, but I have warned in this column (Dec 22, 1991) that any leader who engages in the politics of revenge courts disaster. <#/>History is full of examples of governments which em
barked on a course of revenge and ended disastrously.
\par <#/>Any government which stigmatises its own people courts its own downfall. <#/>What is going to happen is that certain communities will be identified - blacklisted is a better word - as anti-Kanu. <#/
>It will not matter that communities are made up of individuals, and the best way to treat individuals is to understand, as the age-old adage goes, that different folks have different views.
\par <#/>What we are being warned about by the cousins of <ea/>majimbo
ists is that there will be witch-hunting after elections by Kanu operatives should the party form the next government. <#/>What we are being told here is that voting for Kanu will be equal to loving one's country, and voting for the opposition is a show o
f lack of patriotism.
\par <#/>I am reminded of Arthur Miller's splendid play, }{\i\fs24\lang2057 The Crucible}{\fs24\lang2057 
, about the Salem witch-hunts in Massachusetts, USA, but which actually captures vividly the fiasco and terror that was the search for communists (the reds) in the United States in the 1950s by Joseph MacCarthy.
\par <#/>In the Salem witch-hunts, anybody could just brand anybody, including very upright and decent people, a witch and subject them to all sorts of torture, mental anguish and condemnation. <#/>The same applied to MacCarthy's hunt for communists.
\par <#/>That i
s what the isolationists want. <#/>Perhaps, it is time to question the patriotism of these people. <#/>I think a patriot upholds the constitution of his or her country. <#/>Our constitution clearly says that one shall not be discriminated against on accou
nt of their religion, tribe, race or political beliefs.
\par <#/>Who swears on the Bible to uphold and protect the Constitution? <#/>These selfsame isolationalists. <#/>Did the President not warn against the politics of tribe and tribalism, of tribal hatred and 
disunity on Moi Day? <#/>He did. <#/>But when these isolationists took to the stumps to campaign for him and Kanu, they forgot about that.
\par <#/>Somebody is introducing the reprehensible politics of the }{\i\fs24\lang2057 winner takes it all and the loser forsakes everything}{\fs24\lang2057 . 
<#/>We are being told that this is what the coming election will be all about. <#/>That is a recipe for disaster. <#/>That is rather like telling the losers to secede. <#/>President Moi's clarion call, as was the late President Kenyatta's, has been the un
ity of Kenya.
\par <#/>Kenyans must reject <ea/>majimboists and their cousins, the isolationists. <#/>They are a danger to the security of this country. <#/>The next government must not engage on a course of revenge; it must respect the freedom of choice. <#/>El
ections are about choice, not coercion.

\par <#/>He is the PC who wondered why people who had eaten what he called Kanu food - possibly chicken was served - were reluctant to cheer the <ea/>jogoo (cockerel), Kanu's symbol.
\par <#/>Mr Lekolol is the PC who was photographed wearing a Kanu cap at the party's Delegates Conference at Kasarani's Moi International Sports Centre recently.
\par <#/>This PC was last week telling civil servants in Western Province to vote for Kanu. <#/>He wondered aloud how the civil servants were not supporting Kanu yet, he said, the opposition had already lost.
\par <#/>One wonders why he would be urging the civil servants to vote for Kanu when its is }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 obvious that Kanu has won the election. <#/>One wonders why he would be so concerned about the fact the servants are backing the losing horse.
\par <#/>However, given the fact that the provincial administration has been telling civil servants to either vote for Kanu or face the sack, then it is opportune to ask a fundamental question:
\par If democracy is about choice, then why are civil servants being denied their fundamental right of choosing their leaders? <#/>Why are they being coerced? <#/>Are they not citizens?
\par <#/>Are civil servants paid by Kanu or are they paid by the tax-payer? <#/>That is a rhetorical question, but it is pertinent and the answer is that civil servants are paid by the tax-payer and tax-payers are not just Kanu members. <#/>Tax-payers are Ken
yans and members of the opposition are also Kenyans who pay tax.
\par <#/>Civil servants must be left alone to make their choices. <#/>To force them to vote for Kanu is to rig the elections. <#/>The elections cannot be free and fair when the imposing posture of
 the PC (<ea/>serikali to most rural folk) tells people who they should vote for.

\par <#/>According to reports last week, more than 50,000 bags of skimmed milk powder supplied to Kenya by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) is to be disposed of after public health officials declared the stock unfit for human consumption!
\par <#/>The milk, which was reported to have been given to Kenya during the 1982 drought, amounts to a <-/collosal> 1.16 million kilogrammes and was left to go to waste so it can now only be sold for non-food purposes.
\par <#/>What went wrong?
\par <#/>If it is that the country recovered from the drought before it could exhaust the supply of milk from the WFP, surely the authorities would still have made arrangements to have the milk put to better use.
\par <#/>Why this loss of food? <#/>How can we run to Western capitals to beg for food in time of adversity and when fortunes change and we have food aplenty, turn round and with untold arrogance forget that we might need help in the not so distant future!

\par <#/>We all know, for example, that there are hundred
s of social and charity workers in this country who scrimp and save just to get enough to feed the destitute and orphaned children in children's homes and they would have loved to lay their hands on this milk.
\par <#/>In the spirit of being mindful of the welf
are of our brethren, we would have given this milk free of charge to these children's homes or sold it to them - if we absolutely had to and we did not because it was for free - for a minimal charge. <#/>As it is, we will wait for <-/Chrismastide> to give
 them palty gifts!
\par <#/>Other people, acting on humanitarian grounds, gave us millions of kilogrammes of milk but we did not even think of giving it to the poor of the sprawling Mathare slums in Nairobi or any where else for that matter, because even when it
 is a time of plenty, there are those among us who still go hungry. <#/>That is a fact of life.
\par <#/>Part of the reason why Africa, which decades ago could have fed the world, is forever on the brink of hunger and famines is that when there was plenty of food, plans for the security of it were never made.
\par <#/>That is what has led Kenya into this extremely embarrassing scandal over this relief milk. <#/>If we are hit by adversity again, shall we be confident enough to ask WFP to give us milk?

\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The way I see it, very soon some people will invite us to <ea/>Harambee meetings to raise funds to pay bills for their sick pets.
\par <#/>Anything goes in this country where mone
y is such a loved but scarce commodity so do not get surprised when one day you get a card saying, "Mr and Mrs W.M. invite you to a <ea/>Harambee meeting to raise money for the hospital bill of their cat, Tabby, who has been indisposed. <#/>Your generous 
donation will be highly appreciated".
\par <#/>I say that because although <ea/>Harambee has been the dynamo that has mov
ed the real people's projects in this country, it has been hijacked by individuals who see it as a well from which to draw money without trying too hard. <#/>It has been abused and has now degenerated into as irritating an affair as having a finger being 
poked into your eyes.
\par <#/>Most Kenyans never hesitate to give generously to help build hospitals, schools, dispensaries and other amenities that better their lives. <#/>They are keen to help send students abroad, to pay hospital bills for those who have inc
urred them yet cannot raise the required money. <#/>They are indeed ready to raise money to send patients abroad for treatment.
\par <#/>It is that spirit of giving for worthy causes until it pains that some Kenyans who see nothing else in front of their eyes e
xcept money flowing from other people's into their own are exploiting and thus turning <ea/>Harambee into a personal mercantile system.
\par <#/>I witnessed one of such <-_insult><+_insults> to <ea/>Harambee recently. <#/>The occasion was called <ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 itega}{\fs24\lang2057 , whi
ch I understand is an occasion to "greet" a new-born baby with gifts. <#/>It is nothing new in many Kenyan communities as it was the occasion when women used to go and "spit" blessings on the chest of the infant wishing it a prosperous life. <#/>We read i
n the Bible of Wise Men going to visit baby Jesus with gifts. <#/>In traditional Kenyan societies such visitors would carry gifts that were available and appropriate for that age.
\par <#/>As economies changed and the traditional systems were now inundated with 
commercial goods, so did the gifts for infants change. <#/>Visitors started going to the "spitting" sessions with baby soap, formula foods, nappies, sugar, tea leaves and such other }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>idiom}{\fs24\lang2057 
 commodities. <#/>The practice still holds as it is good manners to welcome a baby into this world of troubles with a reassuring gift. <#/>That is as it should be, but the occasion has now been hijacked by the money-hungry.
\par <#/>In its sane form, normally one is not invited to an <ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 itega}{\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>One goes to the occasion 
because one knows the parents of the child and wants to share in their joy. <#/>Not any more with the modern version modelled on <ea/>Harambee.
\par <#/>Now you get an invitation through a neatly printed card. <#/>When you receive that card, you should know tha
t you are not being invited to join in the joy of welcoming a child into this world. <#/>Know that when you accept such an invitation, you have committed yourself to having money milked out of you.
\par <#/>I say milked because once you get where the occasion is, you will find that there is a guest of honour and that his work there is not }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_to>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057

of the parents who had brought forth yet another Kenyan into the world. <#/>You see, it had to be a big room so that as many wallet-owners could be accommodated.
\par <#/>There was a live band, too, not just to entertain guests but to also soften them enough so that they could see sense in emptying their purses to "greet" the new child.
\par <#/>Entry into the hall was subject to one condition: That you wear a flower that cost Sh30 on your lapel. <#/>If you ask me, I could just have picked up that flower for nothing 
by the roadside, but then this was an occasion to "spit" blessings on the baby and saliva must be made as expensive as possible. <#/>Hence the highly priced flower.
\par <#/>On paying that fee for a flower at the "toll station", we entered the hall and were sho
wn to our seats. <#/>Then followed what was supposed to be a meal - stringy pieces of meat thrown around in a plate with scattered grains. <#/>I guessed that was supposed to soften us, but I was not impressed.
\par <#/>No sooner had we "fed" than the master of 
ceremonies took up the microphone and after praising the couple for bringing into this world a "beautiful baby" - handed over the function to the guest of honour. <#/>The man did not waste time. <#/>He went ahead and announced: "My role here is very simpl

\par <#/>I am sure that when the parents of the baby retired home after the event, they must have smiled all the way to bed and to the bank the following day. <#/>The dream of buyi
ng those acres at Ngong must have then become a reality by raising money through false pretences.
\par <#/>They must have congratulated themselves not only on getting a child but also on duping other Kenyans into pouring out their wallets to welcome it. <#/>It 
is indeed saddening that such a couple would have a sound sleep, their conscience undisturbed by the fact that they have received money dishonestly.
\par <#/>That to me is sheer greed, the same avarice that is manifest in the so-called pre-wedding parties. <#/>In reality, they are not parties but pre-wedding <ea/>Harambees.
\par <#/>They are <ea/>Harambees because, like that <ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 itega}{\fs24\lang2057 , there is a guest of honour whose primary purpose is to coax the guests into giving their last cent for the simple cause of a man get
ting a wife. <#/>Let nobody tell me that they raise that money because the bridegroom cannot pay for his dowry.
\par <#/>Even if the man could not raise the dowry, he is not like that patient who has missed money to pay for his hospital bills. <#/>Marriage is n
ot an incidental and accidental affair so even if someone does not have enough resources, then he should not make an attempt to marry at all and in the process call a <ea/>Harambee for it.

\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The way I see it is that banning plays from being staged in Kenya is a very uncreative role on the part of censors.
\par <#/>Unfortunately, this is the tragic drama now unfolding; an unfortunate script done by censors who hide behind all manner of excuses to frustrate the development of drama in Kenya.
\par <#/>In about a month, the censors' axe has felled two scripts that are well known, one of which has won international appeal in its novel form.
\par <#/>First to be axed was}{\i\fs24\lang2057  Ngahika Ndenda}{\fs24\lang2057  jointly scripted by two self-exiled Kenyans: Professor Ngugi was Thiong'o and Ngugi wa Mirii. <#/>The Gikuyu play was intended for staging by Sar
akasi Players at their Kenyatta International Conference Centre basement hall last month.
\par <#/>Then last week the curtain fell prematurely for Theatre Yetu's adaptation of George Orwell's novel, }{\i\fs24\lang2057 Animal Farm}{\fs24\lang2057 , which they were to stage as a Kiswahili play, }{\i\fs24\lang2057 Shamba la Wanyama}{\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>They had support <-/form> the British Council in Nairobi and were to stage it at the Kenya National Theatre.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057  }{\b\fs24\lang2057 Eleventh Hour}{\fs24\lang2057  </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 It was reported that the censors arrived at the eleventh hour before production and produced a 
banning order saying, "it is deemed appropriate that the licence (for public production) not be given now, but Government officials are still studying the script".
\par <#/>In the case of}{\i\fs24\lang2057  Ngahika Ndenda}{\fs24\lang2057 , there was no such protocol. <#/>It was a case of "bring b
ack the licence we gave you and get out of here before we show you what we are capable of doing to you". <#/>Those who came to demand the licence back were kind of saying that the actors and actresses had already committed a crime by imagining that they c
ould stage the play.
\par <#/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 Ngahika Ndenda }{\fs24\lang2057 and}{\i\fs24\lang2057  Animal Farm}{\fs24\lang2057 
 are not some of those documents that have been declared seditious. <#/>They are freely available in the bookshops and the former is published locally. <#/>In other words, they are not circulated in the
 dark in forfeited bunkers. <#/>You can buy them as freely as you can buy and read the Kanu manifesto and a copy of the Bible.
\par <#/>That notwithstanding, }{\i\fs24\lang2057 Ngahika Ndenda }{\fs24\lang2057 has been banned from public performance before when it was staged at Kamirithu, Limuru, 
by villagers. <#/>The open-air theatre where it was performed to record audiences was subsequently razed down }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>idiom}{\fs24\lang2057  by administration officials who declared it an "anti-development" forum.
\par <#/>One could guess why it attracts the <-_censors><+_censor's>
 pen so easily. <#/>One reason is that the name of Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Kenya's foremost novelist, makes some people get goose pimples immediately. <#/>They get jitters, agitated and even paranoid when his name is mentioned although I doubt whether they hav
e all read his books.
\par <#/>The man has earned himself all the negative superlatives that the Kenyan political dictionary has. <#/>he has been called a "servant of foreign masters", a "peddler of foreign ideologies", "enemy of development", "unpatriotic" and 
earned himself other vitriol from the blazing mouths of politicians.
\par <#/>No censor would, of course, like to be held responsible for licensing a play written by a man who has been declared a hydra-headed monster. <#/>Surprisingly, however, Sarakisi Players
 had been granted a stage licence and were already rehearsing before it was withdrawn. <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 <#/>The censor must have paused and said: }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 "Hey, wait a minute. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Isn't this play by the same Ngugi wa <-/Thing'o>, the Salman Rushdie of Kenya? }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 I had forgotten that he was an enemy of the people. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057

\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The other possible reason for the ban is that }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 Ngahika Ndenda}{\v\fs24\lang2057  and }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 Animal Farm}{\v\fs24\lang2057  tell uncomfortable truths about society. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
They satirise social ills bred by ill leadership leading to inequitable distribution of resources. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 They unravel the process in which the underdog discovers himself and prepares to throw
 off the yoke of repression that has weighed him down for a long time.

\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 It would be tragic if the plays were denied stage licences for the second reason for it would be a transgression of one of art's prime <-_role><+_roles> in a developing country: }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
To be a barometer of society by praising and criticising.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Whereas some uniformed people say that drama is uniformed people say that drama is <ea/>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 mchezo}{\v\fs24\lang2057 , meaning that it is some sort of cowing on stage, it is not so. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
It is the serious business of re-enacting life on stage to bring out its inadequacies and fullness. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 While playing that role, theatre naturally treads on sore toes. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
It pokes a finger into the sores of some people. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 It has the right to do so painful as it is to the subjects handled. 
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Drama dwells on conflicts and the best theatre is that which intensifies realistic human conflicts on stage. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Such is the case with }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 Shamba la Wanyama}{\v\fs24\lang2057  and }{
\i\v\fs24\lang2057 Ngahika Ndenda.}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 They may be unpalatable to some people because they tell things that are better hidden in the closet, but drama has that role of stripping naked even kings.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The ban on the stage productions of the two plays is also unfortunate because they were to be staged in languages that do not get to be used often enough on stage. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Plays in Kenyan languages other than in Kiswahili have had a very small stake on Kenyan stages while those in Kiswahili have also not made an impact.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 It is such attempts as staging }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 Ngahika Ndenda }{\v\fs24\lang2057 and }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 Shamba la Wanyama }{\v\fs24\lang2057 that give hope for the future of a truly Kenyan theatre in Kenyan languages. }{
\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Such plays should, therefore, be encouraged and not discouraged.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 There are those who will shoot up and say: "Plays in Kenyan languages will promote tribalism! }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Let us have plays in English for the sake of national unity."
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 That is an escapist and retrogressive argument because tribalism is not prompted by the language one speaks but by the cats ones does. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 You may speak all the English there is in
 the world, but be the leading tribalist by your deeds which will include giving all the best jobs to your tribesmen.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 I have heard it said in the past that most Kenyan plays are political and, therefore, not classifiable as drama. there have even been 
proposals that more emphasis be put on such playwrights as William Shakespeare allegedly because their works are not political. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Such recommendations are made out of ignorance because Shakespeare is political depending on how you look at his plays. }{\v <#/>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 Othelo}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
, for example, which seems to be a tale of lovers, has a political message if you look at it creatively. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Politics is part of drama and that it is how it should be.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The way I see it then is that,}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct}{\v\fs24\lang2057  censors should realise that dram is not expected to pamper ill institutions. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057

ion- making process has to traverse. <#/>But he is achieving results.
\par <#/>Further, he has proved that he is a man who is sensitive to the nuances of global scheming and manoeuvring. <#/>A good example: When the Security Council - heavily influenced by the n
ow all powerful Western powers - twiddled their fingers and scratched their heads debating whether or not peace-keeping troops should be sent to Yugoslavia, an exasperated Dr Boutros-Ghali told them that they were doing so because it was not a rich man's 
war. <#/>Soon after, UN troops landed in Yugoslavia.
\par <#/>An even poorer man's war is being fought in Somalia, although famine and hunger are killing far more people than the fighting clans ever will. <#/>United Nations troops, again thanks to Dr Boutros-Gha
li's determined intervention, have arrived and more will be going in.
\par <#/>However, their mandate is to protect the food convoys which lately have become targets of attack from bandits who see the food as easily available, highly demanded loot. <#/>Since it
 is imperative that the food should reach the hungry, helpless and dying Somalis, it must be protected.
\par <#/>While it is heartening, therefore, to note that UN troops have arrived to perform this task, it is equally important that the possibility of their p
laying the role of peace-keepers be considered. <#/>It is not fair to the country and other Somalis - who may not care either way about the war - to be subjected to the horrors they now confront.
\par <#/>Just as it was felt necessary to intervene actively in Y
ugoslavia, so it should be in Somalia. <#/>It is futile to try to save people from dying when there is no country for them to live in. <#/>I think the priorities should be adjusted to include the mission to save what is left of Somalia.

\par <#/>In a way, the punishment appears

\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The management of the "ultra-modern" Jomo Kenyatta Internation
al Airport (JKIA) comes in for a major barb this week for letting one of the more pre-eminent symbols of successful public investment fall on hard times when it should be right at the cutting edge of the latest developments in airport management.
\par <#/>There
 are a number of things which certainly could do with a bit of freshening up at that place, not least the rest rooms and refreshment facilities. <#/>But the incident which specifically attracts this barb happened this week and is, according to information
 gathered there, not unusual.
\par <#/>On Tuesday night, the airport was plunged into darkness for lengthy intervals forcing delays at check-in counters and cash <-_bureaus><+_bureaux>, discontinuation of service at the bars and general confusion as travellers a
rriving to check in found themselves in darkness. <#/>At one point, one of the airlines had to use car headlights to provide light for passengers checking in at its counter.
\par <#/>The general blackout, although quite unusual and unexpected for a busy airport
, is not the worst of lapses either. <#/>The unforgivable one was the almost total cut off of the power supply which lights the runways and the markers which lead in aircraft wishing to land.
\par <#/>The effect of this was that a number of planes could not lan
d, flight connections were thrown into disarray and airlines and travellers were forced to spend extra money for a lapse they had nothing to do with. <#/>I know of one KLM flight which was scheduled to connect through Nairobi for Johannesburg to Amsterdam
 but which, after circling the Nairobi skies for almost four hours, had to go and land in Mombasa. <#/>The consequences of this are all too clear.
\par <#/>Now, I am not an airport administrator. <#/>But knowing what airports are and the possible accidents or ac
ts of sabotage which can be happen there, I seem to think that provision of sufficient light at all times is an absolute imperative. <#/>Does JKIA not have back-up generators which should switch on immediately power fails? <#/>I think it does, but I wonde
r how serviceable they are?
\par <#/>It is my submission that operations of an airport can be grounded for any number of factors, but not because of an ordinary hitch like a power failure.
\par <#/>Certainly, travellers into or out of the country are not going to be 
amused when they learn that their travel arrangements have been messed up because the airport which claims to be tops in Africa could not receive or send out planes. <#/>It is a shameful lapse which glib excuses cannot justify and for which the administra

\par <#/>Far from it, alert police who had seen the incident continued to give chase, stopped the bus, got on board, ordered the bus crew to seal the doors and searched out the thieves whom they arrested.
\par <#/>Result: Ten minutes later the distraught woman went to Kamukunji police station to report the theft, only to be handed her handbag intact. <#/>Congratulations to some of these exemplary Kilonzo men!
\par <#/>Arguments have gone forwards and backwards over the years on the effects of passive smoking on those around you. <#/>Some say it is negligible while others maintain it is far more than a public nuisance and smokers should be 
prosecuted like anyone else who pollutes the environment.
\par <#/>The effects of smoking on the unborn child - if the statistics below are correct - gives the issue a new and quite horrifying dimension, Mothers, please don't. <#/>Husbands, do it outside the ho
use, if indeed you must. <#/>Nearly half of all adults and unborn babies are exposed to danger from passive smoking in Britain, where 12 people die every hour from tobacco- related diseases, a medical report said.
\par <#/>A study by the government's Health Education Executive showed that 48 per cent of unborn babies were exposed to tobacco smoke at home, either because their mothers smoked or because they were exposed to other people's tobacco smoke.
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 <#/>And 45 per cent of all adults in Britain were exposed to tobacco smoke at home either because they smoked themselves or lived with a smoker.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Dr Ann McNeill, HEA Smoking Education Manager, said the report had for the first time estimated the impact of passive smoking in the home.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 "There is compelling evidence that passive smoking, whether before birth or during a child's early years, can cause serious illnesses which stay with children throughout their lives.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 In pregnancy, smoking can cause low birth weight, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or early neo-natal death."
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Children could develop breathing difficulties and middle-ear infection. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Smoking aggravates asthma and harmed the eyes, nose and throat. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
There was also evidence of a link between smoking in pregnancy and cot death, she said.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 "It is frightening to think that nearly four million children in the UK under 10 years of age are being affected by smoking in their own homes," McNeill said.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Smoking was the largest single cause of preventable and premature death in Britain, where it killed 111,000 a year at a cost to hospitals of 740 million dollars.}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>}{\v\fs24\lang2057
