The ultimate objective in the forthcoming multi-party elections should be to elect a government that is sensitive to the problems that affect women. <#/>It is therefore important that one understands the electoral process in a multi-party system.
\par <#/>There are three stages in multi-party elections:
\par <#/>1. }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 Party elections in which members elect party officials: }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>While individual parties may make their own election rules, the common practice is for a voter to produce a party membership card to be allowed t
o vote.
\par <#/>2. }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 Nomination of candidates for the general elections: }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
<#/>This is the process where a party chooses a candidate to compete with candidates from other parties. <#/>It ensures that each party fields only one candidate to avoid too many candidate
s from the same party competing against each other in the general elections. <#/>Commonly, one needs only the party membership card to be allowed to nominate a candidate for that party for the elections.
\par <#/>3. }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 The Presidential, Parliamentary and civic elections or General Elections: }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
<#/>This is the most important stage of the electoral process. <#/>One does not need to be a member of any party to vote in general elections. <#/>One only needs to have registered as a voter and to have been issued with a vote
rs' card to vote. <#/>One also needs an identity card.

\par <#/>(a) Because it is your democratic right:
\par <#/>By voting you exercise your democratic right of electing a government or representative. <#/>Because we cannot all go to parliament where laws are made, we elect capable leaders}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
to go to parliament to implement our wishes. <#/>Besides making laws, parliament is also the only organ which can change the constitution. <#/>The constitution is the document that guarantees righ
ts and freedoms for all citizens. <#/>Whether or not parliament will represent our interests will depend on the quality of}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 the people we choose.
\par <#/>(b) To elect a candidate of my choice:
\par <#/>Because those we elect pass laws and policies which affect all o
f us it is necessary that we should all vote to make sure that the candidate we elect will represent our views. <#/>As women, we have no choice but to favour women candidates where the opportunities arises. <#/>Indeed they are more likely to be gender sen
sitive and capable of articulating women issues in parliament.

\par <#/>3. Manipulation of illiterate and disabled voters: <#/>In this case, polls officials confuse the victims to either vote for the wrong candidates or vote in a manner that would make the ballot be declared a spoilt paper.
\par <#/>4. Increasing of number of v
otes cast: <#/>This involves increasing the number of votes cast to exceed the number of voters registered at that particular polling station or the number of votes cast for a particular candidate. <#/>This is normally done at the counting centres.
\par <#/>5. Buying and destroying voters cards: <#/>This method is used by corrupt and greedy politicians who buy votes from those who are not likely to vote for them and destroying the votes.
\par <#/>6. Bribery and patronage by politicians and their agents: <#/>This is a
 practice that might not be directly obvious and which mainly targets women and women groups. <#/>This might be in form of <ea/>harambee for women projects, offers of patronage and sending of goodwill delegations to the homes of politicians. <#/>At times,
 this form of bribery is conducted by women leaders acting as agents of particular politicians.

 go through your course make sure that you have convenient physical facilities for study. <#/>Do not wait until examinations are around the corner. <#/>You will need a quiet place, well lit. <#/>What is convenient for one person might not be for another. 
<
#/>However you should be able to assess what is suitable for you. <#/>You can as well walk a distance to a good study place rather than waste time where there are distractions. <#/>The library is not always the best place for study since people walk in an

\par <#/>One needs a convenient seat and desk for study so that he can lay out his materials for study and be able to w
rite as he reads. <#/>Also necessary is a good light and ventilation. <#/>Try to use the natural light, daylight, as much as possible and if you have to use artificial light it should not be flickering light and should be free from fumes, as these will af

Noise made by people or TV or radio is <-/distractive>. <#/>It is very difficult for one to concentrate on studies in an environment where every one else is making merry or chatting over a TV programme. <#/>Also, 
if you have young children at home who could distract your attention then you should select a more suitable place away from home.
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \f56\fs20 {\f0 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 It is not possible to give suggestions that suit everyone concerning study skills. <#/>There will be differences depending
 on individual needs and conditions. <#/>For example, some students are day scholars while others are boarders. <#/>They cannot draw similar programmes for study. <#/>Each person must plan according to his situation. <#/>Here are general requirements that
 apply to all.
\par <#/>Study needs a lot of self-discipline. <#/>One must make an effort to keep to his plans. <#/>He must show determination in whatever he is doing. <#/>Planning must be done early and study habits formed early in the course.
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24 Use of Timetable }{\f0\fs24 </h>}{\b\f0\fs24 
\par <#/>}{\f0\fs24 Tabling time means organizing yourself to use your time efficiently. <#/>It refers to arranging what will be done at what time. <#/>The timetable helps you to distribute time appropriately for all subjects without neglecting some. <#/>You 
need a lot of self-discipline to keep to your study time-table. <#/>For example, there is no need studying for one week and then relaxing during the next two. <#/>Good study habits involve working consistently and regularly. <#/>If you devote three hours 
p
er day to private study, you should do that everyday and not unsteadily. <#/>When you prepare your timetable make sure that a particular session of study is not less than an hour. <#/>This is because one takes some time to adjust to study. <#/>However, if
 you sit down to study, make an effort to settle down immediately.

 or those which need more concentration. <#/>If you have a morning session of study, such subjects should be studied early in the morning and other subjects which can be done in a fairly relaxed mood can be studied later in the day.

at you have read. <#/>This will force you to come back to it later and will cause delay in completing your syllabus. <#/>If you rush you are likely to forget what you read soon and it is not going to be useful to you in future.

\par <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
It is important that you make brief notes as you read. <#/>It is assumed that during your course you have been making notes from classroom work and other references and textbooks. <#/>The brief notes referred to above should be what you can refer to at th
e
 last minute to examinations, or between examination sessions. <#/>These should be only brief facts and ideas and are useful because when examinations begin there will be no time to peruse your notes and textbooks. <#/>Also, if your examination timetable 
goes on for about a month, as is the case in KCSE, then you will need briefer notes to refresh your memory and so recall what you had read earlier.
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24 Self Testing }{\f0\fs24 </h>}{\b\f0\fs24 
\par <#/>}{\f0\fs24 Self Testing is a way of finding out if you understand what you are reading. <#
/>You should do this from time to time. <#/>Some textbooks have testing exercises at the end of the units and you can also have Past Paper questions set on a particular topic which you are reading to test yourself with. <#/>If you are in school, your teac
h
er will probably give you and discuss with you questions which you are likely to be asked on particular topics. <#/>You can always consult your teacher but he will advise you not to rely on past examination papers, since examination format can change any 
time. <#/>Try to assemble as many questions as possible on a particular topic to use to test your understanding. <#/>Testing can be repeated several times in order to develop perfection.
\par <#/>The points above will be illustrated further in this handbook
\par <#/>Effective study requires:
\par * Self discipline
\par * Planning
\par * Good physical conditions
\par * Knowledge of syllabus
\par * Correct choice of books
\par * Concentration and thought
\par * Good note-making
\par * Self testing
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24 Know Your Syllabus }{\f0\fs24 </h>}{\b\f0\fs24 
\par <#/>}{\f0\fs24 The first step to take in 
your study is to know your syllabus. <#/>The syllabus can be described as the outline of the work planned to be done per subject during a course. <#/>It is important that you know what you are expected to study in each subject. <#/>This should be discover
e
d very early in the course. <#/>Try to understand the purpose for studying each subject and also the relationship between the different subjects. <#/>For example, you need to know the Geography of a place in order to understand the History of that place w
ell. <#/>You also need to be good at the language used for communication in your study, in this case English, in order to understand and express what you have learnt effectively.
\par <#/>Understanding a syllabus and the motives for doing a subject motivates one to study. <#/>You should also know the courses that those subjects could lead to, so that you pay particular attention to the areas you intend to pursue further.
\par <#/>It must be noted, however, that the syllabus is only the summary of a course and details 
of the subjects must be identified by the teacher or the student. <#/>Several people have difficulty in dealing with a complete course line. <#/>They can score very well when dealing with portions of the syllabus, for example, during class assessments but
 then when faced with a whole syllabus then they get caught up. <#/>Please note that your final examinations will be a test of the whole course work and so you must cover it all.
\par <#/>The candidate must also know the essentials for each subject. <#/>Your tea
cher will tell you about the compulsory sections of your syllabus or areas in which you must pass in order to achieve good results. <#/>Such sections of the syllabus definitely need more attention.
\par <#/>Once you know your syllabus, tick areas covered as you
 study and if any sections remain uncovered, come back and complete them since your examinations will not be on sections of the syllabus but on the whole syllabus. <#/>You can lose a lot of marks in the examination if you can only attempt one part of the 
question asked and not the other because you failed to tackle the latter during study.
\par <#/>Finally, it must be emphasized that the syllabus is only an outline of your course. <#/>The details of your subject study will be covered in class, through use of tex
tbooks and other sources of information on the subject. <#/>Also knowledge of the syllabus for every subject you are studying for examinations is important because this will help you to plan for your revision and to know how much time you need to cover th
e syllabus. <#/>
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24 LOOKING UP INFORMATION }{\f0\fs24 </h>}{\b\f0\fs24 
\par <#/>}{\f0\fs24 Apart from the normal class lessons, you will need to look up information
\par <#/>on particular topics outside the class work. <#/>You cannot rely on class if you want to achieve spectacular results in a 
subject. <#/>The time spent in class for each topic is very short since a syllabus has to be completed in time. <#/>In fact what is really going to be useful to you in life is what you have worked out yourself rather than what you have been given on a pla
te. <#/>For this reason, it is important that a student should know where and how to look up information on specific subjects.
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24 Textbooks }{\f0\fs24 </h>}{\b\f0\fs24 
\par <#/>}{\f0\fs24 For every subject, the Ministry of Education recommends textbooks to be used. <#/>This would be conside
red as the core text and it would be necessary to buy one. <#/>However, you need not buy every other textbook on the subject if you do not have the resources. <#/>You can borrow from libraries or friends. <#/>There is no point keeping textbooks which you 
do not read. <#/>Most of the textbooks are designed for a year's course. <#/>If the year elapses before you read it, there will hardly be time to read it as you will be dealing with a new one.
\par <#/>Textbooks must be used early in the course as there will be 
hardly any time to go through them as examinations approach. <#/>Also, you ought to make notes which you can refer to later as you approach examinations. <#/>Some schools provide textbooks and in this case you have to surrender it to the incoming class an
d so if you do not read it and make notes during that particular year, you will have nothing to refer to once it is taken away.
\par <#/>As said earlier, there will always be a core-textbook recommended for every subject but you will need to look up other books 
as well in order to be better informed. <#/>Your teacher will be willing to give you a list of recommended books on specific topics. <#/>If you do not follow a topic well, ask your teacher for a reading list on that topic. <#/>Some good textbooks also hav
e a bibliography at the back of them or at the end of the units. <#/>These could also be useful.
\par <#/>It is necessary that certain terms used in your textbooks be understood. <#/>The following are examples:

\par <#/>}{\f0\fs24 The index is a list, in alphab

 books on that particular area of study in a short time.
\par <#/>Remember that the library is the best source of information. <#/>Make a point of visiting one regularly. <#/>You can look up a large number of books dealing with any subject in your library so lon
g as you know how to look for the information. <#/>You must learn to use the library Catalogue as well.

\par <#/>}{\v\f0\fs24 When you state briefly the most important facts, ideas or arguments read from a book, you are making notes. <#/>In note taking one writes down the most important points as he listens to a s

\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24 2. BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES <}{\f0\fs24 /h>
\par <#/> Business management begins when you have started a business. <#/>Identification of business opportunities is the foundation for starting a business. <#/>Your ability to manufacture a product, or offer a service becomes the source of further busin
ess opportunities. <#/>Correct identification of business opportunities is one of the most important ingredients of business success. <#/>So give it very serious consideration.
\par <#/> To begin with, you have to identify your own skills and business desires. 
<#/>Skills refer to your area of education and training background. <#/>The products you want to offer may be related to these areas. <#/>If you have had any kind of training it is advisable to locate business opportunities related to that particular trai
n
ing since you have developed the expertise in an area of your choice. <#/>What others, like you, are doing also helps to identify business opportunities. <#/>For example, if a friend of yours is a tailor and makes a reasonable profit or, your own sister i
s a successful hairdresser, you may follow suit.
\par <#/> When trying to emulate what others are doing you must be realistic; you must try to match your education and training background to find out if you have the right skills for making the intended business 
a success. <#/>For example, if your expertise is in motor vehicle repair you may not do well as a <-/hotelier>. <#/>Wrong assessment can lead to failure.
\par <#/> A common question asked by those who have had no special training is what business opportunities 
are available for them? The answer to this question is that business opportunities are many and varied. <#/>One can take up retailing like running a grocery kiosk, selling newspapers, house to house selling, running a poultry farm; selling curious, second
 hand dresses, books, or for that matter even selling eggs. <#/>And if you have the necessary capital and/or expertise, manufacturing.
\par <#/> Another important thing to consider is how relevant and desirable to you the area of your choice is. <#/>If you are v
ery much interested in the business you will definitely be highly motivated to do your best. <#/>So before you invest your money and spend a lot of energy on a business enterprise, think seriously whether you like the particular area.
\par <#/> The market situa
tion will also help you to identify business opportunities. <#/>It could be in the village or town where you were born, or in another part of the country. <#/>Studying the local or national market can help you identify good business opportunities. <#/>If 
y
ou are not clear in this exercise you can get help from your friends, relatives or from a specialist consultant. <#/>Finding out what products or services have a ready market can be a great help in identifying business opportunities. <#/>K-MAP can provide
 some useful guidance to this end.
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24 3. MARKET STUDY }{\f0\fs24 </h>
\par <#/> Once you have identified business opportunities you must engage in market study. <#/>This is to analyse the market to find out details about the product or services you want to make or pro
vide. <#/>Details include things like the type of product or service that will have a good demand, product or service mix, and who your potential customers are? Where they are. <#/>What is the quantity you can sell? What will be the acceptable, reasonable
, profitable and appealing prices? How the product or service should be moved to the final consumer, when and where the selling outlets would be made available.
\par <#/> The information you gather from the answers to the above questions will help you decide several things, such as:-
\par <#/>- Whether it is worthwhile to engage in the business line you have identified.
\par <#/>- What materials, tools and equipment - and in what quantities - are required to run the business.
\par <#/>- How much money will be required to start and run the business.
\par <#/>- The sales volume that you will be able to realise.
\par <#/>- The cash flow for a given period of time.
\par <#/>- Profit for a particular period of time.
\par <#/>- The location of the market.
\par <#/>- The strength of the market.
\par <#/>- The best and most effective ways of reaching the market.
\par <#/>- The most satisfying and profitable way of distributing the products/services.
\par <#/>- The right price to charge.
\par <#/>- The right product or service mix.
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24 Marketing }{\f0\fs24 </h>
\par <#/> Before you go into business you should establish whether there is a market for what you want to sell and the nature and extent of that market.
\par <#/> It pays to remember what a market is. <#/>A market is people. <#/>A market comprises of people with income which they are willing to spend on the type of product you intend to produce.
\par <#/> The information you get from the market study (also called market survey or market research) must be used in marketing your product. <#/>It is in your interest to satisf
y market requirements in the business line you have identified, for that is the best way to earn reasonable profit. <#/>This involves the production of the right product, offering of the right service, providing the product or service at the right place a
t the right time, in the right product (service) mix, and finally selling at the right price.
\par <#/> Marketing should also involve adopting the right approach to attract customers, and keep them. <#/>Marketing is very essential if you want to become a successful businessman. <#/>This is more so if you are faced with competition.
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24 4. PLANNING }{\f0\fs24 </h>
\par <#/> Planning is a very important management function. <#/>And to become successful it is very important to remember that you are the one responsible for plann
ing your business. <#/>Whether you are going to start a new enterprise or whether you will continue operating the current business, or expand it, is something that has to be properly planned.
\par <#/> True, you may be able to get advice from others, but it is you to make your business a success. <#/>Thus you have to be seriously involved in its planning.
\par <#/> Planning is how you want to realise what you want to achieve. <#/>If you want to start business you should know things like what quantity you can produce 
or buy for sale within a given period of time, how much it will cost to produce or buy etc. <#/>If you wish to set up a business, decide the type of enterprises and do the following.
\par <#/>- Write down the different items you require.
\par <#/>- Find out the cost and prepare an estimate. <#/>You can call this an expenditure budget. <#/>This is very important and directly affects your preparation of an accurate budget.
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24 The benefits of a good plan/budget }{\f0\fs24 </h>
\par <#/> An accurate budget will help you in many ways:
\par <#/>- It will give you a correct picture of the amount of money you will require to spend in order to start and run the business, or it will show you how much money will be needed to operate the business over a given period of time, like a month.
\par <#/>- It will help you to look for ways and means of raising money or credit.
\par <#/>- It will help you to organise ways and means of cutting losses.
\par <#/>- It will help you to calculate profits over a period of time.
\par }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>table
\par }{\b\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24  It is necessary to prepare an expenditure budget for any kind of business - manufacturing, service or farming.
\par <#/>- Find out how much it will cost to produce one unit or provide one service. <#/>This can be done with the help of a production budget or service operation budget.
\par <#/>- Estimate how many units you can produce within a given period of time under normal circumstances.
\par <#/>- Deliver the products in the most effective way you can.
\par <#/>If you are already in business, do the following:
\par <#/>- Think out what you want your business to bring next year, e.g. Sales Shs. 50,000/-.
\par <#/>- Think and write down the ways you can get this sales volume.
\par <#/>- Think of the cost of getting the sales target.
\par <#/>- Calculate the profit you can earn.
\par <#/>When thinking of the above points, concentrate on the following areas of your business:
\par 1. Sales
\par 2. The direct costs
\par 3. The indirect costs
\par <#/> It is necessary to estimate these three areas as accurately as possible so that you have a clear idea of the profit you are going to earn. <#/>When you have run your business for sometime it is possible to make realistic estimates of future sales.

\par <#/>When you know the three areas well it becomes helpful to:
\par - Estimate the profit you will make
\par - Plan to reduce costs
\par - Plan to raise money when necessary
\par - Plan to do whatever may be necessary to realise the sales target.
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24 5. COSTING <}{\f0\fs24 /h>
\par <#/> Cost
ing is the method you use to calculate how much each product or service costs to produce (or provide) and sell. <#/>It is very necessary for you to know your costs as accurately as possible. <#/>Otherwise you could be selling below cost without knowing; a
nd this would mean making losses, or even ruin of your business.
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24 Benefits of Costing <}{\f0\fs24 /h>
\par <#/>- Helps to set prices
\par <#/>- Helps to find out which inputs are most or least expensive
\par }\pard\plain \s138\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \v\f56\lang2057 {\v0\f0 <#/>- Helps in assessing how well any new strategy to improve your business is working.
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \f56\fs20 {\f0 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 - Helps to adjust profit margins. <#/>This is very important when you are faced with competition.
\par <#/> Before you think of costing one product or one service job, you must calculate the total costs. <#/>In order to do this you must 
keep a record of all the costs. <#/>Book-keeping can help you here. <#/>To know the total costs you must know the different types of costs. <#/>In your business there are two types of costs.
\par <#/>(i) }{\b\f0\fs24 Direct costs:}{\f0\fs24  material cost + labour costs
\par <#/>(ii) }{\b\f0\fs24 Indirect costs:}{\f0\fs24  costs you incur on all the other items in running your business such as building, machines and tools and their maintenance, replacements and repair
\par <#/>Included in indirect costs are also
\par - salaries paid to you and others not directly involved in production
\par - office costs such as telephone, postage and stationery.
\par - Selling costs other than salaries, interests charges and licences etc. <#/>also fall into the indirect costs bracket.
\par <X_>}{\v\f0\fs24 <#/> Note that the more units you produce from the same premises,
 the lower will be the indirect costs per unit of production. <#/>Thus increasing output tends to bring down the total costs per unit of production. <#/>This is called economies of scale. <#/>By lowering your unit costs through the economies of scale you 
can charge lower prices, thus selling more and increasing your total profit.
\par <#/> Accurate and continuous costing is a necessary tool for efficient business management. }{\f0\fs24 </X></I>

\par <#/> Pricing means deciding for how much you want to sell your product. <#/>Correct pricing is very necessary for successful business. <#/>On the other hand, wrong pricing can cause losses or help your competitors to undercut you.
\par <#/> For right pricing you need the following information:-
\par <#/>- Cost of your inputs
\par <#/>- Competitors prices
\par <#/>- How much customers are willing to pay for your kind of product
\par <#/>- How customers evaluate your business. <#/>Do the customers look to your business as providing high quality products or services? Have you been accepted as a market leader in the are
a of your business? In other words have you created a good name or high image as a businessman of integrity?
\par <#/>All these factors affect pricing.
\par <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24 How to price
\par <#/>}{\f0\fs24  The price you set must cover.
\par <#/>Direct costs + Indirect costs + Reasonable profit

\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \f56\fs20 {\b\v\f0\fs24 <&>numbers
\par }{\b\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24  When deciding how much to add as profit you must take into consideration
 all the factors mentioned above as affecting pricing. <#/>You should also know to whom you are going to sell, the quantity you can sell and the terms of payment. <#/>You can sell to three different types of customers.
\par <#/>- Manufacturers
\par <#/>- Distributors
\par <#/>- Final customers
\par <#/> You can understand this well if you can take the above example. <#/>There the pricing was done assuming you are selling direct to the final customers. <#/>But the situation would be different when you want to sell through distr
ibutors. <#/>Here again the channel of distribution your product might pass through in reaching the final customer has to be known well. <#/>You have also to decide if you want to have a control over the final price at which the product should be sold by 
t
he retailer to the final customer. <#/>If you are a manufacturer and have no control over the price at which the retailer will sell the product to the final customer, the price may be too high, resulting in lower sales. <#/>This will affect your business 
negatively. <#/>Thus pricing has to be treated as a very sensitive element in business. <#/>It should be done very realistically, and adjusted continuously in line with changes in market conditions.
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24 7. BUYING AND SELLING }{\f0\fs24 </h>
\par <#/>Buying is common to all business. <#/>Buying is done fore two reasons:
\par <#/>- Buying for use as an input
\par <#/>- Buying for resale at a profit
\par <#/>When buying for use as an input you think of several factors:-
\par <#/>- Whether the material is the right one to make the product of the quality you expect to realise, and costs and amount that ensures you profit given the price you intend to sell your product.
\par <#/>- Whether the tool or equipment is the right one for the purpose.
\par <#/>- If it is for resale, is it the right one in terms of marketing?
\par <#/>- It is also important to know clearly whether you have the facilities to store materials and products that you buy for resale. <#/>If you don't have correct storage facilities materials and products can go bad, leading to loss of money.
\par <#/>- You must also know how to handle the materials and products you buy. <#/>You should know them very well; and if you don't already know, learn them well before buying to avoid unnecessary losses.
\par <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24 Selling
\par <#/>}{\f0\fs24  The purpose of selling is to satisfy customer requirements and make a profit. <#/>The more you sell the greater will be the profit.
\par <#/>To sell well you must:-
\par <#/>- Know your customers well.
\par <#/>- Produce or have goods of the quality they are looking for.
\par <#/>- Charge appropriate prices that are affordable to them and at the same time give you a reasonable profit.
\par <#/> Selling must be made very seriously. <#/>You must remember the money you have invested in your business comes back with a profit only when y
ou sell, up to that moment your money is tied up in stocks. <#/>Actual progress in business starts when a sale has been made. <#/>Everything must be done to sell as much as possible at the earliest possible time. <#/>Treat your prospects and customers wel
l
, answer their questions well and happily, learn to explain the benefits of what you sell, especially when comparing your product or service with those of the competitors. <#/>Above all, establish a high image for your business and yourself so that custom
ers develop confidence in your product or service.
\par <#/>  Selling must be treated as the most important activity in your business. <#/>There is a famous saying which goes something like: "Trust the world, nothing happens until a sale is made". <#/>The practi
ce of effective salesmanship is very essential for success in business, especially amongst growing competition. <#/>Effective salesmanship needs you to treat the customer as KING or the most important person for your business. <#/>This approach will inclu
de you to adopt customer satisfying behaviour in selling.
\par 
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24 8. STOCK CONTROL <}{\f0\fs24 /h>
\par <#/> Stock control is to have a continuous check on the number and type of materials, parts and goods in your business. <#/>Good stock control is very essential for con
tinued production, and sale of goods and services. <#/>It helps you avoid shortages that could disrupt your business. <#/>It also helps you to avoid too much stocking that could tie up money unnecessarily leading to losses.
\par <#/> Your business could run out of stock and suffer due to many reasons:
\par <#/>- You have ordered too late
\par <#/>- You have forgotten to order materials, parts or goods to replace those you have used or sold.
\par <#/>- You have not found out the correct re-order level of materials and goods.
\par <#/> Running out of stock can create a lot of problems:
\par <#/>* can stop production, and this could throw you out of business.
\par <#/>* can cause dissatisfaction to your customers and they may go to your competitors, never to come back.
\par <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24 How to control stock effectively
\par <#/>}{\f0\fs24 - Check your stock regularly
\par <#/>- Note carefully the materials and parts you use fast and those used occasionally. <#/>If you are only selling note, goods which get sold fast and those which are slow selling. <#/>Restock accordingly.
\par <#/>- Arrange the stocks in such a way that you can see and collect them easily.
\par <#/>- Group the items separate into sets for easy identification and selection.
\par <#/>- Maintain a clear record of the stock you are carrying.
\par <#/> Mr. Small Businessman since you nor
mally stock few items it is easy for you to have a written record. <#/>It is easy to check. <#/>Never depend on memory since you can forget This record is called a Bin Card. <#/>Here you write the details of the items - price, date, particulars, stock bal
ance. <#/>This helps you to have a very clear idea of the stock situation and when you should re-order.
\par 
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24 9. BOOK-KEEPING <}{\f0\fs24 /h>
\par <#/> When you start a business, or you have been running the business for some time, you may seriously think of buying raw 
materials, producing goods or offering services, buying and selling of goods etc. <#/>but you may not think seriously about book-keeping and accounts. <#/>It may be due to your belief that raw materials, machines, tools, or buying and selling of goods bri
ng profits, or help run the business, while book-keeping and accounts cannot earn money.
\par <#/> You may argue that it is the production of goods or providing of services and their sale that earn profit and it is wise to concentrate on such areas. <#/>Such arg
uments reveal wrong understanding of book keeping and accounts. <#/>The purpose of book-keeping and accounts is to help you run your business more efficiently and earn good profits or avoid losses by not making wrong decisions. <#/>Book-keeping is recordi
n
g what money you have received, how much money you have spent and how you have spent the money. <#/>It is necessary to write down all information in all the three areas. <#/>It is book-keeping that will help you here. <#/>You may think that you can rememb
er all the information. <#/>But it is not possible for managing your business successfully, find time to record all financial transactions of your business. <#/>Record keeping needs two types of books.
\par - Ledger
\par - Subsidiary books e.g. Cash Book, etc.
\par <#/> L
edger is the main book used to record and enter all figures arising from your business transactions. <#/>It shows how much money goes out and where. <#/>The ledger is usually divided into three sections: sales ledger, purchase ledger and general ledger. <
#/>Maintaining a good book-keeping system is not difficult. <#/>If you can write and know to add, subtract, divide and multiply you can learn book-keeping. <#/>Good motivation is of course essential.
\par <#/> Accounts will help you to understand information giv
en in a balance sheet and profit and loss accounts. <#/>You will be able to know how the figures have been worked out through book-keeping. <#/>You can identify the intentional and unintentional mistakes done by book-keeping, and use of management account
ing and financial management also will help you run your business efficiently. <#/>So learn them well and make them help you earn good profits.
\par 
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24 10. BUSINESS PROMOTION<}{\f0\fs24 /h>
\par <#/> Business promotion means to do everything that will help to get sales. <#/>Promotion is necessary for any business, especially small business. <#/>It is necessary to get back with a profit what you have invested - money and labour - as quickly as pos
sible.
\par <#/> Promotion helps people to know what you have for sale, and why they should buy your goods or services in preference to those of competitors. <#/>You can do a number of things to promote your business:-
\par <#/>1. Design a poster and display it at the entrance to your workshop or shop.
\par <#/>2. Tell everybody whom you contact about your business.
\par <#/>3. Request your customers to tell others the quality and benefits of your products or services.
\par <#/>4. Make a display of your goods and/or services.
\par <#/>5. Prepare a simple but good hand bill about what you have for sale and distribute this among your customers.
\par <#/>6. Prepare special posters and display them in places where people gather, such as churches, schools, markets, etc.
\par <#/>7. Request your customers, to bring their relatives, friends, etc. <#/>to your shop or service centre.
\par <#/>8. Give discounts to regular customers and customers who buy above a certain amount.
\par <#/>9. Make your business popular by producing quality goods and/or services; never cheat your customers for quick money.
\par <#/>10. Develop customer relations by participating in community activities in your area. <#/>This will help you to establish good relations with people in your area and help you to sell your goods or service more easily.
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24 11. BUSINESS IS PEOPLE }{\f0\fs24 </h>
\par <#/> It is very important for you to have good relations with your customers and prospects. <#/>You buy from people and you sell to people. <#/>So, people are your greatest assets. <#/>You must remember this always: do e
verything to keep your customer and prospects satisfied.
\par <#/> Treat your customer as the most important person for you business. <#/>Customers are the heart of your business. <#/>If they stop buying from you, your business comes to an end.
\par <#/>What can you do to keep your customers happy?
\par <#/>1. Know your business well; nothing sells like your ability to give full information about your business. <#/>It is especially important that your customers know the benefit of your products or services, and the advant
age of buying from you, and even associating with you.
\par <#/>2. Be sincere always. <#/>Trustworthiness helps to impress customers and prospects. <#/>In fact many businesses fail due to lack of this quality. <#/>Honesty helps to create faith in you. <#/>This 
brings good business and helps you to become prosperous. <#/>Cheating, on the contrary, destroys confidence. <#/>Cheating to make quick money makes you unpopular and can cause customers to withdraw from you, and even lead to the collapse of your business.

\par <#/>3. Charge fair prices. <#/>Reasonable pricing helps you attract more and more customers. <#/>If your prices are too high customers will run away from you, and if there is stiff competition you will soon lose the business. <#/>It is very helpful if you
 can tell your customers why you charge a particular price. <#/>People become happy to know that they get value for their money. </I>

For example, 'I'm writing to EAI because I've been impressed with the way the company has grown locally in the past few years....' It may seem a bit pretentious, but its better than showing no interest whatsoever!
\par <#/>Don't ramble, make excuses or apologise for writing.
\par <#/>Don't beg for a job - remember you're selling your skills. <#/>On the other hand, don't pigeon hole yourself too much . <#/>If you specify a particular job title you may cut off other opportunities.
\par <#/>Don't enclose a lengthy CV. <#/>Its best to summarise your experience briefly in your letter.

\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \f56\fs20 {\f0 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 CVs often end up in one of three piles. <#/>Definates, Possibles, and Bin Jobs. <#/>Here are five ways to ensure yours ends up in the bin.
\par <#/>1. Handwrite it
\par <#/>2. Make spelling and grammar mistakes and an asterisked apology for the coffee stains.
\par <#/>3. Tell lies
\par <#/>4. Use coloured/Scented/Flower edged paper as opposed to plain white A4.
\par <#/>5. Draw attention to all the things you're trying to mention, like 'I realize I am older than the age specified in your advertisement'.
\par <#/>Don't bother with
 expensive folders. <#/>Staple the pages neatly and pop into a clear A4 folder and do not forget to keep a copy. <#/>Also remember, first impressions are vital, never send a CV that has been altered in any way by hand. <#/>And bear in mind you may need to
 tailor-make your CV for each job. <#/>If you had a mad two-week fling as a teacher and you're applying for a job as a teacher, then mention it. <#/>Otherwise, think twice!
\par }\pard\plain \s4\qj\keepn\nowidctlpar\outlinelevel3\adjustright \i\f56\lang2057 {\f0 <#/>What to include on your CV
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \f56\fs20 {\f0 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Start with Personal Details. <#/>Name, address, telephone number, date of birth.
\par <#/>Next should come Education and Professional Qualifications. <#/>Prospective employers definitely won't want to know about your primary school education. <#/>Give the subjects of your O-Level passes (unless you took them 
decades ago) but only itemise the grades if they are mainly As and Bs. <#/>State the subjects and grades of A-levels plus details of any other further education; secretarial qualifications, university degree and so on.
\par <#/>Then should come your Career Hist
ory. <#/>You should include dates, the company name, your job title and the main areas of responsibility. <#/>Supply more detailed information for your most recent job. <#/>When describing exactly what you did in each job use positive wording, such as 'I'
 initiated...'I organised...I was responsible for...'
\par <#/>Make every sentence work for you. <#/>Ask yourself what you could add to make your point even more eye catching
\par <#/>For example, instead of just saying, 'I planned and implemented a new system for our customer', perhaps you could add 'which resulted in annual savings for the company of Kshs. 100,000'.
\par <#/>Don't lie, but there's no need to be scrupulously honest either. <#/>For example don't change an old job title from 'typist' to 'supervisor' if the 
nearest you came to managing staff was feeding the office cat. <#/>Your sins will almost certainly find you out.
\par <#/>Don't reveal your previous salary unless specifically asked to do so. <#/>It might be far more than they're willing to pay - far less! Don'
t volunteer the reasons why you left each job unless specifically asked to. <#/>Mention the words 'personality clash' anywhere and you might just as well turn up to the interview (if you get that far!) wearing a Here comes Trouble T-Shirt.
\par <#/>Now add a se
ction of other achievements. <#/>In this section you might include any awards you've won, any responsible posts held outside work, any courses undertaken, proficiency at languages, sporting achievements. <#/>In this section you might include any awards yo
u've won, any responsible posts held outside work, any courses undertaken, proficiency at languages, sporting achievements and so on.
\par <#/>Add a short section about Leisure interests. <#/>Make sure your list is balanced and interesting! If you are trying to 
get a job as a classified ads salesperson, then you will hardly make an impression by putting train spotting and stamp collection on your list. <#/>On the other hand, if you state travelling and rock climbing and scuba diving, they might worry you're too 
high a risk. <#/>Remember, everything on your CV will say something about you as a person.
\par <#/>Finally list your Referees. <#/>At least one previous employer and one character referee will look good. <#/>An aunty won't do.

\par <#/>Why have you changed jobs so often?

\par <#/>What not to say: Yes, I used to be a bit sensitive in those days/I always seemed to have a personality clash with my boss.
\par <#/>You have two young children. <#/>Does that mean you will need to take time off when they're sick?
\par <#/>What to say: I already have well-established childcare with reliable back-up and I consider it unprofessional to take time off work unless absolutely necessary.
\par <#/>What not to say: Well, they only get the usual childhood illnesses. <#/>I don't have to take off more than a couple of days a month.
\par <#/>Don't you think you are over qualified for this job?
\par <#/>What to say: I think that the experience I have gained could be very valuable to the company, but I still have a lot to learn and I'm anxious to make a new start in a company like this.
\par <#/>What not to say: Well, I suppose I am really, but I don't mind slumming it.
\par <#/>Don't you think you are a bit under qualified for this job?
\par <#/>What to say: I feel the experience I've gained so far has equipped me to do this job well and I know I have the confidence to carry it through. <#/>But I'd be prepared to study or take on extra work if you felt I needed to capitalize on that.

\par <h> <#/>JUSTIFICATION FOR DEPARTMENTAL STATUS}{\f0\fs24  </h>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
\par <#/>Our justification for change of status from Library Education Unit to Department of Library and Information Studies is as follows:
\par <#/>The Library Education Unit which has been in existence in this University for a period of over 12 years, having been established in 1984/85 academic year, has now come of age and deserves to be up-graded to a full-fledged department. <#/>All these yea
rs it has been successfully nurtured by the University Library and time has now come for it to stand on its own as an independent department within the Faculty of Education.
\par <#/>On inception in 1984, the following two programmes were offered on the request to the Ministry of Education
\par <#/>- M.Ed (T.D.C.)
\par <#/>- M.Ed (P.T.E.)
\par <#/>Currently, the Unit is offering the following programmes:
\par <#/>- M.Ed. (Library Studies)
\par <#/>- B.Ed. (Library Studies)
\par <#/>These two programmes have a total of 117 students, 7 of whom are postgraduates while 110 are undergraduates.
\par <#/>There are 4 postgraduate students in year 2, and 3 in year 1, 20 undergraduates in year 4, 24 in year 3, 44 in year 2, and 22 in year 1.
\par <#/>It is <-/worthnoting> that the demand for these programmes is rising every year. <#/>Since 
\par <#/>1990, 29 graduates have gone through the M.Ed (Library Studies) programme and all of them 
\par <#/>are holding responsible positions in various information organizations throughout the country.
\par <#/>The first lot of 22 B.Ed (Lib
rary Studies) students graduated in 1995 and are now working in various organizations including teacher training colleges as library science tutors and managers of learning resource centres, specialized professional training institutions, and even in non-
governmental organizations.
\par <#/>We may also add that the two programmes offered by the Unit are not offered anywhere else in the country and their graduates are certainly making a positive impact on the library and information scene in the country.
\par <h> <#/>RATIONALE}{\f0\fs24  </h>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
\par <#/>School Librarianship has been taught in Kenyatta University since 1976/77 when it was offered as an elective course to the Diploma students. <#/>More recently a Librarianship course was introduced into the M.Ed. (TDC) and M.Ed. (PTE) programmes.

\par <#/>In this programme the introduction of Librarianship as a subject within the B.Ed.is meant to serve the following purposes.
\par <#/>1. To produce a teacher/librarian who can not only teach an academic subject but also organize school libraries. <#/
>At present a lot of schools do not have anybody from among the staff who can organise their libraries professionally. <#/>Because of this, schools buy books every year which are inadequate in number and gets lost due to lack of proper organization.

\par <#/>2. To produce a person with the prerequisite skills who can also be absorbed into the current Teachers Service Commission scales.
