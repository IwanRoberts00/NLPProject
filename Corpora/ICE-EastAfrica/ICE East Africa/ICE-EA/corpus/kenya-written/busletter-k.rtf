\par <#/>RE: SECOND MOMBASA & COASTAL WATER SUPPLY ENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
\par 
\par <#/>By your letter MCS2/WW/4/(90) dated 27th November, 1995, you made an offer to SOGEA for the award of the above Contract, subject to a number of co
nditions. <#/>One such condition was that the "clarifications" regarding contractual provisions which were in the tender would be subject to discussion, and the Employer's decision on these clarifications would be binding.
\par 
\par <#/>We have had a meeting with t
he Contractor on these clarifications, and enclose a copy of the minutes of the meeting and a copy of the clarifications in the tender. <#/>You will note that out of 13 items, the Contractor agreed to drop all but four of them.
\par 
\par <#/>These remaining items are in areas where we recommend that amendment of the terms of the Contract would be both equitable and appropriate. <#/>These changes would have the following effects:
\par 
\par <#/>i) variations which would result in exceeding the Contract Price by more than 10% would have the prior concurrence of the World Bank (this would avoid problems with subsequent processing payments),
\par 
\par <#/>ii) instead of retention money being held, the Contractor would provide a bank guarantee,
\par 
\par <#/>iii) the Advance Payment would be paid with 56 days of signing of the Contract and provision by the Contractor of the performance and advance payment securities, and
\par 
\par <#/>iv) comments on the draft final valuation of the Works submitted by the Contractor to be given within 28 days.
\par 
\par <#/>We therefore enclose herewith a draft letter to the Contractor, which you may issue if you concur with our recommendations.
\par 
\par <#/>It may be pointed out that the Contract will only come into effect once the Contractor accepts the offer of the award. <#/>The Contractor cannot do so until the clarifications are ruled upon.
\par 
\par <#/>We would therefore urge that this matter be given your most expeditious attention.

\par <I> <#/<Any organization involved in development work needs electric power.
\par 
\par <#/>Usually, these activities are carried on in remote, rural areas where there is no access to the mains grid.
\par <#/>Kenital Ltd. has been supplying and servicing over 2,000 solar systems in the Eastern African region over the past 10 years.
\par <#/>Solar is a clean, reliable and durable technology. <#/>Although it requires a high capital investment, this will pay off in 5-7 years due to a next-to-zero maintenance and running costs.
\par <#/>For developing projects, not only the very low maintenance and running costs but also the very easy to function features of thes
e systems (actually, they hardly need any human intervention) makes solar technology the most suitable, since they also avoid burdening the local community with future problems and expenses to get fuel, spare parts, etc..., and keep them serviced for as l
ong as over 25 years (expected lifespan of our system).
\par <#/>If you already have a generator, a hybrid system (solar plus generator) will dramatically reduce the generator running time (<-/tipically> to 1-2 hours per day).
\par <#/>We will be pleased to meet with you for further discussion on the most suitable systems to meet your specific needs on lighting, refrigeration, hot water, water pumping and communication (radio-transmitters).
\par <#/>Please, do not hesitate to contact us for any enquiry or further information you might need on our solar system.

\par <#/>}{\fs24\ul THE FAST TRACK TO SUCCESS FOR PROFESSIONAL ASTUTE BUYERS
\par }{\b\fs24 <#/>}{\b\v\fs24 <+_the>}{\fs24  Liberalisation of the Kenyan economy is the best thing that happened to Kenya in 1994. <#/>So most people say. <#/>It has brought opportunities to individuals, companies, institutions and
 organizations a chance to source goods and services competitively.
\par <#/>It has also opened the same companies and organizations to a very competitive market environment. <#/>A saving of whatever nature or kind is now very vital to those keen on succeeding and attain }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  growth.
\par <#/>Those running companies, institutions or organizations are working out strategies in the face of an uncertain economy, intensified competition, changing consumer attitudes, shifting fiscal policies, expensive and scarce f
inancial resources, corruption, etc. <#/>Today's market place creates unprecedented opportunities for astute buyers who are able to act now and survive.
\par <#/>Some people believe the best way to keep up with the challenge and competition is to go with the sy
stem everyone else has. <#/>Others think that just keeping up isn't good enough. <#/>They are looking for ways to get ahead and are rethinking the conventional way of doing business directly with established dealerships whose level of discounting is based
 on volume and must be requested. <#/>New devices are being sought.
\par <#/>TECO COMMODITIES are trading agents. <#/>We seek the best prices for our clients from competing local companies or dealerships of well-known Japanese, European, American, Asian and Keny
an Commodity brands. <#/>We obtain the best quotations possible for approval by our clients.
\par <#/>Clients are invoiced, through us, directly by the suppliers. <#/>Payment is made either direct to the suppliers or through us. <#/>No fee is paid to us by clients. <#/>A minimal service charge is paid to us by the suppliers upon conclusion of a sale.

\par <#/>Our clients include NGOs. Donor agencies, Institutions, Companies and individuals. <#/>Due to many clients }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 , our purchase volume for any commodity is
 high with our suppliers. <#/>Consequently, our bargaining power is unmatched and our clients enjoy the best discounts possible even when one item is required.

\par <I> <#/>Dear Sir,
\par <#/>As you may be aware, the Port Management Association of Eastern and Southern Africa was established in 1973 under the auspices of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, following a recommendation made by the Confere
nce of Ministers responsible for transport in Africa, at a meeting held in Tunis in 1971.
\par 
\par <#/>Currently, it has fourteen full members, namely:

\par Ethiopia
\par Kenya
\par Madagascar
\par Malawi
\par Mauritius
\par Mozambique
\par Seychelles
\par Somalia
\par Sudan
\par Tanzania
\par Zambia and
\par Zimbabwe
\par <#/>Its main objectives are, inter alia, to promote, co-ordinate and standardize port operations and services with a view to increasing port efficiency at the national and regional levels and to provide a forum where all members can address an
d find solutions to common problems facing African ports.
\par <#/>I assumed duty as full-time Secretary General of the Association at its Secretariat in Mombasa on 7th January, 1993.
\par <#/>The Association is in the process of establishing a data bank at its Secretariat, which will assist all the member ports in:
\par - Providing port information to all users and other organizations
\par - Co-ordinating sub-regional efforts in provision of improved traffic flow
\par - Carrying out studies and research
\par - Creating expertise in member ports for the collection and analysis of data for the operational needs of the port.
\par <#/>Our Association has obtained technical assistance from the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa in the preparation of a proposa

\par <#/>The story given by your Mombasa manager, is completely untrue. <#/>Ask him, was he in the office on the day of 17th Feb? <#/> When did he inform us for this episode? <#/> Not on Monday morning. <#/>
We phoned your airport office at about 0800 hours, the incharge-officer first of all did not have any information about this shipment going on GF714/17th Feb, is this not surprising! <#/> Nobody bothered to keep your airport office informed. <#/>We were t
old on Sunday that, they have been informed by MSA office to keep the stuff in cold room. <#/>Was this our authority?
\par 
\par <#/>This matter is very serious and we do not want to discuss through exchange of correspondences. <#/>If this shipment was not possible t
o connect the Gulfair flight at 1330 hours, then your man should not have allowed to let the goods go to Nairobi without any reason in a hope to reship on another flight, in case of failing on this booked flight.
\par 
\par <#/>We still emphasise that the negligence
 was on part of your Mombasa office and they should suffer the loss and not we. <#/>Once we have handed over our consignment to your people at the airport and already weighed then our responsibility is over. <#/>Then how to plan to send on which flight in
 order to get good connection for connecting flight and keep informed your Nairobi office. <#/>It is your responsibility not ours. <#/>We understand, we are clear here on this matter.
\par 
\par <#/>For your information, our last shipment was 17th February, and due t
o IDD holidays start on 19th February, our clients in Middle East instructed us not to ship anything as every shop will be closed till 23rd February. <#/>We did not make any booking with you after the 17th Feb, and we clearly told your Mr. <name/> to canc
e
l if any on 19th February, and he should be clear on this issue. <#/>You man called us on the morning of 19th to ship above left out cargo on this day Gulfair to Abudhabi, which we refused as who will clear the shipment as our client was in celebration of
 
IDD. <#/> <-/Infact>, we also cancelled the space of 2500 KGS on KQ310/19th Feb, for Dubai and no booking on Wednesday 21st February. <#/><-/Infact>, we are the party to come into agreement with KQ to allocate us regular space on their 2 flights weekly to
 
Dubai from here. <#/>After frequent offloads on these flights at Nairobi and you know, we had suffered lot during December, inspite of paying 10c extra from here we regularly ship on these flights and we passed on this business to your Mombasa office. <#/
>This was our effort.
\par 
\par <#/>Being very clear and honest, we will not agree to any suffering on this matter and we hope you would <-/justifically> stand on our side. <#/>We personally do not protest nor harm anybody in your organisation with whom we have been
 enjoying good services and facility, with high respect and we pledge to continue in future.
\par 
\par <#/>For your information, from next season we will be expanding our this industry of horticulture trade - as my 2nd son Sameer will be joining with us in Septembe
r, after finishing his diploma in horticultural at Warwickshire, U.K.. <#/>We will be Insha-Alllah with strong force of university agronomist to expand our force.
\par

\par \tab <#/>}{\fs24\ul OF THE JOINT FIDA/ICJ ELECTION MONITORING UNIT}{\fs24 
\par 
\par <#/>The International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA), Kenya Chapter, and the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), Kenya Section, have established an independent Election Monitoring Unit in anticipation of the forthcoming multi-party General Elec
tion.
\par 
\par <#/>The short term objectives of the Election Monitoring Unit are: (a) to train a cross-section of lawyers, church officials, human rights activists, students and other groups to monitor the elections; (b) to ensure that the voters are well versed in
 the correct electoral procedures and their voting rights, and (c) to monitor the forthcoming elections at all the stages of the electoral process and ensure that it is fair to all political parties, and indeed all electors and that any attempt at rigging
 or other forms of electoral misconduct are noted and reported.
\par 
\par <#/>The long term objective is to seek legitimacy and support for an independent election monitoring unit, to elaborate on its composition and functions, structure and role in subsequent elect
ions. <#/>Hopefully, the FIDA/ICJ undertaking will introduce a local initiative to ultimately install and justify the need for a permanent independent electoral commission.
\par 
\par <#/>In order to establish our bona fides as well as to have our intentions known t
o the relevant authorities, we have sent out letters to the Attorney-General, the Chairman of the Electoral Commission, and the Secretaries - General of the political parties.
\par 
\par <#/>The first step towards the above objectives is to seek co-operation, suppor
t and endorsement all - round, and especially from those actively involved in the electoral process including the electorate. <#/>To achieve this, a group of prominent and respected citizens have been invited by the Joint FIDA/ICJ Executive Committee to f
orm a Lobby Group to articulate the need to put in place the necessary enabling legal environment for the holding of free and fair elections.
\par 
\par <#/>There is need, for example, to publicize those crucial areas of our legal system which require immediate atten
tion so as to make the transition to multi-party politics genuine and meaningful. <#/>This will be accomplished by, amongst other things, a one-day workshop to be held in Nairobi. <#/>At the workshop, two major discussion papers on the various factors whi
c
h go towards ensuring the holding of free and fair elections will be presented by knowledgeable people in this field. <#/>Representatives from all registered political parties, religious organisations, NGOs, pressure groups and grassroots movements have b
een invited to participate in the workshop.
\par 
\par <#/>To achieve the above objectives, the Joint Executive Committee has organised a Lobby Group Workshop to be held at the Safari Park Hotel Nairobi, on Friday August 14, 1992 Nairobi, stating at 9.00 a. m. to whi
ch you are kindly invited to attend or send a representative }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 .

\par 
\par <#/>We refer to our recent letter inviting you to participate in the above captioned workshop.
\par 
\par <#/>We regret to inform you that it has become necessary to re-schedule the dates from 25th - 27th August to <-/sometime> in October, 1994. <#/>This has become 
necessary after it transpired that both the Attorney-General and the Chief Justice will be out of the country for most of the latter part of this month.
\par 
\par <#/>When we called on the Attorney-General on 8th August, 1994 he informed us that his diary was full 
up to 12th October and that thereafter he will be able to participate in our workshop. <#/>Accordingly, Mr Amos Wako suggested that we also obtain confirmation from the Chief Justice that he will also be available then. <#/>This we are in the process of o
btaining.
\par 
\par <#/>We consider the participation of both the Attorney-General and the Chief Justice as crucially important as the three workshops under the rubric }{\fs24\ul The Administration of Criminal Justice }{\fs24 
are premised on the valid point that it is important to involve all the major players in this area who include the prosecution personnel, the judiciary and representatives from the law enforcement agencies.
\par 
\par <#/>We regret the inconvenience caused by the postponement of the forthcoming workshop but hope you will understand. <#/>We will immediately inform you about the new dates once these are determined.

\par <#/>TO: ALL SENATE MEMBERS
\par <#/>ATTENDANCE OF SENATE SUB-COMMITTEES
\par <#/>I have received a report to the effect that some Senate Members do not attend Senate Sub-Committees necessitating a record of no quorum. <#/>This has affected the proceedings of such important Committees as the Promotions and Appraisals Committee.

\par <#/>The purpose of this memo is to make an appeal to all Senators who have been elected or nominated to Senate Sub-Commit
tees to attend all the meetings of these Committees. <#/>The success of the Senate depends a great deal an the work done by the Committees.
\par <#/>I have directed that the meetings of Senate Sub-Committees and other Committees in the University should be run 
in a business-like manner. <#/>They should start on time; and documentation should be accurate and to the point; and they should take short time. <#/>If we can do this then we shall all enjoy our meetings and move the business of the University forward.
