 people. <#/>For those conditions which have been shown to be amenable to indigenous treatment, cosmopolitan medicine may not be readily used. <#/>For conditions which are seen to be better treated using cosmopolitan methods, for example those requiring s
u
rgery with anaesthesia, indigenous practices are readily discarded. <#/>The most common situation, however, is that which requires the utilization of both indigenous and cosmopolitan services in a complementary fashion. <#/>Various indigenous health pract
i
ces, both curative and preventive, will be discussed with a view to showing that some may be useful, others harmful and still others neither useful nor harmful. <#/>Understanding this distinction is critical in the attempt to utilize indigenous resources 
in health development. <#/>In this chapter, useful indigenous practices are discussed while in the next some negative practices are considered. 
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \f56\fs20 {<h> <#/>}{\b\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Curative services}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  </h>
\par <#/>Through trial and error, indigenous communities discover and adopt practices which are efficacious in the management of different illnesses. <#/>Examples of such practices existing among Abagusii and Marakwet are presented here.
\par <#/>Herbal therapies of various kinds are effective in the management of indigestion problems, worms
 and cuts in both communities. <#/>The exact efficacy of the herbs is difficult to assess since some of it may be due to the placebo effect. <#/>Marakwet use herbal mixtures to prevent cuts and wounds from becoming septic. <#/>The herbs seem to work very 
well. <#/>There are, however, several serious problems pertaining to dosage, preservation and poisoning in the use of herbs. <#/>These issues are not dealt with effectively in indigenous medicine because of the few technological options available.
\par <#/>Child
 delivery with the assistance of TBAs is another positive practice common among both the Abagusii and Marakwet. <#/>Even where the delivery itself occurs in a hospital setting, the mother receives the bulk of her prenatal and postpartum care from TBAs. <#
/
>TBAs have a very good understanding of the birth process and, where they have received appropriate retraining, are able to refer clients with problems to the relevant specialists. <#/>The TBAs provide the psychological support and counselling which are n
o
t always available in cosmopolitan health facilities. <#/>Retrained TBAs can identify anaemia and other complications and provide relevant advice. <#/>The TBAs, however, still face a number of problems such as the lack of basic instruments with which to m
onitor the mother's blood pressure and foetal condition. <#/>There is also the common problem of infection developing from the use of contaminated materials and instruments.
\par <#/>Psychological support is a useful element in indigenous health practice, especially in the management of chronic conditions.
\par <#/>The Marakwet carry out a number of psychosocial procedures aimed at enhancing individual or community health or preventing illness. <#/>Some are also aimed at treating existing illnesses. <#/>Such practice 
is based on their broad conceptualization of health and the causation of illness. <#/>A number of rituals, <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 ayebisio}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  (pl.), are performed to achieve one or more of the three purposes mentioned earlier\emdash 
reinforcement, prevention and treatment.
\par <#/>The commonest <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 ayeba}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  is that performed when it is thought that the patient or his family are in some way responsible for an illness, for example, through theft, abusing others or quarrelling. <#/>The <ea/>
}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 ayeba}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  performed in such a case involves a prayer for the family conducted by elders. <#/>After prayers to <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Asis}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
, the elders bless the sick person by covering him with green leaves, a symbol of life for Marakwet. <#/>The ceremony is cathartic.
\par <#/>Other <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 ayebisio}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  are performed to enhance health in gen
eral. <#/>This happens when an individual thinks that because of past behaviour he is not liked by other community members. <#/>The condition of unpopularity is believed to exacerbate even minor ailments so the appropriate <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 ayeba
}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  has to be performed.
\par <#/>Another type of psychosocial procedure carried out by Marekwet is called <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 lyopso}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 . <#/><ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Lyopso}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 is a cleansing ceremony aimed at preventing interpersonal and ritual forces from affecting an individual's health. 
\par <#/>Among Marakwet, ritual impurity is believed to be brought about by types of homicide or a ritual oath, <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 muma}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>If a person has committed homicide or sworn a ritual oath falsely, he needs <ea/>}{
\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 lyopso}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  to cleanse his impurity.
\par <#/>Among Abagusii, various rituals and ceremonies are performed to heal patients whose illnesses are thought to involve interpersonal and/or spiritual forces. <#/>The ritual that is most commonly performed among Abagusii is <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 
ekeng'wanso}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 , literally, sacrifice. <#/><ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Ekeng'wanso}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  is performed both to cure and to prevent illness.
\par <#/>All these rituals are performed to relieve the people involved from fears and to restore the confidence and courage needed to face life's challenges. <#/>Such procedures have one major common feature\emdash they are performed by and fo
r the group, the community. <#/>This feature reveals the communal nature of illness as perceived in the African setting.
\par <#/>Traditionally, Abagusii believe that <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 ekeng'wanso}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  is essential for good health to prevail and for the prevention of all sorts of calamities. <#/>The <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 ekeng'wanso}{
\f0\fs24\lang2057  is offered to }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Engoro}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 , creator, and <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 chisokoro}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 , ancestors. <#/>Basically, <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 ekeng'wanso}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 involves the killing of an animal of prescribed colour, age and sex. <#/>The meat is consumed by kin members and sometimes close friends are invited. <#/>The performance of <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 ekeng'wanso}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 does not usually require the presence of a specialist. <#/>Any adult household head can lead the performance of <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 ekeng'wanso}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>The ceremony provides the occasion where past quarrels,
 unpaid debts, dishonoured oaths and other interpersonal problems are discussed. <#/>The ceremony is aimed at healing existing illnesses and preventing others from occurring. <#/>Treatment with materia medica precedes <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 
ekeng'wanso}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  and continues after it where necessary.
\par <#/><ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Ogoosia}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  is another ceremony performed by Abagusii in their health seeking process. <#/><ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Ogoosia}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 means literally "to cool down". <#/>The ceremony is performed when it is suspected that somebody with malicious intent is afflic
ting a family member by exacerbating what would otherwise be a simple illness. <#/>The ceremony involves the killing of a sheep and the use of leaves and flowers to bless the afflicted person. <#/>Kin and neighbours attend and appropriate songs are sung. 
<#/>An appeal is made anonymously but pub\-licly to the individual who may be causing the affliction to stop his malice.
\par <#/><ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Ogokorerana}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  is a ceremony performed when several misfortunes including, but not restricted to, illness, strike a family and it proves difficult to apportion responsibility. <#/><ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 
Ogokorerana}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  is prescribed by a diviner and he may be present to direct the performance. <#/>The ceremony takes various forms and involves the eating of a meal in which family members and neighbours participate. <#/><ea/>}{
\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Ogokorerana}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  is a prayer to the ancestors to protect the family from misfortune and illnesses in particular.
\par <#/>Among families which no longer believe in the efficacy of traditional rituals and ceremonies, Christian fellowships and prayer
s replace the traditional forms. <#/>The multi-faceted causation of illness, requiring multi-dimensional therapy, is fully understood and accepted. <#/>In a number of instances, there is a quasi-Christian performance with traditional trappings. <#/>This i
s true especially among Abagusii, many of whom profess one or another form of Christianity.

\par <#/>Some scholars have erroneously portrayed non-western indigenous societies as lacking an understanding of both the concept and practice of prevention. <#/>This portrayal seems to be due to a superficial study of indigenous medical systems
, even before these came into contact with western civilizations. <#/>Studies in several Kenyan communities have shown that traditionally all these societies believed that certain diseases could be prevented while others could not. <#/>Belief in the possi
bility of preventing illness led to a number of practices aimed at achieving this objective. <#/>These involved the use of both materia medica and appropriate ceremonies or rituals.
\par <#/>The Kikuyu, for example, believed a wide range of procedures and prohibitions to be essential for the prevention of illness. <#/>In cases where an individual was believed to be suffering from an infectious illness such as <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057

\par <#/>To prevent the interpersonal and spiritual aspects of illness, Abagusii use a process called <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 ogokireka omochie}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 , "protecting the homestead". <#/>The process involves spraying the homestead with <ea/>}{

\par <#/><ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Ogotakera}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  is anot
her procedure which Abagusii use to protect a baby from harmful interpersonal or spiritual agencies. <#/>If a baby is sickly and seems threatened by death, the mother and a group of elderly ladies take the baby to a cross-roads point, and lay him by the r

ad side. <#/>Anybody passing through the place has to pray for the baby's good health and survival. <#/>The prayer and well wishes are accompanied with the presenting of gifts to the baby. <#/>The gifts may not have material value but are believed to show
 that the giver wholeheartedly wishes that the baby be protected by God from all kinds of illness. <#/><eaf>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Ogotakera}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 is completed by a prayer said at sunrise by the baby's mother. <#/>The mother holds the baby towards the rising sun and says "<ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Erioba onderere}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 " which means "Sun (God), rear this baby for me". <#/>
\par <#/>Due to the spread of Christianity and western ideas, these procedures may not be acceptable to all members of a given community. <#/>Some members, because of Christianity or the wish to appe

\par <#/>A number of positive health practices exist among Kenyan societies. <#/>Practices such as the use of herbal treatment, psychosocial support and indigenous child delivery need to be studied in detail with a view to encouraging those which are useful.

\par <#/>Concern for effective indigenous health practices will go a long way in facilitating more effective use of cosmopolitan medicine. <#/>Kenya's 1989-1993 Development Plan calls for more research
 to collect information on appropriate traditional diagnostic, therapeutic and rehabilitative technologies which could become part and parcel of formal health research and programmes<X_> }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (p. 244).}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Most cosmopolitan health workers in Kenya, as elsewhere in 
Africa, argue that indigenous people are not keen about preventive health services. <#/>They point to the poor use of immunization services as proof of their argument. <#/>The examples given show that traditionally African societies had concepts relating 
t
o prevention and took measures to prevent illness. <#/>It is true that some of the concepts were mistaken and many of the preventive measures ineffective. <#/>What is important for this discussion, however, is the fact that the societies were concerned ab
out the prevention of illness. <#/>This concern has been increased with the introduction of cosmopolitan medicine, education and Christianity all of which emphasize preventive health care.
\par <#/>It is true to some extent that African societies are less enthus
iastic about preventive cosmopolitan medical care than about its curative side. <#/>This does not arise merely from the absence of notions of the prevention of illness. <#/>An ethnographic study of this problem by the author indicates that there are sever
al reasons why cosmopolitan preventive health services are less popular than curative services.
\par <#/>The most critical factor accounting for the low popularity of preventive health services provided through official health systems is that their effectiveness
 is not fully demonstrated. <#/>For example, a child who has received all the required vaccinations may still get one of the diseases against which he has been vaccinated. <#/>In many cases health workers do not discuss this possibility with clients. <#/>
I
ndigenous medical systems have explanations for the failure of therapy. <#/>This means that a measure which may have proven ineffective in preventing an illness in a particular case may be taken in future because a specialist or the affected family can ex
p
lain the failure. <#/>The positive effects of preventive biomedical services are not easy to demonstrate, chiefly because the western biomedical concept of prevention differs from indigenous concepts which tend to be comprehensive and usually not so speci
fic. <#/>What cosmopolitan medical workers say about preventive health services is in many cases not clear to the indigenous population.
\par <#/>There are also several socio-economic factors which make it difficult to carry out preventive measures whose efficacy has not been widely demonstrated. <#/>The same problem has occurred with certain types of curative care.
\par }\pard\plain \s89\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {\v <#/>It is important, therefore, that, as more and more preventive health services are planned for indigenous people, attempts are made to integrate t
hese services within indigenous concepts and practices. <#/>To achieve the proper contextualization, it is important for cosmopolitan health care providers to understand what their clients think and do about the prevention of disease. <#/>Quite a number o
f the indigenous concepts of prevention can be used to motivate individuals and communities to participate in modern disease prevention. }{</X>}{\v

\par <#/>The clinical diagnosis of hydatid disease depends on a high index of suspicion. <#/>This is especially important in areas with sporadic cases. <#/>The classical case 
of advanced abdominal hydatid disease usually looks well despite having extreme distension of the abdomen }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Fig. 20)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>However, cysts appearing in rare sites such as in the orbit will often be missed. <#/>In the past enucleation of the eyeball was undert
aken under the mistaken belief that it was due to neoplasm. <#/>Epilepsy may be the initial sign of intracranial hydatid cysts. <#/>A goitre with a cystic feel on palpation may be due to a hydatid cyst of the thyroid gland. <#/>The patient is usually euth
yroid clinically. <#/>The vast majority of hydatid cysts are in the liver (about 70%) followed by the lung (20%). <#/>But Okelo has seen cysts in nearly every organ in the body.

 hepatomegaly is usually present. <#/>Both kidneys may be enlarged and hydronephrosis may occur. <#/>The case shown in Fig. 22 was seen in 1986 and the hydronephrosis resolved following albendazole therapy. <#/>Some of the patients seen were found to have

In early 1986 a young Masai female was admitted with acute abdominal pain. <#/>She had two very large cysts, one of which had ruptured. <#/>This is an unusual case. <#/>Another interesting case was of an adult Turkana female who had obstructive jaundice.

\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 Pulmonary Cysts}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  </h>
\par <#/>These account for about 20% of all our cases. <#/>They are usually asymptomatic, although the authors have seen pulmonary cysts as cough and haemoptysis. <#/>Pulmonary cysts may co-e
xist with pulmonary tuberculosis. <#/>An adult male nurse who had fever, cough, crepitations and the sputum expectorated, showed plenty of protoscoleces. <#/>The classical pulmonary cyst is easy to diagnose radiologically}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  (Fig. 23)}{
\f0\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>An interesting case
 was seen by Okelo in a child who had two large pulmonary cysts, one in each lung, both compressing the heart. <#/>The child preferred to rest in a head down position. <#/>Spontaneous rupture of a cyst during chemotherapy rarely occurs; but broncho-pulmon
ary distula may occur.
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 Bone Cysts}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  </h>
\par <#/>These are rare. <#/>A young female, referred to Okelo, had a spontaneous pathological fracture of the right tibia }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Fig. 24)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>At operation, she was found to have multiple cysts at the fracture site. <#/>
It healed on albendazole therapy. <#/>A young Turkana man was presented to French with a fracture below the left knee following a kick from a donkey. <#/>The fracture failed to unite and the unfortunate man had to have the leg amputated. <#/>This was befo

\par <#/>Diagnosis of most cestode infections involves parasitological examination of biological samples like stool for the presence of the parasite. <#/>Infection of man with hydatidosis represents the larval stage of the worm. <#/>The nature of this inf
ection precludes parasitological diagnosis of the disease. <#/>Thus hydatid disease is diagnosed through procedures which rely on the detection of an immune response directed at the parasite, }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 E. granulosus.}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
\par <#/>Parasite derived components with capacity to 
induce an immune response include the egg (oncosphere), protoscoleces and secretory/ excretory products of the germinal membrane. <#/>Hydatid cyst fluid is enriched with the parasite antigens and is commonly used as the source of hydatid antigen. <#/>A pe
r
son infected with hydatid is sensitized or primed to the antigens which pass through the cyst wall and subsequently enter the blood circulation. <#/>This leads to the induction of anti-echinococcus antibodies and primed T-lymphocytes. <#/>A number of immu
n
ological techniques have been developed based on the detection of hydatid antibodies. <#/>The major specific antibody detected is IgG and IgA while IgM, are present in low rates. <#/>IgE levels are usually raised. <#/>Although testing for antibody has bee
n the practice, major emphasis is now focused on methods designed to detect circulating parasite antigens or parasite specific immune complexes. <#/>This offers better advantages of distinguishing active infection from past experience or recovered cases. 

\par <
#/>In addition, monitoring the antigen is of tremendous value in evaluating a successful surgical operation and the efficacy of antihydatid chemotherapy. <#/>While the determination of T-cell function is an attractive diagnostic procedure, there are at pr
esent no reliable, reproducible or simple and rapid cell-mediated response tests for hydatid disease. <#/>Hence serological methods are the mainstay of hydatidosis diagnosis.
\par <#/>The most widely applied serological tests include:
\par passive haemagglutination (PHA)
\par immunoelectrophoresis, based on arc-5 band (IEP-5)
\par enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
\par radioimmunoassay (RIA)
\par double diffusion (DD)
\par latex agglutination (LA) and
\par complement fixation test (CFT).
\par <#/>Of these, based on the experience of the authors in Turkana District, the choice of method in the Kenyan situation comprises of IEP-5, IHA (PHA) and DD. <#/>With the use of highly purified }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 E. granulosus}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 antigens, ELISA systems should increasingly complement or replace some of these tests particularly in detecting and measuring circulating antigens, non-specific and specific circulating immune complexes.
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 Double Diffusion (DD)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  </h>
\par <#/>This is one of the immunoprecipitation methods. <#/>Soluble antigen and antibody are allowed to combine in a solid
 support. <#/>Both diffuse towards each other and where the two meet, an immune complex is formed and precipitated if the proportions of antigen and antibody are optimal for cross-linking. <#/>The test is performed using purified agar such as Noble agar, 
iron agar and agarose in small petri dishes or on glass slides. <#/>Two wells are punched in the agar using DD template.
\par <#/>Hydatid cyst fluid antigen (HCF/Ag) is placed in one of the wells, while serum from a suspected }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 E. granulosus}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  infected patient is pu
t in the other. <#/>Diffusion is allowed to occur in a moist chamber at room temperature. <#/>Between 24-48 hours later, precipitin arcs are formed if the serum contains anti-echinococcus antibodies.
\par <#/>The test is very simple to set up and reasonably cheap. <#/>Specificity to }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 E. granulosus}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  is enhanced by purification of hydatid antigens and both "arc-5" and "arc-4" precipitin bands can be demonstrated.

\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 Immunoelectrophoresis (IEP-5)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  </h>
\par <#/>Immunoelectrophoresis based on "arc-5" precipitin band is
 a modification of the conventional electrophoresis and immunodiffusion test. <#/>The test is performed with agarose on glass slides. <#/>Complex hydatid antigens are placed in wells made with the aid of IEP template and separated according to their overa
l
l surface charge, and molecular sized by applying a <-/pontential> voltage difference across the slide. <#/>Antigenic components thus migrate depending on their physical and chemical properties. <#/>After separation of the hydatid antigens, serum containi
n
g suspected anti-echinococcus antibodies is introduced into the trough made in the agarose. <#/>Immuno-diffusion is allowed to proceed in a moist chamber for 24-48 hours or more. <#/>Reactivity against the hydatid antigens is demonstrated by the formation
 of a characteristic precipitation band designated "arc-5"}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  (Fig. 26)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>This is due to reaction between antigen 5 (one of the key diagnostic hydatid antigens) and specific }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Echinococcus}{
\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 antibodies. <#/>The precipitin band has a well defined morphology that is associated with hydatid infections and to a less extent crossreactivity with cysticercosis and certain myeloma conditions. <#/>However, IEP-5 is considered the only reliable techni
que and provides a confirmatory test for }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 E. granulosus}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  infections.
\par <#/>A major drawback of the technique is a relatively high incidence of false negative reactivity. <#/>Work carried out by Chemtai and Okelo in Turkana District showed that IEP-5 test can on
ly detect <-/upto> 60% of surgically confirmed hydatid patients. <#/>Several explanations have been given by the authors for this anomalous sensitivity reaction. <#/>As hydatid cysts among Turkana patients are enormous, it is conceivable that there is a c
o
ntinuous release of excess antigen into blood circulation. <#/>This leads to the formation of immune complexes and mopping up of anti-echinococcus antibodies leaving very low free antibodies in circulation. <#/>Alternatively, it is thought that infection 
with E. }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 granulosus }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
leads to profound specific and generalized immunosuppression. <#/>This parasite-induced immunodepression could lead to diminished antibody production due to perturbation in the immune-regulatory mechanisms. <#/>While it was not well demon
strated in the studies conducted in Turkana, false-negative results may also be associated with the site and viability of the cyst. <#/>Pulmonary cysts have been reported to show low immunoreactivity.
\par <#/>Finally, a general appraisal of serological tests r
eveals that conventional IEP has an inherent sensitivity of 5-10mg/dl which could also contribute to the poor performance of the test. <#/>Together, these factors account for the discrepancy of high incidence of sero-negative reactive hydatid patients det
ected using IEP-5 test.

\par ii) physical
\par iii) both psychological and physical.
\par <#/>When dependence on a drug occurs it is characterised by: 
\par <#/>a. craving (obsessive - compulsive) for the drug, no matter which means is used to get it.
\par <#/>b. drug tolerance - that is need to increase the dose steadily to reach the desired effects.
\par <#/>c. withdrawal symptoms in case of abstinence (withdrawal syndrome or abstinence syndrome).
\par <#/>d. suffering ultimately caused to the drug addict or abuser and to the society as a whole.
\par <h> <#/>SOURCES OF DRUGS </h>
\par <#/>Drugs are either obtained naturally or synthetic (man made).
\par <h> <#/>Natural sources </h>
\par - animals 
\par - moulds and fungi 
\par - microbes.
\par <h> <#/>Preparation </h<
\par <#/>Drugs are prepared and packed in several forms:
\par - powders
\par - tablets and capsules, lozenges (pills) 
\par - creams and lotions, ointments 
\par - liquids and solutions 
\par - pessaries and suppositories.
\par <h> <#/>WAYS OF ADMINISTRATION </h>
\par <#/>Drugs enter the blood stream through several routes. <#/>The following are the major ones:
\par <#/>1. Oral or through the mouth: These drugs are ingested and take some time to act.
\par <#/>2. Injections through muscles or straight to the veins: The effect is felt in seconds or minutes after administration.
\par <#/>3. Topical: This route is simplest and safest. <#/>It is just applied on the skin or part of the skin needing treatment. <#/>They take longer to act (days or weeks).
\par <#/>4. Inhalation: Some drugs are inhaled through the respiratory tract and the effect is as sudden as that one of injecting through the vein. <#/>Such drugs are like volatile gases, cigarette smoke, chemicals, for example petrol and glue.
\par <#/>5. Rectally or vaginally: Suppositories are inserted rectally while pessaries are inserted through the vagina but these are rare cases.
\par <h> <#/>EFFECTS OF DRUGS IN OUR BODIES </h>
\par <#/>When we take drugs, some physiological or pharmacological effects occur (immediate or acute effects). <#/>When a drug enters the blood stream, it reacts with our body cells. <#/>Either the cells are stimulated to act or they are blocked from acting. <
#/>Their function is changed and this influences our feelings, emotions and behaviour.
\par <h> <#/>USE OF DRUGS </h>
\par <#/>Drugs are important in our day to day life. <#/>They are either used as:
\par <#/>1. Stimulants or blockers for example when there is hyposecretion or underfunction
\par <#/>2. Antagonists or blockers for example pain killers
\par <#/>3. Replacement therapy for example iron, vitamins.
\par <#/>When drugs are used as medication the process is known as therapeutic. <#/>But when an individual uses a prescribed drug 
for purposes other than the one intended, it is known as drug misuse, for example using piriton tablets in higher dosage to induce sleep. <#/>When one uses drugs for non medical purposes persistently and for his own intended reasons, it is known as drug a
buse. <#/>When this occurs beyond the will and control of the individual and is used persistently and excessively for non-medial purposes, then this condition is known as drug addiction or drug dependence.}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <h> <#/>DRUGS COMMONLY ABUSED </h>
\par <#/>Drugs which are commonly abused by people are drugs of addiction. <#/>These are drugs which are habitually taken by individuals for non-medical purposes and with imminent craving. <#/>They are basically classified into five categories:
\par <h> <#/>a. Sedatives </h>
\par <#/>These are drugs which reduce excitement or functional activities. <#/>They make one drowsy without actually inducing sleep. <#/>Examples are alcohol, barbiturates and peps.
\par <h> <#/>Psychotropic Drugs </h>
\par <#/>The psychotropic drugs are generally defined to i
nclude the antipsychotics (major tranquillisers, neuroleptics), antidepressants, anxiolytics (minor tranquillisers) barbiturates and non-barbiturate hypnosedatives. <#/>It has now been widely recognised that the introduction of these drugs in clinical pra
c
tice has played a major role in the positive revolution which has taken place all over the world in the last forty years in the care of the mentally ill. <#/>This revolution has been of enormous benefit to all mankind. <#/>Unfortunately the easy availabil
i
ty of these drugs has also led to widespread use, misuse and abuse, not only as a result of illicit use, but also as a result of legitimate medical use. <#/>It was in fact the recognition of these dangers which led to the drafting of the United Nations Co
nvention on the psychotropics in 1971.
\par <#/>Of the psychotropic drugs, the antipsychotics, though widely used and frequently prescribed for a long period when used in treatment of schizophrenia, have little or no tendency to produce dependence and tolerance.
 <#/>Moreover, many of them do produce some nasty side effects even in small doses. <#/>For these reasons, the neuroleptics are currently not presenting significant problems of addiction. <#/>However, the minor tranquillisers and the barbiturate sedatives
 
which have been used in the past or are currently widely used legitimately and illicitly have been shown to produce severe dependence, tolerance and serious withdrawal reactions. <#/>In small doses, both barbiturates and benzodiazepines relieve anxiety an
d
 tension resulting in calmness (tranquillity) and sleep. <#/>But in higher doses, barbiturates produce a state of drunkenness and a high feeling similar to the effects of alcohol. <#/>At these doses, toxicity occurs and this is characterised by slurring o
f
 the speech, staggering gait, sluggishness and impairment of memory. <#/>With prolonged use of high doses, barbiturates produce severe dependence, tolerance and cross tolerance with other cerebral depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines). <#/>Unlike alcohol
,
 the lethal dose of barbiturates does not increase as tolerance develops. <#/>The barbiturates addicts are therefore at great risk of sudden possible inadvertent overdose which may result in death. <#/>Barbiturates withdrawal syndromes which are initially
 characterised by anxiety, depression, insomnia, weakness and irritability may progress to confusion, delirium and convulsions. 
\par <#/>The benzodiazepines produce similar complications during dependence though slowly and less dangerously. <#/>But even at ther
apeutic doses, they may cause agitation and release of aggressive tendencies instead of tranquillity. <#/>Withdrawal symptoms are very similar to those of the barbiturates. <#/>Furthermore, because of the widespread use and easy availability of these drug
s, they are frequently used in suicide attempts.
\par <#/>Certain related compounds such as glutethimide (Doriden) and Metha-qualone produce dependence syndromes and withdrawal reactions half way between barbiturates and benzodiazepines in terms of severity.
\par <h> <#/>b. Stimulants </h>
\par <#/>These are the drugs which stimulate the C.N.S., altering many brain functions, for example, perception, reasoning and judgement, emotions and feelings, intelligence. <#/>Examples of these are amphetamines, cocaine and <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 miraa}

 include tooth decay, gastritis, constipation and in men spermatorrhoea and impotence.

 use is associated with significant health and social-economic problems i
s no longer in dispute especially among health personnel. <#/>What remains unclear is the amount that constitutes abuse and which leads to harm. <#/>In economic terms, the cultivation of <afr/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 khat}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 as a crop is without doubt a profitable business that has surpassed other cash crops such as coffee in some countries. <#/>In Kenya for instance, the export of <afr/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 khat}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 brings into the country the much needed foreign exchange earnings! In any case there has not been any major local study to date which has conclusively established the association of <afr/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 khat}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 use with health and socio-economic problems serious enough to warrant prohibition. <#/>There is an urgent need for such a study which may assist the governments to define the position of <afr/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 khat}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  cultivat
ion and trade.
\par <h> <#/>(ii) Psychostimulant Drugs (Cocaine and Amphetamines) </h>
\par <#/>The health consequences of the use and abuse of these drugs are similar. <#/>Taken in small doses they produce a sense of exhilaration (euphoria), increased alertness and
 reduction of fatigue and hunger. <#/>Larger doses intensify these feelings and may lead to bizarre, erratic behaviour, hostility and violence. <#/>These behavioural disturbances are accompanied by physical symptoms of over-stimulation of the sympathetic 
n
ervous system, such as accelerated heartbeat, raised blood pressure and temperature and fast breathing. <#/>Taken in even higher doses, as may occur in an overdose, acute toxic reactions will occur. <#/>These consist of <-_agitations><+_agitation>, restle
ssness, delirium, hallucinations and even delusions and in serious cases tremors, lack of muscle coordination, spasms and convulsions. <#/>Death may even result from respiratory arrest, cerebral haemorrhage and <-/hyperthermia>.
\par <#/>When used repeatedly ove
r long periods, dependence (physical and psychological), tolerance and withdrawal symptoms will occur. <#/>Chronic use may also produce typical hallucinations, <-/formication> or cocaine bug (a sensation as of ants crawling over the body) and delusions of
 
persecution. <#/>States of fluctuation between periods of induced elation and drug free periods of depression and apathy with suicidal ideas and behaviour are also common. <#/>Chronic amphetamine dependence is very frequently associated with weight loss, 
m
alnutrition, vitamin deficiencies and increased susceptibility to infections. <#/>Chronic cocaine snorting is associated with stuffiness and running nose and perforation of the nasal septum. <#/>Severe psychotic illness indistinguishable from paranoid sch
i
zophrenia occurs with heavy use of both drugs. <#/>Withdrawal symptoms, which are more severe in amphetamine than in cocaine dependence, initially consist of craving, fatigue, prolonged disturbed sleep, hunger followed by irritability, depression and suic
idal behaviour. <#/>Intravenous cocaine use is further associated with increased risk of abscesses, hepatitis, septicaemia, AIDS and tetanus.
\par <h> <#/>(iii) Cannabis (<afr/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 bhang}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 ) </h>
\par <#/>Harmful consequences of cannabis use may result from the dependence syndrome, tolerance, withdrawal phenomena and possibly direct toxic effect. <#/>However the nature, frequency and severity of its harmful effects have been demonstrated mainly in anim
a
ls. <#/>Evidence of serious damage caused to human health is also accumulating. <#/>Immediate consequences of cannabis use (observed within a few minutes after taking the drug) are feelings of being 'high', that is, mild to moderate euphoria, and some rel
a
xation. <#/>At a higher dose, cannabis may cause distortion of time and other perceptions. <#/>Thus a time interval may appear prolonged, sound and colour perceptions may also be sharpened or distorted. <#/>At a still higher dose, cannabis may interfere w
i
th attention, concentration, memory and logical thinking, so that an individual's ability to perform complex actions or to make sound judgements becomes impaired. <#/>Such a person can therefore become violent and run into serious problems such as acciden
t
s if driving or operating a machine. <#/>At an even higher dose, a cannabis user may develop a psychosis characterised by restlessness, confusion, excitement, panic, paranoia and hallucinations. <#/>At the time of writing it is not known whether such psyc
h
osis is due directly to the toxic effect of the drug or to the unmasking of psychosis in a predisposed individual. <#/>Cannabis psychosis is a short-lived illness in the majority of people, but it constitutes between five and ten percent of acute cases ad
m
itted into mental hospitals in Africa. <#/>A small proportion of chronic heavy users of cannabis may develop the 'amotivational syndrome' which is characterised by slow, progressive loss of energy and drive, apathy, memory impairment, poverty of ideas and
 
deterioration in personal hygiene. <#/>These complications can disappear after several months if drug use is discontinued. <#/>Other reported health consequences among heavy cannabis users are lung diseases, chromosome abnormality, carcinogenic effects, s
u
ppression of the immune system and interference with male reproductive functions. <#/>Recently clear evidence has linked heavy and chronic cannabis use with damage to the respiratory system, especially in the occurrence of bronchitis, inflammatory change,
 reduction in gas diffusion and lung cancer.
\par <#/>c. Hard drugs or narcotics 
\par <#/>These are very strong pain-killers and sleep-inducing drugs, for example heroin, opium, morphine, pethidine, which produce physical and psychological dependence. <#/>They are m
ostly injectables and are very dangerous. <#/>The sleep induced is unnatural.
\par <#/>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Opiates (Heroin, opium, morphine, pethidine etc) 
\par <#/>Among these drugs, the one which is currently causing a lot of concern in
 Africa is heroin. <#/>Available information indicates that the use and abuse of heroin, which until recently was confined to only one or two African countries, seems to be spreading very fast. <#/>Newspaper reports of seizures of heroin in transit as wel
l
 as arrests for possession have become frequent. <#/>The use and abuse of opiates is associated with some of the most serious health hazards. <#/>The immediate effect of these drugs is pain relief and induction of a pleasant, dreamy, detached euphoria. <#
/
>But restlessness, nausea and vomiting may also occur. <#/>With moderate and high doses the body feels warm and extremely heavy, with dry mouth, and the user may go into 'nod' - an alternating wakeful and drowsy state during which the world is forgotten. 
<
#/>At a still higher dose, breathing becomes progressively shallower as the respiratory centres get depressed and drowsy. <#/>On physical examination at this stage there is contraction of the pupils (miosis), cold moist skin, intense constipation, and dea
th may occur as a result of respiratory failure.
\par <#/>Other dangers of short term use of heroin in particular result from the mode of administration, which is mostly done illegally, and the composition of the dose is not well known, as the dealers tend to di
lute it with other substances. <#/>Thus a fatal overdose or severe abstinence syndrome can occur. <#/>Furthermore the material used for 'cutting' may be active drugs such as strychnine, barbiturates, amphetamines or inactive substances such as talcum powd
er, or even household cleaners. <#/>The presence of large insoluble particles constitutes an additional danger if injected intravenously, by obstructing the small vessels in the eyes or brain. <X_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
<#/>The intravenous use of unsterilised or shared needles also c
arries the danger of infection. <#/>Thus a heroin addict using intravenous injection may develop abscesses, cellulitis, endocarditis, serum hepatitis, tetanus, brain abscesses, pneumonia and AIDS.
\par <h> <#/>Prolonged Use </h>
\par <#/>Repeated use of opiates over
 a period of time easily leads to dependence (physical and psychological), tolerance and withdrawal symptoms which can be very serious and life threatening. <#/>When these drugs (pethidine and morphine) are used in hospital situations, the risks are minim
ised by carefully regulating the interval between the doses as well as limiting the number of doses given.
\par <#/>Withdrawal syndromes from opiates which occur within a few hours of the last dose are characterised in the early stages by restlessness, piloerect
ion (goose flesh skin), tremors, loss of appetite and irritability. <#/>The later or peak stages are characterised by yawning, sneezing, running nose, lacrimation, nausea, abdominal cramps, vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, chills, sweating, hypertension, tachy
c
ardia and severe craving for the drug. <#/>These peak periods occur between 48 and 72 hours after the last dose and gradually subside in a week, though some bodily functions may take up to six months to revert to normal. <#/>If the person was in poor heal
th, the withdrawal phenomena may be fatal.
\par <#/>In some cases, the withdrawal stages can be protracted with the patient staying irritable, unable to tolerate pain and with a poor self image.
\par <#/>Other health consequences of heavy chronic opiate abuse occur a
mong pregnant women and include serious physical illness such as anaemia, heart diseases, diabetes, pneumonia, as well as increased risk of spontaneous abortions, breech delivery, premature births, and still births. <#/>Children of opiate dependent women 
are also generally smaller than average and are prone to infantile infections. <#/>Mortality among these children is high.

\par <#/>Most diets in developing countries are deficient in protein. <#/>The total protein consum
ed in developing countries per person is 56 grams compared to 90 grams in economically developed countries. <#/>It has been recommended that for good health each person needs at least 70 grams of protein per day }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Lowry, 1976)}{
\f0\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>Some of the relatively cheap food crops that can help alleviate this protein crisis are the grain legumes of which the common bean }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Phaseolus vulgaris}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 L}{
\f0\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>has been reported to play a vital role in most developing countries }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Borlang, 1972; Kaiser, 1976)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>The common bean is on
e of the main grain legumes grown in the tropics and is grown extensively in East Africa and Asia. <#/>Singh and Van Emeden (1979) estimated the world hectarage under beans as 2.4 million. <#/>As was noted above, beans as a source of protein can play an i
m
portant role in the predominantly cereal diets in tropical countries such as Kenya because of their high food value (table 1). <#/>The protein content of beans has been reported to be in the range of 16 - 33 % depending on bean variety and environmental c
onditions under which they are grown }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Bressani, 1972)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>Nutritionally beans are 2 - 3 times richer in protein content than cereal grains }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Parkins and Bills, 1955)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 , and are therefore often incorporated into livestock feed; and this has improved livestock 
production and inland fish production }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (F.A.O. Report, 1977)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>Furthermore, beans require little additional nitrogenous fertilizers for average growth because they have the capacity to provide their own nitrogenous compounds through bacterial nitrogen fi
xation in their root nodules. <#/>The bacteria convert nitrogen gas from the air into nitrogenous compounds which are utilized by beans for growth and development. <#/>In Kenya, the common bean is the major grain legume in terms of production and consumpt
ion }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Khamala, 1978)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>It provides the cheapest source of protein, being about four times cheaper than animal protein. <#/>It is cultivated in various parts of the country along with other crops (Table 2). <#/>Mostly it is intercropped with other crops especially maize.

\par <#/>However, there are a number of factors that limit production of beans which include plant diseases, unreliable rainfall, high temperatures, inadequate plant nutrients in the soil and above all, pests. <#/>Pests cause damage to the beans
 in the field as well as in the store. <#/>In the store, damage is caused by bruchids, of which the common bean bruchid }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Acanthoscelides obtectus}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 Say causes considerable damage due to the feeding behaviour of their larvae. <#/>Once attacked by the bruchids the quantity and quality of the stored bean seeds are greatly reduced.
\par <#/>The extent of economic losses due to insect attacks on stored beans are known to be substantial in various countries. <#/>Thus, in Mexico and other Central American countries econom
ic losses have been estimated as 35 per cent and in Brazil as 13 per cent }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical, 1986)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>In Kenya, it has been reported that 50 - 75 per cent of bean farmers experience crop loss to insects despite using various insect control methods }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Schonherr }{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 et al.}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 , 1976)}{
\f0\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 A. obtectus}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  has been controlled using insecticides such as lindane, gamma B.H.C. and malathion. <#/>However, the control of stored product insects using malathion and lindane has been reported to have fai
led in several countries due to emergence of resistant strains }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Champ and Dyte, 1977)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>Insect pests resistant to common insecticides are rapidly increasing }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057

. <#/>Moreover, insecticide residues in stored products could be more hazardous than in field crops. <#/>This is because in the store, insecticides are not exposed to weathering processes which reduce the hazardous effects of insecticides in field crops.

\par <#/>Therefore, there is need to develop more effective and safe control measures for }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 A. obtectus}{\f0\fs24\lang2057

. <#/>However, little has been done about it. <#/>Plant resistance as a method for insect pest control offers many advantages. <#/>In some cases it is even the only method that is effective and practical }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Horber, 1972)}{
\f0\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>For crops grown in developing countries, perhaps the most attractive feature of using pest resistant varieties of crops including beans is that virtually no skill in pest control or cash investment is required at the grower level }
{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Maxwell and Jennings, 1980)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>Furthermore, a major advantage of using resistant varieties is the induction of a constant level of suppression on pest population growth. <#/>The number of pests which attack resistant varieties usually de
cline over time making control with insecticides easier. <#/>Resistant varieties are also highly compatible with biological control since both methods usually do not greatly affect natural enemies of the pest species }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
(Akisson and Dyck, 1980)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>Breeding 
and selection of plant varieties resistant or less susceptible to insect attack is based on insect-host plant relationships. <#/>Therefore before embarking on the breeding and selection programmes, it is of vital importance to know the characteristics of 
the plant and more so the behavioural and physiological characteristics of the pest.
\par <#/>Many varieties of beans are cultivated in Kenya and in fact some are grown in localized areas. <#/>Moreover, some of the varieties were recently bred and selected by
 researchers to suit various growing zones of the country. <#/>Furthermore, some selected varieties have been bred for their high yield and short growing season. <#/>However, although various control methods have been used to control }{
\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 A. obtectus}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  in Kenya, it is still a major pest of stored beans. <#/>In this study, it was considered important to study the behavioural relationship between }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 A. obtectus}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 and bean varieties under cultivation in Kenya. <#/>In particular, it was considered of scientific interest to

e 10). <#/>These were obtained from the local market. <#/>The varieties were identified with the help of the Horticultural Research Centre, Kenya.
\par <#/>Since bean varieties are known by many names depending on the locality in which they are grown, the varieties used in this study were given code names commonly used by plant breeders in Kenya and their physical appearances described (Table 3).

\par <#/>Determinati
on of the moisture content of the bean seeds was considered important because moisture content affects growth and development of bruchids that feed on stored seeds. <#/>For average growth and development, most of them prefer seeds with about 7 -12 % moist
ure content }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Munro, 1966)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>Moisture contents of the seeds were determined using the oven method }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Hall, 1970)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057

\par <#/>Having <-/succeded> in demonstrating the location and structure of the baroreceptor structure in the giraffe, we then turned our attention to the first of the three questions raised above
 namely, how does the giraffe sustain an adequate blood flow to the brain despite its long neck. <#/>It may be recalled that other workers had already demonstrated that the animal has a relatively high central arterial pressure in the range of 350/250 mm 
Hg}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  (Goetz and Keen, 1957; Goetz et al., 1960; Goetz, 1962; Van Citter et al., 1966; 1968; 1969)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>The blood pressure profiles noted when the tip of the catheter is progressively <-/withrawn> from the heart cephalad, shows a gradual drop so that at the le
vel of the brain the pressure is about 12O/9OmmHg. <#/>Apparently this is fairly close to the brain perfusion pressure in man. <#/>For this reason, the type of high pressure in this animal, has been referred to as adaptive or gravitational hypertension.

\par <#
/>These earlier studies led to the conclusion that the pressure generated by the giraffe heart is adequate to maintain blood supply to the brain without recourse to any <-/auxillary> mechanisms, such as a siphon effect or a peristaltic wave along the arte
r
ies of the neck. <#/>In the course of our studies we came across some evidence, though subtle, suggesting that a rise in pressure of only 50 mm Hg when the head of a recumbent anaesthetised giraffe was raised for a vertical distance of 150 cm above the he
art level, could not suffice to maintain blood pressure at the brain level within limits against a calculated hydrostatic pressure of 110 mm Hg }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Goetz et al., 1960)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>This indicated to us that some other mechanisms yet to be fully elucidated may come into play.
\par <#/>Faced with this dilemma, we were led to believe that some of the mechanisms by which the giraffe ensures an adequate cerebral perfusion pressure, and protection of the brain when it lowers its head to drink, may be a function of the hypertrophi
ed wall of the left ventricle, the morphology of the blood vessels and appropriate barostatic reflexes. <#/>Our studies revealed that the carotid arterial system of the giraffe has a unique structure which other workers had failed to appreciate in explain
ing the adaptive mechanisms to gravitational stresses in the giraffe }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Kimani, 1979; 1983a)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>For example, near the root 
of the neck, the carotid arteries have the structure of an elastic artery in the luminal third and a prominent muscular structure in the outer <-/twothirds>. <#/>Towards the head, the luminal elastic zone diminishes and is replaced by smooth muscle. <#/>F
u
rthermore, the smooth muscle in the outer part of the tunica media is organized in form of conspicuous bundles, separated by septa of fibrous tissue. <#/>These septa continue into the tunica adventitia and bring small vessels with them that nourish the mu
s
cular tissue in the tunica media. <#/>This mode of transition of the vessel wall from an elastic artery to a muscular artery is at variance with the classical textbook accounts, in which it is stated that elastic tissue persists on the outer side and smoo
th muscle appears on the luminal side.
\par <#/>Electron microscopy revealed a close apposition of the smooth muscle cells in the outer layer of the vessel wall and sometimes formation of nexuses }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Kimani, 1979; Kimani, 1981a) }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>The latter are areas of electr
otonic coupling between adjacent cells, so that membrane depolarisation can pass from one cell to another. <#/>The individual cells showed a large content of myofilaments and paucity of synthetic organelles. <#/>This suggested to us that these cells have 
a
 preponderantly contractile function and diminished fibrosynthetic function. <#/>It is generally believed, that the smooth muscle cell is the only type of cell found in the tunica media of arteries. <#/>As such, it must be the cell responsible for the pro
duction of the extracellular components, such as collagen and elastic fibres in addition to its contractile function }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Glagov, 1972)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>In support of this dual function of the vascular smooth muscle, is the demonstration in numerous studies that vascular s
mooth muscle cells in elastic arteries contain both myofilaments and synthetic organelles. <#/>Consequently, these cells have been referred to as myofibroblasts. <#/>In the giraffe carotid arterial system, myofibrofiblast-like cells are found only in the 
luminal elastic zone, where they occur between the elastic lamellae, while typical smooth muscle cells occupy the outer layers of the tunica media }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Kimani, 1979)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>Another cell with fibroblastic characteristics occurs in the outer two-third of the tunica media, particularly within the connective tissue septa between the bundles of smooth muscle }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Kimani, 1979)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>Our findings on the giraffe made two important contributions to knowledge: first, that the statement that the smooth muscle cell is the only ce
ll type in the tunica media of blood vessels is no longer tenable; and second, that in the giraffe carotid artery, the mode of arterial transition from elastic to muscular arteries differs from that described in many classical textbooks of histology. <#/>
Our study revealed also another notable feature of the giraffe arteries; i.e., the endothelium is anchored to the underlying tissues through a multilaminated basement membrane which we thought, is an adaptation to elevated luminal shearing }{
\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Kimani, 1981b; Kimani, 1983b)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>Related to this is the fact that a similar, but poorly organized fibrillar material forms the earliest noticeable structural component in the subendothelial zone of the vessels of spontaneously hypertensive rats }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
(Limas et al., 1980)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 . <#/
>Though this material had been regarded as a pathological change, its natural appearance in the giraffe may indicate otherwise- it forms part of the functional adaptation of the arterial wall to elevated luminal shearing in conditions of raised blood pres
sure.
\par <#/>We kept on wondering whether there are any structural differences between the adult and fetal giraffe carotid arteries and other vessels. <#/>This is because whereas fetal giraffes develop in a quasi-weightless <-/mileu>, postpartum giraffes must 
contend with increasing load bearing in their dependent tissues as they grow to heights over 5 metres and to weights over 1000 kilograms. <#/>We were not allowed to kill pregnant mothers during our numerous culling expeditions. <#/>Our anxiety was, howeve
r
, rewarded one day when someone from the Nairobi National Park turned up in the department with the magical specimen- a full term fetal giraffe whose mother had died in "labour" at the Zoo. <#/>A detailed histological analysis of material obtained from th
e common carotid arterial system revealed that the proximal part of the common carotid artery has the features of a typical elastic artery }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Kimani, 1979; 1983a)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>The tunica media consists of uniformly arranged and alternating elastic lamellae in its ent
ire thickness. <#/>This is in sharp contrast to the transmural zonation observed in the adult vessels, in which elastic lamellae are only confined to the luminal <-/onethird>, while the outer two-thirds contain a large amount of smooth muscle. <#/>This su
ggests that the smooth muscle in the outer <-/twothirds> of the tunica media appears postnatally.
\par <#/>The question remained, however, whether the large content of smooth muscle noted in the giraffe carotid arteries is a unique adaptation to the attendant ha
emodynamic stresses. <#/>To answer this question we decided to study the vertebral artery, which is another artery found in the neck. <#/>In humans, this vessel is one of the two main sources of blood supply to the brain. <#/>Gross anatomical studies in t
he giraffe and other members of the Artiodactyla group had shown that this artery does not supply the brain }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
(Lawrence and Rewell, 1948; Appleton, and Waites, l957; Goetz and Keen; 1957; Waites, 1960; Baldwin and Bell, 1963a, 1963b, 1963c; Kimani, 1979)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 . <#/
>It had also been noted that the first branch of the common carotid artery at the base of the head sends a branch which establishes a direct anastomosis with the vertebral artery }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Lawrence and Rewell, 1948; Goetz and Keen, 1957)}{
\f0\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>Lawrence and Rewell (1
957) were the first to describe this artery in the giraffe and <-/contrigued> that it constituted the major difference between the giraffe and other Artiodactyls. <#/>The question has been raised in our studies whether the function of this artery is to es
t
ablish a direct anastomosis, and therefore a collateral circulation between the carotid and vertebral arteries. <#/>It seems to us that under normal circumstances, this artery is responsible for the vascular supply of the upper one third of the neck. <#/>
T
he evidence pertinent to this conclusion stems from three important findings: first, this artery gives off a prominent muscular branch before entering through the alar foramen of the atlas; second, the internal vertebral branch after passing through the a
l
ar foramen makes a sharp turn and descends caudally within the vertebral canal to anastomose with the internal branch of the vertebral artery; and third, the vertebral artery terminates at the junction between the second and third cervical vertebrae by di
v
iding into an internal and an external branch. <#/>The internal branch enters through the intervertebral foramen and runs horizontally within the vertebral canal before giving off an ascending branch that anastomoses with the internal vertebral branch of 
t
he first dorsal branch of the carotid artery. <#/>For this reason, this branch of the carotid artery may be more appropriately named "accessory vertebral artery." Thus, in the giraffe, as in most other Artiodactyls, the vertebral blood does not participat
e in the supply of cephalic structures because it is confined to the neck-region by the pressure barrier in the carotid-vertebral anastomosis. 
\par <#/>Histological studies revealed that the proximal part of the vertebral artery has the features of an elastic artery, while its cranial segment has the features of a typical muscular artery }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Kimani, 1987b)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>Compared with the carotid artery, the vertebral artery has a thinner wall conceivably on account of its smaller calibre. <#/>The transition zone from elasti
c to the muscular parts lies at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra. <#/>Here the tunica media shows a transmural differentiation into a luminal muscular zone and an outer elastic zone. <#/>This is in contrast to the pattern observed in the common ca
r
otid artery in which the muscular tissue occupies the outer portion of the tunica media and elastic tissue the luminal portion. <#/>It resembles, however, the mode of arterial transition from elastic to muscular arteries described in many classical textbo
oks of histology }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Bloom and Fawcett, 1968)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>These findings led us to conclude that vertebral and carotid arteries in the giraffe may be subjected to different haemodynamic demands. <#/>It is conceivable that whereas the pressure developed by the heart i
s adequate for perfusion of the areas supplied by the vertebral arteries, a peripheral <-/auxillary> mechanism may be necessary in the case of the carotid arterial system; and this may be reflected in its mural remodelling process during the postnatal gro
wth and development which is characterized by appearance of smooth muscle on the outer part of the vessel wall.
\par <#/>The camel is another animal with a long neck just like the giraffe. <#/>In fact the generic name of the giraffe - }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 camelopardalis }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 means the ca
melleopard. <#/>This is in reference to its long camellike neck, and reticulated leopard-like skin. <#/>However, whereas the giraffe's neck is held vertically as it browses on trees, that of the camel undulates horizontally. <#/>Hence, under normal circum
s
tances, the camel's brain is more or less at the same height as the trunk and hence the heart. <#/>We wondered whether there are any structural differences between the common carotid arteries of the giraffe and camel in view of these postural differences 
o
f their necks. <#/>In particular we wanted to know how the structure of the blood vessels in the neck of the camel change from the heart peripherally. <#/>To our delight, we noted that in the camel, the change from elastic to muscular parts of the carotid
 artenes is quite the opposite of the pattern observed in the giraffe, but resembles the latter's vertebral artery. <#/>Therefore, the area of transition shows a transmural zonation into a luminal muscular segment and outer elastic segment.
\par <#/>The above ob
servations made in the camel brought us fairly close to what we thought was a unique and significant finding in the giraffe: that the large content of smooth muscle noted within the carotid arteries could, in deed, be a special adaptation to gravitational
 
stresses. <#/>However, there was one missing piece of evidence in this puzzle, i.e., does this smooth muscle have an autonomic or motor nerve supply to trigger its contraction? <#/>Other studies based on the small laboratory animals had confirmed that aut
onomic nerves on blood vessels maintain a basal tonic state so that when an innervated vessel is subjected to sudden stretch, it responds in a more myogenic fashion unlike a <-/dennervated> vessel which acts more like a flaccid tube. <X_>}{
\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Myogenic response i
s a contraction which is generated by intraluminal distension of the artery. <#/>Furthermore, experimental data has demonstrated that the higher the tonic state of the arterial preparation the greater is the force of its myogenic response. <#/>We decided,
 therefore, to develop simple techniques for <-/demostrating> autonomic nerves in our study.
\par <#/>A review of the existing literature showed that following the discovery of a technique for transforming intracellular catecholamines into fluorescent products i

. <#/>The factors responsible for low food productivity in Africa are numerous. <#/>They include drought, low fertility soils and agricultural pests, as well as vectors of diseases, such as tsetse and ticks, which spread devastating diseases to livest
ock. <#/>Only 3-6% of the landmass in eastern and central Africa receives more than 1250 mm of rainfall per year. <#/>However, this rainfall is highly variable both in timing and duration }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Odhiambo, 1984)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057

. <#/>Another serious problem restricting food productivity is insect pests; this paper focuses primarily on this problem and its solutions. <#/>It is estimated that although 80% of all animals are insects, less than l % of insects are pests }{
\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Smith and Pimentel, 1978)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>Insect pests attack agricultural crops, in the field and in storage, causing consider
able losses of agricultural produce. <#/>Ever since the dawn of cropbased agriculture, control of pests, diseases and weeds has been a central objective of crop production practices. <#/>Thus, pest management is an ancient problem. <#/>For instance, over 
2
500 years BC, the Sumarians used sulphur compounds to control insects and mites; crude wooden implements, including hoes, were used to control weeds. <#/>The Chinese controlled insect pests by adjusting crop planting times, and by exploiting natural enemi

. <#/>On worldwide basis, crop losses to all pests (insects, diseases and weeds) are estimated to be nearly 48%; this includes 35 % preharvest and 20% postharvest losses, whereas in USA alone pre
harvest and postharvest losses are estimated to be 33% and 9%, respectively}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  (Smith and Pimentel, 1978)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>The losses of major agricultural crops caused by field pests are estimated to average 42% in Africa and 43% in Asia; these are conservative overall 
estimates, because in some tropical developing countries, losses of 94-97% have been reported. <#/>Cowpea yield losses at Samaru in Northern Nigeria for instance, were estimated at 92%, 94% and 97% in 1971, 1972 and 1973, respectively }{

\par <#/>Vectors of livestock diseases such as tsetse also limit food pr

\f0\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>Now is therefore the r

to sustainable agricultural production. <#/>This paper deals with the problems associated with heavy use of chemical pesticides, and how they can be avoided through adoption of IPM.

. <#/>Estimates from 38 developing countries show that of all pesticides, insecticides are the most used. <#/>The proportions of pesticides used in 1973 were 12.2% insecticides, 30.4% fungicides and 3.4% herbicides }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057

only about one fifth of this amount is used for every person in third world countries }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Bull, 1982) }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>In USA, about 1 billion pounds of pesticides are used each year}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057

brought about the promise of an effective weapon against pests that devastate crops and insects that spread diseases. <#/>In Britain, for instance, where food production relies heavily on pesticides, these chemicals have helped to increase production by m

the third world, chemical pesticides have also improved crop production significantly. <#/>For instance, chemical weeding of groundnuts, 2 and 4 weeks after sowing has been reported to increase yields by as much as 179%. <#/>Similarly, experiments at IRRI
,
 Philippines, showed that rice plots protected by insecticides yielded an average of 2.7 tons/ha. more than unprotected plots, almost doubling the yield. <#/>In Ghana, the use of chemical pesticides to control cocoa pests increased yield by up to 244% in 
1960 and saved 70,000 tons from destruction }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Youdeowei and Service, 1983)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057

Individuals resistant to pesticides do not simply arise as a result of exposing insects to sublethal doses of insecticides, nor through mutation; a very small number of resistant individuals already exist in populations before any insecticide use. <#/>Whe

 insecticides are applied, resistance confers selective advantage to resistant individuals; their susceptible neighbours are killed, but genetic selection favouring the increase of resistant individuals and at some point the population, is said to have de

\par <#/>Resistance to DDT appeared in houseflies as soon as DDT was introduced in 1946. <#/>Four years later resistance appeared in mosquitoes, and by 1980, there were 432 species of arthropods resistant to at l
east one pesticide (171 of medical and veterinary and 261 of agricultural importance). <#/>The current figure must be much higher, considering that the resistant arthropod species more than doubled between 1960 and 1980. <#/>By 1976, at least seven specie

\par <#/>Between 80-90% of the human population in Africa lives in rural areas where subsistent or resource poor farmers practice traditional mixed cro
pping agriculture on small farms e.g. <#/>2 ha./family. <#/>In most countries, a major proportion of agricultural effort (75%) is put into the production of staples (maize, sorghum, millet, cassava, teff and grain legumes) and a further 10% of the effort 
is devoted to other food crops, e.g. wheat, plantains, bananas, sweet and Irish potatoes. <#/>Comparatively little effort, is devoted to industrial crops, e.g. coffee, tea, cotton, groundnuts, cashewnuts and tobacco (Odhiambo, 1977).
\par <#/>In order to increas
e food production in Africa, appropriate new technologies are needed for staple food crops (Mensah, 1989). <#/>Unfortunately, research efforts in this century have instead been focused on major industrial crops. <#/>Thus, very little research has been don
e on some indigenous crops that have great potential in tropical Africa, e.g. millet and bananas (Odhiambo, 1977).
\par <#/>Research on traditional farming practices in Africa is essential for increasing food production. <#/>Unfortunately, our strategy for prote
ction of crops against pests in Africa has been based on research studies on single crops or single pest species. <#/>Indeed, as stated by Odhiambo (1984), this approach may be appropriate in temperate regions where the monocrop system is the prevailing t
r
adition, and where floras and faunas are poor in species and diversity. <#/>However, in tropical Africa, where intercropping is the main system of farming, using monocrop entomology to try to solve pest problems arising from intercropping systems is both 
i
rrelevant and inappropriate. <#/>Fortunately, several African leaders are now becoming aware of the importance of research and pest management. <#/>The Lagos Plan of Action for the Economic Development of Africa 1980-2000, formulated by the heads of state
 and governments meeting in Lagos in April 1980 recognized pest management as one of the crucial elements in Africa's fight to seek food security (Odhiambo, 1984}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 )}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 .}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 </X>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057

\par <#/>Malaria remains the leading public health problem in many tropical countries. <#/>Nearly 90 million people were estimated to be affected by malaria in 1981}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  (WHO, 1984)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>In 
1974, malaria ranked third among the leading causes of death in Kenya }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Roberts, 1974)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>Malaria ranges from hyper- to holoendemic in Western and coastal regions of Kenya and spleen rates above 75% among children under 10 years of age are common }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (DVBD, unpublished reports)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>It has been noted that only about 1-5% of children develop severe, life-threatening disease in areas where all children will be infected during infancy and childhood. <#/>The mortality of severe malaria is high, and many patients die shortly after rec
eiving treatment }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (WHO, 1986)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>The clinical characteristics of malaria differ between different geographical areas and within each area, being influenced by factors such as seasonal variation in transmission, age of the infected patients, species and int
ensity of parasitemia, access to antimalarial treatment and other probably unknown variables }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Bruce-chwatt }{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 et al}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 , 1985; Quinn }{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 et al}{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 , }{
\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 1986)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>It is therefore important that the factors which contribute to the severity of infection be examined. <#/>In add
ition, the level of community education and cultural values may contribute toward the development of severe disease }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (McCormack, 1984)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>In this regard, the important questions to be considered include:- (a) What are the vector-related factors associated
 with the severity of malaria as a disease attacking a population which is exposed to intense transmission? <#/>(b) Is there any association between severity of disease and vector infectivity? <#/>(c) Are individuals residing in households with higher ent
o
mological inoculation rates more likely to develop severe clinical malaria? <#/>In order to answer the above questions a stepwise series of field studies to examine natural variation at different micro-environmental levels (house to house) will be conduct
ed at selected sites. <#/>Kilifi District is an area with many differing ecotypes. <#/>It is served by 2 government hospitals, 6 health centres and 40 dispensaries. <#/>Malaria vector control has not been attempted in this area to date.
\par <#/>A KEMRI-Oxford University team has established that the distribution of severe and non-severe cases of malaria come from }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
large area surrounding Kilifi district hospital and normally cluster in time and space. <#/>Most of the cases occur from June to September and from December to January }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Snow and Marsh, pers. comm)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>It is believed that there are geographic differences in levels of malaria transmission. <#/>Attempts will be made to relate entomological variables to clinical and parasitological findings in order to identify risk factors at the household level acc
ording to ecological zones. <#/>The knowledge gained should be helpful in designing more effective control measures.
\par <#/>A KEMRI-Oxford University team in 1985-86 reported parasite rates of about 50.7% (N= 4,654), with }{\b\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 P. falciparum}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  predominating (}{\b\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 P. falciparum}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 : }{

 infections rates ranged from 4% to 92% in children 2-9 years of age, demonstrating considerable variation among villages. <#/>Studies of Bancroftian filariasis conducted in rural site near Kilifi more than ten years ago indicated that }{
\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 Anopheles}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  fauna inside houses consisted of 95% of }{\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 An. funestus }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 and 5% }{\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 An. gambiae}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  s.l. }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057

\par <#/>The purpose of this study is to measure vector specific inoculation rates and vector dynamic
s as it relates to the severity of disease. <#/>These studies will be closely integrated with the clinical epidemiological and entomological studies currently being conducted in Kilifi District.

\par <#/>Malaria transmission rates
 can be influenced by a number of factors including innate host preferences, host numbers, and host accessibility to mosquitoes. <#/>Human contact with mosquitoes may be altered through cultural practices which affect the abundance and location of both hu
man and domestic animals. <#/>For example, seasonal migrational habits bring humans into closer contact with vectors and have been correlated to differences in malaria parasite prevalence in Thailand }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Burkort }{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057

\par <#/>In areas of stable malaria endemicity, the prevalence of malaria infection approaches 100%. <#/>There is clinical progression from uninfected to infected to clinically ill to severe}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
illness to death. <#/>Thus:-
\par Uninfected ------ > infected ----- > clinically ill ----- > severe illness ----- > death.
\par <#/>Most epidemiological studies focus on understanding the first two of these transitions. <#/>Less is known about causes of subsequent transitions in the development of clinical malaria and more so a
s it relates to vector-related causes. <#/>The relationships between parasite, vector, and man have been applied in developing antimalarial strategies. <#/>However, difficulties have been encountered in using such applications owing to the <-/inadequancy>
 of baseline data and/or the lack satisfactory estimates of some factors governing transmission of the disease. <#/>In the proposed study, vector related epidemiological factors considered as potential determinants of severe malaria will be evaluated.

\par <#/>The risk of infection for individuals living in an endemic area depends upon exposure to infected }{\b\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 Anopheles}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  and therefore, it }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <+_is>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
hypothesized that the distribution of clinically severe malaria cases should be related to the distribution of infected }{\b\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 Anopheles}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  vectors.
\par <#/>The epidemiological situation of malaria in a country or locality is by no means uniform and so the number of clinical episodes of malaria experienced by an individual in a household should be related to exposure levels to infected }{
\b\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 Anopheles}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/><-_To><+_For> most effective control it is essential to identify epidemiological factors in terms of the following parameters; vector characteristics (relative <-/abudance> of species, gonotrophic cycles and survival rates), feeding patterns, spo
rozoite rates, and house factors. <#/>These factors are of considerable epidemiological significance in the transmission of disease.
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 OBJECTIVES}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  </h>
\par <#/>1. <#/>To determine anopheline species composition and abundance in relation to malaria transmission intensity and illness at two ecologically distinct sites.
\par <#/>2. <#/>To assess the relationship between the entomological inoculation rates in households with children having severe malaria and households with children having mild malaria.
\par <#/>3. <#/>To identify vector related features of households which contain cases of severe and non-severe malaria.
\par <h> <#/>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND METHODS </h>
\par <#/>The current WHO funded case control study has documented clinical disease in certain households, therefore defining households as generating degrees of severe illness. <#/>These will be used as sampling households within an area which has been accurat
ely mapped and enumerated as part of a study to identify socioeconomic and behavioural factors in the determination of severe disease }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (PhD Thesis, Mrs H. Mwenesi, TDR-SER funded)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>Prospective recruitment of severe, non-severe and community controls will
 continue until May 1992, and thus carrying out the study in these selected areas will generate further households. <#/>Prospective parasitological screens for malaria parasites and active morbidity surveillance in both adults and children will be carried
 out monthly in the identified households. <#/>In the same households sampling for vector dynamics will be done. <#/>The }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>orth>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
Principal investigator will be trained in the development of immunological techniques for vector field studies.
\par <h> <#/>Study area </h>
\par <#/>Studies will be conducted in Kilifi District, Coast province. <#/>Kilifi borders the Indian ocean and lies about 400 km south of the equator between latitudes 3 and 4 degrees. <#/>There is dense forest vegetation as well as savannah; elevatio
n ranges from 0 to 400 m above sea level. <#/>Rainfall averages >1,000 mm per year with a long rainy season from April to June and a short rainy season in September and October. <#/>It is hot and humid all the year round with daily temperatures ranging fr
om 22 to 30 degrees centigrade. <#/>Within the study area there are an estimated 50-70,000 people, mostly subsistence farmers growing mangoes}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 ,}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 maize, cassava, cashew and coconut. <#/>The predominant ethnic group is the Mijikenda of which about 70% belong to
 the <-/Giriyama> tribal group. <#/>This area was selected based on accessibility to Kilifi town where there is a district hospital; about 75% of in-patients with severe malaria reside within the study area. <#/>Most are referred from out-patient faciliti
es in the district. <#/>In the same area the KEMRI-OXFORD team is carrying out clinical epidemiological studies on the severity of malaria in children.

\par <#/>With the advances in medi
cal science and health care delivery systems in many parts of the world, there has been a corresponding improvement in various <-/morbidities> and <-/mortalities>. <#/>Most notable is the improved survival of new-born babies, especially the preterm. <#/>A
s a result, the definition of abortion and viability of a foetus has undergone continuous revision, from the original 28 weeks of gestation cut-off point down to 24 weeks and then down to 20 weeks of gestation or a foetal weight of 500 grams.
\par <#/>This means
 that studies done in the same place over different periods (say, 1975 and 1985) may not be comparable in all aspects since their cut-off points are different. <#/>Secondly, even studies done recently may employ different definitions of abortion because t
h
e researchers were not familiar with the changes or for some other reasons. <#/>As evidenced from the studies done in Kenya so far, some workers have continued to use the 28-week cut-off point, while others have used the 20-week or 500-gram foetal weight.

\par <#/>Most of the earlier studies used the older definition. <#/>However, some of the more recent studies have continued to use the same cut-off point. <#/>One may appreciate the dilemma faced by researchers working within the community in as far as the cut
-
off points are concerned, especially in remote places where most of the abortions are done very late in pregnancy. <#/>It is not clear, however, why the hospital-based ones have continued to use it. <#/>Looking at the studies done in Kenya with regards to
 
definition of abortion, one notes a lot of disparity. <#/>While they may not all be comparable in a number of aspects, they have nevertheless helped in highlighting abortion, its potential magnitude and related problems. <#/>Only a few of the more recent 
s
tudies have used the latest definition of 20 weeks or 500-gram foetal weight. <#/>Some of the studies did not specify the gestational ages, either because they were not specifically looking at this aspect of abortion, or all of their study population were
 of low gestational periods because of the type of technique or study.}{\f0\fs24\lang2057\super

Definitions help in standardizing methodology and ensuring comparability of results (data). <#/>These points are worth taking into consideration when looking at the differen
t study results, otherwise there may be a lot of bias and wrong conclusions being drawn.
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 Magnitude and regional variations}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  </h>
\par <#/>The actual magnitude of abortion is not and may never be known. <#/>It is difficult if not impossible to establish i
t on a hospital or local let alone national level. <#/>Abortion is still regarded as secret by most people, mainly because of its social, moral and legal connotations. <#/>Even when spontaneous, very few people talk openly or even privately about it. <#/>
Secrecy becomes even more pronounced when the abortion is induced.
\par <#/>Abortions are usually induced or done secretly and do not get on to any record in hospitals, clinics or the community. <#/>The cases that normally get to the hospital are considered the 
tip of the iceberg. <#/>They are the few women who sustain some form of complication \emdash  severe haemorrhage with or without shock, sepsis, organ injuries \emdash 
 which may compel them to seek medical attention (if they survive the ordeal long enough to reach a hea
lth facility). <#/>A majority of the induced and some of the spontaneous abortions do not sustain any complications warranting medical attention. <#/>Some of the abortion cases may be admitted with other diagnoses such as urinary retention, acute renal fa
i
lure acute cardiac failure, severe anaemia, pelvic abscess, tubo-ovarian mass, tetanus, pneumonia, subphrenic abscess, deep venous thrombosis, malaria, pyrexia of unknown origin or dysentery. <#/>Since the patients may not give or may not be able to give 
a
ppropriate histories, the truth may never be known. <#/>Abortion cases may also be missed in a very busy medical institution, or when the attending doctors overlook the possibility of induced abortion leading to the patient's presenting symptoms. <#/>Thes
e omissions are not unusual even in the best of institutions. <#/>The results are inaccurate figures and incidence/proportions of abortions as well as misrepresentation of the related complications. 
\par <#/>There may also be considerable arbitrary regional var
iations (either hospital to hospital, or location to location) because of record-keeping or because there are different numbers of women in the sexually active bracket (15 - 45 years) in some areas. <#/>There may be more induced abortions, and since the t
e
chniques used are more hazardous more women sustain serious complications and go to hospital. <#/>The availability and accessibility of a medical facility is another factor as are the different values attached to fertility, marital customary values/practi
ces, sexual relations and taboos, or educational level of the woman. <#/>There may also be more abortion service providers in the larger urban centres.
\par <#/>While it is generally accepted that abortion and especially induced abortion is more common among young single urban women, recent studies have shown that this is not invariably so.
\par <#/>Some of the hospital-based studies have shown that the incidence of abortion varies considerably even in the same institution. <#/>Nyakeri found an incidence of 43.3%, Aggarwal }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 et al. }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
reported it to be 60.5% of all gynaecological admissions, while Fomulu had 51.9%. <#/>Mutungi obtained a figure of 50.2% of all acute gynaecological admissions and Omuga got an incidence of 61.4% of all gynaecological emergency admissions. <#/
>Mati stated that the total number of abortion admissions rose from 1,838 in 1971 to 3,048 in 1975 at the same institution. <#/>Variations have also been noted in the studies done elsewhere. <#/>Njuki reported an incidence of 62.5% of all acute gynaecolog
ical admissions at the Nakuru Provincial General Hospital, while Lema }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 et al. }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
had different incidences in the eight hospitals under study: 13.4% at Kisii District Hospital, 28.1% at Kitui, 35.0% at Bungoma, 42.3% at Kajiado, 51.6% at Chogoria and 74.5% at Malindi District Hospital.}{\f0\fs24\lang2057\super 
\par }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>The denominator used in these studies varied from acute/emergency gynaecological to total gynaecological admissions. <#/>Furthermore, the number and types of gynaecological admissions vary depending on the location and availabi
lity of services and expertise to treat them. <#/>The more equipped the hospital is in terms of specialized facilities and expertise, the more and varied the admissions. <#/>This may lead to lowering of the incidence of any particular condition.
\par <#/>The pe
riod of study may also influence variation in incidence as there are some peak and low seasons for abortions, e.g. <#/>a few months or weeks following festival seasons or during school holidays when conjugal relations are more likely to occur for those wh
o
 are restricted at other times. <#/>Ferguson found that most of the pregnancies responsible for drop-outs were conceived during school holidays. <#/>Therefore, studies done around these peak times may lead to a higher incidence, and those done during the 
low seasons may give low incidence. <#/>The studies covering longer periods may give a relatively more realistic incidence. <#/>All these facts must be taken into account when comparing various study results or referring to a particular one.
\par <#/>Notwithstan
ding these shortfalls, the studies have shown that abortion is one of the most common reasons for admission into Kenyan hospitals. <#/>As Mati pointed out, the acute gynaecological ward of Kenyatta National Hospital admits about one-sixth of all admission
s to the hospital out of whom an average of 60.0% are due to abortion. <#/>Njuki stresses further that out of the four theatres available at the Nakuru General Hospital, one is reserved wholly for evacuations.}{\f0\fs24\lang2057\super

\par }\pard\plain \s89\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<#/>Much emphasi
s has been placed on attempts to categorize abortion as either induced or non-induced (spontaneous), based on various criteria. <#/>This effort reflects the desire to identify the magnitude/proportion of induced abortion, the reasons for termination, char
a
cteristics of women concerned, methods used and their outcomes (complications). <#/>The desire for categorization came about as a result of observations made in day-to-day life and in hospital settings: some of the women who have had abortions volunteer a
 
history of interference, while those who deny such a history reveal tell-tale signs suggestive of probable interference and when pressed further sometimes admit to the fact. <#/>Secondly, there is something peculiar about the socio-demographic characteris
tics, reproductive histories and complications of the women with induced abortion compared with those with non-induced abortion.
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \f56\fs20 {<#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 The proportions of induced
 abortion have been quite variable for several reasons. <#/>Very few women will admit to a history of interference, even when there are obvious signs. <#/>On the other hand, some induced abortions leave no tell-tale indicators so that even to the most exp
e
rienced doctor, and depending on the presentation of the patient, such a woman may pass unnoticed. <#/>Thirdly, the criteria used are not uniform and are indeed very subjective. <#/>Fourthly, the complications which may compel one to seek medical attentio
n are also quite variable. <#/>Some of the induced may have none at all, whereas some of the non-induced (spontaneous) may have very serious complications and may therefore be labelled otherwise.
\par <#/>Variations also reflect the criteria used which have incl
uded definite history of interference by the woman; finding of foreign bodies in the uterus, vagina or cervix; evidence of sepsis either local or generalized; purulent vaginal discharge; injury to the genitalia; unwantedness of a pregnancy; being single a
n
d/or in school/college; or non-contraception at conception of the index pregnancy. <#/>While these may all contribute, they are not invariably causal factors. <#/>An additional cause of variation in the proportion of induced abortion is the differences in
 the study populations used e.g. the denominators.
\par <#/>Aggarwal }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 et al. }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 reported that 35.6% of the study group volunteered a history of interference, while a further 26.7% had features suggestive of probable interference such as unwanted pregnancy and sepsis
. <#/>Baker and Khasiani based their categorization on history as the women were either known to the interviewers or some of the interviewees. <#/>Lema }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 et al. }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
based their categorization on the patient's history and the attending doctor's opinion which was 
based on finding foreign bodies in the uterus, genital injuries or social history of the woman such as being a student or a prostitute. <#/>Many relied on the history of the respondents, while others did not specify the criteria used in their studies.}{
\f0\fs24\lang2057\super 
\par }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>
Based on these criteria, the proportion of induced abortion has varied from 10.7% to 62.5% of all abortions. <#/>Also, there is a lot of variation from one district hospital to another. <#/>Proportions of 62.3%, 28.0% and 17.6% were all noted at the same 
institution, Kenyatta National Hospital.}{\f0\fs24\lang2057\super l}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
\par <#/>The experiences of most workers is that induced abortions are more frequent than have hitherto been reported in the literature. <#/>It therefore means that when considering induced abortion as reported in studie
s, one has to be aware of all these facts and give an allowance for possible under-reporting. <#/>Secondly it perhaps calls for a design of more elaborate criteria which may have less "false-negatives".
\par <#/>Abortion is regarded as being induced when there has been a deliberate attempt by the woman to terminate the pregnancy either by herself or by another person. <#/>Most workers believe that induced abortions form the majority.
\par <#/>Induced abortion has existed from far back in history. <#/>It has been used
 as a method of regulating fertility either in the absence of contraception or as an <-/adjuvant> to it in cases of failure. <#/>For some people and societies around the world it is the only method of fertility regulation, while for others it is used in c
onjunction with some form of contraception.
\par <#/>Though previously thought to be the problem of the young single urban "educated" women, studies done in Kenya so far have shown that induced abortion is not limited to them. <#/>All the studies which have been
 done in the rural communities of Kenya have shown that induced abortion has been and continues to prevail in the rural areas as well. <#/>Apart from the 1989 study by Lema }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 et al., }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
the other hospital-based studies did not specify the residence of the woman at the time of conception of the index pregnancy or of the abortion. <X_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
<#/>Most hospitals are situated in urban areas so that whether a woman resides in an urban or rural area, if she has a medical problem she would have to go to an urban area. <#/>It is, t
herefore, very possible that some of the induced abortions seen in these hospitals are of women from rural areas, which would mean that the rural contribution has been under-estimated.
\par <#/>The reasons for terminating a pregnancy are very diverse. <#/>Most 
of the studies which have looked into these causes have shown that unwantedness of a pregnancy is the main reason. <#/>A pregnancy may not be accepted/wanted because it is conceived at an inappropriate time in the woman's/couple's life (lives), e.g. when 
i
t occurs pre-maritally, if the girl is too young, still in school or soon after the birth of another child. <#/>It may also result from unacceptable or prohibited sexual union e.g. rape, incest, extra-marital, other traditional or cultural taboos. <#/>At 
o
ther times, it may occur when the woman/couple has had the number of children they desire and/or can cater for adequately, or may be financially or otherwise constrained to have another one. <#/>An unwanted pregnancy may also result from a failure of cont
raception. <#/>In some cases there is more than one reason.}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057\super 
\par }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>There are traditional methods of interrupting pregnancies which have and still continue to be used in some communities of Kenya. <#/>These are basically practised in the more traditional societ
ies where there has been very little external influence. <#/>Some of these are still being used in areas that are slightly more advanced (developed). <#/>However, in most cases induced abortions are performed by newer (modern) methods. <#/>The traditional
 
methods include ingestion of various herbal preparations; intrauterine insertion of foreign bodies such as sticks or roots of specific types of trees; uterine massage; ingestion of domestic excreta or droppings; foetal strangulation; intrauterine surgery.
 
<#/>Some of these techniques e.g. the insertion of foreign bodies, are still being used, the only difference being the kind of gadgets used. <#/>These now include knitting needles, bicycle spokes, catheters, pens, iron rods, intrauterine contraceptive dev
ices, hangers.}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057\super 
\par }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
<#/>Uterine surgery as practised traditionally may be equated with dilatation and curettage (aspiration menstrual regulation) of today. <#/>The only difference may be the gestational age at the time they are done. <#/>Other non-traditional me
thods include ingestion of chemical preparations such as detergents, writing ink, drugs; instillation of chemicals e.g. saline or prostaglandins into the uterine cavity.}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057\super 
\par }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Of late there has been an upsurge of interest in induced abortion in many parts of
 the world. <#/>One of the reasons is a desire to establish the magnitude/proportion of induced abortion in as wide an area as possible. <#/>Other reasons are a need to identify the explanations for the terminations, the socio-demographic characteristics 
of the women and of the men responsible for the pregnancies, the methods/techniques used, the people who abet in the procurement, the place and timing, the cost of the service, and the final outcomes/complications .
\par <#/>The studies which have looked at indu
ced abortion in Kenya have all shown that it is mainly a problem of the young single women who are dependent on others for their livelihood. <#/>The married, more mature and independent are less involved. <#/>The reasons include the fact that a higher pro
p
ortion of the young people are becoming sexually active at fairly early ages and rarely use any reliable method of contraception. <#/>The consequence is often an unwanted and unplanned pregnancy which has to be terminated somehow. <#/>The more mature and/
or married women are already in secure sexual relations, are regularly practising contraception or do not have such indiscriminate conjugal relations.
\par <#/>The decision to abort/terminate the pregnancy is in most cases the woman's own. <#/>She does not invol
ve her male counterpart even when married. <#/>In the rare cases when the man is involved he suggests or in fact recommends the abortion. <#/>This again underlines the secretive nature of induced abortion and perhaps indicates that possibly a good proport
ion of the induced abortions among married women may in fact be because the pregnancies are from extra-marital relations. 
\par <#/>It is not surprising therefore that many women seek abortion service on their own or do the termination themselves by ingesting he
rbal preparations or animal excreta. <#/>Others may seek the services of "traditional" or local "experts", approach friends who may assist them or go to medical or paramedical people. <#/>All these are utilized to varying degrees in different areas and by
 
different women in different circumstances. <#/>It depends on the availability of the particular service or individual, the cost involved, awareness on the part of the woman or her friend(s) whom she may approach, her level of education, residence and soc
io-economic potential.
\par <#/>The cost of procuring an abortion tends to vary. <#/>It may range from nothing to as much as Kshs 10,000 and depends on the woman concerned, her economic potential, social status, the service provider, the gestational age, and whe
re it is performed. <#/>The places vary also, depending more or less on the same factors, and include one's own home, a friend's place, an office, hotel rooms, clinics or hospitals.
\par <#/>All these facts have been looked at in some of the studies done in Ken
ya, though very few. <#/>They, as well as others not already looked at, are worth studying in greater detail for they contribute significantly to the final outcome of the termination as shown below.

t the gestational age at the time of abortion and the primary aetiology, the methods used for the induction and the complications. <#/>It has been shown that most abortions due to foetal abnormalities, especially those due to chromosomal defects, tend to 
o
ccur in the first trimester; those due to failure of accommodation, i.e. uterine or cervical abnormalities, normally occur in the second trimester. <#/>Evidence also abounds to the fact that a good proportion of the induced abortions are usually done afte
r
 the first two months, i.e. after eight weeks of gestation and normally in the first part of the second trimester. <#/>This is basically because a woman who may not have planned to conceive may not be sure or want to believe that she is pregnant after mis
s
ing one menstrual period. <#/>After the second missed period she realizes that she may in fact be pregnant as she starts to experience some symptoms of pregnancy or unusual symptoms. <#/>These may make her go to hospital where she may be told the truth, o
r
 if she has had previous experience she will know without asking that she is in fact pregnant. <#/>It is normally after this realization that she starts thinking of what to do, and by the time she is able to do anything a further four weeks or so will hav
e elapsed. <#/>For those seeking legal termination there may be a delay because of the lengthy process involved.
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \f56\fs20 {\v <#/>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 A lot of effort has been put into identifying this aspect of abortion in Kenya. <#/>In addition to trying to correlate gestational age at ab

the studies that have specifically looked into it have shown that most induced abortions occur late i.e. <#/>after the first eight weeks of gestation. <#/>For most, the peak gestational age has been 12 to 16 weeks.
\par <#/>Aggarwal and Mati found that the mean 
gestational age was 15.8 weeks for septic abortions, which were felt to be induced, and 11.4 weeks for the non-septic, which they thought were non-induced. <#/>Fomulu, working at the same place, found that 43.9% of the abortions had occurred between 13 an
d 20 weeks and that this was the peak, while Maranga had a peak of 11 to 15 weeks at the same place for both the induced and the non-induced. <#/>Kizza found that the peak for all the patients was 13 to 16 weeks. <#/>Lema }{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 et al. }{

\par <#/>In March 1990, a pest that was causing the drying up of cypress trees was reported in Kiserian area, Ngong Division of Kadiado District. }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Kenya Farmer, November 1990}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 ). <#/>The pest known as the cypress aphid }
{\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 Cinara cupressi}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  Buckton attacks the twigs and branches of host trees resulting in their dieback and drying up of heavily infested trees in Cupressaceae family. <#/>It affects cedar, cypress and callistries trees.

\par <#/>The cypress aphid is an exotic pest whose natural habitat is in Europe where it feeds on species of }{\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 Cupressus, Juniperus}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  and }{\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 Thuga}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057

well known how or when the pest found its way to Africa. <#/>It has been positively recorded from cypress plantations in the Southern highlands of Tanzania, Burundi and Rwanda where extensive damage has been reported from all plantations of susceptible sp

\par <#/>Aphids are an extremely successful group which occurs throughout the
 world with the greatest number of species in the temperate regions. <#/>Individually they are inconspicuous and small but they can become quite numerous. <#/>Many species are agricultural pests and tree dwelling aphids can severely retard their host plan
ts. <#/>Aphids originated from the Archescytinidae in the carboniferous era, or early permian, 280 million years ago }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Dixon, 1973).}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
\par <#/>Aphids are small soft bodied insects frequently found in large numbers sucking sap from stems, twigs and leaves of plants
 hence termed plant lice. <#/>They also affect roots. <#/>A conspiuous evolution of aphids was later associated with the appearance of flowering plants, the angiosperms and the host plants of most present day aphids are angiosperms although some aphids li
ve on gymnosperms and a few species attack ferns and mosses}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  (Dixon, 1973).}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
\par <#/>They are members of the order Homopotera, Family Aphididae. <#/>They have piercing and sucking mouthparts comprising of four stylets made up of two mandibles enclosing two maxill
ae. <#/>Within the stylet complex are a salivary channel and a food channel }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Dixon, 1973}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
). <#/>Females and usually also males have functional mouthparts. <#/>All aphids feed on sap. <#/>Most aphids obtain food from the sieve tubes. <#/>pressure }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>orth}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 of
 phloem cells to force sap up the very fine food canal in the styles but for aphids feeding on artificial diets they probably use the cibarial pump to suck up their food. }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Dixon, 1973)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
\par <#/>Aphids have four wings if alatae. <#/>The forewings are uniform in 
texture being <-/mebranous> throughout or slightly <-/leatherly>. <#/>The hind wings are always <-/mebranous>. <#/>Forewings are larger than hindwings. <#/>The wings are held rooflike at rest with inner margins overlapping slightly at the apex. <#/>Winged
 condition is not always observed with some groups having winged and wingless individuals of the same or different sex. }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Borror, 1971}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
). <#/>Typically there are many structurally different morphs in a species including both sexual and asexual forms. <#/>Polymorphism, which is the development within a species of several different adult forms is characteristic of aphids. }{
\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Dixon, 1973). }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Winged forms can usually be recognized by the venation and relative size of the front and hind wings.
\par <#/>The winged condit
ion is thought to be more primitive condition in aphids and the apterous condition to have been a later evolutionary development probably through brachypterousness. <#/>Usually, apterae are more fecund than alatae. <#/>Alatae being colonizers are subject 
t
o different selection pressures from those acting on apterae. <#/>This may account for alatae producing small offspring and also a larger proportion of their offspring soon after maturation than do apterae As such they can maintain a rapid rate of increas
e
 <-/equaling> that of apterae in certain species. <#/>The initial advantage of apterousness was an increase in fecundity because the development and maintenance of wing musculature possibly competes with development of embryos for the limited amount of ni
trogen available to the aphid. }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Dixon, 1973)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
\par <#/>Aphids are also characterised by a pear-shaped body with a pair of cornicles (siphunculi) at the posterior end of abdomen situated dorsally on the fifth or sixth abdominal segments. <#/>They have fairly long 
antennae and tarsi are two segmented with two claws. <#/>Aphids are notably relatively inactive }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Borror, 1971).}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
\par <h> <#/>2:1:1:2 Reproduction and lifecycles </h>
\par <#/>The life cycles of many aphids are rather unusual and complex. <#/>Aphids are distinguished
 from other groups in the Aphidoidea in that the females of at least a few generations do not require fertilization for the development of their embryos and also in that these asexual females are viviparous. <#/>they }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>orth}{
\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 may possess or lack wings. <#/
>Aphids are parthenogenetic and viviparous for most of the year but are also capable of sexual reproduction with the production of fertilized eggs. <#/>The gonads of the female consist of two ovaries, each composed of from 4 to 6 ovaries. <#/>At the dista
l
 end of each ovariole is a germarium from which the eggs are ovulated. <#/>In virginoparae eggs begin development without fertilization. <#/>Ovaricles of newly born parthenogenetic females contain embryos. <#/>Thus a mother can have in its ovarioles embry
os which in turn have developing embryos, the future grand-daughters. <#/>Embryos or eggs pass to the exterior via an oviduct.
\par <#/>Aphids appear to show diploid parthenogenesis i.e. no reduction division and development starts from a cell containing a full complement of chromosome including 2x chromosomes. <#/>Males are produced by the loss of an x chromosome at the first divisio
n and they produce haploid sperm which contain an x chromosome only.
\par <#/>Fertilization of haploid eggs of sexual females result in diploid cells with 2x chromosomes thus aphids hatching from fertilized eggs are all females. <#/>Parthenogenesis enables those
 aphids that survive adverse conditions to produce others like themselves, also capable of surviving in that environment and thus rapidly increase in numbers}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  (Dixon, 1973).}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
\par <#/>Most species overwinter in egg stage, eggs hatching in spring into females. <#/
>Several generations may be reproduced parthenogenetically The first generations usually consist of apterae but later alatae appear. <#/>These may migrate to different host plant and reproductive process continues and later in the season they migrate back
 to the original host type and a generation of both sexes appears. <#/>This is for aphids that show host alternation. <#/>For aphids with only one host type no migration occurs and different sexes mate, females produce eggs which overwinter }{
\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Borror, 1971).}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
\par <#/>Some aphids never produce sexuals and thus no eggs. <#/>They exist parthenogenetically throughout the year and are termed anholocyclic. <#/>Still some host alternating species have both holocyclic and anholocyclic clones }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
(Dixon, 1973).}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
\par <h> <#/>2:1:1:3 The Winged Condition </h>
\par <#/>Winged aphids may be fundatrices, virginoparae, oviparae and males.
\par <#/>Some factors have been implicated in the development of alate forms. <#/>These are crowding, quality of the host plant, ant attendance, temperature and ph
otoperiod and intrinsic factors. <#/>Crowding seems the most important factor. <#/>The juvenile hormone affects the development of wings and pigmentation during nympal development. <#/>It comes from the corpus allata. <#/>Embryos can also be induced to de
velop into sexual forms after birth by a hormone produced by neurosecretory cells in the brain. }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Dixon, 1973)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
\par <h> <#/>2:1:1:4 Migration and Flight </h>
\par <#/>Aphids migrate great distances, <-/upto> 1300 <-/kilometers>. <#/>Aphids move from plant to plant mos
t conspicuously by flight. <#/>During the day the air just above the ground is warmest and tends to rise. <#/>Aphids flying during the day are likely to be carried into the upper air by convention currents. <#/>Consequently most flying aphids are at heigh
t
s in excess of 30 metres. <#/>At sunset, the air above the ground becomes cooler than the air above and convection ceases. <#/>Thus aphids are likely to be carried to high altitudes and brought back to ground level by atmospheric circulation alone. <#/>At
m
ospheric circulation dominates the aphids' movements because of their low flight speeds, 1.6 to 3.2 km/h relative to the speed of air. <#/>As the air in which aphids fly usually moves faster than 3 km/h the aphids have scarcely any control over where they
 are going and can be carried for great distances. <#/>They can settle only if they stop flying or if air movement brings them to the ground. }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Dixon, 1973)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
\par <#/>Many aphids show bimodal flight periodicity with a peak in numbers in mid-morning and another in 
the early afternoon. <#/>Number flying each day is governed by number moulting to the adult stage; the length of the teneral period of the adult alate aphid and the weather affecting take off. <#/>Usually tree dwelling aphids fly in very calm conditions. 
}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Dixon, 1973)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
\par <#/>Energy for flight is obtained from respiration of glycogen first then fats. <#/>In fat respiration water is released enabling maintenance of aphid's water content even after prolonged flight. <#/>Aphids do not fly to exhaustion before alig
hting and they take flight again if they settle on a non-host plant. <#/>On landing, aphids invariably probe the surface and this initial probe, taking less than a minute determines whether an aphid will settle or leave. <#/>However not all aphids settle 
indiscriminately with regard to plant species. <#/>Aphids taking off for the first time show a strong attraction to short wave light which take them up into the sky, and away from plants. <X_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
<#/>After a period of upward flight, this attraction wanes and aphids
 are then attracted to sources of long wave light. <#/>In the fields, they alight preferentially on leaves reflecting a greater proportion of longer wavelengths of light, irrespective of plant species. <#/>The attraction of many species to yellow serves t
o draw aphids towards plants of the optimum physiological age, those actively growing or senescent hence most nutritious (Dixon, 1973}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 ).</X>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057

<#/>The objectives of this study were firstly to identify the phlebotomine sandflies found in Nairobi. <#/>Secondly
, to assess their abundance and relate the effects of seasonal changes on sandfly population, and thirdly to determine if sandfly species existing in the Nairobi area may be potential vectors of leishmaniasis. <#/>Nairobi is closely situated to the Athi R

\par <h> <#/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Study sites}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  </h>
\par <#/>Three study sites namely, Langata, Kibera and Roysambu in the Nairobi area were selected. <#/>The sites were identified through a preliminary survey to
 determine areas where sandflies were abundant and where there were reports by inhabitants of bites by flies other than mosquitoes.

\par <#/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 The sticky trap method. <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Castor oil traps adapted from the devices used by Petrisheva (1935) and Blasova (1932) both cited by Kirk and Lewis (1940) were used. <#/>Transparent polythene sheets
\par <#/>1 x 1 m and 0.25 mm thick devised by Mutinga (1981), were coated with castor oil on b
oth surfaces and fixed near resting sites of sandflies as described by Mutinga (1981). <#/>These sheets were held by strings in and outside houses, in the forest near tree trunks, caves and near termite mounds.
\par <#/>The sandflies were expected to be trapped
 as they flew in and out of their habitats or as they came into houses to feed. <#/>Similar sheets measuring 20 x 30 cm were also used. <#/>These sheets were fixed on forked sticks and inserted into small animal burrows on cracks in the ground. <#/>The sh
e
ets were also rolled and placed in the ventilation shafts of termite mounds and sandflies were trapped as they hopped in and out of the shafts. <#/>A total of 30 traps were placed at the sites in the evening at 1830 hr and removed in the morning at 0700 h
r
, three nights a week for a period of 6 months (November 1989 to April 1990). <#/>The trapped sandflies were then picked from the transparent sheets since they were easily distinguished from other dipterans. <#/>A fine camel hair brush (No. 2) was used to
 remove the sandflies from the sheet. <#/>The sandflies were then placed in specimen tubes which were well labelled and contained detergent saline.
\par <#/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 The light trap method. <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Light traps used were a modification of the Smith and Downes' (1970) CDC light
 traps consisting of a plexiglass body, a horizontal screen mesh, a torch bulb (three volts), a plastic fan and a removable collecting sandfly net. <#/>The light traps were operated at a height of 1-1.5 m above the ground for three trap nights a week for 
3 months (November 1989-December 1989 and January 1990). <#/>Sandflies were sorted out from other dipterans caught in the net the following morning.
\par <#/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Human bait method . <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 This method was developed by Kerr (1933). <#/>It is an important method of sampl
ing anthropophilic sandflies and this was the main reason why the method was employed in this study. <#/>An assistant sat on a stool around the termite hills late in the evening from 1830 to 0700 hr in the morning when sandflies were very active. <#/>The 
assistant exposed his legs and arms. <#/>It was hoped that unfed anthropophilic species would be attracted to the human bait for a blood meal. <#/>This exercise was carried out three times a week for 2 months (March and April 1991).
\par <#/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Aspiration. <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Aspi
rators used were similar in design to those described by Peffiliev (1968) and Rioux et al. <#/>(1969). <#/>Sandflies were aspirated from crevices in trees, cracks and fissures in soil and other apertures in rocks. <#/>Torches were used to limit the restin
g flies in their habitats. <#/>Flies caught were blown into a sandfly cage then processed for identification.
\par <h> <#/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Processing the sandflies for mounting}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  </h>
\par <#/>Sandflies were processed in the conventional way. <#/>They were thoroughly washed in 10% det
ergent saline to remove castor oil and excess hair using a fine camel hair brush (No.2). <#/>The sandflies were then rinsed in physiological saline and preserved in 70% alcohol in well-labelled specimen tubes. <#/>The mounting procedure used was that of L
ewis (1973).

occurred only in caves and rock crevices, while the unidentified species although predominantly in the ventilation shafts of termite mounds was found resting in animal burrows and dugouts.
\par <#/>The sandflies also varied in
 numbers and species composition over the 6 month period, showing seasonal variation. <#/>This could be attributed to varying weather conditions prevailing during a particular month, such as temperature, rainfall and relative humidity from one locality to
 another (Figs 1a, b, c; 2a, b, c; 3a, b, c).
\par <#/>The most interesting result during the six month survey was the observation of a previously unidentified }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Sergentomyia s p., }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 caught in the Roysambu site in February and March 1990 (Fig.4). <#/>This unidentifi
ed species also constituted the greatest number of sandflies caught in the three study sites, Roysambu being the site showing the greatest variation in species composition (Table 1). <#/>Only males of this species were caught. <#/>Although these sandflies
 were found to belong to the sub-genus }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Neophlebotomus }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 of the genus }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Sergentomyia, }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
they were found to possess five spines on the style instead of the usual four that occur in this genus. <#/>The male terminalia of this species on the style differed from known
 male terminalia of this genus in the arrangement of the spines on the style, shape of the penis sheath, paramere and aedeagus shape. <#/>In addition, the cibarial armature and shape of teeth were found to be distinctly different from any of the known spe
cies.

found in Nairobi, have also been reported in the Central Rift 
Valley and Baringo District leishmaniasis foci, but have not been observed to bite man. <#/>The above observations suggest that none of the phlebotomine sandflies in the Nairobi area are likely to be potential vectors of visceral and cutaneous leishmanias
is. 
\par <#/>The undescribed species which was found to be the most abundant has also been encountered in Machakos District }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Mutinga M. J. pers. commun.) }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
and is under study. <#/>Since only males were caught and they do not require bloodmeals, they do not pose a
ny health hazard to humans. <#/>However, greater efforts need to be made in locating the habitat of the female undescribed species in order to rule out its vector potential.
\par <#/>The results of this study indicate that termite mounds constitute an important
 breeding site for sandflies followed by animal burrows in the Nairobi Area. <#/>Similar findings on breeding sites of sandflies have been reported by Heisch et al. (1956) and Minter (1964). <#/>The observation on seasonal variation in the number of sandf
lies occurring during the 6-month study period are similar to those reported by Basimike (1988), who reported }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 P}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 . }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 rodhaini, S. bedfordi, S. adleri }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 and }{

\f0\fs24\lang2057 to be a "non seasonal" sandfly.
\par <#/>This survey clearly confirms the presence of several species of sandflies in Nairobi, some of which could be a biting nuisance to humans, including an undescribed species. 
\par <#/>Efforts are now being concentrated in locating the microhabitat of females of the species. <#/>Identification of the males caught is being carried out with assistance from the British Museum.
