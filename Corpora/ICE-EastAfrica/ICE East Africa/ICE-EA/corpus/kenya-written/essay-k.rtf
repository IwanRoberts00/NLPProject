\par }{\fs24 <h> <#/> LINGUA FRANCAS.</h>
\par 
\par <#/>Afric
a is populated with a lot of people that speak different/divergent languages. <#/>Starting from the family languages: Nilotes, Bantu, Kushites which are broken further into smaller language groups. <#/>However all these people they communicate somehow wit
h a language that is understandable among them. <#/>Such a language is called a lingua franca. <#/>Fromkin V and Rodman R, (1988) p 271 propose too that lingua Franca <quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24 
".. is any language which is used by people with divergent languages."}{\fs24 </X><quote/> Therefore English, Swahili are lingua francas in Kenya since many people with different languages can speak them.
\par 
\par <#/>They continue to give us an example of how a lingua franca can occur apart from learning this in school. <#/>They say
\par "In medieval times a trade language came into use in the Mediterranean ports. <#/>It consisted of Italian mixed with <-_french><+_French>, Spanish, Greek and Arabic, and it was called lingua franca, "Frankish language" (Op cit)
\par 
\par <#/>Thus pidgins can also be a lingua fra
nca so long as people are using it widely and of different languages. <#/>Africa and especially East and West Africa there was a lot of trade going on such that people from other areas had to use a Common language to understand one another in business dea
ls. <#/>That is why some lingua francas are called "trade languages". <#/>For example in East Africa Swahili is used as a lingua franca in almost all market places while in West Africa Hausa is the lingua Franca.
\par 
\par <#/>As I said before lingua francas arise w
hen there is a need of communication between/among groups with different languages. <#/>English speaking Africans were scarce when Asian came to Kenya. <#/>Asians thus had no choice as to learn English: Swahili was added by all in order to communicate wit
h African servants in all places and it became a medium of communication. <#/>A lingua franca doesn't mean one who speaks knows each and every rule of it but brings out the aspect of being understood. <#/>For example:
\par 
\par The Asian Swahili: <ea/>}{\b\v\fs24 <&/>Swahili text}{\fs24 
\par 
\par Standard Swahili:<ea/>}{\b\v\fs24 <&/>Swahili text}{\fs24 
\par 
\par <#/>Thus in conclusion a habitual language used at a place is a lingua franca. <#/>In South Africa for example the lingua francas there are Fanagalo, Nyanja, Twsana and Towubemba; In West Africa: Yaunde and Duala
; in Central Sudan and North Africa there is Zande and in East Africa there are Swahili, Ganda (in Uganda), Amharic (in Ethiopia) and English.
\par 
\par <#/>I could thus also agree with Bailey R.W and Robinson J.L (1973) p. 73 as <quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24 "... any tongue serving as a means of communication among groups that have no other language in common ..."}{\fs24 </X><quote/>
\par 
\par <#/>It can even be English in the <-_Phillipaes><+_Philippines> and India, or Swahili in Kenya, English in Uganda and Kenya or the Zande in North Africa.
\par 
\par 
\par <h> <#/> PIDGIN AND CREOLES.</h>
\par <#/>"... missionaries and traders from one part of the world have visited and attempted to communicate with peoples residing in another area. <#/>In such cases the contacts is too specialised and the cultures too widely separ
ated for the usual lingua franca to arise. <#/>Instead the two (or possibly more) groups use their native languages as a basis for a rudimentary language of few lexical items and "straight forward" grammatical rules. <#/>Such a "marginal language" is call
ed a pidgin". <#/>The above quote is from Fromkin V and Rodman R, (1988), p. 272.
\par 
\par <#/>Let us take some cultures therefore like the French in contact with Africa or English and Africa have formed such that some words are borrowed from other languages thus s
implifying a language. <#/>A language that arises from this process is new and is called a pidgin. <#/>One such language, pidgin is Tok Pisin (Used in Papua New Guinea) This like other pidgins the lexical items <-_relie><+_rely> mostly on English.
\par 
\par <#/>There is some grammar in pidgins though not thorough rudimentary. <#/>Like any language it has phonological system that is governed by rules. <#/>Fromkin V and Rodman R, (1988), p. 272. gives an example of Tok Pisin "}{\b\fs24  [C] ,[\'8a] and [S], }{
\fs24 are all possible <-_pronounciations><pronunciations> of the phoneme /S/ }{\b\fs24 [masien], [masien] and [macien]}{\fs24  all mean the "machine".
\par 
\par <#/>This shows us that pidgin language is actually simplified. <#/>With their small vocabulary (-ies) however, pidgins are not good at expressing fine
 distinctions of meaning. <#/>Case, tense, mode, voice are generally absent from pidgins. <#/>Though the set of language is always simpler in pidgins. <#/>In Cameroon (cp) pidgin, the pronoun system does not show gender or all the case differs that exist 
in standard English.
\par }{\b\v\fs24 
\par <&/>table
\par }{\fs24 
\par <#/>The characteristics of one pidgin differs from one pidgin to the other depending on the native language of the pidgin speaker.
\par 
\par <#/>Robert A Hall gives the <-_distinctinction><+_distinction> between Pidgin and lingua franca p. 91
\par <#/>'Any tongue serving as a means of communication is a lingua franca but a pidgin is a lingua franca that in the course of its adoption has become simplified and restructured used.' (Pidgin).
\par <#/>
\par Robert A Hall, in Bailey's R.W, 1973. p.91 says this about the development of pidgin. <#/>He says that the second side of pidgin language is Creole.
\par 
\par <#/><quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24 "Eventually this simplified language extends beyond the functions of trade or exploration that first gave rise to it and becomes the native language of some members of the community. }{\fs24 <#/>}{\v\fs24 
Once the language reaches this second stage it is considered as a Creole and before long the process of relexification begins to take place as the structure of the simplified language is expanded by the introduction of new Vocabulary. }{\fs24 <#/>}{
\v\fs24 At this point in its development, a Creole may be extended to all members of the community and this begins the historical patterns of growth through borrowing and internal change characteristics of all human language."}{\fs24 </X><quote/>
\par 
\par <#/>This tells us that a Creole is found after a pidgin. <#/>A pidgin adds new words, complex in vocabulary than pidgin. <#/>A Creole can be a language on its own and <-/infact> different Creoles are formed depending on the number of pidgins. <#/>
Thus when a pidgin actually has people to speak it as a language it's a Creole. <#/>This can happen if pidgin speakers are put together away from their mother tongues. <#/>This was the case during slavery so that the slave masters wanted to make sure they
 didn't plot against them. <#/>And when they needed to communicate therefore they had to use pidgin. <#/>Again the gave birth to children who learnt and acquired that pidgin and thus a Creole. <#/>This is the case with West Africa during slave trade.

\par 
\par <#/>T
he Creole Speakers sometimes favour their nationality. <#/>For example in Sierra Leon they don't borrow most of English words because of national solidarity while others refuse or can't even remember their mother tongue for example Haiti use only <-_frenc
h><+_French> in outside contacts.
\par 
\par <#/>Pidgin language is short lived. <#/><quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24 "Certain amount of well meant disapproval"}{\fs24 </X><quote/> (Op Cit p. 92) explains that pidgin is increasing its words.
\par 
\par <#/>Thus I can sum up by saying that a pidgin is a <quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24 "... lingua franca and that in its course it's become simplified and restructured... }{\fs24 <#/>}{\v\fs24 
The reduced language which results from this process is nobody's native language but the languages of its speakers considerably influence its vocabulary and other features"}{\fs24 </X><quote/> (op Cit p.93)
\par 
\par <#/>The users may stop using native and use pidgin solely and then when they intermarry and children grow up knowing pidgin as mother tongue, this becomes a Creole. <#/>The vocabulary must expand to accommodate it
's users' everyday needs. <#/>Example of Creole is Africaan (S. Africa).
\par 
\par <#/>Pidgin's spellings are based on phonemes. <#/>For example Melanesian pidgin, the English Sentence meaning 'I have books' is "mi get trifela buk" and not "me got three three fellow book" (op. cit 95)
\par 
\par <#/>Pidgin lack familiar features of well European grammar like tenses, cases and numbers but got other features to make up for them.
\par 
\par <#/>In languages with W. Africa elements, prefixes replace suffixes as indicators of grammatical re
lationships. <#/>Haitian Creole for instance has no verb tense in our sense. <#/>Instead verbs are distinguished by a set of prefixes indicating the continuity or completion of the action performed; while "mwech\'e2te" means 'I sing', "mw\'ea ap-ch\'e2
te" means "I am singing" and mw\'ea "f\'e9 k-chat\'ea" (op cit 97).
\par 
\par <#/>If a language has been simplified thus reconstructed that's a pidgin, but if the pidgin is acquired as a mother tongue then that's a Creole. <#/>This has happened in Africa because of the large diversity in languages.
\par 
\par <#/>Creoles often crossed in slave trade plantations in areas in Africa like Krio in Sierra Leon developed from an English based pidgin.
\par 
\par 
\par <h> <#/> DIALECTS.</h>
\par <#/>Africa has a diversity of languages; in them there are sub-languages. <#/>On
e language can have some sub-groups for example Luhya has some divisions like Maragoli, Bukuou and Isukha. <#/>The three are able to understand on another in some Kind of way though the language doesn't tally one word by another. <#/>These is a form of di
alects. <#/>These three don't have to be in Kenya, Bukusu's from Uganda and Kenya are the same thus the geographical site of the dialects can vary.
\par 
\par <#/>Fishman J.A in his book of '}{\fs24\ul Sociolinguistics}{\fs24 ' says that <quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24 'dialects are Variations of language
 on some dimension other than time of most <-_consern><+_concern> is geographic space or distance' .... 'there are other Kinds of distance' p. 21-26. }{\fs24 <#/>}{\v\fs24 
'They can be Phonological. Lexical and grammatical Uniformity may obtain over large geographic expenses when settlement is simultaneous and when verbal interaction as well as a common identification is different'}{\fs24 </X><quote/>}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 
(op cit.)
\par 
\par <#/>He implies that these dialects originated as in the groups originated from one Common place. <#/>Like Bantus, down the
 group are Luhyas who separated to different places that then language started to change. <#/>There is a variation in phonology, vocabulary and actual <-_intelligiability><+_intelligibility> (understanding). <#/>The further removed the more you don't unde
rstand one another.
\par 
\par <#/>Fromkin V and Rodman R, 1988, p. 253 say <quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24 "The dialects of a single language may thus be defined as mutually intelligible forms of a language that differ in systematic ways from each other"}{\fs24 </X_><quote/>.
\par 
\par <#/>When the dialects are mutually intelligible forms then the speaker can't understand one another.
\par 
\par <#/>A language associated with a particular social groups like the upper class then it becomes a social dialect. <#/>These is usually associated with a particular accent.
\par 
\par <#/>Fromkin V and Rodman R, 1988, p. 254 says <quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24 
"Within a single group of speakers who are in regular contact with each other, the changes are spread among the group and 'learned' by their children. <#/>When some social barrier separates groups
 of speakers ... linguistic changes are not easily spread and dialectal differences are reinforced."}{\fs24  </X><quote/> This is an example of how social dialect spreads.
\par 
\par <#/>Different classes of people have a particular way of talking, socializing. <#/>Speakers of sociolect belong to same economic group or similar educational background. <#/>This can be of high status or low. <#/>This can be termed as Varieties.
\par 
\par <#/>Every individual speaks with his/her style. <#/>There is variation in the presentation of speech and this is known as idiolect. <#/>Fromkin V and Rochan R, 1988, p. 253 says: <quote_><X_> }{\v\fs24 
'The Unique characteristics of the language of an individual speaker are <-_refered><+_referred> to as the speaker's 'Idiolect'}{\fs24 </X><quote/>.
\par 
\par 
\par <h> <#/> REGISTER.</h>
\par People have a particular speech or language in certain situations. <#/>For example when in court, someone talks differently as one who is in church. <#/>The way they utilize the rules of English or any language in that particular context. <#/>They are di
fferent Varieties and this is what we call registers; depending on the context. <#/>It happens to people with the same occupation for example Doctors, lawyers; these people have legal registers.
\par 
\par <#/>A register distinguishes itself from other registers by 
having a number of distinctive by having a number of distinctive words or using certain phrases in a particular way. <#/>The vocabulary is very distinctive. <#/>An example of religious register is as follows:
\par 
\par <quote_><X_> }{\v\fs24 O God the king of Glory
\par Who hast exalted thine only son
\par Jesus Christ with great triumph
\par Unto they Kingdom in heaven ...
\par Beseech thee leave us not comfortless
\par but send to Us, thine holy ghost...}{\fs24 </X><quote/>
\par 
\par <#/>There is in this register the use a of number of theological terms: Glory be to, has exalted thine, leave us not comfortless - ... <#/>' This formula of religious language is usually seen in the ending too when they say <quote_><X_> }{\v\fs24 
"Who liveth and reigneth with thee and the holy ghost, One God, world, without end, Amen"}{\fs24 </X><quote/>.
\par <#/>This is from Crystals D and Dary D, '}{\fs24\ul Investigating English Style'}{\fs24  p. 95-193.
\par 
\par <#/>Another example of a register of broadcast talks and news has rigid conditions on the user. <#/>The writer has to ensure that his material can be easily jointed and mus
t avoid anything which would disturb entire fluency such as <-_ambigous><+_ambiguous> structures that could read us (I'm sorry I'll read that again), tongue twisting etc. <#/>He must make sure that his material can be understood and the listener cannot as
k for a repeat.
\par 
\par <#/>In newspaper reports there is the need for Compression of Information to limited space and also there is need for clarity and avoidance of ambiguity. <#/>No wonder a headline should contain clear, succinct and intriguing message to spec
kle interest in the reader.

\par <#/>With reference to the language situation in Africa discuss the following:
\par 1. Lingua franca
\par 2. Pidgin and creoles
\par 3. Dialects
\par 4. Register}{\fs24 </X>
\par 
\par <h> <#/> 1. Lingua Franca </h>
\par 
\par <#/>A lingua franca is a common language which is habitually used as a medium of communication between groups and people whose mother tongues are different. <#/>One language comes to be adapted as the medium of some activity or
 activities which the different language communities perform in common. <#/>It may be a common language for commerce, learning, administration, religion or any or all of a variety of purposes: the use determines which determines which members of each lang
u
age community are the ones who learn it. <#/>Languages such as English or Russian, which are widely learnt as second languages in the world today are a type of lingua franca. <#/>They are a special case only in the sense that they are being learnt by <-/u
n
precedentedly> large numbers of people and for a very wide range of purposes. <#/>There can be the emergence of one dialect as a lingua Franca. <#/>William J. Samarin in an article 'Lingua Francas of the world' found in a book by J. Fishman, 'Reading in t
he sociology of language' defines a lingua franca as <quote_><X_> }{\v\fs24 "a language which is used habitually by people whose mother tongues are different in order to facilitate communication between them."}{\fs24 </X><quote/>
\par <#/>An additional requirement included in some <-/defination> is that a lingua franca be a pidgin language (a so called "hybrid" or " mixed" language), but it is not true that all lingua francas are pidgins.
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<#/>A second requirement sometimes found is that a lingua franca be used for commercial purpo
ses but this is again not true of lingua francas, though they frequently arise in a commercial environment. <#/>Other terms compete with lingua Franca as designations for the kind of language being discussed.
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang2057 {<#/>}{\fs24\ul Trade languages}{\fs24  is usually used for some la
nguages not included among the world's majority languages and which is used by some people as a second language in commercial situations. <#/>All trade languages are therefore lingua francas e.g. Kituba and Hausa in Africa.
\par <#/>}{\fs24\ul Contact languages}{\fs24  is a lingua franca whose use is not necessarily habitual. <#/>It is the most neutral of the terms.
\par <#/>International (or universal) language is a lingua franca whose use is actually or virtually international. <#/>Some writers however make the error of using it of lingua francas indiscriminately, even of those with restricted use e. g. English, French.

\par <#/>}{\fs24\ul Auxiliary language}{\fs24  is generally meant to describe an artificially devised lingua franca e.g. Esperanto.
\par <#/>Since a lingua franca is simply a language used to communicate across linguistic barriers, it can itself be any kind of a language; natural, pidginized, or planned.
\par <#/>Aramaic is a lingua franca which was used in Palestine, Syria and Egypt. <#/>Arabic served as a lingua franca in some places following the Mus
lim conquests. <#/>Hausa, a Chadic language serves as a trade language in Dahomey, Togo, Ghana, upper Volta, Nigeria and the Cameroons. <#/>In Africa several languages belonging to the Niger-Congo family have served or are now serving as lingua francas, s
uch as Banbara and Fulani in the west and Ngbandi in northern Congo. <#/>Swahili and Lingala are also included here.
\par <#/>Should there ever be an international lingua franca, one thing is almost certain: like all lingua francas before it, it will pass through a stage of pidginization.
\par 
\par <h> <#/> 2. Dialects.</h>
\par 
\par <#/>According to Joshua Fishman in his book 'Reading in the sociology of language', <quote_><X_> }{\v\fs24 'a dialect is a variety of a language distinguished according to the user'}{\fs24 </X><quote/>: Different group
s of people within the language community speak different dialects. <#/>Dialects tend to differ primarily and always to some extent in substance. <#/>A dialect represents the total range of patterns used by a person's section of the language community.

\par <#/
>Dialects differ in vocabulary, syntax and phonology. <#/>Dialects may also differ in several ways with respect to rule content. <#/>Joshua Whatmaugh asserts that the distinction between Kindred dialects and Kindred languages is a matter of degree. <#/>Th
e
 test is intelligibility. <#/>When communication is disturbed between speakers we say that we have to do with related dialects. <#/>When it is completely broken, related languages. <#/>Speakers of Standard English and German are mutually incomprehensible 
but speakers of Standard English and a variety of English are known as 'lowland scots' understand one another well although they may encounter <-_dificulties><+_difficulties>.
\par 
\par <#/>Dialects may be classified into:
\par <#/>1. Regional dialects
\par <#/>They are geographical and indicate your region of origin. <#/>They are usually grouped by the community into major dialect areas. <#/>There may be considerable differentiation within each area.
\par <#/>2. Social dialects
\par <#/>There are two types.
\par <#/>Standard English - Formal English e.g. in writing of essays. <#/>Code switching is not allowed.
\par <#/>Received <-_Pronounciation><+_Pronunciation> - it is the standard spoken variety i.e. the Queen's English. <#/>It is associated with the aristocracy.
\par <#/>3. Register dialects
\par <#/>This is the variety according to use i.e. the use that you put to a language, for what it is being used for and not who is using it. <#/>Examples are legal register, sports language etc.
\par 
\par <h> <#/> Registers </h>
\par <#/>According to J. Fishman in his book 'Readings in the sociology of language' <quote_>}{\v\fs24 "a register is the name given to a variety of language distinguished according to use"}{\fs24 
</X><quote/>. <#/>The category of 'register' is needed when we want to account for what people do with their language. <#/>When
 we observe language activity in the various contexts in which it takes place, we find differences in the type of language selected as appropriate to different kinds of situations. <#/>A sports commentary and a church service are linguistically quite dist
i
nct. <#/>Registers differ in form. <#/>Some registers have distinctive features at other levels, such as the voice quality associated with the register of church services. <#/>The crucial criteria of any given register are to be found in its grammar and i
t
s lexis. <#/>Probably lexical features are the most obvious - some lexical items suffice almost by themselves to identify a certain register: 'cleanse' puts us in the language of advertising, 'probe' of newspapers etc. <#/>The clearest signals of a partic
ular register are scientific technical terms, except those that belong to more than one science, like 'morphology' in biology and linguistics.
\par <#/>Purely grammatical distinctions between the different registers are less striking, yet there can be considerab
le variation in grammar also. <#/>Often it's not the lexical items that is specific to one register. <#/>Sometimes, for example in the language of advertising, it is the combination of grammatical and lexical features that is distinctive.
\par <#/>Registers are
 not marginal or special varieties of language. <#/>Between them they cover the total range of our language activity. <#/>It is only by reference to the various situations and situation types in which language is used that we can understand its functionin
g
 and its effectiveness - Language is not realised in the abstract: It is realised in the activity of people in situations, as linguistic events which are manifested in a particular dialect and register. <#/>A great deal of grammatical and lexical material
 
is common to many of the registers of a given Language, and some perhaps to all. <#/>There tends to be more difference between events in different registers than between different events in one register. <#/>It is by their formal properties that registers
 are defined. <#/>Registers can be distinguished according to field of discourse, mode of discourse and style of discourse.
\par <#/>'Field of discourse' refers to what is going on: to the area of operation of the Language activity. <#/>'Mode of discourse' refers to the medium or mode of language activity. <#/>\lquote 
Style of discourse' which refers to the relations among the participants. <#/>Some registers are extremely restricted in purpose.

\par <h> <#/> 4. Creoles and Pidgins.</h>
\par <#/>Heine B in his book 'status and u
se of African lingua francas' says that a creole is a lingua franca which has attained mother tongue status. <#/>Pidginisation is a process where a language is simplified, reducing the irregularities in the language. <#/>For example the past tense of see 
w
ould be seed instead of saw. <#/>This process comes about when people who speak different languages come together. <#/>The need to simplify the language becomes <-_neccesary><+_necessary>. <#/>Most pidgins came about as a result of colonial expansion. <#/
>
Pidgins developed in multi-lingual settings to facilitate inter-group communication. <#/>Pidgins also came about as a result of the slave trade. <#/>Different people from different communities came together. <#/>They had to form a simplified language for 
t
he purpose of communication. <#/>Pidgin English is the most common name given to a lingua franca spoken throughout west Africa from Sierra Leone to the Gabon. <#/>It is a medium of communication for African peoples who have no first language in common, fo
r white men of various ethnic backgrounds and for the west African working man, trader and transient people.
\par <#/>G.A. Schneider in his book 'West/African Pidgin-English' says that pidgin-English is not a mere simplification of English but a separate and des
cribable language. <#/>Its vocabulary is predominantly English-based, but these lexical forms have changed their meaning to fit into the value system and world view of the African people.
\par <#/>Cameroonian pidgin English has a few characteristics. <#/>They d
rop a consonant in word or syllable. <#/>They also insert a vowel sound between certain English consonant clusters making for a different phonetic statement. <#/>Cameroonian speakers of broad pidgin-English simplify the English vowel system by contrasting
 
fewer vowel sounds, eliminating the diphthongs through clippings and shortening of vowel - like glides, dropping unstressed vowels in initial position. <#/>The accentual system - stress and terminal markers -- remains quite similar to that of English for 
E
nglish speakers of pidgin. <#/>Tone, high and low contrasts, however, mark the pidgin-English speakers among the Cameroonian people. <#/>This characteristic of certain coexisting prosodic features does not make for unintelligibility since code-switching c
o
nventions and redundancy help overcome most communication difficulties. <#/>Absent in pidgin-English are the English singular - plural markers and time-markers in verbs. <#/>There are no native speakers of pidgin-English but there is fairly large group th
at uses it constantly.
\par <#/>According to Hymes, D in his book 'Pidginization and Creolization of languages' a pidgin is 'a contact vernacular, normally not the native language of any of its speakers.\rquote 
\par <#/>Creoles
\par <#/>A Creole is a pidgin that has acquired mother tongue status. <#/>It can develop from a pidgin in two ways:
\par 1) <#/>Where speakers of a pidgin are put together and can no longer communicate in their mother tongues. <#/>This happened mainly during the slave trade where the slave masters separated pe
ople who spoke the same mother tongue to avoid them plotting against their masters.
\par <#/>2) Where a pidgin becomes a useful means of communication and they extend it and use it in their homes.
\par <#/>In West Africa creolization was forced because of the slave 
trade. <#/>The differences between a creole and a pidgin are not many. <#/>They arise due to the fact that the creole functions as a mother tongue and therefore has a larger vocabulary. <#/>It would also exhibit or show a greater stylistic range. <#/>It i
s
 also used in more domains. <#/>The creole would be more spoken at a faster rate. <#/>It would be more expressive. <#/>It needs to be more flexible and innovative. <#/>It must express a whole range of human experience. <#/>It has a more elaborate syntacti
c structure as compared to a pidgin.
\par <#/>If a creole was allowed to develop in isolation from the target language, it would also become a distinct language from the standard English. <#/>David Decamp in an article 'Introduction: The study of pidgin and creo
le languages' says that the term creole originally meant a white man of European descent born and raised in a tropical or semi-tropical colony. <#/>Only later was the meaning extended to include indigenous natives and others of non-European origin e.g. Af
r
ican slaves. <#/>Most creoles are European based, i.e. each has derived most of its vocabulary from one or more <-_european><+_European> languages. <#/>Creole French and creole English are the most frequent in west Africa and the free world, but Spanish, 
Dutch and Portuguese are common in other parts of the world. <#/>A creole is inferior to its corresponding standard language only in social status.
\par <#/>Most west African creoles are said to be free variant. <#/>They also get rid of redundancies, extra work 
and make it simple. <#/>Numerically the largest are the French-based creoles. <#/>English creoles are used in West Africa, in the Cameroons and in Sierra Leone. <#/>According to Robert Hall in his book 'Pidgin and Creole languages' Creoles began as a sort
 
of baby-talk used by masters, plantation owners and merchants to communicate with their servants, slaves and customers. <#/>Each speaker deliberately mutilated the standard language by eliminating all grammatical inflections, reducing the number of phonol
ogical and syntactic contrasts, and limiting the vocabulary to a few hundred words.

\par 
\par <#/>Africa is made up of diverse number of languages. <#/>These languages can also be divided up to language families depending on their origins. <#/>We have four major language families in Africa.
\par <#/>(i) Niger-Kordofonian, is in central and Eastern Africa.
\par <#/>(ii) Nilo-Saharan, most of them being found in E. Africa.
\par <#/>(iii) Afro-Asiatic, this is mainly spoken at the Northern parts of Africa.
\par <#/>(iv) Khoisan, this group is found in Southern Africa characterised by 'click' sounds.
\par <#/>The classification of these languages was done basically on phonological <-_resemblances><+_resemblance>.
\par 
\par <h> <#/> (a) LINGUA FRANCAS.</h>
\par 
\par <#/>A lingua Franca is understood as a common language used as a medium of communication between groups of people with different mother tongues.
\par 
\par <#/>For a language to b
ecome a lingua Franca there must be reasons for the need to use it by the groups involved. <#/>There are three main reasons why people develop Lingua francas. <#/>The language used as a Lingua franca can be even one of the mother tongues which has strong 
impact on others.
\par 
\par <#/>The main reasons why Lingua Francas developed was due to:
\par 
\par - <#/>Trade; people needed a language they could use in trade with their neighbours. <#/>There was no way they could interact with each other without a common language between them to facilitate trade.
\par 
\par - <#/>Communication; When different communities live in a given environment they are bound to meet their neighbours who use a different mother tongue. <#/>So there rose a need for an intermediate language which could be understo
od by the involved groups to facilitate communication between them.
\par 
\par - <#/>Administration; During the colonial period the colonialists introduced and imposed certain languages on the colonised so as to ease their administrative work over the colonised. <#/
>This also applied to African leaders. <#/>For example the Ganda dominated the Basoga and Toro forcing them also to start using Ganda as their administrative language. <#/>Thus Ganda language developed into a Lingua franca.
\par 
\par <#/>A lingua franca as a rule has its origin in a natural language, which is learned by people speaking other languages as their mother tongues, and is habitually used by them as their second language.
\par 
\par <#/>A lingua franca can be differentiated from the mother tongue by the fact of its 
having to undergo a process defined as simplification or pidginization. <#/>The spread of African Lingua francas differs considerably according to age, sex and vocation of the speakers of that particular lingua franca and it also fluctuates from one langu
age to the other. <#/>Use of lingua francas among the older people and children declines, it is predominantly the language of the working youth.
\par 
\par <#/>The spread of lingua francas can highly be attributed to schools because lingua francas have become learnin
g languages in schools. <#/>Thus, the male population are the ones more exposed to lingua francas than women because most of the school attendants are males and also males have greater mobility in comparison to women thus they have more inter-ethnic conta
cts.
\par 
\par <#/>The spread of lingua francas usually takes root among the languages which are closely related to it more than among other languages. <#/>For example Swahili spread more particularly among the Bantu domains.
\par 
\par <h> <#/> }{\fs24\ul AFRICAN LINGUA FRANCAS.</h>
\par }{\fs24 
\par <#/>We have a considerable number of lingua francas spoken in Africa and grouped according to where they are used or their situation.
\par 
\par <#/>(a) South Africa:
\par <#/>In this region we have seven distinct lingua francas being used.
\par 
\par <#/>(i) Fomagalo:-
\par <#/>This is
 a language which was <-_refered><+_referred> to as 'coolie language' or at times 'Indian language'. <#/>This language has been used as kitchen language between Europeans and their African servants. <#/>So if was develop to facilitate the master - servant
 interaction between white masters and their African servants. <#/>It derives its vocabulary from Nguni (Bantu), English and Afrikaans.
\par <#/>It spread into Rhodesia, Zambia and Katanga. <#/>Presently it is being used in the north and east of South Africa, Burbau, East London, Rhodesia, Copperbelt of Zambia and Katanga.
\par 
\par <#/>(ii) Tswana:
\par <#/>This is a Bantu Language and it is the official language of Botswana. <#/>Though it is also one of the lingua francas, it is restricted. <#/>This is because there are other six Bantu languages being spoken in this province.
\par 
\par <#/>(iii) Lozi:
\par <#/>This is also a Bantu language. <#/>It has some other names it is also being <-_refered><+_referred> to as Rozi, Kololo and Sikolo. <#/>It gained ground at the Upper Zambezi as a forc
ed rule on people by Sebitwana. <#/>It was mainly spread by young men from noble families. <#/>It spread to Anglia later on.
\par 
\par <#/>(iv) Umbundu:
\par <#/>This is the language of Ovimbundu inhabiting Benguela highlands South of Angola. <#/>It is a Bantu language. <#/>It also spread along the coast and in the interior along the railway line.
\par 
\par <#/>(v) Lwena:
\par <#/>It is a Bantu language. <#/>It is spoken as a lingua franca in eastern Angola, South-Western Congo and the north-western part of Zambia. <#/>It spread due to movement of labourers. <#/>It is being used now in Zambia as language of education.
\par 
\par <#/>(vi) Town Bemba:
\par <#/>This is a Bantu language group. <#/>It is used in the copperbelt in towns of Ndola, Kitwe, Nkana, Chingola, Mufulira, Luasha and Kabulushi.
\par 
\par <#/>(vii) Nyanja
\par <#/>This is the predominant language in Malawi and it is also a Bantu language. <#/>Presently it is being used in Malawi, eastern Zambia, Mozambique and parts of Rhodesia.
\par <#/>This language is divided into various dialects eg.
\par <#/>- Mang'anja:- found in the South-East.
\par <#/>- Cewa:- found in the west.
\par <#/>- lake Nyanja:- found in the north-east.
\par 
\par <#/>(b) Congo Basin:
\par <#/>In this region we have three lingua francas being used namely;
\par 
\par <#/> (i) Luba: lingua franca.
\par <#/>This compromises of a multi
plicity of Bantu languages. <#/>It should not be mistaken with the Tshihiba language. <#/>This language is divided into dialects e.g. Western, Central, Eastern and Southern dialects. <#/>The western dialect is the most important and is the one being used 
in schools. <#/>It is used in the areas like Auluaburg, Bukwanga, Tshikapa, Lusanbo
\par 
\par <#/> (ii) Kituba.
\par <#/>This language also belongs to the Bantu group. <#/>This language is used in Congo. <#/>It also variable numbers of dialects.
\par 
\par <#/>(iii) Lingala:
\par <#/>T
his is also <-_refered><+_referred> to as the language of the river. <#/>It belongs to the Ngala group of the Bantu. <#/>This language is spoken in the banks of Congo River between Kinshasa and Basoko. <#/>It has many dialects depending on ethnic and soci
al differences.
\par 
\par <#/>(c) Eastern Africa
\par <#/>In this group also we have three lingua francas:
\par 
\par <#/> (i) Swahili:
\par <#/>This language developed at the coast<-_refered><+_referred> to by the Arabs as the coast language. <#/>This language belongs to the group of 
Bantu languages. <#/>The language has a large number of dialects the written language being based on Unguja dialect found in Zanzibar.
\par <#/>In order to develop into a lingua franca this language underwent three stages
\par - The spread along the coast region.
\par <#/>- Its penetration into the interior of the continent.
\par <#/>- Its development since arrival of colonial powers.
\par <#/>This language is basically used in East Africa. <#/>It is believed to have developed due to the intermarrying between the Arabs and Persians
 with African women. <#/>The women learnt some Arabic words and used them when communicating to their Arabic husbands while men also learn some Bantu words which they used when communicating with their Bantu wives. <#/>So the children born to them grew up
 
knowing a few words from Bantu and Arabic languages. <#/>So theirs was a mixture of words. <#/>Kiswahili then developed from the mixture of words from generation to generation creating the language. <#/>The slaves also contributed to the development of Ki
swahli language. <#/>This is because they were from different ethnic communities and now when they came together they needed a language for interaction.
\par 
\par <#/>This language is believed to have been spoken first at Lamu Island. <#/>it developed into a lingua 
franca when the traders started penetrating the interior of the continent. <#/>It attained special importance when it was made the lingua franca of the Zenj empire.
\par 
\par <#/>The spread of Kiswahili into the interior was simple because it was meeting Bantus who had some of their words mixed in the language making it easy for them to learn.
\par 
\par <#/>It became strongly established first among the Nyamwezi because they were traders at that particular period. <#/>Its penetration into the interior was favoured by the epi
demic which hit the Maasai community who had been a stumbling block to the traders who were flying the interior of the continent.
\par 
\par <#/>The descendants of the first Swahili speakers grew up using it as their mother tongue. <#/>Swahili is one of the languages in East Africa with the largest number of dialects. <#/>These dialects are classified according to the place they are used. eg.

\par 
\par <#/>* Killnguja:-
\par <#/>This is the dialect of Kiswahili used in Zanzibar and is also the widely used dialect and the accepted standard dialect for education.
\par 
\par <#/>* Kimrima:-
\par <#/>This is the dialect of the Mrima coast and various areas from Vanga nearly to Kilwa. <#/>It is a combination of German and Swahili.
\par 
\par <#/>* Kimgao:-
\par <#/>This is the dialect used at the Mgao coast from Kilwa Southwards. <#/>Some speakers of this dialect are also found around lake Nyosa. <#/>It also borrows words from its neighbours.
\par 
\par <#/>* Kihadimu and Kitumbatu:-
\par <#/>These are dialects used outside the town of Zanzibar. <#/>Kihadima is used in the east and southern part of the island and it is the same dialect being <-_refered><+_referred> to as Kitumbatu in the north.
\par 
\par <#/>* Kipemba:
\par <#/>This is the dialect used in the Island of Pemba. <#/>It is more related to the original dialect of the Pemba inhabitants because it draws most of the words from the old inhabitants of the island.
\par 
\par <#/>* Kimvita:-
\par <#/>This is the dialect used by the peoples of Mombasa. <#/>It also extends from Malindi in the north to Grasi in the South. <#/>There is a big difference between 
it and Kiunguja than the other dialects. <#/>it has drawn most of ist Bantu words from Kinyika and Kigiriama.
\par 
\par <#/>* Kimrita:-
\par <#/>This is the dialect used by the people of Mombasa. <#/>It also extends from Malindi in the north to Gasi in the south. <#/>Th
ere is a big difference between it and Kiunguja than the other dialects. <#/>It has drawn most of its Bantu words from Kinyika and Kigiriama.
\par 
\par <#/>* Kirumba:-
\par <#/>This is the dialect used by people of Vanga and Wasini Island. <#/>It has close relationship with Kimvita the difference is only on the places the two dialects are being used.
\par 
\par <#/>* Kiamu:-
\par <#/>This is the dialect use at Lamu and at the Island of Amu.
\par 
\par <#/>* Kipate:-
\par <#/>This is the dialect used by people living in the Island of Pate. <#/>Its grammar and change of words is almost similar to that of Kiamu dialect.
\par 
\par <#/>* Kishela:-
\par <#/>This is the dialect used at Shela South of Amu. <#/>This dialect seems to fall as an intermediate between the Amu and Pate dialects, this is mainly because the people who developed it were from Amu and Pate and they jointly formed the town of Shela.

\par 
\par <#/>* Kisin:-
\par <#/>This dialect is used in the town of Sin. <#/>This dialect is used between Plate and Faza. <#/>Their grammar is closely related to the Amu dialect. <#/>It bears strong resemblance to Bajun group.
\par 
\par <#/>* Kitikuu:
\par <#/>This is the dialect used by the people of Rasini and the people of the mainland north of Amu.
\par 
\par <#/>(ii) Ganda:-
\par <#/>This is the predominate language of Uganda. <#/>It also belongs to the Bantu language group. <#/>It developed to a lingua franca mainly due to two reasons:
\par - Buganda Kingdom came under British influence earlier than other parts of Uganda. <#/>So the British choose Ganda as administrators over the other neighbouring territories thus Ganda language became the language of administration.
\par <#/>- Ganda language also was introduced as the language of education in schools so when roads and schools were constructed (they were first constructed in the Buganda Kingdom) many people came to learn
 thus going back to their homes with knowledge in Ganda language. <#/>Religious instructions were also in Ganda language.
\par <#/>Thus in the thirties Kiganda had become the language of the press, radio and administration. <#/>The main reason why Ganda managed
 to become a lingua franca in Uganda was because the Ganda people resisted strongly to the introduction of Swahili in their territory because they feared that it would undermine their language. <#/>So it has taken a stronghold on the Southern part of Ugan
da. <#/>It has very little influence over the northern parts of Uganda.
\par 
\par <X_> }{\v\fs24 <#/>(iii) Amharic:
\par <#/>This language belongs to the Semitic languages forming the Hamito-Semitic. <#/>Its development to a lingua franca is closely tied to Ethiopia. <#/>It is bel
ieved to have developed from GE'EZ language which was being used in Ethiopia as early as the 4th century. <#/>It is the language spoken currently almost all over Ethiopia.
\par 
\par <#/> (D) Central Sudan and North Africa:
\par <#/>In this area we have five lingua francas being used.
\par 
\par <#/> (i) Zande:
\par <#/>It belongs to the Adamawa-Eastern sub-family of Niger-Congo languages. <#/>It was imposed on the conquered by the <-_conquerers><+_conquerors>. <#/>The total speakers of this language is relatively small.
\par 
\par <#/> (ii) Sara:-
\par <#/>It belongs to the group of the 'Bongo-Bagirmi' languages. <#/>It comprises of a number of dialects spoken in South-Western Chad. <#/>It is being threatened by its neighbour lingua francas like the Sango and Turku.
\par 
\par <#/> (iii) Kanun:
\par <#/>It is among 
the Saharan languages. <#/>Its spread was a result of expansion of Kanem-Bornu empire. <#/>So it came to be the language of the upper class. <#/>Though it has of recent started dwindling out due to the Hausa lingua franca. <#/>It is presently spoken at We
st of Lake Chad, Nigeria and Bornu province. 
\par 
\par <#/> (iv) Maba:
\par <#/>It consists of a group of dialects spoken in the eastern part of Chad. <#/>It developed to a lingua franca because the Islamic empire was established where the Maba speakers were inhabiting.
 It developed as the language of administration at Wadai by the 17th century.
\par 
\par <#/> (v) Arabic:
\par <#/>It was introduced into North Africa during the spread of Islam. <#/>So it became the most widespread lingua franca in Africa due to the Islamization of most of the North African states.
\par 
\par <#/> (E) Western Central Africa
\par <#/>This region also has seven lingua francas being used by the inhabitants.
\par 
\par <#/> (i) Bulu:
\par <#/>It belongs to the Bantu language group. <#/>It is spoken in Cameroon, Grabon and Rio Muni. <#/>They have occupied now up to Njem. <#/>It developed to the language of education and religious instruction.
\par 
\par <#/> (ii) Yaunde:
\par <#/>This is a language spoken by inhabitants of the surrounding areas of Yaunde the capital city of Cameroon. <#/>It belongs to th
e A 70 group of the Bantu. <#/>It developed to a lingua franca due to the colonization of the region by Germans and French. <#/>It spread to the Samaga river and Southern Cameroon.
\par 
\par <#/> (iii) Pidgin A 70:
\par <#/>This is a group of Bantu languages spoken in S
outhern Cameroon, Cameroon and Rio Muni. <#/>It originated from this territory and spread out. <#/>It is mostly used also in the town of Buala. <#/>It is mostly used by those who don't have command of <-_french><+_French>. <#/>Differences are noted also a
mong the people speaking it according to sex and age. <#/>Men use it more than women. <#/>It is a language of modern African life because it has vocabulary of modern items.
\par 
\par <#/> (iv) Duala:
\par <#/>It belongs to the north-western branch of Bantu languages. <#/
>The language spread due to trade between the Duala and their neighbours. <#/>They acted as go between the coast and the interior. <#/>The language developed to school and church language, thus making it the first African language of literature in the coa
stal of Cameroon.
\par 
\par 
\par <#/> (v) Bali:
\par <#/>It belongs to the Niger-Congo group of languages. <#/>In the 19th century they moved to Southern Cameroon and during colonization of Cameroon by Germans its position was raised to language for administration, church an
d school language of the Basle mission. <#/>The spread of the pidgin affected its spread reducing its speakers drastically.
\par 
\par <#/> (vi) Adamawa-Ful:
\par <#/>This language is used in West Africa between Senegal and Chad. <#/>It belongs to the Niger-Congo family. <#/>It is presently the most dominant lingua franca in the northern part of Cameroon. <#/>It is also divided up in a number of dialects.
\par <#/>- East ful: - spoken in northern Cameroon at Diamare.
\par <#/>- West ful: - the dialect of the Ngaoundere.
\par <#/>- Kambarure: - a pidgin form of Adamawa Ful.
\par 
\par <#/> (vii) Sango:
\par <#/>It is derived from the dialect of Sango spoken at the Ubangi River. <#/>It established itself even before French came the language spread further because its speakers were recruited into the army
 thus spreading the language. <#/>It also has many different dialects differentiated by age and denominations. eg. Protestants use Bossangoa dialect while Catholics use Ubaiki dialect.
\par 
\par 
\par <#/> (f) West African Coast:
\par <#/>This group is also made up of Seven lingua francas.
\par 
\par <#/> (i) Yoruba:
\par <#/>It is one of the Niger-Congo languages. <#/>It is one of the most important African lingua francas because it is spoken by many people. <#/>It has twenty different dialects but the standard from dialect which is used i
n school administration and literature is Oya dialect. <#/>It is spoken in Nigeria, Dahomey and Togoland.
\par 
\par <#/> (ii) Ewe:
\par <#/>It is among the Kwa group of the Niger-Congo languages. <#/>It is divided into dialects. <#/>Ang'lo dialect is spoken between the Volta and Togo border.
\par <#/>Watyi is spoken in South-eastern Togo with the exception of the coastal strip.
\par <#/>Mina, spoken along Togo coast and South - Western Bahomey.
\par <#/>Adya is spoken on both sides of Togo-Bahomey border.
\par <#/>Gu is spoken in South-eastern Bahomey.
\par 
\par <#/> (iii) Twi: (Akan)
\par <#/>This is a dominating language in Ghana. <#/>It belongs to the Kwa group of Niger-Congo family. <#/>Its spread was facilitated by political development in Ghana in the pre-colonial period. <#/>When colonialists came 
they used Twi speakers as administrators thus spreading the language far and wide.
\par 
\par <#/> (iv) Ga:
\par <#/>This language is spoken in South-eastern part of Ghana. <#/>It is also in the Kwa group of the Niger-Congo family. <#/>Germans chose it as a language for schools instruction, literature and also translated Bibles in it.
\par 
\par <#/> (v) Mende and Temne:
\par <#/>They belong to the Mande languages of the Niger-Congo family. <#/>They occupy Sierra Leone and the Atlantic coast. <#/>Mende is spoken in the whole of Southern
 Sierra Leone among Bulon, Banta and Buon language groups. <#/>Temne is spoken as a second language among the Loko, Limba, Bulom and Susu in the north-west part of Sierra Leone. <#/>It belongs to the 'West Atlantic group'.
\par 
\par <#/> (vi) Susu:
\par <#/>It belongs to the Mande group of the Niger-Congo family. <#/>It is the predominant lingua franca of the Western Sudan. it is also used in the western part of Guinea.
\par 
\par <#/> (vii) WoloL:
\par <#/>Belongs to the Niger-Congo family. <#/>It is in the West Atlantic languages. <#
/>Its development into a lingua franca was because its original speakers are very large in number. <#/>They are found in Senegal. <#/>It has been known for long as the language of trade. <#/>It is found in Mauritious, Marocco and Liberia. <#/>It is also s
poken in Senegal and Gambia. <#/>It came to be used in schools in Senegal, administration and also in family communications.
\par 
\par <#/> (h) Western Sudan.
\par <#/>This region consists of eight lingua francas with variable groupings.
\par 
\par <#/> (i) Hausa:
\par <#/>It belongs t
o the group of Chad languages which is a branch of Afro-Asiatic language family. <#/>The languages of this group are spoken around lake Chad. <#/>It became a lingua franca in western Sudan due to trade. <#/>Tripoli owes its origin to spread of Hausa. <#/>
W
hen the British settled in Nigeria they promoted Hausa as the language of communication. <#/>Later on it was standardised and used in radio, press and literature. <#/>It also became the language to be used with English in the parliament in Northern Nigeri
a.
\par 
\par <#/> (ii) Song'ai:
\par <#/>It is the language of the Central Niger River. <#/>Its rise to a lingua franca is associated with the rise of the Songhai empire. <#/>The language family in which it belongs has not yet been established. It is also spoken in centr
al Sahomey and Agades in the east and Hambori..
\par 
\par <#/> (iii) Mosi:
\par <#/>It is one of the languages belonging to the Crur group of the Niger-Congo language family. <#/>It developed to a lingua franca during the time of the Mosi empire. <#/>It is spoken in the Upper Volta and Northern Ghana.
\par 
\par <#/> (iv) Mandingo:
\par <#/>This consists of all dialects spoken in the western Sudan between the Atlantic ocean in the west and the Black Volta in the East. <#/>It is included in the Mande group of the Niger-Congo language fa
mily. <#/>Its development to a lingua franca is highly associated with the west African empire of Mali. <#/>It started by being the official language of the Mali empire. <#/>It has since then been the predominant language of western Sudan.
\par 
\par <#/> (v) Malinke:
\par <#/>This is one of the oldest and purest dialect of Mandingo. <#/>It means the people of Mali. <#/>It is spread between the Atlantic ocean and the Black Volta. <#/>It is divided into dialects. 
\par <#/>- West Malinke is spoken in Gambia and Guinea.
\par <#/>- North Malinke is spoken between eastern Senegal and western Mali.
\par <#/>- South Malinke used at the Upper course of Niger River to South of Bamako, Guinea, Ghana, Mali and Upper Volta.
\par 
\par <#/> (vi) Dyula:
\par <#/>This is found in Western Sudan. <#/>This group was fo
rmed by intermarrying between Mandigo and Senefu, Bobo and Anyi. <#/>The reason their language spread was because they don't like concentrating together. <#/>It is spread out in the Bani and Niger Rivers.
\par 
\par <#/> (vii) Bambara:
\par <#/>They are counted among the Mandingo. <#/>Their lingua franca was carried away from Mali due to trade that it went to an extent of being used in Timbulltu in the east. <#/>It is also used in Senegal, Niger and Mauritania.
\par 
\par <#/> (viii) Kangbe:
\par <#/>It is one of the dialects of the Man
dingo group. <#/>It developed in Western Sudan due to use of Mandingo into a pidgin dialect. <#/>It was cluefuly spread through trade. It is still being used as a trade language in Mandinka speaking areas in Sierra Leone. 
\par 
\par <#/>Lingua francas developed bec
ause people wanted a language to use for trade, administration and also interaction between different ethnic communities. <#/>They either developed from one of the mother tongues which had a strong impact over its neighbours or from a combination of words
 from different language groups to form a "mixture" of a simplified language.
\par 
\par 
\par <h> <#/> (b) Pidgins and Creoles. </h>
\par 
\par <#/>A pidgin is a vernacular spoken by people with different mother tongues, normally not the native language of any of the speakers invo
lved. <#/>It develops due to trade or due to need to communicate to others whom one does not share with the same language. <#/>It always has a limited vocabulary and it is thus simplified to suit the purpose of which it is intended.
\par 
\par <#/>Pidgins first deve
loped due to need to trade between different groups. <#/>So they are limited both lexically and structurally, that is why it is only suitable for specialized and limited communication. <#/>A pidgin is short lived, if it does not go into extinction, it can
 
only survive by evolving into a creole. <#/>Pidgins appear rapidly and disappear quickly as they appeared. <#/>So the durability of a pidgin in a society depends on its role in the society. <#/>For example in Papua New Guinea or in Cameroon we have a pidg
in English.
\par 
\par <&_>Cameroon pidgin English
\par a go --> I go
\par yu go --> you go
\par wi go --> we go
\par dem go --> they go</&>
\par 
\par <#/>But it should be noted that a pidgin is not a dialect of English. <#/>It is just risen from contact between English and a very different lang
uage structurally. <#/>We do have restricted pidgins which result due to marginal contact and extended pidgins are the ones virtually important in a multilingual area and used beyond the original function of its formation.
\par 
\par <#/>A creole develops when a pid
gin becomes the mother tongue of a speech community. <#/>Since a creole has to express all human experience, the lexicon is expanded and it becomes more elaborate than the original pidgin. <#/>Creoles form from pidgins in two ways; first we may have speak
e
rs of a pidgin being put in a position where they can no longer use their mother tongues for communication so children born to them grow up acquiring the pidgin as their first language or mother tongue. <#/>We also have a pidgin becoming very useful as th
e
 community lingua franca to an extent that it becomes a means of communication between parents who share the same mother tongue. <#/>So its use becomes strongly established that it is used everywhere in the community. <#/>So creoles are some peoples first
 language while a pidgin is no-ones first language.
\par 
\par <#/>A creole establishes itself to an extent that it becomes the native language of most of its speakers for example we can take a creole English.
\par 
\par <&_>Creole English
\par di bwai dem --> the boys
\par di trii bwai --> the three boys
\par dem bwai --> those boys</&>
\par 
\par <#/>We can see that \endash "dem" is used to represent plural in the creole English.
\par 
\par <#/>A creole is a pidgin therefore which has its syntax and vocabulary extended to meet all the communicative needs of a society.
\par 
\par 
\par <h> <#/> (c) Dialects. </h>
\par 
\par <#/>A dialect is a subdivision of language that can be associated with a particular group of speakers smaller than a language group. <#/>It is a particular way a particular group of people a particular language distinct fro
m the way other speak the same language. <#/>A dialect does not have a literary tradition on its origin, but it is a characteristic feature of a language relating to its different users. <#/>So it is rather a way or a manner of speaking a particular langu
age. <#/>So one language can have many different dialects.
\par <#/>Dialects also develop for particular reasons and also there are three distinct types of dialects.
\par <#/>- Temporal dialects; they never exist for long they can easily be brought to extinction by< the dynamic nature of human language. <#/>So they are short lived among its users.
\par <#/>- Geographical dialect; these dialects reflect physical space in that most of its speakers use vocabulary of those things found in their environment. <#/>So it is distinguished from other due to the region its speakers come from.
\par <#/>- Social dialect; this is the dialect used by particular people depending on their social classes. <#/>The acquisition of this dialect depends on ones membership to a class. <#/>Membership is also determined by certain factors. <#/>These factors are;

\par <#/>- Birth - one grows up to use the dialect which is used by those he lives with in his place of birth or society. <#/>For example in Luhya we have many dialects, so when one is born among the Samia group he will grow up using the Samia dialect.
\par <#/>- Sex - you find individuals of the same sex using a particular dialect or speak in a way which is different from the way other members of the opposite sex speak. <#/>They also tend to coin their voca
bulary depending on things which are common among them but not found in the members of the opposite sex.
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {\v <#/>- Education - you find those individuals with high educational levels or standards speaking in a particular dialect which makes them distinct from 
those who do not have educational achievements. <#/>The social membership can either acquired or it may be achieved.
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang2057 {\v\fs24 
\par <#/>Some examples of dialects are;
\par - Wanga - Samia
\par - Isukha - Abachoni
\par - Idakho - Abamarama
\par - Tiriki - Abamarachi
\par 
\par <#/>Though these are different dialects, they all belong to one language group. <#/>So a language can have many dialects. So dialects are sub-units of a language group.
\par 
\par <#/>Dialects also differ due to the occasion due to the need of the need of the speakers or its actors to distinguish that particular occasion from other occasions. <#/>For example in church priest change their dialect to that ancient Greeks e.g. 
\par <#/>Thou name be blessed God,
\par Thy kingdom come, etc.
\par 
\par <#/>Dialects also change depending on where it is spoken, for e
xample the way a person speaks the Unguja dialect of Kiswahili will be different from the way somebody in western Kenya can speak the same dialect. <#/>This difference is due to dialect continuum. <#/>When one moves away from a point to the furthest point
 the way people speak changes. <#/>Those who stay close to each other are more mutually intelligible than those who live far apart though they speak the same language.
\par 
\par <#/>Age is also another big influence on dialect. <#/>The way youth speak is different f
rom the way the older people speak the same language. <#/>Though dialects can be very different from each other in the same language. <#/>There is always a standardised dialect of that language which is used in its literature like is the case of Unguja di
alect in Kiswahili language.
\par 
\par <#/>So the dialect depends on its speakers because it derives its vocabulary from the environment of its speakers.
\par 
\par 
\par <h> <#/> (d) Register: </h>
\par 
\par <#/>This is the variety distinguished from other languages or dialects according 
to its use of functions. <#/>So the variety of language and vocabulary used is selected according to its field of profession of type of situation. <#/>For example language of commentaries are linguistically distinct from each other.
\par 
\par <#/>So its vocabulary 
is restricted to its field of coverage. <#/>For example in the language used in the church voice quality also matters because one has to present the message in the humblest way possible. <#/>The clear <-_distincting><+_distinguishing> part of the register
 are scientific technical terms which have been designed for particular objects of use in the language setting.
\par 
\par <#/>For example if we take the case of a medical register we find the vocabulary commonly used
\par - anaesthesia
\par - convulsion
\par - stethoscope.
\par - antibiotics.
\par - antihistamines.
\par - bandages.
\par - hypodermic syringes.
\par - paediatric care.
\par - BP machines. etc.
\par 
\par <#/>All these terms and many more are used in the medical register and they have specific meanings. <#/>They mean objects used for different activities in 
the medical field. <#/>If you go and tell a teacher about these terms, he will seem to be out of place because he is familiar with words likes
\par - teaching
\par - chalk
\par - blackboard
\par - marking of exams
\par - cluster
\par - marking scheme.
\par 
\par <#/>The language and vocabulary used refers to what is going on in the area of operation of the language performance}{\fs24 . </X></I>}{\v\fs24

\par <#/>Humour is that quality of action

\par <#/>}{\fs24 The character, Waweru, is flabbergasted by the hardness of Hungarian bread. <#/>Whereas to Erika this seems not a problem, to Waweru it is a so
urce of disgust. <#/>What more with waking up hungry and dying to dig your teeth into some soft, fleshy bit of bread when voil\'e0
! at the touch of it your appetite almost fails you. <#/>In this situation he finds himself questioning Erika's rationale - that 
one needs only cover it in nylon and it will stay soft and fresh. <#/>But is that what Waweru gets? <#/> To this effect he finds it more appropriate or easier to use an electric saw to cut, although he does not actually do it - it is merely his view vis-
\'e0-vis keeping the loaf covered. <#/>Mak'Oloo has employed a hyberbole to emphasise the "hardness" of the bread.
\par 
\par <#/>Waweru admits that he is tired with what he calls the tendency of the average Hungarian, the not - so - well - travelled citizen, who to beli
eve that all Africans are Nigerians! <#/> Just after a nasty encounter with some Hungarian youth, aboard some lorry, he is confronted by a Hungarian woman whose attention has been drawn by the shouting. <#/>The Hungarians, burning with racism, have called
 
him names and Waweru has not spared them either, paying tit for tat in some good Hungarian. <#/>Her first reaction is that Waweru is Nigerian. <#/>The humour behind this statement to one who knows that Africa is made up of a great many number of countries
 is the ignorance so exposed.
\par 
\par <#/>Waweru is not afraid of sparring with Csaba. <#/>Or so it seems. <#/>However, he confesses to the reader that he is afraid of him because of his physical fitness and his stamina in the boxing ring. <#/>Before his "match" w
ith Csaba he withdraws to the reader to tell him that even though the others cannot notice his fright of what is to befall him he is AFRAID!:

\par 
\par <#/>When the garlic-smelling man informs Waweru of the Arabs' disturbing his girlfriend, Erika, Waw
eru takes a long time to return back to the restaurant, at least in a hurry, ostensibly because to him Hungarians have a habit of suddenly turning friendly once drunk. <#/>That they would not notice one even if he stepped on their toes when they are sober
. <#/>But once they have gulped a litre or so of P\'c1
LINKA or TOKAI they "realise" that you are their comrade and it is then that they want to know the latest news from Africa. <#/>Coincidentally, the revelation of this prejudice comes to drive one gradually 
to the climax - the ultimate, the fight with the racist Arabs.
\par 
\par <#/>The interaction between the sexes does not seem to favour the African male students. <#/>There is a permanent shortage of African girls because the men outnumber them by far. <#/>Waweru gr
aphically describes the imbalance which he summarises in his statement that before the start of an academic year the usual question that is asked is how many "relief supplies" will be imported from motherland Africa.
\par 
\par <#/>At Szechenyi furd\'f6, the beautiful 
open air public bath, Waweru meets Erika, Kovacs and his girlfriend Zsuzsa. <#/>He admits, or more appropriately, confesses to the reader that the whites are surprised to see a black person, him. <#/>Albeit they are at first amazed they soon realise that 
he is a human being - he does not have a tail and he has five toes on each foot.
\par 
\par <#/>At the meeting of the African students at the common room adjacent to Mustafa's on the tenth floor of the hostel in Zugl\'f3 people are disordered. <#/>We are told that all t
he Accra market women combined cannot make so much hullaballoo. <#/>Everybody is talking - laughing, joking, arguing or calling one another. <#/>Now Mustafa is the President of the students association. <#/>But despite this his attempts to bring order int
o
 the meeting is initially frustrated by his colleagues who keep on shouting. <#/>What is more, there is this young girl who keeps on calling on him to pay her back some 500 Forint. <#/>She tells Mustafa to climb down from the table and come to her. <#/>Sh
e
 says she needs the money for her visa for her London trip. <#/>Mustafa in his attempt to bring some order amongst the gathering loses his temper at the arrogance displayed by his colleagues. <#/>Jumping up and down the table he breaks the top board and e
n
ds up on the ground. <#/>Martha offers him some liniment. <#/>Mustafa is perhaps attracted to her and says sheepishly that although his shin feels okay the pain might persist later "perhaps after the meeting" and so she should apply some more liniment aft
er the meeting! <#/> To Maria, the girl who is pestering him for her money, Mustafa tells her that since she lent him the money while he was between her legs she might as well wait for him to go back there to pay her back!
\par 
\par <#/>Interestingly, the critic of 
the novel is tempted to deduce that the use of humour by Mustafa reveals his character. <#/>He is romantic in the way he talks to Martha although with an overtone of seduction. <#/>He is perhaps involved in sexual escapades as what he tells Maria seems to
 have embarrassed her before her colleagues.
\par 
\par <#/>Waweru's humour does not always have good endings. <#/>For instance when he frightens Zsuzsa in bed Kovacs and Erika are not amused. <#/>He thence ends up feeling ashamed of himself and wakes up before the o
thers, goes and stays in the kitchen until his friends wake up.
\par 
\par <#/>Waweru humorously describes his second sexual escapade with Zsuzsa. <#/>He compares it to an astronaut's experience in space. <#/>That they <quote_><X_> }{\v\fs24 "overtook a Soviet Solyut on its w
ay to circle earth and nearly collided with a capsule I could not immediately identify, badly startling the astronauts working inside."}{\fs24 
</X><quote/> <#/>And, at the end of the intercourse Zsuzsa collapsed panting on his chest, momentarily at a loss of words. <#/>The hyperbole is effectively used in this narration to emphasise the adventurous experience the two go through.
\par 
\par <#/>When Waweru and Abacha go to a discotheque in town one Saturday evening they hope to enjoy themselves to the full. <#/>Unfortunately 
for Abacha this does not seem to be his day because he does not have company. <#/>Leaving Abacha at the bar he walks around and finally spots some "lady" sitting alone. <#/>For him this is his twelfth hour, he celebrates within himself that he has at last
 
found someone with whom to dance. <#/>He vividly describes her - she has shoulder - long hair and rather broad shoulders. <#/>He is so excited that he finds himself striding fast toward her "in case somebody else had ideas about 'her'. <#/>" He gets over 
t
o her and uses his seductive language on her to ask her if she cares for a dance with him. <#/>He even readies a charming smile to help speed things up when she turns round to look at him. <#/>Well, she does not actually turn but whirls. <#/>Waweru's smil
e
 vanishes instantly for this is a situation he had not prepared for. <#/>It is a man with a beard "bushier than Karl Marx's. <#/>Paradoxically, the man takes it that he is a gay, a homosexual. <#/>He snaps that he is not one and in any case that is not a 
gays' club. <#/>The narration of this 'quiproquo' serves to ensure a liveliness in the reader as he follows Waweru's experiences further.
\par 
\par <#/>As the disc-jockey plays a slow music number Waweru makes another mistake. <#/>This time he makes sure, though, th
at it is a lady he is approaching. <#/>She has breasts as big as size 8 boxing gloves, says Waweru. <#/>The description of the lady is humorous though the actual encounter with her is disgusting, lacking in the elementary pathos. <#/>She turns to tell him
 off. <#/>Why? <#/> Because he is an African.
\par 
\par <#/>I have appreciated the use of anecdotes by Waweru to emphasise his argument that Hungarians are amongst the least informed earthlings. <#/>Consider the encounter with Margit some moments after Kati tells of
f Waweru on the grounds of his skin colour. <#/>Whereupon asking Waweru his name and being told, but, of course, he is still withdrawn thinking of his humiliation by the Hungarian and it takes her some nagging to drive off the name from him, she instantan
e
ously (read immediately) concludes that he is Nigerian. <#/>She goes further to tell him that most Nigerian names have the first letter O. <#/>That she has read of some Okonkusc in some novel. <#/>And, finally the humour. <#/>Okonkwo is a lovely name she 
s
ays, so can I call you so? <#/> Waweru interjects by saying that he would not be willing to accept such a name. <#/>In an effort to keep him talking, Margit tells "Okonkwo" that his other name is difficult. <#/>(He has only told her his name is Waweru). <
#/>Now, Waweru, the "Nigerian", has to be either a Ibo, Yoruba or Hausa. <#/>If not, he must belong to the smaller clans. <#/>But if not Nigerian he is Ghanaian.
\par 
\par <#/>That Margit is surprised that she has met a Kenya makes her think of interviewing him. <#/
>For Waweru this is interesting because how does one investigate life, as she puts it. <#/>The strength of the statement is the ridiculing of Margit although at a <-/confessionary> level which she does not share with the reader.
\par 
\par <#/>Gyula Bacsi, the boxin
g trainer, is concerned about the forthcoming tournament. <#/>He hopes to get Waweru fit at least a week before the bout. <#/>So he insists that Waweru puts up at his place. <#/>One of his concerns is Waweru's weight which he hopes to trim drown by puttin
g
 him on a crash diet. <#/>But this is not to be understood by Waweru especially after a tiring early morning workout that has drained of his energy. <#/>Whereas Bacsi and his wife, Marika, help themselves to a basket full of brown bread, scones and other 
breakfast snacks and a steaming pot of coffee, he is served a thin miserable slice of bread - "so thin I could see the bottom of the plate through it.\rdblquote 
\par 
\par <#/>When Waweru phones Margit her mother who picks up the phone thinks he is Chinese! <#/> Even Waweru admits that this revelation by Margit made him laugh.
\par 
\par <#/>Waweru is a mischievious character. <#/>While sleeping outside the gym compound with his boxing colleagues he scoops a handful of snow and shoves it into the open mouth of some lightweight bloke who
se snoring is getting into his nerves for he cannot get himself to sleep like the others. <#/>The young man is aroused instantaneously by the snow in his mouth, spits and coughs. <#/>He looks around to see who has been mischievious enough to do this to hi
m. <#/>Meanwhile the "innocent" Waweru has covered his face and is "deep asleep".
\par 
\par <#/>During the party held to honour Waweru (after recovering from a coma miraculously) everybody in attendance seems livened up. <#/>There is Ochola, the Kenyan fellow, and A
bacha, the Nigerian student, who are in a crossfire. <#/>The argument by Ochola is that Abacha does not have an instrument similar to a Luo <ea/>nyatiti! <X_>}{\v\fs24 
<#/> Abacha is so convinced that he has it that he even forgets to let the party pass before rushing to the hostel to get his "instrument". <#/>
He grabs his coat and pulls it on, all the time swearing he will bring back the instrument to show it to Ochola. <#/>The humour is based on the premise of a small issue exploded unnecessarily to the extent of p
eople forgetting the import of their assembly.
\par 
\par <#/>When Abacha brings Waweru's mother and sister to Erika's apartment Waweru is surprised. <#/>He instantaneously takes the reader into his oblivious past. <#/>A sort of autobiographical account though lacki

He in turn knew that he was being watched and refined his "sugar-pinching techniques". <#/>There was this day when he forget to wipe traces of sugar from his lips and cheeks. <#/>When asked by his mother if he had stolen the sugar he immediately denied.

\par <#/>Humour is the quality of being amusing or comic by introduction of sarcasm or irony in a style that can make the reader laugh or smile whilst reading the book <-/incase> of <-_writen><+_written> literature.
\par <#/>Anybody reading Omondi Mak Oloo's book will agree with me that the plot is w
holly supported by strong pillars of humour. <#/>Humour rages from the first to the very concluding page. <#/>To prove this we see the first page where the child is very inquisitive to why Waweru was black, to why his parents were also black, and lastly w
here he comes from. <#/>This was taking place in the eyes of Waweru and anybody could feel how uneasy Waweru felt especially when he smiled at the small child, and she shrank away.
\par <#/>He was very annoyed when he alighted that he even could not tell whether to be angry with Hungarian weather or the racists. <#/>This confusion brings the humour to the reader.
\par <#/>On page 7, Waweru wakes up in the morning at 9. 30 am. <#/>He tries to phone. <#/>He greets the person on the phone as Good morning but in answer he
 retorts, 'good day you mean' simply because the Hungarian morning ends at 8 am. <#/>Waweru threatens Abacha against his usage of a large voice in the mouthpiece. <#/>Abacha tells Waweru about a lady who has been looking for him. <#/>On Abacha`s mention o
f
 her name, Waweru cautions him of making public the whole issue. <#/>The humour lies in the answer, Abacha tells him that there's no single soul within hundred metres unless he was afraid of the pissing puppy. <#/>A puppy cannot interpret human language s
o Abacha uses this to completely shut down Wawerus argument.
\par <#/>Its a great humour on page 11 when Waweru watches himself through a mirror and considered his own image with qualities of an independent person. <#/>\ldblquote I told the guy in the mirror and winked. <#/>\ldblquote 
Its humour when he tells us the image agreed with him because it had winked back when he did same.
\par <#/>Waweru used words that involve humour on page 12. <#/>He suggests that the Hungarian loaves were very hard that he had requested Erika to purchase an
 electric saw. <#/>That brings to our knowledge the fact that the loaves were indeed hard, but <-_exergerates><+_exaggerates> the fact of buying a saw. <#/>He goes further to tell us of the factory tomatoes as Abacha calls them. <#/>He says that the chees
e smelt good good once he got used to the stink. <#/>Surely who will dare like anything that stinks.
\par <#/>Waweru on page 13 comes back into the telephone play. <#/>There was a great misconception on the telephone when Waweru thought he was talking to Jozsi b
ut instead he was talking to a different person. <#/>When the man could not comprehend the name Waweru, he was abused by Waweru as 'Mother fucker'. <#/>This to exchange of pillar words betweeen Jozsi and the person who had received the phone. <#/>When the
 reader discovers that Waweru was talking to a different person, he will be interested to know what happens and really what follows will amuse the reader.
\par <#/>Waweru on page 15 expecting to meet a lady's voice over the phone meets a <-_mans><+_man's> voice.
 <#/>He however told Gyula Bacsi <-_unconcionsly><+_unconsciously> that he thought she was his girlfriend. <#/>Bacsi had advised Waweru to leave ladies for a while for he would loose stamina and his fighting power deteroriates. . . <#/><quote_>}{<X_>}{"}{
\v But you denied having anything to do with them"}{</X><quote/> To the worse extend now Bacsi tells him to wait until he has informed the boys about the matter.
\par <#/>In Wawerus mind on page 17 he admits Csaba is a terror in the ring. <#/>He suggests that if his <-/upperant> c
onnected then it was goodnight for whoever stopped it. <#/>He goes further to say that he was scared stiff to Csaba but he wouldn't admit it to a soul even if it meant hanging. <#/>He changes and says aloud that he cannot be afraid of Csaba. <#/>This show
s that Waweru in true essence is very much afraid of Csaba than anything else. <#/>But we hereby find that he cannot admit it to any soul not even his own soul.
\par <#/>On pages 25 in a duel with Csaba Waweru tells us that he looked around to see if anybody had
 noticed his superpunch. <#/>But to his disappointment everybody was busy with their own things. <#/>Even the trainer had his back on them. <#/>This was very disappointing to Waweru and its in this disappointment that we find humour lying.
\par <#/>Just before 
the fight with the Arabs, Waweru tells us about one scare. <#/>A situation when he had gone to the toilets and he was told by one of the Hungarians that Erika was being disturbed. <#/>Waweru informs us that once the Hungarians are drunk they become great 
f
riends. <#/>They can't notice even if you trod on their food, your are no longer a stinking nigger. <#/>He was told by a Hungarian that he should have been a Cuban. <#/>The Hungarian was convinced beyond any doubt that Waweru was a Cuban and he was busy a
s
king for Havana cigars. <#/>He believed that Waweru should have been a close relative to Castro of Cuba. <#/>Waweru knew he must have been very drunk for he himself started thinking that he was a relative of Castro. <#/>He believed that Castro was his unc
le.
\par <#/>Zsuzsa was looking for Kovaks and Waweru was looking for Erika. <#/>Zsuzsa and Waweru met and were asking from each other their appropriate counterparts. <#/>What amuses me in the decision made by Waweru that since Erika and Kovaks were not around, 
they could be in the same place keeping an eye on each other. <#/>For them also they should keep an eye on each other. <#/>Zsuzsa being a lustful lover says that that was what she was even going to suggest. <#/>This is on page 72.
\par <#/>Two pages later Wawer
u is training Zsuzsa how to dance to a reggae music. <#/>The funny thing is that she never knew how to dance the reggae tunes and many times she lost steps. <#/>Humorous thing about it is that for the second reggae number, she missed a step and it was aga
inst racism. <#/>It went thus;<quote_><X_>}{\v "Until the philosophy which holds one race superior and another inferior is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned"}{<quote/>. <#/>She missed the step for she could not get it <quote_>}{\v 
'until the philosophy which holds one race superior and another inferior is finally abandoned'}{</X><quote/>. <#/>Indeed she was a master of racism.
\par <#/>On page 83 is the scene where Kovaks, Zsuzsa, Erika and Waweru slept together. <#/>Waweru woke up and looked at the others who 
were sleeping. <#/>Others were in deep sleep except for Zsuzsa who stirred. <#/>She was a half asleep and stared at Waweru. <#/>Waweru scared her by closing the eyes and opening the mouth. <#/>To this extend she screamed. <#/>I laugh realising that Waweru
 is an adult and what he did surely I could not expect such from him.
\par <#/>The USA meeting from page 86 starts with a lot of noise in the room. <#/>The first sense of humour is when Mustafa and others who had climbed on the table fall down when the table cou
ld no longer withhold the weight. <#/>There was a great hush in the room as Mustafa is very hurt. <#/>When he goes back to stage the students listen to him for a while. <#/>Mustafa was even afraid when he was given another table to stand on. <#/>In the sa
me scene many students denied having any knowledge of who Amina was. <#/>This was just a pretence. <#/>The chairman told Ogandipe <quote_><X_>}{\v \ldblquote 
Shut up woman you gave me the money when I was between your legs and you might get it back when I'am there that is if you behave yourself\rdblquote }{
</X><quote_> (page 91). <#/>This was very obscene and many shall laugh since the chairman implies that he would return the money only when she behaves well and when he will be between her legs.
\par <#/>On page 101 at the swimming pool W
aweru wanted to go swimming with a strange lady who was a blonde. <#/>Waweru winked after he saw she was very beautiful. <#/>He was with the intention of taking her with him to swimming without arousing the attention of Zsuzsa and Erika. <#/>Suddenly as h
e was in the heart of meditation, Erika approached him suddenly and asks \ldblquote Nice girl hmm? <#/>\rdblquote  Waweru had nothing to answer but cheated her by denying any knowledge of the lady.
\par <#/>Page 109 After Zsuzsa and Waweru were caught fornicating, Waweru pulled the
 door with assumption that Zsuzsa had had enough time to dress up herself. <#/>This was a great miscalculation, the towel was still spread on the floor and she had not dressed up.
\par <#/>The next funny thing was that by the scene, Erika was present. <#/>They met the eyes and it was very disappointing.
\par <#/>On page 115, Abacha and Waweru were two contrasting characters. <#/>Abacha solely believed that Erika threw out Waweru because Waweru was a black. <#/>Humour part of it is that Abacha suggests that a black gi
rl could have done it respectively. <#/>I also like Waweru wonder how a girl could leave you respectfully when she has found you fornicating with her friend.
\par <#/>On page 133 I find it <-_humerous><+_humorous> when Illonka and Zsuzsa claims that they wanted
 to rape Waweru because Waweru , they believed never finished love. <#/>I laugh when I find Waweru not even scared and he goes on to say that he has got no hurry going to the hostels. <#/>Just before the raping on page 138 Illonka cautions Zsuzsa that she
 should not rape Waweru till she gets back.
\par <#/>On page 145 Waweru stands and goes to dance with another person. <#/>He talked and whispered to her ear. <#/>He placed on a charming smile. <#/>The humour about is that Waweru did not expect what he found out.
 <#/>That was a man like he and not a girl! <#/> <-/infact> with <-/beards>. <#/>He was abused by the man who thought Waweru was a gay.
\par <#/>Waweru meets Margit on page 165. <#/>When they had gone to sleep, she told Waweru to leave her so that she may sleep
 for she was very tired. <#/>Waweru, in mind asked himself if he was a Saint Joseph or anything next to that. <#/>On page 169 Waweru claims that his safety valve could not contain the pressure any longer, he had played enough for Saint Joseph. <#/>Waweru 
discovers that the girl was a virgin and he says that, that was the last thing he was expecting from her. <#/>The last laughable part is when the girl asserts; <quote_>}{<X_>}{"}{\v Thank you, I don't even know your name!!"}{</X><quote/>
\par <#/>On page 180 Waweru stays with Bacs
i the trainer. <#/>Waweru was given very little food and this made him protest but he had nothing to do but to eat the food. <#/>Bacsi tells him that he should regain from eating any meal outside his house. <#/>In Wawerus mind, he knew very well that he c
ould go to the college canteen and buy meals. <#/>As if Bacsi was reading his mind, he informs Waweru that he had taken all his money when Waweru had gone to bathe.
\par <#/>On page 194 Waweru applies jelly to one of the clubmates. <#/>The clubmate asks Waweru if there were gays in Kenya. <#/>Waweru not knowing the motive behind the asking answers that \ldblquote queers are everywhere\rdblquote 
. <#/>Clubmate is very inquisitive and wanted to know Waweru`s stand or position in the issue. <#/>This makes Waweru to discover his motive and quickly informs him that he is not interested. <#/>Humour lies in the replies, the man told Waweru;
\par <quote_><X_>}{\v "Give it a try man. My friend has a room in town. His mother is out most of the day. I'll make it worth your while. }{<#/>}{\v You will even forget I'm not a girl honestly.\rdblquote }{
</X><quote/> <#/>As if not enough, Waweru gives a humour;
\par <quote_><X_> }{\v ". . . I have my girlfriend and if you must know I screw her three times a day, seven days a week. }{<#/>}{\v I don't need your time understand?\rdblquote }{</X><quote/>
\par <#/>On page 83 Waweru annoys Erika very much when Zsuzsa was scared and was crying. <#/>She asks Waweru if he had tried to screw her. <#/>He in reply wished that he had screwed her.
\par <#/>Therefor humour in the text is heavily based on <-_racialism><+_racism>. <#/>This is as seen Waweru's seat could not be occupied and when the young child inquisitively wanted to know the reason to why Waweru was black and ugly.
\par <#/>Humour is based on adoption of a language among the youth. <#/>Waweru has adopted an indecent language. <#/>At the meeting, the chairman retorts at one of the girl student who had claimed her money from him, using a very indecent language.
\par <#/>There is humour in flashback. <#/><-_Its><+_It's> applied in the scene that Waweru gives us a humour about when he was young and he had licked sugar. <#/>He denied but the mirror revealed it all. <#/>It was disappointing for him.
\par <X}{\v _><#/>Humour based on misconception. <#/>Waweru receives a telephone call and thinks she was Erika but he was Bacsi the trainer. <#/>When 
he told the father to Jozsi "Mother-fucker" it was due to a great misconception of characters. The drunkard who thought he was Castro's relative said so due to misconception. 
\par <#/>Sex humour is prevalent. <#/>When Zsuzsa meets Waweru and they commit sex, Waweru explains this in a very humorous way when he talks about "the stolen fruit". 
\par <#/>Sarcasm is also part of the humour. <#/> Zsuzsa and Waweru were caught. <#/>This shows sarcasm to the writer. <#/>This aspect is also seen as Waweru scares Zsuzsa. <#/>
Irony is humour that is ironic is clearly seen at the swimming pool. <#/>Waweru wanted to swim with another lady apart from Zsuzsa and Erika. <#/>As he was still meditating, Erika approaches him and asks him if the lady is beautiful. 
\par <#/>Waweru expecting to use his money to eat from the canteen is told by Bacsi that his money had been taken when he had gone to bathe. 
\par <#/>There is humour based on character traits. <#/>Abacha and Waweru are two contrasting characters. <#/>There's humour when they meet to argue out a point. <#/>This amuses since they all land in a disagreement. 
\par <#/>I believe anyone will agree with me that humour opens and finally closes the text. <#/>It has been represented in a way to <-_soround><+_surround> Waweru, the narrator and the mai
n character. <#/>As one goes through the book he/she will not help laughing aloud to himself, smiling broadly at the text and going back to repeat reading some arguments that are interesting. 
\par <#/>Therefor humour has been used to strengthen the themes of the text, to show true and untrue love, how Africans are treated (<-_racialism><+_racism>) and how both relate each other. }{</X></I>

\par <#/>Humour can be defined as an amusement aspect, which in most cases, is used in artistic work such as novels. <#/>It's a style which can have an ironic twist 
or satirise an issue or depict an idea in a way that cannot cause great commotion. <#/>Humour adds flavour to a work of an art therefore, making readers to laugh and initiates them to concentrate (be eager) more on the work. <#/>The aspect of humour as to
 such, has been and is being used in various works for amusement for instance, it's used in our local press: 'The Daily Nation' in the whispers column and which <-/infact> influences readers' attention.
\par <#/>In Omondi Mak'Oloo's novel Times Beyond, the idea 
of humour has been used for several purposes for example, it has been applied to add 'salt' and of course to draw the readers' attention. <#/>The author depicts all these through the I narrator-Waweru, who is very understandable more especially to the rac
ist environment he's in and handles all the matters which come across his life in a light manner.
\par <#/>Several instances have been used to show humour at work. <#/>The first instance is seen in the beginning of the book whereby, we find a dialogue between a 
mother and her little daughter; which amuses us a lot. <#/>The child asks her mother what kind of uncle is Waweru. <#/>The mother answers that he's '...a nigger uncle' and the child goes a head to ask as to why he's black while the mother answers that he 
c
omes from Africa. <#/>The child's exclamatory remark "Pfui! <#/> He's so ugly. <#/>" plus her mother's answers "Because he comes from Africa", "Because his parents are black" and "Because they sunbathe too much" asserts more amusement to the context or co
n
versation. <#/>Not only that this humorous incident makes us laugh, but also introduces us to the idea of racism that is shown by the author. <#/>This context depicts the racial aspect in this society where the Whites who are the majority, shows their hos
t
ility against Waweru and other blacks. <#/>Moreover, the mother in the conversation portrays how little the Hungarians know about the outside world; which appears to be a phenomenon for instance Africa is seen by her to be very far away: hence blacks come
 only from there. <#/>The way she suggests that Waweru is black due to much sunbathing is vague and beside being <-_humourous><+_humorous>, it shows how ignorant she is.
\par <#/>The second incident, which <-_despites><+_depicts> humour, is when the I narrator is in Erika's room and admires himself in a mirror; as he was preparing to leave for classes. <#/><quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24 
"I went to the mirror to comb my hair and looked at my black face. }{\fs24 <#/>}{\v\fs24 My nose was flat and wide, almost as wide as my mouth....}{\fs24  <#/>}{\v\fs24 'You are a typical African and proud of it' I told the guy in the mirror and winked. }
{\fs24 <#/>}{\v\fs24 He apparently agreed with me because he winked back."}{\fs24 </X><quote/> <#/>This episode is used by the author in describing Waweru. <#/>He gives Waweru a chance to depict his feelings ab
out himself to the audience. <#/>He therefore, describes (the <-_humourous><+_humorous> aspect) himself as if it's somebody else and shows how proud he is about his skin colour and image; despite the fact that he is black and subjected to racial discrimin
ation. <#/>This is quite interesting to us as readers and ironical on the other hand on the side of the Hungarians.
\par <#/>Earlier on, we encounter another instance which is full of humour. <#/>In this context, Waweru is listening to the radio and happens to c
atch the news about the cold war between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. <#/>The way he suggests is full of amusement 'When would the fools get down to fighting and be over with it instead of terrorising the world with suspense? <#/>...
 
Neither has said okey, what we are doing is utter insanity and detrimental to the whole of mankind. <#/>From now on, nuclear power will be used for peaceful purposes only, and some of the billion of dollars and roubles we spend daily in arming ourselves t
o
 the teeth will go to feed those undernourished Indians and Niggers of the third world. <#/>If we feel that the monkeys don't deserve too much <-_charety<+_charity>, the we can use the money to better the living standard of our own folks at home', This pa
s
sage is humorous beside depicting a serious issue. <#/>The use of the word 'nigger'- recalling the conversation between the mother and her daughter, shows that Waweru is not a fool and understands the whole issue of racism which is practised by the white.
 <#/>Due to this, he realises that they cannot easily help people of the third world 'Indians and Niggers' and ironically he gives them the option of using the money to better the <-_lifes><+_lives> of their folks instead of using it on arming themselves.

\par <
#/>Moreover, the conversation on telephone between Waweru and Jozsi's father is humorous. <#/>When Waweru rang to his friend Joszi for help in class work, he thought that he was the one who was talking. <#/>Waweru used obscene language which offended Jozs
i
's father hence initiating a quarrel between a father and his son. <#/>The passage makes us laugh more especially when Jozsi asks Waweru whether they have telephones in Africa! <#/> Besides showing a bit of racism and humiliation, it also shows variation 
of language use in that a language used precisely by the youths can offend and cannot be <-_accomodated><+_accommodated> by the older people.
\par <#/>In addition, the telephone conversation between Waweru and Gyula Bacsi after the ordeal with Jozsi spells out h
umour. <#/>This time, Waweru mistook Bacsi his boxing coach for his girlfriend Erika. <#/>"It's gorgeous! <#/>" I was grinning from ear to ear. <#/>'Vaveru? <#/>' It was a man's voice. <#/>My heart tumbled to my boots'. <#/>The humour in this case is seen
 
in Waweru who eagerly waited for the soothing voice of Erika but in contrast; he's shocked with Gyula Bacsi's voice. <#/>Furthermore, the punchline of this humour is seen when Bacsi answers back 'Exactly! <#/>' ejaculated Gyula Bacsi. <#/>'Exactly', he re
peated. <#/><quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24 'That's why you can't do well in the ring. <#/>I told you to keep off women, my boy, but you denied having anything with them. <#/>Now you see? <#/>
Your head is so full of women that you can't think of anything else.'...'To ...to the extent of mistaking me for your bird,..'}{\fs24 
</X><quote/> <#/>This passage makes the reader to understand Waweru as regards to the theme of love whereby, he loves his Erika much. <#/>It also introduces us to the boxing life of Waweru. <#/>And in this case, the
 coach is upset and asserts on the cause of Waweru's deteriorating standards in boxing, which is a reality. <#/>The truth hurts Waweru who tries to defend himself "...Can't we talk about this later? <#/>..." The two parties oppose each other and so increa
se the humour effect.

<#/>The conversation between Waweru and Abacha is humorous and takes an ironic twist. <#/>This is seen in page seventy whereby, they talk about the USA meeting meant to raise money for Amina; a Sudanese girl who had an abortion. <#/>'T
hat small Sudanese girl' 'An abortion? <#/>...say isn't it Amina who had a Hungarian boyfriend? <#/>" Such quotations plus the issue of Waweru knowing what Abacha was thinking about (as he was also thinking the same) as they kept quiet is quite interestin
g
. <#/>Furthermore, the I narrator adds that they had an unwritten rule which prohibited African girls from being befriended by white boys (meaning they were to move with blackboys only); but never restricted the boys is humorous: "There was an unwritten r
u
le among us that the boys could move with white girls if they wished, while the girls should only take black boys for boyfriends". <#/>This actually shows an opposite case in that not only the white, but Africans also practised racial segregation. <#/>The
 
aspect of 'relief supplies' to be imported from Africa due to shortage of black girls adds more amusement into this context. <#/>Beside that, it also shows the male chauvinism and dominance over their female counterparts who are seen as sex objects if not
 'goods for transportation'.

"What are you people pretending to be surprised about an abortion for? <#/>I can mention at least ten women in this room who have had an abortion and I was responsible!"}{\fs24

is, the author uses it to depict such serious issues in human life in a light way.
\par <#/>During the boxing competition, Waweru was ordered by his coach Gyula Bacsi to apply liniment on his fellow light welter boxer. <#/>'Give him the works. <#/>Right from the

While he was on his way to deliver Bela Bacsis money after the day's business, Waweru encountered a prostitute. <#/>The woman was carrying out some business and Waweru happened to buy
 a Swiss watch from her using Bacsis money without permission. <#/>The humour part of it is depicted when the woman saw the cashbox full of money and had much zeal for the money "Is that your money? <#/>" She held the door and insisted to stay while she w

\par <#/>The word civilization is derived from a Latin word, <foreign/>civis which represent an actual social condition of the citizens
. <#/>It was contrasted with barbarism, another social condition, which was originally a description of the life of a foreign group.
\par

"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, customs, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society. <#/>" To him, it is in this sense that all human societies have a "culture" and a "civilization"
.

and technology and as universal and accumulative in that it reveals to nature rather than to man. <#/>Macluer, made a broadly similar distinction; he related culture to ends and civilization to means and viewed the technological order of civilization as d
etermined with the cultural order of means and values.
\par 
\par <#/>Another social scientist, V. Gordon Childe defined civilization as being the city. <#/>He coined the term, "urban revolution" to characterise the achievement of civilization. <#/>To him, terms "civ
ilization" and "urban revolution" are <-_equalent><+_equivalent>. <#/>He stated that the urban revolution was the culmination of a process of progressive change in economic structure and social organization; the city was the "resultant and symbol" of this
 
revolution. <#/>He cited ancient Mesopotamia as having had a parallel and direct link between development of cities and civilization. <#/>Among the qualities of civilization according to Childe include a stratified social structure, a highly differentiate
d
 occupational hierarchy, a well defined political structure, and integration as being fostered through a state ideology which reaffirm the basic unity of the society. <#/>He contented that "city" and "civilization" have all these characteristics and hence
 are the same and one.
\par 
\par <#/>There are other scholars, among them, Julian H. Stewart who have employed an "ecological perspective" in their approach to analysis and determination of the concept of civilization. <#/>This approach directs attention to how the 
members of a given society are related to their environment - particularly to how they exploit it and to the network of social relations involved - in an effort to determine in what ways these relations illumine other aspects of their social system.

\par 
\par <#/>A
nthropologists use the concept of civilization in opposition to the notions of primitive and folk cultures. <#/>As a taxonomical category it applies to cultural types characterised by organic heterogeneity and correlatively complex society structures. <#/
>Civilized societies are typically stratified and segmented.
\par 
\par <#/>In evolutionary terms, the achievement of civilization represents a definitive stage in the development of society and culture; as such, it contrasts with savagery and barbarism, the levels o
f integration that preceded civilization in the course of mankind's progress. <#/>In that regard, the achievement of civilization presupposes the attainment of a considerable degree of efficiency in food production; the economic foundations of civilizatio
n
 are everywhere based firmly on agricultural productivity which is facilitated by means of land reclamation, soil conservation, hydraulic control, etc. <#/>Also civilization entails technological advancement - not only skills and crafts, but also developm
ent of managerial skills.
\par 
\par <#/>According to Robert Redfield, a reputable sociologist, civilization is a revolutionary change in the relative importance in society of the moral order and the technical order. <#/>He viewed the criteria that serve to different
iate civilization from the stage of barbarism as being the social, moral, and intellectual. <#/>To him, civilization is the transformation of the folk community into civilized society. <#/>The moral order in a civilized society is institutionalized in con
t
rast with the traditional ethnical systems of the homogenous local communities. <#/>He used the concepts of, "the great tradition" and "little tradition" to mark a sharp distinction between folk culture and civilized culture. <#/>He called the "great trad
i
tion" a civilized or high culture. <#/>It is a cultural system shaped by reflective ideas, speculative thought, and it is consciously cultivated, systematized, and transmitted. <#/>The "little tradition" on the other hand is constituted by the Love, belie
fs, folk wisdom, and artistic expressions of the common people - It is a "low" or "lay" culture. <#/><-_Its><+_It's> <-_molded><+_moulded> by customs and <-_its><+_it's> refractory to innovation.
\par 
\par <#/>Another scholar, Friedrich Engels sharpened the concept 
of civilization as a social phenomena by refining the general scheme of social evolution by defining the transition from one stage to the next with reference to social and economic conditions. <#/>In economic relations, there is control of the means of pr
o
duction including human labour by ruling classes which assume the centralization and redistribution of surpluses, and the allocation of a labour force for public works, networks of exchange controlled by a professional merchant class or by the state, that
 
supersede the direct exchange of goods and services. <#/>In the political structure, there must be a centralized executive and administrative functions. <#/>The state is integrated on the bases of social class and residence - instead of tribal organizatio
n
, based on descent and kinship. <#/>He also viewed the rise of civilization as being accompanied by radical transformations of the ethnical systems. <#/>As relations among men change, so do man's views of the universe. <#/>The moral order becomes insituti
o
nalized: A hierarchical class of priests, state-managed cults, and a sociomorphic conception of the supernatural world. <#/>Conversely, man becomes a creature of the gods, and society is understood as a manifestation of the cosmic harmony, thus, the new s
o
cial order comes to be viewed as the product of divine sanction. <#/>Ethical life acquires new dimensions with the rise of moral orders more inclusive than the traditional moral order of the local communities or tribal groups. <#/>The revolutionary change
s
 in the structure of society stimulate moral creativeness. <#/>Engels also stated that in the means of intellect, civilization is marked by the development of speculative thought, the expansion of time consciousness, the elaboration of exact and predictiv
e
 sciences, the adoption of conventional symbols for recording and transmitting information, and the fixing of standards of time and space, and eventually also of weight. <#/>Finally, Friedrich took the expansion in aesthetic consciousness as a product of 
t
he attainment of civilization. <#/>To him, a high art (the art of the high or civilized culture) characterized by conceptualized and sophisticated styles becomes differentiated, superseding the old forms of communal art and relegating them to a subordinat
e level. <#/>The new styles are the produce of the creative activities of specially trained, professional - minded artists - craftsmen who labour to meet the demands of an elite of art patrons imbued with the new spirit.
\par 
\par <#/>There are other intellectuals w
ho have tried to define the concept of civilization by demonstration and illustration. <#/>Among them is Ferdinand Tonnies who made a comparative distinction between a civilized community which he called <foreign/>Gesellschaft and uncivilized one which he
 
called <foreign/>Gemeinschaft. <#/>The <foreign/>Gesellschaft is characterized by reason, everybody is by himself and isolated, there is growth of city life, growth of state and of national life. <#/>There is also an elaborate trade system and relationshi
p
s are constructual and functional. <#/>On the other hand, the <foreign/>Gemeinschaft which he also called a "community of feeling" has associative unity of ideas and emotions that results from likeness and from shared life-experience. <#/>The relations ar
e based on kinship, neighbourhood, collective proprietorship and it has a domestic economy. <#/>Tonnies thesis is that a period of <foreign/>Gesellschaft follows a period of <foreign/>Gemeinschaft.
\par 
\par <#/>Also, Emile Durkheim illustrated the meaning of the co
ncept of civilization by using the term social solidarity as the index. <#/>He distinguished a civilized society from a primitive one by referring them as being governed or sustained by organic solidarity and mechanical solidarity respectively. <#/>In mec
h
anical solidarity, social cohesion is based on likeness, collective conscience and homogeneity. <#/>In contrast, the organic solidarity is characterised by social solidarity based on the interdependence of specialized parts. <#/>Durkheim concluded that or
g
anic solidarity progresses as mechanical solidarity regresses. <#/>To him, the evolution of society can therefore be seen in terms of the passage from mechanical solidarity to organic solidarity, with "mechanical" or "organic" referring to the dominant ty
pe of solidarity relationship at each evolutionary stage. <#/>He emphasized on division of labour as the source of solidarity in modern society.
\par 
\par <#/>Again, Robert Redfield used his theory of "the Folk-Urban Continuum" in relation to a civilized and uncivil
ized people or culture. <#/>He characterised Folf Society as being small, isolated, nonliterate, homogeneous, having a strong sense of group solidarity, behaviour being traditional and sacred orientation of their lives. <#/>The people within a folk societ
y
 are uncritical, have no reflection to intellectual ends and have a kinship-based relationship. <#/>Their economy is one of status rather than of the market. <#/>The urban society on the other side is characterised by the antithesis of attributes of the f
olk society.
\par 
\par <#/>From all the above definitions and explanations of the concept of civililzation, its clear and correct to firmly accept the assertion that, "civilization is when things work the way we expect them to". <#/>However, I would like to refute t
he conception of V. Gordon Childe of civilization being a city. <#/>Civilization is attained by man's endeavour to improve the quality of his life. <#/>I hence do not see any relation between civilization and urbanization because I tend to think civilizat
ion being a mark of a certain stage or state of man's social and cultural circumstances can be anywhere within the social and cultural parameters.
\par 
\par <#/>Civilzation can in a way be equated with the concept of development if development takes into account not
 only economic development, but also take into consideration the social and cultural dimension of progress. <#/>Among indicators of sustainable development which may be seen as civilization include foot security which is ensured through the sustainable us
e
 of physical resources and environment, basic economic security which guarantees the fullness employment of each individual's talents and skills through both the formal sector and the household mobilization system, national institutional security by estab
l
ishment and sustainable operation of national systems responsible for the mobilization of geographical and geo-economic support for its priority programme for long-term national development, including a dynamic sense of national peace; security; and cohes
i
on, the development of a national vibrant knowledge industry consisting of University institutions, a scientific research and technological development system, the agro-business and industry domain, the publishing industry and entrepreneurial institutions
, and designed to underpin the inputs into and extend the outputs, etc.
\par 
\par <#/>By civilization, man ensures his survival and a life worth of him. <#/>Human beings must as a matter of their interest and welfare forge a synthesis of ideas, values and practices 
which would together constitute some notion of an ordered universe, and could specify for man a set of purposes in relation to that synthesis. <#/>As the word and our knowledge of it change, this synthesis must change too, so as to make it adequate to cha
nging and changed circumstances.
\par 
\par <#/>I would also like to take the idea of cultural evolution to be parallel or to some extent to be the same as the process of civilization. <#/>Social and cultural evolution have been able to steer the progress of human-ki
nd from its almost "animal-like" primitive conditions to the sophisticated forms of its present civilization. <#/>Man has been able to progress not only by adapting to the natural environment but also by adapting this environment to his needs. <#/>He has 
m
anaged to create an artificial world - world of artefacts with the advancement of civilization. <#/>This issue of cultural evolution and process of civilization is clearly stated by Charles Darwin in his theory of evolution in his book entitled, "The orig
in of species", whereby he stated that, <quote_>}{\v\fs24 ".. no one species can hold a particular place in the economy of nature for ever. }{\fs24 <#/>}{\v\fs24 
At every moment each place is up for grabs and sooner or later a replacement will be found and the old occupant shoved out of the circle to perish alone."}{\fs24 
<quote/> <#/>Within the context of cultural evolution or the process of civilization this simply means that old or outdated systems comprised of material and non-material culture must give way to new systems which are more co
mplex and sophisticated than the previous one to cope up with the prevailing social situation.
\par 
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24 <#/>I would like to conclude by saying that civilization as being determined by our expectations of how things should work can only be realized or attained 
if man lives a happy life in this world. <#/>I have taken happiness to be the ultimate goal man can aspire to achieve. <#/>Happiness can only be got if man make proper use of his personality to relate to his fellow men and the nature. <#/>He can do this b
y
 establishment of good and up-to-date social networks, progressive development and modernization of non-material and material culture for the welfare of mankind and all this is what I can term as civilization being when things work the way we expect them 
to.

\par <#/>The term civilization derives from a social condition <foreign/>'civis' (in Latin) meaning citizen.
\par 
\par <#/>Civilization is <-_archeologicaly><+_archeologically> and <-_historicaly><+_historically> defined as a culture which is maintained by a large population, over a long time, which includes an establi
shment of political organizations centred on cities, palaces and temples, the use if uniting and the development of specialized occupations.}{\cs17\fs24\super \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain \s16\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \fs20 {\cs17\super \chftn }

\par 
\par <#/>Webster defines civilization as an ideal state of human culture characterized by complete absence of barbari
sm and non-rational behaviour, optimum utilization of physical, cultural <-/>cultural, spiritual and human resources and perfect adjustment of the individual within the social framework. <#/>As the progressive development of arts, sciences, <?/>statecraft
 and human aspirations and spirituality.
\par 
\par <#/>It is a particular stage of cultural development at which writing and the keeping of written records is attained. <#/>A stage marked by Urbanization, advanced technology/techniques in agriculture and industry, e
xpanded population and complex social organization which are not independent of technology. <#/>It is the whole of the advances of human culture and aspirations beyond the purely animal level.
\par 
\par <#/>This definitions carry with them other concepts that need clarification for a better understanding and reflection of what civilization is.
\par 
\par <#/>Non-rationality would simply imply the lack of reasoning in the process of Judgement. <#/>In relation to civilization, it would then mean that civilization is not judgement minus reasoning. <#/>It is not a mere effect of emotions and/or intuition.

\par 
\par <#/>I will take the term development to imply a process of natural growth, differentiation or gradual/successive change from a less perfect stage to a more perfected one. <#/>Th
is would mean that the human being (who is my greatest concern on this issue of civilization) advances from a simpler state of existence to a more complex state in relation to himself and to others in structure, function and motive. <#/><-/Infact>, all th
at would be examined under civilization must show such gradual progression.
\par 
\par <#/>On many occasions, civilization is contrasted with barbarism which I take to imply/refer to the social condition of offending the already established regard for correctness, or
/and purity. <#/>A condition of deviance. <#/>When one contrasts civilization with barbarism he/she actually implies that civilization is the adherence to some established social values.
\par 
\par <#/>In their genesis about the emergence of the state, early philoso
phers may have had such a contrast in mind. <#/>What I am trying to propose is that at the time of their argumentation, the society they were living in had already established some values which must have influenced their intellect one way or the other.

\par 
\par <#
/>John Locke and Thomas Hobbes assume that man at first lived in a state of nature/anarchy where society, government and organized <-_coexcion><+_coercion> of individual by the group existed. <#/>Men therefore made a covenant by which they abandoned their
 
'state of nature' to form a society in which they now live. <#/>They made a social contract which is assumed to have had men surrender their natural rights or liberties in order to enjoy the order and safety of the organized society. <#/>This can lead one
 to safely assert that civilization is the attainment of order and safety as needed by the individuals.
\par 
\par <#/>Assuming that every individual was on his own (which is not perfectly true as the family component must have existed somehow), each individual must 
have had some established values. <#/>When such values are threatened men must have then 'decided' to surrender their liberties for the security of other greater values, say life. <#/>What I am calling decision here could be what Rousseau meant by asserti
ng that it was the }{\fs24\ul general will}{\fs24 
 that <-_necessited><+_necessitated> the establishment of reciprocal rights, duties, privileges and responsibilities which form the basis of the state. <#/>The state at this time is an organization and as per the definition, civilization.
\par 
\par <#/>The concept culture derives from a Latin metaphorical term <foreign/>'cultura', derived from the act of cultivating the soil.}{\cs17\fs24\super \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain \s16\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \fs20 {\cs17\super \chftn }{

\par 
\par <#/>According to Webster, culture means that total pattern of human behaviour and its products embodied in th
ought, speech, action and artefacts and dependent upon man's capacity for learning and transmitting knowledge to succeeding generations through the use of tools, language, and systems of abstract thought. <#/>It is the body of customary beliefs, social fo
rms, and material traits constituting a distinct complex tradition of a racial, religious or a social group.
\par 
\par <#/>Culture could be said to be a general habit of the mind as related to human perfection, a general state of intellectual and moral development i
n a society as a whole, a body of the arts and intellectual work and as the whole way of life, material, intellectual, and spiritual of a society.
\par 
\par <#/>From this definitions of culture, on can assert that the process of civilization traces back to the time
 of development of knowledge, opinion and belief. <#/>Infact civilization traces back to thought as the very first step from non-rationality. <#/>The development of language, as a communication medium, establishment of symbols, gestures, art, graphics and
 writing, - the basis of communication as understood today- forms the basis of civilization.
\par 
\par <#/>The 'state of nature' is associated with hunting and gathering, and more <-/pronouncingly> the non-existed of law and order, life was short, nasty and brutal 
in this kind of state. <#/>However comparable man was to the other animals, he could exercise some kind of extra-rationality by not only hunting and gathering but by also fishing and using floating tools for instance, logs, and some <-/porking> sticks. <#
/>This could be an indication or a trace of civilization at the stage of the 'stage of nature'.
\par 
\par <#/>However, the most crucial stage is that of 'deciding' to bring up the social contract in mention by Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau. <#/>For such an act to be ef
fected, rationality must have come to play. <#/>There must have been a thought, a medium of communication that was understood by a fairly large group to necessitate deliberations and <-/infact>, adoption of what was agreed upon. <#/>This act(s) of communi
cating, deliberating and adopting of set objectives is in itself an organizational process and in essence, the making of what the participants wanted, hence civilization.
\par 
\par <#/>It was not until the new stone age that domestication of plants and animals was p
ractised. <#/>This marked the beginning of the modern conceptualization of civilization. <#/>It was the beginning of settlements which were at first semi-permanent but became permanent gradually. <#/>When <-_archeologists><+_archaeologists> define civiliz
ation as including specialized occupation, this domestication must be a major contributor because of the existent practise of farming and ranching and <-/nomadism>.
\par 
\par <#/>Settled communities especially in Mesopotamia and Egypt among others, are said to have experiences climatic changes at around 4000 BC which is thought to have rendered fertile lands barren.}{\cs17\fs24\super \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain 
\s16\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \fs20 {\cs17\super \chftn }{ Clapman (Ibid) Pg 13}}}{\fs24  <#/>This could have called for adoption and because of the presence of water masses, rivers for instance, the rise of irrigation systems was inevitable.

\par 
\par <#/>The use of such systems must have needed co-operation and indeed, co-ordination. <#/>This could explain the rise of organisations and at this stage, some direction from a centre. <#/>Being a fact that many settlements were in river valleys, with an e
xception of those that did not, the settlers had to cope with the flood situation from time to time. <#/>This too, may have necessitated co-operation and <-/infact> may have precipitated organizations.
\par 
\par <#/>This brings another approach to the study of civi
lization. <#/>The centre was to give instructions and the necessity, needed to arbitrate and enforce resolutions. <#/>This could also explain the rise of political structures such as councils (legislatures) to debate and pass resolutions, an executive (bu
reaucracy) to enforce the resolutions and a court (judicial system) to try those that refused to compel.
\par 
\par <#/>But there was the other need of defence and security so as to check deviance from within and from without the community. <#/>This could have resulted in police and the soldiery.
\par 
\par <#/>For effective administration, records had to be invented and assuming that writing was already in place, professionals had to emerge to deal with specific aspects of the society. <#/>For instance, professional scribes, l
awyers, clerks and other occupations resulted. <#/>Career administrators came in as administrative strategies had to be laid down and followed to achieve a defined goal.
\par 
\par <#/>The monitoring of such <-_occurances><+_occurrences> like floods may be responsib
le for the emergence of calenders. <#/>Calenders were, of course, worked out by monitoring of the star patterns at a given time/season, remonitoring and predicting. <#/>This monitoring of stars gave the way for the development of astronomy and indeed, ast
rology.
\par 
\par <#/>Population increase and a changing environment led to more adoption. <#/>This saw the rise of the agrarian revolution which was targeted towards food sufficiency and supply. <#/>As a result of this, industrial revolution was to follow. <#/>The 
increase in production of raw <-_materilas><+_materials> meant the establishment of better refining gadgets. <#/>This was the industrial revolution which was characterized by invention of machines and the perfection of the existing ones. <#/>Iron was brou
ght into intense use. <#/>Occupations, Medicine for instance, was to develop and have its many branches of dentistry, say human, animal and plant medicines as there is today.
\par 
\par <#/>Increased food production did not lead to total sufficiency, insufficiency co
ntinued to exist and would later develop to trade. <#/>This was to be within the community/village and between different villages. <#/>I take the village at this stage to mean a settlement or a group of people who are settled in a given area. <#/>This set
t
lements would be organized in say, a kinship system of organization which would later develop to sophisticated political organizations and territories, but primarily first as persons of a common ancestry say for instance, the <-_bantu><+_Bantu>, <-_nilote
s><+_Nilotes> and <-_cushites><+_Cushites> and others. <#/>Such organizations at the very first time operated on basis of trust.
\par 
\par <#/>As an effect of trade, competition arose. <#/>It would target the domination of trade routes and domination of supplies of 
certain commodities. <#/>Backed by the already established institutions of the soldiery, conquest and state domination did result. <#/>The term state here is used to imply a single settlement or several settlements that have been made a single entity thro
u
gh conquest and domination. <#/>This could explain the existing behaviour of state. <#/>I am trying to draw attention to the culture of conquest, say colonialism, direct/indirectly by the modern state as an aspect of civilization. <#/>The behaviour of the
 
modern state of wanting her existence to be felt and recognized which could include the extension of territory, exploitation of others and indeed total control, political and economic, of another. <#/>Examples could include the invasion of Grenada by the 
U.S.A in the late 1980's, and that of Iraq over Kuwait. <#/>I am making the assumption that domination has developed into a culture.
\par 
\par <#/>Once conquered, the losers have their independence curtailed and their wealth claimed by the victors. <#/>The Akkadian empire, one of the earliest empires, is said to have developed by such means of conquest and so did many others. <#/>}{

 Increase of trade as a result of insufficiency led to the emergence of merchants. <#/>This put together with dominance, imperialism and a
s cause-effects, capitalism and colonialism developed. <#/>This may somehow qualify civilization when defined as culture and inevitably associated with dominance, to imply barbarism. <#/>I am saying this because there resulted deviance of some set values 
and <-/infact> somehow went against the social contract said before as liberties where to be secured at an equal level.
\par 
\par <#/>Imperialism at first is brought up as a check/struggle of dominance between establishments. <#/>The posed threat there could be real or imagined. <#/>For instance the expansion of the Assyrian empire which was aimed to counter Aramaean <?/>intansrous.

\par 
\par <#/>I want to make an emphasis that when viewing civilzation as a maintained culture, one needs not forget that the cultural values of
 a given people are very much influenced by the peoples environment. <#/>The cultural value I have in mind would include foods, clothing, belief and other customs. <#/>For instance, the intensity of the sun rays and the period of winter are pointed by Maz
rui to have had an effect on the emergence of certain things in Europe that were at that time not emerging in Africa.}{\cs17\fs24\super \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain \s16\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \fs20 {\cs17\super \chftn }{

y time, space and environment.
\par 
\par <#/>The emergence of "different civilizations" in Europe, China, Mesopotamia and Africa and the existent of diverse cultures is, therefore, not a surprise. <#/>One E.A.Taylor, defines civilization/culture, which he treats as

\par }{\fs24 <h> <#/>Topic: Although circumcision is a significant rite of passage, female circumcision should be eradicated in a modern society </h>
\par 
\par <#/>Although circumcision is a significant rite of passage, female circumcision should be eradicated in modern society.
\par <#/>Circumcision is a practice of initiating young members of a society into adulthood. <#/>In the African context, it is a highly religious affair in which everyone in the community must participate
. <#/>In almost all societies, it involves cutting or making a mark on the bodies of initiates which is both permanent and very significant.
\par <#/>In a secular context, female circumcision involves cutting off the clitoris from a woman's sex organ as a mark
 of transition from childhood to adulthood. <#/>In a deep context, female circumcision, or clitoridectomy not only involves bridging this gap from childhood to adulthood but also has various other meanings , inclusive of being a gateway to marriage.

\par <#/>F
emale circumcision has , in modern society ,come under a lot of controversy. <#/>This is in the light of its being a health hazard, an outdated practice as well as a violation of human right among others. <#/>Many people have campaigned against it with ve
hemence and choke so that some African countries have even banned the practice. <#/>However, despite this opposition and occasional censure, the practice has thrived unhindered, going underground in situations where it has been repressed.
\par <#/>This paper in
tends to show the <-/positiveness> of female circumcision, so much cherished by those who practice it, against it's dangers and risks ,which, as will be seen, have brought into the limelight by modernization. <#/>It would also be necessary to asses this i
ssue from an African point of view, and <-_speciaficlly><+_specifically> a Kenyan one, since these two situation are relevant to us today.
\par <#/>Circumcision , in general, involved a bond being made between the living and the dead. <#/>Mbiti (1992: 99) say t
hat through the <-_shadding><+_shedding> of blood, one made a communion with his or her community as well as his or her departed ancestors. <#/>Whether such a purpose for circumcision is relevant to a modern society is debatable. <#/>This is because force
s of religion, education and modernization have wiped a way beliefs in the living dead and other cherished ideas in traditional world.
\par <#/>Secondly, one was recognized as an adult after getting circumcised. <#/>Mbiti says that any person who did not underg
o this practice, whatever his her age, was still considered a child (ibid). <#/>However, in modern terms ,one's recognition as an adult may emanate from mental or physical growth and stature, getting married and other social or even spiritual developments
. <#/>These may be taken as a criterion to adult status.
\par <#/>Thirdly, initiation was a gateway to marriage. <#/>Mbiti (op.cit), says that one would not be viable for marriage, at whatever age, if he or she had not undergone this practice. <#/>It was virtua
lly a sole and very important prerequisite to marriage. <#/>During the healing period, the initiates were <-_adviced><+_advised> by elder members of the society on the secrets and mysteries of marriage life. <#/>However, modern society has no such prerequ
i
site for marriage. <#/>Love between those involved is cherished more than the question of what culture one identifies him or herself with. <#/>For marriage secrets, one may wonder which they are while every nitty gritty detail about marriage life is there
 for all who are literate enough to read in magazines, <-_newpapers><+_newspapers>, novels and other reading material.
\par <#/>Fourthly the scar left on the sex organ of the individual identified him or her with the community from which he or she came. <#/>But
 this may sound vague in a modern situation in that the scar is not overt for everyone to see, secondly, the need to identify oneself with only one's ethnic community will breed such issues as ethnocentricity , tribalistic chauvinism and many others, all 
evils in today's society.
\par <#/>Circumcision was also seen as a new birth. <#/>Both male and female were reborn in the tribe, this being marked by intensive feasting and appraisal by the whole community. <#/>Mbiti (1960:102) says that in some communities, th
e youth would acquire new names and drop old ones. <#/>Clothes worn during childhood would be set on fire, in a popular ceremony and the newly circumcised youths would wear new ones. <#/>This is one important aspect of initiation that can be noted. <#/>Ho
wever, the direct equal of initiation in modern society may be baptism, brought about by religion. <#/>People receive new names and acquire new status. <#/>It would be unnecessary then that a further adoption of names is done during circumcision.
\par <#/>Most important and relevant of all, circumcision was accompanied by intensive instruction on matters of sex, tribal secret among many others. <#/>Bottignole (1984:41) say that <quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24 
"... after having been extensively informed about their new status, their duties as adult and the secret of the tribal life, they could marry and have children ...''}{\fs24 
</X><quote/> <#/>Sex education was very much emphasized for all who had undergone the practice, to prepare them for a dutiful and responsible adulthood. <#/>This ma
y be said to lack today due to evils like prostitution, abortion, pre-marital sex, extra-marital affairs among many others. <#/>Modern society may probably borrow a leaf here.
\par <#/>Colonization, Western education and religion are very powerful forces that 
have affected African culture. <#/>Through these influences, many cultural practices of the African have been eroded, replaced by alien beliefs and practices and subsequently, a fully changed way of life. <#/>However, some practice are so deeply rooted in
 the mind of }{\b\v\fs24 <+_an>}{\fs24  African that it would take long and tiresome efforts to eradicate them.
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<#/>In the light of modernization, female circumcision is a health hazard and a cause of many other problems related to social, physical and spiritual aspects of li
fe. <#/>Why this was not and still is not so in the traditional sense is because colonization, Western education and religion had <-_no><+_not> much influence as to convince those practised it to stop.
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang2057 {<#/>}{\fs24 In world invaded by the AIDS menace, this practic
e poses a threat to those on whom it is done and secondly, those doing it. <#/>AIDS is a <-_contageous><+_contagious> venereal disease, caused by the HIV virus and has had no cure throughout the world. <#/>Apart from being caused or contracted through sex
u
al intercourse, it is also passed over through the use of unsterilized instruments on people, thus infecting them with the virus. <#/>In the tradtional sense, the practice offers an easy way through which this virus can be passed on to a whole group of yo
ungsters in the community. <#/>Kenyatta (1971:82) says that in the Kikuyu community, the surgeon's knife was only one and it was to be used on every youth who had to be initiated.
\par <#/>Secondly, the scar left on the woman's birth canal may bring about compl
ication at birth, painful birth and <-_sexsual><+_sexual> intercourse. <#/>Apart from this, it reduces sex libido for the woman, denying her the pleasure of an act supposed to be enjoyed by both partners in marriage. <#/>Writing about the position and rol
e of African women, Ssekamwa (1986:13) says, <quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24 "The African women is submissive and very hardworking. }{\fs24 <#/>}{\v\fs24 Women are taken to hold second rate role in African societies. }{\fs24 <#/>}{\v\fs24 
To say the least, it is a kind of slavery in some communities...''}{\fs24 </X><quote/> <#/>Her position thus, in addition to clitoridectomy, denies her a pleasure she is entitled to.
\par <#/>Thirdly, clitoridectomy expose women to chronic vaginal infections. <#/>The scar left on the mouth of the vagina after the removal of the clitoris is 
as good an abode as any for dangerous viruses and bacteria which may even lead to the death of the individual. <#/>Some scars may even fail to heal and the woman will experience a lot of pain from it all. <#/>Some may get circumcised shortly before marria
ge. <#/>Even though the scar may have healed, <-_sexsual><+_sexual> intercourse will rejuvenate and even expand it, this resulting to excessive and unbearable pain.
\par <#/>Fourthly, circumcision of women is a severe and painful act, which may be termed as inh
uman. <#/>Denying the woman the right to natural feeling of the body through cutting off of parts of that body is against humanity. <#/>In some Cushitic communities of Kenya like the Somalis and the Boran, some African countries like Ethiopia and Sudan as
 
well as parts of the middle East, the painful practice of infibulation is practised. <#/>This is the scrapping off of all external genitals of a woman, the clitoris, the labia minora and the labia majora. <#/>This is done with out any anaesthesia and with
 an unsterilised blade. <#/>This is more of mutiliation, punishment and infliction of pain than a deliberate wish to perpetuate any culture, however significant it may be.
\par <#/>Among the communities persisting with this practice, most doing it with delibera
te awareness of censure, opposition and discouragement from the Government or Govervments, the church, non-Governmental agencies, the press and the general world public. <#/>Female circumcison still thrives in Kenya, despite a Government ban imposed on it
 in August 1982 (Kahiga, Sunday Nation, 27th March, 1994: lifestyle 4 ) 
\par Many express their support for this practice in the belief that its failure or eradication may evoke a curse from the ancestors, may make one to miss a husband, may make a woman naught
y and dirty or may even make one excommunicated from the community as an outcast. <#/>It is, seen in the light of those ignorant of this practice, a thing of the past and can easily be eradicated. <#/>However it is deeply rooted in the minds of those who 
take the practice seriously and to convince them otherwise would take much effort .
\par <#/>Mbiti says that clitoridectomy is highly valued in all African communities. <#/>However, he adds that <quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24 "clitoridectomy is not <-_practiced><+_practised> in all communities as such. }{\fs24 <#/>}{\v\fs24 
Even where circumcision is not <-_practiced><+_practised>, there are other ways of marking the transition from childhood to adulthood ... brewing some beer and slaughtering a goat for the older men who ceremoniously welcome the 
young adolescent to their status''}{\fs24 
</X><quote/> (Mbiti, 1992 :97). <#/>Such a practice may successfully be adopted to replace the risky cutting off of the genitals for women. <#/>However, to divert the attention of those who uphold such a practice requires 
that they be made aware of its dangers. <#/>Miriam Kahiga suggests that education may be a useful tool to fight this practice quoting a research co-ordinator of the <ea_>Maendeleo ya wanawake<ea/> organisation, Kihiga says: 
\par Mrs. Muuya is convinced that female circumcision is not here to stay. <#/>With conscientious research and sensitivity, she say, people will make their own decisions. <#/><quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24 
"If we can only talk about it,'' She says, "discuss it with the people, let them hear themselves speak and then take it back to them and ask: <#/>This is what you said. What do you want to do about it. they will see the need to make a decision. <#/>
But we cannot force it down their throats much less than we can condemn it...''}{\fs24 </X><quote/> (Kahiga, Sunday Nation , 4th April 1994: lifestyle 5 )

The education of the masses is a very positive thing do to do in that it will not only help eradicate this practice, but will also accompany sex education which will curb the evils of pre- and extra-marital sex, pr

\par <h> <#/> DEFINITION </h>
\par <#
/>Circumcision according to Eliade, M et all (1987;511) is generally the surgical removal of the foreskin from the penis. <#/>Early social theorists speculated about circumcision's origins suggesting that it may have 1. marked captives thereby signifying 
s
ubjection, 2. attracted the opposite sex, 3. been a tribal or ethnic mark, 4. been hygienic, 5. increased sexual pleasure, 6. removed men from materials bonds, 7. tested bravery, 8. sacrificed part of the self to ensure future rebirth, 9. been a form of s
ymbolic castration to <-_suport><+_support> the domination of youths by their elders or even, 10. stimulated menstruation. <#/>However Eliade, et all are sceptical about the <-_acceptence><+_acceptance> of these theories today.
\par <#/>Circumcision for both male and female is one of the many rites of passages that has profound meaning and practice in Africa and the world at large. <#/>The rites of passage include, initiation which according }{\b\v\fs24 <+_to>}{\fs24 
 Hasting,j.(1980;314) means "going out'' from a prior state of lif
e be it worldly for an ordinary person or from a monastic life <-/incase> of one changing to another faith. <#/>Other forms of initiation include tooth removing, <-_tattoing><+_tattooing> to mention but a few. <#/>Naming denotes "arrival''- entering into 
the circle of the fully <-_acredited><+_accredited> members of the society. <#/>So are marriage and death and belief in the life after completes the circle of rites of passage.
\par 
\par <h> <#/> SIGNIFICANCE; </h>
\par <#/>From the <-_african><+_African> context with pa
rticular reference to the Kikuyu female circumcision, regard is taken to it as a the very essence of an institution with enormous educational, social, moral and religious implication quite far from the operation itself. <#/>The moral code is bound up with
 the customs symbolising the unification of the whole tribal organisation.
\par <#/>Its social significance lies in the fact that it marks the commencement of participation in various governing group in the tribal administration, because real age-groups begin fr
om the day of the physical operation thus raising the <-_girls's><+_girls'> social status from girlhood to womanhood.
\par <#/>The social persons and the natural person are brought into closer conjunction. <#/>The endurance of pain and <-/obsernce> of ritual re
striction express both a willingness and a capacity to subject personal appetites and feeling to collective ends. <#/>It is relational, as it establishes relationship with the living and the dead. <#/>It is experience of sharing life and a vision for life
 with the centre community.
\par <#/>Religiously it signifies the mystery of life and eath as being at its heart. <#/>The relationship between the initiate and the ancestors leads to God, The ultimate ancestor. <#/>Furthermore, sexual life for which initiation i
s a prelude, is direct connected to the origins of human experience and <-_existance><+_existence>. <#/>Procreation is the means by which the community continues to exist and thrive, affording its immortality.
\par <#/>It is educational because it is a forum for impacting /imparting cultural values and fostering attitudes. <#/>The initiate is taught to think with the community and see the world as it sees it.
\par <#/>She is given a cultural framework or "gramma'', a configuration of images and meaning within which to confront <-_experince><+_experience}{\fs22 >}{\fs24 
. <#/>It is as Shorter (1989;5) says; a form of "<-_experince><+_experience> teaching /learning that conforms to the best theories of pupil centred or life-centred education today;.
\par <#/>The girl to be initiated is remi
nded about proper manners of behaving as a girl of her rank, the motherly qualities of a raising a family, a love of her <-_hasband><+_husband> and in-laws, prudence in her decision, hospitality to strangers and duty to the poor. <#/>Cognolo C. (1933;85) 
quotes in emphasis; 
\par In the last few days preceding the circumcision, the boys and girls are prepared by a course of instruction, directed by a master chosen from among the old men.
\par <#/>This duty is only entrusted to a wise old man, learned in local customs
 and the love of the tribe, who, assisted by his wife explains to the candidates the rites of conduct and behaviour becoming to a circumcised person and the importance of maintaining the prestige of their sex He aims at impressing deeply in their minds th
e fact that their years of childhood have now come to an end and that they must begin a new life, nor must they show <-_themself><+_themselves> degenerate of their forebears.
\par <#/>It should be noted however that this type of education is gradual and <-_exper
ential><+_experiential>, not simply conceptual. <#/>It informs the initiates, forms her attitude and transforms him from earlier inferior status to a higher one; from childhood to mutuarity. <#/><quote_>}{\fs24 <X_>}{\v\fs24

 as observed by Khamelwa (1990;30) However, significant, clitoridectomy or female circumcision is a controversial issue as discussed in the next sub-topic.

\par <h> <#/> CLITORIDECTOMY AS A CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE; </h>
\par 
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {
<#/>Clitoridectomy is the cutting of some portions of the female genitals normally the clitoris or lobial minora or majora. <#/>This customary practice widely practised among people of Sudan, Ethiopia, Somali, Djibouti, Mali, Senegal and part o
f Egypt, Nigeria and East Africa, has been attacked by a number of European urgencies; missionaries, sentimental pro-Africa, <-_Goverment><+_Government> Educational and medical authorities. <#/>It is a controversial issue which actually dates back to 1929
 when the late Jomo Kenyatta in his book, Facing Mount Kenya (1978; 30-31) noted about missionaries who tried to militantly discourage the practice; 
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang2057 {\fs24 
\par <#/>...after several attempts to break down the custom, the church of <-_scotland><+-Scotland> mission to 
Kikuyu issued an order demanding that all their followers and those who wish their children to attend school should pledge themselves that they should in any adhere to or support this custom, and that they will not let their children undergo initiation ri
tes.
\par <#/>Similarly in 1930 the question of the custom of clitoridectomy was raised in the house of commons and a committee of members of parliament was appointed to investigate the matter. <#/>These reached an agreement that education other than force of en
actment gave freedom to individual persons to choose what custom was best suited to their changing conditions.(Ibid).
\par <#/>Again in 1931, a conference on <-_african><+_African> children was held in Geneva where it was argued against this "barbarous custom''
 which ought to be abolished by law, making it a criminal <-_offense><+_offence> for anyone who should be found guilty of <-_practicing><+_practising> the custom of clitoridectomy (Ibid.?) 
\par An American's Times correspondent Reena Shah (1939) in the article 'Female circumcision' holds that <quote_>}{\fs24 <X_> }{\v\fs24 
''campaigns by women groups, an international outcry and a 1982, August 12, ban have dampened the rigour with which female circumcision is practised...'}{\fs24 '</X><quote/>
\par 
\par <h> <#/>COUNTER ARGUMENTS TO SPEARHEAD ERADICATION </h>
\par 
\par <#/>Clitoridectomy rarely marks sexual maturity where we actually see the process done on infants or children rather than adolescents. <#/>Early circumcision may be, as commented on by Eliade et all (1987). (op.cit.) as a mark of ethnicity, or it may
 be considered hygienic or aesthetically attractive but it does not provide a means by which trauma may be harnessed to the inculcation of moral and metaphysical values, as a test of bravery. <#/>However, in societies where circumcision serve as a rite of
 passage to adulthood, is prevalent in central Australia and East Africa.
\par <#/>Women are afforded no comparable process to what and despite any physical operation, remain minor subordination to men, according to the norm that govern social organisation. <#/>
The inferior position of women in the society has culminated into popular <-_feministics><+_feminist> movements labelled as "Women's liberation movement''. <#/>It is their radical effort to come out of that. <#/>We can therefore see that actually the inte
ntion of clitoridectomy as a process defeats its purpose of adulthood, freedom, independence and general social status for women.
\par <#/>Clitoridectomy as a forum for impacting cultural values is not strong enough a point nor an ideal reason for it practice in
 that, from the societal setting, the time schedule for oral literature is usually at night whenever everybody else is done with his/her responsibility, and are seated by the fire place sharing casual talk. <#/>Sometimes in various casual activities/funct
ion like at beer places, field work like farming and harvesting, building houses, and <-/infact> also through a process of imitation where the young ones imitate what the elders do.
\par <#/>I therefore refute this argument as not being solid enough, since there
 are many other occasion where knowledge can be impacted to learners. <#/>It is even more evident with the emergence of school, colleges and institutions spearheading rapid advance in technology and civilisation.
\par <#/>There is the shift from tradition to modernity.
\par <#/>Cultural identity according to me can always be manifested through other ways like naming typical to the society heritage, <-_tatto><+_tattoo> decorations with minimum pain, dressing habits, language, <-_ethnics><+_ethnic> and geographical loc
ation. <#/>The eradication of clitoridectomy will definitely, not interfere with cultural identity.

\par <#/>Looking at East African with specific reference to Kenya's pluralistic nature of society, we see that contact can never be avoided among the different groups of people; the Europeans,I ndians, Arabs and Africans.
\par <#/>Detribalisation can be brought about as a consequence of intermarriage with uncircumcised persons. <#/>This is viewed with severe hostility particularly from Kikuyu parents for instance, who
 eventually <-_succed<<+_succeed> in breaking up marriage relationship or reject their sons and daughters who have refused to comply to tradition. <#/>This parental attitude has had deep psychological bearing on couples, bred widespread disobedience and h
e
ad strength in the "rebellious'' youth, and general misunderstanding among families. <#/>Because of this, the family which is a cell of a nation projects and hampers the peace of the entire nation. <#/>Clitoridectomy should therefore be eradicated so that
 
there can be free intermarriage, communal living as children of one family, the chosen community of God. <#/>Segregation has always emanated from the practice whereby those who have not been initiated are regarded with contempt as inferiors and social out
casts. <#/>History holds that the late Oginga Odinga, although he ruled remained a child; implying that he had not the mandate to rule. <#/><-/Infact> Mbiti j .(1969; 30) says in Nandis society; <quote_>}{\fs24 <X_> }{\v\fs24 
"Women who have not been initiated are considered to be 'children' }{\fs24 <#/>}{\v\fs24 Their offspring are known as 'children of children'."}{\fs24 </X>
<quote/> <#/>This implying that a person is incomplete and a nobody. <#/>It can be noted then that the practice instead of facilitating social relationship is a vehicle for social discrimination.
\par <#/>According to the Nandi female initiation rites, social inferiority and psychological depression may haunt the girl's life for a long time. <#/>This is because in the process prior to the operation, distinction is made between virgins who are 
operated upon while they sit on stools and the non-virgins operated upon while sited on the ground. <#/>He observes that <quote_>}{\v\fs24 
"the spectators rush away quickly to spread the news of who among the girls have been cowards or who have been virgins or otherwise."}{\fs24 
<quote/> [Ibid.] <#/>He further continues to say that if the girl is reported to be a coward, or not a virgin, the parents and brothers are so ashamed that they threaten to kill themselves or the girl concerned. <#/>We can therefore see that this pra
ctice does destabilise and threaten the emotional imbalance, unity and peace of the family and society.
\par <#/>Mbiti [l975:97] acknowledges the fact that blood s lost, the operation is very painful, since no pain relieving herbs or other anaesthesia is used. 
<#/>In Ngugi wa Thiong'o's 'The River Between', [l965:56] Muthoni actually died from wound infection. <#/>The brutality in which clitoridectomy is practised is climaxed in an article on female circumcision by a Times Corespondent Reena Shah, where he expl
icitly narrates the process for the Somali woman: 
\par 
\par <quote_>}{\fs24 <X_>}{\v\fs24 "like the Somali ...all the external genitals (clitoris, labia minora and labia majora) are scrapped out with an unsterilised blade and no anaesthesia is the process known as infabulation. }{\fs24 <#/>}{\v\fs24 The 
bleeding is stanched with herbs and the lips of the vulva are sealed together with the gum of a tree and acacia thorns. }{\fs24 <#/>}{\v\fs24 
A small hole is left for urine and menstrual blood... the wound closes to form a natural barrier against sex until it is torn open by her husband on their wedding night. }{\fs24 <#/>}{\v\fs24 
This is the time that a woman is fainting with her blood around her..." }{\fs24 </X><quote/> Reena [l993:Op.cit].
\par 
\par <#/><-/Infact> this mutilation leaves one breathless. <#/>Although the significance is greatly upheld, the phys
ical delicacy should not be dispensed with. <#/>In the same article, report from the health officer from a local government clinic estimates that three out of ten in his area die of heavy bleeding and torn uteruses during childbirth. <#/>Some become infer
tile or incontinent and are divorced by their husbands. <#/>He further notes that the biggest causes of death among young girls is sceptic wounds from clitoridectomy.
\par 
\par <#/>This bring us to the question of human Rights. <#/>As pointed out by Charles J. Mctad
dan, O.S.A, Ph.D (1967;271) that clitoridectomy is a violation of the principle of totality whereby man has the duty towards the preservation of his life, although moral obligation do not stop at the border line of barely maintaining life within the body.
 
<#/>He urges that, much as disease, accident and age will disfigure man, his duty rests upon him as the divinely appointed custodian of his body, to preserve the function integrity of his creation. <#/>To sum up this principle, St. Thomas and other theolo
gians, the encyclical of the popes (ibid) argues in respect of body preservation and acknowledgement of human right to its wholesomeness, <quote_>}{\fs24 <X_> }{\v\fs24 "... the whole is more important than the part''}{\fs24 </X>
<quote/> but is also moral to get rid of the body where the life is threatened. <#/>Such cases apply to surgical operation on diseased regions and the life. <#/><quote_>}{\fs24 <X_>}{\v\fs24 
"It is clear then, that, since their differentiation into a perfect unity has no other purpose than the good of the entire physical organism, each of 
the organs and members can be sacrificed if it places the whole in a danger that cannot otherwise be averted''}{\fs24 </X><quote/>, observed Pope Pius XII in his address to the Roman Guild of saint Luke; Charles J. (1967: 272).
\par <#/>Similarly on October, 1953, Pope Piu
s XII in the same text, Once again gave expressions to the principle of the totally of the human body in his address to the sixteenth international congress of military, the individual himself, has the right to dispose of his person, the integrity of his 
body, individual organs and their capacity to function, only to the extend that the general well being of the whole organism demand it''. (lbid:273).
\par <#/>From these argument then, the girls has the right of preservation of her body, right to sexual satisfaction, otherwise it endangers the whole body.
\par }{\fs24 <X_>}{\v\fs24 <#/>In an article by Kahiga in the Sunday Nation, March 27, 1994, by Kahiga, M. sums the <?/> laments the propensity girls have taken about circumcision while opening them to }{\v\fs22 haemorrhage}{\v\fs24 , urine retention, painfu
