\par <#/>This paper attempts to understand and interpret the current political changes in Kenya. <#/>In doing so, it constructs a theory that could assist in the explanation of these changes. <#/>In this effort, the paper traces the liberal theory of the State
 out }{\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_of> }{\fs24\lang2057 
which it extracts the concepts of negative liberty and positive liberty. <#/>It then becomes clear that negative liberty has to do with the defining of the limits of State power and the zoning, as it were, of the independence of the individual. 
<#/>It turns out to be an exercise in the vindication of the rights of man and the rights of the citizen. <#/>To this effect, the paper states that negative liberty, was and still is a basic constitutional principle of the modern State.
\par <#/>On the other ha
nd, the paper points out that positive liberty is closely linked to the notion of democracy, or popular sovereignty. <#/>The concept of positive liberty, the paper concludes, consists in the people having a say in all decisions that affect them. <#/>Posit
ive liberty is not content with limited government, it seeks to know who is governing and how he is governing.
\par <#/>The paper then straddles Kenya's constitutional experience across the two concepts (an exercise that brings out the graphic details in the con
tradictions between Chapter V of the Kenyan constitution and the Preservation of Public Security Act) and concludes that the current need for change emerges from the readiness to redefine the limits of State power (negative liberty) through democracy (pos
itive liberty).
\par <#/>Kenya is at a constitutional crossroads. <#/>With laws that have been conspicuously tilted in favour of State power, there is now a fierce need to reverse the situation and transfer 'power to the people'. <#/>The repeal of Section 2A of 
the Kenyan Constitution, no doubt, heralded this new-found public thirst for more fundamental changes in the Kenyan laws. <#/>The rationale for state-oriented laws and constitution in Kenya is not difficult to find for two reasons, namely: a)the leadershi
p's concept of liberty; and, b) pre-occupation with the element of peace and security.
\par <#/>It can be argued that the Kenyan leadership is still by far, what could be described as 'first generation' leadership. <#/>Those in it owe their origin, or their plac
e in politics, at least for those in the top hierarchy, to the struggle for independence. <#/>In this sense, the political mind of this generation can be said to be closely attuned with that of Hobbes and Machiavelli. <#/>For them, like Hobbes, the 'liber
t
y of the commonwealth' consists, as we know, in its independence. <#/>Machiavelli too, when speaking of political liberty (<foreign/>Vivere <foreign/>libero, <foreign/>stato <foreign/>libero), seems to have this meaning especially in mind. <#/>Liberty was
 
to him primarily the absence of foreign rule, and only secondarily opposition to tyranny. <#/>The rule of his 'new prince' was justified in so far as it succeeded in establishing a strong government, not in restoring a kind of liberty which he considered 
no longer possible, at any rate in Italy, in view of the prevailing corruption of political life.
\par <#/>Thus the ideology which presided over the 'new principality' seems very far from being one of a 'liberal' type. <#/>Yet it is <-/worth while> pausing for a
 moment's reflection before accepting this judgement as final. <#/>It can in fact be asked whether the very demand for a strong state, for a firm foundation of law and order, which is so evident in both Machiavelli and Hobbes and which alone would suffice
 to explain the rise and success of absolute monarchy in Europe, was not in itself, notwithstanding every appearance to the contrary, a demand for a liberty of sorts.
\par <#/>Take the famous sentence at the beginning of chapter xvii of }{\fs24\ul\lang2057 The Prince}{\fs24\lang2057 , one of the mo
st outspoken, and perhaps one of the most terrifying, passages in Machiavelli: 'Caesar Borgia was reputed cruel; nevertheless, the cruelty of his repaired the Romagna, united it, and restored it to allegiance and peace.' Consider what are the benefits, th
e
 goods, the attainment of which justifies the merciless action of the new prince in Machiavelli's eyes: union, allegiance, peace. <#/>These are values closely similar to those which Hobbes invokes in order to prove the need to <-/foresake> the state of na
ture and to enter the 'civil state'.
\par <#/>Indeed, nothing is more revealing than the list Hobbes draws up of all the good things that are missed in the state of nature, with the clear implication that they can be purchased by putting an end to that state, i.
e. by setting up a 'common power', a State.
\par <#/>'In such condition (he writes in one of the best-known and most impressive passages of Leviathan), there is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no culture of the ea
rth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no instrument of moving, and removing, such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; n
o society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short'.
\par <#/>Here, as in a photographic negative, we get a clear picture of what are the values, the benefits which, accor
ding to Hobbes, are attained in the state. <#/>These values are both material and spiritual: they concern the comforts of life as well as the improvement of the mind. <#/>They are what in modern terms we should call 'cultural values'; and cultural values 
are always, in some way or other, associated with liberty, with the free display of human initiative and energy.
\par <#/>On the basis of the foregoing analysis of Machiavelli and Hobbes regarding the theory of the State, what justification can be advanced for comparison their mentality and that of the first generation of leaders in Kenya?
\par <#/>True, neither Machiavelli's nor Hobbe's State has much in common with the modern, 'liberal' State. <#/>The 'prince' of the one, the 'sovereign' of the other, know no brakes
 to their power. <#/>If freedom simply means independence, they alone are 'free', because their power is limited only by force and their will is the supreme law. <#/>Yet, the entrenched belief in Kenya that the country's Chief Executive is above the law, 
a
lthough not stipulated in the constitution, has over the years helped in mystifying the powers of the Chief Executive to the point of resembling the 'prince' and the 'sovereign'. <#/>Matters do not end there! The belief that the Chief Executive is above t
h
e law could be explained by the leadership's pre-occupation with peace and security. <#/>The Public Order Act and related laws that jealously guard the State through various explanations of state security have had a <-/cummulative> psychological effect on
 
the people and the head of state on the concept of state power and those who wield it. <#/>To the people, the head of state is the state personified. <#/>The incarnation of the state. <#/>Granted this position, the head of state has seen no reason to equa
te his personal security to that of the state resulting in tyranny.
\par <#/>Nevertheless, if the purpose of power is to guarantee peace and security, the all-embracing action of law must come to a halt at a certain point, if only to allow the enjoyment of all t
hose goods which are the fruit of peace and security. <#/>The justification of law and order lies precisely here. <#/>Thanks to them, those obstacles are removed which would otherwise prevent that enjoyment if peace and security vanished.
\par <#/>The spirit of the Kenyan law seems to subscribe to this notion of liberty, compelled to do so by its bias for State security. <#/>Yet, this </OM> a wholly negative approach to the concept of liberty. <#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 <quote_><X_>}{
\v\fs24\lang2057 'The liberty of a subject', says Hobbes, 'lieth... only in those things which in regulating their actions, the sovereign hath praetermitted.'}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 <quote/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
 In other words, citizens are free only in that sphere which is not regulated by law: <foreign/>legis, <foreign/>libertas <foreign/>civium. <#/>Let us, then, give t
his liberty its proper name. <#/>Let us call it 'negative liberty' as Alexander d'Entreves does. <#/>But we do so on condition that in this respect we number even Hobbes among 'liberal' authors. <#/>For indeed the greatest philosopher of Absolutism seems 
t
o take a fairly generous view of what is or should be the liberty of the subject, if it includes 'the liberty to buy, and sell, and otherwise contract with one another; to choose their own abode, their own diet, their own trade of life, and institute thei
r children as they themselves think fit; and the like'.
\par <#/>Thus, when from the origin of power we turn to considering its exercise, negative liberty appears as the first and perhaps the most significant justification of the modern state. <#/>Under that hea
ding we can begin by listing both the removal of obstacles and the assurance of a sphere of individual independence described by Hobbes himself as the task of the State. <#/>But evidently that liberty could not be held to be secure or complete until a thi
rd condition was fulfilled, until the line was firmly drawn where power must be brought to a halt, until in one word, the limits of state action were definitely established.
\par <#/>It seems almost paradoxical that here once again it is Hobbes who points the wa
y. <#/>He does so by pointing out that laws should be good laws. <#/>He points out that only such laws are to be approved which do not impose useless restrictions or burdens. }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <#/><quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
'For the use of laws... is not to bind the people from all voluntary 
actions; but to direct and keep them in such a motion, as not to hurt themselves by their own impetuous desires, or indiscretion; as hedges are set, not to stop travellers, but to keep them in their way.}{\fs24\lang2057 '</X>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 <quote/>}{
\fs24\lang2057 
\par <#/>The analogy between laws and hedges is 
revealing. <#/>'Good laws' are only those which are indispensable for securing men's peaceful co-existence. <#/>They should act as boundaries to that sphere which is reserved for the decisions of individuals alone. <#/>Once again we are confronted with th
e
 concept of negative liberty; but this time that concept is used as a legal standard, as a measure of the limits which the State should not overstep; though, <-/ofcource> from Hobbe's standpoint, there is nothing to prevent it from doing so. <#/>It is fas
cinating to find the same taken up by Locke. <#/>For laws to act as hedges is to him their greatest merit and their proper task. <#/>Indeed, it is precisely by doing so that laws, contrary to Hobbe's opinion, are the condition of liberty, since }{
\b\fs24\lang2057 <quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 'tha
t ill deserves the name of confinement which hedges us in from bogs and precipices. <#/>So that however it may be mistaken, the end of law, is not to abolish or restrain but to preserve and enlarge freedom... <#/>For liberty is to be free from restraint a
nd violence from others; which cannot be where there is no law.'}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 <quote/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <#/>Locke, of course, was and still is the chief philosopher of negative liberty. <#/>As a complete formulation of the liberal conception of the State, the }{\fs24\ul\lang2057 Second Treatise of Government}{\fs24\lang2057 
 has probably been equalled only by another classic, John Stuart Mill's essay entitled,}{\fs24\ul\lang2057  On Liberty}{\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>Mill discusses in more up-to-date language the problem of the defence of the individual against the pressure of social forces unknown in Locke's day. <
#/>But both writers, like all others who share the same liberal inspiration, are concerned to secure that sphere of individual independence which Hobbes, and many 'absolutist' writers after him, regarded as a gracious gift from the sovereign. <#/>No doubt
 the principles to which they refer in defining the duties and powers and limits of State action are widely different.
\par <#/>Locke turns to the law of nature and of reason, which precedes the State, and to the natural rights of man, which are inalienable and 
<-/imprescriptible>. <#/>Mill appeals to the principle of utility, 'utility in the largest sense, grounded on the permanent interests of a man as a progressive being.'}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 
Further, in defining the ends to be secured the emphasis is different.
\par <#/>To Locke the 
reason for the existence of the State, or to use his own words, the reason why men join together in the social compact, is the 'preservation of their lives, liberties and estates', the three basic goods which he sums up in one 'general name, property'. <#
/>Mill on the other hand, draws up a long list of liberties which society must respect, but then he too sums them all up in a single sentence: }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
'the only freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts to obtain it.'}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <quote/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 What matters is that in both cases the <-/}{\fs24\lang2057 legitimation> of power is linked to an essentially negative concept of liberty. }{\v\fs24\lang2057 <#/>The purpose and at the same time the li
mits of State action are determined by the one and only value which must be established and secured; the free and unhampered development of the individual.
\par <#/>It would therefore seem logical at this point to conclude that the concept of negative liberty a
nd the liberal conception of the State founded upon it are nothing but the product of a particular historical period and must be judged and valued as such. <#/>This is precisely what we often hear said when Liberalism is depicted as the typical expression
 
of an age which saw the establishment of a social structure where unfettered individualism appeared to be the highest possible good. <#/>There is certainly much truth in this contention. <#/>There is no denying that the success of Locke's teaching corresp
o
nded historically with the rise of commercial middle classes and the 'possessive individualism' which they professed, just as Mill's popularity was closely associated with the final triumph of laissez-faire and the bourgeois way of life. <#/>But since cal
l
ing Liberalism a 'bourgeois ideology' often conceals a polemical or even a hostile attitude, it might as well to face the question in its most general terms, and to ask whether the fact that a given political theory was linked with a particular set of his
torical circumstances is sufficient ground for doubting its merits and its validity in a changing and more complex world.
\par <#/>Before even trying to answer this question properly, there is one remark which can and must be made concerning the }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/}{\v\fs24\lang2057 bougeois> cha
racter of negative liberty and of the liberal conception of the State. <#/>If this is a 'bourgeois ideology', it is certainly very different, both in its assumptions and in its implications, from that other and in many ways opposite theory - also }{
\fs24\lang2057 <-/}{\v\fs24\lang2057 discribed> as bourgeois - of the governing }{\fs24\lang2057 <-_}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
elites><+_elite>. <#/>Unlike modern elitism, classical Liberalism was tied, both logically and historically, to the principle of human equality. <#/>It claimed for every individual an equal share in the rights of man
. <#/>Far from expressing a reactionary, or even a conservative, attitude towards the existing social structure, it was an instrument of progress, indeed even of subversion of that structure, of the privileges and discriminations which that structure enta
iled.
\par <#/>This, however, is not the only merit of the liberal theory of the State. <#/>Its greatest achievement was that of having created its own instruments and institutions, which still constitute the firm foundation of the modern State. <#/>These instit
utions have weathered many storms, showing that they can be adapted to the needs of a changed society. <#/>They seem indeed to have drawn fresh vigour and inspiration }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
frommthe> very criticism to which they have been faced in recent years. <#/>When examining those institutions from a legal angle it has been pointed out that they were the result both of historical development and of a deliberate commitment and choice.

\par <#/>Now the men who made this choice made it in the clearest possible manner, by means of
 those solemn 'Declarations' with which it became and remains customary to preface constitutional charters. <#/>They laid down the values they considered essential for the }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
legitimation> of power, in the form of vindication of 'rights'. <#/>But those rig
hts were, for the most part, negative liberties. <#/>They were nothing else than limits appended to the action of the State. <#/>They had been conceived of long before the rise of the bourgeois society, long before even the rise of the modern State.

\par <#/>Th
is, then, is the important point to be kept in mind when discussing the political theory of Liberalism: that the notion of negative liberty was the exclusive product of neither abstract theory nor of social conditions of comparatively recent date. <#/>The
 
'rights of Englishmen', which were to be an inspiration of, and a model for so many Declarations of Rights in different countries, have a long history behind them: they were historic before becoming 'natural' rights. <#/>They were won in age-long struggle
s and set down in famous documents, of which Magna Carta is only the first in time. <#/>The English Declarations of Rights in the }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
seventeeth> century have no abstract or universal character. <#/>On the contrary, the emphasis is on precedent, on the fact 
that such rights already existed and were sanctioned in the past, and that it was only a matter of re-affirming them solemnly and of providing adequate instruments for their defence.
\par <#/>It took the American Revolution to convert these historic rights into
 natural rights. <#/>Undoubtedly the new spiritual climate and the rationalistic construction of the State which had found expression in Locke's writings had a share in this transformation. <#/>But an equal share was taken by the <-/
rwquirements> of the po
litical struggle. <#/>This no longer allowed the colonists, once they had declared themselves detached from the mother country, to invoke the 'rights of Englishmen', and thus led them almost necessarily to claim these rights on general grounds as 'rights 
of man'.

The great Declaration of the French National Assembly of 1789 purported to define both the rights of man and those of the citizen; but no sooner had the storm of revolution settled, than the same rights reappeared as historic or positive rights

\par <#/>More women have entered the job market than ever before. <#/>With the current socio-economic changes and with more women attaining education, the number of working women is goin

 been associated with poor child development. <#/>The effect of the current child-rearing practices has not been questioned in our society. <#/>Its effects should be a major concern not only to the parents but also to the employers, educators and the soci
e
ty at large if children are expected to grow normally. <#/>Erikson's stages of Psychological and cognitive development have been used as a yard stick to illustrate the effect of the current child-rearing in Kenya. <#/>A few suggestions to improve child-re

\par }{\i\fs24\lang2057 <h> <#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 Child Rearing in African Traditional Society </h>
\par <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Child rearing in Kenya was <-/traditionaly> a responsibility of the mother, grandmother and other members of the extended family. <#/>Durojaiye (1976) ob
served that a traditional African child was born into a family where it was completely accepted regardless of the prevailing economic and domestic strains in the family at the time of the child's arrival. <#/>In the first two years of life, the child was 
a
lmost in the company of the mother-experiencing her affection, a sense of belonging and having all his needs constantly met. <#/>As the child grew, it received informal education from the mother, other members of the extended family and also from the soci
e
ty. <#/>Those people were friendly, patient and never too busy for the child's needs. <#/>The values of the society were passed to the child by family members and they also socialized the child along the lines accepted by the society. <#/>As a result, the
 child grew trusting the world around him, becoming industrious and gaining confidence in herself or himself as he matured and approached independence from parents. 
\par <#/>With the rapid socio-economic changes pushing the majority of women into the work-force
, the traditional child-rearing practices and the warm relationship between the child, the mother and the other members of the extended family are disappearing rather too fast. <#/>While it would be easier to argue that women would be better parents if th
ey remain at home and take care of their children, it is important to understand why in today's society an increasing number of women have to work outside their homes.
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 Woman as a Worker and a Parent </h>
\par <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The option of working outside the home or
 not is a luxury that many Kenyan women cannot afford. <#/>Very few of them have the pleasure of deciding to work or not to work. <#/>Cochran and Bronfenbrenner (1979) outline three reasons why women work: (1) To provide through earned income some degree 
o
f independence for themselves and their families. <#/>(2) Working outside the home often brings with it regular and frequent social contact with workmates who may become friends and source of information. <#/>(3) Some people receive a great deal of intrin
sic satisfaction from their jobs.
\par <#/>Together with the above reasons, an increasing number of women in Kenya are being educated and trained for various jobs. <#/>As a results, more women are interested in <-/persuing> a career. <#/>However, Morris and Mill
er (1980) <-/refering to> a recent study indicated that income remains the primary and overriding factor leading women to enter the job market. <#/>With consumer price index riding high and the real earnings adjusted for inflation going down, most women i
n Kenya have to work to supplement their husbands' earnings, and to improve the family purchasing power. <#/>Single mothers who are very many in this country have to work to provide sole financial support for their families.
\par <#/>Most of the working women ar
e of child-bearing age and they have pre-school and school children. <#/>Considering the economic realities of raising the children which cannot easily be met by a single salary, women feel they should work to bring some income home. <#/>At the midst of t
h
e family responsibilities, many women have to struggle to keep a job no matter how intolerable in order to remain financially independent. <#/>Because of the pressing needs for more family income, some women entering the job market are forced to take more

<#/>Regardless of why women work, Morris and Miller (1980) observed that, the shift of their role has brought many changes in how children are reared, how marriages work and how women see themselves in the society. <#/>While they have to work, it is also

sitting. <#/>As a result, some children are left by themselves, others are taken to day-care <AmE/>centers but }{\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 article}{\v\fs24\lang2057 > }{\fs24\lang2057

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Though this child-rearing practice seems to be inevitable in our society, the effects it may have on the child himself, the family and t
he society at large has not been questioned in our society. <#/>The effect of this pattern of upbringing were expressed by Erik Erikson in his description of stages of psychological and cognitive development of a child }{\v\fs24\lang2057 
(Biehler & Snowman 1982)}{\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>The stages are used in the paper as a yardstick to explain the situation relevant to child-rearing in Kenya today.
\par <#/>The first stage of development is from birth to one year. <#/>At this stage Erikson says the child learns to trust or mistrust the world around him. <#/>"Trust is fostered by consistency, continuity, and sameness of experience"}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 (p. 37)}{\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>The three elements mentioned above are lacking in today's pattern of child-rearing in Kenya. <#/>The mother usually goes back to work after about two months of
 maternity leave, leaving the baby under the care of the house-maid. <#/>Besides taking care of the baby, the house-maid is also responsible for other household chores including washing, cooking and general cleaning to mention a few. <#/>The maid has no e
x
perience in child-rearing whatsoever. <#/>Given the amount of work in the house, the maid's inexperience, and her age, attending the baby's needs may not be a priority except when inevitable and in many cases the maid may mishandle the baby. <#/>In the pr
o
cess the mother may notice the negligence and replace the housemaid, or the housemaid may run away in frustration. <#/>Before the end of this first stage, the mother may employ more than one housemaid, each one of them coming with different approach in ch
i
ld-rearing depending on her background and personality. <#/>The frequent changes of the housemaids means rapid changes in the way children are handled. <#/>The mother is also away from the baby most of the times and when she is home, the way she handles t
he baby is also different from the way the maid does. <#/>As a result of this inconsistency, the child learns to mistrust his environment.
\par <#/>The second stage is between 2\emdash 3 years. <#/>After the child learns either to trust or mistrust his environment, Eri
kson suggested that the child should be encouraged to do what he is able to do for himself at his own pace but with supervision. <#/>By so doing, he will develop a sense of autonomy. <#/>If people are impatient with him and tend to do most of the things f
o
r him, he learns to doubt his ability to deal with his environment and hence develop a sense of shame and doubt. <#/>Contrary to Erikson's view and that of the African tradition that a child should be patiently guided in learning to do some tasks for hims
e
lf, today's society is in a hurry to finish one task and move to the next and they cannot stand children on their way. <#/>Neither the mother nor the mother substitute is patient enough even to let a child feed himself in case he messes up his clothes. <#
/
>Besides, the maid has to do so much and wants to finish the tasks before her master comes home. <#/>In some cases, the mother sets a day's routine for the baby and the maid is expected to adhere to it. <#/>This gives the child no time to learn and do thi
n
gs for himself. <#/>This approach makes a child develop a sense of shame and doubt that he can hardly do even the simple things for himself. <#/>That is why most of them have to be fed, dressed and washed even when they are of school age. <#/>This is very
 common in most of the urban homes where there are housemaids.
\par <#/>The third stage is between 4-5 years of age. <#/>According to Erikson, a child at this age needs to explore and experiment with his environment. <#/>If this is allowed and if all his questio
ns are answered as he explores and experiments with their environment, there is a tendency for the child to become initiative. <#/>But if he }{\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_is> }{\fs24\lang2057 
restricted and made to feel his questions and activities are a nuisance, he develops a sense of guilt and <-_become><+_becomes> afraid of doing things by himself.
\par <#/>Due to lack of enough space-especially in urban areas and with the fact that the mother wants her house to remain <-/sportless> clean, some children are inhibited from exploring and experimenting w
ith their surroundings. <#/>Some children are even beaten if they are found handling things they are not supposed to. <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
<#/>Due to lack of finance or even knowledge that children need toys and play materials to aid them in development, some parents are not i
n a position to make or buy these important tools of development for the children. <#/>On the other hand, the maids might be too busy to attend to the child's questions. <#/>Sometimes she may not have enough knowledge to handle some of the questions asked
 by the child tactfully. <#/>At other times, she may give misleading answers which might be harmful to the child's development. <#/>This kind of experience inhibit the child's initiative and hence hinder proper development.
\par }\pard\plain \s17\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \v\lang2057 {<#/>Stage four is between age 6 -
 11 years when a child is entering school and dominated by intellectual curiosity. <#/>Erikson's view is that a child at this stage wants to be recognized and praised for his accomplishments. <#/>If this is done, a child becomes industrious. <#/>If not, h
e
 feels inadequate and inferior. <#/>Most of the tasks that a child does at this stage relates to what he learns in school. <#/>To facilitate learning, he needs support and encouragement both in school and at home. <#/>The maid who is with him is too busy 
most of the time and may also be disinterested in child affairs. <#/>Besides, she may be illiterate and therefore not able to assist children in their intellectual matters. <#/>To support this inadequacy, Durojaiye (1976) remarked that }{\b <quote_>}{
"The employment of housemaids to look after the children of educated urban dwellers may bring other educational problems" (P. 21)}{\b <quote/>}{. <#/><-/Refering> to Roger Bastide, Durojaiye further wrote: }{\b <quote_>}{
The effect may be that, the children of these educated elite m

After a long day's work, the mother is also tired and prone to emotional difficulties due to exhaustion. <#/>Instead of coming home to attend to the child and compensate him for what he missed from the mother substitute, she may prefer to keep to 
herself or to <-/catchup> with the remaining household chores without the child's interference. <#/>Sometimes the child is not encouraged to do the homework or he struggles alone without mother's or maid's assistance. <#/>As a result, his psychological an
d educational needs are not met either by the mother or the mother substitute.
\par <#/>The fifth and the last stage in child development according to Erikson is between 12-18 years of age. <#/>Erikson's view is that the child is approaching independence from pa
rents. <#/>His concern at this stage is what kind of a person he is becoming. <#/>If the earlier stages of development were adequately taken care of and if the child succeeds (as reflected by the reaction of the others), self identity develops. <#/>If the
 
child is unable to establish a sense of stability in various aspects of his life, Erikson said that the danger is role confusion particularly about sexual and occupational identity. <#/>This means a child grows to adulthood before he is well adjusted both
 
to his environment and within himself. <#/>This is at a stage where some children get confused in life and deviate from society norms. <#/>The child may involve himself in bad company, starts taking alcohol and drugs and get involved in bad sexual behavio
u
r. <#/>This is the time the child's behaviour starts worrying the people concerned but the source of his problems may be traced back to the earlier stages of development. <#/>Though there was no clear-cut established relationship between juvenile <-/deliq
uency> and mother's employment, Gordon (1979) observed that absenteeism in school, juvenile <-/deliquency>, alcoholism and drug usage among teenagers may be associated with lack of adequate child care and parental supervision in the early teens.
\par <#/>Though the issue and solution of child-rearing in Kenya today is not a simple subject to deal with because of its complexity, it should be a major concern to the parents, employers, educators and to all those who advocate for a better <-/tommorow> for
 
our Kenyan youth. <#/>It can be clearly seen from the above discussion that our society is faced with a danger whose consequences have not yet been clearly identified and which may be blamed on other things. <#/>Entering the job market by the Kenyan women
 
is being encouraged by the current socio-economic changes and by our education system and it is not expected to change. <#/>The model of a home with the male as the bread-winner and a housewife and children to support will soon become a minority situation
 
as more women join the labour market. <#/>The role of a housemaids, day-care <AmE/>centers, and other forms of child-rearing will therefore remain dominant in this country. <#/>It is important therefore to explore all possible compensatory measures that w
ould limit the possible ill-effects associated with the current upbringing of children to ensure advantageous and purposed child-rearing. <#/>A few suggestions in improving child-rearing in Kenya are given in the following paragraphs.
\par <#/>Most of the housemaids are either illiterate young girls or primary school dropouts who have no experience in child-rearing. <#/>They should therefore not be expected to do a mothering job efficiently without any training. <#/>It is there\-
fore important to train them in chi
ld-rearing practices before they assume child-rearing responsibilities; equip them with knowledge and skills, and also raise their morals, knowing that their role in the society is also recognized. <#/>The skills would also help them become better mothers
 in future and hence raise the standard of child-rearing in this country.
\par <#/>A day-care <AmE/>center is another alternative to child-rearing for working mothers. <#/>But many mothers are faced with a problem of finding a reliable day-care <AmE/>center even
 when they have the money. <#/>The <AmE/>programs in most day-care <AmE/>centers are designed to provide only physical needs of a child and to benefit the working mothers without considering the psychological and emotional interests of a children. <#/>Sta
f
f-children ratio and physical facilities are not usually adequate and this is not good for child development. <#/>Most of the caretakers are also untrained. <#/>To improve Day-Care <AmE/>Centers, employers, educators and society at large should consider C
h
ild Care matters to be of direct concern to them and help to influence national policies that will take care of this problem. <#/>This will include providing adequate Day-Cares <AmE/>Centers, either near the homes of the working mothers or near their area
s of work. <#/>Employers should also con\-
sider subsidizing child-care for their working mothers (on a sliding scale in relation to the family income) as one of the fringe benefits needed by both the mother and employer. <#/>This can also minimize the need for mothers to be ab\-
sent from work and hence improve productivity in their work. <#/>Employers should also plan to have lunch-time seminars for their women workers to help them balance their work and the family responsibilities. <#/>If employers are not ab
le to handle such seminars, they should invite resource people from the organizations concerned with child survival who would be willing to talk to the working mothers.
\par <#/>Even when housemaids and Day-Care <AmE/>Centers can take the responsibility of chil
d-rearing when mothers are at work, every child needs a special time with the parents. <#/>Mothers should plan to have a quantity time with their children everyday and much more over the weekends when they are not working. <#/>This will foster warm feelin
g
s between the mother and child. <#/>She should also take some time to teach skills to children when they are free. <#/>Due to the demand on her time and energy, a working mother should also plan to have a number of children she can care for without much s
train. }{\fs24\lang2057 </X>}{\v\fs24\lang2057

\par <#/>While Kenya's population growth is said to be unprecedented in history, it is true that there are no explicit effective and operational laws which at present could be
 relied on to put a check on this trend. <#/>There are laws on paper which could be said to be <-/spill overs> of colonial legacy but which lack the institutional and administrative infrastructure to operate in the most efficient way to curb the run away 
p
opulation growth. <#/>What could be said to be more effectively operational are the so called traditional laws which are still observed and respected in many societies in the country. <#/>However these tradition laws are less respected by the present majo
rity of the population, especially the youth under 20 years, who due to changing socio\_
economic conditionals consider such laws outdated and only applicable to the generation of their parents. <#/>This could be one of the reasons why adolescent fertility no
w contributes 30% to the overall fertility of the country. <#/>There are no efficient established infrastructure to effectively apply these laws on the youth.
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<#/>Thus, this gap between the traditional and the modern law is thoroughly exploited by the indi
viduals and society in general to increase population growth in the country. <#/>For example there is no law stating the number of children one should have, there is no law which says who should use contraception and there is no law as to the number of wi
v
es one should have. <#/>These decisions are left to the individuals and the degree of execution and obedience rests entirely with the couple. <#/>Even in case of abortion which is generally considered illegal unless mother's life is in danger, evidence ha
s it that apart from the medical personnel who do it privately, the traditional healers are doing even a more enterprising business due to low cost.
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang1031 {<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 This paper first gives a general overview of Kenya's demographic situation pointing out the major determ
inants of the population increase over the years. <#/>These include fertility, mortality and migration. <#/>Secondly, the paper looks at how these factors operate to sustain the rapid population growth within the existing laws in the country. <#/>In so do
i
ng the gaps in such laws are pointed out and emphasis put on how they tend to promote population growth. <#/>The last part of the paper attempts to outline some of the possible solution that could be accommodated within the existing system in an effort to
 slow down the present tempo of rapid population growth.
\par <h> <#/>II. }{\fs24\ul\lang2057 KENYA DEMOGRAPHIC SITUATION }{\fs24\lang2057 </h>
\par <#/>With an annual growth rate of approximately 3.6, Kenya is said to have one of the fastest growing populations in the world}{\v\fs24\lang2057  (UN 1985, CBS 1974, CBS 1984)}{\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>This rapid population growth has been attributed to both demographic socio-cultural as well as economic factors.
\par <#/>As already pointed out the demographic factors include fertility mortality and migration. <#/>These are actually influenced by the socio-cultural factors in determining the population size and structure.
\par <#/>The increase in population over the years based on the various censuses is given on }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>idiom}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 table I, along with the estimated growth rates,

 affected by biases in the data.
\par <#/>The substantiation of this growth of population over the years is also demonstrated by the figures in table 2 which shows the fertility and mortality indicators underlying the said population increase.

 this decline is that many more children are saved and added to the already booming population there by contributing to the observed growth.
\par <#/>Migration can be said to have played a minor role in contributing to the observed population growth since it is
 mainly internal. <#/>However its major effect has been redistributing population from the densely populated to the <-/law> populated areas. <#/>This however, has taken place within the existing law which at times has put restrictions to such movements re

\par <h> <#/>A. }{\fs24\ul\lang2057 FERTILITY }{\fs24\lang2057 </h>
\par <#/>Fertility process which involves reproduction takes place between two individuals. <#/>The decision to have or not have a child is made between the two individuals. <#/>There are no laws 
in the country which <-_says><+_say> couples should have such number of children. <#/>The decision to have one more child in Kenya has for <-/along> time and continues to be influenced by what we called traditional rules, norms or beliefs. <#/>The society

as an outcast, not fit to be part of that society. <#/>There are beliefs among many ethnic groups that one should have not only one two or three children but more because 
the children are needed to help in the provision of labour. <#/>One needs to have many children because when some die, one will still have enough to go on with. <#/>Many children are needed as a symbol of power in the society. <#/>Whoever, has many childr
en is looked upon with respect. <#/>One must have at least a male child who will help in the perpetuation of the family name.
\par <#/>These and many others are deep rooted beliefs and practices of the people. <#/>They are protected by what is called traditional
 laws and rules. <#/>The majority of Kenya's population still live in the rural areas where they curve out their daily life within this

\par <h> <#/>A. (i) }{\fs24\ul\lang2057 AGE AT MARRIAGE }{\fs24\lang2057 </h>
\par <#/>From demographic point of view, it has been shown that the age at marriage and age at birth are major determinants of fertility in any given population. <#/>This is because young age at marriage implies longer exposure to reproduct
ive period which in turn means higher number of children born compared to one who starts at 25 and has shorter period of reproduction.

and operate within the fabrics of the traditional laws and rules. <#/>For example it was against traditional rule for a man
 to have sex with the wife after giving birth until the child was three years. <#/>It was also against the rules for the wife to have sex with the husband when there was funeral or during harvest time. <#/>Some of these practices still operate among certa
in ethnic groups and help in the regulation of fertility.
\par <#/>As far as modern or artificial contraception is concerned, there are even less rules and controls then before. <#/>It was possible for <-/contraceptors> to get services from approved hospitals or
 centres during the colonial period. <#/>But with the transfer of the provision of contraceptive services to the ministry of health since 1967, there has been a breakdown in the control of supplies. <#/>The contraceptives are supplied free of charge in ho
s
pitals and can also be bought across the counter with no many questions being asked. <#/>There are no legal <-_limitation><+_limitations> on the use of contraceptives, who buys them and for what purpose. <#/>While there is a legal feeling on the side of t
h
e state that youth should not be given contraceptives, there is no way this can be affected. <#/>Many young people have multi-sources of getting the condom or the <-_pills><+_pill> for example. <#/>The majority of them use the condom not for <-/contracept

ies, the government should come up with an official standing on the issue thus making it legal for these youth to have access to these important services. <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 <#/>
However there is the Pharmacy and Poisons Act which the state can utilize to control the use of certain methods by these youth.
\par <#/>The use of contraceptives by the majority of the population though having no legal hitches has nevertheless had no impact on reducing fertility and therefore population growth. <#/>This is basically due to logistic problem
s i.e problems with supply to the rural areas, clinics where they are in high demand.

\par <#/>The Kenya government is very clear on the issue of abortion. <#/>It is clearly stated that it is an offence for any person, acting with int
ent to procure the miscarriage of a woman whether there is <grammar> or not with child, to unlawfully administer to her or other <-/noxing> thing, or use any other means whatever. <#/>It further states that it is an offence for any woman to take steps wit
h
 the intent to procure her own abortion. <#/>However abortion is allowed in cases where the operation is performed in good faith to save the life of the mother. <#/>However the phrase "Good faith save the mother" leaves a lot to be desired. <#/>Good faith
 very much depends on many factors. }{\fs24\lang2057 </X>}{\v\fs24\lang2057

\par <#/>Kenya, like many other third world countries has been under the grip of an economic crisis for almost two decades. <#/>
The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other donors have been of the strong view that these economic <-_crisis><+_crises> are a result of structural distortions in their economies. <#/>These financial and aid giving agencies have increa
s
ingly urged third world countries to adapt the structural adjustment programmes (SAPS). <#/>These programmes are aimed at making their economies more efficient by reducing budget deficits. <#/>This is either by raising taxes or by cutting down government 
expenditure.
\par <#/>Parastatals in Kenya are well known for their adverse effects and burden on the economy. <#/>They have been the cause of the worsening budgetary deficits. <#/>Many of them have never made profits since inception, they do not pay taxes, they
 frequently rely on the government to bail them out of financial difficulties and do not pay their debts which are often guaranteed by the government.
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<#/>In the 1990/91 financial year alone, the government had to pay KL57 million to service debts owned by
 parastatals while at the same time the parastatals owned the Treasury KL25 million in the form of unpaid taxes. <#/>Parastatals have also been accused of gross inefficiency, corruption and general mismanagement of resources.
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang1031 {<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 In light of the foregoing,
 privatisation of some of these parastatals has been prescribed as a panacea for improving their operating efficiency and <-/proftiability>. <#/>The financial and aid giving agencies have encouraged privatisation which is one of the programmes under the s
tructural adjustment programmes.
\par <#/>Kenya has already embarked on a privatisation exercise of some of the ailing parastatals. <#/>The government has designated some parastatals as strategic and others as non-strategic with the latter being scheduled for <-
/diverstiture> and the former for restructuring. <#/>However, the privatisation programme is eliciting reactions which suggest that adequate preparations have not been done to ensure effective implementation of the programme. <#/>It appears that due to th
e
 wave of privatisation currently sweeping the globe, Kenya like many other third world countries, is privatising <-/hurrdiedly> <-/with> considering that this might not necessarily work. <#/>Strategies concerning privatisation have to be worked out if the
 programme is to work.
\par <#/>In this paper, we examine the role of parastatals in the economy. <#/>The case for privatisation is then outlined after which we examine some of the legal issues that have arisen and those that are bound to arise in the process of
 privatising parastatals.
\par <h> <#/>}{\fs24\ul\lang2057 The Role of Parastatals in the Economy }{\fs24\lang2057 </h>}{\fs24\ul\lang2057 
\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>The term 'parastatal' is generally used to refer to those governmental organizations which fall outside the main lines of the departmental a
nd Ministerial <-/heirarchies> and which have in consequence, some measure of quasi-autonomy in their day to day activities.
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<#/>A better and clearer definition describes a parastatal as follows:
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang1031 {<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 "An institution, organization or agency which is wholly 
or mainly <-/finnanced> or owned and controlled by the Government. <#/>The criterion of such public enterprises would be ownership by the government of 50% or more of the capital shares, or other forms of governmental participation and effective influence
 in all the main aspects of management of the enterprise".
\par <#/>Parastatals are therefore business organizations established and owned by the government, but which fall outside the direct control of the government except for matters of general policy. <#/>Th
ey have a measure of autonomy in their day to day operation.
\par <#/>In Kenya, parastatals vary quite considerably in their rationale and function. <#/>They vary in their methods of incorporation, in their relationship to the central administrative structure, 
their source of capital funds and the degree of management independence. <#/>For instance, a parastatal may be established by an order made by the president by virtue of the powers <-/confered> upon him by Section 3(1) of the state Corporations Act which 
states: }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 "The President may, by order, establish a state corporation as a body corporate to perform the functions specified in the order"}{\b\fs24\lang2057 </X><quote/>}{\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>In exercise of this power, for example, the President proclaimed the Nyayo Tea Zones Development Corporation order.
\par <#/>A parastatal may also be established by or under an Act of parliament or other written law. <#/>Examples, of such parastatals include the Kenya Railways Corporation the Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation and the Kenya To
urist Development Corporation.
\par <#/>Parastatals in Kenya are engaged in a wide spectrum of economic activities which include agriculture, manufacturing, commerce, financial, mining and other services. <#/>They are the government's tools for direct participa
tion in commercial <-/activiies> in the economy. <#/>A look at government policy guidelines reveals that parastatals are expected to fulfil a number of objectives and roles in the economy. <#/>As earlier stated, being the government's tools for direct par
t
icipation in the economy, the government uses parastatals to control the economy. <#/>By establishing parastatals, the government is able to control strategic sectors of the economy. <#/>This ensures a certain amount of planning and management of the econ
o
my, so that the <-/scarse> resources available are utilized in a rational manner. <#/>Secondly, the government is able to supervise the private sector so that private enterprises are constrained from using their economic power to endanger the economic liv
es of citizens of this country. <#/>Therefore, in participating in the economy, the government ensures that the economic programmes and policies which it formulates are <-/effectwvely> implemented.
\par <#/>Perhaps, the most popular role parastatals are expected
 to fulfil in the Kenya economy is the Africanisation programme. <#/>At independence, the government sought ways and means of <-/correctly> the economic <-/imblances> which had been created by the colonial government. <#/>This government aimed at making t
he Africans take over the ownership and management of commerce and industry <#/>}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct>}{\fs24\lang2057 
several parastatals were assigned the role of implementing this policy. <#/>These include the Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation (ICDC), the Agricultural Finance Corporation Corporation (KTDC).
\par <#/>Parastatals are also expected to generate capital. <#/>One of the obstacles the government faces <-_is><+_in> its efforts to initiate economic development is lack of capital. <#/>Parastatals are therefore expec
ted to assist in generating capital to <-/>to be used in the development efforts.
\par <#/><-/Parastals> have also been used to provide a form which is conducive for the joint business ventures between the government and foreign investors. <#/>Multinational Cor
porations prefer to do business with parastatals. <#/>This is because such an arrangement gives the multinational corporation access to political connections and makes financial assistance, tax concessions and other governmental assistance possible. <#/>T
he Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation has entered into a number of joint venture agreements, most of them with multinational <-_corporation><+_corporations>.
\par <#/>Parastatals also do provide infrastructure and other basic utilities which are c
rucial in development activities. <#/>They are also used to create employment opportunities. <#/>This is indeed a crucial role especially in a country like Kenya where unemployment rates are very high.
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<#/>Parastatals have also been used to development sec
tors of the economy in which the private sector would be unwilling or unable to enter due to large capital outlays. <#/>Such projects may also not be profitable. <#/>The government however, establishes parastatals to develop such projects because they may
 provide vital products and services.
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang1031 {<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
Therefore a general, parastatals are supposed to play a major role in the economy. <#/>However, it has been argued that they have been unable to play this role. <#/>They have incurred large financial losses and have
 been inefficient. <#/>This has been the reason for the call for privatisation.
\par <h> <#/>}{\fs24\ul\lang2057 The case for Privatisation}{\fs24\lang2057  </h>
\par <#/>Simply defined, privatisation is the transfer of an enterprise from the government to the private sector. <#/>It is therefore the tr
ansfer from state ownership to private ownership. <#/>Advocates of privatisation have put forward several reasons for the same. <#/>Indeed the most forceful and persuasive case for privatisation of parastatals was spelt out by the working party on governm
ent expenditure. <#/>In the report, it was argued that the government had intervened excessively in the economy. <#/>The report stated: 
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 "the Government is now too widely and deeply
\par <#/>involved in activities which would be more appropriately
\par <#/>and efficiently conducted without Government participation"}{\b\fs24\lang2057 </X><quote/>}{\fs24\lang2057 .}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>It has been further argued that this intervention inhibits competition as parastatals are accorded a lot of protection. <#/><}{\b\fs24\lang2057 quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The lack of effective competition kills initiative, c
reativity and incentive and in the end economic growth is hindered"}{\b\fs24\lang2057 </X><quote/>.}{\fs24\lang2057  <#/>The advocates of privatisation are therefore telling the government that it has no business doing business.
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<#/>All it should do is to provide infrastructure that will ensure an environment conducive to private investment.
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang1031 {<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The working party report also stated that some parastatals had ex
ceeded their original mandates and made investments in commercial and industrial activities that should have been left entirely to the private sectors. <#/>The government should leave such activities to the private sector which can handle them effectively
.
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {
<#/>Another reason that makes privatisation of parastatals imperative is the fact that most of them have operated inefficiently and unprofitably. <#/>This is because the government has imposed public functions and excessive employment obligations on them.
 <#/>Secondly, the management of these parastatals is not qualified in most cases. <#/>Appointments to top positions have been used as acts of political patronage. <#/>It has been asserted that "all governments (in East Africa), but more so Kenya, regard 
the membership of the board of directors of public corporations as an opportunity to exercise political patronage". <#/>This has contributed immensely to the mismanagement of parastatals.
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang1031 {<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 It has also been argued that private investors and other co-owner
s of parastatals have abused the government's participation. <#/>They have diverted funds to inappropriate technologies and lofty capital-intensive projects which have served to burden the government with huge debts. <#/>These private investors have also 
c
ommitted the government to biased management agreements. <#/>This has ended up costing the government a lot of money and yet the private investors have made large sums of money through transfer pricing in the procurement of machinery and capital from abro
ad. <#/>These private investors are mainly multinational corporations.
\par <#/>Underlying the privatisation thesis therefore, is the belief that private enterprises tend to be more efficient than public enterprises. <#/>It is therefore assumed that once privati
sed, the loss-making parastatals will be turned around to show profit.
\par <h> <#/>}{\fs24\ul\lang2057 Legal issues in the Privatisation exercise}{\fs24\lang2057  </h>
\par <#/>Despite the fact that the Kenya government has already embarked on the privatisation exercise, several legal <-/isses> concer
ning the exercise have not been addressed. <#/>It appears that the government is in a hurry to carry out the exercise. <#/>It is therefore certain that unless these issues are addressed, the exercise will not be successful.
\par <#/>The privatisation exercise h
as already been described as illegal. <#/>It is clear that this is the position. <#/>This is because parastatals are established and governed by Acts of Parliament. <#/>It is therefore imperative that their disposal be subject to law. <#/>There is therefo
re need for a privatisation law to be enacted by parliament to give the exercise legal authority.
\par <#/>The privatisation law will also address other issues. <#/>The law should moot the objectives of privatisation and methods and procedures to be followed in 
the exercise. <#/>It should also chart out the format of selling shares, either by public or private offers. <#/>Privatisation involves the transfer of national assets to private individuals and institutions. <#/>Unless clear guidelines are given specifyi
ng how and to whom the shares are transferable, the whole exercise could <-_became><+_become> a fiasco. <#/>The basis upon which some parastatals have been designated strategic and others non-strategic is not known. <#/>The law should address this issue.

\par <#
/>Formulation of a privatisation law will also be crucial in spelling out procedures of dealing with limited liability companies which are subject to <-/theprovisions> of the Companies Act and the rights of private shareholders of joint venture companies 
s
ome of whom are foreigners. <#/>The selling of State's shareholding in such companies will require protracted negotiations with the other shareholders. <#/>The list of parastatals to be privatised which was released by the government contains companies wh
ose shares are not freely transferable. <#/>The existing shareholders have pre-emptive rights over the sale of shares and can oppose privatisation. <#/>It is crucial that a law be enacted to address these issues.
\par <#/>Another issue that has not been addresse
d is that of employees who will be declared <-/redudant> as a result of privatisation. <#/>Most of the parastatals had over-employed people. <#/>Loss of jobs will therefore be an inevitable consequence of privatisation. <#/>There is therefore need for a l
aw to be enacted to enable the government handle employees who will be declared redundant. 
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Since there is a lack of private investors in Kenya, privatisation may mean the internationalisation of the national economy or the concentration of ownership of 
the privatised companies in a small, rich section of the country. <#/>It is imperative that a law be enacted to guard against this and also to set out what proportion of shares can be offered to foreigners. <#/>If this is not done, there is a danger of th
e indigenisation process of the economy being <-/showed>.
\par <#/>The law will also have to clearly lay down the procedures of settling disputes. <#/>Disputes will be inevitable especially considering the hurry in which the exercise has been implemented.
\par <h> <#/>}{\v\fs24\ul\lang2057 Conclusion </h>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
\par <#/>The privatisation exercise is aimed at improving the profitability of parastatals and easing the burden these parastatals have had on the economy. <#/>This should in turn accelerate economic progress. <#/>It is clear that parastatals 
have an important role to play in the economy but due to <-/theproblems> they have encountered, they have not been able to play this role effectively. }{\fs24\lang2057 </X>}{\v\fs24\lang2057

\par <#/>The last two decades have witnessed growing concern over environmental degradation and the need to undertake measures 
which will ensure that development is not achieved at the cost of the environment. <#/>International concern for environmental consideration began, however, at the turn of the century. <#/>Most of the bodies or agencies were mainly concerned with water po
llution. <#/>In 1947 the United Nations Economic and Social Council adopted solution 32(V) which <foreign/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 inter }{\fs24\lang2057 <foreign/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 alia }{\fs24\lang2057 
recognized the importance of the world's natural resources and techniques of conservation. <#/>This concern was enhanced by the disastrous consequences of the Second World War and the rapid industrial growth after it.
\par <#/>Global concern for environmental protection gained momentum after the 1972 U.N. <#/>Conference on the Human Environment which passed a declaration to the effect that }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
'Man has the fundamental rights to freedom, equality and adequate conditions of life, in an environment of a quality that permits a life of dignity and well being'}{\b\fs24\lang2057 </X><quote/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
 (Principle 1). <#/>The declaration further called for the recognition by 
states of their responsibility to ensure the protection of the environment for the present and future generations. <#/>The conference also established the United Nations Environmental Programme, which has since its establishment produced a number of guide
lines on human health, ocean pollution control and environmental impact assessment. <#/>This led to a number of states undertaking measures to protect the environment through law and policy.
\par <#/>The World Commission on Environment and Development equally recognized the need for environmental protection and man's right to a healthy environment. <#/>The report of the commission points out that }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
'All human beings have the fundamental right to an environment adequate for their health and well-being and states shall conserve and use the environment and natural resources for the benefit of present and future generations."}{\b\fs24\lang2057 </X><
quote/>.}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <#/>In most countries, development in whatever form has been largely achieved at the cost of the environment. <#/>The need for so
und environmental management has been viewed as a constraint in attempts to achieve rapid economic growth. <#/>This has resulted in irreplaceable environmental damage. <#/>Today, most developing countries are faced with the threat of desertification, defo
restation and pollution, as a result of immense environmental degradation. <#/>The eventual result is the loss of animal and plant species, change in rain patterns and disappearance of rain forests.
\par <#/>Thus, in seeking rapid economic development, countries
 have indirectly contributed towards their eventual underdevelopment, as the quality of life and that of the entire environment is ignored. <#/>These concerns have led to the call for sustainable development which will ensure that the needs of the present
 
generation are met without compromising the needs of future generations. <#/>Sustainable development does not occur in one day; it is a gradual process of change. <#/>It calls for a change in economic and environmental policies and <-_legislations><+_legi
s
lation> as well as changes in institutions concerned with exploitation and management of natural resources, economic investments and population size and growth. <#/>It also calls for the full participation of every man, woman and child. <#/>It is especial
ly important to involve those directly concerned with the environment in their daily activities.
\par <#/>The process of determining public policy issues, such as the degree and}{\b\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 scope of environmental protection, is a combination of both policy and law. <#/>Law 
can facilitate national decision making and as well be used as a tool for transforming policy formulations into practice. <#/>In the scope of environmental protection, law should not be seen in the passive light of a facilitator of policy implementation s
ince it must play the role of requiring policy where the same is wanting.
\par <#/>Law assumes a three-dimensional role in environmental management. <#/>Firstly, law provides for the allocation of natural resources and the regulation of their exploitation and ma
nagement. <#/>Secondly, law provides the set standards which have to be met, failing which, sanctions are provided. <#/>This is effectively carried out through a licence system, whereby the licence-holder is required to comply with the terms of the licenc
e. <#/>Lastly, law establishes the mechanism for controlling the impact of human activities on the environment. <#/>This is carried out through the establishment of institutions which are empowered to undertake adequate measures to ensure environ\-
mental protection.
\par <#/>In any country, policy makers have the difficult task of making decisions which promote development but do not influence the environment. <#/>Thus, environmental legislation should seek to harmonize environmental conservation objectives and na
tional developmental goals and aspirations.
\par <#/>Environmental legislation should seek to deal with existing, future and recurring environmental problems, if sustainability is to be ensured.
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<#/>Kenya has to grapple with the question of environmental protec
tion and socio-economic development to avoid the same environmental consequences suffered by the developed and industrialized countries in their bid to achieve economic growth. <#/>Apart from this, the challenge of sustainable development coupled with the
 debt crisis and environmental degradation are issues of great concern.
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang1031 {<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
In the early post-independence years, Kenya adopted African socialism as the official policy. <#/>This recognized the need to preserve and conserve natural resources for future gene
rations and that quality of the environment must be up on equal footing with the need for its exploitation. <#/>Concern by the government has, since the early 1970s, been increasing and this is reflected in past development plans, which call for programme
s
 to carry out environmental monitoring and assessment, arresting desertification, pollution control, human settlements and environmental education. <#/>Despite this concern, Kenya's environmental policy cannot be found in one sound document but rather in 
various ministerial statements, development plans, sessional papers and legislation.
\par <#/>Environmental law, on the other hand, is sectoral and administrative in nature. <#/>It is mainly concerned with the regulation of the use of water, land, minerals and f
orests as well as wildlife and marine life protection. <#/>Most of the statutes are inherited from the late colonial era, a time when the administration's concern was centred on the full exploitation of existing natural resources. <#/>Thus, protection and
 
conservation of the environment was of minimal concern. <#/>Existing statutory laws address a problem once it has risen and not before. <#/>Other than statutory environmental laws, the English common law applies in situations where there are no statutory 
p
rovisions on environmental protection. <#/>The common law is applicable 'so far as the circumstances of Kenya and its inhabitants permit and subject to such qualifications as those circumstances may make necessary'. <#/>Currently, there are 66 statutes in
 
force which touch and affect the environment. <#/>There is therefore no comprehensive statute on the environment. <#/>This section considers those laws on land, water and forestry as the areas where women are largely active in their day to day activities.

\par <#/>Kenya's land-use policy is found in scattered legislation, sessional papers, ministerial statements and development plans. <#/>The 1989-93 development plan provides that }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
'Land use policy relates to the system of laws, rules, regulations and pra
ctices that govern the rights and obligations of land owners towards the achievement of the public interest with the aim of ensuring optimal use of available land to meet the needs of the population\rquote }{\b\fs24\lang2057 </X><quote/>}{\fs24\lang2057 .

\par <#/>Land issues are very sensitive as well as complex due to the important attachment that everyone has on land. <#/>This has led to numerous enacted laws, which make provision for registration, land tenure and permitted uses of land.
\par <#/>In an economy which lays emphasis on agriculture, competing inte
rests are bound to arise between the users and the environmental managers of land. <#/>These conflicts are further enhanced by land ownership laws which confer absolute proprietorship, giving the owner the right to do whatever he or she wishes with the la
nd. <#/>The emphasis on intensified agriculture may also defeat the goals of sound environmental management. <#/>Sessional Paper No. I of 1986 on economic management for renewed growth emphasizes the need for intensified agriculture by pointing out that }
{\b\fs24\lang2057 <quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057

e
nactment of the Registered Land Act (Cap. 300) saw the introduction of absolute proprietorship conferring the owner with absolute rights over property. <#/>The Act was introduced because of falling standards of agriculture in the African reserves; these w

\par <#/>One marked feature of the adjudication, consolidation and registration process of the 1950s was that women were not registered as owners of land. <#/>This could be tied up to a number
 of reasons, one being that the adjudicators found it difficult to determine ownership of land held communally and as a result opted to register that land under the name of the head of the house. <#/>This is traditionally a man. <#/>The other reason given
 is that under customary laws and practice, women do not own land and as a result there was no need to register women as land owners.
\par <#/>The idea behind registration of land in names of individuals under the Registered Land Act was to enable that owner to 
develop the agricultural output of the land. <#/>This could be done by seeking a loan for that purpose from a financial institution. <#/>In order to ensure the productive use and so the conservation of that land, other laws were enacted which imposed duti
es on land owners.

\par <#/>Environmental laws in Kenya are not gender specific in that at their enactment they were geared towards both men and women. <#/>These laws are, however, mainly concerned with those areas where women's participation is the greatest, for example agricul
t
ure, forestry, human settlement and water. <#/>It is also clear that despite the fact of gender neutrality of the law, women's experiences do not seem to have been considered in the enactment of these laws. <#/>Women have continued to be ignored, despite 
the role they play in environmental conservation.
\par <#/>Women in Kenya play a key role in agricultural production and have also contributed towards the development of that area. <#/>This is also the position in any other African countries. <#/>During the colo
nial era, women played important roles both directly and indirectly in agricultural production; however, the policy makers marginalized women's agricultural work and emphasized male wage labour on large agricultural farms. <#/>Thus women modified their ec
o
nomic activities and planted crops for subsistence. <#/>Introduction of agricultural technology and better farming techniques served the large farms, leaving the women farmers to apply their out-dated methods and techniques. <#/>Laws and policies on land 
o
wnership and access to credit also played their role in further marginalizing women, who did not own the land they tilled or have access to credit facilities for purpose of loans. <#/>As a result, in most African countries the post-colonial era introduced
 modern technologies, fertilizers and credit services for plantation agriculture, ignoring subsistence agriculture.
\par <#/>Other than participation in agricultural production, women are also engaged in gathering wood for fuel purposes and fetching water for household use. <#/>It is the same women who are household managers and bearers and care-takers of children.
\par <#/>Bearing in mind the role that women play in agricultural production, energy and water consumption and reproduction, one can clearly see that women
 have a direct impact on the environment, depending on their needs. <#/>Thus, in agriculture they have an impact on land either through crop farming or livestock keeping. <#/>In gathering wood, they have an impact on the forests; in using water from the l
a
kes and rivers, they have an impact on the available water resources. <#/>Their own health will play a role in determining the health of the children they bear. <#/>All this women's work has for very long gone unrecognized despite its contribution towards
 development.
\par <#/>Women have for a long time contributed towards environmental destruction in their day to day activities. <#/>This has gone unrecognized because women's work has continued to be ignored. <#/>If sustainable development through sound environm
ental management is to be achieved, there is need to give utmost consideration to the experiences of those persons directly concerned with the environment in their day to day activities. <#/>Thus when it comes, to good land management the experiences of w
omen need consideration. <#/>There is therefore a need for legislators and policy makers to ask themselves <foreign/>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 inter }{\fs24\lang2057 <foreign/>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 alia }{\v\fs24\lang2057 
why women continue to destroy the environment, or why they are ignorant of environmental management techniques.
\par <#/>In 
asking these questions they need to bear in mind several factors. <#/>Firstly, as long as women are the gatherers of firewood, for lack of alternative energy fuel, the forests will continue to be destroyed and desertification will accelerate. <#/>Secondly
,
 as long as reafforestation and afforestation programmes are directed towards men, who are not the gatherers of wood for domestic consumption, deforestation will continue. <#/>Thirdly, as long as sound agricultural techniques and proper use of fertilizers
 
are taught to men or large plantation owners, soil depletion and poor land management will continue. <#/>This is coupled with the fact that most women do not have a registerable interest in the land that they till. <#/>Lastly, as long as the reproductive 
health of women is underemphasized, the health of their children will dete\-riorate. <#/>And, as population continues to grow, over-exploitation of existing natural resources will continue.
\par <#/>Bearing in mind that a majority of the women are either illitera
te or <-/semi-illiterate>, enacted policies or laws should make provision to ensure that these women fully understand and use them to advantage. <#/>Currently, the Agriculture Act, which provides the law for sound land management, is geared towards land o
w
ners, a majority of whom are men. <#/>As a result, women are left out or are unaware of the benefits that may arise under this Act. <#/>The Forest Act provides penal sanctions for those who flout the law but does no more. <#/>The result is that people wil
l continue to gather wood and destroy forests for lack of alternatives as long as they are not caught doing so.
\par <#/>A number of feminists and ecological feminists (eco-feminists) argue that the oppression of nature is intertwined with the oppression of wome
n, due to oppressive patriarchal culture, which underlines women's experience. <#/>Due to the non-recognition of women's experiences and over-emphasis on male experiences, there is further environmental deterioration. <#/>That women do interact with the e
n
vironment in their daily activities cannot be denied, hence the need to carefully consider their needs and experiences. <#/>Solutions to environmental deterioration therefore need to consider these, and, from a feminist perspective, as argued by eco-femin
i
sts. <#/>Environmental deterioration is, however, a concern for all - men, women and children alike, but in its proper management, it would be necessary to consider the experiences of those responsible for its destruction. <#/>Women more than men are larg
ely responsible for destruction of the environment because of their work and daily activities. <#/>Thus, they and their children are the first to suffer from degradation of the environment, }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
furthening> the need for their consideration.
\par <#/>As indicated earlier, Kenya's environmental legislation is gender neutral, but it was enacted ignoring the impact of women's activities on the environment. <#/>If these legislations }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 are to ensure sound environmental management in line with Kenya's current co
nservation policies, there is a need for their amendment to ensure consideration of the role of women in environmental management. <#/>However, it is also important to consider the role women can play in their amendment, repeal or enactment. <#/>Though wo
m
en cannot actively undertake the actual drafting of legislation, their input can be made in various ways. <#/>Women, if fully and actively engaged in conservation programmes, can give valuable opinions and experiences in environmental conservation, which 
c
an assist legislators and policy makers in adopting informed policies. <#/>They can also invite the views of women regarding certain laws, policies, implementation and viability with a view to amendment or repeal. <#/>The full integration of women in deve
l
opment can enable them to air their views and experiences on those legal constraints that either cut or retard their full participation. <#/>It would also be important to consider women and environmental conservation in the traditional societies and the e
xisting tribal laws and customs.
\par <#/>Other than using women's experiences in reshaping environmental laws and policies, there has to be another development for women. <#/>This calls for alternatives to their daily burden which might include inexpensive fuel
, better and inexpensive farming tools and techniques and ways of bringing water closer to the home. <#/>The availability of these will in turn enable women to attend and fully participate in environmental management programmes. <#/>They will also be able
 to participate in policy making if called to do so.
\par <#/>It is clear that without alternatives to ease the burden of women, the goals of any comprehensive law and policy for sustainable development will be elusive. }{\fs24\lang2057 </X>}{\v\fs24\lang2057

\par <#/>The most important event of the 1980s for girls' education 
in Kenya was the hosting of the United Nations End of the Decade for Women Conference Nairobi. <#/>Torild Skard (the UNESCO delegate to the UN Conference) put the significance of the decade into perspective:
\par <#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 <quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 One of the outstanding events of the last hundred years, which may be considered a turning point in history, }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 
is the change in the way women live, the statements made about them and the action taken concerning them. <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 A new awareness has arisen that the situation of women in general is unjust. (emphasis added, Skard, 1985, p. 1)}{
\b\fs24\lang2057 </X><quote/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>She said that the decade had brought new understanding of the persistent and complex social structures and interests that perpetuate the subordinate status of women. <#/>It was noted that ten years' effor
ts had not fundamentally altered this status, and that no one felt any longer that there were any quick and easy solutions to the dilemma.
\par <#/>The present study on Kenyan primary textbooks (as an index of women's future participation in national}{\b\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 development) is designed to examine the role of education in the shaping of a modern nation.
\par <#/>Taking stock in 1991, as we enter the last decade of the Twentieth Century, it is important to point out that concepts of development are more explicitly described, deve
lopment processes and supposed change agents of development are being more closely examined, while the tool of analysis termed }{\i\fs24\lang2057 the gender perspective }{\fs24\lang2057 is throwing new light on to}{\b\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 
both concepts and processes of development. <#/>It is no coincidence that the 
topic of education for girls and women figures more prominently in the current global development debate; nor that Kenyan society has grown so acutely interested and well informed about education. <#/>It is also no coincidence that some elements of stagna
t
ion in education systems, areas of neglect, are causing increasing tension, particularly as overall school populations rise dramatically, as is the case in Kenya. <#/>It is generally recognised, notably since the 1990 Jomtien UNESCO Conference on Educatio
n
 For All, that education plays a crucial (and costly) role in national development and that schooling systems must be made more responsive to national, to individual and to diverse social group needs, including the needs of various social groups of girl l
earners.
\par <#/>To return to 1985, in Kenya the preparations for the UN Conference were accompanied by a noticeable increase of information-sharing among women. <#/>New energy was devoted to research on the subject of women's participation in development. <#/>
From the beginning of the year the national press began printing articles on women, development and the environment that concentrated on the hitherto unrecognised role of women as the major agricultural producers and food processors, as the backbone of ag
ricultural production in Africa. <#/>Statistics indicated that 80 percent of agricultural labour in the region is performed by women }{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Sivard, 1985), }{\fs24\lang2057 
a higher percentage than in other regions of the world, for example, Asia. <#/>At the same time, the Ethiopi
an famine gained worldwide attention; the links between famine, poverty, development, retrogressive modes of agriculture, access to technology and the status of women, became apparent. <#/>It is not new today to state that development policies which negle
c
t or marginalise the role of women in agriculture are policies which lead inexorably to decreased agricultural output, degradation of the environment, deterioration of nutritional levels, hunger, poverty and eventually to economic crises on the national, 
regional and, in the case of Africa, on the continental scale.
\par <#/>It has become more widely recognised that
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 ... the true role of women in society is largely unknown, that a great deal of prejudice and mistaken ideas persist and that }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 considerable ef

\par <#/>The present study is an attempt to fill in an information gap on girls' education. <#/>Formal education is overly expensive in developing countries, con
suming 30 percent or more of most national budgets in Africa. <#/>Yet enrolment figures for girls are relatively low and their school performance is inferior to that of boys. <#/>In conclusion girls are not full participators in school education. <#/>The 
following questions arise. <#/>Is the inadequate participation of girls in education due solely to their relative absence from school? <#/>Or are there additional in-school factors which reduce girls' participation?
\par <#/>In the former case (failure to attend
 school), the drop-out syndrome and the low enrolment figures have been well documented. <#/>The second question (in-school factors) is still largely unexplored in Africa. <#/>Girls continue to sit in classrooms, at enormous cost to the nation and to thei
r parents, and to underachieve both in school and in the world of work }{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Kagia, 1985)}{\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>The next question is: What are the factors leading to girls' apparent withdrawal from learning while at school and to their minimal participation in education?
\par <#/>The
 education setting is one of pupils, teachers, textbooks, classroom materials, teaching methodology, administrative practices and the 'school culture'. <#/>The present study aims at examining just one of these factors, the textbook, to gain insight into t
he type of education experienced in Kenyan schools.
\par <#/>At the same time the researchers are aware of the wider social context, the outside school context of learning, and of the general trends in society. <#/>There is evidence, for instance, that the livin
g conditions and life chances of women are deteriorating }{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Sivard, 1985)}{\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>On an international scale the literacy gap between men and women is widening. <#/>Increased educational provision in both developed and developing countries has not automatically 
opened the doors of educational opportunity to women, nor has it equalised educational outcomes in terms of careers. <#/>There is a call, insistent and growing, for a new concept of development which involves all sectors of society and which centres on pe
o
ple and which emphasises people as the rightful beneficiaries of development rather than states, national budgets or industrialisation. <#/>A Latin American delegate to the World Conference of the Society for International Development in Rome in 1985 put 
it this way:

\par <#/>To reduce the marginalisation of women both women and men will have to develop positive images of females. <#/>The attitudes of both men and women towa
rds females are at stake here, for it is women as well as men who make decisions on the nature of women's participation in society. <#/>For example, in drought-stricken areas of the world it is often the women themselves who make a social decision about w

where women work as hard or harder than men at growing food'. <#/>According to nutritionists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, surveys on people suffering famine in Burkina Faso and Ethiopia found a 'marked disparity between the sexes

\par <#/>These facts, together with evidence on the increasing scarcity of fire\-wood which has forced the Nepalese and Kenyan women to walk further each day in search of fuelwood, bui

y consuming 40 percent of the Kenyan national budget). <#/>In addition, heavy opportunity costs have to be accounted for at the individual family level. <#/>Since Independence the express purpose of the education system has been to forge national and soci
a
l unity, reduce social inequities and imbalances and compensate for individual or sectoral historical disadvantages. <#/>Schooling therefore becomes of particular interest to women, who are visibly a low-achieving group in Kenyan society today. <#/>The fo
r
mal education system, unlike the informal non-institutionalised education practices of the home, can modify itself, if modification should be necessary, since it is a deliberately planned national activity with in-built mechanisms for self-review and muta
tion. <#/>The education system is eminently accessible to investigation since its activities are public, often recorded in writing and carried out in}{\b\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 easily definable situations, that is, in the school.
\par <#/>Kenya is an interesting case in point in this disc
ussion for three reasons: first, the new education reform of 1985 (known as the 8-4-4 system) is designed to bring technical education down to the primary level thereby reaching the majority of school-going children; second, since primary school enrolment
s
 in the first year of schooling are approximately equal for girls and boys in this country, girls would appear to have new and significant access to technical education for the first time; third, the vocationally oriented curriculum includes agriculture, 
and agricultural production is linked with length of schooling, although the relationship between the two is not yet fully understood}{\v\fs24\lang2057  (see also Chapters 6 and 9)}{\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>It is the aim of the present study to examine the messages on the role of girls and women in society passed to girls and boys through school text\-
books in Kenya. <#/>It concerns the content of the messages, the medium through which they are passed and the mechanisms at work in the passing of such messages. <#/>It suggests ways to counteract any
 discriminatory messages which may be identified. <#/>Analyses of school textbooks have been carried out in several countries. <#/>The only one we know of from Africa relating to sex stereotyping is a Zambian study }{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Tembo, 1983) }{
\fs24\lang2057 where the textbooks examine
d originated from outside that country (from Britain). <#/>Given the different educational patterns evolving in African countries, it is important to look at Kenyan textbooks, which have all been written and published within the country since about 1970, 
in order to fully understand the national context and to plan for change that would be appropriate for Kenyan society and for strategies of social transformation that would be commensurate with Kenya's way of doing things.

is the formation of noncritical, summary judgements by one social group with reference to another in order to minimise the threat of the perceived
 differences between the groups or to ward off change that threatens the well-being, power or dominance of the in-group. <#/>The view becomes a negative one (e.g. chauvinism, ethnocentrism, sexism, racism) based on prejudice, fear or dislike. <#/>The ster
eotype is transmitted from one generation to the next through social experiences within the group; stereotyped views are more resistant to change than is reality.
\par <#/>Individuals of the out-group (women in this case) are perceived exclusively as members of that group; that is, they are viewed as typical or atypical with reference to the stereotype which serves as a model or norm for <+_}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057

the in-group's perception (men's perception) of the out-group. <#/>As a result of stereotyping, which is common to both the in-group and the out-group, group behaviour becomes conditioned by the stereotype, thus reinforcing and justifying stereotypical be
haviour. <#/>This applies to women's and men's behaviour.
\par <#/>Men and women have similar sexist stereotyped views of themselves and of each other; they both undervalue women. <#/>Self-underestimation is created either by women's guilt feelings, leading to s
elf-accusation, or by their tendency to identify with the attitudes of the power group, the in-group, in order to share in the prestige and power. <#/>All this necessitates the undervaluing of their own group. <#/>Self-underestimation has been a notorious

\par <#/>There is need to packa
ge family planning and birth control methods information according to each target groups' needs, the reason being that each group interprets similar information differently. <#/>Cultural and religious background of the individuals come in. <#/>For example
 
the research findings have shown that most of the people in the Nyakoe location belong to the Roman Catholic church which is against the use of any artificial family planning method and recommends the use of natural methods. <#/>With such revelations; the
re is need to prepare the messages in such a way that they do not violate the peoples' beliefs and values or in such a way that the people are first convinced to change their attitudes so that they can listen and adopt the new innovation brought to them.

\par <#
/>Most of the respondents (48%) were found to be solely peasant farmers and even those who were in other occupations like teaching, still carried out some farming activities. <#/>So we get that most of the people in the area are farmers who are bound to p
roduce enough food for consumption since the area's climate - of highland equatorial zones with moderate temperatures and relief rainfall which is well spread all the year round encourage good production of both cash and food crops.
\par <#/>The production of en
ough food can be one of the factors which encourage people to have more children for to most of them, the only problem is feeding <-/childrn> so that when they can produce enough to feed their families; they continue to give birth to more children.
\par <#/>Mos
t of the respondents (68%) were found to have married between the age of 14-22 years and out of these, 46% were females. <#/>This has an effect on the population growth for when people marry at an early age; they have many years of giving birth. <#/>This 
a
pplies mostly to women for when one gets married at the age of 15 years, they have around 35 active child bearing years. <#/>In such a case, if one does not use any family planning or birth control method, they are capable of giving birth up to 20 childre
n all the other factors constant.
\par <#/>The early marriage age of most respondents coupled with the fact that 96 per cent of them were still living with their partners shows that those who married early had all the chances of having more than 10 children each
. <#/>The other factor which can contribute to high population growth rates is that most female respondents lived together with their husbands hence few chances that the absence of one partner in the house all the year round can act as a means of populati
on growth control. <#/>Even those women whose husbands were employed as for example, teachers, they still operated either from their rural homes or those who had moved to live next to the school, moved with their wives and families.
\par <#/>On the respondents' 
level of schooling, we get that 98 per cent had been to school. <#/>When we looked at the relationship between the level of schooling of the respondents and the number of children they had, the findings show that the higher the level of a respondent's edu
c
ation; the fewer the number of children one had. <#/>Hence with this, one gets that those respondents with primary 1-4 level of education had an average number of 6.1 children while those with secondary form 5-6 level of education had an average of 3.4 ch
ildren.
\par <#/>From the difference in the number of children and the level of education, one can say that those who had a higher level of education were more enlightened about the problems which come up with large and unplanned families. <#/>Since awareness of
 the existence of a problem makes people to have an interest in ways of solving it, the educated respondents must have gone out of their cultural and religious beliefs to embrace new values which can help them.
\par <#/>While on the other hand, those who have a
 lower level of education, it could be that they have been confined to the rural areas where most adhere to their traditional and religious values since they have not been exposed to outside ideas, hence they end up getting many children.
\par <#/>All the male 
respondents had at least an education level of class five and above while there were those with no education at all among the female respondents. <#/>The variation in educational levels could be due to the fact that most of the rural parents are yet to be
 convinced that education is as good for girls as it is for boys. <#/>In the olden days, taking girls to school was seen as a waste of resources and time hence few females have gone for higher education.
\par <h> <#/>}{\fs24\ul\lang2057 Children's education}{\fs24\lang2057  </h>
\par }\pard\plain \s16\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \v\lang2057 {\v0 <#/>Most of the res
pondents had school going children. <#/>Those who said that only some and not all their children go to school either said that the children were not yet of school going age, or for the school going age ones, they were out because the parents could not rai
se their school fees or uniforms for them to be allowed to stay in school while others were past the school-going age.
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang1031 {\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The lack of means to cater for the children's needs could be because most of the needs are provided for by the parents (74%) and yet m
ost of them are not salary earners. <#/>Most of the parents depend on farming which is letting them down now that population has increased, land has been sub-divided and there are more structures on the land hence leaving less land for farming - which mea
n
s less cultivation and less income and yet 44 per cent of the respondents said that to solve school related problems; they had to sell farm produce. <#/>There is need for the people to reduce the population growth so that there can be enough land left for
 them to carry out farming since it is their source of income.
\par <#/>Most of the respondents (96%) said they deliver their children at a hospital and all of them attend clinics when expectant. <#/>Such a revelation is very encouraging considering the fact that presently most of the information on family planning and th
e
 use of birth control methods is passed to the mothers when they <-/gofor> anti and post natal clinics. <#/>This is done when the mothers attend clinics. <#/>The clinical officers or doctor in charge first addresses them about the care of the children spa
cing and stopping. <#/>With this; they tell the mothers where to get <O/> when they need them.
\par <#/>The other encouraging factor is that 66 per cent of the respondents said they had no intention of having more children than they had. <#/>About what they thou
ght was the ideal number of children which make a happy family; most of them cited four children. <#/>Some of those who gave four as the ideal number had less or more than four children and they cited various reasons as to why they want that. <#/>From thi
s
, one can say that the people are for the idea of small families but the problem could be that they have no idea as to what steps they should take to have only the desired number and sex of children. <#/><-/Infact> most of the respondents were willing to 
stop having more children but for those who had either only boys or girls, they were for the idea that they can stop only after they have children of both sexes.
\par <#/>The sex of children becomes important and more so male children because as in most African 
societies, the Gusii community valued male children most for the females were only temporary residents hence the males were left in the home as inheritors, to take care of the parents in their old age and to continue the family's name. <#/>The same trend 
has persisted up to today so that any couple without a male child still feel that they have not fulfilled the demands of a marriage.
\par <h> <#/>}{\fs24\ul\lang2057 Media Ownership and Use}{\fs24\lang2057  </h>
\par <#/>On media ownership and use, the research findings showed that most (84%) of the res
pondents own a radio and depend on it as their source of news and information about them and the outside world. <#/>This supports earlier research findings that most of the people in rural areas in Kenya depend on radio to know what goes on in and outside
 
their society. <#/>The results showed that most of the respondents (36%) who own a radio set were peasant farmers. <#/>This shows that however hard it is to get money even for basic needs, the rural people value information and news very much. <#/>This ca
m
e out clearly during the research session, for even those who complained of their children being out of school now and then due to lack of either school fees of uniforms, were found to have had batteries for their radios. <#/>When asked as to how long it 
took them to buy new batteries when the old ones run out; the longest time named was five days while other respondents said they were always on air because they budgeted for batteries, hence were always able to buy new ones in time.
\par <#/>The revelations on b
atteries and how they are catered for contradicted the answers given by the respondents when they were asked as to how they solved child related problems. <#/>Only one respondent said that they had a bank account exclusively for the children's school need
s. <#/>The reasons given by the other respondents showed that there was no early budgeting for school needs till the problems came up is when the parents looked for ways of solving them }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>On the programmes listened to, the highest cited was g
reetings. <#/>This is a programme <-/where by> people send greeting cards to others and they are read over radio as a programme and some music is played in between. <#/>Family planning programmes were the second highest mentioned programmes in both the na
tional station (38%) and the local station which broadcasts in the local language (30%) - Kikisii.
\par <#/>The greetings programme being the most listened to could be because a majority of the respondents are peasant farmers so that they can afford to listen to
 radio as they work, and <-_its><+_it's> a known fact that most manual workers work better when there is some form of entertainment going on around them. <#/>The music from the radio has replaced the traditional style where people used to sing as they wor
ked. <#/>Entertainment in the form of music detracts people from thinking about the amount of work they have before them and the passage of time.

\par <#/>Although most of the female respondents (76%) }{\fs24 <-/dont><+_don't> }{\fs24\lang2057 
belong to their local Maendeleo Ya Wanawake Organization, it was encouraging to learn that more (68%) respondents attend the local public <ea/>barazas. <#/>This question is crucial a
s these local gatherings are very effective ways through which messages can be passed to the local people. <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
<#/>Literature has shown that people tend to believe information passed to them through face-to-face communication compared to that passed through the mass media for it sounds alien hence people assume that whatever problem there is does not concern them.

\par <#/>When the public <ea/>barazas are held, all sorts of problems and development projects are discussed. <#/>This could be the appropriate place to p
ass information aimed at changing peoples' attitude towards large families. <#/>The messages can be prepared keeping in mind the particular society's norms and cultural values for people will always tend to shy away from any new idea (innovation) which te

\par <#/>The church and society have always tended to influence the members' held values, hence the two institutions can be another channel through which family planning and birth control methods infor

stand that the implications of the high birth rate are a danger not only to society but to the world as a whole hence needs to be looked at critically.
\par <#/>Social institutions should have a clear stand on the use of artificial methods so that their members 
have a basis on which to base their decisions. <#/>The church which has since time immemorial ... come to the <-/resque> of the poor, should realize that time have changed and with the high cost of living, can only take care of a few people in need. <#/>T
hey can continue to help the poor but make it clear that they can only help families with few children. <#/>This will act as an incentive - as the unable will strive for smaller families to be assured of help.

\par <#/>The research findings have thrown some light as to why some of the people are reluctant to stop having more children than they had. <#/>On the number of female children each respo
ndent had and their intention to plan their families, we see that most of those with female children said they intend to plan their families while on the other hand, only 40 per cent of the respondents with 1 to 2 female children said the <-/dont><+_don't

\par <#/>The same idea came out when we looked at those who intend
ed to plan their families and the number of male children they had. <#/>Most of those willing were the ones with more than three male children. <#/>There is a coloration between those who intend to plan their families and the number of children of each se
x a respondent had. <#/>The findings show that most of the respondents are only ready to plan their families when they have two or more children of each sex.
\par <#/>There is need to teach people on the value of girls. <#/>When well taken care of and exposed to the right education, a female child can do as better as the male ones, hence able to help their parents when they grow old and helpless.
\par <h> <#/>}{\v\fs24\ul\lang2057 Church Denomination and Contraceptive Use </h>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
\par <#/>Research findings showed that there is a relationship betwe
en the respondents` church denomination and their use of birth control or family planning methods. <#/>Out of all the 50 respondents, 34 (72%) irrespective of their church affiliation use a family planning method. <#/>Out of the 34 respondents, 29 of them
 
belong to the Roman Catholic church. <#/>And out of these, 16 of them use the natural family planning method - breast-feeding and abstinence, 12 found the question not applicable, hence 9 of them used an artificial method. <#/>Respondents in the other den
o
minations too had a greater number using a natural method as compared to those who used an artificial method. <#/>Hence, out of the 40 respondents who use a family planning method, 27 used a natural method, while 13 used an artificial method. <#/>Since th
e
 findings revealed that most of the respondents use a natural method for one reason or another, there is need to educate the people more about the methods instead of pressing them into the use of artificial methods which they have rejected for one reason 
or another.
\par <#/>Those who are educated enough to <-/understnad> how the artificial methods are used can be encouraged to adopt them while those not well versed in the use of the methods and those with negative perceptions about the methods can be encouraged
 to use the natural methods. <#/>There is need for this to be done for earlier research has shown that when people are forced to participate in a new idea (innovation) which they <-/dont><+_don't> believe in, the programme will always tend to fail for mos
t participants will give up somewhere along the way and resort to their old practices.
\par <#/>On contraceptive use, methods like the diaphragm, foam, jelly and IUD were not mentioned by any respondent as one of the contraceptives <-/ehich> they use. <#/>Among 
the artificial contraceptives under use, most of them were used by the females. <#/>The least used among the methods under use was sterilization. <#/>Only two female respondents had been sterilized, and no male had been. <#/>The pill and condom were the m
ost used modern methods.
\par <#/>The low contraceptive use among men as compared to women could be due to the fact that the society is male dominated so that they leave everything to do with children to women. <#/>Even when it comes to child bearing and spacing
, it is the task of women to take the initiative and space their births or even stop having more children when they have had enough male and female children.
\par <#/>The respondents gave various reasons as to why there are few male sterilization cases if any. 
<#/>The most mentioned was that a sterilized man was a castrated man. <#/>When society members came to know that so and so's husband was sterilized, they stopped giving respect to such a man and the common phrase henceforth <-/woulld> be " there are two w
omen in that house" since to them the man has lost his manhood hence no longer a man. <#/>This has made many females to be against the idea of their husbands being sterilized - hence the women would rather they go for sterilization.

\par <#/>From the above, we can say that where educational media should be used as a means of communication, choices of media should be done on the kind of media most available among the people.
\par <#/>In the area under study, television should not be recommended as a channel because very few people own sets or have access to one.- The same as film and video which are still very alien to the people.
\par <#/>The research findings showed that most househol
ds own a radio set or have access to one and can be used by both the literate and the illiterate members of society. <#/>Most people, and especially peasant farmers were found to spend most of their day time listening to radio as they worked.
\par <#/>Even though print media is a useful channel as it is tangible and permanent, it will not be the best for poverty and illiteracy among the people renders it useless.
\par <#/>Extension workers are an ideal channel because they get to each individual, but then their setback is that the trained ones are few hence can only reach a small section of the population in need at a time.
\par <#/>The local social organizations like Maendeleo ya Wanawake groups can be ideal for there is the face-to-face contact involved which is very eff
ective when it comes to passing new innovations which are aimed at changing a people's held values. <#/>The groups encourage participation from all members and at the same time, it gives the illiterate members access to learning through their literate col
leagues. <#/>}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct}{\v\fs24\lang2057  hence family planning messages can be shared among members where those who have <-/benefitted> from the usage can convince the reluctant ones on its advantages and benefits.
\par <#/>Local public <ea/>barazas, for most people said they att
end them. <#/>The audience is there so that what is left is to get the knowledgeable people in each area to address the gathering i.e. from the ministry of health on family planning methods and give talks on the advantages of small and planned families.

\par <#
/>From the research findings, I think that for the research population to get the intended and relevant messages, radio, public <ea/>barazas and local social groups will be the most ideal communication channels to be used in passing family planning messag

\par <#/>From the research findings and the above discussion, we can say that there are some recommendations which need to be made.
\par <#/>Before messages are written, proper selection of media which should be dependent upon the audience and the message selected is needed. <#/>Research should be done on the knowledge, attitudes and practices of various audiences.

\par (a) the level of reliance on the medium
\par (b) the relative utility and limitations of the media in the dissemination of family planning information
\par (c) how variables like education and socio-economic status have an impact on message acceptance and if increased awareness guarantee acceptance of the message.

educating actual and potential parents regarding the benefits of smaller family sizes since the fertility of less educated women has been found to be higher than that of the educated ones.
\par <#/>There is need to communicate to the people by using the most ef
fective channels, where to obtain and raise awareness of the benefits and risks associated with different methods to different people. <#/>This can be done according to the peoples, level of education, dominant communication channel under use, religious a
ffiliation, cultural values, economic status and occupation.
\par <#/>Since the information content of an innovation is vital to the ultimate acceptance or rejection of an innovation; its essential that information of social change, for example the adoption of f
amily planning and birth control methods emanating from a dissimilar culture i.e western should be packaged adequately so that the target audience's traditional and religious values are kept in mind before the message is disseminated to the recipients.

\par <#/>Parents should be encouraged to talk to their children freely about family planning from an earlier age and not to wait till they have gone a stray before they advice them.
\par <#/>The

\par <#/>We use the word "pol

\par <h> <#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 Background to the Integration of Women in Development}{\fs24\lang2057  </h>
\par <#/>The major pre-occupation of most African countries between the 1950s and 1970s was to achieve political, psychological and economic independence. <#/>It is during this period that the South came to realize that the "aid" package from the Nort
h had done little to alleviate their poverty and if anything, the situation was getting worse. <#/>The South called for a restructuring of global economy, pointing out that they had also contributed to it in terms of labour and raw materials. <#/>This led
 
to the First United Nations (UN) Development Decade from 1960 to 1970. <#/>The second UN Development Decade (1970-1980) called for the redistribution of power and resources between the South and the North. <#/>In both the First and Second Development Deca
des, women's issues had not yet featured. <#/>Regarding this period, (Maquire, 1988: p. 9) writes: }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
For women, a common theme acts across the struggles. <#/>Whether it was independence, liberation movement or development, women learned that the changes were not intended for them.}{\b\fs24\lang2057 </X><quote/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Up till recent times, even social studies largely ignored the contribution of women to change and shape society alongside their male counterparts. <#/>Information that existed on women was based on questions asked
 of men about their wives, daughters, and sisters - not from the women themselves. <#/>The information on women was from a male perspective.
\par <#/>In 1970, Boserup made a pioneer analysis of women's economic activities in the developing world. <#/>Her conclu
sions indicated that despite the fact that women contributed greatly towards economic development, particularly in agriculture, this contribution was not reflected in national statistics, planning and implementation of development projects. <#/>She sugges

ed that it was modernization that was displacing women from traditional productive functions and thereby diminishing their income and status for her colonialism and neo-colonialism contributed to the decline of the status of women (Boserup, 1970) was emph
a
tic that unless those who make decisions on development strategies recognize and account for women's roles, the process of development would be less effective. <#/>The recognition that women's economic contribution is essential to the development process 
began to emerge thereafter. <#/>New approaches of Development Plans of "integrating women into development" were implemented. <#/>These approaches were developed by governments and donor agencies.
\par <#/>Women's groups were affected by the new approach. <#/>Si
nce the women's groups had for a long time been mobilized to deal with their own problems, they became easy victims for the new development approach. <#/>Both the state, and the donor agencies developed their own agenda for the women's groups. <#/>We will
 
continue with this discussion later in this chapter. <#/>In the meantime it is important to look at two theories - the industrial and critical approaches - that were developed either to support or criticize the idea and practice of integrating women into 
development. <#/>It is important to interpret the politics of women's groups within the two schools of thought.
\par <#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 The industrial theory}{\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>The focal point of the industrial approach is efficiency. <#/>The need to integrate women into development is based on the following arguments:

\par <#/>In principle, the Kenya Government has acce

i

c
ouraged to register with the Bureau for better planning and management of their activities. <#/>The Bureau has been cited as a catalyst inspiring women's groups to undertake entrepreneurial activities such as agricultural projects, small scale businesses,
 
making of handicrafts, and community improvement. <#/>Since the establishment of the bureau, there has been an increase in formation and resurgence of women's groups. <#/>Some of the groups registered with Women's Bureau have been provided with financial,
 material and technical assistance. <#/>The assistance includes: group and project management, project planning and evaluation, financial management, and leadership training.
\par <#/>Most of the initiatives aimed towards women's groups are usually external to t
he groups. <#/>Often the requirements of the donors, like those of the politicians, are defined without consultation with these groups. <#/>Although these efforts are meant to bring women into the mainstream of economic development, there has been very li

\par <#/>Every year the International Press Institute (IPI) and the like-minded Amnesty International, both based in the West, produce disturbing reports describing the increasingly parlous conditions in which journalists - especially i
n the Third World - are working. <#/>Such a grim report was used, for instance, at a 1983 meeting of representatives of the print and electronic media as the basis of another call - the umpteenth - on the governments of our world to leave the Press alone.
 
<#/>Sponsored by the US-based World Press Freedom Committee (WPFC), the conference of editors and publishers from the Western and Third Worlds, which took place in the French Alpine town of Talloires, shed many tears over the fact, as Flora Lewis later pu

\par <#/>Since then "government controls and harassment" have increased even more rapidly every year. <#/>This concern by Amnesty,
 the IPI and the WPFC is based on a stark and glaring fact, a fact I know from direct personal experience, having in my professional life as a journalist, been detained in police cells many times, both in Kenya and in Uganda, as a result of legitimate act
i
vities which, to me, appeared quite innocuous. <#/>The worrisome reality today, especially in Africa, Asia and Latin America, is that the journalist works through an extremely narrow straitjacket. <#/>Arrests and incarcerations take place day in and day o
u
t. <#/>Deaths are not infrequent. <#/>Self-censorship by editors, managers and owners of newspapers is, as a result, a normal recourse. <#/>Many intellectually honest journalists are banned altogether from writing. <#/>Where they remain on the staff of a 
newspaper, they are often sidelined or kept far away from all decision-making committees.
\par <#/>The continual pressure on governments to loosen their grip on the means of public information can justifiably be seen as a positive development; for, where press v
oices are muzzled, the myriads of problems which the Third World governments claim they are trying to solve cannot be reflected very clearly in a mirror for full identification and effective solutions.
\par <#/>Yet the newspaper editor appears incurably addicte
d to lifting himself way above society, from where he gives it the bird's-eye view and makes the avian motions of criticizing it, but only from the editor's own extremely narrow subjective armchair. <#/>He seems to say that his own right - nay, privilege 
-
 as an intellectual magistrate should have no limiting conditions whatever. <#/>His position should be protected at all costs, even to the detriment of other, often vastly more important, interests of the society in which he is writing. <#/>The editor is 
the absolute judge, inevitably pointing an accusing finger at everybody, every institution, everything. <#/>Like Jehovah Elohim, he is no respecter of persons. <#/>Like him, he is a god of wrath.
\par <#/>This tendency by editors and other int
ellectuals to rise high above society in order to be able to make what is only a most superficial critique of that society, is basically a self-serving one. <#/>It is what enables a journalist to pursue purely existential interests with an easy conscience

 <#/>Once the editor is seen to be taking society to task - but doing it in such a harmless manner that it is unlikely to upset society's basic foundations which, alone, ensure the editor's existential privileges - nobody is likely to accuse the editor of
 
being a social cover-up agent. <#/>That is why editors can continue to enjoy gross privileges and profligate life with quiet consciences. <#/>After all, don't we live in the wake of such highly revered publicists of Western fame as Colin Wilson, Ernest He
mingway, Gertrude Stein, Gunther Bl\'f6ker, Albert Camus and other imposing intellectual self-gratification divinities?
\par <#/>Whatever its real cause, this total abstraction from the rest of society of the problems which attend the Press has always had the effec
t of obscuring a fact which is increasingly forcing its way to the fore. <#/>It is that the frequent government clampdowns on or takeovers of all the instruments of propaganda are really the effect, not the cause, of the absence of other, profoundly more 
important social freedoms. <#/>The clampdowns and takeovers are but a symptom, an outer expression, a form of manifestation of other vastly more significant deficiencies in the fundament of society.
\par <#/>Yet it is the seemingly phenomenal aspects of society which interest those who report Third World events. <#/>They are simply mesmerized by the spectacular appearance of our <foreign/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 coups }{\fs24\lang2057 <foreign/>}{
\i\fs24\lang2057 d'etat, }{\fs24\lang2057 political assassinations, corruption, palace intrigues and <foreign/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 cherchez-la-femme}{\fs24\lang2057  - not to mentio
n our crop failures and frequent natural calamities. <#/>The dastardly activities of Idi Amin, Augusto Pinochet, Ferdinand Marcos and other "village tyrants" - as Denis Hills depicts them in }{\i\fs24\lang2057 The White Pumpkin}{\fs24\lang2057 
 -just enrapture David Lamb, John Gunther, Robert Ruark and other "special correspondents" from the other world.
\par <#/>With exquisite turns of phrase, they describe the "exoticism" of these tragedies with great minuteness and colour. <#/>But what runs through all their reports like a thread is that the Th
ird World is and can be attractive only as an oddity, a curio, a <foreign/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 rara }{\fs24\lang2057 <foreign/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 avis }{\fs24\lang2057 <foreign/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 in }{\fs24\lang2057 <foreign/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 
terra. <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 As Anthony Smith remarks with a sneer in }{\i\fs24\lang2057 The Geopolitics of Information: How Western Culture Dominates the World, }{\fs24\lang2057 the Western m
an is its forever-enchanted "observer". <#/>The correspondent is his binoculars, through the powerful lenses of which the rare birds behave as they have always behaved for the million years since their species appeared on the face of the earth. <#/>It is 
i
nvariably the same tragic story, the same childlike helplessness, the same internecine wars, the same dappled war paint, the same tribal song and dance, the same atavistic eroticism, the same superstitious unction! Yet nothing at all can be done to alter 
the conditions in which these rocs and dodos live because that is the way nature created the species. <#/>Nothing will ever change their generic unconcern for one another and for }{\i\fs24\lang2057 human }{\fs24\lang2057 progress.
\par <#/>What emerges, then, from this gloating over Third World ad
versities is that it is basically racist, at least at the sub-conscious level. <#/>Since the Third World is inhabited, by and large, by peoples of non-Caucasian strains, what the correspondent appears to be trying to convey by his knowing wink, his malici
o
us glee and his cut-of-cloth predictability in phraseology is that only the Caucasian race is capable of peace, orderliness and development. <#/>Never mind the German, French, British, Spanish, Italian and Yankee generals who ride roughshod over the Latin
 American peoples! Never mind the fact that these very same pale-faced "Men on Horseback" - as Edmund Burke recognized their ilk - organize more }{\i\fs24\lang2057 coups, }{\fs24\lang2057 
imprisonments and <-_genocides><+_genocide> every year than do African, Asian, Caribbean and South Pacific }{\i\fs24\lang2057 coup-}{\fs24\lang2057 makers put together!
\par <#/>What we find, then, is that poverty as a result of some five centuries of fleecing by the very same Western societies from which our correspondents come, and on whose behalf they write, is to a large measure the cause of Thi
rd World political hurly-burlies. <#/>What transpires is that the correspondents-whether they know it or not - are really serving as cover-up agents of the Western world's own crucial place in this protracted international scandal, this unprecedented crim
e against humanity.
\par <#/>If, therefore, the Western journalists' criticisms of the Third World consist of little more than sleazy denigration of what are only secondary aspects of something whose primary nature is far more profound, how can the correspondent
s even begin to be of any avail to Third World societies? <#/>Typical of this attitude towards the Third World is the annual IPI-WPFC jeremiad used as the launch for this chapter. <#/>It simply deprecates the persecution of journalists by Third World regi
m
es. <#/>This is, of course, a truism, but it is an already well-known truth. <#/>Were the correspondents really interested in helping the Third World to lift itself out of its social, economic and intellectual Slough of Despond, they would ask themselves 
a tell-tale
\par <#/>question: Why are human rights violations increasing in the Third World in the same proportion as the volume of Third World criticism by Amnesty and its friends increases?
\par <#/>The importance of that question should be obvious. <#/>Apart from
 pointing an accusing finger at the high-handedness characteristic of Third World regimes, Western critics would do us a hundred times more good by giving us a detailed historico-material explanation of that unfortunate phenomenon. <#/>Such an explanation
 
is what is not well-known. <#/>It is useful to draw attention to the fact that certain things happen, but it is a million times more useful to explain why they happen. <#/>Only if we know the causes of our catastrophes can we give them perennial solutions
.
 <#/>It would be distinctly more availing for correspondents to go beyond the Third World's phenomenal appearances and prove something which a growing number of Third World students are beginning emphatically to suggest. <#/>It is that this refusal on jou
r
nalists' part to examine the real social conditions which beget the muzzling of voices by the politicians - this preference to limit our criticisms to such symptomatic events as arresting and hurling dissidents or journalists into the dungeon can only pre
vent us from arriving at a correct social diagnosis and writing of a correct social prescription for our illnesses.
\par <#/>At any rate, if this kind of criticism continues to be couched in its present facile and yet suggestive language, it can only harden the 
conviction of our despots that a still bigger bludgeon is needed. <#/>This is, indeed, one of the answers to the question posed earlier - namely, why repression is being intensified despite the growing volume of criticism by Westerners.
\par <#/>The Western pub
licist's unwillingness - perhaps inability - to explain the world in causal terms, historically as well as internationally, expresses itself through the scribe's incurable predilection for lifting succulent facts out of their real contexts, thus unavoidab
l
y distorting or falsifying the whole picture. <#/>Because his penchant for "spot news" - that pet commodity of Ted Turner, Roger Tatarian, Gerald Long and other Western news merchants - is insatiable, he is a most successful <-pedlar> of fragmentation, ob
s
curantism, compartmentalization and ahistoricism of ideas. <#/>As Anthony Smith reports, it is the publicist who long ago created in his readers a sweet tooth for nuggets of information. <#/>Thus the correspondent always feels the duty to keep surfeiting 
h
is reader's increasingly demanding palate. <#/>These information <slang/>cuppas from the Third World are tasty beyond compare, despite the fact that the same fare has been served up again and again for many decades and even centuries. <#/>It matters littl
e
 that they are, at best, nugatory and contain next to no food value; at worst, they secrete a strong dose of addictive poison, that is, unless there is a better name for the slurs, tendentiousness or "vicious insinuationist" tone, as a Ghanaian newspaper 
used to say, which characterizes their copy.
\par <#/>The newspaper scribe vigorously defends the myths, bromides, stereotypes, preconceptions, misconceptions, ready-made conclusions and, not infrequently, deliberate falsifications concerning the Third World so 
as to get a dainty headline for the consumers. <#/>The Western editor never ceases to point out that this supply is what meets the "consumer public" demands. <#/>Since the journalist is the creator and sharpener of this consumer public "taste", the public
i
st is, by profession, a catastrophe-monger. <#/>He is confessing that he would be a sad man the day political tumult ended in the Third World. <#/>He is admitting to crass existentialism as a philosophy of life. <#/>He is unwittingly owning up to the char
ge that he is making money by selling mental pollution.
\par <#/>That being the case, what is the Western journalist's solution to the worsening conditions of political instability and repression in the Third World? <#/>Surely, he cannot be interested in a real 
solution because such a solution would block his source of livelihood. <#/>A number of Western correspondents based in Nairobi were heard to lament aloud when the tyrant Idi Amin was overthrown in 1979. <#/>Why? <#/>Because - they confessed - there would 
now be nobody colourful enough to provide them with ready and delicious copy! So, for a "solution," the Western editor gives nothing but an old Heath Robinson contraption! <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Third World leaders must work out constitutional "guarantees" and abide by them! He prescribes "democracy" with such alacrity one would think that everything else that might be needed to constitute a stable society were already firmly in place.
\par <#/>After so many years of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the assumption remains stronge
r than ever in Western capitals that the whole set of Western political ideas and institutions can simply be transported - lock, stock and barrel - and grafted onto non-Western societies without the lightest regard for anything else. <#/>The question is n
ever asked: Why have those ideas and institutions proved such utter failures in the Third World?
\par <#/>The reason why the Third World is in seemingly perpetual political turmoil and why its leaders are so afraid of public criticism can be described by one wor
d, poverty. <#/>This does not mean that Third World leaders are poverty-stricken. <#/>On the contrary, they are visibly some of the most opulent individuals in the world. <#/>To understand this paradox, it is necessary to realize that the leading stratum 
in the majority of Third World states is not a }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 naturally }{\v\fs24\lang2057 developed social class. <#/>It is an }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 artificial }{\v\fs24\lang2057 
class moulded by the colonial regime, for the purpose of acting, upon the departure of direct colonial rule, as the political and managerial overseer of
 Western property in all sectors. <#/>It is objectively impossible for such an artificial stratum to resolve the hundreds of ethnic disparities bequeathed by colonialism, and it is simple for various economic groups from the former colonizing country (and
 
other "Northern" countries for which independence has opened a floodgate of competition) to play the various factions against one another. <#/>The foreigners do this because they are for ever seeking to latch onto a faction that, in their opinion, would m
ost consistently safeguard their local stakes. <#/>This scenario has been ably illustrated by Frederick Forsyth in }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 The Dogs of War.}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
\par <#/>The result of this is well known. <#/>It is the cause of the extreme obsession by most Third World elites with their imag
e abroad (in the Western metropolises). <#/>They are acutely conscious of the fact that without stability in a country, the foreign investors cannot make any profit and that without profit, nothing can overflow from the investment as the elites' reward. <
#
/>Thus, even at the most blatant expense of their own people, many Third World states always try to please the foreign investors and donors over whose property they play the role of guard, hence the intense sensitivity with which every member of the strat
um - high or low - receives even the tamest public censure. <#/>Such thin skin stems from the fact that the <foreign/>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 nouveau }{\v\fs24\lang2057 <foreign/>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 riche, }{\v\fs24\lang2057 
unlike any naturally created social class, is a consumer class before everything else.
\par <#/>They have relatively li
ttle producer standing. <#/>This is because most of the important capital operating locally belongs to foreign monopoly houses. <#/>There is indeed some indigenous producer property (and often even the <foreign/>compradors have a stake in it), but this ca
n
 only thrive as long as it is subservient and not a threat to foreign corporate capital. <#/>An example of this phenomenon is Hilary Ng'weno's Stellascope company, which was strangled by loans from financial houses with interests connected with foreign co
rporations just as it was showing signs of greenness.
\par <#/>Though there is a daily attempt to cultivate a local political and economic base, this is rendered for ever difficult in the face of the hegemony of the transnational community. <#/>The position of t
hose who would like to create capital with a local base is, therefore, highly tenuous. <#/>Either they fail to survive or they are compelled to cultivate transnational ties which condemn them to the position of a perpetual loan receiver. <#/>If they seek 
to maintain independence and refuse to receive loans designed to moor them to the ground, there will be an all-out attack on them by expatriate firms.
\par <#/>Therefore, many prefer not to compete with the foreigners. <#/>The agents prefer to serve their foreig
n masters totally. <#/>This is why they are so keen to have a good press in Western capitals. <#/>The dependency syndrome of Third World elites, the obsession with their image abroad, their shaky political
\par <#/>ground and their consequent oversensitivity to criticism, have very debilitating consequences for local journalists. <#/>It is what is responsible for the daily incarcerations of journalists who happen to make }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 a }{
\v\fs24\lang2057 <foreign/>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 faux }{\v\fs24\lang2057 <foreign/>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 pas }{\v\fs24\lang2057 in their news collection, news processing and news management
 activities. <#/>Our elites' preoccupation with their image in London, Paris or Washington is so responsible for their frequent rushing of information to Western correspondents based locally immediately after they have denied local journalists that same i
nformation. <#/>Hence, the local journalist can never compete on equal terms with expatriate counterparts and must for ever be condemned to journalistic underdevelopment.
\par <#/>To put it in general terms, it is not the absence of constitutional "guarantees" t
hat is responsible for our crippling political attacks on the Press and other media of intellectual expression. <#/>On the contrary, it is the shaky economic and cultural ground on which our political systems stand - a ground paved by colonialism and main
t
ained by neo-colonialism - which is responsible for the sustained onslaughts on free expression. <#/>The lash-happy characteristic, especially of military regimes, thus, is not a cause but a consequence; the consequence of our economic poverty, cultural r
ootlessness, political dependency and intellectual stultification. <#/>In other words, the very same foreigners whose pressmen continually accuse us of the present mess in Africa are the ones responsible for our difficulties.
\par <#/>One can see that these acti
vities are not due to the fact that their perpetrators are non-Caucasian and, therefore, racially deficient. <#/>They are not due to the perpetual Western innuendo that Third World societies are genetically incapable of democracy and freedom. <#/>If that 
w
ere so, what would explain them in Latin America? <#/>It is becoming manifest that these Third World political volcanoes are inexorable consequences of five centuries of ruthless economic, cultural, political and mental emasculation of us by the North Atl
a
ntic. <#/>It is this international material order and power structure - now more ruthless than ever - which is responsible for our backwardness, our growth in a backward direction, in material terms as well as in terms of our inability to express our cond
itions and our aspirations with any knowledge, self-knowledge and clarity.

\par <#/>Understanding of the population situation in a spatio-tempor
al context is of paramount importance for not only national but also regional development planning processes. <#/>This concern underlines the need for collecting, compiling and publishing demographic data by national governments, particularly using variou
s
 sources of data. <#/>However, successful realisation of this objective has eluded many governments and the results tend to vary significantly from country to country in Sub-Saharan Africa. <#/>Analysis of the state of population in the two closely linked
 sub-regions, based on fragmentary data, makes the authors of this article tackle this subject with great trepidation.
\par <#/>Ideally, the state of population in Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) ought to be examined in the context of situational forces, conse
quences of demographic processes, realities or myths of population pressure and development planning policies and strategies deployed to redress population issues. <#/>Yet it is not possible to examine adequately this list of issues due to paucity and poo
r quality of data.
\par <#/>It should be emphasized that physical environmental factors of risks and utility shape demographic characteristics either directly or indirectly. <#/>Also, the socio-cultural milieu determines the nature of cultural norms and practice
s that influence demographic processes. <#/>Furthermore, effects of colonial political economy, which have lingered on in the post-independence development philosophy and planning strategies throughout the region, have unleashed measures that have serious
 repercussion on demographic levels and trend. <#/>All these variables need to be examined for a proper understanding and appreciation of the population situation in the region.
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 Data Availability and Reliability}{\fs24\lang2057  </h>
\par <#/>Data utilized to portray the
 state of population in this region have been assembled from various sources, namely official government publications and publications of United Nations agencies including the Economic Commission for Africa, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and resea
rch materials. <#/>Although these sources vary significantly in quality and reliability, they suffice for making broad generalisations regarding the population situation in the two subregions.
\par <#/>We observe that demographic statistics for Eastern and South
ern Africa share common features. <#/>First, historical development of data collection systems reflects racial bias in implementation of the apparatus, especially with regard to census and vital registration systems }{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Kuczynski, 1949)}{
\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>This practice sys
tematically created major data gaps for a spatio-temporal analysis of population size, trends and population dynamics. <#/>Second, ESA countries differ in the range of demographic variables on which data are collected, thereby rendering national as well a
s
 sub-regional comparison of demographic indices difficult. <#/>Finally, the countries differ in the completeness of spatial coverage. <#/>For example, countries in Southern Africa have emphasized collection of urban statistics relative to that of remote r
u
ral areas. <#/>Most governments in the two sub-regions therefore rely on estimates to derive essential demographic indices for planning purposes. <#/>This article therefore aims at portraying broad generalisations which could camouflage distinct regional 
variations in the state of population.
\par <#/>An impressive feature of ESA countries is that most of them have had several censuses which have generated some useful data; even Ethiopia and Somalia, which had never conducted any census for a long time, had cens
uses in the 1980s, although intensive war in the Horn of Africa has rendered census data <-/unviable>.
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 Variations in Population Size, Growth Rates and Trends}{\fs24\lang2057  </h>
\par <#/>According to the estimates by Population Reference Bureau }{\v\fs24\lang2057 (1993)}{\fs24\lang2057 , in 1993, the Af
rican continent had a total population of 677 million which represented 12.3% of the total world population. <#/>Both Eastern and Southern Africa sub-regions had approximately 258.4 million people who constituted 38.2% of the total population of the Afric
a
n continent. <#/>Further analysis indicates that Eastern Africa sub-region had a total population of 213.7 million or 82.7% of the entire population in Eastern and Southern Africa sub-regions. <#/>This indicates that Eastern Africa is more populous than S
outhern Africa.
\par <#/>Projected population for the year 2010 also indicates that the African continent will have a population aggregate of 1,081 million or 15.4% of the total world population. <#/>This projection implies an increase of 3.1% from 1993. <#/>Tab
le 1 suggests that, in the year 2010, Eastern and Southern Africa is projected to have approximately 420.5 million people or 38.9% of the total population in the African continent. <#/>This means that, by the year 2010, the share of the total continental 
p
opulation by Eastern and Southern Africa will increase by 0.7%. <#/>Further analysis reveals that, in the year 2010, Eastern Africa will have approximately 355.7 million inhabitants or 84.6% of the total projected population for Eastern and Southern Afric
a. <#/>This proportional share will also indicate an increasing trend of 1.9% between 1993 and 2010. 
\par <#/>Further scrutiny of Table 1 and Figure 1 permits certain generalisations to be made about regional pattern of population size and absolute growth trend
. <#/>First, a majority of countries will experience a very high population increase (more than 50%) between 1993 and 2010, ranging between 54% for Zimbabwe and 80% for Comoros. <#/>Second, some countries will experience relatively low population increase
 (less than 50%) between 1993 and 2010, ranging between 0% for Seychelles and 47% for Lesotho. <#/>Three countries categorised in this group, Seychelles, Mauritius and Reunion, are islands off the coastal zone of Eastern and Southern Africa.
\par <#/>These state
d generalisations do camouflage distinct inter- and intra-country differentials in absolute population change. <#/>It is further realised that Eastern and Southern Africa's share of the total global population is bound to increase by the year 2010, an upw
ard trend which will be more pronounced by the year 2025.
\par <#/>Turning to relative population growth as indexed by average annual population growth rate, Table 2 shows that, in the decade 1980 - 1990, annual population growth rate was steadily increasing for
 all countries except Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, Reunion, Seychelles, Somalia, Zimbabwe and South Africa. <#/>But, after 1990, more countries in the region started exhibiting a declining growth trend, with a few exceptions such as Mozambique, Seychelle
s and Somalia. <#/>Some nations exhibited no change in growth rates: namely Burundi, Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Lesotho and South Africa.
\par <#/>If the 1990 - 1995 average annual population growth rates are regarded as the base reference data, most ESA countri
es are projected to double their 1993 population sizes in two or three decades. <#/>Exceptions to these expected changes are Mauritius which will double its population size in the next 70 years, Reunion in 44 years and Seychelles in 41 years.
\par <#/>It should be pointed out that most Indian Ocean islands have completed their demographic transitions and have characteristics similar to those of the developed countries.
\par }\pard\plain \s16\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \v\lang2057 {\v0 <#/>Factors contributing to these population growth levels and trends: will be identified when
 three parameters of population dynamics, namely fertility, mortality and migration, are individually discussed later. <#/>Note also that, in almost all countries, urban growth rates are nearly doubling the average population growth rates, as portrayed by
 Table 2. 
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang1031 {\fs24 <h> <#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 Pattern of Population Distribution and Density}{\fs24\lang2057  </h>
\par <#/>Though population density per squaw kilometre is often regarded as a crude measure of man-land relationship, it is still considered a useful index for gauging population pressure in 
the absence of more robust indices. <#/>Reference to Figure 2, showing the spatial pattern of population distribution and density in 1980 for Eastern and Southern Africa, indicates that pockets of extremely high population density with over 100 persons pe
r
 square kilometre were as follows: Ethiopian Highlands; Kenyan Highlands; the shores of Lake Victoria in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania; the North-Eastern shores of Lake Tanganyika; the Southern shores of Lake Malawi; the Zambian copper-belt region; and the R
and region in South Africa. <#/>Further details on arithmetic population density and average cropland per capita in hectares are given in Table 3.
\par <#/>Available cropland per capita in hectares is a superior index of man-land relationship. <#/>This informati
on reveals that seven countries in the region, namely Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, Rwanda, Somalia, Tanzania and Lesotho, were experiencing critical population pressure in 1990. <#/>Five other countries, namely Burundi, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Malawi and Z
i
mbabwe, were also experiencing serious population pressure. <#/>Conclusively, 12 out of 17 countries in the region, for which data are available, are facing an acute man-land ratio, a problem largely confounded by arithmetic population density. <#/>Physio
logical population density (persons per km2 of arable land) for ESA countries depicts an even grimmer picture (Table 3).
\par <#/>The observed state of man-land relationship is attributed to rapid natural increase of population and the influence of net immigrati
on. <#/>Both Eastern and Southern Africa sub-regions have experienced phenomenal influx of refugees caused by forces of political insecurity and elements of ecostress.
\par <#/>Further reference to inter- and intra-country variations in population distribution 
and density reveals that forces of ecostress, comprising physical environmental hazards such as drought, famine, floods and disease epidemics which are cyclic and rampant in the region, determine largely regional variations in population density. <#/>Larg
e portions of the region consist of arid and semi-arid lands (ASAL) such as seen in Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Botswana, Namibia and parts of South Africa. 
\par <#/>It is noted that rural-to-rural migration and rural-to-urban migration reinforc
e current spatial variations in population density. <#/>Migrations for rural settlement including agricultural land colonisation or for wage employment in urban areas as well as in "economic islands of development" such as mining centres and large-scale p
l
antation farms, continue to stimulate population relocation. <#/>Also, government development policies, aiming at restructuring development in the agricultural sector or rectifying rural-urban imbalances in development, contribute to spatial differences i
n
 population density. <#/>Such policies include Kenya's District Focus for Rural Development (DFRD) strategy and the agricultural modernisation programmes in Zimbabwe and Zambia. <#/>To recapitulate, the current spatial pattern of population distribution a
n
d density in Eastern and Southern Africa still mirrors the legacy of colonial administration which demarcated the entire region into different political spheres of influence and ethnic territories. <#/>Southern Africa sub-region, in particular, has its sp
atial pattern of population distribution and density engraving the imprints of }{\i\fs24\lang2057 Apartheid }{\fs24\lang2057 
policy which attained its climax of absurdity by the creation of "Tribal Homelands" or "Bantustans", soon expected to disappear in the majority-ruled South Africa. <#/>
Current waves of "ethnic cleansing" and resurgence of refugee movement and internal displacements of population are a living testimony of the yoke of colonialism that continue to influence spatial patterns of population density.
\par <#/>Yet arithmetic populati
on density described above understates the problem of population pressure which engulfs Eastern and Southern Africa. <#/>Table 3 shows that physiological population density depicts a much grimmer picture than arithmetic population density, with countries 
such as Kenya, Mauritius and Rwanda experiencing very high population pressure on arable land.
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 Variations in Fertility and Contraceptive Prevalence}{\fs24\lang2057  </h>
\par <#/>The foregoing analysis of regional variations in absolute and relative population changes (g
rowth) and the consequent spatial patterns of population distribution and density are better understood and appreciated when regional patterns of crude birth rates, total fertility rates, crude death rates and infant mortality indices are examined. 

\par <#/>Re
ference to Table 4 and Figure 3 reveals that, between 1978 and 1985, increase in crude birth rate (CBR) occurred in Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Somalia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Lesotho. <#/>The other countries experienced a decline or no change in CBR
.
 <#/>But, between 1985 and 1993, fewer countries, namely Burundi, Ethiopia, Mauritius, Reunion, Uganda and South Africa, experienced an increase in crude birth rate, as the remaining countries experienced CBR decline or no change. <#/>In 1993, countries w
ith low crude birth rates were Mauritius, Reunion, Seychelles, Botswana, Lesotho and South Africa. <#/>On the other hand, countries with high crude birth rates were Malawi, Somalia and Uganda.
\par <#/>The scenario portrayed by total fertility rate (TFR) is not 
very different (Table 4). <#/>Between 1984 and 1993, total fertility rate declined for eleven countries in the region, namely Kenya, Mauritius, Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland. <#/>One country, Ma
d
agascar, showed no change in total fertility rate, and other countries experienced an increase in the level of their fertility. <#/>In 1984, the lowest total fertility rate was registered by Reunion and the highest total fertility rate was recorded by Ken
