is attitude is a reflection of the scholar's attitude towards Oral Literature as a subject and its creators who are not members of the elite. <#/>It is, in my view, also a demonstration of the influence of the traditional approaches to the study of the su
bject and our acceptance of those theories despite our verbal dismissal of them.

The traditional theories have suggested that narratives are less complex, need less specialization in terms of composition and even the community's assessment of them is le
ss specialised (Finnegan 1970:316). <#/>This has led scholars to believe that since anybody can tell stories, we can safely ignore the art or originality of the individual composers and creative artists.
\par <#/>The other major reason that has led to the disre
gard of the oral artists is the evolutionist notion of collective creation of narratives. <#/>The idea that you cannot trace any narrative to the influence of any individual great men or women has also led to this neglect. <#/>We note with Finnegan}{
\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  (op.cit.) }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 that these approaches have implications in the study of this subject. <#/>It means that: }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <quote_><X_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
the aspect of individual originality and authorship could be played down or rather the question of authorship not ever raised (p.318}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 )</X>}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <quote/>.}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
\par <#/>The scholars that refer to oral narratives as }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 survivals }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
also indicate that there is therefore no need to apply the normal procedures of critical evaluation or even to relate these survivals to a social literary background.
\par }\pard\plain \s94\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \f16\lang1031 {\f0\lang2057 <#/>This attitude is clearly refle
cted in our collections of the narratives as is shown in Chesaina (1991), Kabira & Mutahi (1988), Kieti & Coughlin (1990), and Kipury (1983), among others. <#/>It is not uncommon to find synopses, incomplete stories, undeveloped stories, contradictory con
flicts and resolutions, unresolved conflicts, loose ends, and motifs without conflicts among others.

\par <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 We seem to be totally unaware of the fact that the aesthetic product only comes from the contemporary t
eller and not from the remote past. <#/>We are in a hurry to reward these survivals because we believe that story telling is dying and at the end of it we end up with materials that cannot be subjected to literary criticism, since the material is of quest
ionable quality and there is little artistry. <#/>Yet we keep writing about the great quality of oral narratives and oral literature in general as that of }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 flexibility and unfixed quality }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
and the artist's ability to use the freedom she has to bind together e
pisodes, motifs, characters, and so forth. <#/>We have by and large ignored the living and creative art of the individual narrators. <#/>We are unclear about what to expect of a storyteller.

literature, and the need to preserve materials rather than the promotion and nurturing of the artists themselves. <#/>This reminds me of a question I asked Warukenya in 1990 and the answer she gave me. <#/>It went as follows:

resolutions, among others. <#/>These ideas still hold but in this chapter a new dimension is added to the analysis.

 sector of African economies. <#/>In a continent where over 70 per cent of the population remains rural, this factor cannot be over-emphasized. <#/>Women provide the bulk of the labour required for day to day management of farms. <#/>This includes plantin
g
, weeding, harvesting and the processing of agricultural produce. <#/>In more ways than one, women's prime responsibility, that of perpetuating their societies by providing food, is an intricate process that straddles various environmental factors. <#/>Wh
e
ther as pastoralists, cultivators or both, women have to deal with land, fuelwood and water on a daily basis in their efforts to feed their families. <#/>However, the process of feeding their families is mediated through a whole set of precolonial and col
o
nial property (primarily land) and power positions. <#/>Hence, to understand the role of women in production, consumption and distribution, all of which revolve around the proper utilization of the available natural resources, it is necessary to address s

<#/>For example, what is the locus of women within the wider questions of access to land, its ownership and management? <#/>These questions are only beginning to receive attention among researchers, government agencies and various categ
ories of extension workers. <#/>To a large extent, this has been sparked off by a series of related phenomena that have plagued Africa. <#/>In a debt-ridden continent struggling to implement crippling structural adjustment programmes, the spread of desert
i
fication is only rivalled by the prevailing food crisis. <#/>Out of the horrendous accounts of famines and deaths, the intricate network of factors that have produced the vicious cycle of poor economic systems and fragile environments is slowly beginning 
to unfold. <#/>The current fear, that in 1990 the Ethiopian famine of the 1980s will repeat itself, is apparent amidst a flurry of academic, governmental and international concern to piece together vital data that will avert crisis.
\par <#/>Despite the shifting
 fortunes of nations and the rapid deterioration of the ecological balance, women have remained a visible constant, maintaining an intimate interaction with the primary natural resources. <#/>In Africa, women continue to be the principal drawers of water,
 hewers of wood and cultiva\-
tors. <#/>In most African societies women also participate in the hunting of small game and the gathering of wild berries and edible root crops. <#/>In this respect then, women related and continue to relate closely to all the major natural resources.

\par <#/>Women in precolonial Kenya possessed an intricate and scientifically sound knowledge to manage their environment competently. <#/>Within the limits of their defined rights of access and utilization, women managed to maintain a wo
rkable balance between drawing sustenance from the land and allowing for the regeneration of it. <#/>Neither cultivation nor grazing was haphazard. <#/>Soil types, crop suitability and climatic regimes were all carefully balanced toward possible maximizat
ion of production and maintenance of the ecological system. <#/>Quite obviously the level of technological advancement was a major hindrance. <#/>The colonial period precipitated drastic changes.
\par <#/>The alienation of land, the creation of reserves, male la
bour migrancy and population growth all served to restructure generations of agricultural practices. <#/>In many ways, colonialism was about the restructuring of boundaries and access to resources. <#/>It was also about the redefinition of production, pow
er and wealth.
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 The precolonial situation}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  </h>
\par <#/>In precolonial Kenya, a system of rational fallow shifting cultivation was used. <#/>This allowed farmers to open up new fields every four or five seasons, leaving the old one to lie fallow. <#/>This
 way, two birds were killed with one stone. <#/>The farmer was able to get a good crop while land left fallow regenerated itself. <#/>The utilization of land was neither haphazard nor unscientific. <#/>There existed an intimate knowledge of soil types and
 
their sustainability for different crops. <#/>Women were entitled to demand that a husband provide fields that included the different soil types. <#/>This way women would be in a position to grow a variety of crops, some of which required specific soil ty
p
es. <#/>This intimate knowledge of the relationship between soil types and crop yields is corroborated by Kenyatta in his treatise on Kikuyu agricultural practices. <#/>Writing on the cultivation of yams, sugarcane and bananas, Kenyatta observed that <quo
te/> }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 'These are not crops that everyone [could] afford to grow on account of the suitable soil and water they require'}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>This applied to a host of other crops.

Intercropping and crop rotation ranked high among the carefully thought out agricultural practices. <#/>While both rotation and intercropping ensured that different crops drew different nutrients fr

aintained. <#/>The colonial period, however, did not always enhance this mutual interdependence. <#/>Literature on colonial exploitation of the African environment remains thin. <#/>Reckless hunting, lumbering and 'hoarding' of massive pieces of land all 
a
dded up to the creation of a fragile environment. <#/>In Kenya, the colonial government viewed shifting cultivation as wasteful and embarked on a process of re-organizing both the system of agriculture and land tenure systems. <#/>The resultant changes in
c
luding the individualization (maleization) of tenure, the alienation of land and the commoditization of agriculture did not augur well for women and the land. <#/>As for pastoralists, especially the Maasai, their undertaking was deemed uneconomic, justify

plus, negotiated in a previously non-cultivating set-up? <#/>How did this alter or fit into the group's system of utilization of land?
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \f16\fs20\lang1031 {\f0\lang2057 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 In Kenya, the alienation of 7.5 million acres of high potential land for European settlers had drastic effects on Afri
cans. <#/>For a start, it resulted in a growing shortage of land in African reserves, especially in Central Province. <#/>Amongst the Maasai who lost the largest portions of land, access to vital salt licks, dry season grazing and watering places all play
e
d havoc with pastoralism. <#/>The same was true of the Nandi and Tugen, among other cattle keepers. <#/>In the ensuing commoditization of land and commercialization of agriculture, women found themselves increasingly marginalized in their agricultural and
 
domestic activities. <#/>In many ways they found it difficult to maintain any meaningful control of their access to and utilization of available natural resources. <#/>Expansion in commodity production necessarily resulted in an expansion of women's labou
r hours as they sought to combine subsistence and commodity production with myriads of domestic chores.
\par <#/>This expansion in commodity production did not always result in increased access to the proceeds of their labour. <#/>Cash crops were men's crops. <#
/>Agricultural labour, however, remained largely female in composition. <#/>In Kenya, the expansion of peasant production had an additional negative impact on women. <#/>The constant use of rapidly decreasing landholdings resulted in the depletion of the 
f
ertility of the soil. <#/>This problem was compounded by overgrazing. <#/>Thus the re-organization of peasant production to meet metropolitan demands during the colonial period played havoc with the environment. <#/>The precolonial fallow and shifting cul
t
ivation could no longer be implemented. <#/>Land was in short supply. <#/>Even where it was possible to practise shifting cultivation, the fallow period became shorter and shorter as landholdings decreased over time due to constant subdivision. <#/>Under 
s
uch circumstances, women were forced to re-organize their patterns of agricultural farming. <#/>Crop rotation and intercropping were no longer options that were easily workable. <#/>The balancing effect that intercropping had on soil nutrients was obliter
a
ted with the abandonment of the practice. <#/>Women had to make difficult choices between fast-growing but less nutritious crops that were newly introduced and older more nutritious and more labour-consuming crops. <#/>That was the choice that many Kenyan
s had to make with regard to millet and sorghum, which gave way to maize, a more extractive and de\-
structive crop. <#/>Although maize could be intercropped with a variety of crops, women were also faced with the cultivation of cash crops which were neither 
edible or intercroppable with any of their common staples. <#/>Cotton, tobacco, wattle and groundnuts represent such categories of crops. <#/>Wattle trees were particularly notorious for their aggravation of soil erosion largely because they choke the und
e
rgrowth and fail to prevent the washing away of top soil during the rains. <#/>By and large, wattle trees were men's crops. <#/>They were the kind of crops which men could plant, leave them under women's care and return after a couple of years to collect 
t
he proceeds of their sale. <#/>Their bark was vital for the making of tannin, while their wood could be sold as fuelwood or burned into charcoal, both of which fetched good prices. <#/>In this as in other cases involving men's crops, women might witness t
he deterioration of family land without being in a position to do much to ameliorate the situation. <X_><#/>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
In this context, the role of women in the management of the environment in Kenya can only be reasonably understood if examined within domestic, socie
tal and the wider colonial power positions. <#/>Women were soon trapped in a situation where staple and cash crops competed for land and women's labour. <#/>While the land deteriorated and crop yields fell, women's worlds became all the more constricted. 
<
#/>In many respects, the colonial period decreased women's rights over the management of family holdings. <#/>It has been observed that amidst increasing land shortage, peasant farmers were forced to plant maize on steep slopes. <#/>The cultivation of suc
h fragile land portrayed women as land-miners, insensitive to or unwilling to adopt improved methods of agriculture.
\par <#/>Soil erosion from overcropping was compounded by overgrazing. <#/>Cattle held important economic, religious and socio-cultural significa
nce to a majority of African groups, both pastoral and agricultural. <#/>They were the medium of a host of social, religious and economic transactions. <#/>The payment of bridewealth, circumcision fees, fines for misdemeanour and ritual slaughtering for a
 
host of rites were all mediated through livestock. <#/>For these reasons, people kept large herds of livestock. <#/>In the period before the onset of colonization, there was no shortage of land. <#/>There was a well-worked-out system of land management wh
i
ch ensured that no permanent damage was done to the land. <#/>For example, among the Maasai of Kenya, a life of transhumance ensured a synchronization of seasons and the availability of prime pasture. <#/>Prophylactic measures were observed through a proc
e
ss of burning the grass so often. <#/>As well as ensuring the growth of fresh pasture, dangerous ticks were eliminated. <#/>The ashes from the burnt grass reintroduced useful minerals into the soil. <#/>Where did women fit into all this? <#/>To allow for 
the extensive movements, women and children remained behind in the, }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>}{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 manyattas, }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
the Maasai homesteads. <#/>They kept with them a limited number of cattle for the provision of dairy needs. <#/>Maasai women were themselves cattle owners in their own right
. <#/>Upon marriage their own parents gave them a number of cattle, especially cows in milk to ensure that they would be well provided for during their initial stay in a 'foreign' environment. <#/>Here, however, they were expected to fit into the general 
M
aasai lifestyle, looking after limited numbers of livestock, while their menfolk ventured further afield in search of less fragile environments. <#/>In this protective exercise, as in others, these women participated in the wholesome management of the env
ironment.
\par <#/>The 1930s and 1940s were characterized by what resembled a colonial obsession with soil conservation measures. <#/>Frantic efforts to mobilize rural populations toward this effort ultimately <-/focussed> on women. <#/>However, as decisions wer
e being made regarding the logistics of dealing with the fragile ecological imbalance, women who were the central labour force were left out of the deliberations. <#/>As Throup observed, the colonial government attempted 'to revive traditional land author
i
ties' by recruiting male clan leaders to enforce soil conservation measures. <#/>Like the colonial governments, these village patriarchs were insensitive to the intricate web of the lives of peasant women. <#/>In a set up where exhausted land could no lon
g
er be left fallow and virgin land was non-existent, women walked a tight-rope in their attempt to meet the demands of commercial and domestic production. <#/>This state of affairs was particularly rife during the Second World War. <#/>A good proportion of
 
the male population was away for various forms of war service; at the same time, increased production to meet war demands ushered in more than good prices. <#/>More importantly, it stretched women's working hours and overtaxed the land. <#/>In the period 
immediately after the war women were faced with rigorous efforts to remedy the damage created by developments beyond their control.
\par <#/>Remedial soil conservation measures, including broad and narrow bench terracing, intercropping and the reafforestation of
 hilly slopes, created much more work than the colonial government anticipated. <#/>In those areas where there was male labour <-/outmigration>, the situation became potentially explosive, for example, in Murang'a District where close to 50 per cent of me
n were short-term migrant labourers. <#/>By the mid-1940s, soil conservation tasks largely fell on women. <#/>This situation was not unique to Murang'a; it was reproduced all over the country.
\par <#/>Colonialism had sought to incorporate men into new patterns 
of life including waged labour, urban dwelling and formal education, largely to the exclusion of women. <#/>With the exception of Mau Mau, the soil erosion crisis created a classic battle of wits between the colonial state and women. <#/>After the initial
 co-operation, women refused to accept the colonial straightjacket that strained their lives beyond measure and did not seem to yield immediate benefits.
\par <#/>The additional soil conservation work did not pay due regard to women's reproductive and productive
 labour. <#/>Furthermore, the back-breaking conservation work was being enforced by insensitive and harsh elders who became the unofficial retainers of the colonial state. <#/>This brought to the fore the whole situation of control of women in colonial Ke
n
ya. <#/>The multi-tiered patriarchal set up in which women operated in precolonial Kenya was compounded by the imposition of an additional tier of male African and European authority figures. <#/>Colonial chiefs hovered between clan elders and British adm
i
nistrators, entrusted with the task of overseeing soil conservation measures. <#/>They were the link between 'the people' and 'the government'. <#/>This pitted women against three forces, all determined to ensure that the conservation of the land was enfo
rced. <#/>The reputation of each of the three was at stake. <#/>Women became pawns in larger power struggle as the crisis unfolded.
\par <#/>Various studies have underscored how various categories of 'change agents' have continued to overlook women even in those
 areas where women were the key participants. <#/>With regard to soil conservation measures, women's defiance was a statement against lack of consultation and ill-advised attempts to incorporate them in the salvaging of an environment they had done much t
o
 try and save but which efforts were continually destroyed by a combination of externally orchestrated developments. <#/>For example, the creation of African Reserves in the 1920s automatically curbed spatial expansion amidst a rapidly-expanding populatio
n. <#/>The resultant congestion could only have detrimental effects on the land.
\par <#/>The significance of the earlier land alienation only becomes clear when one realizes that only 10 per cent of Kenya's total land is arable. <#/>The rest is desert and semi-
desert territory. <#/>Hence, settlers occupied close to 50 per cent of all the arable land or up to 20 per cent of the most fertile land in the country. <#/>Conflict over what came to be known as the stolen lands and the subsequent shortages of land culmi
nated in the outbreak of the Mau Mau war for liberation, 1952-1956. <#/>In the mean time, the colonial government's refusal to address itself to the root cause of the problem\emdash land shortage\emdash 
 translated itself into the soil conservation match between colonial
 administrators and their retainers on the one hand, and peasant women on the other. <#/>Both the colonial administrators and their African retainers feared that women's non-compliance might 'lead to a landslide in government authority\rquote .

 both men and women were getting exasperated by the late 1940s. <#/>The government demanded that women offer their labour three mornings a week for communal terracing and grass planting activities. <#/>For many reasons, women were opposed to a project whi

h was otherwise deemed beneficial. <#/>For example, women's plots had to wait while they undertook communal work. <#/>Chiefs' and headmen's plots were given priority in the reclamation work. <#/>The colonial government failed to negotiate the manner in wh
i
ch the management of the environment would be enforced. <#/>While various forms of communal organization had served effectively in the execution of a diversity of chores in precolonial Kenya, rapid individualization of production begged a negotiation of c
ommunal labour, even for soil conservation.

 were terraced before women finally laid their tools down. <#/>For example, in Murang'a between 1945 and 1947 a total of 7,086 miles of terraces were built.
 <#/>These narrow-based terraces helped reclaim 24,000 acres of land. <#/>Soil conservation work was in progress in Machakos, Kitui, Embu and Southern Nyeri districts. <#/>In Western and Nyanza provinces soil conservation programmes were as equally daunti
n
g if not as sensational as in Central Province. <#/>In western Kenya, especially in the hilly Kakamega region, it was anticipated that close to 40,000 acres of land would be reafforested. <#/>Apart from the obvious reduction of land for cultivation, it wa
s
 feared that reafforestation might interfere with traditional land tenure. <#/>This, together with tensions surrounding authority structures in the implementation of the programme, delayed the project considerably. <#/>Here, as in other parts of the count
ry, the harsh behaviour of the enforcement agents towards peasants was widespread. <#/>In the Kakamega area soil conservation work was referred to as <ea/>}{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 Onyo, }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 a Swahili word for 'warning'.
\par <#/>Before long, however, women could no longer continue to combin
e their public and private duties. <#/>Their backs were breaking and on the 14th of April 1948, '2,500 women arrived in the District Commissioners station from chief Paterson's location and danced and sang and informed everyone that they would not take pa
rt in soil conservation measures mainly because they felt they had enough work to do at home\rquote .
\par <#/>Earlier, as part of a wider political campaign the Kenya African Union, the sole country-wide political party had called upon women to abandon terracing. <#/>
Like the women, these political leaders saw soil conservation as a cosmetic remedy which overlooked the real problem, land shortage. <#/>Attempts to remedy the situation under the Carter Land Commission were considered feeble. <#/>Land offered was insuffi
cient, both in terms of size or suitability for agricultural purposes. <#/>To some extent, conservation ate into land that was already sparse.
\par <#/>In this as in other acts of protest, women's decisions were portrayed as the results of male prompting and ins
tigation. <#/>The fallacy of this argument especially in the conservation protest is evidenced by the fact that at the bottom of the conservation project was the issue of land productivity. <#/>The women had every reason to support any project which might
 
enhance their food production efforts. <#/>The regeneration of land would ease their lot in more ways than one. <#/>For example, firewood which was a basic need had become difficult to collect because of the extensive clearing of land for cultivation. <#/
>However, what was at stake was more intricate. <#/>Their survival and the production of staple crops had been subordinated to an intricate and de\-
structive network of colonial and capitalist processes. <#/>This included commodity production. <#/>Some of th
is production, including the planting of wattle trees, was partially responsible for the expansion of soil erosion. <#/>At another level women had to contend with drastically reduced landholdings which put pressure on production for domestic consumption. 
<
#/>In this, as in other crises, women felt manipulated. <#/>Men, both local and foreign, seemed united in expanding women's working hours without increasing their access to the proceeds of the sales or increasing their powers over the management of the la
nd. <#/>In defying the colonial government, the women of Central Province also defied local patriarchs who enforced colonial legislation.
\par <#/>Hoping to coerce women back to the conservation project, the DC of Murang'a 'ordered the arrest of these recalcitra
nt women' on May 4,1948. <#/>In the ensuing scuffle the arrested women were quickly released by a large crowd of their own sex brandishing sticks and shouting Amazonian war cries. <#/>What the DC referred to as 'a large crowd of angry women' was a group t
h
at questioned the decades of colonial policy which had resulted in the destruction of an environment and had turned to the victims, blaming them for the calamity and enforcing brutal remedial measures. <#/>In an earlier confrontation between the Kamba and
 
the colonial state in the 1938-1939 destocking campaign, women had joined men in the march to Nairobi demanding to see the governor in a protest against forced destocking. <#/>The latter had been introduced by the government in an attempt to arrest soil e
rosion in Machakos which was blamed on overgrazing.
\par <#/>In an age that was characterized by individual production and capital accumulation, communal soil conservation work was very unpopular. <#/>As a concession to women's protest, the colonial government c
onceded to demands for individual terracing. <#/>This way, women could arrange their work schedules around their domestic, agricultural and terracing chores within the vicinity of their homes and gardens.
\par <#/>The above confrontation between women, the colonial state and its retainers over the issue of soil conservation belies other widespread projects in which women played key roles in the colonial reforestation efforts. <#/>Under the colonial }{
\f0\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 Shamba system, colonial forest squatters were allowed to cl
ear land, plant trees and intercrop these with common staples. <#/>As well as tending the trees, forest squatter families were able to utilize the cleared land until the tree canopies had closed. <#/>This would require the opening up of new lands and repe
ating the process all over. <#/>As key agriculturalists, women were active participants in this reforestation programme. <#/>Table 1.1 gives an idea of the extent of female involvement in the management of forests in colonial Kenya.
\par <#/>Both in precolonial 
and colonial Kenya, women developed a close and intimate relationship with forests. <#/>They obtained firewood, medicinal plants, berries, roots and other forms of raw materials. <#/>Their dependence on forests contradicts the attempt to portray women as 
forest users only.

<#/>For the majority of the rural and urban poor of Africa, the current degradation of the environment threatens their very livelihood. <#/>Crop failures in the past have resulted in disastrous famines. <#/>The com

Development in a situation like the Kenyan one is a multi-faceted process. <#/>In the last 25 years virtually everyone in the country has been involved in a churning sea of social, cult
ural and economic changes. <#/>The institutions and individuals with the responsibility to govern and direct the planned aspects of development are faced with situations and particular problems which are as practically and pragmatically urgent as they are
 
amorphously transitional with elusive human and cultural dimensions. <#/>These problems include what may be called high level issues such as the actual forging of the nation and the concomitant development of nationalism, the designing of appropriate mach
i
nery and institutions for government and the mobilization of national resources and evolution of appropriate policies for development. <#/>The low level practical issues include what should be taught in the formal educational system, by whom, where and ho
w
; the provision of health services; improvement of child nutrition in specific socio-cultural cases; or more generally the management or improvement of specific issues with respect to specific sectors of the society. <#/>For ease of reference, the high le
vel issues can be deemed policy and the low level }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 pragmatics.}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
\par <#/>This division between policy and pragmatic levels is artificial in many ways. <#/>There is a natural relationship between the two levels. <#/>The two have an obvious convergence in the ultima
te goal of the policy. <#/>For instance, it might be a high level policy matter to create an awareness and commitment to a united Kenya. <#/>Whether the goal is realized or not depends directly on low level practical matters designed to help achieve the g
o
al. <#/>This for example would include the issue of who teaches what, when and how. <#/>It might be a high level policy issue to enhance the foreign currency reserves and generally improve the economy of Kenya. <#/>The actual success or failure of that, g
oal will depend on lower level commitment to helping the <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Jua }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Kali }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
industrialist identify and manufacture appropriate items for export or assisting the horticultural farmer to enhance and improve his crop yield for export. <#/>It might be a high le
vel policy to eradicate disease, but the success or failure (though partially dependent on more technical matters such as availability of drugs}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 , }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
hospitals and even doctors) depends on the pragmatic levels of efficiency in the actual treatment of patients; 
the administration of drugs, the observation of <-_doctors><+_doctors'> instructions on various treatment regimes, the understanding of causes of various conditions and therefore how to avoid them and public awareness and commitment to matters of hygiene 
and nutrition. <#/>This relationship between policy and pragmatics can be represented as in Figure 7. 1.
\par <#/>The identification of a problem demands a policy, the desired goals dictate the policy and the pragmatics determine the success or failure in the ac
hievement of the goal. <#/>This might be called the chain of development. <#/>Whereas all the points in the chain of development are significant, the pragmatic level particularly stands out as the level at which understanding and effective management of t
he status quo takes place.
\par <#/>In other words, to identify a problem or an issue one must have some reference to the lower if not lowest end of the issue - the grassroots as it were.
\par <#/>There are, of course, intermediate levels between the so-called policy
 level and the pragmatic level. <#/>But, as envisaged here, the end of the pragmatic level is the grassroots where the relevant problem affects the individual, the community or a specific area with the totality of its ecology, including hu\-
manity. <#/>Afte
r the issue is identified, the policy formulation, no matter how broad, would aim at affecting the individual. <#/>The execution of a programme really involves the management and manipulation of the prevailing factors of the situation. <#/>Again the most 
concrete end is the lowest end of the pragmatics.
\par <#/>What is required at the end of a development programme will naturally depend on the details of the specific issue. <#/>But human societies are as a species wise and egocentric. <#/>So eventually, the ult
imate beneficiary of a development programme is society. <#/>More specifically the success of any development programme is a measure of how it helps improve the quality and quantity of the individual life. <#/>Ultimately, every development (programme) has
 an initiator (planner), target (beneficiary) and goal (objectives). <#/>The achievement of the goal calls for the participation of a beneficiary, recipient and catalyst.
\par <#/>Of course, just as the initiator and the target can overlap in many ways, so can t
he beneficiary, the recipient and the catalyst. <#/>The distinction between the beneficiary and the recipient need further comment. <#/>One must distinguish between <-/benefitting> from and receiving the benefits of a programme. <#/>For instance, an infan
t
 population may be targeted as the beneficiary of a programme but it cannot be a recipient in the sense used here because infants do not have the capacity to actively receive what is offered by way of advice, new techniques or tools. <#/>A recipient is th
us a target for development and has a capacity to choose to benefit from what is offered.
\par <#/>In this chapter the rural women farmers are studied as a target group (or part thereof) for development of agriculture and food production. <#/>The group is deeply
 involved as the beneficiary, recipient and major catalyst. <#/>Women form the majority of the rural population in Kenya. <#/>By virtue of their role in the home and household, they are responsible for the day to day running of the domestic unit which inc
l
udes the provision and management of food. <#/>They are therefore the most immediate sufferers when there is food shortage and happy beneficiaries when they have plenty to manage. <#/>By virtue of division of labour and the concomitant socio-cultural resp
onsibilities, they (at least in Siaya) are most immediately involved in agriculture and farm production. <#/>They are directly responsible for the cultivation, harvesting and storage of the food grown.
\par <#/>The study specifically concerns itself with the rol
e of language in communicating agricultural development strategies to women who are the best placed to do whatever needs to be done to improve farming. <#/>As far as is known the innovations and desired improvements in the area under study are basically t
h
e concern of the government. <#/>The government has attempted to facilitate development in this area through Ministry of Agriculture rural veterinary and agricultural services. <#/>The most notable link between the government as the initiator and the rura
l}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
women farmers are Agricultural Extension Officers who are expected to serve the rural farmers at their homes in a grassroots approach. <#/>Even if there were non-governmental organizations involved, the roles would still be played by very similar people: 
outsiders brought in to improve the lot of the local people. <#/>There is a language gap between the people involved in rural farming and the people with the message and ideas necessary to effect development. <#/>That is, the initiator of the proposed dev
elopment is not in a position to communicate effectively with the people charged with the responsibility of doing what needs to be done to effect the necessary changes.

 which deals with issues of language as they relate to society. <#/>Notably, it is more the linguist than the sociologist who subscribes to sociolinguistics though sociology has <-/benefitted> from and contributed to the discipline. <#/>This study deals w
i
th language and development. <#/>One might narrow this down further to the area of language problems in developing nations, although none of the language problems can be exclusively identified with the so-called developing world. <#/>These nations share a
 great deal in their language situations and problems.
\par <#/>Joshua Fishman observed more than two decades ago that the new nations of the world were beset by many language-related problems which were not being given attention by the developing nations themse

nd value hierarchies.
\par <#/>Fishman observes these problems and recommends a scholarly prescription which is ambitious and interdisciplinary in terms of a total problem-orientation. <#/>Sociolinguists have come up with general and specific studies on problems
 of multilingual societies and the development of nationalism; language planning, policy and modernization; language in education and the related psychological and psycholinguistic issues, including issues of language choices and code switching in specifi
c speech communities.
\par <#/>The Sapir-Wolf hypothesis of linguistic determinism and the subsequent less rigid theory of linguistics that closely relates language to culture and the way speakers divide and perceive their world is of particular relevance in con
siderations of effective communication for development in a multilingual set up. <#/>The point of this chapter hinges on the claim that a people's language is a wider perception than their way of doing things in a special and idiosyncratic manner. <#/>Lin
guistic communication can be taken for granted. <#/>It is further held that when communication is intended to change or influence a people's traditions, it needs to be particularly designed for effectiveness, both to be understood and to be acceptable.

e. <#/>Near the borders with Baluhya, for instance, there will naturally be those who speak Luhya either solely or as a second or first language. <#/>For simplicity, this study deals with the Dholuo-speaking people who are the majority in Siaya District.

\par <
#/>It is envisaged that the problems observed for the Dholuo-speakers of Siaya District are not too different from those that are experienced by native speakers of other Kenyan languages in the same situation anywhere else in the republic. <#/>The problem
 
deals with two types of evidence: One relates to the language situation as it affects or defines rural women farmers in Siaya, and the other is a comparison between the language which rural women know and the language the extension workers are likely to u
se in communicating with them. <#/>
\par <#/> It can be observed that the rural woman involved in subsistence farming in Siaya has a native speaker competence of Dholuo only. <#/>This observation can be deduced from many factors. <#/>First, the most obvious alte
rnative languages the woman might speak are English and/or Kiswahili. <#/>English is learned at school, and the majority of women now engaged in subsistence farming in the rural areas did not go to school. <#/>Kiswahili, a <foreign/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 
lingua }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <foreign/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 franca, }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 is}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
learned either at school or from interaction in urban areas. <#/>These women have not been to school and do not frequent towns enough to acquire the language. <#/>A survey by Heine and M\'f6hlig showed that only 20 per cent of Luo people spoke English an
d 57.2 per cent spoke Kiswahili. <#/>With more widespread education which includes English and Kiswahili in the primary education, the percentages have risen in the last ten years. <#/>But that rise is unlikely to have affected rural women farmers. <#/>He
ine and M\'f6
hlig revealed that a number of school-leavers with seven years of English instruction lost their speaking competence because they did not practise it. <#/>By extension, the same can happen with Kiswahili. <#/>Also, it is unlikely that the young wo
men who were in school (to Form 4 or so) in the last ten years are busy farming in rural Siaya; they are away in towns, leaving the older women folk in the villages. <#/>The percentage of Luo Kiswahili speakers was quite large in 1980; however, Heine and 
M\'f6
hlig were quick to point out that Swahili is considerably widespread among the male rather than among the female population. <#/>More younger than older people were found to speak Kiswahili. <#/>All this corroborates the observation that the majority of S
iaya rural women farmers are fluent only in their mother tongue.
\par <#/>The typical development agent in the extension work is a graduate of a system where the language of education is English. <#/>The knowledge, ideas and expertise have been acquired in English. <X_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
<#/>In fact the knowledge of English is part of a status symbol in a factual way. <#/>If the development agent is young, Kiswahili was learned at school or acquired in the <-_cause><+_course> of work experience in urban areas. <#/>This is likely t
o be of the <foreign/>}{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 lingua <foreign/>franca }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
level. <#/>In addition, the extension worker will usually have another mother tongue other than Dholuo because Siaya is simply a place of work. <#/>For the sake of argument, if the agent is young, even if Siaya
 was the home district, it is possible that the person lacks mother-tongue competence in both Dholuo and the agriculturally-related culture. <#/>The predominant situation is one where the woman farmer (the person to be helped) and the extension worker (de
velopment agent) have no common language. <#/>Personal observation reveals worse. <#/>Although the subsistence farming in Siaya is done predominantly by women, they do not go to public places such as }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>}{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
barazas }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 or even modern <ea/>}{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 Harambee }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 gatherings. <#/
>They live in a world completely different from the world of the extension workers. <#/>They do not even identify these workers when they meet them in markets. <#/>So, the two carry on in the same geographical locality with nothing common between them. <#
/>Extension workers were more visible and famous 30 years ago than they are now. <#/>In fact, ironically, those workers who have retired are still known widely as <ea/>}{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 ja agriculture, }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
the Dholuo term for the agricultural extension worker.
\par <#/>A typical scen
ario in Siaya is a homestead with a widow whose children are away in towns. <#/>Children who are present are usually those who cannot get jobs in towns; they are not there because they have opted to be farmers. <#/>When the children return home for visits
,
 they can attempt to modernize the farming and make use of what they know exists as service in the extension workers. <#/>Because of their brief visits, all they can do is to introduce the extension worker to the problem (which might be a sick cow or infe
cted fruit trees). <#/>Therefore, the only hope is that the old mother will be there when the extension worker does a follow-up.
\par <#/>There are many factors which make the follow-up impossible. <#/>First there is the cultural difference between the old mothe
r's world and that of the extension worker. <#/>The mother is old, traditional, conservative, practical, indigenous; the extension worker is modern, innovative, academic, foreign and new. <#/>The rules and regulations for the relationship of the two perso
n
s differ according to the cultures of their two worlds. <#/>There is no natural way in which these two persons can get together to influence each other. <#/>It is in the midst of all this that it is important to realize that the two people do not have a c
o
mmon language in which they can effectively communicate. <#/>Among other things, the language barrier makes it impossible for the follow-up to continue, and everybody gets discouraged. <#/>The orange trees are dug up and used as firewood; the cow dies wit
h all the sons' investment of thousands of shillings.
\par <h> <#/>The languages involved </h>
\par <#/>Language is intricately related to a people's culture -their way of life, values and activities. <#/>The relationship between language and culture is such that a l
ook at an aspect of a language will reveal the speakers' ways of doing things, thinking and values in that specific aspect of life. <#/>In unmarked communication situations, not everything is said to make the communication effective. <#/>When people use t
h
e same language and have the same cultural background, both speaker and listener rely on common shared background knowledge and presuppositions for the total understanding of what is uttered or heard. <#/>The acquisition of language for effective communic
a
tion involves much more than the sounds and grammar that is ordinarily taught in schools. <#/>Knowing a language for effective communication requires a knowledge of gestures, paralinguistic sounds, proverbs, riddles and even legends and oral tales of the 
people.
\par <#/>This study looks at a very small area of the Dholuo language, the vocabulary of farming. <#/>As far as it has been observed, this vocabulary reflects the practices and thoughts traditional to farming among the Luo in Siaya District. <#/>It is a 
window into the culture and thought of the people in relation to this particular aspect of their life. <#/>Dholuo is compared to English as the extension worker knows it. <#/>The English equivalent is thus given as translation where it is known}{

\par <#/>This disquisition is a metaphysical reflection on two intractabl
e and elusive issues in Philosophy and, shall I say, physical science - the issue of the origin of the universe and the issue of its eventual disintegration. <#/>The universe or cosmos intrinsically comprising everything that there is in actuality; everyt
h
ing that there can be in potency - in a word everything that our mind can perceive or intuit in all temporal and spatial context - is an expansive mass of objects or bodies contiguously arranged in a closed system of corporeal substances characterised by 
t
he extension of parts outside parts and which, in their physical totality, posit as a reality to human cognition. <#/>This reality that is the object of human cognition presupposes the existence of a mind or intellect equipped with what the Philosopher Im
manuel Kant called <foreign/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 a }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <foreign/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 priori }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
forms or conditions of judgement or understanding to <-/cognize> it and indeed the mind must perceive it because it is real, it is a being and a compelling datum. <#/>In posing the question of the origin and d
isintegration of the universe, we are also indirectly addressing the problem of whence and wither of the substantial reality that envelops and saturates it.
\par <#/>Before we delve into the exegesis, a word or so must be said about the relevance of Metaphysics in this complex discourse. <#/>Metaphysics is a coinage of two Greek words <foreign/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 meta }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 and <foreign/>}{
\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 phusika }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 or when qualified <foreign/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 ta }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <foreign/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 meta }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <foreign/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 ta }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <foreign/>}{
\i\f0\fs24\lang2057  phusika }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 which literally means the things after or beyond the physics whic
h, in Aristotle's conception, sequentially became the subject of philosophical inquiry. <#/>Methodologically, Aristotle shifted the philosophical focus from the physical phenomena to theoretical abstract phenomena with a view to discerning their ultimate 
natures and abstracting their most general properties or characteristics at their transcendental order.
\par }\pard\plain \s40\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \f16\fs36\lang2057 {\f0\fs24 <#/>Thereupon, Metaphysics at once became a science of things (of being) in their abstract order or in their substantial reality rather than in their acc
idental reality. <#/>Metaphysics at once assumed a peculiar role in the philosophical speculations whereby it distinguished itself as the final authority in proffering philosophical solutions always on the assumption that reason cannot go wrong if it is w
e
ll-directed and well-tempered towards its object of cognition. <#/>As the most potent tool of human reason, metaphysical reflections had no boundaries. <#/>They encompassed the terrestrial as well as ex-terrestrial reality and even the reality of immateri
a
l beings. <#/>This pretentious claim of cognitive ascendancy by Metaphysics caused a revulsion in the Philosopher Kant when he called for the dethronement of Metaphysics as the queen of the sciences because it was in the habit of pretending to go beyond w
h
at actually it is capable of in its epistemological concerns. <#/>Kant's criticism of Metaphysics (and by the way it was traditional Metaphysics of the Fathers and Medievalists generally ) has been unfairly interpreted by anti-metaphysicians and philosoph
e
rs of positivistic schools to portray Metaphysics as an irrelevant and semantic discipline whose death should have come earlier than the Kantian intervention to debunk it. <#/>However, on a <-/sobre> and objective interpretation of Kant's critique, it is 
f
airly evident that what he actually introduced in his exposition is a new brand of Metaphysics born out of a legitimate <-/skepticism> <foreign/>vis-'a-vis traditional dogmatic Metaphysics. <#/>Thus, in order to salvage Metaphysics, Kant had to turn into 
a
 <AmE/>skeptic in order to construct a sustainable groundwork upon which all future Metaphysics would rest. <#/>This he did admirably well by designating the province and object of all future metaphysical cognitive claims. <#/>Specifically, he discovered 
a
nd propounded that Metaphysics is inapplicable to the <-/noumenal> nature of things and only valid when its analyses relate to things as they appear to us or as they manifest themselves to us as phenomenal essences. <#/>If metaphysical cognitive claims ar
e
 about knowledge of things-in-themselves (<foreign/>Das <foreign/>Ding <foreign/>an <foreign/>Sich) then Metaphysics is not only doomed but also futile as a science. <#/>And this happens to be the closest Kant came to implying a denial of the possibility 
of the science of Metaphysics.
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \f16\fs20\lang1031 {\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
Metaphysics as a science attempts to offer the most exhaustive and ultimate explanations to reality not so much as individualized but as a coherent whole. <#/>And where it is a science of being, the implication is that its
 major concern is about being in its most general characteristics or properties as can be abstracted by the mind. <#/>It tends to ignore the materiality of beings and instead to concentrate on the being's immaterial aspect. <#/>It is for this latter reaso
n
 that many people have been prompted to regard Metaphysics as an occult science of the divinity, of the immortality of the soul, of the angels and other supernatural beings that there can be. <#/>This wrong impression may be enhanced and justified if the 
metaphysical enterprise were solely that of the medievalists and the schoolmen of the scholastic academies. <#/>And yet this is precisely what Kant and others reacted against to make Metaphysics more open-ended and open-minded.
\par <#/>Metaphysics is the scienc
e of the essences of things and in so far it constitutes itself into an ultimate Philosophy or first Philosophy as Aristotle chose to call it. <#/>And in so far as it is an ultimate philosophy, it undertakes a thorough investigation into those ultimate pr
i
nciples and causes of things in order to reach out for some form of objective truth or objective account of the phenomena of nature. <#/>Furthermore, Metaphysics being the science of the essences of things, must employ reason at the highest level in the t
a
sk of educing substances (ultimate natures) of things from objects of cognition. <#/>Reason employed at the highest level must consciously engage in the contemplation of the object of cognition in order to abstract from it the universal property of that o
bject which it then stores within itself as a representative concept of future reference.
\par <#/>Metaphysics being a science of being <foreign/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 qua}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  being or the science of the natures of things or the science of the ultimate principles of things, cannot be ind
ifferent to the study of reality considered as one, as whole and as constituting a coherent system. <#/>The coherent system that the universe is, the super-substance that it evinces, the causality of forces that are at play in the cosmic reality, the sear
c
h for the primordial elements or stuff of the cosmos, the harmony or apparent disharmony in the universe call not only for a scientific explanation but also for a metaphysical intervention to shed light where empirical science cannot proffer any apodeicti
c explanation.
\par <#/>Where science, for example, cannot formulate a reliable scientific answer to problems such as the immortality of the soul or the nature of the divinity, Metaphysics cannot be altogether irrelevant in formulating rational explanations base
d on the working of causal forces and relying on the apodeictic principles governing the workings of the human mind, notably the principle of contradiction, the principle of excluded middle, and the principle of sufficient reason. <#/>These principles upo
n
 which alone human reasoning is founded being philosophical in nature, must be rigorously applied in the quest for knowledge and nature of all-there-is in the universe. <#/>Where empirical science can provide us with reasons for how things are the way the
y
 are, Metaphysics (Philosophy by implication) should provide us with explanations on why things happen the way they do. <#/>This role that Philosophy plays greatly complements the scientific endeavour and more so because the philosophical data encountered
 in causal relationships of physical objects may go to waste or get ignored in a scientific laboratory. <#/>The role, therefore, played by Metaphysics in human cognitive endeavour is complementary to that played by the scientist.
\par <#/>There are, moreover, tr
anscendental notions which are only applicable to trans-physical or <-/metempirical> substances and which postulate philosophical reasoning to appraise them and to commit them to the universe of human discourse. <#/>The mere detection of the transcendenta
lity of these notions is not an exercise of empirical nature but of a mind engrossed in and captivated by the novelty of ideas always accepted and embraced for their own sake.
\par <#/>Science can tell us that organic an inorganic substances came about through t
he process of evolution but it may not be in a position to tell us what primary matter preceded that evolutionary process or what reality could be presupposed in order for the evolutionary process to take place. <#/>Now, by the adoption of the principle o
f
 causality, Metaphysics has succeeded to formulate explanations such as the ones we shall encounter in this exposition at a later stage. <#/>By and large then, we can say that Metaphysics is not totally irrelevant to the scientific inquiries of nature but
 very much a complement and a vital ancillary.
\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 The Nature of Bodies in the Universe}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  </h>
\par <#/>Talking about the nature of bodies in the Universe, we proceed from the assumption that these bodies are a reality very much manifest to us by medium of our
 senses and by scientific observations. <#/>There is no gainsaying that our consciousness in the state of sanity is capable of testifying to the fact that our senses, especially sight and touch, do indeed perceive external extended bodies in two and three
 
dimensions. <#/>These bodies possess a continuous extension and enjoy what in Philosophy is known as external extension and internal extension by virtue of the formal effect of being quantified. <#/>Bodies external to our senses are a reality unless we wa
nt to profess the crude philosophy of solipsism, the negative philosophy of subjectivism and the idle philosophy of <AmE/>skepticism.
\par <#/>The bodies in the physical universe enjoy a continuous extension and, by virtue of this, they are individually known as }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 continuum }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 in the scholastic jargon. <#/>A }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 continuum }{
\f0\fs24\lang2057 having continuous quantity as opposed to a }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 quantum }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
with its discrete quantity, is a substantial unity with a potential infinity of parts that can be rendered actual only after division. <#/>The severed p
art in turn constitutes yet another substantial unity with the attendant potential infinity of parts and which in themselves exist in that unity in the state of potency.
\par <#/>This state of affairs, renders the substantial unity (the }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 continuum) }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 a peculiar substance composed of two states: act and potency. <#/>The }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 continuum }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
as a substantial unity exists in act unto itself and also exists in potency in as far as its potential parts can be divided }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 in infinitum. <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 The continuum then is a composition of what the
 Scholastics might have referred to as a substance of <foreign/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 divisibilia }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <foreign/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 in }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <foreign/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 divisibilia.
\par <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Since a }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 continuum is }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 a quantity, one of its principal determinations or properties must appropriately be divisibility, others being impenetr
ability, measurability, external extension, and internal extension.
\par <#/>Indeed an infinite divisibility of a }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 continuum }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 must be self-evident since we cannot purport to uphold the possibility of division and at the same time insist that the object of divisio
n is unextended and indivisible. <#/>This would be a case of contradiction in terms. <#/>Moreover, if the object of division is pared down to a mere point, logical, mathematical or otherwise which has absolutely no extension the very concept of }{
\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 continuum }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 w
ould vanish because no amount of unextended points can be components of a continuous extension and neither would they produce an extension. <#/>Following on this, it can be comfortably argued that all continuous quantity must ultimately consist of extende
d parts whose divisibility can take place without limit and more so because it can never reach unextended point which can negate the very essence of a }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 continuum }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 or extended }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 quantum. <#/>

\par <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Talking of infinite divisibility of parts of a }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 continuum }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 in itself
 already raises enigmatic puzzles for both philosophical physics as well as empiriological physics. <#/>The puzzle relates directly to the issue of the origin and final end of the universe of physical objects that are the topic of this thesis. <#/>Moreove
r
, if we accept the principle of empiriological physics that matter is never created and can never be destroyed, the complexity of the problem is even all the more compounded if this is related to the cosmogony and annihilation of the material universe. <#

erial universe that we know through sensation or through direct intuition had a beginning. <#/>If the answer is in the affirmative, then I shall attempt to demonstrate the nature of it as well as the time and space frames of its coming about.
\par <#/>If, on th
e other hand, the answer is in the negative then we may be equally plunged into an unpleasant dilemma of having to affirm either the eternity (aeviternity) or coevality of the universe <foreign/>vis-'a-vis that being which enjoys a permanent <foreign/>}{

 as Boethius chose to call it.
\par <#/>The nature of the physical objects in the universe has already been alluded to especially as regards the characteristics of the contin
uous quantity. <#/>Proceeding from the assumption that all material objects in the cosmos are intrinsically made of the same stuff (matter that is) we can infer that their physical determinations will be common to all even though variously in terms of int

lity <use/>anteceding it. <#/>The question then that arises is: can we <use/>antecede an antecedent and <use/>antecede the antecedent prior to it indefinitely? <#/>This is really a formidable challenge to Metaphysics.
\par <#/>What does Metaphysics say about the problem of infinite regress with regard to the divisibility of the extended quantity? <#/>Is the divisibility in infinite regress sustainable to counterpoise the successive divisibility of the extended }{
\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 quantum? <#/>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 It is certainly sustainable to the exten

\par <#/>However, the really crucial question here is not so much that Metaphysics can envision the possibility of an infinite regress as whether that kind of exercise can have any epistemological value, being itself
 a repeated identical operation of the mind whereby it appears to add and then to subtract endlessly. <#/>The process is almost tantamount to conjuring a geometrical or mathematical point and adding another similar point to it or subtracting another ident
ical point from it.
\par <#/>Obviously, no matter how often this exercise is repeated, it will not change the status of the geometrical point - it will forever remain sterile and impoverished as it ever was <foreign/>}{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 in }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <foreign/>}{
\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 principio. <#/>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 And so where the

and always reinforced by the principles of economy on Occam's razor it would make better sense to eliminate altogether any concept which inherently calls for a counter-productive exercise involving an infinite regress.
\par <#/>If a }{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 continuum is }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 truly an extended body as we have established it is, then inescapably it occupies space by virtue of which it derives its reality and designation as an <foreign/>}{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
extensum. <#/>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 And if it occupies space, its ontological reality as an existential being must b

\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \f16\fs20\lang1031 {\f0\lang2057 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 For a competent and first speaker of Dholuo (Luo language), Okoth Okombo's }{\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 Masira ki Ndaki}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  has many p
ossible translations. <#/>"One Doesn't Click One's Tongue at Misfortune" is perhaps the most literal though inadequate because it does not cater for the figurative meanings of the title. <#/>A chain of other probable translations are not difficult to come
 
by through oral inquiry: "Wonders Never <-_>Ceases><+_Cease>;" "Annoyance or Disgust Can't Deter Misfortune;" "Misfortune Strikes at the Wrong Time;" "Misfortune is Inevitable;" "Humanity is Helpless before Disaster;" "Nobody Is Known to Solicit Suffering
;
" "Misfortune Is Stupidly Stubborn" "Misfortune Is Notorious for Stampeding". <#/>The results of this oral exchange contradict my conventional understanding that a translation should be precise and neatly restricted to a few meaningful words. <#/>Almost e
very other reading of the title yields a different answer. <#/>There is an array of possible questions and answers with every attempt to make sense of this title; the reader is engaged in an endless oral exercise.
\par <#/>So many translations for a three-word t
itle cannot but be explications, descriptions or creative processes in a search for meanings. <#/>I am almost naturally reminded of a riddling game in which, conventionally, each riddle has only one fixed answer and meaning. <#/>The book-title elicits a v
ariety of responses and answers and should really be called an unconventional riddle; it encourages endless conversation with the reader.
\par <#/>In other words, the expression }{\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 Masira ki Ndaki}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 , by virtue of its puzzling nature, creates texts in the form of read
er-responses. <#/>As Walter Ong would have it, Okombo's book talks to its "fictionalized" readers.
\par <#/>If we are agreed that }{\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 Masira ki Ndaki}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  is an extraordinary riddle, then we could as well state that it is the kind of item that Dholuo calls <ea/>}{\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 ngero}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  or <ea/>}{
\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 sigana}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>In English, the book may pass as a novel or novella. <#/>Not that the novel and  <ea/>ngero (<ea/>sigana) genres mean the same thing; it is safe to state that they are close. <#/>This is not the place to compare Luo and English literary t
raditions. <#/>Each tradition must be studied in its own right before comparisons may be highlighted. <#/>Nor am I intent on delving into Luo literary tradition per se. <#/>My primary objective in this essay is to attempt a reading of }{
\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 Masira ki Ndaki}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  in th
e context of Luo oral literature in particular and oral tradition in general. <#/>And thus far, my opening argument is that the written text of the story is a representation of other texts, some visible and others not. <#/>The obvious inference from this 
i
s that the written text represents itself, the visible, just as the sign - any sign - represents itself the same way it may signify something else. <#/>Once the represented is connected with its sign however, it becomes part of that sign. <#/>It, in fact,
 becomes that sign. <#/>For this death of the gap of referentiality between the signifier and signified, Roland Barthes' }{\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 Mythologies}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 is our major weapon. <#/>If we return to the translations yielded by the oral interviews earlier, then the story's inscribed meaning is merely a meaning of many other meanings.
\par <#/>To echo Barthes in application, the differences between the meanings are annulled by the one or any other text that represents them. <#/>Where or when one begins to amplify and describe these differe
nces, one is indulging in rhetoric, a sure way to <-/destablise> and, in fact, destroy the harmony in the world of meaning. <#/>I am positing that meanings create and re-create one another and that this attribute is inherent in art. <#/>Rhetoric is then a
 mechanism for displaying the social movement of art-forms for human communication. <#/>In words closely related to Stephen Tyler's }{\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 The Said and the Unsaid}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
, the said speaks very loudly about the unsaid as if each word or statement has an invisible shadow. <
#/>Logically then, even the visible - the words on paper - are shadows of the invisible (this representative attribute of language is obviously traceable to Saussure, Barthes, Ong and many others). <#/>For our purposes, the crux of the matter is that }{
\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 Masira ki Ndaki}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 is a visible shadow-sign-of the invisible. <#/>The story "talks" about the invisible (and either renders it visible in that very written form or sets it en route to visibility through the act of writing). <#/>With the knowledge that sound is inv
isible, we need not over-stress the fact that writing is an attempt to shape, colour and announce it (sound). <#/>Writing can surely never be more oral.

\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \f16\fs20\lang1031 {\f0\lang2057 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 It is a truism that a story is always assumed to be a writer's o
wn creation. <#/>He is in it; his voice runs through it - is it - because he is the teller. <#/>I have already remarked that }{\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 Masira ki Ndaki}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 is a kind of riddle. <#/>It should also be added that it is a proverb, a puzzling saying.
\par <#/>Which is the more the
 reason why the book-title alone inspires so many interpretations and, understandably, the numerous meanings and translations. <#/>Not surprisingly, the narrator declares from the very beginning that the story will undertake to treat the reader to <foreig
n_><X_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 "Gik ma ji pok oneno kata motimonegi rumbi ok gi nyal neno bergi kata rachgi"}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  </X><foreign/>.
\par <#/>= "Events nobody has experienced or witnessed; events so foggy and unclear nobody knows how good or bad they are".
\par <#/>Okombo is re-visiting the age-old
 claim that the African story-teller is a teacher, a social educator on moral values and standards. <#/>He is "talking" by locking vice and virtue in combat in order to help us see and follow a moral path. <#/>He is telling us how and where to leap after 
l
ooking right, left, backwards and forwards. <#/>The teaching precludes preaching and proselytizing because the story-teller does not pretend to be a know-all. <#/>He seeks and finds refuge in the rhetoric of the story-line and the characters therein. <#/>
About to be delivered is a story that is too heavy for the tongue to carry and communicate (<foreign_><X_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 "pek ne lep wacho}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <foreign/>, }{\v\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 MN}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  P.3}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
)</X>. <#/>The tongue represents the teller and his community (audience). <#/>Despite his being the sole story-telle
r, the expression is meant to imply that his tongue carries a communal tongue (He does not say "my tongue"). <#/>The community is, in a way, talking to itself. <#/>From the front cover to this expression, the story lets the community speak to itself by me
rging its voice with the narrator's. <#/>Going by the same argument, the community actually teaches itself. <#/>The expression, <foreign_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 "pek ne lep wacho"}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
<foreign/> is indeed, an open invitation to the audience to immerse themselves in the discourse.
\par <#/>A retreat to the proverbial utterance, }{\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 Masira ki Ndaki}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
, helps us confirm that the narrator is steeped in oral culture through a persistent provocation of audential interpretation, judgement and participation. <#/>As Ong observes:
\par <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <quote_><X_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 Oral utterance thus encourages a sense of continuity with life, a sense of participation, because it is itself }{\v\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 participation}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>Writing and print, despite the intrinsic value, have obscured the nature of the word and of thought itself, for they have sequestered th
e essentially participatory word-fruitfully enough, beyond a doubt - from its natural habitat, sound, and assimilated it to a mark on a surface, where a real word cannot exist at all [1977:21}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 ]}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 .}{\f0\fs24\lang2057

\par }\pard\plain \s94\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \f16\lang1031 {\f0\lang2057 <#/>The stress on "participatory" is mine if only 
to reinforce the stance that Okoth's narrative mission is pegged on the involvement of his audience. <#/>Where Ong argues that the written story obliterates the real world of orality, the response is that Okombo's story and its style of delivery (includin
g the artistic voice of the omniscient teller) recreate that world.
\par <h> <#/>3. RUMOUR-MONGERING AS STORY-TELLING: </h>
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \f16\fs20\lang1031 {\f0\lang2057 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Having subtly abdicated the responsibility of single-voiced story-telling, the narrator ingeniously harnesses the technique of rumour-mongering.

\par <#/>In the world of rumour, it is <-/upto> each individual to choose what type of information to take or leave. <#/>(I need not explain the intrinsic orality of rumour). <#/>In the final analysis, language <-/neans> what one wants it to mean for
 a specific purpose; only for a purpose do we take a rumour to mean one thing or another.
\par <#/>An utterance (most utterances) normally gets a meaning constructed for it by the respondent. <#/>Whatever is done, the attitude adopted and the directions taken a
re all acts accruing from the generative power of any particular one or number of rumours. <#/>By the time one acts in response to a rumour, the understanding is that the very rumour has exerted its powers and <-/yeilded> results or answers. <#/>That rumo
urs are echoed and multiply through a community testify to their power of motion and ability to survive.
\par <#/>Perhaps the character who generates most rumour in }{\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 MN}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  is Abayo alias Kathorina Adongo. <#/>Rumoured to be wallowing in secret love-affairs with a Se
venth-day Adventist Pastor, Abayo commits the crime of crimes by eloping with her husband's former herdsboy and fisherman but now turned into a rich coffee-smuggler in Uganda. <#/>Nobody knows anything for sure except for the fact that she finally dies af
t
er Jen Denja stabs her because of a rivalry over Akuko the coffee-smuggler. <#/>Ultimately, Abayo's profligacy is not mere rumour; she dies tragically at the hands of a professional prostitute. <#/>Rumour persists in social circulation in the sheer search
 
for the truth. <#/>Abayo's eventual death now confirms rumour as the truth: she is adulterous, irresponsible and cheap. <#/>She has been acting-doing her part of the story we are being told - in bars and Akuko's bedroom. <#/>And her society acts by propag
ating her story. <#/>The re-telling of her narrative becomes a social act.
\par <#/>Abayo, the protagonist in the social act is represented by the <-/words-stories-invented> and woven around her life and character.
\par }\pard\plain \s94\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \f16\lang1031 {\f0\lang2057 <#/>Because of her disappearance into a romanti
c and sexual link with Akuko, away from her husband's community, words in the shape of rumour fill her absence. <#/>Her identity is limited to the rumours about her social being. <#/>Her social circulation becomes a verbal exercise from mouth to mouth, ea
r

y
 performed and incorporated into social speech acts. <#/>She earns her new name, Abayo, in recognition of her ability to act the irresponsible and immoral rambler. <#/>In keeping with oral tradition, nobody dare address Abayo by the same name in her heari

For non-believers in rumour, suspense is created and Abayo's story goes on until the truth reveals itself. <#/>In the author's own words, <foreign_><X_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 "Ne en sigana mabor mokalo. <#/>Kendo onge ng'ato achiel ma nong'eye duto",}{

 story really exists. <#/>Every member of the community has his/her fragment of an unattainable whole piece. <#/>The creative potential of the oral literary piece is as limitless as Okombo confesses in his narrative.
\par <#/>Like Abayo's, Jen Denja\rquote s tale does not seem to have a beginning or an end. <#/>Her last name is a Luonisation of the En
glish word "Danger". <#/>Nobody is sure of her origins. <#/>Rumour has it that she may be the daughter of a prostitute who probably lived and died in Asego (}{\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 MN}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
), P.39). <#/>For some people, she may be Congolese. <#/>Forever young-looking, it is also rumour
ed that she periodically sloughs off her skin to renew her sweet and magical appearance. <#/>The surest thing about her is that she is able to defend her lovers like a tigress; it is on a mission to recover one of them that she murders Abayo. <#/>Many mor
e
 rumours exist about her. <#/>She is the Daughter of Satan and knows the police so well that she will escape with the murder. <#/>Whatever the plausible rumour about her, Jen's last name, Denja, tells her character and story. <#/>In fact, like Abayo, her 
n
ame is her character, life-story and all. <#/>Even without reading Okombo's story, a speaker of Dholuo would guess very accurately what sort of people the two ladies are. <#/>The audience is quite capable of telling itself the ladies' stories on the basis
 of the possible meanings of their names.

\par <#/>The relationship between language and literature has analogously been referred to as the relationship between stone and the sculptor, clay and the potter, etc.
 <#/>This analogy underscores the primacy of language to the artist. <#/>The communication between the artist and the audience must be through a shared linguistic medium.
\par <#/>Evidently, literature as an art is not dependent on language alone. <#/>The prime
 aim of the artist is to make known a worldview, implicitly supposed to be the worldview of the society according to the artist. <#/>This view is rooted in the very existence of the society. <#/>The society's life in time and space is the concern of the a
r
tist. <#/>He/she has a set goal of ultimately educating society on issues that face it in life. <#/>Whether the artist decides to point out weaknesses, or give guidelines, or paints the picture as it appears on the ground, the end goal lies in the attempt
 to give direction to the society. <#/>Art has obviously been used to achieve other undesirable ends. <#/>This underscores the significance of art in influencing worldviews.
\par <#/>In the artist' s endeavour to communicate with the audience, the issue of langu
age comes in. <#/>Language must be seen as it affects the artist as well as the audience. <#/>The two must share a linguistic medium among others. <#/>In this sharing, the level of language competence in the Chomskyan sense becomes significant. <#/>The ar
tist must be competent enough in the language of communication, in what we may call literary language competence. <#/>This is what will make a work of art understandable and thus useful in society.
\par <#/>Literary language competence in the sense we are using 
it here prompted the early Greeks to use it as the best exemplification of language use and in extreme cases, artists were thought to have been the originators of language. <#/>We are not interested, in this paper, in the merits of literary language as so
urce material for linguistic analysis. <#/>Nevertheless, the artist must have a good command of the language of communication which should be as near as possible to native speaker competence.
\par <#/>The central position that language occupies in literature thr
ows light into the importance of language choice in situations where a society has more than one language, or where there is one language but many dialects. <#/>The multiplicity of languages spoken in Africa makes language choice a sensitive matter.

\par <#/>La
nguage choice means an understanding of the language situation in our societies. <#/>The young artist needs to know the options that there are in order to be able to make the best choice that will enable him/her to communicate effectively to the right aud
ience. <#/>It is imperative that the young playwright understands the sociolinguistic situation in our society.
\par <#/>Unlike the novel, the play has a more direct impact on language choice. <#/>A novel is intended to be read. <#/>The audience in this case is 
expected to be literate. <#/>The consumption of the message is at the level of the individual readers who can be aided by dictionaries, encyclopedias etc. <#/>The reader has time to reflect on the language used. <#/>The play, though written, in most insta
nces is to be watched and listened to spontaneously as the actions unfold. <#/>The audience need not <-_to> be literate. <#/>This situation makes the choice of the language of communication by the playwright more sensitive.
\par <#/>Kenya is reflective of the language situation in most African nations. <#/>It is multilingual. <#/>The functional differentiation of the various languages affects the artist as well as the audience. <#/>How then is the language situation in Kenya?

\par <#/>Multilingualism in Kenyans stems 
more from the foreign languages spoken here than from the multiplicity of the local languages. <#/>In terms of local languages, most Kenyans are bilingual speakers, speaking a local language proximity gives rise to bilingualism or even multilingualism. <#
/>This is the case in border areas where daily interaction is responsible for this language situation.
\par <#/>Languages spoken in Kenya can broadly be put into two groups which are: languages of African origin, and languages of non-African origin. <#/>Language
s of African origin are here referred to as local languages while those of non-African origin are referred to as foreign languages.
\par <#/>Languages of African origin fall under four groups. <#/>There are the bantu, the nilotic, the para-nilotic and the cushitic groups}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  (Whiteley 1974)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>The bantu group is further divided into seven sub-groups of Kikuyu, Gusii, Shambaa, Taita, Luyia, Swahili and Mijikenda. <#/>These subgroups <-_represents><+_represent> various related languages and dialects. <#/>Regionally,
 these languages are spoken as local languages at the Coast, Central, Eastern, Western and Nyanza provinces, making the bantu group the most widespread language in Kenya.
\par <#/>The para-nilotic group is divided into three sub-groups. <#/>These are the Teso, 
the Maasai and Kalenjin. <#/>Among these sub-groups are different languages and dialects. <#/>They are spoken mainly in the Rift Valley province. <#/>A few are to be found in Western and Eastern provinces too.
\par <#/>The cushitic group of languages is mostly spoken in the North Eastern province and forms two major groups i.e. <#/>the Somali and Galla.
\par <#/>The nilotic group is by far the most homogeneous. <#/>It has only one language, which is Luo. <#/>Regionally, it is spoken in Nyanza province and around Lake Victoria.
\par <#/>The most important language of African origin in Kenya at the national level is Kiswahili. <#/>It is the perceived national language and is the only one which is learnt as a second language by the majority of Kenyans.
\par <#/>The factors responsible for the emergence of Kiswahili as the national language of Kenya are beyond the scope of this paper. <#/>(See Mbaabu 1985, 1978, 1991: Mutahi 1980: Chiraghdin and Mnyampala 1977: Whiteley 1969)}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 .}{
\f0\fs24\lang2057  <#/>The position that Kiswahili will take in the future as the language of communication of the young playwright will become evident in a later section of this paper.
\par }\pard\plain \s94\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \f16\lang1031 {\f0\lang2057 <#/>The languages of non-African origin are testimony of the influence of the international community to our African nations. <#/>The most import
ant language here is the colonial linguistic legacy which is English. <#/>The official status that English assumed in the colonial period was not affected much by the coming of independence and its influence in the world of written literature is enormous.

Languages of Indian origin are important to note. <#/>According to Neale (1974) Kenyans of Indian origin have their roots in North India. <#/>Their languages originate from Sanskrit and the majority either speak Gujerati, Punjabi or Konkani. <#/>These 
languages started being spoken in Kenya during the building of the Kenya - Uganda railway. <#/>They are spoken exclusively by Indians.
\par <#/>The struggle of France and Germany to make a cultural mark on the Kenyan scene is bearing fruit and the German and Fr
ench languages are increasingly being used in Kenya. <#/>The department of foreign languages, training French and German teachers at Kenyatta University is a case in point.
\par <#/>There are other European languages spoken on a lesser scale and they do not have a notable influence on the Kenyan language scene.
\par <#/>The above situation affects the young playwright in a direct way. <#/>In the majority of cases, a child's first contact with language is in the local languages which in essence are the child's first language.
\par <#/>By the time a child starts formal education, the local language will have been acquired. <#/>Through these languages the child makes the first contact with literature in its oral form. <#/>Literary creativity is nurtured via narratives, riddle
s, songs etc. <#/>which form the child's literary diet at home.
\par <#/>The above may not be entirely true of the urban areas. <#/>The heterogeneous nature of the urban population calls for a language of wider communication which in this case is Kiswahili. <#/
>It is widely spoken beyond its coastal homeground. <#/>The majority of children in urban areas acquire it as a first language, simultaneously with the first language of the parents. <#/>The Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, in its radio and television tran
s
missions continuously acts as source environment for the learners. <#/>Most government schools in the urban areas use Kiswahili as the medium of <-_instructions><+_instruction> in the first classes of primary school. <#/>In the rural areas, respective loc
al languages are used.
\par <#/>English is learnt in the school system for the majority of children in Kenya. <#/>It is first taught as a subject while the local language serves as the language of instruction. <#/>In upper primary, English takes over as the lang
uage of instruction for the rest of school and college life. <#/>Social stratification has its resultant effects on language used the world over. <#/>In Kenya, children from more affluent families will acquire English as the first and sometimes only langu
age they are competent in for most of their life. <#/>This is a case of cultural alienation invariably leading to linguistic alienation.
\par <#/>English introduces literature as an academic subject although the youth will have participated in it in other langua
ges. <#/>This may create in the youth an illusion of formality in a way that makes them feel that it is the fairest medium to use in literature.
\par <#/>Language use in the Kenyan youth cannot be complete without mentioning <ea/>Sheng. <#/><ea/>Sheng is a yout
h affair which unfortunately is used in place of Swahili. <#/>It is mainly used in major areas. <#/>Today, <ea/>Sheng is in a fluid situation and only time will tell whether it will evolve into a pidgin of either English or Swahili. <#/>The important thin
g to note here is that it is used by the youth for communication between themselves.
\par <#/>From the foregoing, the Kenyan young playwright is a polyglot. <#/>He/she has been and may still be receiving formal education in school. <#/>In terms of language, this
 means that there is a command of at least three languages - a local language, Kiswahili and English. <#/>Each of these brings with it a specific audience. <#/>The available audience competent in Kiswahili is more in number than that competent in English 
which in turn is more than the local languages.
\par <#/>Which is the precedent that the young playwright has in terms of language choice in <-/playwriting>? <#/>All the languages are used in varying degrees. <#/>For a long time, plays at the national scene have
 been written in English and Kiswahili. <#/>Ngugi's decision in 1977 ushered in plays written in local languages when he collaborated with Ngugi wa Mirii in the drafting of }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Ngahika Ndenda}{\f0\fs24\lang2057

\par <#/>A later development has been witnessed with regard to plays written and/or acted in local languages. <#/>What can be referred to as hotel theatre in Kenya today targets patrons from particular et

rt of Kikuyu speaking Kenyans in the city and the neighbouring Kiambu district.
\par <#/>Due to sociolinguistic factors, most central Bantus understand and indeed endeavour to speak Kikuyu. <#/>Following this, the Luo language has also been used in the staging o
f plays but with a varying degree of success. <#/>Local languages are used more in song than drama.
\par <#/>Writing plays in the local languages has and will always be faced with a limited audience. <#/>One will always communicate with the minority of Kenyans.
 <#/>The use of these languages should be confined to community based plays especially at the village level reflecting the most immediate environment and experience. <#/>This should especially be in cases where the audience does not understand Kiswahili. 
<#/>No community should be so <AmE/>self-centered in Kenya today as to feel that her problems are so unique as to warrant a linguistic barrier.
\par <#/>English has been in Kenya for a long time. <#/>Christened anglophone, Kenya still has to choose between Engli
sh and Kiswahili depending on the context of usage. <#/>By virtue of the position that English has enjoyed, many plays are written in it. <#/>Being the medium of instruction in schools, it enjoys a favourable position as evidenced by the number of works p
ublished in it. <X_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057

\par }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Evidence of <-/playwriting> in Kiswahili goes back to 1953. <#/>This is when Henry Kuria's play, }{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 Nakupenda Lakini}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  was staged by students of Alliance Hi
gh School. <#/>It was subsequently published in 1957. <#/>Since then, many more have been written and published. <#/>Annually, scores are entered in drama festivals. <#/>The field of <-/playwriting> in Kiswahili is rich. <#/>This is where the future of th
e youth in terms of language choice lies.
\par <#/>The choice of Kiswahili as the national language stemmed from its potential to unify the nation, at least linguistically. <#/>The advantages of such a situation range from cultural to technological. <#/>It is th
e only way to evolve a national culture. <#/>For a long time after independence, Kiswahili was not given the consideration it needed in the school system. <#/>It was optional at the secondary school level and it was not examinable at the primary level. <#
/>Worse still it was not recognized on the job market as opposed to English.
\par <#/>Today, the situation has changed. <#/>With the inception of 8-4-4 in 1983 Kiswahili became not only compulsory but examinable. <#/>This means that all the school going youth in
 Kenya are studying Kiswahili as a subject and are expected to have a relatively high level of competence in it. <#/>The youth of the 90s and beyond should find no problem in communicating in Kiswahili. <#/>This way they will not only communicate with a l
arger audience but also they will have played a major role in creating a favourable attitude in Kenyans towards Kiswahili.
\par <#/>Over the second half of this century, the language of African literature has been discussed in various fora. <#/>The idea of Kiswa
hili being a continental language was and still is important. <#/>The reason is really obvious. <#/>If we are talking of African unity politically and economically, why not linguistically? <#/>Linguistic unity may not necessarily be a solution to total un
ity as evidenced by the situation in Somalia. <#/>But paradoxically without it many problems are likely to emerge.
\par <#/>More than ever before, Kiswahili should be introduced in North, West and South Africa. <#/>In Central Africa, it should be strengthened. <
#/>East Africa should be the torch bearer. <#/>When this situation eventually obtains, then the question of language choice to the African youth and Africans in general will not be an issue.

\par <#/>The proposed study of the history of the Marakwet will be conducted in the northern and T
ot divisions of the Keiyo - Marakwet District of the Rift Valley Province. <#/>At the advent of British colonial rule, the area was occupied by five territorial sub-groups, namely: Endo, Markweta, Borokot, Almo and Cherangany. <#/>These sub-groups, though
 politically autonomous, had a common residence and settlement along the Kerio Valley and the Cherangany hills, (see appendix IV for the maps of the area of study).
\par <#/>The origin of the name Marakwet as it is used today is uncertain. <#/>However, according
 to Kipkorir (1973), the name only emerged in the colonial period. <#/>Kipkorir argues that there are no such people as "Marakwet"; the name is a corruption of Markweta. <#/>This latter refers to a sub-ethnic unit of the larger Kalenjin group. <#/>Along w
i
th the Almo, Cherangany, Borokot and Kiptani, the Markweta were forced into the Marakwet division, of the Keiyo - Marakwet district by the British <-/adminisration>. <#/>To Kipkorir then, the name is a colonial coinage used as an umbrella term to refer to
 these sub-groups for administrative purposes. <#/>In this study, the name will be used in Kipkorir's sense in reference to the above named sub-groups, or the `Chebleng' as the Pokot call them.
\par <#/>The 1948 census gave the total population of the Marakwet division as 29,542 persons. <#/>The population was divided as follows:

tsetse fly and mosquitoes, and this factor has not only influenced patterns of settlement but also economic activities. <#/>The Marakwet environment favours a variety of economic activities ranging from hunting and gathering and bee-keeping in the Cherang

e of African response to the establishment of colonial rule. <#/>Two of the earliest of such scholars were Ronald Robinson and John Gallagher , exponents of the idea of the strategic importance of Africa to India for Britain. <#/>They blame the partition 
o
f Africa on the "Proto-nationalist" movements of the continent which supposedly threatened the global strategic interests of European nations. <#/>They view African resistance as "romantic reactionary" struggles which compelled reluctant European statesme

\par <#/>At the D

ists as good fortune," as "deliverance from fratricidal internecine wars, from the tyranny of neighbouring tribes, from epidemics, and periodic <-/starvations>", in which people who did not resist were described as "peace-loving" and those who did resist

\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (ibid)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>In his works, the British scholar T.O. <#/>Ranger asserts tha
t, though the African people in East and Central <-_African><+_Africa> could not avoid the imposition of colonial rule, they were not simply objects of processes set in motion from outside Africa and sustained by white initiative. <#/>He argues that even 
in this early period, Africans helped make their own history }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Ranger; 1969)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>Terence Ranger's central argument is that African societies resisted Europeans in every area of European penetration with independence and sovereignty as the guiding principles of the resistance }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Ranger, 1970)}{
\f0\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>Still within the general context of African scene, Mazrui (1970) classifies African resistance and protest into four major categories: the protest of conservation, of corrective censure, of restoration and of transformation.
\par <#/>H.A. Mwanzi has more recently published a generalized study for the East African region. <#/>He points out that African initiatives in the face of European conquest and occupation were determined by the structure of the society in question at t
he time of colonial intrusion and the ecological changes taking place in the 1890s in East Africa }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Mwanzi, 1985)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 .
\par }\pard\plain \s94\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \f16\lang1031 {\f0\lang2057 <#/>In a similar study, Marcia Wright points out that natural disasters are a constant theme in the history of East <-_African><+_Africa> from
 1870 to 1905. <#/>She notes that the outbreak of smallpox, cholera, <foreign/>rinderpest, pleuro-pneumonia, drought and famine amongst others resulted in high human mortality. <#/>Herds were decimated, population dispersed; all these caused compensatory 
raids of one community against the other. <#/>According to her, these disasters greatly weakened African societies and determined the response of these societies to the European Colonial invasion (Wright, 1985).

frica, studies have been done on various communities. <#/>For Tanzania, Kimambo (1969) has examined the Pare society at the advent of the German intervention. <#/>He asserts that in this early period, the Pare were aware of their own interests and took th
e initiative to achieve them by co-operating with the new-comers.
\par <#/>Thus, collaboration was chosen by the Pare to meet the colonial challenge. <#/>On the other hand, Gwassa (1969 and 1972) views the Maji Maji uprising as a protest against German brutality
 and oppression, and as an expression of the desire to regain freedom. <#/>He reiterates the crucial role played by religion as the basis of unity for the matrilineal peoples of southern Tanzania in the face of colonial violence.
\par <#/>In their general works
 on the history of Tanzania, Kjekshus (1977) and Iliffe (1979) pay particular attention to the ecological breakdown of the 1890s which they consider to have greatly weakened the African societies. <#/>They point out that the coming of drought and the outb
r
eak of diseases and famine and widespread locust invasion not only broke the backbone of many of the most prosperous Tanganyikan communities; established authority was undermined and political contacts between the peoples altered thus delaying the restruc
turing of Tanganyika's varied pre-colonial economies into a colonial mould.
\par <#/>As regards the people of Uganda, Steinhart has analysed the responses of western Kingdoms to British colonial invasion. <#/>His central argument is that the response was dictate
d by the needs and objectives of the different communities. <#/>So whereas some communities resisted, others collaborated. <#/>This variegated response resulted in the accommodation of alien political values and institutions. <#/>The political process of 
change that took place could be said to have benefited both the colonizer and the colonized (Steinhart, 1977).

the establishment of a nominal form of administration in the East African protectorate - as Kenya was known to 1920 - met with opposition, but lack of unity greatly weakened this cause. <#/>This was true of Kenya as a whole.

r of the coastal traders - particularly of kidnapping people for slaves in the Bukusu country - that provoked the latter into being hostile to all foreigners. <#/>This hostility was later extended to the British intrusion.
\par <#/>In respect to the coastal area
, Gregory (1969) attributes the outbreak of the Mazrui rebellion to what he terms unfortunate interference and conflict of ideas over succession. <#/>To him, the rebellion provided the stimulus for the outbreak of other rebellions all over East Africa }{

peditions against the Gusii - in 1904, 1908, and 1914 - reveal their determination to regain freedom. <#/>Examining the same theme, Wipper (1977) pays attention to the rise of the Mumbo cult - a millennial movement that arose among the Abagusil and Luo. <

s historical issue. <#/>He throws attention to the role of the Nandi natural environment, Nandi societal organization, and the role of the Nandi Orkoiyot in the resistance to the British colonial intrusion (Arap Ng'eny, 1970).
\par <#/>A.T. Matson, too, has publ
ished a study in which he provides a picture of the Nandi reaction to alien invasion. <#/>Unlike arap Ng'eny, however, he over-emphasizes the supposed warlike character of the Nandi and pays less attention to the previous history of the Nandi that had bee
n
 characterized by a largely negative attitude towards all foreigners (Matson, 1972). <#/>In another work, Matson narrates the story of the Nandi struggle against the British until the death of the Orkoiyot in 1906. <#/>He asserts that they put up a stiffe
r
 and more protracted fight to preserve their independence than most of the large and in many cases better armed East African peoples. <#/>Further, he argues that with the exception of the Jubaland Somali, only the Banyoro in the early days of the Imperial
 
British East African Company and the Uganda Protectorate, and the Turkana and Langi during the years 1914 - 1918 fought against the imposition of British rule with anything approaching the spirit and tenacity exhibited by the Nandi between 1895 and 1906 (
Matson, 1974).
\par <#/>It is to be noted that relatively more has been written about the Nandi than about the other Kalenjin groups. <#/>Hence, the Nandi resistance is one of the best known historical episodes in Kenya; in the words of Matson, it was an epic ca
mpaign and the longest guerrilla war in Africa before the events in the Portuguese colonies of the 1960s and 1970s. <#/>However, it should be stressed that other Kalenjin groups resisted the imposition of colonial rule.
\par <#/>According to Ochieng, the Kipsig
is were initially friendly to the early travellers and Imperial British East African Company officials, but when their interest clashed with those of the foreigners, they became aloof and indifferent (Ochieng , 1975). <#/>In their works, B.E. <#/>Kipkorir
 
and H.A. <#/>Mwanzi stress the importance of the Kipsigis Orkoiik as the spokesmen of the people in the early phase of confrontation with the colonial invaders. <#/>They argue that it was the popularity of Orkoiik among the people that prevented the Briti
sh from gaining the upper hand in Kipsigis country. <#/>This objective was only achieved with the elimination of the Orkoiik factor when they were deported in the 1930s (Kipkorir, 1974; Mwanzi, 1977).
\par <#/>In his ethnographic study of the Keiyo and Marakwet,
 R.O. <#/>Hennings points out that the behaviour of the early overseas travellers provoked the Marakwet to hostility. <#/>He tells us that when Count Teleki's expedition became <-/desparately> short of food in 1888, it foraged in Endo millet fields; this 
a
ct led to a skirmish (Hennings, 1951). <#/>Similarly, Joseph Thompson's early attempts to draw water from Marakwet irrigation furrows had been frustrated when the Marakwet diverted the water in its upper course after he hesitated to pay the bribe demanded
 (Young, 1962).
\par <#/>Low (1965 )has pointed out that in 1908, a colonial post was set up in Kerio Valley in an attempt to establish so-called friendly relations with the pastoral Pokot. <#/>This post was used in the succeeding decade to bring the Marakwet an
d the Keiyo under British jurisdiction. <#/>Unfortunately, Low neither discusses the relations between the Marakwet and the British before 1908 nor does he extensively review the process by which the Marakwet were brought under the British colonial admini
stration.
\par <#/>C.B. Rosber'g and J. Nottingham have very briefly surveyed the Marakwet society at the advent of colonial rule. <#/>They assert that it was the clash over cattle and land and the murder of one of the settlers in the Uasin Gishu plateau that pr
ovoked the British to send a military expedition against the Marakwet and the Keiyo in 1911 and do not tell anything on the Marakwet response before and after the date.

thinks the <ea/>orkoiik "ultimately came from Kikuyu country" (Mwanzi 1977:127). <#/>Whatever their origins, Mwanzi (ibid) posits that the <ea/>orkoiik themselves seem to have given a different story about their origins. <#/>The chief one, Arap Koilegei, 
is said to have told the Kipsigis that he came from 'Asis' (God) and that he was his son.
\par <#/>That the <ea/>orkoiik moved to Kipsigis territory is no doubt, and Langat (1969) maintains that in about 1894, Kipchomber arap Koilegei, the brother of the Nandi <
ea/>orkoiyot Koitalel arap Samoei came to Kipsigis, and set himself up as <ea/>orkoiyot. <#/>This movement had been occasioned by an 'anti-<ea/>orkoiyot feeling' reigning then in Nandi. <#/>On the other hand, the prevailing conditions in Kipsigis seemed t
o
 have favoured the arrival of the <ea/>orkoiik. <#/>Peristiany (1939) states that since the Kipsigis great <ea/>orkoiyot, Arap Kabuos, had been put to death for giving bad advice to his people, the Kipsigis were left without <ea/>orkoiyot thus, they welco
m
ed 'a maasai <ea/>oloibon'. <#/>Manners (1967) also says that it appears this was a most propitious time for their acceptance among the Kipsigis for there had been a series of military <-/reverseses> experienced by the latter. <#/>The elders and the leade
r
s of the regiments had realised the necessity of a central power to coordinate successful raids, hence 'a kind of general power vacuum was created' and Manners adds that "Laibons who appeared on the scene at that moment stepped into the breach" (ibid 264)
.

<#/>As already indicated it should be noted that prior to the arrival of the <ea/>orkoiik (Laibons), the Kipsigis had diviners whom they referred to as <ea/>orkoiik (singular - <ea/>orkoiyot). <#/>Thus, Laibon probably coming from a Maasai word '<ea/>Oloi
bon' is a foreign word to the Kipsigis, while '<ea/>orkoiik' was the local word. <#/>Since the acceptance of the Nandi <ea/>orkoiik by the Kipsigis, they are locally called 'laibons', '<ea/>Talai' and '<ea/>orkoiik'. <#/>All the Kipsigis Laibons belonged 
to the Kapterugut and Kagipsegon sub-division of the Talai clan.
\par <#/>With their arrival, the Chief <ea/>orkoiyot grafted onto the existing Kipsigis social, economic and political institutions with some modifications to build his status. <#/>He quickly gaine
d influence as a ritual expert and began to give permission and blessings for raids and ceremonies. <#/>They also functioned as advisers and prophets. <#/>The <ea/>orkoiik new roles made the local people to fear them and were referred to as 'the owners of
 the country' and <ea/>orkoiyot's messengers (<ea/>maotik) were an important instrumentality helping them in the administration of Kipsigis.
\par <#/>When the British came to Kipsigis, they invited the <ea/>orkoiyot to participate in '<ea/>barazas' along with th
e newly appointed chiefs and a number of the '<ea/>maotik' were appointed chiefs. <#/>However, it did not take long before the British realised that the <ea/>orkoiik were a potent force for disruption and were against the British rule. <#/>This sour relat
ionship <-_lead><+_led> to the deportation of three leading <ea/>orkoiik leaders, Arap Koilegei, Arap Boisio and Arap Kibuigut in 1913 (Mwanzi, 1977:151}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 )}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
. But the <ea/>orkoiik 'menace' continued with new leaders cropping up to challenge the British. <#/>Thi
s subsequently led to the deportation of a whole clan of the <ea/>orkoiik to Gwasi, in South Nyanza. <#/>This deportation <-/compaign>, which marked the peak of the conflict between the <ea/>orkoiik and the British rulers started with the passage of "The 
L
aibons removal ordinance" of 25th September, 1934 and it was completed in 1938 (KNA/PC/NZA/3/15/115). <#/>Later the <ea/>orkoiik were allowed back in Kipsigis and by 1962, all but a tiny 'handful of hardcore' <ea/>orkoiik had been returned to the district
 where they were issued with special passes and stationed in Kericho Township.

the Kipsigis <ea/>orkoiik, but their interaction with the colonialists has not been explored extensively compared to the historiography of the Nandi <ea/>orkoiik resistance [Magut (1969), Walter (1970) Huntingford (1950), Matson (1972), Ngeny (1970) and M
wanzi (1977)], the Kipsigis <ea/>orkoiik resistance is the least explored so far.
\par <#/>The arrival of the <ea/>orkoiik had far-reaching consequences on the social, economic and political institutions of the Kipsigis. <#/>Moreover, during the conquest and est
ablishment of the British rule, the <ea/>orkoiik played a pivotal role in resisting the colonial conquest and hegemony. <#/>It is only imperative that an extensive study is undertaken to examine the response of the Kipsigis <ea/>orkoiik to colonial rule. 
<#/>This, in the main, is the objective of the study, hence it reviews the related literature.
\par <#/>Ranger (1990), a specialist in African resistance, says that resistance leaders were legitimized through ritual recognition, and when the aggrieved African co
mmunity wanted to defend their sovereignty they naturally drew heavily on religious symbols and ideas. <#/>Some movements almost invariably had the advantage of spiritual leaders preaching the message of wider unity. <#/>This is also to be seen among the 
K
ipsigis whose religious leader Arap Koilegei and others who cropped up after him, championed the Kipsigis <ea/>orkoiik resistance to the imposition <-_f><+_of> the British rule. <#/>Ranger asserts that the view that only 'large scale' African politics res
isted, while 'small scale' societies could neither resist nor exploit colonial rule has been conclusively disproved.
\par <#/>Another writer Davidson (1968) writing on the same subject of African resistance to colonial conquest and rule, emphasizes that African 
resistance was a 'regular phenomenon' and that since virtually all states had some crucial interests or values which they were prepared to defend, they could resort, if necessary, to armed resistance.
\par <#/>Marks (1970) has shown in her study of Khoisan resi
stance in South Africa that 'non-centralised' people are just as capable of putting up a determined fight against white advance as centralised ones. <#/>It is the intention of this thesis to enrich the evidence showing that even the so called 'non-central
ised' communities could put up a spirited fight against European conquest and occupation just like the centralized ones.
\par <#/>Mwanzi (1977) asserts that before 1940, there were two administrations and religions in the Kipsigis country; that of the <ea/>orkoi
yot and his religion, and that of the British and their Christianity. <#/>He says that the <ea/>orkoiyot religion competed with christianity for allegiance among the Kipsigis, with the former outwitting the other, to an extent that the colonial government
 
had to physically remove the <ea/>orkoiik, to make Christianity and colonial administration effective. <#/>He adds that the success of the <ea/>orkoiik in their conflict with the Europeans emanated from the strength of the system they had built among the 
Kipsigis, with the introduction of a 'new civilization'.
\par <#/>In his other work, Mwanzi (1980) says that the Kipsigis <ea/>orkoiik undoubtedly offered the most vigorous and protracted resistance to the British rule. <#/>This was possible because of the intro
duction of the office of the <ea/>orkoiyot which brought a new civilization based on religion and of the initiative of an individual religious leader, which united the Kipsigis. <#/>He also adds that the treatment that the <ea/>orkoiik underwent under the
 colonial rule, and the fact that this once influential people had minimal influence on the Kipsigis colonial society that followed, shows the fate that befell those African communities who resisted colonialism. <#/>Although Mwanzi }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
(ibid) }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 argues that the de
portation of the <ea/>orkoiik from Kipsigisland ended the <ea/>orkoiik hegemony over Kipsigis society, this thesis asserts that the deportation of the <ea/>orkoiik did not signify the end of their influence over the Kipsigis, instead it led to the <-/adop
tation> of new strategies of anti-colonial protest. <#/></Infact> from their exile, the <ea/>orkoiik were able to influence a number of political happenings in Kipsigis to the amazement of the colonialists (DC/KER/1/9).
\par <#/>Hotchkiss (1937) in his work show
s the important role played by the Chief <ea/>orkoiyot, Arap Koilegei, in the Kipsigis response to the introduction of Christianity. <#/>He said of him, "behind the urbane mind, amiable exterior there was a clever mind, which was bent on circumventing the
 </whiteman> in those things that touched the customs and habits of the Kipsigis people" }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (ibid 115)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>Despite the fact that he has explained the circumstances which led to the expulsion of the <ea/>orkoiik to Gwasi, his work has dealt mainly with the Chi
ef <ea/>orkoiyot, thus ignoring the other important activities of the clan as a whole, especially after the deportation of their leaders in 1913. <#/>Indeed new leaders came up who continued to challenge the British rule in Kipsigis. <#/>It is the respons
e of the new leaders and the clan as a whole that the thesis intends to examine in detail.
\par <#/>Peristiany (1939) has dealt with the religious history of the Kipsigis, but lacks any work on the interaction between the Europeans and the <ea/>orkoiik. <#/>He h
imself being an anthropologist, his work is a descriptive "account of the customs and social institutions (of the Kipsigis) he personally witnessed". <#/>Thus it is non-historical. <#/>But as it may be recalled, anthropological work is an important source
 of historical data, therefore it will help in the research.
\par <#/>Although Peristiany has discussed the existence of the <ea/>orkoiik, he has been shallow. <#/>Evans Pritchard who introduced his work concurred with this view when he said, "Dr. <#/>Peristiany
 says little of the Laibon, prophets, who are in origin exiled <-/Masai>" (in Peristiany, 1939:XXVI). <#/>The study intends to fill a gap as it aims at examining the role of <ea/>orkoiik on the religious history of the Kipsigis during this period when Chr
istianity was being introduced, and whether the <ea/>orkoiik expulsion from the Kipsigisland was motivated by religious or political factors.
\par <#/>Orchardson (1961) looked at the Kipsigis from the anthropological point of view. <#/>He has described the Kipsi
gis customs and practices at all time. <#/>Historians look at an aspect of a society at a given time. <#/>His work does not include the interaction between the <ea/>orkoiik and the Europeans in Kipsigis. <#/>He takes the activities of the Talai clan of Ar
ap Koilegei "as necessarily evil", though he says '<ea/>orgoinotet' (the act of divinity) is not "necessarily evil and that the word <ea/>orkoiik applied to a very few <-/practioners> who claim to divine from words uttered by a gourd }{
\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (ibid 120)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>On the origin of the Kipsigis <ea/>orkoiik he says they belonged to the family of the "notorious maasai" who came to Kipsigis from Nandi shortly before the advent of the British rule in Kipsigis.

\par <#/>Manners (1967) in his work has also mentioned about the Kipsigi
s <ea/>orkoiik and as if to borrow a leaf from the other white authors, he calls them "witches or sorcerers". <#/>He takes them to be " a class of individuals, who had considerable status and who acquired great power over the Kipsigis in a variety of ways
". <X_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
<#/>Manners advances the idea that as these <ea/>orkoiik grew in number and influence they began to function as advisers and prophets who predicted the coming of natural catastrophes, defeat or success in battle, feast or famine. <#/>As to their relation
 to the colonial government, he argues that they were a potent force for disruption, and were opposed to and sabotaged government efforts. <#/>Manners like Mwanzi (1977) holds that efforts by the British at centralisation of control were constantly thwart
e
d by the <ea/>orkoiik and further that the British only achieved control over the Kipsigis when the strength and organisation of the latter had been shattered. <#/>He goes on to argue that if the <ea/>orkoiik had not been interfered with by the British in
 
their rule over the Kipsigis, the former would have established a family hegemony over the Kipsigis. <#/>Manners' work is however lacking in that it does not discuss the consequence which followed the advent of the <ea/>orkoiik in precolonial Kipsigis soc
i
ety. <#/>Also, it does not detail the processes that led to the expulsion of the <orth>kipsigis <ea/>orkoiik to Gwasi in South Nyanza, in the period between 1934 and 1938, nor does it examine the plight of the <ea/>orkoiik in their exile, which befell the
m due to their dynamic resistance against the foreign domination.
\par <#/>It is the intention of this thesis to fill the above stated gaps.
\par <#/>Langat (1969) notes that by 1914, the Kipsigis were firmly under the protectorate authority and Christianity rep
resented by the Friends Industrial Mission. <#/>Yet he says that for most of the colonial period the Kipsigis were less directly affected by the forces of the new order than for example, the people of the Nyanza and Central Provinces. <#/>This was perhaps
 
due to the presence of the <ea/>orkoiik who influenced the Kipsigis community against the British. <#/>On the question of the office of the <ea/>orkoiyot among the Kipsigis, he maintains that it was a late development and a short-lived one. <#/>Langat's w
ork goes up to 1914, thus he leaves out an important period in the history of the <ea/>orkoiik, when intense interaction between the British and the <ea/>orkoiik occurred.
\par }\pard\plain \s94\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \f16\lang1031 {\v\f0\lang2057 <#/>Korir (1974) concedes that the Kipsigis <ea/>orkoiyot, Arap Koilegei, was an extr

o
f the society (Mwanzi 1977). <#/>Korir also adds that whenever the local people wanted to respond to the colonial instructions, they first sought <ea/>orkoiyot's advice to which they strictly adhered. <#/>This shows the crucial role played by <ea/>orkoiik
 in Kipsigis affairs in relation to the colonialists. <#/>But Korir does not show the attitude of the Kipsigis who had embraced the British civilization and Christianity who would not necessarily consider <ea/>orkoiyot as an important figure.}{

\par <h> <#/>}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 Introduction}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  </h>
\par <#/>The term "<ea/>taarab" is derived from the Arabic root, "<foreign/>taarab" which may refer to a mus
ical feast or the playing of any musical instrument. <#/>In the contemporary East African scene, the term applies to "the saloon music form" (Boyd, 10) of the Swahili community which utilizes Swahili traditional lyrical forms such as <ea/>}{
\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 taarab}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  or <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 shairi }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 (quatrain) and <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 wimbo}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  (three-line song verse).
\par <#/>Although traditionally performed in ritual settings such as weddings and other important social and domestic occasions, the scope of the use of <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 taarab}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  among the Kenyan Swahili has widened to 
include the political, religious and other domains of social life. <#/>In fact, it is impossible to conceive of any important function in this community today, be it a political rally or a soccer match where the performance of <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 
taarab }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 does not feature.
 <#/>The local political leadership has realized the social influence of the form and has consistently tapped it in an effort to reach the widest possible audience in the multi-lingual and multi-cultural Kenya. <#/>The communicative force of the Swahili <
ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 taarab}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  does not only issue from its Kiswahili medium (the national language of East and Central Africa), but especially from the powerful employment of appropriate and apt choice of local metaphor or idiom.

\par <#/>In this article, a limited range of dominant political ideas and themes carried in the contemporary Kenyan Swahili <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 taarab}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 songs is explored. <#/>The term "theme" here is used to mean "the prominent, coherent element or characteristic ideas that seem to have some relevance to a social-or cultu
ral problem" (Biersteker, 1). <#/>Therefore, the consistent and related ideas in the song are treated as a theme. <#/>The major themes dealt with include, proestablishment mass indoctrination, nationalism, defiance and struggle for one's political rights.

\par <#/>Generally speaking, the information communicated through the medium of songs can be put into two broad categories: the purposive information, which has direct and immediate impact upon the audience and the consequential information, which is of a wide
r and more generalized nature }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (Omondi, 1-3)}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>The main goals of musical communication can further be classified into four broad types: provision of basic physical needs, socialization or imparting of a sense of conformity to societal norms or condemnatio
n thereof and <AmE/>fulfillment of emotive goals such as feelings, philosophical thinking, status planning, spiritual and emotional expression and the achievement of individual aesthetic goals such entertainment, enjoyment, personal commitment, spiritual 
renewal or inspiration. <#/>(Ibid., 7)
\par <#/>It is the contention here that as a popular oral form, the Swahili <ea/>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 taarab}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 song is concerned with everyday happening in the Swahili community and Kenya society and does not deal with any of the above goals in i
solation but rather, combines all of them in an inclusive manner. <#/>Therefore, a song referring to a religious moral may have a strong political and social message as well. <#/>The form has an <-/improvisory> character and uses a rhymed metrical style t
hat is deeply saturated with metaphorical symbolism often resembling a secret linguistic code (Ohly, 467}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 )}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>Clearly, therefore, the }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>taarab}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 form has rendered itself more readily as a medium of sensitive socio-political issues in the contemporary soci
ety than other traditional oral poetic forms such as <ea/>wimbo, which tend to be more strictly ritual-bound. <#/>This is in line with the nature of Swahili poetry whose communicative power lies not so much in its formal aspects, but rather its historical
 determinants, the language medium and the cultural and social values that it expresses" (Mulokozi, 46).
\par <#/>Any attempt to highlight and critique the political ideas in genre like the Swahili}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057  <ea/>taarab}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  song cannot, therefore, ignore the dynamic social an
d dialectic relationship that exists, between the artist, the society and the process of artistic creation. <#/>The Swahili }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>taarab}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 songs in the sample analyzed here are not treated as a mere reflection of the Swahili and Kenyan society in the artist's
 mind neither are they seen as representing the author's isolated, individualized, spontaneous and or subjective understanding of the political issues in contemporary Kenya. <#/>Rather, they are seen as social constructs that result from a concerted, cons
cious and dialectical process. <#/>As such, their value resides not in their embodiment of the genius of the individual artist but a reasoned and imaginative reflection of that genius. <#/>The socio-political criticism of the themes in the Swahili }{
\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>taarab}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  songs in this article is based on the assessment of </O> as the basic unit of analysis and as a product created in a given point in time within the dictates of a unique socio-cultural realities.
\par <#/>The songs cited are analyzed for clues to the broadest possible social meaning and each one is treated as an interrogative text, with a multiplicity of voices or meanings, which,}{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{
\f0\fs24\lang2057 together constitute their total meaning. <#/>In this sense, one could say that the songs are a viable and intelligible for
m through which an understanding of the Swahili and Kenya political culture and society could be understood. <#/>Presumably, in Swahili }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>taarab}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 songs, like other songs in the Swahili and African tradition in general, perform two basic functions: <AmE/>skillful use of language and communication of an apt social message.
\par <#/>Although Swahili songs are basically a form of local popular literature, they are not politically restricted to the immediate Swahili coastal social or cultural values but assume a na
tional and even regional character in their content. <#/>They reflect "the culture of the new nations of East Africa." (Arnold, 69). <#/>It is noteworthy that although the Kenyan Swahili <ea/>taarab poet may exhibit a deeper sense of political awareness, 
h
e or she should never be expected to accomplish the impossible. <#/>Although the artist criticizes and exposes the social ills afflicting the society, he or she faces some limitation personal as well as socio-political (Umma, 18). <#/>However, an examinat
ion of the songs with political themes in this study indicates that the }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>taarab}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 artists possess and cultivate a special talent: the ability to overcome conventional myths and to seek a broader and deeper view of life. <#/>They display the courage to pur
vey and parade common-place facts and to provide a new, fresh and challenging way of </intepreting> those facts and assumptions. <#/>For instance, in the verse below, the singer uses a metaphor of a group of drummers and dancers to allude to the handling 
of the affair of state by the political establishment of the day.

 artist has continued to play the role of a socio-

\par <#/>However, the evidence from a critical 
examination of a sample of Swahili <ea/>taarab songs indicates that, the contemporary artist's <-/>is commitment to serve the masses has been affected by both social and personal factors. <#/>Cultural and technological changes as well as the artists' self
-concept of their mission have all combined to dilute the degree of devotion and dedication to the common cause of their society.
\par <#/>The impact of monetary economy and its attendant pressure on the individual artist to fend for an ever growing number of de
pendants, has placed a big financial burden on the musicians. <#/>Since many of them are unemployed and have little or no formal education, they are poverty-stricken and often fall victim to the clever manipulation of the rich politicians who entice them 
a
nd make them compromise their professional ideals. <#/>As a result, many singers compose and sing songs praising the politicians and the establishment, with only the aim of winning the favour of their patrons. <#/>Additionally, many artists <AmE/>clamor f
o
r, and crave media coverage and often are prepared to tailor their songs to fit the dictates of the media officials, thus again, compromising the ideals of their art for personal material gain. <#/>In addition to their creative genius, the artist's abilit
y to adapt }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>taarab }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
songs is enhanced by the linguistic resourcefulness and prominence of Kiswahili as a medium of political expressions. <#/>Apart from being the recipient of many external cultural and linguistic inputs, Kiswahili is the only language f
rom the region, and indeed one of the few from the entire continent, whose poetry and literature have made an impact on the literature of other parts of the world (Shihabdin na Mnyampala, 67).

their professional ideals for personal gain, there are still a few who have faithfully carried the mantle of the defiant and radical classical Swahili political poets of the 18th and 19th centuries such as Muyaka Bin Haji (1776-1840) and A. A. A. Nassir (
1720-1820). <#/>It is amazing the }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>taarab }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
artists, in the face of the alienating individualism and materialism of the present day capitalistic life-style, have continued to explore freely and recreate suggestions of a better future, seek to establish sh

artists condone the idea of political patronage in the }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>taarab}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  movement or on the arena of national politics. <#/>This fact is evident in the following song which,}{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct}{

\par <#/>Likewise, leaders who are so blinded and mesmerized by their power and

 songs, as an outlet of the Swahili philosophical and linguistic creativity. <X_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>This view of the S

i
s affected not only by public expectations and understanding of poetry as an art and the role of an oral artist, but also by the norms and wishes of the powers that be. <#/>Therefore, the artist is called upon to conform to the rules of Swahili poetry, an
d to observe the social values, attitudes and morals of the community, while paying due attention to the national legal, religious and political mores. <#/>In passing judgement on the degree of political commitment of the modern Kenyan Swahili }{
\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>taarab}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  a
rtist, one must consider among other factors, the prevailing popular tastes, attitudes, and values, the role of other forms of verbal interaction that govern the lives of the bulk of the population such as popular music, dance songs, poetry, narratives an
d idioms. <#/>All these factors have a bearing on the Swahili }{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>taarab}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  artist as social-political communicator.
\par <#/>The Swahili community forms a kind of a micro-culture which is coherent and closely-knit on the one hand as well as socially and political
ly vibrant on the other. <#/>It is worth noting that the production of creative literature is but only one social activity in the segmentation of the complex cultural realm in a society. <#/>Like in any typical modern society, politics govern virtually ev
e
ry aspect of human life and endeavour among the Swahili and all other Kenyans today, right from the realm of personal life and family to the national arena. <#/>All societal institutions including organized religion, the law, culture, economics and govern
ment are organized around some form of political principle. <#/>In analyzing the political ideas, images and issues which are communicated to the general public via the Swahili }{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>taarab }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
songs in Kenya, it is essential to look at the level of the composer's authority, the socio-cultural environment in which the songs are composed, and the textual meaning of the songs.
\par <#/>Not only do Swahili }{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>taarab }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 poets compose patriotic songs to express what they perceive to be the desirable qualities of good politi
cal leadership, but they often take it upon themselves to expound, interpret, explain and endear the words of the leaders they consider to be models to the general public. <#/>Such poets assume that the average Kenyan does not fully grasp the meaning of, 
and the spirit behind the national mottos and "philosophies" of the establishment and needs such an "explanation". <#/>As a result of this tendency, many Swahili }{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>taarab}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 songs exist today in this tradition that purport to elaborate various "philosophical" pronouncements of the political leaders.
\par <#/>For instance, in the following example, Juma Bhalo, one of the leading }{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>taarab }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 composers in Mombasa, Kenya, "explains" the meaning of President Moi's motto of "<ea/>Nyayo" (footsteps):
\par }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 The frequent sh
ifts from one level of expression or meaning to another in these songs, like in most types of Swahili poetic compositions, makes it difficult to fathom their meaning totally. <#/>The main reason the artists prefer to use this type of elusive style to conc
e
al the real meaning of their compositions is, mainly to escape any form of official <-/censureship>, which is not uncommon at all in most African countries, and which has often led to punishment of the authors. <#/>Through <-/skillful> use of deep, but fa
m
iliar metaphor and symbolism, the artist <-_are><+_is> able to construct an objective reality in a fictional or poetic sense and to render this reality comprehensible and memorable (Goody, 23). <#/>This reality, which is fixed in the consciousness of the 
poet, is made to represent not just an abstract objective character of things but ordinary human nature.
\par <#/>Another popular way of representing political ideas in the Swahili }{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>taarab}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  songs is by use of rhetorical questions which, often appear in the fo
rm of refrains. <#/>This technique is employed by poets to provoke public reaction and response to the socio-political issues of the day. <#/>One can say such a rhetoric question compels, <-_required><+_requires> and even demands a response.
\par <#/>It is this
 fact that leads to the importance <-_if><+_of> questions in songs or poetry as carriers of vital messages. <#/>For example, in the following verse, the artist poses a double-edged question which on one hand is a challenge and on the other a rebuke.

\par }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 The short survey of a sample of contemporary Kenya Swahili }{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>taarab}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 songs in this discussion has attempted to make a comment on the extent of the artists' awareness and sensitivity to the socio-cultural, political 
and psychological environment in which they live and compose their songs. <#/>The examples of texts cited portray the songs' inherent force to entertain and convince the audience. <#/>The communicative strength of the songs lies in the appropriateness of 
their reference in the Swahili original. <#/>Swahili}{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  <ea/>taarab}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 songs share the heightened force of musicality and language with songs from other African communities. <#/>But, it must be stressed that the soul of the songs is not merely their musical quali
ties but rather their deep metaphorical or idiomatic language, which is as highly patterned as it is allusive. <#/>These characteristics of Swahili and African poetry and songs in general,}{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 have been discussed and analyzed in some detail by, among 
others, <names and dates> Finnegan (1970;1977), Chiragdin (1977), Abedi (1965), Abdalla (1979), Nketia (1955), Babola (1966), Kunene (1970), Awoor (1974), P'Bitek (1966; 1968; 1971 and 1982), Okpewho (1987). <#/>It is these linguistic and poetic propertie
s of the Swahili }{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>taarab}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  that enable the poets to camouflage their reference to certain politically sensitive issues that they discuss in their songs.
\par <#/>A close scrutiny of the language and the social setting of the Kenyan Swahili }{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>taarab}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  song see
ms to suggest contemporary songs fall into two main categories: those meant for direct popular consumption as a form of light entertainment, a type of "pulp literature" and the type which seems to constitute a serious dialogue on social issues based on de
e
ply reasoned facts and arguments. <#/>This dialogue seems to be restricted to the intellectual group made up by the artists themselves. <#/>In many instances, the poets raise issues, provoke a discussion and invite or challenge their colleagues to respond
.
\par <#/>Seen from the above perspective, therefore, political ideas in these songs could be interpreted as the particular individual artist's considered opinion, which is consciously expressed with a view to provoking a public debate in response or,}{
\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  
as a reaction to an observed public experience. <#/>The artists makes an attempt to delineate an aspect of the complexity that surrounds the whole spectrum of socio-political reality and composes a song to highlight that aspect according to his or her per
ception. <#/>Some of the commonly encountered political lyrics in the Swahili }{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>taarab}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 repertoire, often contain themes that are couched with political overtones although they may have such subject matter as,}{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  love, romance, moral, ethical issues
, or economic, religious, cultural and historic topics. <#/>Very often some of the most expressive and topical songs tell of stories based on purely personal life experience of the artist such as his or her career, love affair, jealousy neighbour, an <-/e
xploitive> employer and so forth. <#/>The song may then proceed to expound its subject by exposition, which may be at the literal, allegorical, or metaphorical level of expression.
\par <#/>This discussion, however, has not fully answered some basic questions re
lated to the treatment of political issues in these songs especially the socio-psychological factors governing the creation, communication and reception of certain political images communicated via the <ea/>taarab form. <#/>Further research into }{

'Feminism is a conscious effort to view things differently from the male perspective. <#/>It is a conscious effort to change the angle of perception.
\par <#/>I
t is a conscious effort to change the biased perception where the biological sex distinction of 'male' versus 'female' is used as a basis for elevating the social gender distinction of masculine (what is considered or believed to be manly) from feminine (
what is believed or considered to be womanly) even when the two are not inherently related.
\par <#/>I do not, however, see gender awareness as the need to bring equality or sameness between men and women\emdash something which is at least biologically impossible. <#/>
I see it as the need to be fair to both men and women in the society, to reconsider and abandon attitudes and beliefs that punish women merely on the basis of biological sex distinction.
\par <#/>The most important thing is not that }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 all }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 women be empowered and e
ncouraged to do what men do by acquiring masculine roles in the society, but that both sexes, male and female be FREE to choose what social roles they want to play in the task of nation building.
\par <#/>It is clear that no matter how rigid the categorization 
of activities and duties according to social gender distinctions of what is masculine and feminine, there will always be those who deviate from the norm. <#/>For example, some Kuwaiti women are breaking away from the social confines of Muslim ideology. }{
\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <quote_><X_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057

 Another example is the emergence of women in domains that are socially considered to be masculine such as Law, Medicine, Engineering or Academics\emdash positions of leadership and politics in Kenya today.
\par <#/>'There is no doubt that the biological difference between male and female is of considerable importance in hu
man societies. <#/>It seems equally beyond doubt that what is regarded as appropriate behaviour for males and females, other than that directly consequent on those biological differences (such as ... pregnancy, lactation), differs widely from one society 
to another. <#/>It is also readily observable that even where }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 social expectations are strong and explicit, }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
some variability in the behaviour of males and females does occur: many will conform to expected patterns of behaviour, but some expectations ... deviates will not.'
\par <#/>This suggests that social gender distinction of roles and behaviour patterns into masculine and feminine is not an automatic consequence of the biological sex distinction into male and female.
\par <#/>True democracy would be one where both 
men and women are allowed freedom of choice with regard to the manner in which they render their social contribution to the nation. <#/>Women who want to take on any of the social roles that the society perceives as masculine should be free to do so. <#/>
S
uch women would want no occupational restrictions on account of their gender. <#/>They would want to freely vary with the men in the spirit that they can do anything a man can do. <#/>Note here the case of women who do manual labour, those in the army and
 the police force. <#/>Other women might however not want complete free variation but only to be free to contribute in specific cases of the so called 'masculine roles' such as politics, leadership and decision-making.
\par <#/>The possibility that there might be women who are quite happy to stay in the roles that have been labelled 'feminine' and who would thus be completely lost in the masculine ones must also be considered.
\par <#/>When all the possible choices that can be made by women are considered, it is clear
 that their basis is ideological. <#/>If this were to happen, then women would be free to choose the world-view or sets of values, attitudes and beliefs through which to evaluate themselves in society.
\par <#/>The question of gender awareness and sensitivity i
s therefore one of FAIRNESS and not EQUALITY. <#/>It is a question of allowing the women to make the choice of whether to see the biological sex distinctions into male and female as controlling what sort of social gender roles they want to play, such as b
e
ing mothers as well as career women or whether to choose social gender roles irrespective of the biological sex differences (for example, join the army and not be married or a mother). <#/>It is asking for the prohibitive fixation of gender roles perpetua
ted by 'certain styles of life, belief, behaviours and endeavours' which keep women from mainstream development activities, to be abandoned. <#/>This is how women should be mainstreamed in the democratization process.
\par <#/>It is in this context that Maria Nz
omo, a political science lecturer at the University of Nairobi and AAWORD member, 'criticized Kenyan women appointed to key positions for failing to use their offices to the benefit of other women' in a paper titled 'Women in Politics and Public-Decision 
Making'. <#/>It is also the context in which the media not only challenged parliamentarians and other women leaders to come out strongly and speak their minds in the }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 Sunday Nation }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
of September 22, 1991, but also criticized the structure of women's organizat
ion in Kenya as 'elitist, not only in leadership, but also in structure.' Special mention was made of KMYWO as a grassroot organization that 'largely agrees with male-initiated policies that are not only anti-women but also those that largely act against 
the welfare of the majority, irrespective of gender.' The organization was seen 'to merely react to situations as if its policy is: others lead and we follow in matters of national interest.'
\par <#/>The tendency of some politicians and party leaders to use derogatory remarks in referring to women seems to confirm that women will always continue to be disadvantaged, because: }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <quote_><X_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
'...language is itself not only part of experience, but is intimately involved in the manner in which we construct and organize experience. <#/>As such it is never neutral, but deeply implicated in building meaning.'}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 </X><quote/>}{
\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Thus when the ideology 'the body of ideas characteristic of a particular society or sub-culture' has a gender bias the language(s) of that society will be equally biased.
\par <#/>The paper, however, noted that because language reflects culture, something which is quite dynamic and not static, those who speak different languages or different varieties of the same language 'have different ideologies which are reflect
ed in their language.'
\par }\pard\plain \s94\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \f16\lang1031 {\f0\lang2057 
<#/>People should therefore pay particular attention to the kind of language they use in relation to women. <#/>They should be aware that the language will establish (identify) their ideological stance, that is, beliefs, values and a
ttitudes. <#/>That the meaning of whatever they say will be derived from the actual choices that they make in using language (since it is not entirely random) in view of how the choice is related to the 'context in which they speak, the goal or purpose of
 the talk and what beliefs and values are implicated.'

\par <#/>'Explicit evaluation is seen when males who act in w
ays that help to perpetuate the subordinate status of women are referred to as 'chauvinists' or when feminists 'name certain attitudes and behaviours as sexist...a word that did not exist until recently.'
\par <#/>Implicit evaluation on the other hand takes the 'form of denying or attempting to discredit meanings that threaten the status quo.'
\par <#/>An example of a common response given by both men and women (male chauvinists and anti-feminist women) is that 'feminists' claim about sexist language is trivial and f

\par <#/>It is important to note in this regard that it was the recognition of gender as a basis of determining power relations in the society that led to the explicit evaluation of certain aspects of social reality as oppressive. <X_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
<#/>Such aspects were then named because language helped to correctly reflect their reality as part of experience.
\par <#/>Women therefore 'moved from Betty Friedman's initial problem that has no name to 'naming' that problem as 'Patriarchy' (new meaning for old word) or sexism (an entirely new word).'
\par <#/>Also relevant to this discussion is the controversy surrounding the co-occurrence of expressions or words such as:
\par - Ms and Mrs/Miss
\par - He or She and He
\par - Humankind and Mankind
\par - Chairperson and Chairman

lity by viewing things from the male perspective. <#/>In using these words, one thus makes an ideological choice where dominant values, beliefs and practices have a male bias. <#/>It is for this reason that, while 'the feminist who uses MS as a title for 
a
ll women is making a positive ideological choice (treating all women at par and not judging them on the basis of their marital status), the male chauvinist or anti-feminist woman sees it as a negative one. <#/>A choice that is anti-man (not based on marri

<#/>I am reminded here of the way in which a third dimension 'chairlady' is normally introduced to the chairperson/chairman distinction and the titles of Professor and/or Dr. <#/>perceived in relation to Mrs.
\par <#/>During one of o
ur meetings at AAWORD, Maria Nzomo observed that she preferred the term chairperson to 'chairlady'. <#/>By so doing she was making a positive ideological choice rejecting the patronizing contrast of whether it was a male or female on the chair.
\par <#/>The cha
irperson of the Department of Linguistics and African Languages at the University of Nairobi, Prof. (Mrs.) Lucia Omondi, is also usually addressed differently by people. <#/>Although some people address her as Professor (Mrs.) Omondi, the more common choi
ces are usually Professor Omondi, Mrs. Prof. Omondi, or Mrs. Omondi. <#/>The same pattern is seen in cases where other women hold the Dr. (Mrs.) title.
\par <#/>The use of Professor alone can be seen as acceptance that women can deviate from fixed gender roles. 
<#/>Since such a woman does not conform to the social preconceptions of gender, she is regarded as genderless. <#/>The use of Mrs. Prof. and Mrs. alone are different ways of implicitly evaluating gender roles in society. <#/>In both cases, there is the de
nial or attempt to discredit meanings that threaten the status quo. <#/>It is noteworthy that it is more noticeable (unnatural and unexpected) for a woman to become a Professor in a male-dominated society than it is for a woman to become someone's wife.

\par <#/
>Acknowledging that a woman is a Professor goes against the society's view of what is socially real. <#/>It threatens the status quo. <#/>The simpler thing to do is to ignore the Professorship, even if one is aware of it and to focus on the marital status
. <#/>As Mrs. <#/>Professor, her marital status is defined from the man's academic status, the wife of a Professor.
\par <#/>It is no wonder that contemporary feminism (an approach that challenges the domination of the society by men) has placed a lot of attention on the issue of socialization into gender roles and of sexist discourse (speech patterns).

oks at how the actual choice of what to say in a particular context is indicative of the divergent ways that Kenyans perceive the role of women. <#/>There are certain cultures where women are elected into positions of leadership by both men and women in s

iterally Awuor the daughter of a man is used to describe a woman with what is perceived as manly traits ... and has a negative connotation even when the said traits are positive (e.g. leadership ability and strength of character).'
\par <#/>Yet it is the same culture that first elected a woman, Grace Onyango, to parliament in 1969 and acknowledged that women could excel in what had originally been seen as a male preserve.
\par <#/>Referring to Grace Onyango, Chelagat Mutai and Phoebe Asiyo, the }{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 Sunday Nation }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 of February 22, 1991 reports that: }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <quote_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057

\par <#/>It is especially significant to note Phoebe Asiyo's example of h
er experience as member of parliament for Karachuonyo with regard to the social construction of gender roles. <#/>At a meeting held at the Hilton Hotel, Nairobi on January 4, 1992, she said that sometimes at the <ea/>}{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 baraza }{
\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 (meeting) elders would, while addressing her as 'Mama'\emdash request her to ask the women to leave the meeting because they wanted to discuss serious matters.
\par <#/>We can only account for this apparent contradiction by acknowledging that cultures and languages (in this case the Luo one) can hol
d different world-views of women. <#/>A culture can be sexist and reflect preconceptions about what is expected or not of women, but also accept deviation from those preconceptions.
\par <#/>This is the spirit in which we understand and agree with the following contributions by Kenyan men and women to the subject of Gender:
\par <#/>During a luncheon by the Federation of Women Lawyers held at the Hilton Hotel, Nairobi, on September 27, 1991, Margaret Githinji, the permanent secretary in the ministry of commerce made 
it clear that 'responsibilities should go hand-in-hand with qualifications and experience' and not gender issues\emdash positive discrimination or otherwise. <#/>(Our addition).
\par <#/>Neither the men nor the women should be discriminated against when assigning resp
onsibility. <#/>She therefore said 'I do not want to see a situation where men accuse women for being promoted because they are women. <#/>It is within the same world-view that Beth Mugo of the Kenya Business and Professional Women's Club (KBPW) wants 'wo
men, men and the whole society to support capable women to parliament.'
\par <#/>We also see G.B.M. Kariuki's observation at the same ceremony that 'women must be seen as equal partners who play a complementary role' in this light.
\par <#/>The chairperson of the Kenya Chapter of the International Federation of Women Lawyers, Grace Githu, called 'for respect and dignity to women' since 'the differences between a man and a woman are only biological, that's all.' The editor of }{
\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 Parents }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 magazine, Eunice N. <#/>Mathu urged politicians to adopt a different world-view. <#/>Specifically to 'find other analogies\emdash 
because 'although Kenyan women have low voices, they deserve respect first and foremost as Kenyans and human beings who are equal to men and secondly, as mothers, wives
 and sisters.' City lawyers, Martha Njoka and Rachelle Omamo recognized the sexist stand of these leaders as intended to perpetuate gender inequalities, and Jane Kiano (then deputy chairperson of the Nairobi City Commission) insisted that 'women should be
 seen as equal partners in national development.'

\par <#/>The }{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 Kenya Times }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 of September 27, 1991 reported that when asked in Lusaka about ways to empower women, Harriet Woods, president of the National Women's Political Caucus (NWPC) said: }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
<quote_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057

can establish our own priorities and give all the women skills so that they can be effective in running for office.'}{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <quote/>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
\par <#/>The need for dialogue between men and women of different worldviews as a strategy, in addition to making law reforms, is demons
trated by the fact that merely formalizing a law does not cause a societal change in attitude. <#/>Commenting on the question of male attitudes towards women in the United States, Harriet Woods notes that although 'the law clearly bars formal discriminati
on against women ... problems exist in the area.'
\par <#/>Women, therefore 'need nuts and bolts training\emdash how-to courses in the mechanics of how you run for office, how you get people to support you when you are a woman.'
\par <#/>I would argue that one way of doing 
this is for women to demonstrate in their use of language an awareness that people have different world-views, some of which are based on variables such as age, tradition, religion, mobility and economic status and cannot therefore change overnight.

\par <#/>As Wahome Mutahi reports in the }{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 Daily Nation }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 of September 20, 1991 }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <quote_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057

\par <#/>Perhaps it is because this aspect is not emphasized in our gender sensitization and awareness creation, that:
\par <#/>'KMYWO and other women's organizations have not done much towards the mental liberation of women. <#/>They have not set up the mechanism that makes women at grassroots level have the courage and ability to know when and how to say 'No'.
\par <#/>Women at that
 level should know when and what to say no to 'not only to matters that relate to gender, but also other inhuman practices,' as this is 'the only way that will eventually make positive achievement for women in Kenya ... as it is now, KMYWO, and other wome
