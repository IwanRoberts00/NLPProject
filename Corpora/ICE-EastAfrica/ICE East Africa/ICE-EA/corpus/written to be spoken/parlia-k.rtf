\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Ogur}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 : <#/>On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. <#/>When I was out a little while ago, the Minister for Tourism and Wildlife made a stat

le to understand how they should make use of insurance companies in the country, but we shall also be promoting the growth of insurance funds. <#/>At the moment, there is a lot of robbery on those who have taken out insurance by the insurance companies. <
#/>Many insurance companies, during the time of paying compensation, under-value whatever had been insured.
\par <#/>For instance, when the insured are involved in accidents---

 (Mr. Shikuku): <#/>Order! <#/>Mr. Nassir and hon. Nooru, I will not repeat this warning again. <#/>We can only have one hon. Member on his feet at any one time. <#/>Hon. Nassir and hon. Nooru, would you, please, make efforts to observe that?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. J.N. Mungai}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
: <#/>I was saying that underpayment of compensation with regard to accident claims should be looked into seriously. <#/>We have had cases where people have insured their vehicles but when they claim compensation as a result of accidents, 
they are underpaid. <#/>I would like to call upon the Minister to make sure that impartial officers from the Ministry are called in to do the valuation of such claims and not just appointees of those insurance firms. <#/>This way, the insured will not be 
robbed in broad daylight.
\par <#/>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I gave an example of a person who complained to me that he had insured his vehicle for about Kshs500,00 but when he had an accident three months later, he was compensated by only Kshs150,00. <
#/>This is just quite impossible. <#/>Such a person was driving his own vehicle and I am sure the depreciation of such a vehicle was so minimal that it should not have made the owner lose Kshs250,00 within two months. <#/>That is why I am saying that we m
u
st educate our people to know how insurance companies operate their business, especially when it comes to paying compensation. <#/>The levy we are going to introduce through this Bill must used to educate the insured so that they are not under-compensated
 by insurance companies.
\par <#/>It is also important to educate unsophisticated people in rural areas on the use of insurance. <#/>This is important because most of the our people in rural areas are peasants and grow the food that is usually used all over the 
country, especially in urban centres. <#/>They also grow staple crops like maize, wheat and so on. <#/>But because they do not understand that food crops can also be insured, when drought strikes they lose both the entire crop and the investment in it. <#
/
>If such peasants were educated through chiefs' <ea/>barazas, political rallies and other non-governmental <-/fora>, they would know it is necessary to insure the crops they grow. <#/>This is why I am suggesting that this levy should be used to educate bo
th insurance personnel and also small-scale farmers in rural areas.
\par <#/>I am sure that some of those who live in rural areas are fully informed about the insurance of their farms and buildings. <#/>However, such people have been having problems in getting i
nsurance compensation when calamities occur. <#/>So, we should go further and educate agricultural officers on how insurance compensation is determined in order to prevent insurers from under-valuing farmers` crops for compensation purposes. <#/>It is als
o very important for such officers to be assisted by valuation officers from other Ministries.
\par <#/>As I said earlier, there are many small-scale and large-scale farmers who understand the use of insurance but who are not covered by insurance. <#/>This is why it is important for the Minister to enlighten us on what he really means by \rdblquote 
natural calamities\'94. <#/>We thought natural calamities could be anything like heavy rains, lightning and so on. <#/>But you find that right now very many of our people in the ru
ral areas have lost property through tribal clashes. <#/>Some of them had insured their crops, but if the insurance companies will classify this loss as resulting from a natural calamity, this will be very oppressive. <#/>This is because we know that what
ever has happened in the tribal clash areas has not been a natural calamity; it is has been a calamity created by a few people who want to perpetuate themselves in power.

\par <#/>There is a quorum now. <#/>Mr. J.N. Mungai, you can continue.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. J.N. Mungai}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 : <#/>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was trying to say that we must differentiate between natural
 calamities and calamities created by some people because of reasons best known to themselves. <#/>I am on the point of mentioning that we have had tribal clashes recently in the Rift Valley, which are continuing even now. <#/>I am wondering whether such 
clashes can be classified as a 'natural calamity'.
\par <#/>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we know that a car can roll and crash when it is being driven. <#/>But we also know that that can happen either because the driver is driving carelessly or something e
lse has happened and made the driver lose control of the vehicle. <#/>That is referred to as an accident. <#/>But you will realise that many of our farmers in the rural areas who have had to insure things like motor vehicles, homes, crops and animals have
 
suffered big losses. <#/>We would like to be told by the Minister, when responding to Members` views, whether this will be considered to be a natural calamity. <#/>To me this is not a natural calamity; I would say it is a calamity created for the unfortun
ate people in the rural areas. <#/>I would even go further and ask the Minister to order insurance companies to pay for any losses that have been incurred in the tribal clash-torn areas.
\par <#/>I say so not forgetting somebody like hon. Keah there who is point
ing at me and who I am sure is going to respond to this Bill. <#/>If people in the clash areas are not compensated then it will mean that the Government is supporting the oppression of our people. <#/>These people have insured their property but the Gover
n
ment has been unable to protect the lives of the people and their property. <#/>People have lost lives and property worth millions of shillings. <#/>We want this matter to be investigated thoroughly before it is decided upon by the insurance companies, so
 that the people know whether they are going to lose or gain.
\par <#/>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we must also be told whether those who have been involved in inciting such violence will be prosecuted. <#/>They must be prosecuted because they have admitt
ed that they have been involved in inciting people to violence. <#/>When I say so, I am talking about a person like <?/>ole Ntimama. <#/>I am sure that many hon. Members may say that <?/>ole Ntimama stated in the House here - and he also repeated it outsi
d
e this House and we have it on record; it was published in the local dailies - that they were going to strive for the rights of their people in their own areas. <#/>But those rights of their people also affect the rights of others, which rights were insur

 Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you can see, the Bill says that the levy can be paid in instalments. <#/>But as you are aware, there is no business in the country. <#/>If there is any business, it is so little that it is not favourable. <#/>I would like to urge 
the Minister to withdraw the issue of penalty because the climate as far as business is concerned is not favourable. <#/>It is important that the Minister considers the current economic conditions very carefully. <#/>It is okay to say that the levy can be
 
paid in instalments, but somebody can fail to remit the money on time due to unfavourable conditions in business. <#/>So, it is important that such factors are taken into consideration. <#/>Instead of opting for the penalty, why do we not just say that th
e
 money must be paid, and if somebody fails to pay he is sued to make sure that he pays it? It is important to bear in mind that whatever we do in this House, we do it for the welfare of our people. <#/>We do not do things here just to ensure that the Gove
r
nment makes money by collecting taxes from its own people when the times are not conducive for our people to make money. <#/>The times are very rough, not only for our people at home but internationally. <#/>We should not discourage our people from partic
i
pating in an industry like this one by penalising them when they fail to pay. <#/>Let us try to assist them so that they can survive during these hard economic times. <#/>If we are not careful, it is quite possible that many people might have to withdraw 
by selling part of their assets. <#/>They might even withdraw their participation in the insurance industry because of these penalties, particularly during this time when we are facing very hard economic conditions.

are trading while insolvent and continue to do this because they are politically patronised. <#/>A case in point is the Kenya National Assurance Company which, common knowledge has it, is trading while insolvent and questions have been asked as to whether
 
it should continue doing this. <#/>Should this particular company continue trading until it finally becomes solvent? This question is being asked by other insurance companies. <#/>What will the rest of the industry be required to pick up should any defici
ency arise in the event of a winding-up of the Kenya National Assurance Company?
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was the Kenya Motor Insurance Pool that used to exist some years back, and it is the wish of the industry that this pool be revived because it was a very useful tool.

\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Speaker}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 : <#/>Order, hon. Members! <#/>The House has already been informed that when an hon. Member is on his feet no other Member shall be on his or her feet except when m
oving from one place to another. <#/>I would ask all hon. Members who stand up unnecessarily in the House that they are in direct contravention of the Standing Orders. <#/>We would like to obey all the Standing Orders because that is what makes Parliament
.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. R.K. Mungai}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
: <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in recommending the revival of the former Kenya Motor Insurance Pool, it is suggested that it should be under a new charter and under changed circumstances as we have today. <#/>For instance, the Commissioner of 
Insurance should have very little say on the running of the pool, except in his role as the regulator of the industry.
\par <#/>It is the view of the insurance industry that the Commissioner of Insurance has so much power that the industry is at his mercy. <#/>
This is contrary to the whole process of liberalisation, free trade and privatisation. <#/>A lot of information is given to the Commissioner of Insurance in various forms that are submitted to him annually. <#/>It is suggested that those forms provide so 
m
uch data and information that it is almost impossible for the Commissioner to utilise that information effectively. <#/>It is also common knowledge that the Commissioner does not have adequate staff to analyse, digest and utilise that information. <#/>It 
is, therefore, suggested by the industry that the forms should contain only information that can be effectively utilised by the Commissioner.   
\par <#/>Regarding the training levy, the idea of setting up the Insurance Training College is in the right direction
 and the industry is happy about it. <#/>However, it is recommended that the college should have adequate and qualified lecturers and administrators; otherwise, it will not serve the envisaged purpose. <#/>It is also recommended that the institute should 
have a relevant comprehensive curriculum developed, which should change with time. <#/>The industry would like this kind of curriculum to be approved by the industry itself rather than the Government machinery.
\par <#/>The insurance industry should control the running of the college and not the Government in terms of what is to be taught and who is to teach there. <#/>The industry has trained and experienced lecturers who should be employed to do that.
\par <#/>It is also suggested that the college should explore ver
y, very urgently the possibility of running actuarial courses locally. <#/>Currently, all consulting actuaries are trained abroad and it would be in the interest of the insurance industry to have them trained here.

\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. R.K. Mungai}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 : <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my last point on this Bill is that the levy should be based on some reasonable basis; that is to say, ability to pay. <#/>This could be based o
n the total premiums generated. <#/>The insurance industry should consider those points about the requirement on training and the assessment of the trading levy, and the Government too should give its assurance.
\par <#/>With those few remarks, I beg to support.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Dr. Lwali-Oyondi}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 : <#/>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.
\par <#/>The Bill is quite clear and I support it. <#/>I support it because in clause 191(i) (3), it talks of charging levy at the rate of 0.35 per cent. <#/>That is quite reasonable. <#/>The Government h
as often tried to charge too much in many areas through VAT. <#/>They are trying to get 18 per cent and but they end up losing everything. <#/>An example is the VAT charged on spare parts. <#/>We talked about it here and the Minister did not quite agree w
i
th our sentiments, but to tell him the truth, spare parts are being bought without receipts and in this way, the Government is losing revenue. <#/>If they had charged 5 per cent on them, they would have received all the money collected. <#/>If you go in f
o
r too much capital levy, you will end up with nothing. <#/>If you go in for too much profit, your turnover will be little, and any trade depends on high turnover but not the actual profit per unit. <#/>In this case, I would commend the Minister for puttin
g that very reasonable percentage, and I am almost certain that nobody will be unable to pay it.
\par <#/>If everybody pays, the Minister will have enough money to run the colleges. <#/>This should be an example to all other Ministries. <#/>There is no need of h
aving big figures and end up with nothing. <#/>The monthly payment might involve a lot of paperwork in accordance with Clause 197 - monthly payment. <#/>I would have suggested that probably there should be half yearly payments so that we do not have to ha
ve too much paperwork and the officers concerned will have less work in demanding for this money on monthly basis.
\par <#/>I hope that the Minister will use this training levy for the right purpose. <#/>This money should not be embezzled or used by people to bo
ast about in <ea/>Harambee meetings. <#/>A lot of money is being collected from toll stations, but nobody knows where it goes to. <#/>There are rumours, and I do not want to be a rumourmonger, that some people grab this money and---

 complained that it is not getting enough money from toll stations and therefore, it is asking that the system employed in collecting levy should be put into operations at petrol stations. <#/>Why do we have insurance companies? Insurance is supposed to p
r
ovide comfort when a natural or an artificial calamity befalls one. <#/>It is futile for a doctor to try to plaster somebody's finger after he has been completely flattened by a lorry. <#/>We are talking of insuring people when the Government itself is no
t insuring the lives of people. <X_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
<#/>It is no use talking about people getting crushed by cars and getting compensated when you cannot insure the lives of <ea/>wananchi; it does not make sense to talk of dealing mercilessly with <ea/>wananchi who have bo
ught their <ea/>shambas in various places according to the law. There is no need to talk of insurance when the Ministers are instigating <ea/>wananchi to be killed, their houses burnt and their cattle stolen.
\par <#/>For example, in Nakuru District, cattle, particularly in the Rongai area, are systematically and deliberately being stolen, and chiefs and others are not taking any action about that. This is a way of scaring off people so that they sell their <ea/>}{
\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 shambas}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  to the people who have an interest in them
. All these clashes we hear of are all about people who want to scare off others and those who want to kill other people. Now we are talking of insurance, but why can we not start with people's lives before we talk of insurance? This amounts to nothing, a
nd that is why I said it is like a doctor who is dealing with a broken finger when the whole fellow has been flattened by a bus or a lorry.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you cannot be insured without life, and water is life. There is one thing they call the National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation which is now cutting off water from towns such as Nakuru and making sure that no <ea/>}{
\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 dawas}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  are put in the water. So, what is the use of insuring that man when he is going die of cholera or typhoid? These are the basic things that the Government has to do.}{\f0\fs24\lang2057

\par }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Dr. Lwali-Oyondi}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 : Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am building up my point, having argued from the point o
f view that insurance is supposed to make our lives better and ensure that whenever there is any calamity arising, we are compensated for any loss. It has something to do with life and property, and that is why I am saying that it will come to nought if w
e
 do not make sure that our citizens are well supplied with water. What is the use of insurance, anyway, to somebody who is dying from cholera? So, I am just connecting the two, that you start with good management and then you go to luxuries like insurance
.
 Life has to come first, then you go to luxuries like insurance. You cannot begin insuring yourself unless you are rich enough. Therefore, in this case, insurance is a luxury because it is not absolutely necessary for life. But water is essential and abso
lutely necessary for life and if you do not get good water, you are likely not to be around to be insured. That is how I am connecting the two, and I hope the hon. Member is clear about that. 
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, insurance premiums are too high, particula
rly motor vehicles insurance premiums. I am also certain that most of these Members of Parliament cannot afford comprehensive insurance. Many of those hon. Members whose vehicles have been involved in accidents - whenever they have been unfortunate enough
 
to be involved in accidents - are unlikely to have their cars compensated for. Many, I am almost certain, are not able to buy a car right now with the salary they have. Therefore, if there is no comprehensive insurance, many of us will be travelling by <e
a/>}{\i\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 matatus}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  very soon. I therefore think that the premiums that are too high are very dangerous to motorists in that most people are likely to take the risk of driving without insurance.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government ought to be out of the insurance b
usiness. The Kenya National Assurance Company has been completely emasculated and ruined by corruption. Money has actually literally been stolen from it and, therefore, it is completely useless. I hope the Government backs out of it and leaves insurance t
o private insurers.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while talking about insurance, it should be borne in mind that shops are also insured. We insure whatever we have, so that in case calamities such as fire befall us, we can start from a slightly better position than being ruined}{

\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kiliku: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Thank you very much Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. <#/>I was jus
t asking the Minister to explain why the Miritini EPZ in Mombasa has not taken off now despite of the fact that it was to be the second phase of the implementation of the EPZ. <#/>Unfortunately, the introduction of EPZ into the country has, so far, benefi
tted very few members of the business community because the Government has not educated the people in this country as to what is an EPZ.
\par <#/>Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, one of our problems with the EPZ is that the Government must make land available for other 
developments like transport, health clinics and outing facilities within the EPZ. <#/>These are the things which must be available because if they are not there then it will be a problem for the workers there. <#/>The Government should also come out with 
a
 policy as to whether the workers within the Export Processing Zones (EPZs), especially Kenyans, will be paid their salaries in foreign currency. <#/>Since all business transactions within the EPZs is 100 per cent done through foreign currency, the Kenyan
 
workers in those Zones should be paid in foreign currency. <#/>The investors have been allowed to operate foreign exchange accounts in the commercial banks and, therefore, the Kenyan workers in those Zones should be paid in foreign currency so that they c
an also benefit.
\par <#/>Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, of late when heads of government, either presidents or prime ministers come here they are taken to Sameer Industries. <#/>I do not know the relationship between the Government and this industry. <#/>Why should v
isitors be taken to only this one industry and not others if you have to show what is manufactured in this country? At Athi River we have industries within the EPZs. <#/>That is a question mark because there must be something between the Government and Sa
m
eer Industries, whereby visitors from all over the world are taken. <#/>Even once a Minister for Commerce and Industry has been appointed the first thing he does is to go to Sameer Industries and that is where they take their guests. <#/>They have forgott
en that we have other industries in this country.

<#/>Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have been talking about investments in this country, but the problem is that the <-/implementers> of Government policies have been scaring off potential investors from coming 
to this country. <#/>Most of the biggest enemies of this country are Ministers who have contributed to the economic problem we are having in this country today. <#/>If you do not take a kick-back in the Government, then you are not a good Minister. <#/>As
 
I am talking now most of the investors are going to Uganda and the others are going to Tanzania because of the kick-back policy in this country. <#/>Unless we change our attitude towards investors, they will not come to this country. <#/>For example, as I
 
am talking today, and the Minister for Tourism and Wildlife is here, there is no land available in either Mombasa or Nairobi for the construction of a tourist hotel. <#/>The looters of the land have taken all the land, including parking areas, and have le
f
t nothing for development. <#/>Where are we telling investors to go if we have grabbed all the land in urban areas. <#/>In Mombasa they have taken graveyards! <#/><ea/>Wameuza <ea/>makaburi. <#/>When you say that you are encouraging investors, where are t
hey going to invest?

\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Shikuku}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 : <#/>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. <#/>Those rules talk
 of information, and the hon. Member on the Floor can give way to the hon. Member who wants to give the information. <#/>But when the hon. Member stood up he did not say what he was standing up on. <#/>The word \ldblquote clarification\rdblquote 
 is very new to me.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Deputy Speaker}{\f0\fs24\lang2057

\par 
\par <#/>\ldblquote A Member who is speaking may permit interaction by another Member who wishes to elucidate a point. <#/>Such Member will attempt to rise with the words \ldblquote Will the hon. Member permit me....\rdblquote  or \ldblquote

\par <#/>These are all variances. <#/>The Rule continues:

\par <#/>I think the hon. Member was seeking for elucidation.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kiliku}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 : <#/>Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am talking about land as one of the factors of production beca

\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Shikuku}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 : <#/>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. <#/>I thought what the hon. friend of mine wanted to do
 was to ask the hon. Member speaking about his statement to the effect that the land in Mombasa has been so grabbed, including graveyards. <#/>I thought I heard the hon. Member say so. <#/>Could he tell the House or substantiate which graveyard has been g
rabbed by the land grabbers?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kiliku}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 : <#/>Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Shikuku out of this House for five years and fortunately, I was already in the House and so my experience and his are almost the same.
\par <#/>I am going to substantiate that stateme
nt. <#/>In Mikindani and Kwa Sheikh, there was land set aside for a graveyard, but the municipal council sold it. <#/>In my constituency in Vokoli and Port Reitz there was also land for a graveyard but it was also sold. <#/>If this is what has happened in
 
my constituency, how about in other constituencies since mine is only one out of 188 constituencies? Even toilets are being sold. <#/>In Changamwe there is somebody who is paying rent for a toilet to the municipal council because he is sleeping in the toi
l
et. <#/>Even the area meant for sewerage is being sold. <#/>I am very serious about this. <#/>They are taking everything. <#/>Even now they are blocking roads so that the land where the road passes can be sold. <#/>If this is what is happening where are w
e
 going to get land for public utility? In Mombasa, there is no land for schools because every piece of land has been sold. <#/>The Government is responsible for this because no individual people give land. <#/>It is the Commissioner for lands on behalf of
 the Government that is responsible for grabbing land in this country. <#/>In the future, we may not have schools or investors coming to the country because there is no land.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Shikuku}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 : <#/>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am now gettin
g enlighten on the fact that graveyards have been grabbed by this Government. <#/>I thought the hon. Member went further and talked about a sewerage. <#/>This is very interesting. <#/>This matter is very serious if land meant for sewerage, toilets, and ro
ads reserved can be grabbed. <#/>Could the hon. Member go further and enlighten us on the seriousness of the issue? Which sewerage was grabbed?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kiliku}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 : <#/>Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to refer hon. Shikuku to the Town Clerk of Mombasa and 
ask him about the public toilets in Mombasa. <#/>They have all been closed. <#/>I am talking about those public toilet near Mabongo Health Centre which the outpatients used to use. <#/>They have been rented out and somebody is living there. <#/>Is it not 
the municipal council which has rented them out? Hon. Dr. Wameyo can confirm that somebody grabbed land in Kisauni. <#/>That is why I said I have gained a lot of experience.
\par <#/>I support the Bill. <#/>The Bill is empowering the Minister to declare any plac
e in this country to be an EPZ. <#/>We may have some people who may buy land from the individuals and prepare their cheques according to the standard set by EPZ. <#/>Therefore, if the Bill states that the Minister is empowered to declare any place an EPZ 
o
n the recommendation of the EPZ Authority, he should do so. <#/>The main problem is with our Ministers. <#/>This authority might end up making our Ministers looters. <#/>If the IPZ authority has recommended that somebody can invest anywhere why should he 
go to see the Minister?

: <#/>The issue of Goldenberg is still fresh in our minds. <#/>Such powers cannot make sense. <#/>Why should one go to see the Minister when we want that money? We want to earn foreign exchange. <#/>Those are the draw backs of investment in this country. 
<#/>Why should one go to the Minister if there is an authority? This is an authority which has experienced, people who know what EPZ is. <#/>We want to get foreign exchange and investments to extend our economic growth in this country.

\par 
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kiliku: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 I am supporting the Bill, but not the clause that states that once you are recommended by the EPZ you should go to see the Minister. <#/>There is no need for doing so. <#/
>A Minister can attend the function as a ceremonial guest of honour. <#/>Those who have invested in EPZ are given the conditions that more than 60 per cent of products produced within the EPZ must be exported from this country to earn foreign exchange. <#
/
>We want to know from the Minister: <#/>What methodology he is going to use to ensure that this is applied. <#/>Is he going to know about it only through the customs officials? That is not enough. <#/>We do not want people affiliated to EPZ to go and manu
facture products here or to use privileges provided only to use the same products for our domestic consumption. <#/>We need foreign exchange.
\par <#/>We want the Minister to give us the criteria which they are going to use to know whether this particular countr
y has exported more than 60 per cent of the products to all these countries. <#/>The privileges given under EPZ on investment were passed here. <#/>I think this Government has already directed what should happen as far as investments are concerned and tha
t
 is very good. <#/>You are given ten years grace before you can pay tax. <#/>We want to know if the EPZ are given freedom to bring their products here especially the raw materials, duty free. <#/>There must be a method to check whether what they are going
 
to bring to this country as raw materials is duty free and if they are not going to sell the same products duty free to the domestic market. <#/>There must be a lot of corruption involved here. <#/>I am appealing to the Minister that anybody who is invest
ing in EPZ should carry out a visibility study showing the amount of money involved in foreign exchange, the kind of business he is going to conduct and the number of employees he is going to employ from the labour market in Kenya.
\par <#/>In that feasibility s
tudy, the capital to be invested, the number of people to be employed, the number of expatriates to be involved and the labour requirements should be indicated. <#/>This is because one of the advantages that we are going to get by introducing EPZ is that 
investors will be encouraged to come and invest in our country, and also provide employment for Kenyans. <#/>Currently, we have many secondary school leavers and university graduates who have been <-/tarmacking> for the last five years or more.
\par <#/>Therefor
e, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I appeal to the Government not to allow anybody to bring expatriates and give them jobs which can be managed by our people. <#/>We have qualified engineers and other necessary manpower required in this country. <#/>In fact, in 
m
y opinion, Kenya has some of the most educated people in the African continent today and, therefore, we should not just allow anybody to establish a factory in the EPZ without first producing a viable feasibility study and implementing it. <#/>The Governm
e
nt should be very careful on this matter and take into account the money to be involved; it should not be a matter of somebody with just $500 as initial capital being allowed by the Government. <#/>Of course, we have many willing investors, but the proble
m is the unavailability of land. <#/>That is the biggest problem we have and I would like the Government to accept the fact that there is no land for EPZ.
\par <#/>Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other problem we are having at present is that we have many taxes att
ached to the consumer goods. <#/>Today, because of the Value Added Tax, Sales Tax, Custom Duty and other taxes, that package of taxation has made consumer goods in this country very expensive. <#/>If we want more investors to come to this country, it woul
d
 be better to waive some of the conditions which may work against the interests of the investors. <#/>Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, another point which I would like to emphasise is that we want the investors in this country to be free from interference from wh
a
tever quarters. <#/>They should not be forced to take up partnerships with people they do not want. <#/>Let them appoint whoever they want. <#/>However, the truth of the matter is that the land for EPZ in Nairobi has been taken up by just a few go-downs; 
t
he whole land is owned by private people. <#/>Why is this so? There are only a few go-downs of some agencies, while the Government is making Sameer appear like a Prime Minister of this country. <#/>Even high ranking Government officials visit Sameer Indus
t
ries! <#/>Why is it that only Sameer industries have been declared EPZ? The whole land from here to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport was meant to be an EPZ and the Government was to provide infrastructure in those areas, but now, only a few people who 
have constructed their go-downs there are the ones being referred to as EPZ. <#/>Why is this so and what about all the other land?
\par <#/>Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in Miritini, the Government was to use Ksh.500 million to develop a EPZ there. <#/>But the same p
iece of land which was declared an Export Processing Zone has been given to individuals. <#/>Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sure you have visited Mombasa and seen a signpost which reads \ldblquote Welcome to Mombasa\rdblquote 
, That area, which had been declared an EPZ, has be
en allocated to individuals now. <#/>I do not know how the Government is going to construct the go-downs there. <#/>In fact, the land has been allocated to foreigners; not local people. <#/>Hon. Mbela gave the land to councillors from Taita Taveta Distric
t
, and the other land - more than 50 acres - was given to the Rwanda Government. <#/>But I understand that for the last five years, the Rwanda Government has not developed it. <#/>May be the Government officers may come in, but I warn them that I have alre
a
dy alerted the people there. <#/>If there is no development by the Rwanda Government or the EPZ, nobody else is going to be given that land, by hook or crook. <#/>This is because the land was taken from the local people - the squatters - and given out, an
d
 if the Rwanda Government is not going to develop that plot, I am going to tell the people to go onto that plot and build houses there. <#/>Let us meet there, on the plot! <#/>I am saying this because we have been misled. <#/>Five years ago, the land was 
t
aken away from the people who were crying and saying that no adjudication had been done and now, nothing is happening! <#/>I am going to tell the people to go onto that plot. <#/>You will call it incitement, but I will tell the people to do that, because 
w
e cannot tolerate such a thing. <#/>I know that some people are going to divide that land among themselves, because it was allocated to the Rwanda Government just as a cover-up; but there is nothing like Rwanda Government. <#/>Even if the land was allocat
ed to the Rwanda Government, why could the people from whom it was taken not be compensated?
\par <#/>Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are experiencing problems of investment because of the corruption in the Government, in this and the last Government. <#/>The people
 in the Government have corrupted this country: <#/>they have perpetrated corruption so much that 80 per cent of the people in this country are the poorest. <#/>Furthermore, 30 per cent of those people are below the poverty line and all this has been brou

r. Speaker, Sir, one might wonder why I have put this Motion before the House and why I am discussing it. <#/>I am not professionally a teacher, but I went to school, I was taught and after leaving school, I have been serving in very many school Boards of
 
Governors and I see the problems of teachers. <#/>Therefore, I feel that it is high time I talk for them because, as elected Members, one of our duties is to think of the others before we think of ourselves. <#/>We have got to do things for the people who
 cannot do them for themselves, and that is why we have the honour of being hon. Members. <#/>So, because I know teachers have these problems, I decided to bring this issue here for discussion with my colleagues, hon. Members.   
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you f
ind that, generally, teachers have only one room in a school, called "staff-room". <#/>The only teacher who has an advantage is the head-master, who has an office. <#/>Sometimes, the deputy head-teacher might have an office. <#/>Now, the ordinary teacher 
-
 and when I say "the ordinary teacher", I mean the teacher who is not the head-teacher or deputy head-teacher - has no office except a common room. <#/>It is where he has to do everything that a teacher should do such as marking and setting of examination
s
 and preparation of work. <#/>Everything is done in that room, and it is where they are supposed also to be chatting. <#/>So, if the others are not busy and you are busy, you are very, very uncomfortably working. <#/>I am very glad that when I look around
 
this House, I see a number of people who have been even teachers themselves, and even those who have qualification of the teaching profession. <#/>I am talking, not because I am a teacher and it affects me; it has never affected me. <#/>I only taught as a
n
 untrained teacher for less than five months. <#/>So, I happen not to think of myself as such. <#/>In any case, I am too old now to be a teacher anyway, but I am worried about the young ladies and gentlemen who are in the profession or who want to join th
e
 profession. <#/>Personally, when I was a student, I wanted very much to become a teacher, but I did not like the conditions of teaching. <#/>Therefore, I would like them improved for the sake of those who feel like me. <#/>They want to be teachers, but t
h
ey want also to be treated like the other human beings or the other workers. <#/>When I say "ordinary teachers", do not forget that there are teachers with three university degrees, like Dr. Onyonka. <#/>He is a teacher and the fact that he is very learne
d
 does not preclude him from being an ordinary teacher - he is a teacher! <#/>Then from there, you come to those teachers who have Masters degrees, Bachelors degrees, Diplomas and so on. <#/>Therefore, the teaching profession starts from a professor down t
o the nursery school teacher, and these people have the right to live like all the other workers. <#/>Why should a District Officer enjoy a lot of privileges just because he has a Bachelor of Arts degree?

Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was saying that teachers should not be subjected to conditions which are not conducive to the provision of standard education. <#/>They should be accorded the treatment that other employees are being accorded. <
#/>I have said that teachers in most schools have only one room to share among themselves and that they do not have facilities like the other workers have. <#/>Whether you are a policeman, once you are a police officer, you are given an office and a telep
h
one. <#/>Once you are a District Officer, you have your own office, a telephone and even a messenger. <#/>But you find a teacher who has, for example, three degrees, two degrees, one degree, a diploma or a certificate of teaching being treated below the s
t
andard of a guy who did not fair so well in Form Four examination. <#/>Just because this person goes to work in a company or in the Civil Service, he is treated better than the teacher. <#/>So, the teacher starts wondering, "What is wrong with me? Am I in
 the wrong profession? Am I in the suffering profession such that I keep on suffering, and for how long shall I suffer."
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that leads me to say that that is why a number of very good teachers, after teaching for a while, they decide to l
eave the teaching profession, because they are as qualified as others. <#/>They go and get jobs in banks, government institutions and so on, because they are very marketable. <#/>Then I ask the question: <#/>"Is he or she going to do a better job for the 
n
ation than teaching?" The answer is definitely, no. But because the conditions are so bad, you cannot blame the officer because that officer is a human being, just like the other human being who have got so many privileges as workers. <#/>The teacher is t
aken to be a person who has to sacrifice. <#/>"Why should we over-sacrifice, as teachers?", they ask. <#/>And I think they are right. <#/>Why should they over-sacrifice? If I were in their position, I would definitely look for another job!
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, 
Sir, at Independence, almost all the lady teachers decided to go and do secretarial job, which required only nine months of training, and they got better salaries and facilities. <#/>The teaching profession was left with a big problem and we had to employ
 
very many untrained teachers. <#/>Why? Because they had run away to better situations. <#/>I can even quote one of them who is an hon. Member here, the hon. Phoebe Asiyo. <#/>She went and became a senior officer in the Prisons Department, because teachers
 
are treated very lowly. <#/>In the Prisons Department, she was such a senior officer. <#/>She used the same qualifications and ability, and she proved she was worth the job. <#/>But she had to leave the class-room, like many others, because teachers are g
i
ven very low and poor treatment. <#/>They are not considered! <#/>Do you know where they can complain? They can only complain to the children they teach, because they are not in touch with the employer, as it were. <#/>This is because when you are in a sc
hool, the only people you see are the teachers and the pupils or the students. <#/>So, you can complain to nobody!
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think there is a message in trade unionism for the teachers, because teachers seem to lack that. <#/>They are trained 
in everything else except that. <#/>They are supposed to be some kind of angels. <#/>I hope that hon. Komora will get a chance to tell us something about teachers since he has experience in the field. <#/>I don't think it is fair to ask teachers to sacrif
i
ce all the time and other people do not sacrifice. <#/>The police officers do not sacrifice, neither do the district officers or others. <#/>If anything they travel by Land Rovers and other models of vehicles. <#/>The teacher is only given a piece of chal
k yet he is doing the most important job to make the nation what it is.

lephone facilities! <#/>If you are a teacher and you have a problem, whereby you would like to communicate with your spouse you cannot telephone her because you do not have telephone facilities. <#/>If you have forgotten something in your house you cannot
 
make a telephone call unless you go and beg the headmaster and if he offers you the facility he has to hear what you are saying to your husband "Darling, I left my money". <#/>Who wants to be overheard? Everybody would like to make a telephone call in pri
vacy.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am saying that every teacher should be accorded telephone facilities because it is cheaper to use telephones to relay messages than to drive out of the school compound or to catch buses because a good number of them do not have
 cars. <#/>I wonder whether they even have loan facilities to buy cars. <#/>Teachers are not well treated. <#/>There are many university lecturers who have left teaching because they live under very difficult conditions. <X_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
I have interviewed a number of 
university lecturers including professors. They are treated as if they don't matter and it is human to feel that you matter. Everybody would like to be loved and to be treated like a full human being with all the rights and privileges that other human bei
n
gs enjoy. We should not ask teachers not to make or receive telephone calls. I want them to have these facilities and I want them to have telephone exchanges like we have here in Parliament. I can make a telephone call behind the Speaker's Chair or even i
n
 any of the rooms here. I am suggesting that the schools should look the way Parliament looks. I am not saying that we put these telephones in classrooms, because even here we do not have a telephone booth in this Chamber! But right next to the Chamber th
ere is a place where you can make or receive a telephone call. I am suggesting that schools should be like that. 
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the sake of Members who have never been teachers, at least they have schools in their constituencies, and I am sugges
ting that they go and have a look at them. You will find that the teachers are being told that they are small people. Yet they are the ones who have trained the district officers. The district officers have telephones and clerks and what not. They are the
 ones who have trained the medical people, the police men and so on. They have trained even the bank officers. When they go to the banks they find that their students are better off than themselves from the way they are treated.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the te
lephone exchanges will help teachers a lot. They should even have telephone booths where they can make or receive calls from their houses like any other working person. We should not say that we have to economise only when we consider teachers. The same D
r
. Onyonka now in this House is the same Dr. Onyonka who was lecturing the other day. He has not become inferior or superior. He is the same human being and his wife is the same. His children are the same ones. You should not make the teacher to suffer and
 
the relative of the teachers to suffer too. If other peoples` children are in need of ringing their parents, teachers` children should be able to do so also. I am calling for the installation of these facilities so that teachers can have private conversat
ions.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, do you know what happens if you go to visit somebody in school? Even if you are the parent of a teacher and you go to see your son or daughter at the school, you have to speak to that teacher while standing outside. Teachers do n
ot have facilities for receiving visitors. They are treated like little children. The mother of a teacher, even that of Mr. Speaker, himself, going to see his daughter who is a teacher, a university graduate, has to talk to his daughter outside under a tr
e
e or under the blazing sun. Why? Because teachers have no private rooms to attend to their visitors. I am saying that we should build a room where teachers can attend to their visitors. They are human beings. If I go to the Speaker's office now, he will a
t
tend to me privately and nobody will hear what we are saying. We are not going to stand in the corridor. When you go to see a police officer, he will call you to his office. Medical doctors are seen in their offices. Why doesn't the teacher have that faci
l
ity? Because he is inferior? As I said, some of the teachers are very learned. I have quoted examples here of hon. Dr. Onyonka and others. Why do you make these teachers to appear very small to the extent that when you go to see them you have to stand in 
the sun?

\par 
\par }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Temporary Dep
uty Speaker, Sir, what baffles me is that although these centres are so recognised as focal points for systematic development, nothing seems to have been done to justify these particular status accorded to these particular centres. <#/>Before we continue,
 
it is perhaps wise that one takes a close look at what is meant by a municipality. <#/>A municipality implies that in that centre, there is a local authority with a high degree of self-government. <#/>In this regard, self-government applies more to econom
ic viability or well-being than political well-being.
\par <#/>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is sad to note that many of these so-called municipalities appear to me to be more of political municipalities than economic municipalities. <#/>What we need are
 economic and not political municipalities. <#/>I call them political because it would seem as if somebody simply dreamt of rewarding certain people for certain good deeds and he thought the best reward was to appoint an area such a person came from as a 
m
unicipality. <#/>To me, that way of going about so crucial a matter is a misnomer and should be avoided. <#/>I would like to see a situation in which any centre, recognized as a municipality has the necessary economic back-up. <#/>In case that does not ex
i
st, I would like to see a situation where-by the mere act of making a place a municipality, the Government should go out of its way and initiate such projects as would be able to give these centres the necessary economic back-up or the necessary economic 
strength.
\par <#/>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me take Siaya as an example. <#/>Siaya is called a municipal council but does not have the means to sustain itself. <#/>It relies almost exclusively on the Government or the Ministry of Local Government f
or everything that it has to do. <#/>The very essence of a municipality which is self-governing does not exist. <#/>What exists there is a kind of political set-up that is not backed by economic resources. <#/>I do think that in order for us to be able to
 justify the calling of any centre a municipality, the Government should establish the necessary infrastructure.
\par <#/>As I speak here, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Siaya is a municipality without adequate water supply. <#/>There is no way any industria
list is ever going to move to a place like Siaya which has no water supply. <#/>I think the Government has the resources to enable it to ensure that all local authorities have the necessary infrastructures. <#/>This is because there is need to establish i
n
dustries in various towns so as to give these local authorities a reliable source of income. <#/>It would be sad to elevate towns to municipalities and then do nothing else in terms of assisting them financially. <#/>I therefore urge, through this Motion,
 
that the necessary infrastructures should be provided in these areas. <#/>The Government should go out of its way and ensure that each municipality in this country has a reliable water supply because that will attract investors and industrialists to such 
towns.
\par <#/>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Government should also go out of its way and ensure that industries are established in local authorities. <#/>We do know for sure that the Government has the means to direct certain industries to certain pla
ces. <#/>I am reminded of sometime back when almost every industry that was being started to this country was taken to Thika. <#/>This was by way of design. <#/>I am also reminded of a similar situation that has existed elsewhere. <#/>So, I am more than c
o
nvinced that the same can be done with all these other municipalities. <#/>Deliberate efforts should be made to direct certain industries to some of these places so that these places can become the focus of development. <#/>So, I urge the Government to do
 
out of its way and see to it that there is some measure of industrialisation in very urban centre that has acquired the status of a municipality. <#/>That is one way of ensuring that local authorities do achieve a reasonable measure of financial viability
. <#/>This is because through these industries they will be able to at least generate a certain measure of income which they cannot raise now.
\par <#/>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we do feel that in order for a town to justify being called a municipality,
 it must have a reliable source of income. <#/>Many of the recently established municipalities like Siaya, Busia, Homa Bay, Tharaka Nithi, Kitui and Voi--

\par <#/>As I was saying, in order to make some of these recently created municipalities effective, I would urge for the amendment of the Local Government Act to strengthen all these municipalities. <#/>The need to 
do this arises out of the importance of making local authorities self-reliant to enable them to generate sufficient funds to be able to render the required services to the people. <#/>It is also necessary to amend the Local Government Act so that the deci
s
ion-making process can be taken back to where it belongs. <#/>We are now in a multi-party era in this country. <#/>That necessarily means that the people must participate as much as possible in the governance of their own areas. <#/>That can only be reali

cal authorities have to rely on the Minister for Local Government in order to discharge their responsibilities. <#/>This taking away of power from local authorities is, to a large extent, responsible for the corruption and inefficiency within the local au

\par <#/>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as has been observed time and again, the biggest problem facing our local authorities is corruption. <#/>What is the root cause of this corruption? That corruption comes about because the Chief Officers of t

\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kirwa: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving this opportu
nity to contribute to this very important Motion. <#/>While doing that I wish to say there are various aspects which we need to look into, as far as urban development is concerned. <#/>One of the issues which is of major concern to this nation is water tr
e
atment. <#/>Many towns, even developed ones like Kitale, and many urban centres have the problem of water treatment. <#/>Water treatment has been lacking in some towns to the extent that there is s serious outbreak of typhoid and other water-borne disease
s
 in may towns. <#/>We are urging the Ministry of Local Government to as much as possible try to facilitate water treatment plants in various towns. <#/>While considering water it is also important for this Ministry to also consider seriously situations of
 
water projects. <#/>I have in mind the water plans that we have in Trans Nzoia, the Nzoia Water Project. <#/>This project was poorly planned and for the last five years it has been suffering a lot from <?/>siltation and other components which were suppose
d to be included in the initial design.
\par <#/>It is also important for the Ministry to consider small centres such as the one in question as far as sanitation is concerned. <#/>Not many of these urban centres are planned and there are sprawling settlements ar
ound the towns. <#/>A lot of people build their houses in places without taking into account provision for sewerage system. <#/>It is important that even if a small trading area has been upgraded to the status of either an urban centre or a municipality t
h
ere ought to be a master plan from the beginning of the particular town, and no building should be set until it has been approved by the various local authorities. <#/>While that is supposed to be the position for the last five years much of the developme
n
t in some of the small trading centres has been by individuals and there has not been serious consideration of how the long-term development of the area is supposed to be. <#/>What makes the situation worse is the fact that such individuals get letters of
 approval from health inspectors and other local authorities` officers to put up a building that is going to be demolished later. <#/>That is a serious matter that we need to consider.
\par <#/>The other issue that we need to look into is that of condemned house
, more so in Nairobi. <#/>It has become a habit - and this has been an audit query for the last five years - that some officers, including Permanent Secretaries and even some hon. colleagues here, get houses condemned. <#/>In some cases houses are condemn
e
d even before a board of survey is convened. <#/>Thereafter the an occupant moves into the house, uses some little money to renovate the same house and goes ahead to draw allowance from the Government on that particular house. <#/>This is a sorry state of
 affairs that we need to discourage as much as possible.
\par <#/>We also need to look at the road network in various towns. <#/>The services charge money that has been collected since the inception of this project has never been used to the satisfaction of area
s` residents. <#/>For example, Kitale is full of potholes and the Ministry Local Government owes Kitale Municipality more than shs28 million. <#/>We do not know what the Ministry is thinking about. <#/>It ought to release the money it owes to various muni
c
ipalities to enable the municipalities to make proper utilisation of it. <#/>It may not be possible for the Government to implement this Motion immediately. <#/>But I think it can try to set up a programme that is going to channel some of the money to dev
elop areas like the ones cited by the Mover in this particular Motion.
\par <#/>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is also important to realise that for any development to take place we need a good atmosphere, peace, tranquillity and cordial CO-existence of a
ll tribes in this nation. <#/>It is disturbing that we residents of Trans Nzoia have in a bad situation because we have been under serious threats all the time. <#/>The Government ought to issue a statement in respect of various threats issued by leaders,
 
particularly Ministers. <#/>While we have no over movement and settlement of the people of this nation I am seriously concerned about the security of my constituents. <#/>Some members of various communities have farms in West Pokot, Saboti and Cherangany 
C
onstituency. <#/>Now, some of the people who have been displaced from West Pokot have moved to Cherangany to settle on their own plots. <#/>It was saddening to hear some leaders saying that if we are not flushed out some who have taken refuge in Cherangan
y
 they will claim part of Trans Nzoia District. <#/>This is a very sad state of affairs. <#/>When we say these things it is because we want peace; for the development plans we are talking about here to be implemented there must be total peace. <#/>When suc
h threats are issued by Ministers then we have no alternative but to defend our people.
\par <#/>It is not enough to be a Member of Parliament. <#/>It is important for Ministers to realise that we are Members of Parliament because we represent people; we are not
 Members of Parliament in a vacuum. <#/>The Minister ought to consider this issue and the Government ought also to take a stand on this particular issue. <#/>I am saying this because it is really saddening for my area to be under serious threat from leade
r
s who are members of the Government. <#/>The same goes for the issue of <ea/>majimbo; it is no longer important to discuss the issue of <ea/>majimbo as such. <#/>We should be told what the basic ingredients of <ea/>majimbo are. <#/><ea/>Majimbo in a cocoo
n
 does not allow us to understand what it is all about. <#/>None of us is scared of anything as long as it is well explained. <#/>But if some of the issues about it are not explained it will be dangerous for Kenya. <#/>We cannot deal with a monster we have
 
not been made to understand. <#/>Those who are preaching <ea/>majimbo should tell us what it is all about. <#/>What do they want from this <ea/>majimbo which they are talking about? What are they scared of? It has reached a stage we have to speak our mind
s
. <#/>Why are people scared of the Kikuyu? We are making the Kikuyu a very important community by being scared of them. <#/>The Kikuyu are no different from other Kenyans. <#/>If they are involved in a political issue we can deal with them politically in 
the same way we deal with other Kenyans in political issues. <#/>But when we get scared of them all the time we are making them united and look impossible in Kenya, which is not the case.
\par <#/>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am saying these things becau
se I have been keeping quiet for the last nine months and my constituents are concerned because they cannot understand why I am keeping quiet in the wake of things that are not genuine for this nation.
\par <#/>With those remarks, I beg to support.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Mutere}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 : <#/>Thank you so much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to make a contribution to this very important Motion.
\par <#/>In supporting this Motion, I would like to come to the core of the Motion itself and that is finance. <#/
>The present finance system, as far as the local authorities are concerned is very inadequate because most of the financing support has to get Ministerial approval and many times when some of the local authorities request for this approval they never get 
i
t on time. <#/>It is important that the local authorities are given a free hand to be able to go shopping even if need be internationally, for money for some of the projects that they deem fit for their own municipalities. <#/>As far as Siaya is concerned
 
which is an upcoming municipality, there is a need that apart from what one hon. Member has raised, to develop even the health facilities, the housing facilities and even the power facilities within the municipality. <#/>For the young municipalities to be
 able to do this, they need adequate finances and they can only do it if they have a free hand to be able to prioritise some of the items that they feel are important for their needs.
\par <#/>While talking on the infrastructure, I would also like you to know th
at in places like Makadara Constituency which I represent, we have a very serious problem as far as the upgrading of the slums is concerned. <#/>This is the problem that the City Council has been addressing itself to but we have not had co-operation as fa
r
 as the central Government is concerned because we need some of this land to be transferred to the people so that we can come up with the upgrading programmes. <#/>It is important for an institute like the City Council which has been in existence for year
s
 to be given a free hand to be able to upgrade some of these places. <#/>I am referring to places like Mukuru, Kaiyaba and Lungalunga. <#/>If you go there you wonder whether you are actually in Nairobi; you think that you are in a different place and yet 
this is part and parcel of the city under the sun. <#/>If you visit the area you really wonder whether you are in the city under the sun.
\par <#/>It is important that we do co-ordinate these activities, so that the <ea/>wananchi's plight is improved. <#/>After 
thirty years of Independence when you see some of the things that are still in existence you really wonder whether this Independence has really been beneficial to some of our people. <#/>We as leaders ought to work together so that we forget about parties
. <#/>Our objective should be to serve the people of this nation and not divide them along the party lines.
\par <#/>Talking about some of the problems of the upcoming municipalities, education is one of them. <#/>We do know that some of these areas do have prim
ary schools. <#/>I am also concerned about some places like my area. <#/>Some of the wards do not have secondary schools. <#/>We would like to be given an opportunity to be able to go looking for funds and be given Government land to be able to construct 
s
econdary schools. <#/>It will be an ideal situation where each would have a fully fledged educational system right from the nursery, primary and secondary level so that the students or the pupils would only leave the wards when they go to the university l
e
vel. <#/>At slightly lower level of education, this could be done at the municipal level. <#/>I would like to appeal to the Minister concerned that they should consider seriously about letting the local authorities to have a free hand in getting funds to 
finance some of these facilities.
\par <#/>Talking about <ea/>majimboism, I think it is proper for some of us to air our views on it. <#/>One wonders whether we are applying double standards within our policies because here we are going out signing treaties with
 the East African community, signing treaties with KOMESA and back home we are divided. <#/>These stands are irreconcilable. <#/>We should have a definite straightforward policy whereby some of these could be put right, but we are doing the right thing at
 
the wrong time. <#/>I do not think that this is the time we should be talking about <ea/>majimboism instead we should be talking about the unification not only of Kenya, but of the East Africa, Southern Africa and the whole continent for that matter. <#/>
The World is coming to a new international world order; it is becoming a small village.
\par <#/>Looking at Africa from the international perspective, it becomes one of the many villages. <#/>If the whole of Africa becomes a village and we are talking about divi
ding Mombasa or some other places, one wonders on what level we are thinking and how serious one is in focusing his mind in as far as development is concerned. <X_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057

 going to be small <ea/>majimbo, but they are going to be upgrading of certain facilities within the localities, various infrastructures which are contained in the Local }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 </X>

\par <#/>THAT, in view of the recent economic changes which have affected prices of basic consumer goods, services and rents, and in view of the effects of liberalization process of the economy, this House resolves that:-
\par <#/>(a) the machinery for the revision of salaries, wages and other employment benefits for all workers be set in motion with a view to having adjustments made to compensate the workers for the rise in the cost of living;

\par 
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \f5\lang2057 {\f0 <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to begin by pointing ou
t that the workers of this nation played a very vital role in the process of decolonization. <#/>It will be remembered that it was the workers and their leaders who were in the forefront in the struggle for Independence when the political leaders were eit
her in prison or were not allowed to organize anything along political lines.
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \f5\fs22\lang1024 {\f0\fs24\lang2057 
<#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, usually, the role of workers in the economy is very central. <#/>It is the workers who produce the wealth of this nation. <#/>The workers of this nation work
 very hard for long hours, and yet, I do not think they are adequately compensated for the hard work they do for this nation. <#/>It is well known that the economy has largely been in the hands of foreigners who have not taken very serious interest in the
 
plight of the workers in this country. <#/>In this era of multi-party democracy, it must be one of the basic roles of Parliament to ensure that workers are adequately compensated and provided with the necessary facilities to make their working conditions 
better than they are at the moment.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the liberalization process of the economy has very serious effect on the welfare of workers. <#/>The structural adjustment policies that have been imposed by the World Bank and the I.M.F, have not be
en clearly made known to the thousand workers of this nation and it is unfortunate that the Government has not come out clearly to say what they intend to do about the plight of workers in this country. <#/>It is believed that the Government is intending 
t
o retrench the Civil Service but we have not been told clearly what modalities are going to be put in place and what considerations are going to be made in this respect. <#/>So, we have to be extremely careful as a Parliament about these policies to ensur
e that our workers do not, as a result, suffer for no fault of their own.   
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the liberalization of the economy has set in motion a very high rate of inflation. <#/>The prices of all basic commodities like sugar, maize, meal, bread, and
 milk have soared. <#/>The house rents and transportation charges have also soared. <#/>If you look around town in the morning and afternoon, you would find that almost the entire population of this town walk to and from their places of work. <#/>This is 
because they are not able to afford the cost of transportation. <#/>They cannot afford the <ea/>Matatu and Bus fares, so they can only walk to work.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the whole principle of Independence was to improve the welfare and the living standard
s of the people. <#/>If people who, several years ago, could afford Bus fare, can no longer afford the same today, this means that the workers are worse off than they have been before and we, as a country and a Government, therefore, cannot feel very prou
d of that kind of development.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the structural adjustment programme has a very serious social and political effect on the workers. <#/>We know of cases in other countries where workers have had to take to the streets---
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kiliku: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 On a point of order Mr. Speaker, Sir. <#/>The Minister for Labour and Manpower Development has deliberately decided not to attend the proceedings of this House today.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Speaker: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Order Mr. Kiliku! <#/>I think we do have the Assistant Minister present in the House.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Anyona: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister had the courtesy of informing me earlier that he was responding to the Motion but hon. Kiliku is quite right in expressing his concern about the Minister's absence from the 
House. <#/>He should be here to hear what is being said.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we as a country and as a Government ought to be very proud of the workers. <#/>This is so because although they have suffered for along time, they have not done what workers in 
other countries have done. <#/>They have not taken to the streets to demonstrate over prices of food and so on. <#/>As we were saying last time, it would be dangerous for the Government and for us as a country, to take that goodwill on part of the workers
 
in this country for granted. <#/>I am saying this because, if the workers are pushed to the limit, then clearly, we would be faced with the kind of chaos that has taken place in other countries. <#/>Therefore, this Parliament must be very much concerned a
bout the level of salaries, wages, and services that are given to the workers in this country.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we talk about raising the salaries of the workers - and we had this argument the other day - my argument is that even raising workers s
alaries by 100 per cent, might not be good enough. <#/>What should be done, as far as we are concerned, is to ensure that the workers receive salaries that are in line with their productivity. <#/>What tends to happen is that even where companies are maki
n
g a lot of profit, the workers are underpaid. <#/>We must be concerned to ensure that small enterprises do not collapse because of wages that are not in line with their level of production. <#/>But, in majority of cases, the employers can pay higher salar
ies or give better wages and benefits to their workers. <#/>However, that does not happen simply because I think we as Government and a as Parliament, have not given our workers adequate support.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the rents of houses in this city and
 elsewhere in the country, you can hardly find a place where one small cost less than Kshs.1,000/=. <#/>What is the salary of an ordinary worker in this country? Kshs.1,500 is considered a very high salary and yet Kshs.1,000/= goes to rent and one really 
w
onder what is left to the worker for his livelihood. <#/>What we are saying is that it is not realistic to say that: <#/>"let us have 100 per cent salary increase". <#/>What we are saying is that workers must be paid in accordance with what they produce. 
<#/>The employers should not enjoy super profits when the workers are suffering.
\par <#/>Today, workers of this nation, do not enjoy any employment benefits like free medical treatment as it used to be the case in the past. <#/>If you went to the private compan
ies, you would find that they have stopped all these things so that workers are unable now to get medical services. <#/>When workers go to government hospitals, they are required to pay but they do not have the money. <#/>This country as I have said, has 
retrogressed instead of progressing in terms of the improvement of the welfare of the people.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, dealing with the question of the wage guidelines, I consider them to be a conspiracy between the Government and the employer. <#/>This is so 
because we believe in bargaining and since people should bargain on what is available I do not know what interest Government has in limiting the workers` bargaining power to get the best benefits they can get from the employer? What is even worse is that 
w
e have gone to an extent of curtailing the freedom of the worker by refusing him the right to strike. <#/>I would like to hear from the Minister for Labour and Manpower Development why they believe that wage guidelines are necessary particularly in the pr
o
cess of liberalization. <#/>How can you liberalize other aspects of economy to allow the manufactures and others to raise prices and yet you do not allow the workers to bargain for the best position that they can get from the employer? If they are not abo
l
ished then the Ministry must put a very good case otherwise it is this kind of thing that creates industrial unrest. <#/>We must make employers in this nation, be they Kenyans or foreigners, to understand that they have to contend with the workers. <#/>Th
ey cannot expect the Government to protect them against our own workers.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I was saying we would like the wage guidelines to be revised but we would, in fact like them to be totally abolished, unless there is good explanation on why t
hey should be maintained. <#/>I am made to understand that those wage guidelines are the arguments of the Treasury. <#/>I do not know the link between the Treasury and the Ministry of Labour and Manpower Development in this respect, because the Treasury h
a
s its own consideration for regulating the economy. <#/>But the Ministry of Labour and Manpower Development was set up to ensure that workers are protected and in this case, the Ministry of Labour and Manpower Development is merely used by the Treasury as
 a tool to curtail the freedom and rights of workers to bargain for the best working conditions that they can obtain.
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \f5\lang2057 {\f0 <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very surprising that there appears to be no bargaining between the unions and employers going on. <#/>There was
 a lot of agitation for increase of salaries but everything seems to have died. <#/>I would like to hear from the Government what is going on. <#/>We did hear the Ministry saying that unions should start negotiations with their employers but nothing seems
 to be happening. <#/>The workers seem to have been lost because the labour union movement is also in a mess. <#/>I will speak on it later.
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \f5\fs22\lang1024 {\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the trade unions have the freedom of association under the Constitution. <#/>It is, therefore, 
not right for the Government or anybody else to create bottlenecks in that process. <#/>Many a time, when workers are trying to negotiate with their employers and the employers become difficult for one reason or another, mainly because they enjoy the patr
o
nage of the Government which protects them, they do not listen to the workers. <#/>When the workers fail to fit in then immediately the Police are called. <#/>This is an infringement of the freedom or the Constitutional right of workers to bargain with th
e employer and if the employer does not respond to the employee's demand, then the workers have the right of withdrawal of labour.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to come to the question of the de-registration of the Kenya Union of Civil Servants (K.U.C.
S) and the University Staff Union (U.S.U). <#/>There has never really been any good reason for the de-registration of these two unions. <#/>We would like the Government, particularly now, to be in the forefront in the protection of the rights of our peopl
e. <#/>When the Government, which is the biggest employer, denies its own workers the right of representation then I do not know what is expected of the rest of the employers who may not necessarily care for the welfare of our workers.
\par <X_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Speaker, 
Sir, I think that the de-registration of the K.U.C.S and the U.S.U was a political act. I do not think that it has anything to do with what the trade union does or does not do. In fact, I strongly believe that the de-registration of these two unions was a
c
tually illegal. If you look at the Trade Unions Act, the conditions which lead to de-registration of the union would never apply in either of these cases. On the one hand the Government seems to be afraid of the fact that civil servants would exercise the
i
r right of bargaining with the Government and if necessary withdrawing their labour. Instead of going about that in a democratic way, they took the high-handed action of the banning of the union. The banning of the U.S.U was because of fears that the univ
e
rsity was adopting radical policies. After all that, we have come back to where we started. Theses unions, particularly the U.S.U, were advocating for a <-/democrating> system. Having done that, we have come back to a multi-party system, which is based on
 the democratic way of doing this. }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 </X>

rovides for the manner in which application may be made for the manufacture of traditional liquor for sale. <#/>What we are saying is that if traditional liquor was prohibited, you would not then require to apply for a licence to manufacture it for sale b
ecause that would be prohibited.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, section 15 of the Act provides for a temporary licence, whereby one can brew traditional liquor for sale under temporary circumstances. <#/>Section 25 of the Act provides for the offences that are commi
tted under the law. <#/>In that section, it is an offence for any person not being the holder of an appropriate or temporary licence to manufacture for sale, or to have in his possession for sale any traditional liquor. <#/>If you manufacture for sale, or
 you sell, or you are in possession and are intending to sell without a licence, then that is an offence and not otherwise.
\par <#/>Section 25, Sub-section 2, provides that if you advertise that you have a licence to sell and yet you do not, then that is an off
ence. <#/>Section 25, Sub-section 3, provides that if you manufacture excessive quantity, more than you need for consumption, then that also is an offence.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Section 31, Sub-section 1, states very clearly that it is only an offence if t
he person has any traditional liquor upon any premises of his in a quantity greater than might be reasonably required for consumption by himself or his family.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very clear that you do not need any licence when you manufacture or 
brew traditional liquor for consumption. <#/>However, we have very peculiar circumstances where the police go and arrest people, claiming that they were brewing and consuming traditional liquor contrary to the law. <#/>In my constituency there was a recen
t
 case where the Administration Police arrested four people and charged them under this section. <#/>I want hon. Sunkuli to pay attention to what I am saying. <#/>In court, these people were charged under Cap. <#/>125 and yet the Traditional Liquor Licensi
ng Act is Section 122. <#/>The particular case I am refereeing(sic) to is criminal case No.785 of 1993 at Nyamira District Magistrate's Court. <#/>That tells you how absurd the law is.

, and I would have supported it. <#/>However, it has drafting faults and that is why I reserve my support.

\par }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>The drafting faults have been indicated by 
the <?/>Seconder of the Motion, in that the Motion is requesting for the amendment of the Traditional Liquor Licensing Act, Cap.122 and part (b) of the Motion is superfluous in that it is requesting that the Traditional Liquor Licensing Act be amended to 
allow small-scale brewers as well as home brewing. <#/>As you have heard from the <??>Seconder of the Motion, these two are provided for in the existing Act and that is why I say that the two are superfluous.
\par <#/>In fact I had the opportunity of pointing ou
t to the hon. Mover of the Motion that there will be difficulties in supporting the Motion, particularly by Members on this side of the House, who really want the brewing of traditional liquor to be uniform. <#/>We know that there are some parts of the co
untry where it is allowed and not others. <#/>I was definitely going to support it if it did not have part (b) in it.
\par <#/>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would have thought, and I am not allowed to amend it, that the Motion would have stopped at part (
a) with a small addition at the end, after removing the word 'and', of the words 'in selected areas'. <#/>It should have read "to lift the ban on traditional liquor brewing in selected areas".
\par <#/>Why am I saying in selected areas? All of us know how the b
an came to be imposed on this traditional liquor. <#/>Some of us also who have worked in various parts of Kenya know how the ban came about. <#/>When traditional brew had not been banned, we used to see people in some communities who used to sell their ca
ttle and <ea/>shambas to get money to buy traditional liquor. <#/>We know that that was one of the causes why the ban on traditional liquor was enforced. <#/>In some areas the ban should not have been enforced.
\par <#/>The Mover might ask why I said that part "
b" of the Motion is unnecessary. <#/>If we look into the existing Act, Schedule 1, you will find that if one wants to get a licence to brewing traditional liquor, one is required to fill in Form PL3. <#/>If one wants to brew liquor on a small scale, one i
s also required to fill in Form PL5, Schedule 1. <#/>I do not know what the reaction of the Government is going to be, but I had reasons for supporting the Motion if it did not have faults in drafting.
\par <#/>I was educated with money raised from traditional l
iquor brewed by my mother. <#/>My elder brother and I would not have been able to get education if my mother had not brewed traditional liquor for commercial purposes. <#/>If it was not there, today I would not have been standing in this House.
\par <#/>I know 
that in Nairobi, people brew this local liquor. <#/>If you go to Kibera and Kariobangi on Saturdays, you will find people drinking this traditional brew. <#/>Why then can people in Bunyala not drink it? I know for certain that in parts of Machakos this tr
a
ditional liquor has been officially allowed. <#/>So, I am pleading that people in Bunyala be allowed to brew this liquor. <#/>That is why I think a reasonable hon. Member from the Opposition should have amended the Motion to read "in selected areas" just 
as Nairobi and Machakos are selected areas.
\par <#/>My constituents are fishermen and fishing is just the same as mining gold. <#/>The miner goes underground very unsure of whether he will come back alive or dead. <#/>So, when a fisherman goes to fish he does n
ot know whether he will come out alive or dead. <#/>When he comes out, he is very tired from fishing---

 Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me a chance to contribute to this important Motion. I want to start off by saying that liquor and man are inseparable. The banning of local brews was
 a negative development in this country. It was negative because by so doing, we have ended up with a situation where the majority of our people have been pushed into the corner so that they are forced to go in for such drinks as <ea/>chang'aa, which to m
e
 are more dangerous than the traditional liquors which they have been used to. The result has been that people have resorted to taking a great deal more of the more dangerous liquors like <ea/>chang'aa and the like to detriment of not just their health, b
ut even the very subsistence economy from which our people derive their livelihood.
\par <#/>I am saying this because they resort to more and more drinking of <ea/>chang'aa and the rest of it. The ability to work and deliver the goods in terms of work output is 
considerably undermined. In this way, their ability to contribute to the national wealth is overly compromised. So, I do think that the time has come for us to revisit this issue, and I would agree with the Mover that we do need to unban the brewing of lo
cal liquors because this also has another positive side.
\par <#/>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the banning of the traditional liquors also seems to have landed us in a situation where the production of some very vital crops, such as millet, has had to be s
ubstantially reduced because many people produce this very vital crop mainly for the brewing of <ea/>busaa and so on. Now, with the banning of <ea/>busaa and other traditional liquors, a lot of people no longer see the need to plant millet, sorghum and so
 
on, all of which are very important, especially at a time of famine, because they are more sustaining than the lighter crops like maize. A lot of people have lost interest in growing these crops with the result that we are poorer as a country. So, I do th
ink that there is a case for unbanning of the brewing of traditional liquor. }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 </X>

I think it is also important that we should look at the traditional liquor as a vital source of income not just for the many poor in the rural areas but also for the local authorities. <#/>It is an undisputable fact that while the 
brewing of these liquors existed, a lot of local authorities at least earned a sizeable income from what we called the "brewing houses", through the sale of traditional liquors. <#/>This is because there were licences and other fees derived from the brewi
n
g of <ea/>busaa and other such liquors. <#/>More importantly, let us not lose sight of the fact that in many places, local people do not have commodities in which to trade and these local liquors have been the main source of income for many of our poor pa
r
ents and relatives at home. <#/>It is also a known fact that if it were not for this traditional liquor, many of us might not have been able to go to school. <#/>Many of our poor parents have had to rely entirely on the brewing of <ea/>busaa and other liq
uors to be able to send their children to school. <#/>The banning of these liquors has overly undermined the ability of many of our people to educate their children.
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \f5\fs22\lang1024 {\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>It is a known fact that in places like the district where I come from, we do not have a
ny cash crops to rely on for such important requirements as school fees. <#/>Indeed, it is these traditional liquors that have enabled many of our people do some little business and be able to get some income in order to meet requirements such as school f
ees and so on. <#/>So, I do think there is a case for the whole issue to be reconsidered and the brewing of <ea/>busaa allowed as one of the businesses to be carried out.
\par <#/>Right now, you will find that even other businesses such as fish mongering, which 
used to do well does not do well. <#/>This is because our rural women who play a major role by securing food for the family are unable to do that. <#/>Since they cannot now generate income from traditional liquor, they are unable to <-/sucure> vital foods
tuffs like fish, which provide the necessary vitamins.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think if the amendment being asked for is put in place, we may be able to revive this particular business and, in the process, promote other businesses which are allied to these liquors.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is also important to unban these brews for another reason, namely that it is a known fact that in the neighbouring countries, notably Tanzania and Uganda, they have what has come to be known as their national spirits. <#/>
These are the Konyaki in the case of Tanzania and Waragi in the case of Uganda. <#/>I think <-_these><+_this> is already proving to be a reliable source of income for these countries. <#/>I am sure if Kenya were to go ahead and allow the brewing of <ea/>b
u
saa and the rest of <-/>of it, which is a more reliable source of income than some of those spirits, Kenya could as well be able to come out with its own spirit that would be quite a reliable source of revenue for this country. <#/>If we are going to dive
r
sify our sources of revenue, and I would advocate that this is going to be another reliable source of revenue for this country, then, for goodness' sake we should go all out and produce it by getting the necessary mechanism in place, so that we will be ab
le to build a reliable industry based on this particular source.
\par <#/>With those few remarks, I beg to support.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  (Mr. Sunkuli): <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to this Motion on behalf of the Government.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to begin by saying that this Motion is based on the wrong premises. <#/>As you will realise, that part (b) of the Motion says:-
\par <#/>"to amend the Traditional Liquor Licensing Act to allow small-scale breweries as well as home brewing for domestic consumption."
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the brewing, sale and consumption of traditional liquor is governed by Cap.122. <#/>The reason why I say this Motion is based on the wrong premises is that Section 8 of Cap.122 provides for
 the licensing of small-scale breweries and indeed for large-scale breweries. <#/>The second Schedule of the same Act explains this further. <#/>So, if today we amend this Traditional Liquor Licensing Act, it will, in fact, have a negative effect. <#/>Thi
s is because already the law of this country allows the licensing of small-scale breweries. <#/>So, for that primary reason, this Motion should be rejected because it is based on the wrong premise.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is also a second reason why this Motion is based on the wrong premise. <#/>You also realise that part (a) of the Motion says:-
\par <#/>"to lift the ban on traditional liquor brewing--"
\par <#/>This ban is non-existent; there has never been any ban on the traditional liquor brewing and licensing.

On a point of order, Speaker, Sir. <#/>Is the Assistant Minister in order to mislead the House by saying that there is no such ban when we know that His Excellency the President, immediately after taking over the reigns of power, ban
ned all these things? Is he in order to mislead the House? You cannot even brew liquor for circumcision. <#/>You know when you want to circumcise your children you have to brew some beer for the old men, but we cannot do that now because of that ban. <#/>

in the position. <#/>What happened is that there has been a suspension on the licensing of brewing of traditional liquor. <#/>This was from February, 1979, when the Government received several complaints from members of public that the brewing, sale and c
o
nsumption of traditional liquor was not being done in accordance with hygienic conditions. <#/>The places where the local liquors were brewed and the items used were <-/unhygienic>. <#/>All these were seen as health hazards to the consumers and other resi
dents.
\par <#/>Other complaints that were received from the public also indicated that people neglected their families. <#/>In fact, I have been a personal witness of families that have diminished because of the consumption of traditional liquor and---
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mrs. Ndetei: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. <#/>Is the Assistant Minister in order to say that families are diminishing because of the consumption of traditional liquor when we know that there are also families diminishing because of the consumptio
n of whisky and even beer from the Breweries?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  (Mr. Sunkuli): <#/>I am quite in order, Mr Speaker, Sir, because today we are discussing about traditional liquor. <#/>I am saying that I am a personal witnes
s of families which started having matrimonial problems because family members could not control themselves because of this liquor which was readily available and they could not raise money to pay school fees for their children. <#/>These are complaints w
hich the Government received. <#/>There were some shocking cases of people who neglected their families and their matrimonial responsibilities because they were always out on drinking sprees.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mrs. Ndetei: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. <#/>I
s the Assistant Minister aware that there is a drink now which is being sold in Central Province and in Embu called Cantata which is killing those who consume it within six months after taking it? Is he aware that the brewing of this drink is being licens
ed by chiefs in those areas? The chief issues licenses immediately after they are applied for but they cannot license the brewing of other liquors.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Speaker: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Order! <#/>Hon. Ndetei, you know you have filed a Question on that. <#/>Because you have
 failed a Question, you are probably anticipating the reply you will get. <#/>I think it is out of order for you, Mrs. Ndetei, to do that. <#/>I urge the Assistant Minister not to respond at this time but to prepare to properly respond to the Question fil

\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Shikuku: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. <#/>My point of order is in connection with the repe
ated allegation by the Assistant Minister to effect that consumption of traditional liquor leads to breakage in marriages when we know that consumption of whisky and beer causes the same problems. <#/>Can he prove that once you take traditional liquor the
n your marriage just disintegrates?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 (Mr. Sunkuli): <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, traditional liquor has two qualities that make it one of the highest contributors to matrimonial and domestic problems that we have.
 <#/>In the first place there is no longer anything traditional about the consumption of traditional liquor.

k you very much. <#/>When I was younger than I am today, under our Maasai customs, you had to wait until you were a mature man with a stable family before you were allowed to drink. <#/>But you will find that nowadays, there is nothing traditional about t
h
e consumption of traditional liquor; it is being consumed by juveniles and by people who cannot in fact sustain the drinking of alcohol. <#/>This liquor is no longer being consumed traditionally. <#/>Secondly, traditional liquor is so readily available an
d so cheap that we are, in fact, ending up intoxicating our people by making it very readily available to them. <#/>Indeed, there is no amount of amendments that can make this Motion useful.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Raila: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. <#/>I di
d not want to interrupt the Assistant Minister. <#/>But is he in order to mislead the House that traditional liquor, which has got a very low alcohol content, is much more addictive or intoxicating than the spirits and wines that have got a higher alcohol
 content?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Speaker: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Order! <#/>Those are points of argument, and I think the Assistant Minister should be allowed to put his points across and then the other hon. Members will get a chance to demolish them.

\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 (Mr. Sunkuli): <#/>What I also know Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that if you want to make <ea/>busaa to be very intoxicating you can still do it by raising the alcohol content. <#/>It is not a question of the alcohol content but the amount that is con
sumed. <#/>The amount consumed has also the ability of raising the alcohol content.

\par <#/>My Ministry has not failed to issue title deeds to tenants of Mikindani and Chaani Site and Service Scheme because such a request has not been received by the Ministry from the Municipal Council of Mombasa which is administering the two schemes.

\par <#/>The title deeds will be issued when a formal request to that effect is submitted to my Ministry by the Municipal Council of Mombasa.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kiliku: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I asked this same Question last year and t

\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Mbela: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member is quite right. <#/>I made that promise last year. <#/>I indeed contacted the Mombasa Municipal Council and asked them whether they needed assistanc
e from the Ministry by way of surveying and sub-division of the plots and they told us that they did not need our assistance. <#/>Since that time they have not made any request for title deeds to be made available to them for onward transmission to the te

Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Mombasa Municipal Council advertised the tender and Messrs. <#/>Kasi and Surveyors won the tender at KShs. 3.6 million. <#/>But one of the officials of the Municipal Council demanded a kick-back of KShs. 500,
000/- from that amount. <#/>The Surveyor refused to carry out the work of surveying. <#/>Could the Minister direct the Surveyor to continue with the work for that amount of KShs. 3.6 million without paying kick-backs to anybody?

 the Minister for Local Government.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kiliku: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
I have evidence because I have a letter here which awarded the job to Messrs. <#/>Kasi and Surveyors at KShs. 3.6 million but he said that he could not continue with the job because he was told by one 
of the local councillors to pay KShs. 500,000.00 out of that money. <#/>He said that if he did that he would not get anything out of the job. <#/>That is why he could not continue with the job. <#/>I do not have the letter with me here now. <#/>But could 
the Minister direct that the work should continue?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Mbela: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker Sir, I said that I am not competent to direct the Municipal Council of Mombasa since they come under the Minister for Local Government. <#/>As far as the other details are con
cerned, I would suggest that the questioner makes that information available to the Minister for Local Government because even if he gave it to me I would not know how to interpret the `kick-back' that he is talking about.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Aden: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker Sir

these areas are more used to the bandits than to the security personnel and know that it is a total mistake for a resident to report the whereabouts of bandits because the moment you do that they will come back and kill you. <#/>Could the Minister, theref

istry of Local Government that whenever highly placed people want plots go around hunting for them and when they find areas where poor people are settled -- And we saw this happening at Muoroto in Nairobi here. <#/>Can we be told clearly here whether ther
e are some landless people in that area and how many they are and where he expects to settle them? How many of them have plots elsewhere and are refusing to leave that place?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Wagura: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, that particular scheme was started between 1
979 and 1980. <#/>At the time there were quite a number of applicants, out of whom 400 qualified for allocation of plots. <#/>The argument now is that some of the allottees have decided to leave their plots to go and squat elsewhere. <#/>That is why we ar

 saying that the land there belongs to the council and the council has not yet decided to allocate plots. <#/>When the time comes, some of the genuine squatters will be settled. <#/>That is why we are saying that instead of the 14 days' quit notice given 
earlier, we are now giving them 30 days to quit.

\par 
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Wambua}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  asked the Vice-President and Minister for Finance whether in view of the fact that our annua
l budget is approved by this House every year, he could explain the reasons that necessitate upward price adjustments of essential commodities like sugar, flour and cooking oil after the approval of the annual estimates.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>The Assistant Minister, Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  (Mr. Kariuki): <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.
\par <#/>It is true that this House approves the annual budget every year. <#/>It should, however, be appreciated that, although annual budget may result in incre
ase or decrease of prices due to fiscal measures taken, price changes are not the scope nor the purpose of the annual budgets. <#/>Indeed, the annual budget may not contain any price changes at all. <#/>There are various factors that affect prices which s
ingly or in combination, lead to revision of prices after the annual budget. <#/>The factors which have at one time or another contributed to the revision of price increases for sugar, flour and cooking oil are:-
\par <#/>(i) Increase in the cost of raw materials, including producer prices, (ii) price increase on inputs utilised in manufacture of the products, (iii) strengthening of major currencies against the Kenya shilling or (iv) increase in financing charges.

\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the information of the 
hon. Member and the House, when we talk about the budget, we are talking about a Government statement regarding Government's proposals to collect revenue and how it proposes to spend that revenue. <#/>Any increase in prices of certain commodities during t
h
e budget is a fiscal measure. <#/>In other words, here Government is trying to raise revenue and this must be differentiated with other increases in prices that come after the budget and which, as I said, may come about due to increased in the cost of raw
 
materials and so on. <#/>When the <-_price><+_prices> of raw materials increase, this has nothing to do with Government revenue or Government expenditure and hence has nothing to do with the budget. <#/>If we increase, say the price of beer during the bud
g
et, that is a fiscal measure because it is a way of raising revenue for the Government. <#/>However, when we increase the price of sugar, flour and so on due to the producer cost of sugar cane having gone up, this has nothing to do with the budget. <#/>I 
think the hon. Members should be able to differentiate these two aspects.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Wambua: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for the answer he has given, would he not agree with me that not all the people in the country are educated
 to know what he has been saying. <#/>All I know is that when <ea/>wananchi hear of the budget, they take it to be the final authority for increasing the prices of commodities. <#/>For example, last year when the budget was read, it took only two days for
 
the Government to announce an increase in the price of Kimbo, maize flour, and sugar. <#/>As a result of this, <ea/>wananchi then started wondering what was the purpose of reading the budget in the first place. <#/>Could the Assistant Minister tell us wha
t arrangements his Ministry has to educate our people to come out of their present mentality that once the budget is read, that is final and that prices of essential commodities should not be increased after a few days.   
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kariuki: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, 
Sir, I would not like to mislead the hon. Members or the public. <#/>Telling members of the public that there is not going to be price increases after the budget, would be misleading them. <#/>If after the budget we are told to increase the producer price
s
 of sugar or flour because the price of fuel has gone up, then how can we tell the people that we are not going to increase the prices after the budget. <#/>I think hon. Members would agree with me that they have the responsibility of educating members of
 
public not to term the increase of prices of essential commodities after the budget as mini budgets because that is a very misleading term. <#/>When Members of Parliament describe these increases as mini budgets, they give members of the public the impres
s
ion that the Government is revising its budget which is not the case. <#/>We are living in a pragmatic world where there will be continuous increases of fuel, where the Kenyan currency will continue to fluctuate against other major currencies; where inter
est rates will keep on going higher and higher and therefore, we cannot as a responsible Government assure the public that there will be no price increases after the budget. <#/>It would not be realistic to say that.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Wambua: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, wo
uld the Assistant Minister not agree with me that they have enough time to carry out thorough research before they present the budget here. <#/>Why can they not consult the people concerned so that at least when the budget is read, it can take a month or 
so before these increases or mini budget come about.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kariuki: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, anybody with the knowledge of the existing events in the world today would know how impossible it would be to predict anything. <#/>I think what the hon. Member is t
rying to ask us to do is impossible. <#/>How do you foretell that there is not going to be an increase in the fuel prices from the Middle East; how are you going to foretell that the Kenya shilling is not going to fluctuate downwards from what is it now? 
W
e do not have in Treasury soothsayers who can assist us in foretelling world events before they can happen. <#/>It is for this reason that we could not foretell that there was going to be war in the Middle East. <#/>How do we foretell that there is not go
ing to be some political problem somewhere in the world which would cause fluctuation of price or in the interest rates and so on? The hon. Member is asking us in Treasury to act as God which, of necessity, we cannot.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kiilu: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Is the Assistant Min
ister aware that the public is not interested in what he saying? Why does the Government increase prices of commodities soon after the Budget is read? The public knows that it is only when the Budget is read that prices are announced officially.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kariuki: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
It behoves on all of us in this august House to do what we can to educate the members of the public. <#/>This is why I have given a detailed answer so that the hon. Members who are here can assist in explaining to the members of the public as to
 why it becomes necessary to increase prices of goods from time to time.
\par <#/>For example, Sir, ----
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Speaker: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Order! <#/>You have to cut short this long exposition, Mr. Kariuki. <#/>Come to the point and proceed.

, Sir, I was just trying to explain because I have been told to explain why these things happen. <#/>I have just said that it behoves on all of us to educate the members of the public with regard to the fact that I have already mentioned and which I am no
t going to repeat.   
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Anaswa: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
Now that the Assistant Minister is aware that there must be price increases from time to time, is it not possible within the budgetary system to set aside some amount of money which could be used to offset some of these fluctuations?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kariuki: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
This is forcing me to repeat myself once again. <#/>During Budget time, we talk about Government revenue and expenditure. <#/>These other increases may be necessary because the providers of raw materials require more
 money to provide these materials. <#/>The two do not tie up. <#/>How can we provide for these during the Budget? We cannot.

\par <#/>Mr. Wambua asked the Minister for Energy:-
\par <#/>(a) whether he is aware that over 1000 people in Masii area of Mwala Constituency paid a deposit of shs 500/- each for the rural electrification project in 1986; and
\par <#/>(b) what has delayed the <-/completionof> this project and when it will be completed.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>The Minister for Energy}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  (Mr. Kyalo): <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.
\par <#/>(a) I am not aware that over 1000 people in Masii area of Mwala Constituency paid a deposit of shs 500/- each in 1986.
\par <#/>(b) I am therefore now aware of any delayed project dating back to 1986 in Mwala Constituency.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Wambua}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 : <#/>Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform the Minister that this Question came up in June, 1991 and <-_the><+_what> I was given was that ways and means were 
being worked out so that electricity could be installed in that place. <#/>The people in that paid the money in 1986, which is about seven years now and they still keeping their receipts, waiting for the service to be provided. <#/>I am surprised to hear 
the Minister say he is not aware of this case when the money has been in his office for six good years. <#/>Either the service is provided or the people are given back their money with interest.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kyalo: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform the hon. Member that people have a right to make private arrangements so that electricity is provided for them.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Wambua: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. <#/>I think the Minister is misleading the House. <#/>Money was paid to the Ministry an
d people were not supposed to make private arrangements for the provision in <-/thier> area. <#/>If that was the case, why were they told to pay the money to the Ministry?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kyalo: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to make one thing clear that there
 are areas that are designated "rural electrification areas". <#/>By 1986 Masii had not yet been designated a "rural electrification area, which meant that money was set aside by the Ministry to electrify the place. <#/>But people - and this happened in q
uite a number of places in Machakos District - contributed money and deposited it with the Kenya Power and Lighting Company [KPLC], which is quite normal.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Malebe: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. <#/>The Minister says that it is normal to 
deposit money with the KPLC for the rural electrification project. <#/>Is he in order to say that this money was paid to the company? I know that you deposit money with the KPLC when a service line from the main line to your house. <#/>Is he saying you de
posit money with the company even if you have no service line from the main line to your house?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kyalo: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, although that sounds like a different question all together let me inform the hon. Member that no money was deposited with t
he KPLC for rural electrification. <#/>But Masii people, and practically in most parts of Machakos District, paid money but by then the areas had not been designated for rural electrification.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kubo: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is clear that money was 
deposited; this money may not have come under the rural electrification project: <#/>it may have come under the normal commercial supplies. <#/>So, can the Minister tell us whether the money came under the rural electrification project or the normal comme
rcial electrification programme and how soon those who paid the money will get electricity?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kyalo: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, if some <-_fo><+_of> these people are within 600 metres of transformers they may apply for rural electrification which is going 
on in Masii and Mwala Locations and there will be no problem with giving them electricity.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Wambua: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think these paid the in the belief that they would be supplied with electricity. <#/>The area was surveyed about two years ag
o, and I am surprised that the Minister does not seem to be aware of this. <X_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>What is the Minister doing to ensure that these people, who paid their money, are supplied with electricity?
\par }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kyalo:}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have told the hon. Member tha
t those are within 600 metres of transformers can apply for electricity. Now, since those who paid money are <-/scaterred> and some are five miles aware from the main line there is nothing we can do until we get money to take electricity to those areas.

\par }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. P.G. Godana:}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the beginning the Minister said he is not aware that these people had shs 500/ each as a deposit, but now he has turned round and said that he aware that people paid shs 500/- to the KPLC. He is further said the ar
ea had not been designated for a rural electrification programme and now he is saying those who are within 600 metres of the transformers will be supplied with electricity. Could he stop misleading the House by contradicting himself and give a proper expl
anation as to what the position really is?
\par }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kyalo:}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no <-/contraidction> whatsoever. In 1986 the area had not been designated for rural electrification, but people paid money to get electricity privately - this is something 
which happens everyday. So, I am saying now they can apply for electricity because about three years ago arrangements were made to designate that area for rural electrification.
\par }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Wambua:}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was no secret in that issue. These peo
ple paid Sh. 500/= and receipts issued form the Minister's office. They expected to get electricity not this year, but three years ago and I think the Minister should tell the House when his Ministry is going to start giving electricity to these people or
 paying them the interest accrued on the Sh. 500/= that they paid as they await for electricity to be supplied to them.
\par }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kyalo:}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said that there is no way in which we can supply electricity four or five miles away from the mai
n line because this is too expensive. It is unfortunate that the hon. Member would like this money to be refunded to those concerned, in which case, it can be refunded any time they want.
\par }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Malebe:}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Minister 
accepts that he can refund this money. The people living within 600 metres of the main line can apply for and get electricity, but those who live beyond this distance, in spite of having paid money to be supplied with electricity, cannot get it. Could he 
authorise the company that is keeping the money that was paid to those who paid it since they will never get electricity?
\par }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kyalo:}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  Mr. Speaker, Sir, if it is the wish of the hon. Member for Mwala that this money be refunded, we are ready to do that.}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 </X>

u will find that that is another tax which is also hitting wage earners very hard. <#/>Income tax is the same. <#/>If you look at the services charge it is the same. <#/>We tried to remove services charge this morning and although we lost but I am sure th
e point was made. <#/>Those who made us lose are being waited for outside there. <#/>The people know what they did this morning. <#/>They know themselves. <#/>They are the Front-benchers.

Standing Orders and acquaint yourselves with the relevant parts. <#/>There is a section which does not allow hon. Members to discuss a matter that has already been disposed of or to anticipate a matter which is coming in the form of a Bill or a Motion. <#
/>Hon. Mungai is going back to discuss something that has been discussed. <#/>You are not allowed to do that by Standing Orders.

\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. J.N. Mungai: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 I know about the particular Standing Order. <#/>It is Standing Order No. 69.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am talking about a tax called service charge tax that is not giving a good environment to the investors in the country. <#/>I emphasise that we shall need to scrap off this tax because investors are paying heavily and 
yet no services rendered. <#/>It is the same with other taxes. <#/>We make somebody invest and then tax him so heavily. <#/>We make somebody invest in the country and do not allow him to repatriate some of his profits. <#/>If we want to employ our people 
and then we want more money into our coffers, then we shall never make it.

\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Speaker: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
I think so long as hon. Njenga Mungai does not refer to the Motion discussed this morning, he is in order. <#/>We are discussing about this Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1992 on Development and Employment in Kenya. <#/>You say there are certain obstacles
 and you also talk about tax in general. <#/>As long as you confine yourself to various types of taxes without referring to what was discussed in the morning, then you are in order. <#/>So be careful how you go about it.

\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. J.N. Mungai: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.
 <#/>I am only appealing to the Minister that in trying to encourage investors to come and invest here, it is also important that we should take care. <#/>We should take all precautions and one of them is taxation. <#/>I am sure it is clear to everybody t
hat we tend to overtax investors in our country. <#/>We are just about the highest in the world in taxation. <#/>That is why I said instead of people coming to invest here they prefer going to other countries with lower taxes.   
\par <#/>Taxation is not just a 
question of how much the Government can make to the coffers. <#/>It is also important to note that the biggest responsibility of our Government is the welfare of our people that must be well-taken care of. <#/>If we do not do that, then it is better to av
o
id such taxation. <#/>Taxation today on Value Added Tax (V.A.T.) is very high and there is no reason for that when we have so many unemployed people. <#/>We must not sacrifice the employment of our people at the expense of taxation. <#/>This is why I call
 upon the Minister for Planning and National Development to seriously look into the taxation policy.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also have another problem arising out of "letters of no objection". <#/>When our good friends who fly flags want to do a favour to 
somebody, they give letters of no objection so that person can import certain commodities free of duty and yet those commodities are also locally manufactured here. <#/>Now, that is "killing" the local industries. <#/>The technology we have here is not eq
u
al to that from overseas which is very advanced. <#/>Their total production is low but ours is high. <#/>We have imported technology from them and probably they have given us a second-hand material of technology. <#/>Therefore, we must make sure that befo
r
e any letter of no objection is issued to an importer, a thorough investigation is carried out in our industries to establish whether such commodities are also manufactured locally. <#/>Such letters must be stopped forthwith for locally manufactured goods
. <#/>We can allow importation but not for locally manufactured goods. <#/>This is tantamount to "killing" our local investors.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>The Minister for Industry}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  (Mr. ole Kaparo): <#/>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. <#/>I would like hon. Njenga Mungai to
 cite an instance where a licence had been given to import goods that are locally manufactured here because it is not good to blame the Government?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. J.N. Mungai: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very unfortunate since I do not have a document, but if the
 hon. Member wishes to challenge me, I am prepared to lay the documents on the Table, say, in a week's time. <#/>He is the Minister for Industry and should know better.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>The Minister for Industry}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  (Mr. ole Kaparo): <#/>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, S
ir. <#/>It is against the Standing Orders for a person to speculate matters that are not particularly within his knowledge. <#/>Hon. Njenga Mungai has made very serious allegations here and it is upon him to prove the truth of every utterance that he make
s in the House. <#/>Therefore, since he is over-charged or overtaxed, can he either withdraw or substantiate the allegation?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. J.N. Mungai: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not going to withdraw, but given only one week, I will be able to substantiate.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>The Minister for Industry}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 (Mr. ole Kaparo): <#/>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. <#/>It is really in order for a Member of this House to make an inflammatory statement and then asks for time to substantiate?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Speaker: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Hon. Members, I think
 it is important for us to debate in this House in a cordial atmosphere so that there can be room for some sense of humour occasionally. <#/>Hon. Mungai has made a statement that, I am sure, the knowledgeable people of this country would disagree with com
p
letely. <#/>For instance, importing things by certain individuals which are locally made here in the country cannot in all aspects be considered illegal. <#/>There are professionals who would understand why this cannot be considered to be illegal. <#/>How
e
ver, Mr. Mungai is within his rights to disagree with that and I think he is entitled to his opinion. <#/>Hon. ole Kaparo as a Government Minister too has a right to challenge the correctness of what hon. Mungai is saying that the cost of production in de
v
eloped countries is lower. <#/>This may not be the case because the cost of labour here maybe much lower and that is why some multinationals like investing in Kenya. <#/>However, that is for hon. ole Kaparo to raise as a challenge to what hon. Mungai is s
aying.
\par <#/>So, hon. Members, I would like to see an atmosphere of give and take; an atmosphere of freedom of expression without anybody unnecessarily being taken into task to prove the authenticity of what he may be saying as a matter of personal opinion.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>The Assistant Minister for Manpower Development and Employment}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 (Mr. Otwani): <#/>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. <#/>Whereas I entirely agree with your ruling regarding the atmosphere of good debate in this House, I am sure you will agree with me
 that hon. Mungai has become notorious for issuing reckless statements. <#/>Therefore, I think he has to substantiate his allegation now or withdraw it for a week until he comes back to the House with full substantiation.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. J.N. Mungai: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speak
er, Sir, if hon. Members would give me the chance to come back here and substantiate my remarks after a week or so, I will be able to substantiate fully. <#/>Perhaps even some of the hon. Ministers in this House are putting on imported suits and they thin
k
 that I do not know where the documents to prove my case are. <#/>Do we not have textile industries in Kenya today? Are we supposed to import our suits? Why <-/cann't> they buy Raymond suits that are made in Kenya instead of going to England to buy suits 
f
rom there? I think the hon. Minister for Industry is wearing an imported suit. <#/>This is why I am saying that we are not here to cover corruption. <#/>We are talking about creating an environment to attract investment. <#/>It is unfortunate that the Min
i
ster is trying to challenge us. <#/>If given the chance to come back after a week to substantiate, I will prove beyond any reasonable doubt that there is corruption involved in these things and I do not think that would be encouraging investment in this c
ountry.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know that hon. ole Kaparo went to the Ministry of Industry the other day. <#/>However, I am sure he is going to correct the situation. <#/>I am in another one year, nobody will be given a letter of objection to import. <#/>I 
am saying this because I know the present Minister for Industry is an upright man and I congratulate him for this. <#/>This is why I am saying that we definitely need to think about the development of this country. <#/>We must support our beloved Presiden
t
 who has given us positions of high management so that we can speak in this House about the national management for the benefit of the people of this land. <#/>However, each time we try to open up the way that can lead us to some truth, somebody must stan
d
 up and say. <#/>"So-and-so is undermining the Government. <#/>So-and-so is doing this or that". <#/>We do not want anybody to stand in the way of truth during this era of transparency. <#/>We do not want anybody to think we are fighting each other. <#/>W
hat we are trying to do is to correct whatever wrong has been done so that things in our country can be done in an upright manner.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am also opposed strongly to Government investment in parastatals. <X_>}{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 I am saying this because Gov
ernment investment in parastatals have become a total failure. I am sure the Government intention when it was investing in these institutions was to make the people of this land benefit by creating employment opportunities for them through this kind of in
v
estment. The other intention of the Government was to ensure that the entire nation benefit by profits that it would realize out of that investment. However, if you look at the whole business, it has achieved a negative effect. I am saying this because in
stead of the parastatals benefiting the nation, they have been used by a few individuals to fill their pockets.
\par <#/>Therefore, I would appeal to the Minister concerned to ensure that there is not any more Government investment in these parastatals, and that
 there is not going to be any more state management of these parastatals. Let us encourage international investors to come and invest in these parastatals. I am saying this because this because they will do their best to manage these institutions well and
 realize a profit and at the same time provide business and employment for our people. We shall pay tax provided the tax is not exaggerated and be able to employ more people.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if this was done, we would not continue to see white elephan
ts in the form of parastatals which do not seem to benefit anybody in this country. Unless we take care of this, we are going to have a lot of problems in as far as providing employment for our people is concerned. I would appeal to the Government to give
 credit facilities to local investors who would like to invest in these parastatals. Our people should be assisted to set up their own private investment companies by getting credits from the Government.}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 </X>

\par <#/>THAT, in view of the fact that members of the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) benefit from the fund only after retirement, and considering that children of man

\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I decided to move this Motion after seeing the mismanagement that is subjected to the workers' money by a few millionaires who have been enjoying the economy of this country since Independence. <#/>It is immaterial to give somebod

\par <#/>Proceed, Mr. Kiliku.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kiliku: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
Mr. Speaker, Sir, the workers of this country who are members of the NSSF qualify, beyond any reasonable doubt, as slaves of the millionaires of this nation. <#/>This is because their money is being invested elsewhere w
ithout their knowledge and consent. <#/>They do not benefit from their assets like building. <#/>Their money is used to buy buildings and to finance very big projects without their consent. <#/>How do you describe a slave, Mr. Speaker, Sir? I think a slav
e is a person who works without pay.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope this Government will change because we are now in a multi-party democracy. <#/>Since 1967 workers have been victimised by millionaires in this country and it is high time that the Government 
changed and responded to the demands of the people. <#/>Members of the Government may be like a stone wall, but there has not been nothing harder than the former Berlin wall which has now been demolished. <#/>This is another era in which the Government mu
s
t be accountable and transparent. <#/>This is workers' money and the Minister should tell the House the financial position of the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) as of now. <#/>He must also tell the House why Shs Nine billion of the Fund is in a susp
ense account. <#/>Very few millionaires who have been managing this Fund have been loaning themselves this money through their financial institutions.
\par <#/>If this time the Government will fails to listen to the people we will tell the people to demand that 
the Government listens to them. <#/>This is because there will be no alternative but to tell the people to demand money so that the Government listens. <#/>This is a democratic Government but it not listening to very people who elected it. <#/>If the peop
l
e come up and demand to be listened to, the Government will have not choice but to listen to them. <#/>We cannot continue witnessing mismanagement of the NSSF money being perpetrated by our very brothers with whom we have trusted with positions in the Fun
d. <#/>They are taking this money into their pockets.
\par <#/>It is no use to be in this House if we cannot solve the problems of the same people who have elected us into this House. <#/>Instead of the Government implementing the people's wishes it is engaged i
n political propaganda, while at the end of the day it will be a failure. <#/>Kanu is the ruling party and it should listen to the what the people say and implement it. <#/>There is no need of being on the defensive always and also engaging in propaganda.
 
<#/>Instead of dealing with workers and farmers problems Kanu is engaging itself in endless propaganda. <#/>It is almost a year since the last general election but the Government has achieved nothing, except propaganda. <#/>We do not want a Government whi
c
h is engaging itself in propaganda instead of implementing policies aimed at promoting the welfare of the tax payers who are financing that Government. <#/>Kanu has been going round saying that it is Opposition which is calling upon international donors n
o
t to give aid to this country. <#/>This is wrong and misleading because the main condition which has been set by the IMF and World Bank for resumption of aid to the country is elimination of corruption. <#/>If the Government stops corruption in the same G
overnment we will get aid.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Labour and Manpower Development deliberately escaped from the House because this Motion was coming up for discussion and he would be held responsible for what has been happening in the NSSF w
ith workers money, which is really not Government money. <#/>This year some parents could not send their children to school because of the high school fees charges. <#/>Even the Minister for Education has added to the parents' burden by shifting the respo
n
sibility of paying board of governors workers in schools to them. <#/>I am appealing that Kanu stops spreading the gospel about who from which area is being groomed for the Vice-Presidency because this will help us. <#/>Even Kanu leaders are undermining o
n
e another. <#/>Even in the Opposition everybody wants to be this or that. <#/>Our problem is not going to State House or Presidency; our problem is the peoples's problems. <#/>Let those who are blessed by God go to State and listen to the 24 million Kenya
ns, but not engage themselves in politicking.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like the Minister to outline how the contract on the NSSF House extension complex, which is under construction, was awarded and how much money has been spent on this complex. <#/>We want the Minister to tell us ---

\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kiliku: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the Assistant Minister is taking down notes, he should mark that we want to know why when retired people go to the NSSF do not get their money. <X_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
<#/>It is good to establish a workers' children's education sch
eme to be giving loans to workers almost every year, based on the security of the deposits in the NSSF. Workers should be loaned less than the amount they have deposited there, and this will be enough for school fees. There is no need of waiting to give m
o
ney to somebody when he is dying, and when his children have been unable to go to school. After all, what the Ministry has been proposing - I support the Government in that it has not implemented the Ndegwa Commission - should be implemented so that the w
orker's money is kept as pension. I support the Government in this.
\par <#/>We want the retired members of the NSSF to be given their money at once when the time comes. If you give out this money as pension, some workers die before they have taken out all their
 money. Some workers in this country die very soon after retirement due to frustration. Those who live more than 10 years after retirement are very few. The environment under which our workers work interferes with their health, and they die soon after the
y retire. The chances are very few that they spend more than 10 years alive after retirement.
\par <#/>Unfortunately, as I am talking here now, there are also companies that are not remitting NSSF dues in time. Some companies have been placed under receivership,
 and when they wind up, they disappear with NSSF dues which they have not remitted to the Fund. Nothing has been done about such companies, and the Minister is not taking action in this respect. It due to such things as these, that we believe that some se

<#/>I have shown a lot of tolerance because a Kenyan child died abroad and I hoped that you would press for action from the Assistant Minister. <#/>You know the basic rules that you ask one question at a time. <#/>Can you ask one question at a time and th

\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Prof. Anyang\'b4 Nyong\'b4o: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will ask one question at a time. <#/>The question is this: <#/>Can the Assistant Minister explain from the point of view of the 
second post-mortem done in Nairobi, whether or not he is satisfied with the statement he got from India and whether or not, those statements do indeed explain the real circumstances under which this lady died?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Dr. Manduku: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have
 two post-mortem reports. <#/>One report was done immediately after the death of Ms. Imire and another report was done in Nairobi by a Nairobi pathologist, Dr. Aggrey Nyong\'b4
o, presumably a brother to the questioner which, however, does not matter. <#/>The 
report given by the doctors in India proved that this lady died of severe burns that she inflicted on herself or otherwise, burns of 95% extent. <#/>That is a complete burn of the whole body, because literally there was no skin left. <#/>Definitely under 
such circumstances there is nothing you can do other than have a very explicit cause of death. <#/>After the body had been brought back to Kenya a Kenyan doctor, Dr. Aggrey Nyong\'b4
o, looked at the body and raised these questions which are very, very obvious; that the real cause of death was severe burns.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Prof. Anyang\'b4 Nyong\'b4o: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not disputing the fact that the cause was by burning.   
\par <#/>But I am disputing the conclusion by the Indian doctor and the Indian police that it was suicide. <#/>This is because the dramatic }{\i\f0\fs24\lang2057 persona }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
in this case are highly suspect. <#/>The Assistant Minister is not reading to this House the questions raised by Dr. Nyong\'b4o, a Nairobi Pathologist, regarding the conclusions reached in India. <#/>What is happe
ning in India is of great concern to this nation. <#/>When somebody dies of burns, it does not }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 necessary mean that they have committed suicide; somebody else could have burnt them. <#/>In this circumstance, I concur with my brother that there i
s suspicion of murder in India which is being covered up by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation and the Indian authorities.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Dr. Manduku: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 There is nothing being covered up here, Mr. Speaker, Sir. <#/>The Indian police have done investigations and we are telling the House what the Indian Police and authorities did.

that these people who were supposed to be in the know did not make any statements to the police. <#/>He also says he is satisfied with that. <#/>Is he not contradicting an obvious thing?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Speaker: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Order, Dr. Otieno-Kopiyo! <#/>Are you putting the question to me or to the Assistant Minister?

\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Dr. Manduku: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Indian police recorded statements from several people who were around that vicinity. <#/>They recorded a statement from one Shailaja Kriparidi ---

\par <#/>The Assistant Minister for Public Works (Mrs. Mwendwa): <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.
\par <#/>The road will be graded between mid-August and the end of September this year. <#/>I think it has already been graded.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Rai: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I appreciate the concern shown by the Assistant Minister because work on parts of this road has been done. <#/>So, I want some assurance from her as
 to whether something will be done on the other part of the road, because when the rains come then the road will be impassable.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Dr. Otieno-Opiyo: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. <#/>The Assistant Minister said work on the road has been done

 Mr. Speaker, Sir, since work on this road was done on time I insist, as I always do when something is done, the hon. Member should say "Thank you". The hon. Member claims that the work is not good enough but I am sure he will appreciate that we have
 a very heavy road maintenance load. So, if we go for perfection on the roads some roads will not be done. Therefore, while I am not saying that we will do a shoddy job, I want to say that we intend to grade as many roads as possible in Kenya. Therefore, 
I think the hon. Member will agree with me that we have graded this road and that we should move on and grade other roads.

een mid-August and the end of September this year. Now, hon. Rai has conceded that the road has been graded though not satisfactorily. Since this road has never been graded since Independence it means the hon. Rai is aware that the road is still in bad sh
a
pe. The Assistant Minister cannot use a grader on such road in one day and then expect everything to be in order! So, with all due respect to the hon. lady could she confirm to the House that the grader will go back to this road and do the work satisfacto
rily?

graded. I agree with hon. Rai that perhaps the road has not been done to his satisfaction. But the fact of the matter is that a grader has been on the road and graded it. I have information that there are a few potholes on the road, but I have said that w
h
en we grade some roads it is not easy to make them perfect because of the road maintenance load which we have. We have to move on to other roads because everybody wants a grader on their road. So, the work has been done and I am sure hon. Boy has not been
 on this road.

, since 1992 about 13 raids have been carried out in this area. <#/>Despite the fact that the Assistant Minister had earlier on promised in this House that security measures would be taken and that the situation would be under control, this has still not 
h
appened. <#/>This year alone about five raids have been carried out in this area and one of the victims was a General Service Unit officer, who disappeared and up to now has not been found. <#/>Can the Assistant Minister seriously revisit his promises and
 tell the House what measures he is taking to contain the situation.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Awori}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 : <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said we have intensified the various security personnel in the area to try and contain this banditry that is a spill-over from far up north d

\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Dr. Kituyi: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Assistant Minister said that the Government is doing something, as it is doing in other areas of this country, to end this banditry. <#/>People from
 such an area should be very frightened because what the Government is doing in other clashes-affective areas in this country is negative. <#/>Can the Assistant Minister tell the house what concrete action the Government is taking to end banditry, apart f
rom general finalities and excusing internal problems on neighbouring countries even when there are problems of banditry and clashes in the area without any bordering countries?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Awori: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr Speaker, Sir, this is }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <+_a>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 democratic country and Member

n a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. <#/>Is it in order for the Assistant Minister to tell the House that the government is trying to increase the number of security forces, when we know that even if you tell the entire Kenyan armed forces to move to the
 
North Eastern Province they are simply not the right quality of manpower to bring peace in that area? We also know that the more security forces you send to that area to carry out operations, the more innocent people they kill. <#/>This has just happened 
in Wajir, where they killed people \endash  and an Assistant Minister here is a witness of this \endash  instead of following up bandits.

d escorts, from experience, I can tell him that this has never worked and it will never work. <#/>The only solution to the problem in Northern Kenya is to recruit for security work people from that area. <#/>We put that request to the Government because b
o
th the killers and the victims are people from Northern Kenya. <#/>So, the only solution will be to use security people from Northern Kenya . <#/>Would the Government kindly consider recruiting an anti-banditry squad from Northern Kenya? This is because w

\par <#/>(a) whether he is aware that the police officers in Nairobi were not paid their allowances like the other officers in provinces during the last multi-party general elections held on 29th December, 1992; and
\par <#/>(b) if the answer to (a) is in the affirmative, whether he could make immediate arrangements to release such allowances without further delay.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  (Mr. Sunkuli): <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.
\par <#/>(a) Yes, I am aware.
\par <#/>(b) I wish to inform the hon. Member that the Accounting Officer has been requested to make arrangements for the payment.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kamuyu: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am grateful for the answer the Assistant Minister has given. <#/>However, he must know that the police in this country, particularly in Nairobi, are also human beings and one is surprised to note the way they have been let down
. <#/>They work under bad conditions and lack basic facilities, earning very low salaries at the end of the day and this has continued to frustrate them a great deal. <#/>Could he tell the House why it has taken him 10 months to have these officers paid t
hese allowances? Furthermore, could he tell us the total amount to be paid to Nairobi police officers involved in the last general elections? Perhaps he could give a breakdown of the amounts payable by rank?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Sunkuli: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. M
ember has asked three questions all at the same time but I will endeavour to answer one at a time. <#/>Regarding the amount of money payable to officers in Nairobi, I would like to inform the hon. Member and the House that there has been a delay in the pa
y
ment. <#/>However, we have now got in touch with the Accounting Officer in charge, who is the Clerk of the National Assembly and requested that the police officers be paid Shs. 48 million. <#/>There are 11,822 security officers in Nairobi Area who worked 
during the last general elections and they will all <-_ben><+_been> paid in due course.   
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kamuyu: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. <#/>I did hear the Assistant Minister complain that I combined too many questions and I apologise for that.
 <#/>However, I wanted to know how much each officer is getting according to his rank? Can he be kind enough to give the House this information? Could he also tell us when he will release the money?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Speaker: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Kamuyu, that is not a point of order!

\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Speaker: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Order, Mr. Kamuyu! <#/>You yourself have already acknowledged the fact that you asked three questions in one go. <#/>Unless, you want to raise another supplementary questi
on, let hon. Farah ask his question. <#/>If you still want to ask another question you will probably catch my eye to do that.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Farah: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant <-_Ministers><+_Minister\rquote s> reply would he not agree with me that 
the failure to pay the police officers in Nairobi Area their dues, is the reason why they are practising a lot of corruption in Eastleigh among the Somali refugees?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Sunkuli: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Member is confusing two things: <#/
>We are not talking about payment of salaries but about payment of allowances as a result of the last general elections. <#/>I do not think that non-payment of salaries could lead to such a thing which the hon. Member is not quite right to state has actua
lly happened.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kamuyu: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell the House how much will be paid to each constable and each inspector?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Sunkuli: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, that question was not anticipated when we received the original Question. <#/>In fact, it is a totally different question altogether.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kamuyu: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker ,Sir. <#/>This question is quite relevant. <#/>So may I request, through the Chair, that the Assistant Minister be asked to answer 
the question because the people in Narobi and the nation as a whole would like to know the position regarding this question?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Sunkuli: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, if it is the wish of the House that I do the mathematics involved here for the hon. Member, 
I will do so. <#/>However, I said that Shs. 48 million would go to 11,822 security officers. <#/>The hon. Member should do the mathematics and divide this money among that number of officers.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Anyona: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we speak about the po
lice, an impression is created that we are against them. <#/>We would like to demonstrate, using this Question, that, in fact, we defend everybody's rights. <#/>This problem is not just in Nairobi. <#/>As far as I am concerned, it affects many other parts
 
of the country where the police and many other officers have not been paid their allowances. <#/>Would the Assistant Minister tell this House whether the problem is with the Electoral Commission or with the district commissioners who may have been given t
he money, but did not pay the police and the other officers involved?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Sunkuli: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have now sorted out the problem by getting in touch with the Accounting Officer who, as the hon. Member is now aware, is the Clerk of the Nationa
l Assembly. <#/>It was this consultation that caused all this delay. <#/>However, we have gone through the problem and I am glad that, for a change, the Opposition is thinking about the welfare of our policemen.

he Assistant Minister tells us that the Government is going to commit Sh. <#/>48 million to the police, does he mean to tell us that all the other civil servants who took part in the elections have been paid their allowances or are we going to have to ask
 another Question here relating to unpaid civil servants?

ow you can find a solution to the problem at hand. <#/>The Ministry has asserted that it is not true that most public telephones are defective. <#/>So, from there on, whatever else the Assistant Minister says is meaningless. <#/>It is public knowledge tha
t
 public telephones throughout the country are defective for one <-_reasons><+_reason> or another. <#/>I am not necessarily blaming the Ministry for this, but would the Assistant Minister, having said that most public telephones are not defective, carry ou
t a survey in Nairobi and other places and tell us exactly how many public telephones are defective and how many are not?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Morogo: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Question, as asked, states that most public telephones are defective, and what we are saying 
is that some are certainly defective. <#/>We are not denying that, but not most of them are defective. <#/>As I have already stated, any time there is a breakdown, we take measures to repair these telephones.
\par <#/>As to how many telephones are broken down in Nairobi, this is a question I did not anticipate. <#/>Maybe, we will look into that later.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Farah: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, my own personal experience in Liboi, 200 kilometres from Garissa and situated in my constituency, is that the telephones do no
t work for half the month and every time technicians have to be brought from Garissa to repair these telephones. <#/>This costs a lot of money. <#/>In the light of that, could the Assistant Minister have technicians posted to the places where such inciden
ts occur? It is in that particular place that there is a massive refugee population, and postal and telephone services would assist these people a lot if they were provided in the right way.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Morogo: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that there is a task 
force looking into the issue of the broken down telephones whenever such cases arise. <#/>When we are satisfied that there is such a break down, we will dispatch part of the task force to the hon. Member's area.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Farah: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 On a point of order, Mr. 
Speaker, Sir. <#/>Is it in order for the Assistant Minister to be telling us about a task force that would be brought from Garissa every time there is a telephone break down and which would consume thousands of shillings of taxpayers' money when such brea
k
 downs should cost only about KShs. 100/-? Why can we not have some technicians present in Liboi to repair telephones whenever there is a damage? We also know that the technicians claim a lot of allowances whenever this happens so that they can misuse pub
lic funds.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Morogo: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did mention that should this task force be satisfied that there is need for a technician to be stationed permanently at Liboi, we will do that.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Obure: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is i
t in order for the Assistant Minister to lie to this House and the public at large, or mislead this House, when it is well known that even the telephone booth in Parliament Buildings is broken down deliberately so that we can pay for the money that has be
en looted from the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications?

 breakdowns, but they are not deliberate. I would like to urge hon. Members of this House to request the members of the public not to vandalise some of the telephone equipment because that is what brings break downs in of the available telephone facilitie

 <#/>Yesterday, the President said that some <-_cattles><+_cattle> were slashed all over their bodies. <#/>However, can you compare cattle with people? If cattle go into your garden and you find them there, you can cut them up the way you want, but if som

ried to burn them and we had to have the normal right of defending ourselves. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to say that during the colonial times the Maasais were suppressed and isolated. Some people took the same advantage to suppress us and invade our
 
land. They took our schools and everything. Enough is enough. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is the question of incitement. Some people keep on saying that hon. Ntimama is inciting. I have been elected by my people and it is my responsibility to give them

 of the publications are controlled by one ethnic group. We tried to raise the whole question of the plight of the people \rdblquote downstream\'94, that they were dying, their
 livelihood was in danger, their cattle were dying and their economy was in jeopardy, and nothing was put down for that. And this is the trouble, the whole environment was eroded, there were no rivers, there were no dams. Mr. Deputy Speaker, how come ever
y
body else and all these publications here were supporting the right of the Kikuyu to stay there and making sure that we all die, down-stream? That is the situation that we, definitely, cannot tolerate, and if necessary, we have defend our rights and we wi
ll continue to defend them! Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to say very clearly that what happened the other day here; I am talking of the publications again, during the opening of this Parliament, the Press went saying that \rdblquote 
Kenyans are outraged\'94, when those young men who were throwing stones, they were hit. What were they expected to do? This is the same situation at Enoosupukia; we were \rdblquote provoked beyond any reasonable doubt\'94
, and our cattle were mutilated. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am tabling six picture
s here to prove that anybody can see what really happened. I am saying that we have lived with those people, but we can no longer be suppressed! We can no longer be looted! We can no longer be milked! And I am saying, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, considering 
the situation as it is, I am saying this one very clearly, if people want us t live together, they must not think that we are \rdblquote second-class citizens\'94
 in this country. We are not second-class citizens! We are citizens of this land and we are going to say tha
t our rights must be recognised. The rights of the people there must be recognised! The British suppressed us, and we cannot have the Kikuyu suppressing us again! Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am saying it openly that the fact is that if people want us to li
v
e together, we can live together; if they do not want us to live together, than that is their problem, it is not our problem. We have lived with them for hundreds of years and, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Members of the Opposition keep talking about this

\par <#/>(a) Is the Minister aware that there is a shortage of food and medical supplies in Kerugoya District Hospital?
\par <#/>(b) Will the Minister, as a matter of urgency, provide funds to procure food and medical supplies for this hospital?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>The Assistant Minister for Health}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  (Mr. Criticos): <#/>Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.
\par <#/>(a) I am aware that occasionally there is a shortage of food and m
edical supplies to Kerugoya District Hospital. <#/>This financial year the hospital has been allocated KShs. 920,000/- for purchase of patient food and the first instalment of KShs. 568,000/- has already been issued to the hospital to run it up to Decembe
r
, 1993. <#/>The balance will be released to the hospital in December. <#/>The Health Management board should see how it can reschedule payments and even how to use some of the cost-sharing funds to pay for supplies when the hospital runs short of funds on
 
certain occasions. <#/>As for the medical supplies the hospital has been receiving its share of medical supplies from the Medical Supplies Co-ordinating Unit on a regular basis whenever they are available. <#/>During this month of October the hospital rec
eived general drugs from this unit on the 9th, 15th and 22nd.
\par <#/>(b) The necessary measures have already been instituted, as I have already explained.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Mbui: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not sure that the Minister is really not aware although in the written answer he says that he is not aware. <#/>Is he really aware or not?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Criticos: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I must apologise to the hon. Member because when I received the reply this morning, I was not satisfied with it, so I went and 
did my own research on this particular Question in Kerugoya District Hospital. <#/>I have the revised answer which I asked the Ministry to deliver to the hon. Member this afternoon.

 <#/>I think the Minister is misleading this House. <#/>It is common knowledge in this country that virtually all Government hospitals have no food for patients. <#/>There is a specific case of Embu Hospital where the patients have to be fed by relatives.
 <#/>The patients have also got to use their own <-/pajamas> in the hospital. <#/>Why is the Minister misleading this House and the nation?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Criticos: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is a lot of loud consultations in the House and I am unable to hear the hon. Member's point of order. <#/>Could he repeat it please?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. P.N. <#/>Ndwiga: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said that the Assistant Minister is deliberately misleading this House because it is common knowledge in this country that most Gov
ernment hospitals in this country have no food, clothing nor drugs. <#/>I gave Embu District General Hospital as an example of a hospital where patients have to be clothed and fed by their relatives. <#/>There are neither drugs nor clothing in the Hospita

\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Criticos: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has never misled this House. <#/>A typical example is today when I was not happy with my answer so that I went to do my own 
research in Kerugoya General Hospital. <#/>We do have the problem of drugs as a nation, but the hon. Member cannot say that the Ministry of Health is misleading the House that there are no drugs at all in Kenya. <#/>We have a problem with the supply of dr
ugs. <#/>We have not been receiving drugs and this will continue up to the first week of November.

\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Mutahi: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it
 is a Government policy for the people of this country to be self-sufficient both financially and in food. <#/>The Government encourages people to work hard. <#/>Mukurweini people have really worked hard to produce several litres of milk every evening, bu

\par <#/>On 26th October, 1993 at 10.00 a.m in Machaka Village, Sirisia sub-location in Bungoma District, an nunknown number of gansters armed with automatic weapons raided the h
ome of Mr. Makwere. <#/>They shot him dead together with 10 members of his family, who included his wife, Hellen Cheboi and a few visitors. <#/>One man, Ngomuji Panpet was injured. <#/>The victims are all Sabaots who were in Mr. Makwere's house. <#/>They 
h
ad gathered there for a marriage ceremony and while they were enjoying their food, they were attacked. <#/>As soon as the incident was reported, the members of the Provincial and District Security Committees rushed to the area in order to establish the mo
t
ive of the attack and take appropriate measures. <#/>So far, the motive has not as yet been established. <#/>Intensive investigations are under way. <#/>Members of the public should know that the reports appearing in some sections of the local Press are g
rossly inaccurate, inconsistent and insensitive to details.
\par <#/>Members of one community have been incorrectly depicted as the aggressors while they are the victims of the wanton attack which has left helpless and innocent men, women and children dead. <#/>The attackers have not, so far, been identified.
\par <#/>It is very irresponsible for the Press to publish such incorrect information without confirming with the authorities on the ground. <#/>The reports may have been unwittingly meant to heighten tension bet
ween the two communities for unknown reasons by the Press representatives on the ground. <#/>The Government views these reports seriously and it demands corrective measures to be instituted immediately.
\par <#/>The Government further wishes to reassure the res
idents of the area that every effort will be made to apprehend the perpetrators of the crime. <#/>The Government has already taken measures aimed at ensuring that peace and security are maintained in the area. <#/>Nobody should take the law into his own h
ands as the Government is taking important action. <#/>The Press should also desist from publishing misleading information which would both confuse and complicate situation which is already being taken care of.
\par <#/>Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I urge that any p
erson in the country or within that area who might be owning a gun or knows someone with a gun to come forward and report this matter because the Government is seriously taking the necessary steps on this matter.

\par <#/>So Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also inform the House, that, as I am talking here there is enough security trying to c

\par 
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Nthenge: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Co-operative Development the following Question by Private Notice.
\par <#/>(a) What led to the collapse of the Machakos Union Farmers Savings Bank?
\par <#/>(b) What action has so far been taken to ensure that the officials who embezzled the money are taken to court?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>The Minister for Co-operative Development}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  (Mr. Munyi): <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.
\par <#/>(a) The Machakos Union Farmers Savings Bank closed its doors to customers in January, 1993, when it could no longer meet the depositors' demand of withdrawal because the loanees were not paying their debts as expected.
\par <#/>(b) Suspected embezzlement of money by the officials running the organization has been investigated and, in this regard, a team of audit officers has been detailed to carry out special audit covering the period going back to 1988.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this exercise is continuing with the specific objective of identifying any form of embezzlement or misma
nagement as far as the former management officials of the organisation are concerned. <#/>Once the exercise is completed, the necessary appropriate action will be taken against the identified culprits.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Nthenge: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, when somebody b
orrows money, they normally invest it in saleable property. <#/>Can the Minister tell us why, if the loanees did not repay the loan, their property were not auctioned to recover the money?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Munyi: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to tell the hon. 
Member that the Machakos Co-operative Union does not only operate in Machakos, but also in Makueni. <#/>They also have other activities. <#/>On the issue that he has just mentioned, action has been taken against those who have been accused for having embe
zzled the money belonging to the farmers. <#/>So, action has been taken.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Col. <#/>Kiluta: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I appreciate the answer that has been given by the Minister, is he aware that this money was from the farmers and was intended to pay s
chool fees for their children? What action does the Minister intend to take to ensure that, at least, these farmers are paid some substantial amounts to pay the school fees to enable their children to go back to school?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Munyi: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir,
 you can see that some of the members of our society are not really trusted. <#/>What the hon. Member has just said is exactly what the Government is doing to see that the farmers and the people in that area are uplifted. <#/>Action has been taken and I f
ully agree with the views of the hon. Member, and I would like to assure him that their views will be taken into consideration.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Gethenji: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the co-operative department is charged with a very important responsibility of looking af
ter the interests of the farmers; these are the small-scale producers of coffee, tea and other crops. <#/>I am afraid that one of the problems that the farmers face is that co-operative officers have become involved in corrupt practices. <#/>They embezzle
 
money in conjunction with senior officials of the co-operative societies. <#/>What is the Minister doing to ensure that co-operative officers are not involved in embezzlement of the money of small-scale farmers, since this practice is rampant in the count
ry?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Munyi: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Mr. Speaker, Sir, what hon. Gethenji is trying to ask is exactly what I have just answered.

\par <#/>Mr. Ndicho: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. <#/>My point of order concerns what has been reported today in the Daily Nation. <#/>It reads:
\par <#/>"The Nakuru MP, Bishop Kimani, was arrested by police yesterday because of publishing some information on 21 August..."
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you know very well that hon. Bishop Kimani asked this Question in this House on an incident where an aircraft had sprayed chemicals in this area to control quela birds. <#/>Is 
it in order for policemen to arrest Members of Parliament when they ask Questions in this House? If I know that I am going to ask a Question and the police from, for instance, Ruiru, Juja or Thika will be waiting for me along the road to arrest me because
 of that, then I will be forced to abstain from asking Questions.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under Standing Order No. 45 (i), I want to ask whether under Standing Order No. 171 (4) we can move a Motion of Adjournment to discuss this particular incident.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Speaker}{\f0\fs24\lang2057

ow, under our Standing Orders, that we do not take newspaper reports as conclusive on any matters that are reported therein. <#/>I think the House had better wait until the hon. Member himself is here, because he will be in a better position to give the e

\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to make Membe
rs of Parliament realise that the Ministry of Health is a service Ministry whose aim is to improve the health of the people so that they enjoy good health and become economically active all the year round by putting more emphasis on prevention of diseases
 and treatment of those diseases which cannot be prevented.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Ogur: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 On apoint of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. <#/>We are discussing a very important vote and for this reason, I would request that the Minister speaks loudly and very clearly for us to h

\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Speaker: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
Yes, Mr. Ogur is quite right here. <#/>I have dealt with this issue before and I have told hon. Members to try as much as possible to make themselves audible. <#/>However, it may also help the House m
uch more if hon. Members themselves would consult each other in low tones so as to allow those of us who do not have extra loud voices to be heard. <#/>As I have said in the past, I have no way in which I can regulate the volume of any hon Member on the F

\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>The Minister for Health}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 (Mr. Angatia): <#/>Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir for your ruling. <#/>If Members listened, I am sure they will hear me. <#/>I was saying that I would like all Members to appreciate that investment in health is inves
tment in the general welfare of this country and in development in general.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the main goals of this Ministry are about six and, I want to read them as they are outlined in the current Five-Year Development Plan. <#/>The first responsib
ility of this Ministry is the coverage of all cases and making sure that all people have access to hospitals.
\par <#/>The second aim is that we should put a lot of emphasis on maternal and child health and family planning services. <#/>The third aim is the con
solidation of urban-rural curative and preventive medicine or services for the whole country. <#/>Fourthly, it is my intention to strengthen the Ministry's capacity at the district level. <#/>Here, we have set up district health management boards and I wo
uld like to ask Members of Parliament to take more interest in these institutions.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fifth goal of the Ministry of Health is that it wants to increase its inter-sectoral co-ordination by asking other Ministries and sectors to join it
 in dealing with various problems such as AIDS, environmental health and other matters. <#/>And finally, according to our development plan, we want to increase alternative health financing sources. <#/>Here, we are talking about cost-sharing and I am sure
 that Members of Parliament are already aware of this.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since Independence, we have been making a lot of progress and we have made some very tremendous achievements. <#/>For example, in 1963, we had only 66 hospitals, but today ---
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Ogur: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. <#/>I respect hon. Boy, but on very many occasions, he turns his back on both sides of the House, the Kanu side and the Opposition side, and I do not know what it means. <#/>Hon. Boy should be told not t
o be doing that any more, particularly when an important Motion by the Minister for Health is on the Floor. <#/>Please, Mr. Speaker, can you ask hon. Boy to move from here and go to talk elsewhere?
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Speaker: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Order! <#/>I do appreciate the sentim
ents of the hon. Member for Nyatike. <#/>The Motion of the Ministry of Health and the health of our nation are both very important. <#/>Health is a very important aspect of our lives.
\par <#/>Yesterday I pointed out to hon. Members that if you are sitting in y
our place in accordance with the Standing Orders, then you must not be on motion from position A to position B, unless you are contributing. <#/>Otherwise, it is contrary to Standing Orders. <#/>So, I will ask the hon. Members of the House to sit in accor

You know very well that I am not a doctor, don't you? Can you hon. Minister take a position that is near a microphone or move to the front? As I have said, health situations are very important and as you can hear from the House itself, hon. Members wish t
o hear what you are saying. <#/>Please, try as much as you can to increase your volume.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>The Minister for Health}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  (Mr. Angatia): <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure that these hon. Members can hear me. <#/>It is true that I was one of the most "vocal" hon. Me
mbers of Parliament some years back, but now that what I was fighting for has been achieved, which is a good Government, I do not have to "shout" any more.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was telling hon. Members that we are operating according to our National Dev
elopment Plan, and I have read out six main policies. <#/>I have always told hon. Members that in 1978 the World Health Organization made a declaration called Alma Ata which put emphasis on health-for-all by the year 2000. <#/>This means improving health 
c
are to all people. <#/>The main aim here is to put health into two parts. <#/>The first and most important part is the prevention and promotive care. <#/>The second part, which is for treatment, will receive less emphasis than the first one. <#/>I want to
 assure hon. Members that since Independence, we have been making a lot of progress. <#/>I had informed hon. Members about the tremendous progress that has been made, and I would like to summarize it for all the hon. Members to hear.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, t
he first one, is that while in 1963 we had 52 hospitals, now we have 93 district hospitals, 8 provincial hospitals, one functioning referral hospital and another referral hospital being built at Eldoret. <#/>In 1963 we had 160 health centres, now we have 
3
91 health centres and we had 250 dispensaries, but now we have 1,134 dispensaries. <#/>In the meantime, because of our emphasis on prevention of diseases, we have had child mortality rate reduced by almost 50 per cent as of now. <#/>Our life expectancy ha
s increased from 55 years to over 60 years. <#/>These are achievements which our Government has made, and I would like to ask hon. Members to take stock of this and to be proud of these achievements.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the details of what I am saying and
 what we have been able to do so far are embodied in the effort of teaching the rural community to remove the burden of diseases such as malaria, intestinal worms, tuberculosis, measles and others. <#/>We can do this by use of preventive measures rather t
han to wait until people go to hospitals.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the second issue here is that we have decentralized medical services. <#/>The Ministry of Health and <ea/>wananchi through the spirit of <ea/>Harambee have been able to achieve what I have just
 mentioned. <#/>We are prepared to provide maternal health and family planning services. <#/>Here again, we are relying on the communities to do just that. <#/>Promotion of our own health is the responsibility of all of us. <#/>As I have said many times b
efore, I would like hon. Members to realise that this year we launched a document called World Development Report which is investing in health. <#/>There are various programmes which come under this ---
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Kiliku: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, 
Sir. <#/>The hon. Minister should realise that it is out of order to read a speech. <#/>He should convince this House why the Ministry of Health should get this money and also tell us how his Ministry will use this money rather than telling us what his Mi
nistry has achieved since Independence. <#/>We want to know what we will achieve with the money that will be allocated to the Ministry.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Mr. Speaker: <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Order, Mr. Kiliku! <#/>The Minister is giving a pre-view. <#/>Proceed hon. Angatia.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>The Minister for Health}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 (Mr. Angatia): <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must say that I am impressed with the interest that the hon. Members are showing in this Vote. <#/>I hope that they will give me all the money that I am asking for.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have designed v
arious programmes which are helping us achieve these targets that I have set out. <#/>One of this is called Kenya Expanded Programme of Immunisation (KEPI). <#/>This is mainly funded by donors. <#/>As of now, Kenya has achieved 75 percent immunisation of 
i
ts people. <#/>I would like to appeal to our people that we use the funds that are allocated to the Ministry to make sure that we increase immunisations coverage from 75 per cent to 90 per cent. <#/>When we finally achieve 100 per cent, we shall have the 
time to concentrate on other diseases.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, having listed some of these diseases, I would like to say that these programmes are funded mostly by external sources. <#/>These include maternal child health and family planning activities, the K
EPI activities that I have referred to and upper respiratory infection diseases which afflict our children and also adults. <#/>We are very grateful to the international donors who have helped us to maintain these programmes and it is my sincere hope that
 they will continue doing so.
\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on curative activities, I would like to say that we have done very well by building so many hospitals. <#/>However, I would like to ask our people to reduce their tendency to over-rely on medicine. <#/>Whe
n Government gives us enough money we shall do our best to make sure that patients will be treated. <#/>At this point, I would like to tell hon. Members that in the process of expansion, we have put up some health institutions which so far are not functio
ning and I am sure many hon. Members here are aware of the institutions which have been put up, but are not functioning due to lack of staff, drugs or equipment. <#/>This means that the money that was received by the Ministry of Health was not enough.

\par <#/>M
r. Speaker, Sir, just to remind the hon. Members, some of the hospitals we have and we have not put into full use include:- Longisa District Hospital, Vihiga District Hospital, Mokowe District Hospital, and Webuye District Hospital. <#/>The new dispensari
e

\par <#/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, today we have nearly 39,000 people who are infected with AIDS and over 800,000 who have been found to be HIV positive, but who have no
t yet become clinical cases. <#/>If all the 800,000 fell ill today, they would occupy all the bed spaces in the country and we would not have any more bed spaces left. <X_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
When they come to hospital, they are simply coming to wait for death. We do not carr
y out any treatment because there is no drug to treat them. We would like to ask hon. Members and Kenyans in general to look after these patients outside the hospitals because when they come to hospital, they occupy bed space places which would have been 
occupied by people with curable diseases.

: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the Minister to mislead this House that we have no cure for AIDS when a person no less than His Excellency the President announced sometime back that we in Kenya had discovered Kemron?

 (Mr. Angatia): Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I am saying is information which is known by everybody in Kenya and all over the world and I wish hon. Members could allow me to move my Vote wit
hout interruption. They will have two days to debate this issue. They can raise those issues then and I am sure I would be able to respond to those questions very adequately.}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 </X>
