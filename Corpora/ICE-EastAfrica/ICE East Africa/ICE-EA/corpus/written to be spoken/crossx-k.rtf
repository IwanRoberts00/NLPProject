any. <#/>Our office is at Loton Building Koinenga street. <#/>We deal with Danida as Financial Consultants who are financial <-_aiders> to the Government. <#/>Their office is at H.F.C.K. Building. <#/>They have a project in Kitui called the Kitui Integrat
e
d Development Programme. <#/>They (Danida) send money to the Kenya office who pass the finance to the Kitui office and in co-ordination of the Kenya Government development is done, with the money the project involves Water Sector conservation agriculture

h
ey have field officers I work in collaboration of Government officers. <#/>In May 1992 the field officer (Kitui) became aware of financial irregularities and sought for police to investigate the irregularities ie on the field officers his appropriating th
e
 filed money. <#/>There were two stages of investigations. <#/>They were saying about One million shillings could have been misappropriated or even more. <#/>Our task was to confirm whether one million they suspected was misappropriated or much more. <#/>
I concluded the investigations and end of July and June I discovered one million and over had been misappropriated. <#/>This is audit report. <#/>Report MFI one. <#/>I confirmed that 1.043 million had been misappropriated from July 1991.
\par }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>numbers}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
\par <#/>All
 the above totals are 558,527/= they all relate to the activities carried out in respect of the Ministry of Agriculture. <#/>Next is a list of items carried out in respect of the Ministry of Livestock Development. <#/>Three specific items were a voucher o
f
 October 1991 relating to purchases of medicines and medical <-_valities> from Dawa pharmaceutical 20,567/= the voucher describes what was purchased as subject leaders. <#/>We are aware that Dawa pharmaceutical does not sell surgical needles. <#/>On that 
b
asis we concluded that this was a fraudulent transaction. <#/>It was an invoice used to support a train by the land. <#/>The 2nd voucher is of 046 of October 1991 of 50,000/=. <#/>This is the voucher which is meant to account to the Government the money t
a
ken by the account number. <#/>It was for purchase of vaccines from Kyoso Division. <#/>In order to show he has spent all money he was to submit documentation ie vouchers to support expenditure. <#/>In this case we found the expenditure was supported by a
 
Government official receipt number 778788 dated 22.8.91. <#/>The arguments was that a government receipt is not a valid receipt to support the expenditure. <#/>No one would expect the invoice to be from the supplier. <#/>So on that basis we did not accept
 
the receipt as legal supporting document for the expenditure and no explanation given we concluded the money was fraudulently spent. <#/>Voucher 046 - MFI 2 receipt number 778788 MFI 3. <#/>I see this photocopy of a receipt shows the amount to be 10/= onl
y. <#/>It is dated 26.9.91 photocopy MFI 4 certified as a true copy of the original.
\par <#/>Investigation concluded at the end of July and we submitted our report to Davida at the same time with advice that action be taken through lawyers and if necessary invo

\par <#/>I
 copied the report involving 5 ministries named earlier. <#/>I have signed it and I wish to produce the same as exhibit in court. <#/>Exhibit 1. <#/>The information in the report was out of interviews of project management observed documentation in the ma

o
f 1742 bags. <#/>This a bin card record kept in the stores. <#/>It is the control card in the store. <#/>This relates to DAP missing fertilizer and it is for the period 6.3.91 to 16.5.91 (marked Mfl 35). <#/>This is the office record for the same DAP fert
i
lizer. <#/>We call it Kardex. <#/>It is number 80312 and the second Kardex is 80281 of the same fertilizer but it is kept in the office. <#/>There are two movements of fertilizers. <#/>There movement-in and <-_>and<-/> movement-out that is dispatch and re
c
eipt. <#/>When the clerk in the go-down receives the fertilizer he <-_entered><+_enters> it in into <-/Freight> book and then he transfers the same quantity into the bin card. <#/>After this he <-_write><+_writes> out another record called KGGCU 58 transf

.
\par <#/>After we had up-dated our cardex we forward the original of KGGCU 58 and original of the <-/Freight> book to our <-/Head> office and we retain duplicates. <#/>The second transaction is dispatch which is movement out. <#/>Here the clerk must get author
ity from the <-/ware house> manager to dispatch anything from the warehouse. <#/>The authority goes to the clerk in form of inter branch transfer (IBT). <#/>We call it KGGCU 50. <#/>The clerk receives the IBTs signed by the manager. <#/>When the clerk rec
e
ives IBTs he releases the quantity he is authorised to dispatch. <#/>He <-/cant> release anything unless he has authority in IBTs form. <#/>Orders are normally released to our branches not individuals. <#/>After dispatch the IBTS is taken back to our offi

When my boss authorised the cashier paid. When the cashier came back to me she showed me an authority letter (Mfl 2) which I did not think was satisfactory. I refused to authorise the payment in the circumstances. I
 told the cashier not to pay anyone but the account holder. We were not able to recover the documents which changed the name of the account holder of 1/1200 from <name/> to <name/> Looking at Mfl 4B the payment of <-/shs.> 75,000/- was posted on 15.46 hrs
.
 Sometimes this happens before a person has been paid as there may be receiver cashiers than the operators in the operators in the computer room. The timing is not very accurate. Sometimes keying in was done after payment. You did not indicate to me that 
y

 and you were showing her (Mfl 2) authority which she did not think was satisfactory. }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 </X>

\par }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>My name is <name/>. <#/>I am <-/Mananging Director> of Private <-/proximate> Insurance <-/brokers> Limited. <#/>I know the accused <-/Person> he had approached in early 1989 for <-/Employment>. <#/>He had worked elsewhere in th
e <-/Industry> and I requested him to join us on temporary basis pending his performance.
\par <#/>He finally joined us in March 1989 and I assigned him accounts executive. <#/>These are the people who attend to clients who come for <-/Insurance> services.
\par <#/>His main duties were to attend to clients and issue with <-/Insurance> company to obtain certificates for them.
\par <#/>His performance was good because he is capable but there were things which hindered his permanent employment because we got complaints of previous which he never paid to the <-/Company>.
\par <#/>In may 1990 I was planning to go to an overseas trip. <#/>Two weeks earlier there were </conplaints> regarding these clients were my close friends.
\par <#/>When they came to complain I asked the accused to stop working until I came back from my trip. <#/>I suspended the accused.
\par <#/>I came back in June 1990 at around 20th. <#/>From London I rang the office and learnt there was a serious problem where a customer had been issued a temporary certificate.
\par <#/>In April 1990 some cover notes had been issued which I had no knowledge of. <#/>The client wanted permanent certificate because he had paid the required premiums. <#/>I was told the client was told the client was making a lot of noise.
\par <#/>When I came back I realized Mr. <name/> was involved. <#/>There was no evidence in my office that the client had paid.
\par <#/>The <-/clietn> is <name/> who had insured hit two vehicles. <#/>I talked to <name/> when I came back and I asked him who he had paid. <#/>He told me it wa
s the accused. <#/>He produced a note given to him purporting to be receipts (shown MFI I). <#/>The amount was <-/shs.> 11,000/= and the 2nd is <-/shs.> 21,000/=.
\par <#/>These were in respect of <-/Motor> vehicles KZH 002 and KAA 788D. <#/>The <-_complainant><+_complainant's> slips did not state what the payments were for.
\par <#/>I recognise these as Mr. <name/>'s hand writing and the signature is his.
\par <#/>The normal procedure is that money is paid to cashier or accountant who issues receipts and we have never run short of the receipts.
\par <#/>I checked and I found no records of Mr. <name/>. <#/>I checked from cash sales register.
\par <#/>This is a sales ledger (<-/Marked> MFI 2). <#/>I checked in the month of April and there was no entry of Mr. <name/>.
\par <#/>Mr. <name/> had started coming to our office in April 1990. <#/>I wondered why Mr. <name/> paid the money without receipts. <#/>I <-/adviced> him to go and take any action dee

\par <#/>My assistant <-/Manager> is <name/>. <#/>I called Mr. <name/> and I paid him money and this was a big loss to my <-/Company>. <#/>Because of the complication the matter of the accused's employment was left pending. <#/>He is still suspended.

 accused and yet the robbery took place at 10.00 a.m. during the day. <#/>PW 3 said he had seen a police <-/m.v> along the road and later heard that there was theft. <#/>But he never saw anybody himself; nor anybody <-/alighing> from the police m/v go to 
the house.
\par <#/>P.W. 4 in cross examination said he did not know those who told him there was a theft. <#/>She only produced a work ticket which says the car was supposed to be moving in Nairobi. <#/>First accused has given a <-/plainsible> explanation as to

s requesting that he be paid from the treasury. <#/>Having looked at the cheque I noticed that it had been endorsed by all the signatories, and at the bank the Deputy District Accountant had also endorsed it for cash payment so I asked the payee to produc
e
 his ID card but he did not have it, so Mr. <name/> Identified him as being known to him so having no doubt that Mr. <name/> as the District trade officer knew the trader well I paid the cash to the trade. <#/><Name/> signed the cheque that the payee was 
k
nown to him. <#/>The cheque was for 20,000/=. <#/>Cheque No. 136620 21.2.90 to <name/> Kshs. 20,000/= it was also brought by a trader who was introduced by Mr. <name/>, he wanted the cheque cashed. <#/>This trader also did not have his ID card. <#/>I aske
d
 Mr. <name/> whether he knew the trader and Mr. <name/> said yes and identified him and signed at the back of the cheque. <#/>I paid the cash to our trader. <#/>The cheque Is number 136620. <#/>Mr. <name/> was signing. <#/>In his capacity as the secretary
 of the joint loan board. <#/>So I had no doubts because he was the one dealing with these traders and I knew that he knew very well. <#/>136620 dated 21.2.90.
\par <#/>In the name of <name/>. <#/>The cheque was brought by a trader whom I <-_didnt><+_didn't> kno
w so after asking him for his ID he said he did not have it. <#/>So the trader went back to the District trade office and he came back with Mr. <name/> who identified him and signed at the back and put a Rubber stamp as well. <#/>And sure it had also been
 authorised to be encashed, by the accountant I paid it. <#/>I was familiar with <name/>\rquote 
s handwriting and signature, so I paid one cheque. <#/>Cheque No. 136618 21.2.90. <#/>Payable to <name/> for Kshs. 20,000/= who also did not have the identification car
d, He came in the company of Mr. <name/> who also identified the payee to me, after this, I paid the Trader 20,000/=.
\par <#/>I paid the pension because there was an authorisation by the District Accountant and Mr. <name/> had identified the payee by signing and putting the official Rubber stamp.
\par <#/>Cheque 136615 name <name/> of 13.11.89. <#/>The payee did not come to my office in person. <#/>According to Mr. <name/> the payee had endorsed the cheque to be payable to the District trade Development office. <#/>
So after the endorsement, Mr. <name/> had paid the payee from the Revenue collection of his office. <#/>So the cheque came into my possession as part of the District Development Revenues collection issued a receipt and a contra-cheque, for the Revenue col
lected by <name/>.
\par }{\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 <#/>Cross examined by Accused:
\par }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Even by 1989 I was the acting District Cashier.     
\par <#/>My boss was <name/> the District Accountant. <#/>We normally encash pension and intentional cheques with authority. <#/>No cheque can be encashed without authority.
\par <#/>Payment can only be given on with authority of the DC, DOC, District Accountant or his assistant, by signing at the back of the cheque. <#/>A trade officer cannot give authority to cash the cheque.
\par <#/>His signature at the back is va
lid for identification. <#/>Your signature was valid because the pensions involved were traders. <#/>Socially I met you only a few times. <#/>I paid the traders without their ID cards because you identified them as being well known to you, because the che
q
ues originated from your office and you <-/propossed> the cheques of this people. <#/>I had no reason to doubt you since you were a senior Government officer. <#/>You came with the traders to my office . <#/>The cheques had ID card numbers on the cheques 
but they did not produce the ID card. <#/>I did not ask you to sign twice and I cannot recollect whether you signed in my office or in the <-_accountants><+_accountant\rquote 
s> office. <#/>The fifth cheque was brought by yourself as part of your Revenue collections. <#/>This was not in order, but since it was authorised by the accountant I could not question him.
\par <#/>I know one <name/> a clinical officer in Isiolo but he is not the <name/> that you brought to me.
\par }{\f0\fs24\ul\lang2057 <#/>Re-examined by CP:
\par }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Yes I knew the accused very well and in the course of official duties Yes I was very familiar with his signature and handwriting, and he personally accompanied the payees and identified them.
