\par }{\b\fs24 Re Apple Mango Seedlings}{\fs24 
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24 I am writing in response to Dr <name/>'s fax of 19th February 1996. <#/>We are pleased that Dr <name/> can support us in finding the mango seedlings. <#/>We respond below to his questions:
\par <#/>- The mango trees we are looking for are to be interplanted with other crops; usually annual crops such as maize, beans and groundnuts. <#/>We also have other trees including citrus and bananas.
\par <#/>All the farmers who will get these seedlings have already planted mangoes. <#/>The varieties planted include Tommy Artkins and local varieties (Dodo, Boribo, Mviringo etc).
\par <#/>We do not have nurseries, the Tommy Artkins we obtain from the Tanga Region Integrated Project which was funded by GTZ. <#/>The local varieties we usually obtain seedlings }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 that have germinated on their own in the fields or in compounds.
\par <#/>The objective of growing these apple mangoes is for consumption and selling to local markets with increase volumes }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 , we will be looking for regional and export markets in Europe and }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 Middle East.
\par <#/>So far, we are a group of 25 farmers from Mwanga District, who are looking for these seedlings. <#/>Our district already has a GTZ forestry project. <#/>This pr
oject has nurseries which are run by local farmers. <#/>It is therefore feasible to have a base on which to <-_built> a capacity to <-/propergate> more mango seedling }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
. <#/>If this is done, more farmers will take up the seedlings.
\par <#/>There are 
potentials for grafting the apple mango varieties with local mangoes. <#/>What is missing is the <-/know how>. <#/>Mwanga District is already <-/propergating> grafted citrus fruits; oranges and tangerines. <#/>With guidance, we can transfer this <-_know h
ow> to our district. <#/>If it is possible we can send farmers to Kenya to learn this technique.
\par <#/>The Tommy Artkins that I am growing are in Dar es Salaam. <#/>They were grafted at Tanga. <#/>I have also over 700 citrus trees which were all grafted, whic
h I am interplanting with coconuts. <#/>I will be more than pleased to show you my farm. <#/>I have recently introduced bees to my fruit farm, and they complement each other. <#/>I have grown my fruit trees in a natural way. <#/>I do not use chemical fert
ilizers nor chemicals.
\par <#/>If the seedlings are readily available, we would take them anytime now because our long rain season is about to start. <#/>I hope you will find the above response adequate for your response to Dr. <name/>.
\par <#/>P.S. We heard of the
 apple mangoes from farmers in Taveta, which is very close to our district, Mwanga. <#/>If the seedlings can be obtained from there we could easily arrange to collect them. <#/>Since Mr Toroka contacted you, we have been talking to other farmers who are a
lso very keen to have these varieties. <#/>Based on the numbers mentioned, we can take up to 1000 seedlings.

\par }{<#/>}{\fs24 The letter with Ref. <number/> dated 16th June, 1994 on the above subject refers }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 . <#/>We have received the said summary.
\par <#/>May I draw your attention to para 5.1.6 concerning the current and future status of I.P.I. <#/>This Institute as you may be aware, was established in 1989 under }{\fs24\ul order}{\fs24 
, made under Section 21(4) of the University of Dar es Salaam Act, of 1970 and subsequently published on 6th October, 1989 in Government Notice No.326.
\par <#/>According to the agreement and regulations for the establishment of IPI, its aims and objectives are defined as follows:-
\par <#/>"The Institute shall be a link between the FoE and Tanzanian industry in order to foster the mutual utilization of knowledge and facilities.
\par <#/>The three main objectives are:-
\par (a) Product innovation up to prototype production and subsequent transfer to a suitable industry.
\par <#/>(b) Consultancy and services to industry.
\par <#/>(c) The Institute will supply curriculum advice to the FoE through its feedback from industry.
\par <#/>Close cooperation between the IPI and the FoE is presumed in all the above mentioned aspects but individual technical developments on either side shall not be excluded.
\par <#/>A recent valuation report (April 1993 - Feb. 1994) sponsored by GTZ, on the Reorientation of IPI it was revealed }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  that the IPI had had same problem }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 like most of R & Ds in this country because "transfer of local R & D results to industry had not been achieved," at the same }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>idiom}{\fs24 
, however, the evaluation team identified some encouraging factors and development, leading them to recommend to continue }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  support for the project.
\par <#/>The Ministry is in full agreement with this stand, and has no <-/intetion> of <-/disolving> the IPI. <#/>Indeed, <-/intergrating> IPI premises and equipment into the Faculty of Engineering would be contrary to the spirit of the }{\fs24\ul order}{
\fs24  which created the IPI as well as the Ministry's Sector Policy Paper which has identified some of these institutes for promotion into Centres of Basic Research or even Centres of excellence.
\par <#/>I tend to believe that our delegation did not have these important data at their disposal, hence the suggest
ion "to look into the possibilities of <-/intergrating> IPI into the Faculty of engineering. <#/>This would not be in the interest of the Mission of the University.

\par <#/>Thank you for inviting me to the SECAP Steering Committee meeting of 3rd August, 1995. <#/>Unfortunately I received the letter on 7/08/1995; sorry I could not attend.
\par <#/>Meanwhile, having gone through the minutes of the 63rd Committee-Meeting of 12th April, 1995, some of the issues discussed are of particular concern to this Office; I would like to comment on a few as follows:-
\par <#/>}{\fs24\ul THE FUTURE OF LIVESTOCK QUARANTINE STATION:
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24 It is true that the R.D.D's Office would not support (financially or otherwise) the running of this station as a Government Service/or project component. <#/>However; in case SECAP would like to dispose it}{\fs24\ul 
, the station should be handed-over to the Lusboto District Council}{\fs24 . <#/>It will be up to the Council to decide whether to continue running it as part of its livestock development strategy or }{\b\v\fs24 <+_to>}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 
privatize the station. <#/>A copy of the handing-over protocol should be submitted to the Regional Development Director.
\par <#/>}{\fs24\ul HANDING-OVER OF VEHICLES:
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24 Last year, SECAP under the direction of its Steering Committe
e handed-over a number of motor-cycles to employees including those outside Government departments; this became an issue of contention between SECAP and this Office. <#/>(Ref. our letter <number/> of 4th May, 1994). <#/>I would like to advise that, dispos
al of vehicles no longer required by the project should follow procedures as laid down in R.D.D's letter Ref. No: <number/> of 1st March, 1995/ 
\par <#/>}{\fs24\ul GENERAL ISSUES:
\par }{\fs24 - }{<#/>}{\fs24 Under the project agreement concluded on 3rd March, 1994 between F.R.G. and Tanzania Government, }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>orth}{\b\fs24  }{\fs24 
The Regional Development Director, Tanga, is charged with the responsibility of implementing the project on behalf of the recipient government. <#/>Su
rprisingly, for years, The R.D.D. (or representative) has not been a member of the Project Steering Committee. <#/>It is therefore logical that the composition of the Steering Committee should be revised.
\par <#/>- Since the Original Project concept (agro-silv
o-pastoral-concept) was devised in the 1980's with its accompanying implementation strategies (extension services, self-help, community participation, village based entry point, etc) several social, economic and political changes have taken place particul
arly in terms }{\b\v\fs24 <+_of>}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 national policy direction.
\par <#/>Having implemented the project for more than 10 years, and taking into consideration the current policy changes; it becomes <-/neccessary> to revisit the project concept and its strategies in their totalit
y, so as to determine an appropriate future direction. <#/>Making adjustments in piece-meal may not be ideal. <#/>(For example the selling of tree seedlings as a measure of policy on cost-recovery makes it <-/neccessary> to review and reformulate project 
objectives, target groups, etc).

\par }{<#/>}{\fs24 Thank you for a copy of your letter addressed to GTZ - Germany, ref No. <number/>, dated 4/9/95 concerning the above mentioned topic.
\par <#/>We have gone through the letter and the revised document proposal and noted, as you observed, it is true that a complete overview of the project is required in the areas you mentioned before final agreement is made.
\par <#/>We all know that we are dealing with an emergency situation and not a normal development Programme. <#/>Due
 to pressure from refugees and the local community the environment is grossly damaged. <#/>Without immediate intervention there is a danger of having the problem much pronounced }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 and more difficult to address. <#/>We, therefore, believe that GTZ-HQ will respond soon and avoid delayed implementation of this crucial programme.
\par <#/>Last but not least we feel that it is important to involve/incorporate the Refugee Affected Areas Rehabilitation Coordination Unit (Prime Minister's Office) in all discus
sions and implementation of this programme. <#/>This will among other things ensure smooth coordination and avoid duplication of assistance extended to the refugees affected areas.
\par <#/>Thank you for your cooperation.

\par }{<#/>}{\fs24 We acknowledge receipt of your proposal of 21.07.95 (ref. <number/>) for EU contribution to the above captioned project in a co-financing arrangement with the German Government (BMZ).
\par <#/>During discussions of the proposal with your local office in Dar es Salaam on 31.08.95 (<name/>/<name/>) we have been asked }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24 
 to confirm that the EU contribution is available. <#/>We can indeed confirm that The Special Rehabilitation Programme referred to has been allocated an amount of ECU 3,000,000 from the 7th European Development Fund under account no. <number/>, of whi
ch ECU 800,000 has been earmarked for the Environmental Component. <#/>The Financing Agreement for the Programme was signed by the European Commission and the United Republic of Tanzania in March 1995 and disbursement on other components of the Programme 
have started in June }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24 
. <#/>The Financing Agreement stipulates that implementation of the Environmental Component will take place through GTZ. <#/>All the funds are therefore available for start of contractual procedures.
\par <#/>Before such procedures can start we need, however, some further information on the total project for co-financing. <#/>Your proposal of 21.07.95 does not give a complete overview of the project. <#/>In particular the budget is deficient as it only pre
s
ents details of what the EU should contribute and no <-/deatils> at all are given as to the estimate of the assumed Government contribution of DM 150,000 (page 21). <#/>We would at least expect to receive an updated Project Planning Matrix (logical framew
ork) as well as a related, complete and detailed budget with financing plan (BMZ/GTZ,EU, Government of Tanzania). <#/>The format used in the Project Appraisal Report of March 1995 (annexes 6 & 7) would be appropriate.
\par <#/>As regards your Financial Proposal,
 we cannot make any final comments until the missing information referred to above has been received. <#/>We have two points, however, to make at this stage. <#/>Firstly, we will have to investigate internally if it is acceptable and advantageous to inclu
de the entire EDF contribution in one service contract. <#/>It may be necessary to contract overseas equipment supplies and local operating costs/purchases separately. <#/>Secondly, we believe that periodic evaluation shall be contracted }{\b\v\fs24 
<&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24  separately with an independent consultant.
\par <#/>We hope that this information will help you to make further progress in preparation of the project as we would like to see the assistance to the refugee affected areas becoming effective without delay.

\par }{<#/>}{\fs24 We have the honour }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>idiom}{\fs24  to approach you with a request for loan/grant financing to facilitate a management and employee take over of Tanzania Publishing House Limited (THP).
\par <#/>THP is a small size state owned enterprise (SOE) operating in the paper conversion sector. <#/>It has a current labour force of 26 people including the management. <#/>The government holds 100% of its shares through the Tanzania Karatasi Associated In
dustries (TKAI), the government holding corporation in the paper sector.
\par <#/>THP's mission and objective is the promotion of the indigenous publishing industry through publication of a wide variety of books and reading materials focusing particularly on tex
tbooks, reference and general books. <#/>TPH is the leading local publishing house with publishing rights of over 300 titles in both English and Swahili. <#/>TPH is also one of the designated publishers for the Ministry of Education and Culture of a numbe
r of Primary and Secondary school textbooks.
\par <#/>The ongoing implementation of the divestiture of State Owned Enterprises also affects TPH. <#/>The company is envisaged as a good candidate for divestiture through a Management and Employee Buy Out (MEBO) sch
eme by virtue of its small size and the fact that its major productive assets are intangible and are constituted by its employees.
\par <#/>The management and employees have prepared and presented a MEBO proposal to the Presidential Parastatal Sector Reform Com
mission (PSRC). <#/>The proposal is concretised by a seven year business plan (1995-2001) which has an appropriate financial analysis and a sensitivity analysis too. <#/>(A copy of the proposal is available on request).
\par <#/>We are glad to inform you that t
his MEBO proposal has been accepted by PSRC. <#/>The price of the company has also been accepted at TShs. 71 million. <#/>Consequently, PSRC has demanded to be furnished with written evidence, before January 31, 1995, of our ability either to pay the inte
nded cash or to borrow the necessary funds as of the target acquisition of 51% (i.e. TShs.36 million) of the shares of the company.
\par <#/>The management and employees are eager to contribute some of their meagre benefits to raise a portion of the purchase pri
ce. <#/>Such a contribution, while amounting to considerable sacrifice on the employees' part, will really only constitute a token sum of the requirement, bearing in mind the prevailing salary structures. <#/>It is in this regard that we are now approachi
ng you for your support, through provision of loan or grant financing of the MEBO scheme. <#/>The amount being sought is in the range of TShs. 20 million to TShs. 30 million.
\par <#/>You may also wish to know that as of present TPH is free from any encumbrances
 arising out of debt financing. <#/>It has, though, a low level of liabilities arising out of normal trade debts such as credit facilities extended by its business associates.
\par <#/>We shall be grateful to receive your tentative response with indications of your preliminary feelings on this request. <#/>Moreover, we are looking forward to your cooperation with the management and employees of TPH in this scheme.
\par <#/>Please feel free to ask for any information deemed necessary to facilitate your decision making.
\par <#/>We wish you a prosperous and peaceful 1995.

\par <#/>The government  has not shown any positive action in educating the people especially the rural Swahili speaking population who comprise the most of the <-_electorates>
<+_electorate>. <#/>The leaders of government and the CCM leaders have been going around the Country telling the people that joining other political Parties equals to treason. <#/>On the part of the Opposition Parties, they <-/dont> have resources to reac

\par <#/>TAHURET is a registered NGO with the aim of human rights education and
 Justice Protection. <#/>Since then we have been using the "Political Platform" in educating our people to understand their rights. <#/>Also, the Chairman has, on several <-/occations> been used by one NGO to conduct seminars on democratization.
\par <#/>TAHURET has qualified personnel to involve in the democratization process. <#/>We are sending this request to consider funding us so that we can conduct several seminars. <#/>I am ready to come for more details at your <-/convinience>.

\par <#/>I have been following UNICEF efforts since years back and this conference in Vienna will enrich my interest in children particularly their welfare and using my enrichment I will write much on my return for the advancement of their welfare.

\par <#/>On behalf of the Board of Trustees I have the Honour of introducing the Tanzania Youth Development and Employment Foundation (T.Y.D.E.F.).
\par <#/>Since its inception (1987) the Tanzania Youth Development and E
mployment Foundation (TYDEF) has ignited the imagination of a great many people at grassroot levels in the informal sector in D'Salaam region who have registered with us over 900 (nine hundred groups) of five to ten members per enterprise making an averag
e of 6,000 (six thousand) people. <#/>Still more are coming.
\par <#/>The Tanzania Youth Development and Employment Foundation (TYDEF) last year managed to secure UNDP funded assistance to the tune of US $ 503,000 geared towards TYDEF institutional building with ILO as the Executing Agency.
\par <#/>Fortunately after securing the <-/finacial> Assistance from the UNDP; though the Project Document provided for a two year period of project activities before handing over to TYDEF at a Tripartite Meeting between UNDP/ILO/T
he Government and TYDEF held on the 18th February 1993 changes were made and it was resolved that:
\par (a) A technical Assessment team be assembled within three months after the Tripartite meeting to study TYDEF Administrative and Management capacity with a view of }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24 
 handing over Project activities to TYDEF. <#/>Modalities towards assembling the Technical Team to carry out the work would be the responsibility of the UNDP and ILO.
\par <#/>(b) TYDEF should raise the 5.0 million shillings required to cover local costs in the final year of the project.
\par <#/>For us TYDEF this is a very positive response from our Donor and we feel an obligation of meeting }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  the local costs component and experience has taught us that whenever we request assistance from frie
ndly Governments and whenever there is an objective reasoning for it we do meet receptive ears }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>idiom}{\fs24 .
\par <#/>Since our request would reflect concrete <-/acheivement> of the grassroot itself of which we are a sensitising organ I hope we won't have gone very far }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>idiom}{\fs24 
 when we request assistance of at least a half <-/forthe> 5 million shillings earmarked.

\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\ul Tanzania Gender Networking Programme seminar series - Beijing feedback - 7 October 1995 (Saturday)
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24 Tanzania Gender Networking Programme participated in the just ended UN World Conference on Women in Beijing '95. <#/>On 27/9/95, as part of TGNP Wednesday Gender and Devel
opment Seminar series, TGNP delegates to Beijing Conference organized a feedback seminar at its offices along Azikiwe Street, CRDB building (opposite New Post Office). <#/>The seminar was attended by about 70 people. <#/>A high level of participation took
 
place in the discussions which followed the presentations, but time was too short to cover all the issues and plan action. <#/>People felt the need for more publicity, partly to counteract the largely indifferent and, sometimes negative reporting about Be
ijing in local and international media.
\par <#/>A request was put forward that TGNP organize a similar event for a whole day with a wider coverage and a larger audience and to specifically focus on action oriented programmes with follow-up activities among TGNP
 networkers and other NGOs. <#/>The above <-/mentionfirmed> for the seminar is Saturday 7 October 1995.
\par <#/>TGNP would feel very honoured to have your presence and participation at the above-mentioned seminar which will be held at the British Council from 8.30 a.m. to 3.00 p.m. <#/>Soda and bites will be provided.
\par <#/>The objective of the workshop are as follows:-
\par 1. Dissemination of information in detail regarding decisions made in Beijing.
\par <#/>2. Suggestions regarding different steps taken by organizations, for the Beijing plan of action.
\par <#/>3. To arrange for plan of action.
\par <#/>4. Feedback on the media coverage

\par <#/>Regarding TGNP activities especially Voter Education at the moment, we have had good successes and are proceeding with the exercise.
\par <#/>On Friday we are organizing a peaceful rally in:
\par - congratulating women contestants, politicians and those aspiring for political posts
\par - to urge all political parties to dis-agree without fighting
\par - for a change, to get politicians to listen to the campaigns of the people (what they want for their country to the year 2010)
\par - to urge the community to use their rights by voting for an appropriate leader who meets stipulated leadership qualities
\par - to remind the community that this is the International year for Peace and Tolerance
\par - and finally to avail space for women going to Beijing China to show in clear terms what our mission is.

\par <#/>Also PAUKWA group members (attached please see a leaflet on who they are and what they do) will begin the COMMUNITY <-/THEATER> on voter education project sponsored by KAF next week in Bagamoyo.
\par <#/>We have dared advance financial facilitation of the project <-/inspite> of the fact that the funds have not come to TGNP account. <#/>We trust that funding will come through as presented in the Project proposal submitted to you soon.

\par }{<#/>}{\fs24 I have the honour to respond to the request, assumingly yours, that I should give you an <-/assesment> report on the above.
\par <#/>I do not read nor speak German. <#/>But I have read Mr. Tandika\rquote s text thoroughly well. <#/>My reaction includes the following points.
\par <#/>}{\fs24\ul General:}{\fs24 
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24 Kiswahili as a Tanzanian language is very well established, from the grassroots to top academic as well as political leaders.
\par <#/>As an African language, East, central 
and Southern Africa is very well covered by Kiswahili. <#/>There is no country in this zone that users of the language can be absent. <#/>The Somalia, Ethiopia and Sudanese zone, partly East African, partly northern and practically one of its own, also te
aches and uses Kiswahili. <#/>In Egypt, they teach it at University level and announce it in their RADIO. <#/>In West Africa they teach it in Ghana, Nigeria and little of it in Guinea.
\par <#/>Obviously, Kiswahili has developed as one of world languages.
\par <#/>Its significance is both academic and social. <#/>It has a natural Force which attracts various people to learn it.
\par <#/>}{\fs24\ul This translation:
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24 Translation of one language into another, always opens up new revenues. <#/>New concepts, words, expressions etc. ar
e brought into being. <#/>Ideas are shared and relations established. <#/>Translation is one big way of bringing about educational growth of a nation or of a people. <#/>At the present stage of the history of Kiswahili, at which modern science and <-/etec
hnology> take their rightful places, translation of academic books is essentially useful and very instrumental in bringing about the necessary changes.
\par <#/>I have noted with interest the coverage that Tandika\rquote s translation has: Official and national languag
es classification of countries based on languages, Language and politics, Dialects and Languages Planning, Language and Society, problems of standardization, Africa and its languages - Kiswahili, Husa, Mandingo; Ethnicity and Language and Expectation that
 book offers etc.
\par <#/>These are very relevant topics of discussion both in academic circles as well as in social political groups.
\par <#/>At our Institute of Kiswahili Research, we have just started serious work on dialectology and there is a very not discussi
on going on about the real Mswahili and her language Kiswahili. <#/>In Africa, we are still very divided due to language differences and linguistic attitudes. <#/>No body can deny this fact that this translation has some answers to these questions. <#/>Th
e title itself as Tandika suggests, LUGHA, JAMII NA MAWASILIANO AFRICA offers attraction, logic and understanding of our major problems in language planning and developments.
\par <#/>Kiswahili has borrowed German expressions and concepts in this translation for example <ea_>lugha inayotumika na wengi<ea/> instead of our old <ea_>lugha ya kati<ea/> for lingua franca.
\par <#/>}{\fs24\ul Possible Users}{\fs24 
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24 The Ministry of Education is the only organ in Tanzania which recommends books to be used at specific levels of its students.
 <#/>As it is, it is a book which interests general readers whose number can be estimated at ten to twenty thousand copies. <#/>For schools, it fits into secondary, colleges and the University. <#/>For this another twenty thousand would be the minimum. <#
/>Let ten other thousands be for our neighbourly readers in Kenya, Burundi and Rwanda.
\par <#/>The sponsor should pay for the publication of the book so that the buying price remains at a subsidy.
\par <#/>}{\fs24\ul Conclusion}{\fs24 
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24 Tanzania is now very bad in need of good book
s. <#/>This translation is one of the on-going efforts to fill the gap. <#/>It is my sincere hope that this translation shall be published accordingly and immediately. <#/><name/> of the Institute of Kiswahili Research can check the perfection of the tran
slation (if it has not been done) and <name/> of BAKITA can quickly and well enough edit the manuscript for publication.
\par <#/>This exercise shall prove positively towards developing kiswahili which is your rightful offer to Tanzanian\rquote s cultural growth and Development.

\par <#/>}{<#/>}{\fs24 Thank you very much for your kind letter of invitation.
\par <#/>I must admit that I have been away for a very long time, probably ran away from your office. <#/>I was always thinking of paying a visit to your office, but time never allowed me to do so.
\par <#/>As soon as I received the money from your Embassy through y
our kind efforts I started to roll about here and there. <#/>I managed to travel up to Winde an old Sea side town, very historic which lies between Bagamoyo and Saadan where I had to do a bit of research.
\par <#/>I returned here and began to decipher some very
 old <-_informations><+_information>. <#/>My work seems to be progressing well and I am happy at this moment to say that I have about 3,000 main entries and about 1,800 sub entries while my Data Bank is still rich about one half of the total number alread
y <-/sloted> in.
\par <#/>However it is too early now to predict its expected figure, but I will be able to do so as soon as I get the writing Cards which I hope to secure some very soon. <#/>These will be about 10,000 which I hope they will suffice.
\par <#/>I am gl
ad to tell you that I am now working on two projects at a time i. e. Cultural Dictionary and Etymology Dictionary based on Coastal towns and villages along the Tanzanian coast. <#/>The Etymo. has about 1,800 names of towns etc. with their very secret mean
ing.
\par <#/>As soon as I push them in hard Cards, I shall then be in possession to inform the Embassy about the progress of the work.
\par <#/>Thank you once again for all that you have done in this connection.
\par <#/>Hoping to see you at the Aniceti Kitereza\rquote s Exhibition.

\par <#/><foreign_>Vielen Dank<foreign/> for your letter of 13/1/1991. <#/>Unfortunately it arrived while I was on a month-long Safari, hence I could not reply in time.
\par <#/>Now, regarding your queries, and requests, I can only advise as follows:
\par 1. I can send you my photo if you really need it TPH had a photo that I took together with the late <name/> in 1975. <#/>I do not know whether they still have it; I will contact them on the matter.
\par <#/>2. The most important 5 - 6 Tanzanian writers of this century, in my view, are:
\par   1. The late Shaaban Robert (died 1962)
\par   2. The late Mathias Mayampala (died 1969)
\par   3. The late M. S. Abdulla (died 20/2/1991)
\par   4. E. Kezilahabi (a relative of Kitereza) still writing
\par   5. Ebrahim Hussein (still writing)
\par   6. Penina Muhando (still writing).
\par <#/>I suggest that we get their photos for the exhibition. <#/>The cost of a good, framed photograph of each of the authors will be about T-Sh. 8000/=. <#/>Hence the cost of the 6 photos will be about 8000x6=48000/= (US $ 250/=).
\par <#/>3. Kitereza got his theological education at Rubya (Roman Catholic) Seminary in Bukoba, North-Western Tanzania. <#/>I have no <-/ducuments> or photos from that period and place. <#/>However, it may be necessary to send someone there to get them i
. e. if we intend to have a really authentic exhibition. <#/>This may involve some costs (travelling, subsistence, <-/hotocopying>, etc.). <#/><-/Alternatuvely>, one could request Rubya Seminary to supply the material gratis by post, hoping that they woul
d oblige.
\par <#/>For all these reasons, this material cannot possibly be sent to you by the end of March.
\par <#/>4. Fr. <name/> from Canada was Kitereza\rquote s <-/acquintance>, and is said to have taken to Canada a typescript of the Kikerebe version of Kitereza\rquote s nove

\par <#/>You probably rem
ember me. <#/>I am a lawyer - cum - journalist, who has maintained a weekly column in 'BUSINESS TIMES' since the Newspaper was born in November 1988. <#/>Through this column called 'WITH A LEGAL TOUCH' I have persistently crusaded for democracy and socio-
economic reform in Tanzania. <#/>I was closely associated with the founding of the weekly and have remained a faithful supporter of its development.
\par <#/>Besides, I write another column in the same business weekly called 'TALKING BUSINESS' under a pen-name of Bob Wemu.
\par <#/>Sir, you may also like to know that I was a member of a committee of experts which planned the birth of THE BUSINESS newspaper in the city three years ago. <#/>My visible contribution to the paper is a weekly column called 'THE RULE OF LAW'
 in the SUNDAY EXPRESS.
\par <#/>To cap it all, I was recently appointed a columnist in a brand newcomer on the media horizon, THE EAST AFRICAN. <#/>This is a sister paper of DAILY NATION OF Kenya.
\par <#/>May I also mention in passing that I was last April appointed a member of the UN Observer Mission on the first democratic general elections of South Africa.
\par <#/>In August, I was privileged to be one of East African experts who discussed the revival of the EA Community at Conference held in Kampala, Uganda.
\par <#/>In 
short, I humbly and respectfully request you, Jorg, to support my burning desire to attend the forthcoming summit in Copenhagen. <#/>You could kindly pay for my return air - ticket and for my stay in the city during the important gathering. <#/>I firmly b
elieve that my attendance and/or participation in the meeting will help broaden my orientation and improve my skills. <#/>It will hopefully open to me new ways of contributing to the war against poverty in Tanzania.

\par }{\fs24 <I> }{<#/>}{\fs24 Dear Sir,
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24 Re: Administration of Company Development Programme (CDP)
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24 The subject above refers.
\par <#/>As it is known to each one of us, the implementation of each session of CDP is phased sequentially.
\par <#/>The first phase is class-work. <#/>This involves lecturing, followed by workshops. <#/>Lecturers are given by resource persons and they are very condensed. <#/>The purpose of su
ch lectures is to provide participants with some analytical tools which they are made to apply immediately in diagnosing and x-raying the company of every participant when the participants have constituted themselves into a five member workshop group. <#/
>Since there are twenty participants in the CDP, this means there are four workshops each consisting of five members. <#/>The workshops are conducted simultaneously, and they all focus on the same theme.
\par <#/>The other phase is the so-called shadow Board Mee
tings. <#/>This comes up after the first phase, that is, class-work has been completed. <#/>The five members who form one workshop during class-work, constitute themselves into Shadow Board members. <#/>Acting and behaving as real Board Members of the Com
pany of every participant, the shadow Board members are required to analyse financial ratios, production/marketing matrix, strength and weakness of each Company, incentive package (motivation), time usage, competition, etc.
\par <#/>The <-/skillful> administrati
on/co-ordination by SICATA of the two phases of each session in the CDP is of critical importance to the achievement of our (SICATA) objective - namely the transfer of technology (specifically soft-ware) which unquestionably is a vital factor of productio
n.
\par <#/>In the light of the above it is obvious that after the IFL (Swedish Institute of Management) have completed their Contract, SICATA should necessarily proceed with the programme. <#/>For SICATA to be able to achieve this goal, inevitably we must activ
ely participate in all the two phases of each session of the CDP. <#/>Where we are subjected to constraints such as shortage of manpower and or funds; the shadow Board Meetings should be scheduled in such a way that enables the programme coordinator to at
t
end all the shadow board meetings. <#/>The reason for this being that at the end of CDP, the coordinator will be required to chair a Committee that will be encharged with the production of a hand-book to be used by SICATA. <#/>Guided by this, the followin
g has been decided:-
\par (i) Mr. <name/> - who is the Programme Coordinator should attend all the Board Meetings: Arusha, and Moshi (...).
\par <#/>(ii) Mr. <name/> who travelled to Moshi for the purpose of attending the Board meeting instead of Mr. <name/> is returning to Dar es Salaam to participate in the Women's Workshop to be held at our Branch Office on ..
\par <#/>The per diem given to <name/> has been deposited at the Project Head Office and will be given to Mr. <name/> for the same purpose on arrival. <#/>Twenty thousand five hundred only (..) have been deposited.
\par <#/>(iii) Since the Women's Workshop required three participants from our office, Mr. <name/> who leaves Moshi on ... should join you at the Workshop.
\par <#/>(iv) While at the workshop, you are to lead our team and Mr. <name/> will act as your secretary; he should submit the report at the time to be prescribed by you.
\par <#/>(v) During the first CDP session, only three SICATA officials attended the two phases 
of session I. <#/>For reasons advanced earlier in this letter and also through telephone conversation between myself and yourself; it is proposed that Mr. <name/> should be included in the programme. <#/>This will make the number of SICATA officials to be
 four, thus enabling us to cover every Workshop. <#/>Bearing this in mind, the proposed budget should take care of Mr.<name/> .
