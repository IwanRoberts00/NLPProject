\par <I> <h> Maxi: The smooth reggaeman </h>
\par }{\fs24 <#/>EVER since the unfortunate passing of reggae legend Bob Marley in 1981, the music scene has had a void unfilled which many <-/imposters> have tried to fill along the way. 
\par <#/>The roll-call of names is endless, however, good reggae music did come from acts like Ziggy Marley (of course), Steel Pulse, Third World Black Uhuru, Bunny Wailer and many others. 
\par <#/>Still the pop culture hadn't really <-/embranced> anyone as devoutly as Bob Marley, who was true roots and culture, promoting }{\i\fs24 rastafari}{\fs24  and calling for peace. 
\par However, in 1978, a couple of years before, while Bob was working his smash hit album "KAYA " London-born Max Priest began his career in music by joining Saxon International, one of London's notorious reggae sound systems. 
\par <#/>By 1980, the year island records released Marley's popular "}{\i\fs24 Uprising}{\fs24  " album, which included his hit "}{\i\fs24 Could You be Loved}{\fs24 ", Maxi and fellow saxon member Philip Levi collaborated on "}{\i\fs24 My God Me King}{\fs24 
", which became the first British reggae record to top the charts in Jamaica. 
\par <#/>From that point on, Max had his eyes on a solo career, which resulted in many singles until 1985, when he was signed to 10 records ( a British subsidiary of virgin records). 
\par <#/>His debut album for 10 records company "}{\i\fs24 You Are Safe}{\fs24 " (a compilation of those earlier singles), gave him the luxury of giving up his carpentry work to concentrate on his music career. 
\par <#/>By the time 1986's "}{\i\fs24 Intention}{\fs24 " was released, he was topping the British charts with "}{\i\fs24 Strollin'}{\fs24 ", "}{\i\fs24 Crazy}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Love}{\fs24 " }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24  "}{\i\fs24 Let Me Know", }{\fs24 
by this time he had amassed a huge underground following all over. 
\par <#/>Following were the "Maxi" album, with singles}{\i\fs24 ; "Some Guys Have All The Luck}{\fs24 " and the top 10 pop hit wild world", and touring throughout Eu
rope, Japan, Jamaica and the US with the likes of Sly & Robbie and the hot red toaster of the time, yellowman. 
\par <#/>Moving on the groundbreaking year of 1990, Maxi released his "}{\i\fs24 Bona Fide}{\fs24 " album on charisma records, his collaborative effort with Jazzie B. 
and Nellie Hooper, Geoffrey Chung, Sly Dunbar, Handel Tucker and Augustus "Gussie" Clark. <#/>The album's smash hit "}{\i\fs24 Close to you}{\fs24 ", went on to become the first reggae record to top the US pop charts and a top 5 <-/rythm> and blues hit. 

\par <#/>"That album allowed me to express different musical aspects,' from reggae to soul, when "}{\i\fs24 Close To You}{\fs24 
" took off, a lot of people who were not into reggae got into it. <#/>I felt that when it got to the top of the charts, everyone who had been such an important part in re
ggae - like Bob Marley -and many other pioneers - had created the pathway for that to happen," says Maxi. 
\par <#/>He had finally become a top player on the pop scene not only with his own album and single, but with the hugely popular urban smash hit "}{\i\fs24 Housecall}{\fs24 " (with shabba ranks) and "}{\i\fs24 Set The Night to Music}{\fs24 
" (his duet with Roberta Flack). <#/>Keeping his new high profile, his video played non-stop on MTV, bet and VHI, and he toured with the famous reggae sunsplash. 
\par <#/>Summing up his new popularity, and the near platinum success of "}{\i\fs24 Bona Fide}{\fs24 ", maxi priest }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>orth}{\fs24 
 concludes, "The Success of Bands Like soul II soul and U B40 played a big part in the reaction I got with that album. <#/>A lot of doors have been opened now we're not at the end of the road yet! <#/>"
\par It's now 1993, dancehall has begun to show signs of becoming the next huge music trend with the huge successes of Shabba Ranks, Supercat, Mad Cibra and the dance-hall-influenced music of top stars. 
\par <#/>Maxi in preparing his follow-up on "}{\i\fs24 Bonafide}{\fs24 ", realized that he wanted to tap into the vibe sustained by the "H}{\i\fs24 ousecall}{\fs24 
" production crew which included Dave Morales, Handel Tucker, Mickey Bennet and Sly Dunbar. <#/>Therefore he recruited the same team of players, along with Simon Law (of soul II soul fa
me), Gussi Clark, to produce his new set he chose to record in the YK., Jamaica, and US. 
\par <#/>The product of this global collaboration, "Fe Real", features ten new <-/sensous> and smooth <-/rythm> and blues <-/reggar>/pop tracks (nine co-written by maxi, }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>orth}{\fs24 ) and promises to keep up with the level of success maxi }{
\b\v\fs24 <&/>orth}{\fs24  is used to at this point in his career. 
\par <#/>"<-/Groovin> in the midnight", the smooth urban slanted first single, with background vocals by club siren gwen guthrie, is shaping up to be the first of a couple smashes to come. 
\par <#/>Of the album maxi }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>orth}{\fs24  states, "I think we covered all: ragamuffin, reggae, R&B, pop. }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>orth}{\fs24  this new album is meant to express all the different flavours. <#/>I know that my audience is wider now and my
 objective with this record is to a really appeal to a worldwide audience."
\par <#/>Soon-to-be smashes are the hypnotic dub <-/reggar> /R & B jam "sublime" the straight up <-/reggar> of "}{\i\fs24 Hard To Get}{\fs24 " and the smooth swing beat of "Can't turn Away". <#/>Stepping
 into the more traditional R & 8 <-/flovours>, he turns out the seductive, <-/rythmic> R & B of "One More chance", of which he explains, "I'm a just a sucker for those R & B songs. 
\par <#/>I think it has the old Marvin Gaye feel to it." 
\par <#/>Other things lined up to keep his profile high again include a tour which will include stops in the West Indies, Japan, Hong Kong, Guam and Hawaii, as well as his acting debut in the movie "scam" (starring Christopher Walken). 
\par <#/>However, keeping his mind focused on his 
music, he clarifies, "This album is just as important to me as when I first came to business. <#/>In a way, it reminds me of when I did my first LP. <#/>I feel like we've got the same kind of freshness. <#/>Yeah man, with this album I'm in gear!"
\par <#/>Looks like reggae music fans have found their new man ... </I>

\par }{\b\fs24 <I> <h> The death of Bruce Lee's son </h>
\par }{\fs24 <#/>"The crow" was to be Brandon Lee's breakthrough film. <#/>After three martial art movies this one was destined to make him a big star. 
\par <#/>In it he played Eric Draven, a rock star who returned from the grave to avenge his own murder and although the filming had been held up <-_a><+_and> dogged by bad luck, the movie's backers were already confident that they
 had a smash hit on their hands. 
\par <#/>But with only a few more days' shooting left, tragedy struck. 
\par <#/>Shortly after midnight on March 31, Brandon stepped in front of the cameras to film a simple scene to be edited in at the beginning of the movie, where a drug dealer shoots down Eric Draven. 
\par <#/><-/Actro> Michael Massee, who plays his killer, funboy, was supposed to fire a 44 calibre revolver at Brandon as he walked through his apartment door carrying a bag of groceries. 
\par <#/>The bag contained a very sm
all explosive device - known as a squib- which was to detonate when the gun, filled with blanks, went off. <#/>But something went catastrophically wrong. <#/>Brandon slumped to the floor with blood pouring from a wound in his stomach. 
\par <#/>It was perhaps 30 seconds before anybody realised that Brandon wasn't acting anymore. 
\par <#/>An ambulance sped him from the set in Wilmington, North Carolina, to the New Hanover Regional Medical Centre and he was rushed into surgery. <#/>The operating specialist, Dr. McMurray, spent five hours trying to stop the bleeding, but in vain. 
\par <#/>Such were his injuries, that at 1.04 p.m. on Wednesday, March 31 Brandon Lee was declared dead. 
\par <#/>The first press reports appeared next morning, with details sketchy at first; in one newspaper his death was blamed on an explosive device that they claimed had been concealed beneath his shirt which had somehow blasted shrapnel into his abdomen. 

\par <#/>Another newspaper <-_advance><+_advanced> the theory that the blanks in the gun had been replaced with real bullets. <#/>Hollywood was in a state of shock. 
\par <#/>Kiefer Sutherland was reported as saying, "I want to know what a real bullet was doing in that gun. <#/>I cannot believe his death was an accident." 
\par <#/>But one aspect of the tragedy that nobody could ignore was the links between Brandon's death and that of his father Bruce Lee, who died aged 32 - when Brandon was eight. 
\par <#/>Like father like son: they both died young, they were both on the verge of fame (Bruce Lee's big\-gest film, "Ente
r the Dragon" was released a year after his death) and their deaths were both shrouded in mystery (the official reason for Bruce's death was brain disease, but <-_its'><+_it\rquote s> something fans have always doubted). 
\par <#/>Chillingly, in the last movie Bruce Lee ever made (called game of death), he played an actor who is shot dead. <#/>On a movie set. <#/>After someone substituted a live bullet from a dummy round... 
\par <#/>Was there a Lee family curse - bad "Fung Che" as it\rquote s known in Hong Kong? <#/>Brandon himse
lf is said to have believed so. <#/>A friend recalls Brandon's "premonition that he would die, suddenly, on a movie set. <#/>" But Rob Cohen, who spent four years researching the life of Bruce Lee before writing and directing "Dragon: the Bruce Lee story 
(to be released soon), has more down-to-earth explanation:
\par \rdblquote I do believe in a sense of fate but I don't believe that Brandon and Bruce were fated to die young. <#/>Bruce Lee had a brain problem - he fell into a 24-hour coma three months before his death - a
nd many brain problems cannot be detected before they happen. 
\par <#/>\rdblquote As for Brandon Lee, he was killed in an accident on a movie set". 
\par <#/>Dragon would be dedicated to the memory of Brandon who, in another ironic twist, turned down the chance of appearing in the film, for fear of the demons he believed killed his father. 
\par <#/>If nothing else "the <-/cow>" certainly seems to have been cursed. <#/>Since the start of the filming on February 1, the film had been plagued with bad luck. 
\par <#/><-/Bizzare> accidents
 included 27-year-old carpenter Jim Martishius being severely burned by a live power <-/like> that hit his crane; a lorry used in the film mysteriously catching fire; a construction worker putting a screwdriver through his head; and a <-/strom> on March 1
3 destroying most of the outdoor set. 
\par <#/>The day before Brandon died entertainment weekly magazine in America carried an article on the "Curse of the crow". <#/>Production co-ordinator, Jennifer Roth, insisted the film was not jinxed. <#/>"We have a lot o
f stunts and effects, and I've been on productions before where people died." 
\par <#/>So what did happen? <#/>The ballistics report released in America seems to point to a terrible accident. <#/>The gun used in the scene - a real .44 magnum, not a replica - w
as used just before Brandon's death in another scene which required a close up of the gun being loaded with bullets. 
\par <#/>These dummy bullets (metal cases with no gunpowder) were removed straight afterwards. <#/>Wilmington police detectives said when the gun was unloaded one of the tips from the dummy bullet detached itself and was left in the chamber. 
\par <#/>"For the shooting scene, the same gun was loaded with blanks, which used the gunpowder of a real bullet, but with no metal tip. <#/>It seems the reaction led to the deadly creation of a live bullet." 
\par <#/>Brandon was buried next to his father in a Seattle cemetery. <#/>At the Hollywood Hills memorial the next day, Sunday, April 4, family friend and "under siege" star Steven Seagal, who had known Brandon since he was five, was both sad and angry. 

\par <#/>"Something is terribly wrong here," said Seagal. <#/>" Either somebody tried to murder him or there's some kind of gross negligence. <#/>I've been asked to get involved in the investigation. <#/>I'd like to because we all cared for him very much"

\par Other stars paying their respects included Kiefer Sutherland - whose production company Billwater, employed Brandon's fiancee Lisa Hutton - Lou Diamond Phillips and David Hasselhof. 
\par <#/>Michael Berryman, the 44-year-old actor playing opposite Brandon in "The crow", said: Brandon put everything into his role. <#/>There are moments that show his heart and his soul. <#/>The scene haven't filmed }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 are going to <-_he><+_be> hard to film without him, but I would be proud to do it for his memory." 
\par <#/>Although the film was halted immediately, it is likely "the Crow" will eventually be released as an epitaph to a promising career cut tragically short. </I>

\par }{\fs24 <#/>WHEN the British in Tanganyika were packing up in 1961 because one 39-year-old brilliant chap called Nyerere had bought air tickets for them all, one very valuable possession the British came with in the earl
y 1920s didn't quite fit into their crammed suitcases. 
\par <#/>They had to leave the sprawling possession behind and asked us to use it if we so wished. <#/>We took it and used it - the English language. 
\par <#/>But unlike in many places in Africa, the Westminst
er language didn't walk about so proudly and confidently from Bukoba to Mtwara or Dar es Salaam to Kigoma. <#/>A healthy and handsome young language born in Tanzania was muscular enough to kick the blushing foreign language out of its sight. 
\par <#/>English galloped and bid itself in classrooms, books and offices and ventures out timidly, rarely, as an occasional for those who had seen \lquote many blackboards'. 
\par <#/>English blushed more soon after the British had landed at Heathrow Airport and docked at Southampton 
Harbour, when Kiswahili was declared the National language. <#/>The real, big language coup came when Kiswahili became the official language. <#/>Things were hot for English and it slunk out of many offices trembling. 
\par <#/>Had it not been for the importance of the hand\-
shakes in International Relations and Goodwill, and the desire to acquire science and technology, Tanzania would have promptly wrapped the language neatly in a huge package and post it to Buckingham Palace with suitable diplomatic compliments
 in a covering letter. 
\par <#/>So English language was given an encouraging don't-worry-boy pat on the back, plus a furtive wink - which, English fortunately didn't see - and allowed in primary schools first as both the medium of instruction and subject but s
hortly after as subject only. <#/>Now Kiswahili is roaring loud and clear in primary schools from Mathematics to Geography. 
\par <#/>From secondary schools upwards English has been given a kingly status. <#/>It is both the language of instruction and a subject. <#/>This is where the bottleneck of our language policy lies. 
\par <#/>From primary schools the energetic young boys and girls cross over to secondary schools with all basic concepts firmly framed in technical Kiswahili. <#/>In Mathematics for example, they sing of }{\i\fs24 '}{\fs24 <ea/>}{\i\fs24 kipenyo '}{\fs24 , }{
\i\fs24 '}{\fs24 <ea/>}{\i\fs24 nusu-kipenyo'}{\fs24 , }{\i\fs24 '}{\fs24 <ea/>}{\i\fs24 nyuzi'}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 '}{\fs24 <ea/>}{\i\fs24 mzingo'}{\fs24  and many other technical terms in this and other subjects. 
\par <#/>Suddenly after toying with these words for more than five years they are confronted with strange words like radius, diameter, angle and a multitude of gibberish terms in all other subjects. 
\par <#/>At an age when he should be consolidating concepts he learned in primary school, a secondary school student in Form I has a new task or pronouncing and conceptualizing strange terms in English language. 
\par <#/>Before he extricates himself from this confusion, the fourth year is in and he has to sit for an examination. <#/>He walks into the examination room to fail. <#/>Mathematics, the gateway to technology, has been leading in failur
es - at least according to complaints from the National Examinations Council. 
\par <#/>In fact in secondary schools, there is a tendency among students to give science and technical subjects like chemistry, physics and mathematics a wide berth because they sou
nd so foreign even though chemistry, physics and Maths are all around him every day for twenty four hours. 
\par <#/>Something big ought to be done in the language policy of our educational institutions if we want to manufacture our own Tan\-zanian made chemicals for making rocks change into water or a hydromagnate which, when placed on the ground, can make under\-
ground water come to the surface. 
\par <#/>Other countries are leaping forward in technology because there are no two colours in the language used in their educational system. 
\par <#/>The up-rooting and replanting of the English language tree naturally stopped the growth of deep roots. <#/>This is glaringly evident around us. <#/>A kindergarten kid can easily count the number of Tanzanian authors of English book
s. <#/>But for other countries especially in West Africa you need an electronic calculator to take stock of them all. 
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24 <#/>Stop any Standard Seven pupil and ask him in English: "What is your name?" The answer he will give you is likely hit in the humou
r books. When this pupil goes to a secondary school as we saw above, and we expect him to understand Abbot or <-/Durell> or Achebe and Ngugi, we are only asking for the impossible, and we get the possible - failure.
\par In public life, fractured, limping Engli
sh can be seen screaming painfully and nobody cares. In one bus, under a box with a Red Cross, a misspelling is printed in red: <-/FRIST> AID. To the busdriver the conductor and presumably the owner of the bus, the two words could just as well be pidgin J
apanese. A sign on a big shop <-_boats><+_boasts> with ignorance: NEW <-/ORIGIONAL>.
\par In a bar, against a blue arrow pointing to the lavatory, a mis-spelling makes one chuckle with unintended humour. TO LET is printed instead of TOILET. The health inspector

\par <I> <h> Rosa Mistika revisited with a gender perspective </h>
\par }{\fs24 <#/>THE Swahili novel, beginning from its very inception in the first h
alf of this century, has toed the line of world tradition - stereotyping the woman as the 'victim' of man in his many exploits, ranging from love and sex, to prejudice, <-_phillistinism><+_philistinism> and sadism. <#/>The woman has been portrayed in the 
unenviable position of being the docile recipient of man's manifestations of emotional and physical release. 
\par <#/>Sometimes this docility has been interpreted as or even transformed (by the writers) to be the natural state and place of the "fair sex". <#/>T
he unfairness and abnormality of this phenomenon has passed either unnoticed or been deliberately ignored. <#/>But the advent of feminism and the subsequent introduction of gender studies in institutions of learning has drastically altered the picture. <#
/>Gender sensitivity has literally engulfed every <-_face><+_phase> of our life; be it in the classroom or in politics or in daily social intercourse. 
\par <#/>The ramifications of this 'gender sensitiveness' are many and far reaching. <#/>The thesis of this pa
per is this: that gender sensitivity (or over-sensitivity)has so overwhelmed us by its revolutionary rhetoric and practice that, instead of seeing more in the ability of women to face her world, we have actually seemed to see less. <#/>Our vision has been
 blinded by the brilliant rays of the new days. <#/>For instance, any novel that does not praise the woman directly as the equal of the man, is a reactionary work of art. 
\par <#/>I would like, at the outset, to exclude the pornographic novels that populate the
 streets of Dar es Salaam from any examination of the Swahili novel. <#/>These works <-/offiction>, are modelled after what western scholarship calls "popular literature". <#/>But a more appropriate name for what we have in Tanzania, would be "street lite
rature" thus emphasizing both the psychology of its production and the nests of its actors and consumers. 
\par <#/>By over-exposing and overemphasizing the lust and nakedness of their heroes and heroines (if such they can be called) the writers have transgresse
d against good literary sense that could have made the novels stand the test of time. <#/>Instead, they have ministered to the superficial and transient fancies of a negligible segment of the urban population. <#/>Literature as one writer once said, is wr
iting which society will not willingly let die. <#/><-_Consequentially><+_Consequently> novels such as Shemeji kula, Dada yuko kazini and others in similar vein fall short of the intent of serious literature. 
\par <#/>In line with this proposition I would like 
to make an inept examination of one Swahili novel which has become a classic of contemporary fiction in Tanzania. <#/>It is Kezilahabi's Rosa Mistika. <#/>Our purpose is to show that in addition to portraying women as victims of conservative traditions an
d customs authored by men in the latter's favour, the novel shows the moral and spiritual superiority of women over men. <#/>It is therefore simplistic to argue that Rosa Mistika is a victim }{\i\fs24 per se}{\fs24 
 of the environment in which she operates. <#/>It would be m
ore prudent and fruitful to see her reaction to "victimization" and the hands of a phallic world as <-_representating><+_representing> the germ of a rebellion against an unjust order. <#/>Let us see how this works in the novel. <#/>Rosa Mistika, in the no
vel that takes after her name, is a girl "more sinned against than sinning". <#/>At least that is what she believes even as she commits the most shameful of moral "transgressions". 
\par <#/>The novel, Rosa Mistika, opens with a poignant depiction of the cruel r
ule of phallic power. <#/>Zakaria, the father is a <-_vainglori-joker><+_vainglorious joker> as well as a child abuser, by contemporary social morality. <#/>On top of it all, he is a wife-beater. <#/>Zakaria is the embodiment of all that modern sensibilit
y, with its hypocritical obsession with equality and justice, abhors. 
\par <#/>As the novel opens, we see him manhandling Rose, beating her until she bleeds and dangling her by her throat until she nearly chokes to death. <#/>Reason? <#/>She has received a love
 letter from a boy in her class. <#/>As it turns out, it is more of a well-wisher than a love letter. <#/>But for Zakaria, there is no difference. <#/>All his daughters - Rose, Stella, Honorata, Sperantia and Flora - live in mortal fear of the man. <#/>So
 does their mother. <#/>And "Maji-Machafu", as Zakaria is nick-named in the village, brags incessantly for being able to keep his daughters in "their place". 
\par <#/>Our interest in this paper is not so much in the cruelty and sadism of this drunken parent, but in the psychological formation which it engenders in his five daughters, specifically the eldest, Rosa. 
\par <#/>Zakaria's inhumanity is not to be taken for granted. <#/>The narrator belabours and editorializes on Zakaria's character with relentless fury. <#
/>At one stage, within a space of three pages the novel comments on the man's cruelty no less than three times. 
\par <X}{\v\fs24 _><#/><ea_>"Rosa alinyanf'anywa shuka Chupi ilimwokoa lakini matiti yalikuwa nje. Ole wao watakaoyaona matitiya bintizao<ea/>!" (my emphasis):

\par <#/>Woo betide those who will eye the breasts of their daughters!)
\par <#/>Then, referring to the neighbours who had gathered to witness Zakaria's vengeful cruelty on his daughter, the narrator tells us:
\par "<ea_><X_>}{\v\fs24 Wakiwa katika shuka zao nyeupe, walionekana kama malaika waliotumwa kuja kushuhudia ukatili uliokuwa ukitendeka; siyo tu kati ya mwanadamu na mwanadamu, lakini pia katiya baba na bintiye}{\fs24 </X><ea/>."

\par <#/>Here humanity's dignity has been violated. <#/>Both the sinner and the sinned against suffer an ignominious shame when the sanctity of a daughter's privacy is ravished.

 reduced to a gaping student of Cupid. <#/>The novelist sums up his state as follows:

\par <#/>In front of her, this giant of a man she had vanquished stood still, bloodless. <#/>His blood had coagulated.)
\par <#/>Transfixed to the spot, unable to fathom or comprehend the genesis of intent of this fury, Zakaria can only manage to stammer:

\par <#/>The fallacy of phallic power and the legitimacy of parental tyranny have been exposed and challeng

\par <#/>Rosa disowned as daughter, and rejected in love, subsequently commits suicide; the father is speared to death; while Regina dies from shock. 
\par <#/>When the three members of this tragic family lie dead at the end of the novel our hearts bleed for the innocent wife and mother. <#/>Throughout the novel, Regina has been portrayed as the docile wife and loving mother. 
\par <#/>Only once does she lift her tongue to contradict her husband, even then mildly. <#/>And only after she has given birth to a son, thus breaking the monotonous and, according to tradition, unwanted string of female children. <#/>Five of them! 
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24 <#/>Zakaria's joy and Regina's new assertive self is revealed in the following conversation:
\par <ea_>"Regina! Sasa mji ni wako."

\par (Regina, this is now your homestead".
\par "Thanks," Regina answered with a smile.
\par She now felt she had the strength to speak.
\par "Zakaria, it is better if you stop drinking".
\par "Ah my wife, do you think drunkenness is illness?)
\par But the new woman insists: "<ea_>Lakini Zakaria inafaa upunguze ulevi. Wengine wanakunywa lakini bado wanaweza kutunza watoto wao vizurina hao wenyewe wanafanya kazi nyumbani<ea/>."
\par "But you must cut back on drink:
\par Other people drink, but they still take good care of their children and they also participate in the chores at home."
\par It is the first time she has ever uttered such words. Caught unprepared by this new offensive from his wife, Zakaria changes the subject t
o avert direct defeat. The oppressive hand of tradition which plays up baby-boys and despises girls and punishes the mothers has been lifted from this woman's head forever.
\par This very tradition which discriminates against baby-girls is quick to grab the older girls for 'sale' to the highest bidder or to one dear to the parents. That is Zakaria's dream; a dream he will never see materialize.
\par The strain of pain and rebellion in his daughters is too strong to allow him to reap wealth and happiness where he had 
sowed spiritual poverty and misery. Rose commits suicide as a protest against his fiancee. Charles, the hunter of virgins who, having failed in his mission, ends up in a monastery as a lay brother. He realizes too late that Rose loved him truly in spite o
f her immoral past.
\par Charles' selfish mission in life (to marry a virgin) and his subsequent failure constitute another blow to the arrogance of phallic hegemony.
\par The dramatic and, almost <-_parabolical><+_parabolic>, ending of the novel widens the area of p
hallic authority to include its lust for inheritable wealth. Zakaria's male relatives grab everything they can lay their hands on, leaving the children destitute and unprotected.
\par During the wake, as the three bodies lie freshly buried in the garden, the relatives turn to Regina's cows and transform the occasion into a feast.
\par }{\fs24 ...<ea_>}{\v\fs24 Ng'ombe walichinjwa. Kila siku mmoja.

\par Although mourning is usually only three days, people stayed on for the fourth day when the last 
cow was slaughtered ... When there was no more meat, they began to disperse. Some didn't even say goodbye. Some relatives of the deceased stayed behind to get their share of inheritance ...)
\par Rosa Mistika as a novel, challenges perceived ideas. If Rosa rebe
lled against her father's totalitarian rule, her younger sister, Flora, defies the entire institution of commercialised marriages. After they have divided up Zakaria and Regina's property, ranging from household items to the oranges and banana plants in t
he backyard, they also demand that John, Flora's fiancee, pay the bride price immediately although John has just offered to take care of the orphaned children whom none of the relatives will take. Flora tells them to "forget" about the dowry.
\par <ea_>John hatatoa hata chapa kwa ajili yenu.
\par Kuwatunza wadogo wanguhakuna mahari ipitayo hiyo<ea/>.
\par (John will not pay a penny to you. Taking care of my younger brother and sisters - what dowry beats such a gesture).
\par Clearly, Rosa Mistika is a subversive text; but not in the way it deals with sexuality alone. It is more subversive in the way it uses sexuality to overturn the structures of tyrannical tradition.
\par After witnessing Rosa and Flora defy the oppressive machinery at work, we cannot but sense the dawning of a new sensibility - a new sensibility gender relations.
\par What happens to the women in Rosa Mistika is, to a large extent, reflective of what is to be found in most Swahili novels of the last twenty five years. The novelists have been relentless in their portrayal
 of women under the thumb of a male-dominated world.
\par What we as readers and critics need to do, is to unearth these women's resilience and iconoclasm. Such has been the project of this short review.}{\fs24  </X></I>}{\v\fs24

\par <I> <h> 'If music be the food of life, play on' </h>
\par }{\fs24 <#/>This week our music affairs correspondent Masoud Masoud explores another aspect of African music. <#/>He outlines <-_it's><+_its> traditional significance and its melodic content, as it forge
s ahead to challenge <-_it's><+_its> western counterparts towards the twentieth century. 
\par <#/>TO say that music is part of life in Africa is an understatement. <#/>In many African cultures music has a greater significance than human life. <#/>It is often b
elieved to have predated the existence of man and remains the main conduit for <-/commiunications> with the gods, it certainly pre-dates history. <#/>Even the young pop <-_musicians><+_musician> who has never played traditional music and likes to dance to
 
American soul, funk or hip-hop carries a <-/wheight> of cultural baggage, memories from the collective sub-<-/concious> and the <-/concious> expression of his people, and understanding music's potential, will be part of the load. <#/>In that baggage, the 
African musician has a complete survival kit, a fund of forms and contents, but it is also a burden to be carried through life. <#/>From the African perspective music is <-/doubtlessly> heavy with lots and lots of meaning. 
\par <#/><h> Music as a language </h>
\par <#/>Music was probably a language some time before words had literal meanings. <#/>Music is so much a part of mortal life <-_than><+_that> no major African language has a word for music in general, and the various forms it takes. 
\par <#/>There are countless w
ords for indigenous musical styles, dances and songs most of which either describe the music's function, the instrument it is played on, or the <-/occassion> on which it is used. <#/>But for most purposes the catch-all European word 'music' (<foreign/>}{
\i\fs24 musique}{\fs24 , <ea/>}{\i\fs24 muziki}{\fs24 ) is now used throughout the African continent. 
\par <#/>Africa is a land of languages. <#/>There are at least 2,000 ethnic sub-groups speaking as many dialects of the main language families. <#/>Their customs, traditions and beliefs vary widel
y, despite similarities in the way of life and social organisations across the continent. <#/>The main language groups are the Bantu speaking people of the Central and Southern Africa, the Nilo-Sahara north-eastern region, and the Niger Congo language spe
akers of West Africa. 
\par <#/>Within these, whole nations of inter-related peoples have developed and several empires have been established by the major 'tribes' whose names should be on every school child's roll call of African dynasties, including the Kingdo
m of the Ashantis, the Manding Kingdom and the Zulu Nation. 
\par <#/>And if one could afford a little patriotism, then he can't help }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  having at least heard the Milambo, Mkwawa, Marealle, Sina, Majebelle, Kinjeketile and the Ruhunda dynasties on main
land Tanzania. <#/>Each sub-group, 'tribe' or clan of the main groups has <-_it's><+_its> own music, most of which has a specific function in the community. 
\par <#/>This applies not only to 'folklore' or 'cultural' music but also to transitional, modernised variants and outright commercial dance music. 
\par <#/><h> The original instrument </h>
\par <#/>The voice is the original music instrument and it is no <-/concidence> that singing is still the most important feature in almost all forms of popular music, but the hum
an body was also adaptable as a hand-clapping, leg-slapping, and 'human beat-box' instrument thousands of years before being taken up by the 20th century hip-hoppers. 
\par <#/>With the beginnings of language came the lyric, crucial to most traditional music wh
ere the message is usually served by the medium. <#/>Within small ethnic sub-groups traditions are preserved through the continuity of music, but songs that are handed down are prone to changes in content and interpretation. <#/>In popular music designed 
to reach <-/otside> a small community, songs must still be relevant to the primary audience. 
\par <#/>Topicality, poetic or oratorial elegance and wit are the essential ingredients and hall-mark talents for the social commentator. <#/>But the measure of success
 for a popular musician is being accepted and enjoyed by people who at times don't necessarily understand the message. 
\par <#/>And no matter what the language, African listeners have an ear for music; wasn't it William Shakespeare again who said 'Music itself is an international language'? 
\par }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24 <h> The vocal construction </h>
\par <#/>An important vocal construction is the call-and-response singing, a pattern common to most types of African music and even Black music in the West. <#/>This form of musical dialogue u
sually consists of a short phrase from the lead voice or instrument answered by the chorus or other instruments and so it progresses, exchanging words or musical phrases in a kind of short-hand abstract conversation, although literal meaning is never far 
away. 
\par <#/>Even purely instrumental African music sometimes has a narrative story-line behind it. <#/>In Tanzania, with the Nyamwezi (My own tribe), for example, certain xylophone tunes have unspoken lyrics which must be learned in order to play the pieces 
properly. 
\par <#/>And in contemporary African pop, bass and guitar lines usually follow the melodic pattern of the songs. 
\par <#/>Melody has often been identified by musicologists as less important in African music than rhythm and harmony, but the interplay and 'impersonation' between melody and rhythm is one of African music's powerful fascinations. 
\par <#/>Melodic instruments and vocal lines are as dependent on rhythm pulse as the so called rhythm or percussion which invariably manage to create a kind of <-/parral
el> melody of their own. <#/>In contemporary pop, the song content does not always dictate the form of the music. 
\par <#/>For example, unlike the Swahili language, the important music language of Lingala, is so tonal but accents are often bent in favour of a tuneful line, which may be stretched with added syllables to fit the melody. 
\par }\pard\plain \s17\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 <#/>Some languages are so tonal that the sequence of notes played on certain instruments can have a literal meaning. 
\par \pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang2057 {\fs24 <#/>An obvious example is the talking drum, but even guitar 
and saxophone phrases have been 'interpreted' by music fanatics as subtle threats, insults or veiled warnings to rival musicians. <#/>When the African's love of word-play is taken into account these meanings can be stretched indefinitely. 
\par <#/>Making witty, topical puns with secret, 'in-crowd' significance can be fun enough with words; when sounds are used the scope is even greater. <#/>And it is this scope and level that has encompassed the African with music for each aspect of his life. 

\par <#/>In short for an African, as Shakespeare says, music is the food of life, so we might as well keep playing on.

\par }{\b\fs24 <I> <h> The use of language in music </h>
\par }{\fs24 <#/>The que
st for the meaning of various aspects of African music has taken centre stage for many Africanists from the humanities to social sciences. <#/>In this specific field of study, ethnomusicology, new trends of inquiry focus on the interplay of various elemen
ts in music creativity. <#/>Our music affairs correspondent Masoud Masoud explains why language plays a significant role in its organisation. 
\par <#/>CONTRARY to what many people earlier believed, language is of paramount importance to any given music form. <#
/>One of its prime objectives is to reveal the meaning of a musical practice by looking at the extent to which the cultural fabric is reflected in the creative music process of a given community. 
\par <#/>This implies an improvisational creative process in music, which in African art, is an attainment in itself. 
\par <#/>It exists as a process of <AmE/>fulfillment during the creation, and ceases to exists in its completion. <#/>This <-/phenomenom> is found in a variety of African music cultures. 
\par <#/><h> Distinctions </h>
\par <#/>Nevertheless, distinctions should be made between each category of musical composition. <#/>A different set of forms and norms, for example, may apply to compositions that have a social or religious context, and where the ritual demands more <-
/rigourous> and <-/faithfull> reproduction. 
\par <#/>In this case, a musical composition or dance exists in perpetuity, and does not necessarily become a past referential frame work for a new creative experience. 
\par <#/>In spite of the large amount of professional literature in the West, devoted to explaining the nature of African music, its meaning and governing principle continue to challenge casual contemporary music scholars. 
\par <#/>Westerners have preferred to simplify it by <-/assesing> the art itself outside the cultural context, and refuse to accept that the creative process of African music is governed by principles different from those prevailing in Europe or America. 

\par <#/>In this article, I put forward two propositions: First, that the creative process in
 African vocal music is contained in different levels of <-_it's><+_its> languages in the New World which has rendered the basic music elements vulnerable to modification or replacement by others based on different principles of organisation. 
\par <#/>In other words, the creative process is culturally defined, inspired by a variety of practices peculiar to a particular ethnic group. 
\par <#/>Well, to anyone not well-versed in technical music construction, this may sound a little too cumbersome or perhaps academically esoteric. 
\par <#/>To understand this concept, I think it is appropriate that I give you a detailed linguistic analysis to this realisation. 
\par <#/><h> Why language is so crucial </h>
\par <#/>An examination of vocal music in Africa reveals that language <-_play><
+_plays> a pivotal role in its structurization. <#/>Language is a vehicle par excellence for conveying the African philosophy of existence which simply goes thus: "I belong, therefore I am", which is crucial to the understanding of the creative process in
volved. 
\par <#/>Tonal inflections play a vital role in the process of melodic construction. <#/>African languages are predominantly tonal, though some aren't as tonal as others. <#/>In that, the meaning of each word is determined by the pattern of <-_it's><+_i
ts> tonal inflections. 
\par <#/>Take for example the two sets of words; <ea/>mo'ko'lo and <ea/>moko'lo in Lingala or <ea/>bara'bara! <#/>and <ea/>barabara in our very own Swahili language. 
\par <#/>Both of these sets of words have the same spelling and only differ from each other when various tonal levels are applied to their syllables. 
\par <#/>Semantically, the first Lingala word means 'a day', while the second means 'an elder', similarly the first Swahili word is an exclamation 'exactly!', while the second simply means 'a road' or 'a path'. 
\par <#/>The use of any other tonal sequence changes the meaning of the words or renders them meaningless. <#/>Clearly, tonal inflections play a vital role in the process of melodic construction. 
\par <#/>To maintain meaning, the basic melodic patterns should have directions, but not necessarily should have specific sizes of their intervals. 
\par <#/>They must comply with the tonal requirements of each word. <#/>The final melodic contour is left to the creativity of the composer who determines the range of the intervals. 
\par <#/><h> <-/Parrallel> harmony </h>
\par <#/>When the <-_directions><+_direction> of the intervals in a melodic process is governed by the rules of the language, it follows that this must apply to all vocal lines being sung simultan
eously on different pitch levels, the result is parallel harmony, something very common in African vocal tradition. 
\par <#/>Until recently, most non-Africans misunderstood the logic of this, choosing instead to characterise African <-/parrallel> harmony as the equivalent of the embryonic phase in the evolution of Western harmony. 
\par <#/>In fact, while <-/parrallel> harmony is found in most cultures, each ethnic group has its own distinctive style. <#/>Each is unique because it is ethnically and linguistically defined. 
\par <#/>The organisation of African rhythms is governed by different principles, most of which are linguistically derived. <#/>In vocal music, like the East African 'Taarab' for instance, the poetical rhythm is important. 
\par <#/>In words with more than just one syllable in African languages, the stress is often placed on the syllables preceding a semi-consonant (l, m, n, s, w, y). 
\par <#/>Thus, for example, with the Swahili language verb '<ea/>kupenda', to love, the stress is placed on the second syllable 'pe' which is elongated, as a result of the anticipated <-/pronounciation> of the third syllable 'nda'. 
\par <#/>This feature is obviously reflected in vocal music although the overall melodic rhythm is left to the <-_composers><+_composer's> artistic discretion. 
\par <#/>The impact of the language is felt as well in the instrumental rhythmic structures. 
\par <#/>Often, a phrase or series of 'non-sense' syllables is formulated to an instrumental rhythmic pattern known as the time-line pattern, serving as a memory and teaching aid. 
\par <#/>In a composition, these time-line patterns function as a measuring stick for musical phrases. 
\par <#/>Each individual pattern may appear simple but the difficulty in understanding the final rhythmic tapestry of the piece stems from the relationship created by their combinations. 
\par <#/>This interlocking relationship results in a melodic formula; a section of the composition in which all time-line patterns are recycled, before reaching a new starting point. <#/>This aspect is called the 'Ensemble Thematic Cycle' in music study. 

\par <#/>Although an ensemble thematic cycle is rhythmically conceived, it also engenders the melodic and harmonic dimensions of the compositions. 
\par <#/>In a properly <-/fullfilled> cycle, the relationship of time-line patterns, as rendered by differently pitched percussive instruments, produces well-defined melodic lines and }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24  tapestry of harmonic sound. 
\par <#/>This level of creativity is not easy to define. <#/>In Africa, the point is illustrated by a musician's ability to explain 'why' but not 'how' he composes, as is the case in Europe or America.

-man war campaign against his own government. <#/>Alone among the giants of African music, Fela Kuti has always made use of his time in the spotlight to amplify the radical views he espouses. 
\par <#/>Unlike other African superstars, Fela has always made his compositions confrontational, dealing with injustice, corruption and brutality. 
\par <#/><h> Pidgin English </h>
\par <#/>His use of pidgin English has made his songs accessible to a wider international audience, while his crusade on behalf of the 'ordinary' Africans has given him heroic status among Blacks throughout the world. 
\par <#/>As an innovator of Afro-beat in the late '60s, Fela has established a popular base. 
\par <#/>He was a musical pioneer, inventor of the big-band sound which incorporated massed saxophones and trumpets, and choral arrangements based on call and response patterns. 
\par <#/>Then there was the pulsating dance rhythm and stinging anti-establishment lyrics }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 . 
\par <#/>Fela has seen much of the African dilemma, from colonialism through independence, civil war, and bureaucratic corruption to military coups. 
\par <#/>And these are subjects about which he has sung since the early '70s. <X_>}{\v\fs24 <#/>Among the best known titles among his over 50 album releases is Gentleman, in which Fela breaks loose, saying: "I 
no be gentleman at all - o / I be African man original..." Others include Expensive shit, ITT (short for International Thief Thief), Black President, Confusion, Sorrow Tears, Zombie, Blood Vagabonds in Power and Teacher Don't Teach Me Nonsense.}{\fs24 
</X>
\par <#/>With Fela's music age, most modern-day Tanzanian youth won't be able to recall the mighty big-band sound or the fiery rhetoric behind his driving Afro vibes. <#/>But for the most up-dated ones, songs like African }{\i\fs24 Woman}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 
Shakara}{\fs24  won't be hard to recall. 
\par <#/><h> Between the lines</h> 
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24 <#/>In the former, Fela sings: "If you call a woman, African woman no go agree / She go say, I no be woman / She go say she equal to man. She go say she got power like man / She go say anything man do she self fit do / She 
go want take cigar before anybody / She go want you open door for am / She go want make man wash plate for her for kitchen / She go want reach down for food ... for meat before anybody / Call }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>slang}{\v\fs24 
 um for dance she go dance lady dance ...}{\fs24 </X>
\par <#/>In 1986, Fela was released from the notorious Kirikiri prison after serving part of a five-year sentence imposed on him for allegedly trying to export some US $1,600 while on his way to play in America. 
\par <#/>Once free, he caused an uproar by claiming that the trial judge had apologised to him for having imposed a politically motivated sentence. 
\par <#/>At a post-release press conference, the ever-provocative Fela announced he would be running for presidency when free elections were held. 
\par <#/>Espousing a doctrine of African 'Humanism', he outlined his method of defeating militarism. <#/>He was once quoted as saying: "Give everyone a weapon and a rank, then everyone is a soldier." 
\par <#/>While he was in prison, the Egypt 80 band had been kept ticking over by his son Femi, who also plays saxophone like a reflection of his father. 
\par <#/>Understandably Femi was both proud and resentful of the association and strove to create a personal expression of Afro-beat. <#/>As a result of this, he easily found an appreciable audience in France. 
\par <#/>During the enforced lull in Fela's career, it was refreshing to hear a burst <-_or><+_of> crisp Afrobeat coming from all different sources. 
\par <#/>For all the sympathy and outrage expressed for Fela in his time of detention, his music had lost <-_it's><+_its> percussive edge during the mid 80s. 
\par <#/>And it was not just his injuries that had weakened his music, part of the problem was that Fela did not have Tony Allen drumming for him anymore. 
\par <#/>Allen, a very energetic perfectionist, with an output that is almost prolific, had opted to record his own work in London and in the process left Fela high and dry. 
\par <#/>Fela was born in Abeokuta, Nigeria in 1938, to a well respected Yomba family. <#/>His father, The Reverend I. O. Ransome Kuti, was a composer and influential preacher, like his father before him who had been a pioneer of the Yomba Christian Church. 

\par <#/>His mother Fummilayu, was a key figure in the nationalistic struggle. <#/>A confidante of Kwame Nkrumah, she met Mao Tse Tung in China and won a Lenin Peace Prize. 
\par <#/>Both Fela's family were anti-colonial, but Fela became even more so. 
\par <#/>A rebel from an early age, Fela refused to study law or medicine like his brothers, one of <-_who><+_whom>, Olikoye, went to become Minister of Health in Babangida's government. 
\par <#/><h> High-life jazz </h>
\par <#/>He later made his way to Trinity College of Music in London, where he studied composition and trumpet. <#/>After four years in London, he returned to Nigeria and formed his first group, Koola Lobitos. 
\par <#/>Playing a modern form of high-life jazz, Fela and the band began to carve their name in both Nigeria and Ghana. <#/>Then in 1966, inspired by the soul flavoured music of Sierra Leonean Geraldo Pino, he started to evolve his own Afro-beat style. 

\par <#/>With the help of the master-kit drummer Tony Allen, Fela was able to synchronize a new dance music which could match James Brown's rhythmic intensity and organisation, while remaining totally African. 
\par <#/>With his band Africa 70, Fela reflected t
he mood of the times. <#/>His was an African version of Black Power, and throughout the 70s he projected a volatile mix of heavy Afro-beat music and stark pidgin rhythm with confrontational politics and the blatant use of Marijuana. 
\par <#/>Often his personal life was }{\b\v\fs24 <+_as>}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 
outrageous as his polemical songs. <#/>His polygamous nature inspired the celebrated marriage to 27 women in 1978, however, he later modified his hard-line sexism to agree that women had a right to control their own bodies. 
\par <#/><h> A cumbersome 'bed' </h>
\par <#/>His notoriety guarantied him full houses in Europe and America, with healthy record sales to match up. 
\par <#/>Alone among African musicians, he had an international record contract which ensured a world market for his music and <-/everytime> he toured, he had been courted by the media. 
\par <#/>In Nigeria, however, Fela has 'made his own bed' and it has proved extremely uncomfortable. <#/>His particular target have been military governments and they have never been slow to respond. 
\par <#/>Undo
ubtedly the worst incident was the storming of the KalaKuta republic, his fortified compound in Lagos, which was invaded by several hundred soldiers, who beat Fela, his wives and musicians and threw his 71-year-old mother from an upstairs window, causing 
injuries from which she died a few weeks later. 
\par <#/>Fela himself suffered injuries which later affected his capability on trumpet and saxophone, from the heydays of the early 70s when he released seventeen albums in three years. 
\par <#/>Fela's output slowed down, with new releases coming every few years rather than months. 
\par <#/>Of late he was insisting that Afro-beat was over. <#/>That it was insulting to consider his music as mainly for dancing, it was African 'classical' music and people were not expected to dance until they had listened to his lyrics. </I>

\par }{\b\fs24 <I> <h> Tribal traditions join \lquote endangered species\rquote  list </h>
\par }{\fs24 <#/>ONE social scientist and philosopher at the turn of 14th century advanced a theory saying: "If yo
u want to tame a people and then rule colonise them effectively, then you must destroy its culture first and replace it with your own. <#/>I have in mind the two basic ingredients of culture - religion and language." 
\par <#/>How true is this theory for Africa? 
\par <#/>History is witness to this statement. <#/>But that is history. <#/>What should cause concern is the fast disappearing "remains" of cultural traditions of the African peoples, more so in Tanzania. <#/>The demise of our culture is accelerated by scien
ce and technology which is day by day reducing the size of our global village. 
\par <#/>One may dare say that what has come to be known as "the new phenomenon of Islamic fundamentalism" may in the final analysis be narrowed down to a "cultural protest" where a people are up in arms to protect their culture and tradition at any cost. 

\par <#/>But is it possible for one community or a nation to protect its culture in the face of the onslaught of modern mass communication of the likes of television, video and the prin
t media? <#/>Hard to say. <#/>But the <-/Isrealites> (Jews), Chinese and Japanese say they have managed to contain foreign cultures, and influences. 
\par <#/>Culture is too wide a subject to be fully covered in one newspaper article. <#/>Yet is it prudent to t
alk of Tanzanian culture where the society is moulded out of 120 tribes and heavily influenced by Middle Eastern (Persian and Arabic) cultures and those of the <-_crient><+_orient>? <#/>Hard to say again. 
\par <#/>The controversial mini-skirt is back - and in 
full swing. <#/>In the early 60s the mini-skirt was banned in Tanzania. <#/>Reason assigned by government was "to curb encroaching foreign cultural influences." <#/>Of late there were rumblings of government officials in Zanzibar that tourists must dress 
up properly. <#/>They again assign reasons of "protecting the Zanzibari culture." <#/>Simply said a choice between protection of Zanzibari culture and tourism development. 
\par <#/>I believe in today's world in Tanzania we should be talking of preserving the distinct tribal or ethnic cultures rather than the general and ambiguous "protection of Tanzanian culture." 
\par <#/>Similarly, and for the sake of argument, does it make sense to talk of "protecting Tanzanian youth against, say, American cultural influences?" <
#/>We should not lose sight of the fact that the American society is made up of various <-_culture><+_cultures> - English or Irish stock, German, Chinese, African, Red Indian etc. 
\par <#/>Concern of fast disappearing tribal or ethnic cultural traditions can be exemplified by change of gastronomy and fast fading "song and dance" among the Nyakyusa peoples of southern Tanzania. <#/>Look at the following personal example:
\par Roy and Lee are my elder children born in Lusaka and Chingola respectively. <#/>They grew up
 in Dar es Salaam. <#/>They were thus exposed to a wide range of cultures. <#/>Although both of their parents (my wife and I) are Nyakyusa, the youths have never seen or heard (leave alone eaten) of <ea/>}{\i\fs24 Ikifuge}{\fs24 
 - a delicious mashed sweet-potato cooked with beans. <#/>But they are well <-/acquinted> with meat pie and hot <-_dods><+_dogs>! <#/>Hardly a parents' fault one may dare say. 
\par <#/>In olden days a Nyakyusa house wife could concoct a variety of several dishes out of maize. <#/>From green maize out came <ea/>}{\i\fs24 Ikisujwa}{\fs24  - a kind of refined porridge made out of ground and sieved green maize, <ea/>}{\i\fs24 Kisyesye}{
\fs24  - a form of bread made cooked from pounded green maize, <ea_>}{\i\fs24 Ingati indeta<ea/>}{\fs24  - green maize cooked with beans or raw groundnuts <ea_>}{\i\fs24 Ikyindi kya kulumu<ea/>}{\fs24 
 stiff porridge made from flour of dried and pounded green maize. 
\par <#/>Similarly, one could concoct five different types of food-stuffs out of green bananas. <#/>Traditional gastronomy, an important cultural aspect of a people, is fading fast amongst t
he tribes of Tanzania. <#/>Is it a blessing in disguise whereby indigenous tribal gastronomy will slowly evolve into national dishes of the likes of the Chagga's <ea/>}{\i\fs24 ndafu}{\fs24 , <ea/>}{\i\fs24 supu}{\fs24  and <ea/>}{\i\fs24 mtori}{\fs24 
? <#/>Yes, this is challenge to other tribes in Tanzania to popularise their dishes too. 
\par <#/>On a similar note, Roy and Lee are experts at dancing }{\i\fs24 Reggae}{\fs24 , }{\i\fs24 Ragamuffin}{\fs24  and <ea/>}{\i\fs24 Kwasakwasa}{\fs24 . <#/>But they have never seen or danced <ea/>}{\i\fs24 Ikimele}{\fs24 , <ea/>}{\i\fs24 Kibota}{\fs24 
 or <ea/>}{\i\fs24 Magosi}{\fs24  once popular Nyakyusa tunes of the youth. <#/>As late as the Seventies <ea/>}{\i\fs24 imipalano}{\fs24  (weekend <ea/>ngoma competitions) <ea_>}{\i\fs24 Gya mang'oma<ea/>}{\fs24 , <ea/>}{\i\fs24 Isyobela}{\fs24 , <ea/>}{
\i\fs24 Kitumbwike}{\fs24  and the famous, graceful <ea/>}{\i\fs24 Ipenenga}{\fs24  took place almost monthly. <#/>When <-_Nyakyusa's><+_Nyakyusas> have had their drink <ea/>}{\i\fs24 kimpumu}{\fs24 
 or <ea/>mchujo - they like to sing. <#/>Usually they recite mind teasing Nyakyusa poetry called <ea/>}{\i\fs24 akapote}{\fs24 . 
\par <#/>Unfortunately the songs and dances, and <ea/>}{\i\fs24 kapote}{\fs24  of the <-_Nyakyusa's><+_Nyakyusas> have been replaced by <ea/>}{\i\fs24 kwasakwasa}{\fs24 , south African musical beats and }{\i\fs24 Ragamuffin}{\fs24 
. <#/>More so amongst the youth. <#/>Maybe a reflection of the 'generation gap war'. <#/>In a few years to come these Nyakyusa traditions remain as folklore only among the future generations if they are lucky to be reco
rded and preserved. <#/>This is an open challenge to writers, artists, publishers and politicians. <#/>Again, maybe the Bagamoyo College of Arts can take up this challenge. 
\par <#/>The Tanzanian tribal traditions and culture have indeed become endangered species". 
\par <#/>A CITES like agreement is urgently required in place for the culture and traditions of Tanzanian tribes. <#/>Time has come to come down to the reality. <#/><-_Lets><+_Let's> face it, there is no Tanzanian culture. <#/>What we have are tribal cul

\par <I> <h> Fashion, rhythm, lyrics and style - the Zairean way </h>
\par <h> Music Bag </h>
\par }{\fs24 <#/>There are four common tying bonds in Zaire musicians - the system of the lyric, <-/rythm>, fashion and the dancing styles. <#/>A new style of dancing appears every year which in turn, attracts both Tanzania musicians and pirates. 
\par <#/>These styles have <-/sideslined> Tanzanian music in most of the entertainment joints \emdash  discos,
 night clubs, boogies and even our radio stations. <#/>Wherever you go it is loaded with Zaire music. <#/>Whether you listen to a live local band, it must be mixed with some <ea/>lingala words, which according to their fans, make bands lively. 
\par <#/>A disco with no latest <ea/>Lingala, is not a complete disco, a year without one popular Zairean or Congolese musician touring the country for concert, is a waste for <ea/>bolingo enthusiasts. 
\par <#/>Many local bands frequently pirate <ea/>Lingala numbers during their live performances, copying Zaireans, }{\b\v\fs24 <+_it>}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 doesn\rquote t matter to them whether they underscore or not. <#/>Some even go beyond and copying }{
\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  how they shave hair and put on high waisted big trousers\emdash currently known as "<ea/>Ebola" \emdash  with the theme of attracting patrons. 
\par <#/>"We find it tough to compete with Zaireans when it comes to music", says a Ngorongoro Heroes Band member vocalist-cum-dancer, Kassy Kasambula. <#/>Some musicians say their fans will never get satisfied if they don\rquote t play some o
f the favourite hits composed by Zaireans. <#/>This is more <-/luctrative> because if they don\rquote t play, they might end up <-/loosing> them. 
\par <#/>There are two classes of music fan \endash  those who prefer "<ea/>Soukous", a fast music dance and those who prefer "R
humba", a slow music. <#/>"<ea/>Soukous" includes numbers of Soukous Stars Band, Lutchiana 100% Mobulu, Kanda Bongoman, Freddy Majunga, Koffi Olomide, Wenge Musica, Papa Wemba, Samba Mapangala et Orchestre Virunga. 
\par <#/>"Rhumba" includes former TP OK numbers "Bomangai, Ekaba Kaba, Mamu, Mario", Madilus compositions like "Biya, Apula, Djaffer", some of the Pepe Kalle\rquote s old numbers like "Amour Sanda, Likamboa, Moyibi" and Nyboma Mwandido\rquote s compositions. 

\par <#/>Many patrons have differing points for their prefer
ences. <#/>Some debate it is popular in Africa and diaspora as well as in some parts of Europe precisely because of the mixed grill menu, which Zaireans offer. <#/>They never concentrate on one beat, they <-/continously> climb at the peak, create new soun
ds with mixing beats and create rhythm patterns from other parts of the world with their own system and language. 
\par <#/>Music analysts say it is because <-_Zairean><+_Zaireans> take music as a career and are, therefore, serious about it, they never regard it as a hobby. 
\par <#/>According to some music oriented promoters, it is not because our friends (Zaireans) have the best music instruments in the continent, but because of the tactic manner in which they use instruments to create unique sounds and the way they
 promote themselves. 
\par <#/>It is also realistic that both Zaireans and Congolese have proved to be far ahead in the use of the new technology. <#/>Before a musician releases his album, he first carries out a thorough research by travelling from one country 
to another, seeking for }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 ideas <-_on> which he can use to create his music \emdash not in }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24  rush to make money like local artistes \emdash  Tanzanians. 
\par <#/>Zairean\rquote s artistes have, however, earned themselves huge names through their beat but not lyrics for, indeed, }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24  majority of fans worldwide do not understand <ea/>Lingala. 
\par <#/>A Radio One disc jockey, Sunday Shomari, says local musicians never land blames on radio stations, for what they have been doing, for allegedly giving them a raw deal and seemingly favouring Zairean\rquote s numbers during Salaam\rquote s Programmes. 

\par <#/>"What we air on both television and radio stations, are what we are requested to do by our viewers and listeners and, of course, we don\rquote t want to let them down", says Othman Njaidi \emdash  an ITV music presenter \emdash 
 adding that local artistes would do better if they rehearsed their songs before recording.

\par <#/>A veteran bar owner at Ilala, George Just Because, says <ea/>Lingala music features prominently and attracts <-_customer><+_customers> because "you can\rquote t run a bar without Zairean music."

\par }{\fs24 <#/>In the last five years, Koffi Olomide has captured the hearts and minds of <ea/>Lingala music lovers all the way from Africa to Paris to Abidjan, but Olomide may not cope up }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24 
 with the late Franco's or even Franco's re-incarnate because of the different music styles. 
\par <#/>Ko
ffi's unique style of music - <ea/>Tcha-Tcho - had made him win awards in Paris where he dwells. <#/>When Olomide won the coveted - "The best African Artist" - award for two consecutive years in Cote d'Ivoire in 1992 and 1993, it wasn't so much <ea/>Linga
la that his fans went wild over but Koffi's "<ea/>tcha-tcho" style of soul music. 
\par <#/>"It is music from the heart", Koffi said during his tour in Tanzania, 1993. <#/>Koffi taught music by himself }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 , his taste in music ranges from Tabu Ley (his mo
st favourite) and Abeti Masikini to Al Jarreau, Stevie Wonder and Frank Sinatra. 
\par <#/>Koffi feels "<ea/>Tcha-tcho" style is quite different from the normal <ea/>Lingala beat although he admits he's inevitably been influenced by the sounds he heard during his tender age }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>expression}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 in Kinshasa, Zaire. 

\par <#/>Coming from a family of music lovers, both his mum and dad knew the late Franco very well. <#/>Olomide was shaped in music by his older brother Jonyko, who was most influenced in music. <#/>Jonyk'o intr
oduced his younger brother, Olomide, to most prominent Zairean musicians when he was at the age of four }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>expression}{\fs24 
, many of whom were among the hottest local artists in Zaire. <#/>Koffi was never ever meant to become a musician as far as his strict father was concerned, be that as it may. 
\par <#/>Koffi "obeyed" his father insofar, as he got his baccalaureat in mathematics before proceed- }{\b\fs24 <O_>}{\b\v\fs24 two or three words}{\b\fs24 <O/>}{\fs24  France, where he was awarded a degree in economics, he turned to be a musician. 
\par <#/>But at the same time, he avidly indulged in studies of French poets - <-_Bauderaire><+_Baudelaire>, Lamartine and Jacques Brel. <#/>What is more,}{\b\fs24 <O_>}{\b\v\fs24 two or three words}{\b\fs24 <O/> }{\fs24 
evolved quite naturally during those university years. <#/>The honey-toned crooner, Koffi, started his music career by singing other artistes' songs before he began creating compositions of his own. 
\par <#/>Encouraged to continue singing by friends who thought he had a lovely voice (which he does) Koffi's song writing did not seriously take off unti
l an older musician - Bobo Veron put a guitar in his hands and showed him the necessary basics of strumming a tune. 
\par <#/>Koffi's father, Papa Charles, was a strict accountant and he hardly wanted his son to get involved in the music. <#/>Koffi told reporters in 1993 during his both tour to Kenya and Tanzania }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  that his main motive of }{
\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24  composing was not because of money but for public pleasure. 
\par <#/>It was Jonyk'o who put his feet down }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>idiom}{\fs24  and insisted that Koffi sing his own music an
d even go professional, which he did in 1978. <#/>Initially, he released only singles, most sentimental songs that weren't for dancing but rather like western countries style. <#/>They were short and sweet lyrics and soulful story lines that one sits back
 and listens to. 
\par <#/>Olomide released his first LP in 1983 after completeing his college, the LP, "<ea/>Ngounda" or "Exile" got the market in the western countries because of its more injection to the funky dance rhythms }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 .

\par <#/>She pointed to a number of reasons that lead to a woman's choice to }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24  Taarab music. <#/>"First is the melodic simplicity, the touchy themes, and a mellow stage outlook", she started. 
\par <#/>She further went on to say that originally Taarab was strictly a dance for women. <#/>It was purposely composed to fit their position as far as the general social outlook was concerned. 
\par <#/>"The rejection of female artists to Jazz groups in favour of Taarab orchestras has never surprised me" }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>sense}{\fs24 , said Asha Rajab. 
\par <#/>"We have three groups from a traditional troupe, a jazz band to a Taarab orchestra, but most of the female talents opt for Taarab as opposed to jazz". 
\par <#/>Aisha Rajab, one of the reigning Taarab vocalists in a newly reformed J.W.T.Z. Taarab, said she feels secure as a Taarab singer. 
\par <#/>She accounts }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24  all that interest owes to music\rquote s poetic language and a sense of urban <-/femininism> that has excelled in a perfect back-up style. 
\par <#/>Aisha Rajabu whose musical debut was with a Temeke-based Yemen Musical Club, said she joined a Taarab group because she felt the music is in her blood, besides, "it is the only music a woman can use to express herself at length". 
\par <#/>"Contrary to what is seen in dance <-_band\rquote s><+_bands>, stage performances, musicologists and the audiences, Taarab in fact is an alien trend immersed wildly into self-praise, veiled attacks, and supremacy", she analysed. 
\par <#/>Crescencia Hadada and Sister Beatrice of Polisi Jazz Band, strongly oppose the idea that Taarab is a female music }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 . <#/>They both believe in free choice of interest. 
\par <#/>Beatrice, a new talent, largely expected to take over from Nuru Mhina, recalls how she made it as a vocalist with her band. 
\par <#/>"I was singing for a Kurasini-based Anglican Church choir when Adelgot Haule proposed the idea of me joining his band. 
\par <#/>"It was a case of being at the right moment and time", she smiled. 
\par <#/>"It\rquote s not that I would\lquote ve turned down Captain John Komba\rquote s offer had he come first with his TOT proposal". 
\par <#/>However, Lucy Mela, a young female singer with Mwenge Jazz, has a different opinion. 
\par <#/>"The chances are open so long as you possess a sense of determination in what you intend to do as an artist", she said. 
\par <#/>"If you aim at winning popularity and shaping your personality before fellow partners, you might be misinterpreted and frustrated, and the jinx is, the whole thing could be counter-productive", she explained. 
\par <#/>Salim Abdu, a keyboard player with the Dar es Salaam-based All Stars argues that, most people think wrongly about women <-/per forming> in Taarab groups. 
\par <#/>"In Zanzibar and Pemba, Taarab is taken as a social music }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  done in a way compatible to their environment, in the mainland, Taarab is categorised as Swahili and coastal or the music of the urban people", said Abdu. 

\par <#/>"The discovery of artists like JKT\rquote s Elizabeth Sijila or Patricia Hilali could be taken as a decisive blow that silenced the coastal people. 
\par <#/>Another dimension to mainland Taarab which many of my interviewees accepted is the belief that is expressed satirically. <#/>"<ea_>Jaluo Kuimba Taarab ni Kioja<ea/>", implying that Taarab is never done with an artist who doesn\rquote 
t possess a coastal or islamic }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>orth}{\fs24  background". 
\par <#/>The other side of it is a direct attempt on the part of Jazz bands to frustrate female singers. <#/>Since they were formed in the late 1970s, Mlimani Park Orchestra have never had a female singer }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 . 
\par <#/>"I don\rquote t know the reason but I think they are just reluctant to take chance
s because they have seen <-/no one> doing that in our band. <#/>However, we are ready to take any of them if one has determination and commitment", said Machaku Salum, the band\rquote s Secretary General. 
\par <#/>Salum pointed out that women are much needed in dance bands because their presence has an attracting effect in the musical form since they naturally have a soft, clean and a high-pitched voice. 
\par <#/>Kida Wazire is perhaps the creme-de-la-creme among female artists who took a swing at dance bands, and perhaps the most experienced having played both <-/artforms>. 
\par <#/>Her views show her much as a matured artist rather than a back-up singer. <#/>Kida\rquote s viewpoint, however, has a major typical ignorance }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>sense}{\fs24 . 
\par <#/>She cites individual endeavour and the nation\rquote s unmusical atmosphere as the causes of this uneven distribution of the number of female artists in the scene. 
\par <#/>"I don\rquote t want to mention <-/any one> in this context, but considering how females have risen and <-_fell><+_fallen> in their music careers, it is enough a reason in itself", she said, "female artist need }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 simple musical forms which can end positively, providing her marital possibilities for example", she said. 
\par <#/>She adds that women go for Taarab because it is the only semi-commercial music a woman can take part without sweating much. 
\par <#/>"Professional music is always painfully attained. <#/>We fail to hit jackpots beyond our borders because we don\rquote t want to sweat, we want cherries without working for them", she said bitterly. 
\par <#/>Contrary to other female singers, Kida Waziri still feels she can perform miracles in the male-dominated profession. 
\par <#/>"I am no longer a laid-back, shy, so naive a girl }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\b\fs24  }{\fs24 I used to be. <#/>I\lquote m not dependent on anyone but my voice" she said matter-of-factly. 
\par <#/>Kida also works a six-hour performance unscathed and plays a ten-drum kit at the same time. 
\par <#/>"By singing, composing, playing some recessive instruments, and playing 10 drums is }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  the highest form of achievement a female artist has ever attained", she said proudly. 
\par <#/>"To be able to compete inside a dance music group, you have to <-_practice><+_practise> hard and tirelessly. <#/>It is only through tolerance and determination that we will make it", she advised. 
\par <#/>Lack of female artists in the dance-music arena seems to be answered by <-_the> history itself. 
\par <#/>The survey in the East and Central African music history from the founders of our music such as African Jazz, Kilwa Jazz, TP OK Jazz, Dar Jazz, all of which ha

\par }{\fs24 <#/>Having full details about the pillars of the Tanzanian singing machinery and their disciples isn\rquote

\par <#/>Mbaraka Mwinshehe, Muhidini Mwalimu Gurumo, Hassan Bitchuka, Salum Zahoro, Marijani Rajabu are names found in the gallery of all time masters of the Tanzanian vocal traditional let alone being the most inspirational band leaders.

trick Balisidya, Hemedi Maneti and Nico Zenge Kalla who came on the scene later and injected new life into common singing styles and techniques which had long exceeded their expiry dates, having been around non-stop since the 1970s. 
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang2057 {<#/>}{\fs24 <h> <fr/>Animateur </h>
\par <#/>Nico Zenge Kalla was perhaps the biggest '<fr/>animateur' to fill }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24  Juwata Jazz\rquote s loss of their key musicians, Hassan Bitchuka, Muhidini Mwalimu and Fresh Jumbe who had crossed over to DDC Mlimani park. 
\par <#/>After having 'signed' him }{\b\v\fs24 <+_on>}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 from Orchestra Vina Vina, Juwata made the best use of Zenge Kalla\rquote s sneaky, high-pitched voice to <-/repolish> their lost gleam. 
\par <#/>Teaming up with other high-voiced singers, Tino Masinge, Moshi William and Suleiman Mbwembwe and releasing a handful of cuts in 'Solemba', 'Priscilla', and 'Bahati', a mellower <-/midtempo> ballad which remains a typical Zenge Kalla classic. 
\par <#/>This new, highly-unmatched singing style was kind of retrospective, and the first of <-_it\rquote s><+_its> kind to emerge in Tanzanian dance music. 
\par <#/>The vocal lines owe heavily to the Bronx or the West Coast-influenced rap and Hip-Hop. <#/>Packed with }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24  line-up of evergreen artists, he won many fans who admired his unique singing style }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
. 
\par <#/>In a country where music is predominantly a male profession, and the male singers whose vocal range plays between an alto and a tenor, }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 great amount of Tanzanian music can be heard in keys F and G. <#/>These keys are much used in our music because they suit the vocal range of our singers. 
\par <#/>In a lesser account, key A which contains 3 sharps and 4 flats has also been used in some songs. <#/>Tracks that lived in this key include Mlimani Park\rquote s "<ea_>Tangazia Mataifa Yote<ea/>", and "Maudhi", a composition of Luiza Elias John. 

\par <#/>Bitchuka\rquote s "Aija" and "<ea_>Duniani Kuna Mambo<ea/>" are the finest examples of songs done in the highest pitch, a range very few musicians can cope with. 
\par <#/>A positive analytical classification of our singers should always start like this: Hassan Bitchuka (TFTU), Hamisi Juma (a semi retired singer) and Bima Lee's former vocalist, Roy Bashekanako (Novatus Rweyemamu). 
\par <#/>Any other classification of our singers would go to a range of alto-categorisation which most of the male singers own. <#/>The long list of the <-/altoists> is long, but the most popular ones are Shaaban Dede, Nassir Lubua and Benno Villa Anthony. 

\par <#/>The third range tenor includes Hemedi Maneti, Dr. Remmy Ongala, Muhidini Mwalimu Gurumo and Max Bushoke are the most popular. 
\par <#/><h> Distinctive </h>
\par <#/>There's also a class of a few gifted artists with unique vocal forms that play distinctive roles in their bands. 
\par <#/>Hamza Masongi of <ea/>Polisi Jazz whose wafery thin shaky voice is a big flavour in the band singing s
tyle. <#/>Suleiman Mbwembwe, Mohamed Salum Gotagota and Jerry Nashon, all having played for Vijana Orchestra have natural strained falsettos which many bands find hard to replace. 
\par <#/>Singers who excelled in this trend include Mbaraka Mwinshehe and Hassan Bitchuka both of whom had dictating roles in their bands in creating the <-_bands><+_bands'> repertoire that won them audiences. 
\par <#/>Listening to numbers like "Tina", "<ea_>Wajomba Wamechacha<ea/>", "<ea_>Bi Velina<ea/>" or "Gloria" and "<ea_>Mwana Mkiwa<ea/>" evokes the glory behind the harmonious vocal prowess inside the masters of the voice. 
\par <#/><h> Masters\lquote  voice </h>
\par <#/>Alongside their unique singing talents, Mbaraka Mwinshehe outclassed others in vocal perfection. <#/>He sang in a way that indicates an interchangeable flow of vocal ranges, even to the naive ear of an unprofessional listener. 
\par <#/>The coming of '<afr/>cavacha', a vibrant Zairean dance style that was introduced by Zaiko Langa Langa, beating the old <-/rhumba> styles of great bands of the day; T.P.O.K. Jazz and Conga Success\lquote , the music scene saw a new singing trend. 

\par <#/>}{\scaps\fs24 A }{\fs24 wave of male singers such as Canta Danos Nyboma Mwandido (Les Kamale) Luswama Matoba, Kilola (Lipua-Lipua) and Mfui Mwane (Kiam) came with high-pitched soprano voices that was '<fr/>cavacha''s }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>orth}{\fs24 
 dancehall magic. 
\par <#/>Being carried away by the '<fr/>cavacha' fever, Tanzanian bands began emulating their Zairean counterparts in a domain that not only needed a lot of multi-melodics but also fancy instrumental display. 
\par <#/>Whether influenced by the '<fr/>cavacha cult' or not, Tanzania singers slurped up the new style wholesale. 
\par <#/>Salim Zahoro of Shikamoo Jazz is perhaps the oldest singing figure whose voice has remained consistent to date. <#/>Zahoro has maintained his clean cut voice for five decades. 
\par <#/>Musicians point out that their vocal capabilities are often thwarted by imbibing locally made liquor popularly known as <ea/>}{\i\fs24 Gongo}{\fs24 . 
\par <#/>"The quality of a good singer doesn\rquote t only match his ability to produce a clear voice but the power to merge the melody into the harmony\rdblquote , said Michael 'King' Enoch. 
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24 <#/>"A good singer should also be a natural '<fr/>animateur', since his presence is what leads to stimulating a chase choral accompaniment with his fellow singers", he added. }{\fs24 </X></I>

\par <I><h> All That Jazz </h>
\par }{\fs24 <#/>}{\b\fs24 In Dar es Salaam at the moment, Jazz music is celebrating a birth, or rather a resurgence of sorts. <#/>For this year has seen the introduction of jazz music as the latest trend to go on the plethora of programs that the city\rquote

\par <#/>}{\fs24 Not only the radio\rquote s Aficionados have felt that jazz music was <-/conspicously> absent, but have also given in to the great public demand on the part of the city\rquote

\par <#/>"Jazz as an artform is somewhat like a family heirloom. <#/>It\rquote s so special", said Ahmed Kipozi, a jazz program host for }{\i\fs24 Radio One}{\fs24 . 
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang1031 {<#/>}{\lang2057 'Jazz Hour' comes as an inspiration to the city\rquote

\par <#/>So we believe it\rquote s high

\par <#/>For acid jazz is not a fad, critics maintain, and a number of jazz authorities say it really isn\rquote t a new influence in jazz, nor a perfect representation of the music itself. 
\par <#/>}{\b\fs24 <h> Experimenters </h>

\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang1031 {<#/>}{\lang2057 This is the question I put to Ahmed Kipozi, the programme host, who employed his near legendary talents to paint a more compelling picture to address the deficiency.

\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang1031 {<#/>}{\lang2057 I (writer) personally, don\rquote t know when jazz officially was founded in America, so <-_doesn\rquote t><+_don\rquote t> the authorities }{\b\v\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\lang2057 
. <#/>All I know is that it\rquote s about a century old, starting somewhere in the late 1880s in the south, primarily New Orleans. 
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang2057 {<#/>}{\fs24 A number of music art forms were associated with the Black community shortly after slavery ended in 1865. <#/>The music included diff
erent piano styles, the most important being ragtime. <#/>We also saw the development of blues after slavery as well. <#/>And we also saw the continuation of the evolution of some of the music that slaves had made, and some of them began to develop into o
ther forms of black, popular music. <#/>Jazz, blues, ragtime, marching band and dance music, were among the original art forms conceived within the black community. 
\par <#/>}{\b\fs24 <h> Slaves </h>
\par }{\fs24 <#/>Authorities say jazz actually evolved from dance music and marching
 band music. <#/>Therefore sometime in 1890, probably we began to see a music evolving that is different from the dance music and the marching band music forms. <#/>People called this 'hot music'. <#/>We don\rquote 
t know where the word jazz came from. <#/>No one person invented it. 
\par <#/>By the late 1890s, this music was spelled 'jass' or 'jaz'. <#/>In fact it\rquote s believed those terms came about in terms of reference to what you did to those other art forms of music that made them hot. <#/>And so the adjective, over
 a period of time became the noun. 
\par <#/>What I clearly know is that the foundation for jazz lies in the African American community, and lies <-/cleary> in the retention they had in the music of Africa and during slavery. 
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang1031 {<#/>}{\lang2057 We know also that it was influ
enced by the brass bands that were very popular in the south, primarily the Catholic south. <#/>Important events <-/occured> in New Orleans that allowed jazz to grab a foothold in the industry. <#/>For one, the New Orleans three-tier-society, consisting o
f blacks, whites (creoles) and coloured, travelled within their own circles, but had more access to whites than blacks. 
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang2057 {<#/>}{\fs24 Before the three-tier-society was dissolved, prior to the turn of the century, New Orleans was known for it\rquote s red light district. <#
/>And creoles had more opportunities than blacks to get jobs in the district brothels, restaurants, bars etc. <#/>But when blacks went down-town to play or scrape for a bite of something to eat, they went with their music along with them. <#/>In fact the 
New Orleans red light district became so popular, the majority of musicians being blacks and creoles. <#/>But pretty soon whites began also hearing this new music and played it as well. 
\par <#/>When the red light district was closed in 1917, it forced black and creole musicians to search for employment elsewhere. <#/>Many moved to other communities. <#/>Also a white music company recorded a tune performed by a white jazz group, }{\i\fs24 
The Original Dixieland Jazz Band}{\fs24  that gave jazz more public exposure. 
\par <#/>The most 
important of jazz musicians left New Orleans and settled in Chicago and the city became the next important stop in the history of jazz. <#/>Important names included 'King' Joe Oliver, Jelly Roll Morton, Warren 'Baby' Dobbs and his brother Johnny, the lege
ndary Louis 'satchmo' Armstrong and 'Kid' Ory. <#/>The only influential white group among them was }{\i\fs24 The New Orleans Rhythm Kings}{\fs24 . 
\par <#/>The <-/afore mentioned> musicians brought to Chicago the highest level of New Orleans jazz. <#/>The second style of jazz after New Orleans is <-/reffered> to as the Chicago style. <#/>Important figures that represented the Chicago style included the}{
\i\fs24  Austin High Gang}{\fs24 , a white group. <#/>They were eventually joined by other white musicians in Chicago including Benny Goodman, Gene Krupa and Bix Bierderbecke. <#/>These musicians stimulated white acceptance of jazz in the US. 
\par <#/>But still the most important creator during the 1920s was Louis Armstrong. <#/>He organised two groups under the names \'82}{\i\fs24 Louis Armstrong Hot 5}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 Louis Armstrong Hot 7}{\fs24 . 
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang1031 {<#/>}{\lang2057 
And the recordings of these two groups are the epitome of what New Orleans and Chicago jazz was in the late 1920s. <#/>Armstrong left Chicago for a year and moved to New York city, where he performed with an 11-piece band organised by F
letcher Henderson. <#/>This band laid the foundation in terms of musical format as well as style and direction of what eventually was referred to as the big band or swing-music. 
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang2057 {<#/>}{\fs24 Then came the middle period. <#/>This period included such jazz forms as 
swing, bebop, cool jazz and hard bop. <#/>Swing has a style authorities believe all good jazz musicians should adopt or be able to imitate. <#/>It\rquote 
s generally played by a big band, and the musical arrangements tend to feature unison melodic lines. <#/>The 
arrangements usually featured back ground harmonies, call and response patterns, a flat four beats per measure and lots of riff patterns. <#/>Swing music saw <-_>it\rquote s<+_its> hey days from the late 1920s to the early 1940s. 
\par <#/>}{\b\fs24 <h> Harmonies </h>
\par }{\fs24 <#/>Bebop
 consists of a small group of musicians, usually as quartets or quintets. <#/>The main focus is improvisation which is spontaneous musical creativity by an instrumentalist. <#/>Many bebop compositions are based on the 'contrafact', which are compositions 
that use the harmonies of other compositions such as "I\rquote ve Got Rhythm" and "What Is This Thing Called Love". 
\par <#/>Bebop composers often take harmonies from a number of songs and add new melodies. <#/>One cannot copyright harmonies. <#/>Cool jazz tends to em
phasize rhythm. <#/>It features 'conjuct' or connected melodies. <#/>It has lots of sophisticated harmonies. <#/>Hard bop is a continuation of bebop brought to life after Charles Parker died. 
\par <#/>However it tended to de-emphasize the 'contrafact'. <#/>Hard bop and bebop both feature swinging rhythm sections and great improvisation. 
\par <#/>I would say the middle period, especially swing was more popular than the early period or the later period. <#/>It tended to attract more jazz authorities to the music beca
use you could dance to it. <#/>It did not require a sophisticated knowledge of music to understand or enjoy it. <#/>So it tended to draw a wide spectrum of persons. <#/>They were in my opinion, more community based because they were playing for country ty
pe activities such as dances. 
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24 <#/>Popular swing artists included Thelonious Monk, Charles  Parker, Dizzy Gillepsie, Fats Navarro, Max Roach and Charles Mingus. Miles Davis represented both cool jazz and hard bop. John Coltrane, Woody Shaw, Freddie Hubb
ard and Cannon Ball Adderley played hard bop.}{\fs24 </X>
\par So this is just a glimpse of part of the homework the jazz-hour program has. <#/>Jazz is much more sophisticated and a more difficult art form compared to R&B, funk,, }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24  zouk, reggae or soul music. 
\par <#/>Habits die hard, and people like to hear what they know. <#/>What they know is what they\rquote ll like. <#/>And what they\rquote ll like is what they\rquote 
ll understand. <#/>With all that jazz and on a Sunday Morning, <-_its><+_it's> more than a double pleasure. </I>

\par <#/>For the Western music, eight dancers took to the floor for their final disco competition after gruelling two earlier rounds.

\par <#/>Among the eight finalists were Ramma Best, Jimmy Jackson,
\par Robert Cool, Best Seller, Super Mlaka, Jimmy London and a young boy Michael Jackson, who often pulled the crowd to appraise his talents. 
\par <#/>All the four groups of two dancers were in turn called out to dance three numbers of low funk, high funk (breakdance) and reggae. <#/>There was always overwhelming applause from music fanatics after every performance. 
\par <#/>But when Ramma Best came in to prove his prowess in funk and reggae, he produced some of the <-/robbot>-like jerks and more calculated moves for most outstanding applause. 
\par <#/>Twenty-six-year old Ramma Best, displayed even more talents in breakdance. <#/>He at one time danced while juggling his hat from his head to his right foot. <#/>He was also swift elegant and steady. <#/>He had complete cont

\par <#/>Nicknamed "Michael Jackson", Ramma made twists and turns just like Michael Jackson as seen on TV. 
\par <#/>There was no lady dancer this time, but the Kigoma Railways Hotel management is optimistic that some might come out for future competitions. 
\par <#/>There were three judges - two British tourists from London and a Tanzania lady. <#/>The experienced British dancers Paul and Cris Ferguson with their counterpart came up with a list of all eight dancers with their points scored. 
\par <#/>The first prize of 10,000/- went to Rama Best who scored 244.5 points, while the second prize of 8,000/- was snatched by Jimmy Jackson who scored 238 points. 
\par <#/>Jimmy London, who scored 234 points, received the third prize of 6,000/- and 3,500/- went to Best Seller, who was fourth. 
\par <#/>Robert Cool, always cool even when dancing in competitions, was placed fifth and went home with 2,500/-. 
\par <#/>While Western music lovers continued digging a send-off dance for the winners, the hotel's Mess Hall was live with Zairean music. <#/>Though impromptly registered for the competition, some 12 competitors took to demonstrate their skills.

\par <#/>Ndalichako started writing while he was doing O-level education at Moshi Technical School between 1973 and 1976, "at the time I wanted to write a novel and I sent three }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>orth}{\fs24  swahili manuscripts <-/antitled> <ea_>}{\i\fs24 
Pazia la Damu<ea/>, <ea_>April mosi<ea/> and }{\fs24 <ea_>}{\i\fs24 Mtume wa Uhalifu}{\fs24 <ea/> to <-/Heineman> educational books in Kenya, intending the first two titles to appear in thei
r African writer series. <#/>After both manuscripts were rejected sent them to Transafrica Publishers in Nairobi which also rejected the manuscripts," he said. 
\par <#/>Prior to this, Ndalichako had sent the manuscript <ea_>}{\i\fs24 "Mtumwa wa Uhalifu<ea/>"}{\fs24  to the Tanz
ania Publishing House (TPH). <#/>He said the manuscript could not be traced when he visited their headquarters for a follow up after a long silence. 
\par <#/>"This was what had prompted me to send my subsequent two attempts at novel writing to Nairobi. <#/>Unf
ortunately although the rejection slips explicitly indicated that the rejection was based on their respective house philosophies. <#/>I was nevertheless discouraged and did not attempt to find another publisher and the two manuscripts have since been lost
 while I was at Dar Technical College between 1977 and 81" he recalls. 
\par <#/>Ndalichako\rquote s first short story }{\i\fs24 The Height of Absurdity}{\fs24  was published in the Sunday News in June 1978. 
\par <#/>"The short story column was then three Sundays old and my contribution was the second to be run in the column after <-_Andunis><+_>Anduni's> }{\i\fs24 Revenge of Aduneta}{\fs24  was published on 28, }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24 
 May 1978 and on 4 June the same year. <#/>I have ever since been contributing regularly to the column for the past 13 years and the number that have been published by the Sunday news alone as of August 18 this year is 63," }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24 

\par His first Kiswahili short story was published in Mzalendo on 10, }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\b\fs24  }{\fs24 June 1984 entitled "Mkuki Kwa Nguruwe! <#/>}{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\b\fs24  }{\fs24 Ndalichako has subsequently contri
buted stories to various Kiswahili papers. 
\par <#/>African writers who inspired Ndalichako to an extent that he began seriously thinking of writing are Chinua Achebe, Vincent Chukwuemeka Ike, Cyprian Ekwensi, Ngugi wa Thiongo, Barbara Kimenya, with her Moses 
series which Ndalichako read in primary school. 
\par <#/>"Another major thing that contributed to my desire to read was the fact that during my formative years, my mother Mrs. <#/>Mary Ndalichako, used to subscribe to such magazines as Film (featuring Lance Sp
earmen and Zollo) Boom (fearless Fang) Drum and Trust and which I was very fond of although I was in primary school (between 1967 and 72). 
\par <#/>"My vocabulary came to increase considerably as a result of this interest of mine. <#/>This may be the reason th
at I feel much at home writing in English although I could have written more Kiswahili stories had they not proved to be difficult to get published in the newspapers," he said. 
\par <#/>Talking about problems of publishing he says: "Problems that I have encoun
tered with publishers in trying to publish my works in book form vary according to categories of publishers. <#/>From my experience, I came to know that most public publishing <-_institution><+_institutions> actually give much preference on 'who the write
r is in the society' first then on the quality of work submitted to them. 
\par <#/>"It is thus very difficult for a budding writer to get published by those institutions as <-_mostly><+_most> regard it as a favour to publish a manuscript sent to them. 
\par <#/>Given the number of manuscripts they receive each year and the few titles they can publish each year, they can justify rejecting any number they wish, even if in reality the manuscript is better than those they chose to publish," he laments}{\b\fs24

\par <#/>Dede, the first son in a family of three, was born in 1955 in Kagera region. <#/>His interest in music dates back to 1972 when he joined the Tanu Youth League Jazz Band of Biharamulo in Kagera. 
\par <#/>His parents were not happy with his interest in music, instead insisted that he become a farmer. 
\par <#/>When asked why his parents were against music, he replied: "My father had already noticed that I loved music more than anything else. <#/>So he had doubts whether I could excel in both music and farming." 
\par <#/>However, these demands did not make Dede lose his interest in music. 
\par <#/>In }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24  mid-70's he decided to go back to Bukoba and joined the Kagera Police Jazz Band. <#/>With the band he gained experience as a drummer and a vocalist. 
\par <#/>Late in 1971, he joined the Kasababo Jazz Band of Kigoma for almost a year, before reuniting with his father at Kanyigo village in Kagera region where he concentrated on farming. 
\par <#/>Dede says "I couldn\rquote t do without music". <#/>His dreams came true. <#/>He became one of those members who formed Aluta Continua Jazz Band in 1977. <#/>His band manager Nkana advised and encouraged him to stick to vocals. 
\par <#/>Asked how long he stayed with the group, Dede said he was not happy with the band because chances of progress were very slim, as the band was operating on }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24  part-time basis. 
\par <#/>He later entered the Mirambo Jazz Band of Tabora Region. <#/>This was late in 1977, briefly before crossing to Tabora Jazz Band in 1978. 
\par <#/>His first recorded song <ea_>}{\i\fs24 Kutangatanga Sio Maisha<ea/>}{\fs24  proved his musical talents with the band, apart from being one of the youngest musicians in the group.

\par }{\fs24 <#/>IF medals were to be awarded to indigenous Tanzanians who have made efforts to portray to the world the country's abundance of wildlife and natural beauty, Lilla N. Lyogello deserves a gold. 
\par <#/>This is not because Lyogello is a trained wildlife manager or park warden-tourism only. <#/>The bespectacled, tall and slim Lilla would be thus credited for his authorship of the book "A Guide to Tanzanian National Parks." 
\par <#/>First published in 1988 by tourist publishing consult, the 263-paged book has won rave reviews from authoritative sources, including former minister for natural resources and tourism, Solomon Ole Saibull. 
\par <#/>"This manual is going to be useful not only t
o visitors, but to students at all levels," said Saibull in his foreword, <-/vinticating> the book's worthiness in giving the reader a reliable introduction to Tanzania National Parks and other wildlife areas. 
\par <#/>Forsbroke, former conservator of Ngorongo
ro, said: "This book will meet a long felt want. <#/>There are several good park guides and attractive brochures issued by lodges and travel agents, but nothing so far presents a full picture of Tanzania national parks. <#/>This book has been designed to 
serve the dual purpose of acquainting Tanzanians of the richness of their inheritance, and publicising Tanzania's attractions overseas". 
\par <#/>Said the Tanzania Tourist Corporation (TTC):"The parks are well described, the major attractions and the maps being
 valuable features. <#/>This book, therefore, must find its way onto the desk of every concerned travel agency and tour operator within Tanzania and overseas." 
\par <#/>"For general knowledge", contributed the Ngorongo crater conservation area authority "the b
ook will assist students in secondary and post secondary schools, particularly members of Malihai clubs of Tanzania as well as driver guides, to know about the wildlife parks of Tanzania which they hear so much on the radio and which they cherish to visit
......" 
\par <#/>The sources having said all that I was supposed to as I was about to write a review of the book after going through it several times, searching and cornering the author for a chat was the only task that remained. 
\par <#/>"Many people like to call 
me Lyongello and not Lyogello due to reasons which I myself am yet to grasp," said the rather modest and soft-spoken author of the book, in the offices of State Travel Services Ltd on Samora Avenue in Dar es Salaam, where he is manager. 
\par <#/>Born in 1948 at Igurubi Village in Nzega, Tabora Region, the fifth child in a family of eight, Lyogello told me that his writing interests were accidental rather than otherwise. 
\par <#/>Being a park warden soon after graduating from the College of African Wildlife Management, Mweka, in 1972, he was stationed in the Serengeti National Park for a year. 
\par <#/>"My job involved a lot of writing reports upon reports in a daily basis during which time the idea of writing a book started to grow within me," he said of his "accident" with pen and paper. 
\par <#/>Writing daily or monthly reports is one thing and writing a book is another, <-_though><+_thought> Lyogello, as he pondered how to go about his projected idea. <#/>"I decided to enrol with the international correspondence course an
d studied freelance journalism and effective English", he said. 
\par <#/>The course plus the reports coupled with questions visitors always shot at him gave Lyogello a good foundation for book writing. <#/>Within no time and with the assistance of a friend and
 co-author, Gratian Luhikula, out came the "Northern Tanzania Tourist Guide" in mid 1980s. 
\par <#/>For six years, between 1973-78, Lyogello worked at the National Park's headquarters in Arusha as head of the public relations unit under the then director of wi
ldlife, the late Dereck Bryeson. <#/>He became more and more involved in lots of writing and educational programmes in the villages and schools. 
\par <#/>The guide to Tanzania National Parks came into being at this time when Lyogello not only concluded that wi
thout an educational manual his work would have continued to be vapour formed because most of the questions those he taught about wildlife were the same }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 . 
\par <#/>"Since I had all the facts in hand," he said. <#/>"It was very easy for me to write t
he book. <#/>It took me only six months to complete the manuscript. <#/>But getting sponsors and other fiscal assistance took longer otherwise it would have had been out in 1980." 
\par <#/>Lyogello, who recently graduated with a diploma in marketing from the M
arketing Chartered Institute of Marketing UK, said his knowledge in wildlife, the basic writing skills from the ICS course plus the marketing course have helped him a lot in promoting his self-promoted book. 
\par <#/>"We have a lot of writers in Tanzania but i
n one way or the other they are being discouraged in the financial aspect and the manipulation of publishers who pay you not more than 10 per cent of your work without regard of the time, energy and resources you have consumed," he said bitterly. 
\par <#/>Lyogello, who is presently working on another book on Zanzibar island, also added that it was high time the government looked into the publishing industry so that more books get written for the benefit of the present and future generations. 
\par <#/>Essay writing, which was Lyogello's pro-occupation when he was schooling at the St. Thomas More College (now Ihungo Secondary School) in Bukoba where he completed his "A" levels in 1970, had also played a big part in arousing his writing interests. 

\par <#/>Married and with
 two sons and a daughter, Lyogello is very upset that all his books had to do with manually done illustrations. <#/>"They could have done with real <-_grossy><+_glossy> photos like they do overseas but since sponsors are short coming there is nothing I ca
n do about it," he said. 
\par <#/>The 16 maps and the 88 illustrations in the book which is bound in a black, orange and green jacket, have been drawn by Peter P. Ndembo and Angela Adye (illustrations) and maps by Costa Mahuwi. <#/>The layout was done by Sarah Bryan. </I>

\par }{\fs24 <#/>Miriam Makeba: One of only a handful of African musicians to be internationally acclaimed outside the continent, she became a roving ambassador for Black Africa. 
\par <#/>Behind the almost fairy tale show business success story, which whisked Miriam Makeba from a township singing group to international celebrity, lies <-_in> an epic tragedy of misfortune, injustice, bereavement, divorce, sickness, expulsion and exi
le. <#/>As she revealed in her auto-biography, a book titled }{\i\fs24 A Lethal Spiritual Madness}{\fs24 , released after her triumphant return to her country after years of exile }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
. <#/>Now, in the wake of apartheid erudication and a new South African government in place, she still lives to recount her tale. <#/>This is her story:
\par THE best known of the country's many artistic exiles has been a woman called }{\b\fs24 Mama Africa}{\fs24  or the }{\b\fs24 'Empress of African Music'}{\fs24 . <#/>But the name her mother bestowed on Miriam Makeba was Zenzi. 
\par <#/>The name from the }{\b\fs24 Xhosa}{\fs24  dialect, is derived from the root word <afr/>}{\i\fs24 Uzenzile,}{\fs24  Xhosa for 'you have no one to blame but yourself'. <#/>It seems }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 harsh sentence and in retrospect, an unfair judgement to pass on a woman who has endured so much personal suffering in a career lasting more than 30 years. 
\par <#/>She has brought joy to millions throughout the world, hope and pride to those 'exiled' within South Africa. 
\par <#/>One of only a handful of African musicians to be internationally acclaimed outside the continent, Makeba became a roving ambassador for Black Africa, following the revocation of her passport by the white minority South African government in 1959. 

\par <#/>Since then, her undeniable talent has been rewarded with a sparkling show busin
ess career. <#/>For 3 decades, she had been a figure-head for the struggle to liberate "the concentration camp which I escaped, but which is my home", Makeba recounts in the opening chapters of her own sad and often soul wrenching biography. 
\par <#/>She has never been far from controversy and counter-propaganda. <#/>Her marriage to the American political activist }{\b\fs24 Kwame Toure}{\fs24 
 (Stockley Carmichael) left the lingering insinuation that she was a racist, a charge she <-_patiently><+_patently> denied, and also denies further in the auto-biography. 
\par <#/>"People have accused me of being a racist, but I am just a person for justice and humanity. <#/>People say I sing politics, but what I sing is not politics, it is the truth"
\par Her ability to continue the beauty and pain of that personal truth, is what makes her auto-biography a masterpiece and another expression of her deep commitment and integrity. 
\par <#/>Her personal testimony, drives the message further to the ground that she's still one of the truly legendary performers, who took part in all of it, not just a witness. 
\par <#/>}{\b\fs24 <h> Apartheid </h>
\par }{\fs24 <#/>Her life was peopled with glamorous and powerful figures, and set about }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24  a background of international incident. 
\par <#/>Born into a stable township family in 1932, Miriam's
 problems according to her biography, began when she was young with the death of her father. <#/>Forced to find work, she quickly discovered music was a type of magic that would lift her out of the house-maid's drudgery. 
\par <#/>Even as a young schoolgirl, he
r singing achievements brought disappointment. <#/>Chosen by her school to sing for the visit of King George VI, she waited in the rain, only for him to drive by without stopping. <#/>The song she would have sung was titled }{\i\fs24 
What a Sad life for a Black Man}{\fs24 . 
\par <#/>When apartheid was introduced in South Africa, Makeba was just 15 years old, but old enough to grasp the consequences of that legislative obscenity. <#/>At 17, shortly after giving birth to Bongi, her first child, she was diagnosed to have cancer of 
the breast. <#/>Her first of five husbands deserted her soon after. 
\par <#/>Her singing career progressed smoothly, performing Jazz standards and <afr/>}{\i\fs24 Kwela}{\fs24  melodies in township bars, first with the }{\i\fs24 Cuban Brothers}{\fs24  then the }{\i\fs24 Manhattan Brothers}{\fs24 , with whom she t
oured Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia) and Zaire (then Leopoldville). 
\par <#/>While touring with them, she also experienced some of the most callous aspects of the apartheid system. <#/>Trying to find help for group members fatally injured in a road accident, the rac
ist government hospital had refused to intern the wounded musicians }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 . 
\par <#/>Two of them died out of neglect, after they were left to bleed profusely, before an awe-stricken Makeba who couldn't do anything but watch. <#/>According to the book, thi
s was only one of her many shocking experiences she had to endure (some of which I've chosen to ignore) }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24  
\par The key to her international success was a small singing part in the film }{\i\fs24 Come Back Africa}{\fs24 . <#/>Invited <-_at><+_to> the show at }{\b\fs24 Cannes Film Festival}{\fs24 
, Makeba became an instant celebrity. <#/>She was soon in New York, singing on Television and at the }{\i\fs24 Village Vanguard Jazz Club}{\fs24 
. <#/>Staggering for the wide-eyed new comer, she was also within days performing at the birthday party for President }{\b\fs24 John Fitzgerald Kennedy. 
\par <#/><h> Guidance </h<
\par }{\fs24 <#/>Under the guidance of her new-found friend, }{\b\fs24 Harry Belafonte}{\fs24 , Makeba released a string of memorable recordings including the epic song "<afr/>Malaika" and her follow-up click song "<afr_>Pata Pata<afr/>\'94, whi
ch have remained the basis of her repertoire. 
\par <#/>When her mother died in 1960, Makeba discovered her South African passport <-_has><+_had> been cancelled, preventing her to return }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  home for the funeral. 
\par <#/>From then on, until her triumphant return 30 years later, she was an exile from her own land. <#/>But even in the USA, her adopted country, turned <-_it's><+_its> back on her }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  when she married Stockley Carmichael. 

\par <#/>But Africa has never rejected Makeba for once, as well as performing for the many independence celebrations, she has collected a sheaf of diplomatic passports. <#/>She became a friend and confidante of late Guinean President }{\b\fs24 Sekou Toure}{
\fs24 , where she found refuge. 
\par <#/>Business life also had <-_it's><+_its> problems for Makeba. <#/>During the 60s, for example, she played often in Denmark. 
\par <#/>But on one occasion failed to appear for her show }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 . <#/>On returning to the country some years later, she was held and actually jailed until a financial penalty had been extracted. 
\par <#/>In East Africa during the 70s, she ran into further controversy surrounding the classic song "<afr/>Malaika". 
\par <#/>First thought to be traditionally hers, and later claimed by song writers, including a Tanzanian Adam Salim who still maintains to date the authorship of the epic song }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 . 
\par <#/>"I had written that song for my girl, Halima, that's the }{\i\fs24 angel}{\fs24  I was talking about. <#/>At that time I didn't know anything about creativity nor royalties. <#/>When I heard Williams singing it,
 I thought hey! <#/>This is my song! <#/>I had tried to make them understand, but having no money, just like the guy I am in the song, I just couldn't do more". <#/>}{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24  Salim told the }{\i\fs24 Sunday News}{\fs24 
 in November 1991. 
\par <#/>More recently, before returning to South Africa, confusion surrounded her participation in Paul Simon's }{\i\fs24 Graceland Tour}{\fs24 . 
\par <#/>A conflict of opinions on the cultural boycott of South Africa saw the supreme irony of ANC supporters in London picketing a Makeba performance. <#/>In fact, she 
says in her book, they were picketing Simon, who had professed ignorance of any such boycott, but Miriam Makeba and Hugh Masekela were only lending support. 
\par <#/>Two years later, she was touring the world with a Graceland review. <#/>She had obviously had a change of heart, didn't she? 
\par }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24 As mystic as herself, the auto-biography doesn't mention anything at all about <afr/>}{\b\fs24 Sarafina}{\fs24 
 (The sound of freedom), the internationally acclaimed musical about a group of children who changed the course of South Africa. 
\par <#/>In the movie, alongside Academy Award winning actress }{\b\fs24 Whoopi Goldberg}{\fs24 , Makeba plays Angelina (Sarafina's naive mother) who hasn't come to terms with the feelings of her people and above all, her own daughter Sarafina (played by }{
\b\fs24 Leleti Khumalo}{\fs24 )
\par The movie based in Soweto, sees a new opening for a group of young students whose extraordinary teacher Mary Masambuga (played by Goldberg), defies the authorities and dares to teach the students ideas not found in approved textbooks. 
\par <#/>Inspired to take their pride in themselves and their heritage, they form themselves into the school children's resistance movement. <#/>The organisation whose participation in the 1976 Soweto riots, would eventually lead to the release of }{\b\fs24 
Nelson Mandela}{\fs24  and the gradual dismantling of apartheid }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 . 
\par <#/>}{\b\fs24 <h> Legacy </h>
\par }{\fs24 <#/>The movie, not only was a broadway hit by director }{\b\fs24 Darell James Roodt}{\fs24 , but lifted Makeba even higher at a very late age, and brought her back front stage once again in full throttle. 
\par <#/>Always smart
er to capture the fine moments, Makeba rarely misses a chance to sing, she breaks into a five-minute song "Thank You" before the closing rounds of the movie. <#/>Since her <-/single minded> concern has been the liberation of her country, perhaps she didn'
t see fit that <-/mentioing> the movie, in her auto, was anything to rave about now (my opinion) since things have changed. 
\par <#/>Makeba's integrity has never been in doubt, she believed that }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24  Propaganda value of music should be utilised. <#/>Throughout the years she has <-/doubtlessly> proved it, and now through her book }{\i\fs24 A Lethal}{\fs24 
 }{\i\fs24 Spiritual Madness}{\fs24 , she lives to tell her almost sad tale, she lives to pardon, she lives to forget, she lives to teach and she lives to see another day. 
\par <#/>But Africa will always remember her, years after she has gone. <#/>That, her voice and her presence, were one of her most powerful weapons. 
\par <#/>This is the legacy the continent ought to learn, teach our children, so that our children could pass it on to their children, and their children's children. <#/>For the title \lquote

{\b\fs24 Samba Makalai}{\fs24 , an old OSS veteran, who laid all guitar tracks, structured and lined-up the menu for Kasheba to eat, and the latter ended up having all the credit. 
\par <#/>But with the new rise of alternative rock-jazz fusion (Tanzanian style) in the past few years, a new, decidedly unwanky style has been taking over, making Kasheba look a complete novice. 
\par <#/>}{\b\fs24 <h> Crazy </h>}{\fs24 
\par <#/>Raised on the necessity and a desire for new directions, the new guitar heroes have no time for indulgent solos or macho posturing, they are busily going crazy.

 Mgoro Mohamed and Farahani Mzee are the current gods of the movement. <#/>Mgoro because he's the most melodic and eloquent guitarist that the country has yet produced. <#/>Mzee, because he's the most audacious and lives up to it. 
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24 <#/>The guitar pair scrunch and distort the six-string devil, making it emit specialized, unexpected memories and progressions like in their current "<ea/>Tusameheane" and "<ea/>Rehema", all Mgoro's compositions.
\par Guitar nooding may not be dead, but for now it\rquote s been displaced. "The thing is that, it\rquote s fun to do it if you\rquote re a guitarist", says Farahani Mzee.
\par Unlike Mgoro, Mzee actually admits the blues explosion in their popular vibes, "I can\rquote t help it, I'm excited to be part of the blues explosion. And I prefer callin
g it blues rather than a Jazz misnomer. I gotta let everybody know". He said candidly.
\par "That\rquote s what led to all the overblown lead wanking of the 60s and the 70s. Most Tanzanian artists are absolutely marvellous, but they\rquote ve been shadowed by the hostile mus
ic industry and the radios that cater largely on foreign sounds, giving the local musician a raw deal". He observed.
\par He also complimented the decision by }{\b\v\fs24 Radio One}{\v\fs24  to dedicate two weekly programs entirely on Tanzanian music.
\par "This will bring back the spirit of old. And it shows at least there\rquote s someone somewhere, who cares for the country\rquote s musicians. It\rquote s a great step from the days we used to only have the muckier end of the stick", he added.
\par Lack of adequate musical knowledge, had led to glofirication of this wanky style from Zaire, said Mzee, but the fans have discovered that the real honky-tonky stuff is right here for the take. All you need to do is reach out and collect.
\par Mzee recaptures the scene with a smile,
\par "All of a sudden, a generation woke up and said, \'82well maybe fun to do, but we <slang}{\b\v\fs24 />}{\v\fs24 wanna listen to Msondo, Paselepa, Sikinde' it was like they were saying, <-/"wev\rquote 
e> had enough of this foreign music pollution, besides, it\rquote s a <-/f....g> bore!"
\par }{\b\v\fs24 <h> Explosion </h>
\par }{\v\fs24 The }{\b\v\fs24 Mwenge Jazz}{\v\fs24  blues explosion seems built for iconoclasm. The front piece line-up includes Mabruck Mohamed, Fred Siame, Hassan Shaaban, Hassan Sangali and Hussein Mtamile on vocals.
\par Mgoro himself, Mzee and }{\b\v\fs24 Francis John Tembo}{\v\fs24  on lead solo. }{\b\v\fs24 Abdul Moreya}{\v\fs24  on drums, }{\b\v\fs24 Bakari Kubo}{\v\fs24  on saxophone and }{\b\v\fs24 January Sanane, Ismail Issa}{\v\fs24  and }{\b\v\fs24 Bengwe Simbi}{
\v\fs24  horning the trumpets.
\par Mgoro, himself a multi-instrumentalist, would do a couple of swings from rhythm guitar, solo and back to bass, alongside }{\b\v\fs24 Mustafa Bomboko}{\v\fs24 , their ace bassist.
\par Mgoro borrows from the same blues sources, }{\b\v\fs24 Muddy Waters, B.B.King}{\v\fs24 , that led to all those rock excesses. But instead of mimicking the genre, Mgoro tries to add some punk.
\par Citing George Benson and Eric Clapton as sources and influences, he comes up with a sound that\rquote s brash, funky and impossibly groovy. Listen to him do "<ea_>Nimefanya Utafiti<ea/>" or "<ea_>Sani Mjukuu Wangu<ea/>\rdblquote .
\par Although Mgoro\rquote s guitar is primitive, but it is intuitive, like <-_Mwinshehes><+_Mwinshehe's>, he hits it when he 'feels it'.
\par Mgoro\rquote s voice is the sound of someone who just can\rquote t contain himself when he bellows out, "<ea_>Mama Musa<ea/>!" It\rquote s the most lascivious sentiment since "Maudhi", where Mgoro pitched his wang-dang-doodle like nobody did before.

\par Trained in a Police Academy in Moshi, CCP, by a British schooled guitarist, }{\b\v\fs24 Boniface Musiba}{\v\fs24 , Mgoro acquired rockjazz improvisations, which rubbed off during the Europe an tenure of this trainer.
\par Thrown into the music business at a tender age of nine, Mgoro saw himself progressing to a teen act group <ea/>}{\i\v\fs24 Jambo Stars}{\v\fs24 . In a decade, he had joined the Tanga-based }{\i\v\fs24 Atomic Jazz}{\v\fs24 
 as a bassist, before coming back to the capital and teaming up with his current }{\b\v\fs24 Mwenge Jazz}{\v\fs24 .
\par Perhaps the highest point in his musical career came in 1977, during the birth of the CCM, after the merging of ASP and TANU.
\par The government had asked musicians to compose a song for the grand launching, in support of the decision. Always with something up his musical sleeve, Mgoro had coined the famous and popular party song "<ea_>Chama chetu cha mapinduzi chajenga nchi<ea/>
\rdblquote , to be adopted as a party slogan since, to his utter amazement.
