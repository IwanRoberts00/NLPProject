\par <I> <h> LITERATURE REVIEW </h>
\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 2.0 Introduction.</h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 This chapter presents the 
literature review. <#/>It reviews the various studies on women and infant mortality in several countries and Tanzania in particular. <#/>In addition, it reveals the weaknesses of these studies and points out what has not been done. <#/>The chapter also sh
ows the conceptual framework for the analysis of infant mortality in the study.
\par <#/><-/Far-less> is known in Third World countries about the <-/behavioral> and social determinants of infant mortality than about the biological ones. <#/>While the latter have
 been extensively studied, relatively little work has been done on the former. <#/>During the recent years there has been a growing awareness that this imbalance in our understanding of infant mortality needs to be redressed <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
(Gupta 1990)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>.
\par <#/>The determina
nts of infant mortality are divided into two main groups, socio-economic and proximate factors. <#/>Socio-economic factors includes education, income, residence, occupation, marital status, health, religion which work through the proximate determinants th
at is maternal factors, environmental contamination, nutrient deficiency and injury.
\par <#/><-_Women><+-Women\rquote s> health as one of the most important socio-economic determinants of infant mortality has not been dealt with adequately. <#/>The few findings have n
ot always been consistent. <#/>This might have been so because infant mortality is also influenced by other socio-cultural factors which differ from society to society. <#/>These factors include, nutrition, workload, antenatal and postnatal services, educ
ation, prevalence and common diseases and environmental conditions.
\par <#/>Women need adequate nourishment throughout their lives not only when they are pregnant. <#/>Undernourishment during childhood can lead to stunted growth and this will affect child birth
. <#/>Undernourishment and deficiencies of certain nutrients during woman's reproductive years are suspected of increasing her risk of infection or haemorrhage during pregnancy or delivery. <#/>In }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>orth}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{
\fs24\lang2057 Less Developed countries it has been found that twenty to <-/forty five> percent of women aged 15\_
44 do not consume enough calories each day. <#/>Children of undernourished women are likely to be born with low weight. <#/>Thus they have high risks to death <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Population Reports 1990)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>.
\par <#/>Literature on nut
rition in developing countries, and Tanzania in particular, prove that women nutritional status and that of their children is poor. <#/>Buvinic and Leslie (1981) asserted that the poor nutritional status of many women in Latin America and the Caribbean co
ntributed significantly to lowered resistance to diseases and lowered economic productivity. <#/>Anaemia among pregnant, lactating and even non\_pregnant women has long been recognised as a problem }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>sense}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{
\fs24\lang2057 than it is to men. <#/>This is due to low nutrient
 intake among women. <#/>Inadequate nutrition is also a major cause of infant births of low weight which accounts in part for the extremely high mortality rates in Latin America and the Caribbean. <#/>High infant mortality rates are striking among women u
nder the age of 20 years, the uneducated, those with five or more children and single mothers <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Buvinic & Leslie 1981)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>.
\par <#/>Another study was done in Tanzania by UNICEF (1985). <#/>The study aimed at finding out the causes of child death. <#/>The factors dea
lt with were nutrient intake and diseases. <#/>On nutrient intake, the survey showed that in most rural households in Tanzania the diet consisted of mainly one staple food (cereals) supplemented with beans or peas, green leafy vegetables and occasionally 
meat. <#/>They concluded that there was a deficit in the total food energy intake.
\par <#/>In a research by Yambi (1988) on nutritional status and the risk of death for the children of six to thirty months in Iringa region, it was noted that disease prevalence was a result of low nutrition. <#/>It was concluded 
\par that risk of death among children increased as nutritional status declined. <#/>Kokkonen's (1985) study in Iringa region aimed at finding out the effects of Finnish aid to the health sector and its effec
t on women health. <#/>The study was centred on incidence of diseases, workload and the nutritional status of women and children. <#/>On nutrition it was noted that maize was the main staple food for the villagers coupled with beans, vegetables like cassa
va leaves, cowpeas, cabbage and spinach.
\par <#/>The argument that women average energy intake (1700 calories) is low compared to average energy output (3500 calories) has been discussed by Lukmanji and Sepiten (1987). <#/>In their study they discovered reasons
 for such state of affair to be low feeding frequency (2 times a day), inadequate food ratios, lack of appropriate cooking facilities and equipment and low energy density foods.
\par <#/>This <-_result><+_results> in low weight gain, low milk output leading to poor feeding of infants and early malnutrition. <#/>The risk of an undernourished mother to produce an infant of low birth weight less than three kilograms is very high.
\par <#/>These underweight children have }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  high risk to }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  death.
\par <#/>The s
tudy on the relationship between eating patterns and the related health characteristics of their children in Morogoro region was done by Kahabuka in 1989. <#/>In that study it was observed that people ate a lot of plant foods and little of animal foods. <
#/>Thus less of essential nutrients and so children had low weight and growth generally.
\par <#/>Lomayani (1973) carried a study of Groups of Ujamaa villages in Dodoma district. <#/>She dealt with traditional ways of child rearing and upbringing and the impact 
of Ujamaa villages on the young child in terms of water, environmental sanitation and personal hygiene, care and attention for expecting and nursing mothers, care and attention of babies and young children, shortage of clothing and the handicapped childre
n
 in the sampled villages. <#/>It was found that the expecting and lactating mothers eat the same diet as the rest of the family, which in most cases, is of low nutrition. <#/>Children born to undernourished mothers are weak, undernourished and easily infe
cted by diseases.
\par <#/>All these studies have shown that, generally, women and children get low nutrition. <#/>However these studies did not specifically correlate the effect of the nutrient intake on women and infant health <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
(Lomayani 1973, UNICEF 1985, Kokkonen 1985)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>. <#/>Some scholars have emphasised on the nutrition of infants and children only without regard to women who are the determinants of nutrition in a household <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
(Lomayani 1973, Kahabuka 1986, Yambi 1988)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>. <#/>Lukmanji's and Sepiten's study (1987) was done at macro level the same is true with Buvinic's and Leslie's (1981) and UNICEF's (1985) studies.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 2.2 Workload </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 It is a well known fact that in many developing countries particularly in Af
rica, women have a heavy workload. <#/>Women are not only in charge of all domestic duties but also are engaged in the agricultural activities. <#/>A United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) study in 1974 estimated that women consisted betwee
n 60 to 70 percent of the labour force in African agriculture. <#/>The heavy work output is accompanied by fatigue, low food intake, inadequate rest, high infection rates especially malaria which is often associated with anaemia <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
(Lugeye and Karegeyo 1987)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>.
\par <#/>Studies on maternal performance have shown that women's workload during pregnancy, especially during the last months of pregnancy, is the major determinant of prenatal and early neonatal deaths. <#/>In three districts of Morogoro region it has been sh
own that women spend 14 to 16 hours a day on average on domestic work, agriculture, child care and for the rest of the family maintenance. <#/>In most cases the heavy work\_
output is often accompanied by low food intake, inadequate rest and high infection rates. <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Rutahakana & Kisanga 1987)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>.
\par <#/>Donovan (1987), in her paper presented in the 6th Annual Scientific Conference on Maternal and Child Health, Family Planning Monitoring and Evaluation, argues that the women's heavy workload, especially during the last
 months of pregnancy, is a major  determinant of early neonatal deaths. <#/>In another study in Iringa region, Kokkonen (1985) observed that women worked throughout the day from early morning to late evening.
\par <#/>It has keen estimated that women in Tanzani
a are  responsible for about 70 percent of food crop production; and they supply about 80 percent of the working hours (Meena 1989). <#/>Harvenick (1988) in Meena (1989) observed that while men's labour input in rural production is only 19 percent of the 
total, women's labour input is 70 percent
\par and the remaining is contributed by children.
\par <#/>Heavy workload causes loss of energy, leading to body weakness especially where the food supply is poor. <#/>Also it has an indirect effect on children as it leads to malnutrition due to inadequate time for child care and feeding by nursing mothers. <
#/>Rutahakana and Kisanga study (1987), proved that nutritional status of children in low income areas in Arusha improved with increased time on child care <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Rutahakana & Kisanga 1987)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>
. <#/>It has also been pointed out by UNICEF (1990) that areas of the coun
try with high levels of food crop production like Rukwa are also areas with high levels of child malnutrition. <#/>These are areas where the time of child caretakers, their mothers, may be most constrained. <#/>Insufficient time precludes their feeding yo
ung children frequently.
\par <#/>These studies on workload did not show daily activities done by women <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Rutahakana & Kisanga 1987)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>
. <#/>The researchers have also failed to reveal the direct cause of infant deaths which is the poor condition of the mother. <#/>It seems that all the scholars assume a direct relationship between workload and infant deaths which is not the case <X_>(}{
\v\fs24\lang2057 UNICEF 1985,1990, Lugeye and Karegeyo 1987, Donovan 1987)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>. Therefore, the relationship between workload, women health and infant mortality has not been dealt with adequately.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 2.3 Antenatal and Postpartum Care </h>
\par Antenatal care, that is care during pregnancy is recommended to start from the sixteenth week of pregnancy while postnatal/postpartum care begins before discharge to six we
eks after delivery. <#/>This reduces the risk of complications for mothers and profoundly influences the babies chance of survival during the first month of life. <#/>The care involves thorough and regular physical examination, attention to psychological 
considerations and hygiene teaching <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Brockington 1965)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>.
\par <#/>There are few studies on antenatal and postpartum care which have been carried in other parts of the world, and in Tanzania. <#/>Writings in the 'Population Reports' (1988), show that the undereduc
ated and rural women are likely to receive less prenatal care than their urban counterparts. <#/>These women often do not get prenatal care because it costs too much in terms of time and money. <#/>That is, they take a long time to walk to the nearest MCH
 
clinic and is expensive in terms of transport and services. <#/>It is said that women are more likely to use prenatal services when they are within 3 kilometres from their homes than if it is far. <#/>It is further argued that, generally women with tradit
ional life styles and those who deliver their first babies at home are not likely to use prenatal services and that many women see no need for prenatal care unless they have complications.
\par <#/>Wood (1973), writing on mother and child health, centred her stu
dy on delivery services, child health clinics, antenatal clinics, postnatal services and child spacing. <#/>She noted that the demand for antenatal services has been increasing in the last twenty years. <#/>But out of 75 percent of women who attended ante
n
atal care only 35 percent returned for delivery. <#/>So more than 50 percent of the women did not turn up for delivery. <#/>Wood also noted that postnatal care for mothers is virtually non existent except for those who have had complications during delive
ry. <#/>These patients might be asked to return for <-/checkups>. <#/>Postnatal care for mothers is missing because the facilities for examining women, a coach and privacy are not available.
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 <#/>Another study which was carried out in Iringa district by Mala
ngalila (1979) aimed at relating perinatal mortality to the age of the mother, parity and education level of the mother, marital status, place of delivery and number of visits to antenatal clinics. <#/>On antenatal care it was noted that there was a signi
f
icant fall in perinatal mortality in relation to the number of visits to antenatal clinics. <#/>For those with five or six visits the perinatal mortality rates were remarkably low. <#/>Thus decrease in perinatal mortality was associated with an increase i
n the number of visits to antenatal clinics.
\par \pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang1031 {\fs24\lang2057 
<#/>A survey done by Kimambo (1982) in Bagamoyo district on utilization of maternal and child health services showed that antenatal attendance was high but the percentage of women delivering under trained supervi
sion (in hospital) was low. <#/>It was also noted that postnatal attendance was high but this was for children and not mothers.
\par <#/>The researchers above have not shown how antenatal and postnatal care relate to <_-women><+-women\rquote s> health and infant mortality <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Wood 1973, Malangalila 1979, Population Reports 1988). <#/>

\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 To come to grips with the problem as to what Social Sciences are all about, let us, first all, begin with the title itself. <#/>The keyword in the title is }{\fs24\ul\lang2057 Science}{\fs24\lang2057  qualified by the adjective }{
\fs24\ul\lang2057 Social. <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The
 illuminating question here is; what is science? <#/>The answer to this question will make it clear as to whether the disciplines grouped under the title Social Sciences deserve to be called Science or not.
\par <#/>According to the Concise Oxford Dictionary, }{\v\fs24\lang2057 (1990 ed.) }{\fs24\lang2057 
Science is a branch of knowledge conducted on objective principles involving the systematized observation of and experiment with phenomena, esp. concerned with the material and functions of the physical universe. <#/>We are in the realm of natura
l or physical science, physics, chemistry, geology, biology, and botany.
\par <#/>Science is, therefore, knowledge obtained by observation and testing of facts. <#/>The pursuit of such knowledge is currently also called Science. <#/>The dictionary concludes by saying; }{\fs24\ul\lang2057 Science is an}{\fs24\lang2057  }{
\fs24\ul\lang2057 exact discipline}{\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>According to the Canadian Encyclopedia }{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Vol III)}{\fs24\lang2057 , science is the rational study of nature. <#/>Science is, therefore, rational. <#/>It uses reason. <#/>A rationalist may be defined as someone who believes in dedu
ctive logic. <#/>He accepts as true certain statements and then reasons from the general to the particular. <#/>As for example, all men are mortal, Mr. X, is a man, therefore he is also mortal. <#/>Deductive logic is a frequent source of hypotheses and a 
scientist tests the internal consistency of his theories by setting them up in deductive logic.
\par <#/>Science is empirical; it is based on experience, and not on speculation, or introspection. <#/>It does not accept self - evident axioms as a start in reasoning. <#/>The source of scientific knowledge is the actual experience.
\par <#/>Science is not subjective i.e based on the feelings of someone, no, it is based on empirical evidence. <#/>Its findings are public property; they are at the disposal of every one.
\par <#/
>Science is systematic. <#/>It proceeds by observing the <AmE/>behavior of some phenomena, then experiment follows to test the observed facts, and the theories formed on the basis of these facts. <#/>Hence science is experimental. <#/>It specifies its con
ditions of observation.
\par <#/>The classical design for a scientific experiment identifies three types of variables: the dependent, the independent, and the constant. <#/>Science is quantitative, it counts and measures what it studies. <#/>Science is self - co
rrective - it requires no other authority than itself to correct it. <#/>The goal of science is prediction and control. <#/>Science aims to understand and explain natural phenomena.
\par <#/>The assumptions of science are, (1) Determinism, or natural causation.
 <#/>Events are determined by certain factors, they do not just happen. <#/>Science does not accept chance as an explanation of an occurrence; (2) Finite causation means that the causes of an event are limited in number, they are not infinite, but finite;
 (3) The law of parsimony, the assertion that no more causes, or forces should be assumed than are necessary to account for the facts. <#/>The Romans used to say; <quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 <Latin_>}{\v\fs24\ul\lang2057 
Entia non sunt multiplicanda sine necessitate<Latin}{\v\fs24\lang2057 />}{\fs24\lang2057 </X><quote/>}{\fs24\ul\lang2057 
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Let us now consider the word }{\fs24\ul\lang2057 Social}{\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>To begin with, the word social is derived from the Latin <Latin/>}{\fs24\ul\lang2057 socius}{\fs24\lang2057 
, meaning companion, a person with whom one has some close relationship. <#/>Social, therefore, refers to people living in communities, and their interactions, thus, we have }{\fs24\ul\lang2057 social}{\fs24\lang2057 
 organisations, social problems, social class, social stratification, etc. <#/>In short, the term social refers to any human <AmE/>behavior which is influenced by past, or present experiences of the <AmE/>behavior of other people.
\par <
#/>Social is sometimes used to imply an awareness of the feelings and attitudes of others; as for example, we say so-and-so is very social, sociable, that is he cares for other people's point of view, and <-/welbeing>, a political leader should be social 
to his people. <#/>He should cultivate their social welfare.
\par <#/>The term social is often given a moral connotation, implying action directed toward the welfare of others, e.g. }{\fs24\ul\lang2057 Social Security}{\fs24\lang2057 , }{\fs24\ul\lang2057 Social Work}{\fs24\lang2057 , }{\fs24\ul\lang2057 Social Welfare,
}{\fs24\lang2057  Again the word Social is used to denote a special study of people in a special perspective, e.g. Social Psychology, Social Anthropology, Social Gerontology, etc.
\par <#/>Social is sometimes confused with cultural. <#/>We have seen that }{\fs24\ul\lang2057 Social}{\fs24\lang2057  refers to interaction between a group of people, wh
ile cultural stresses the normative and cognitive patterns for action, rather than interaction itself. <#/>This point will become clear when the two words, society (social) and culture (cultural) will be discussed below, <Latin_>}{\fs24\ul\lang2057 
loco suo}{\fs24\lang2057 <Latin/>. <#/>(things should not be multiplied without a need); (4) Necessity of approximation, that is near to the actual.
\par <#/>}{\fs24\ul\lang2057 Homo Sapiens}{\fs24\lang2057  has always been curious about his nature, the factors which influence his decisions and <AmE/>behavior. <#/>Likewise, he has constantl
y sought to understand the physical world around him, and the causes of events.
\par <#/>In course of time, man conceived a theory of human <AmE/>behavior which guided all his social, political, economic and religious activities. <#/>Underlying all human actions, }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>orth}{\fs24\lang2057 
 homo sapiens discovered that there was a system of beliefs, opinions and attitudes concerning what his nature was, what he could do, what he ought to do, and what he could not do.
\par <#/>This system of beliefs etc. is a function of one's cultural 
heritage and it reflects the social and economic background, education, and social life as a whole This system has a great impact on human <AmE/>behavior. <#/>It influences both how we act and how we relate to others, the expectations we have of them, how
 we socialize our children and how we order our entire public and private life. <#/>This point will be explained fully when discussing culture under anthropology below.
\par <#/>Social Sciences are all about human <AmE/>behavior and the factors which account for it. <#/>Human conduct can be explained from many points of view. <#/>Philosophers, theologians, poets and artists have all contributed to the understanding of human <
AmE/>behavior.
\par <#/>Inspired by the success of the physical science which had made such strides in explaining the physical world, the social scientists adopted the methods of natural science and applied them to the study of human <AmE/>behavior. <#/>This mov
e, however, is recent. <#/>Below is a brief account of man's attempts at explanation of his conduct.
\par <#/>Belief in magic as an explanation of social events dominated the entire humanity until the advent of the age of reason and science about the 19th centu
ry. <#/>The Greek Philosophers and the ancient <-/Egyptions> are an exception for they speculated and concluded that the position of the stars at the time of one's birth determined the course of his, or her life. <#/>This was the beginning of astrology (A
rt of studying the stars in the belief that they <-/influnce> human affairs).
\par <#/>Since that time astrology has become a booming business. <#/>The notion of fate developed from astrology. <#/>Fate is by nature pessimistic; man can do little to avoid what fate has in store for him. <#/>The Swahili say. <#/>}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 
<&/>punct}{\fs24\lang2057  "<ea_>}{\fs24\ul\lang2057 Ajali haina Kinga<ea/>}{\fs24\lang2057 \rdblquote , <-/litterally>, accident is unavoidable, it is predetermined, man is powerless, he can't change the course of events.
\par <#/>Fate is an essential part of astrology. <#/>All in all, astrology was better than animism and speculation because it recognised a regularity to human <AmE/>behavior from natural causes, i.e. the movement of the stars.
\par <#/>Critically appraised, astrology is socially fallacious. <#/>How the movement 
of the stars influence human <AmE/>behavior is only stated but no proof is given. <#/>So astrology, despite the fact that it was an improvement over animism and mythology, as a theory of <AmE/>behavior, it is scientifically untenable.
\par <#/>The Greek philoso
phers explained human <AmE/>behavior by analyzing man as a dichotomy of body and soul (mind and will) body (drives). <#/>Drives are blind, they belong to the body, while mind is a thinking capacity, able to weigh <-/prons> and cons, and come to a right de
cision to act or not to act. <#/>In this vein, Socrates said, only ignorant people can
\par commit crimes, philosophers do not misbehave, because, they know. <#/>As a legacy from him, we all tend to believe that educated people cannot misbehave. <#/>It was a sca
ndal one time, when a doctor was convicted of adultery with his female patient in one hospital. <#/>People were alarmed to hear of it. <#/>How can an educated man do that, people remarked.
\par <#/>Until the 19th century the study of man and society was largely
 deductive in approach and given to system building. <#/>These systems were <AmE/>modeled on ideas from theology or from the emerging physical sciences and generally had a powerful normative and 
\par prescriptive content. <#/>The few individuals involved in these speculative enterprises had no clear cut professional identity.
\par <#/>As the 19th century progressed emphasis switched to the gathering of data which would, when properly analyzed, provide useful information. <#/>Thus was born the positivistic approach to the social sciences.
\par <#/>The number of people engaged in the study of society grew considerably and disciplinary lines emerged. <#/>German universities, from which American universities borrowed heavily, had a strong impact on these developments. <#/>Dep
artments specializing in history, sociology, political science, etc. emerged towards the end of the 19th century.
\par <#/>A measure of the increasing specialization in the social sciences was reflected in the professional organizations, the American Historical
 Association 1884; the American Economics Association 1885; the American Psychological Association 1892; the American Sociological Association 1895; the American Anthropological Association 1902; and the American Political Association 1903. <#/>These bodi
e

\par <#/>There is hardly a social, economic or political problem that social scientists have not tackled and suggested solution. <#/>Problems
 such as marital conflicts, clashes of interests in industrial relations, students unrest, etc. are analysed using the social science research method, in short the social sciences have become an indispensable source of guidance for administrators and prof

\par <I> <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 Conclusions and Policy Implications </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The foregoing review, based on the data and research literature on the various levels and subsectors of education in the subregion in the course of the last two decades, leads to a few conclusions - general and specific.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 General </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 In genera
l, the overall performance in the subregion as a whole has not been very satisfactory, with a preponderance of low performance ratings as compared to positive or average ratings. <#/>In particular, performance has been less satisfactory in four of the six
 areas examined, namely in primary education, science education, vocational-technical training and medium of instruction. <#/>It has been generally satisfactory in higher education and average in secondary education.
\par <#/>These qualitative ratings of 'satisfactory' (or higher performance), 'average' and 'less satisfactory' (or lower performance) relate strictly to the extent to which }{\fs24\ul\lang2057 practice}{\fs24\lang2057  has kept pace or consistency with }{
\fs24\ul\lang2057 policy objectives}{\fs24\lang2057  and/or the extent to which policy shifts over time have kept pace 
or consistency with the development aspirations as expressed in various popular or else representative fora of expertise. <#/>The ratings thus relate more to qualitative improvements and less to mere quantitative statistics, as in the case of expansionary
 enrolments without corresponding qualitative changes or backups.
\par <#/>Table 8.1, standing on the strength of the above mentioned qualitative definition, summarizes the overall evaluation as emerges from the review of the six areas representing the levels and subsectors under study.
\par <#/>Performance by individual countries with respect to the totality of the areas surveyed varies, as demonstrated in Table 8.2, with Botswana seeming to have done the best of all the sample countries overall, with higher performa
nce ratings in four of the six areas, an average rating in one area and a lower performance rating in one area. <#/>Botswana is followed by Lesotho (with 3v, 1vx, 2x), Swaziland (with 3v, 3x) and Kenya (with 2v, 2vx, 2x), while the other four countries, n
amely Zambia (1v, 2vx, 3x), Tanzania (1v, 2vx, 3x), Uganda (1v, 3x, 2?) and Malawi (1v, 1vx, 4x), have tended to gravitate towards lower performance.
\par [...]
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 If the qualitative judgements were to be given numeric values, both the analyses of the separate 
levels and subsectors for the whole subregional sample and the analyses of individual <-/cuntries> by their six areas of review would yield a generally similar rating pattern, with a statistically indicative (though in no way politically judgemental) rank
ing order. <#/>Table 8.3 attempts such a numeric translation of the qualitative statements, with higher performance (or satisfactory) awarded 10, average 5 and lower performance (or less satisfactory) awarded 1.
\par <#/>Of the subregion's six areas of review, h
igher education scores the highest total of numeric points (80), with a corresponding highest average numeric score (10). <#/>Higher education is followed in performance by secondary education (7.14, some points above average), primary education (4.88, ju
st below average), vocational-technical training (3.75, well below average), science education (2.14, far below average) and language medium of instruction (1.5, very far below average).
\par <#/>With respect to performance by individual members of the sample gr
ouping, according to Table 8.3, Botswana comes out with the highest average score (7.67, well above average), followed by Lesotho (6.17, some way above average). <#/>Swaziland and Kenya are just above average, with 5.50 and 5.33, respectively. <#/>The oth
e
r four countries, Tanzania (3.83), Zambia (3.83), Uganda (3.25) and Malawi (3.17), all have their scores well below average. <#/>The general interpretation is that while these latter four countries have lagged behind the others in overall educational deve
lopment, they have, at least hypothetically, performed below average.
\par <#/>The simple statistical aid used to arrive at some more detailed synthesis, and at some ranking order, does at the same time point to a cautionary note. <#/>It is apparent that even th
e first and the second countries on the ranking scale fall short of the best possible level of performance in the totality of the different areas of education examined. <#/>Their positions in the ranking scheme cannot, therefore, be cause for complacency 
a
nd reduced national effort. <#/>Notwithstanding the caution sounded, however, the relatively widely differentiated numeric scores and ranking of these and other countries under study may help further in the discussion of interlinkage of factors and proces
ses in the wider national economy.
\par <#/>Curiously, but perhaps not altogether just coincidentally, the general order of the ratings and ranking (as indicated in Table 8.3) appears to have roughly parallel resemblance with the general order of ratings elsewhe
re in some vital sectors of the economy. <#/>A specific example is the rate of production (ref Table 1.1), which is itself considered a proxy for productivity at least insofar as a heightened production of goods and services may be a measure of workers' k
n
owledge, skill and performance. <#/>While, for all the countries of the sample grouping except Lesotho, the rate of production (GDP) has declined over the past two decades, it has unequivocally been the highest in Botswana. <#/>On average, for the whole t
wenty year period of 1965-84, Botswana has been followed in the rate of production by Kenya and Swaziland, while, for the latter decade of 1973-83/84 it is followed by Lesotho, Kenya and Swaziland.
\par <#/>The same "top-ranging" countries happen to have a disti
nctively higher level of income (cf. GNP per capita for Botswana - US$840, Swaziland - $790, Lesotho - $530, Kenya - $316, as contrasted from that of Malawi - $180, Uganda - $230, Tanzania - $250 and Zambia - $300) and a higher average annual per capita i
ncome growth over the whole two-decade period (cf. Botswana: 8.8%, Lesotho: 5.9%, Swaziland: 4.0% and Kenya: 1.9%, as contrasted, for instance, from Uganda's -2.9%, Zambia's -1.7% and Tanzania's -0.3%).
\par <#/>Again, three of the four "top-ranging" countries h
appen to record the highest known proportion of their state expenditure on education (Kenya: 20%, Botswana: 18% and Lesotho: 17%), as contrasted from Tanzania's extreme case of a mere 7%, or about 13 per cent in Uganda and in Malawi.
\par <#/>It does seem that 
even if allowance were made for several intervening factors or variables or the rate of production, such as the amount of initial resources and capital base, ecology, health care or international trade relations, still the final product is to some extent 
a
 reflection of the efficiency of a country's education system, the intensity and manner of its human resource development and deployment strategies and the internal and external efficiency of its skill training programmes, including vocational-technical t
r
aining and science education. <#/>These education-related factors are, in the short or long run, bound to influence the rate of economic-material production, which, in turn, would have a direct influence not only on the rate of individual and national pro
d
uctivity but also on the tempo of income generation as well as on the level of income itself. <#/>As things are at the moment, only three countries (Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland) seem to have a consistently high score on all the three levels of formal 
education; only two countries (Botswana and Kenya) have a high score on vocational-technical training; and only two countries (Botswana and Zambia) reach an <-/averatge> score in science education.
\par <#/>The rest of this chapter summarizes the conclusions and the policy implications with respect to each of the six areas of the review.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Primary Education </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Development in primary education in eastern and southern Africa has been reflected in an <-/undisputably> quantitative expansion in pupil enro
lment rates. <#/>Expansion in any other terms backup educational equipment, textbooks, supplementary reading material for pupils, and teacher supply - has been minimal in spite of some innovative but largely defective stop-gap measures. <#/>In some cases 
the expansion has in fact been negative if only in proportion to the explosive enrolment rates in the wake of the universal primary education (UPE) drive characterizing the whole decade of the 1970s/80s.
\par <#/>The whole post-independence period under review is thus seen to have been a period of expansion much more in quantitative terms and much less in qualitative terms. <#/>Problems of quality are discerned in the internal inefficiency reported in almost a
ll countries under review: <-/inoptimally> high pupil-teacher ratios, hasty and inadequate teacher training programmes resulting in poor teacher classroom performance, and crowded curricula made worse by dire shortages of teaching-learning materials.

\par <#/>At
 the end of the primary education cycle, according to most of the reviewed literature, most children show a conspicuous level of underachievement bordering, in some cases, on wholesale illiteracy. <#/>Yet, their hopes and aspirations (just as their own pa
r
ents') are further frustrated by the little chance they have of either advancing to secondary level education, or proceeding to some post-primary vocational training, or simply being absorbed into the social economy as gainfully employed individuals in th
e community. <#/>These, too, are sad issues related to the external efficiency of an education system.
\par <#/>Of the eight countries of the study sample, Malawi and Tanzania seem to have experienced problems of primary education the most, followed by Zambia and Kenya.
\par <#/>Implications for future policy towards primary education are fairly clear.
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 1. Quality versus Quantity </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 It is essential now for governments to de-emphasize and decelerate quantitative expansion as seen in inflationary pupil enr
olment and, instead, to stress and pursue the quality side of primary education. <#/>Availability and efficient distribution of school equipment, textbooks, teaching-learning aids and supplementary readers should now be the objective; for, indeed, these h
ave much more to say for a person's fuller learning than mere attendance in a classroom that had no chalk, books, aids or even desks for the day's lesson.
\par <#/>While the country's primary school system should remain open to receive beginners, it should at th
e same time remain an open option for the parent to apply for the admission of the child. <#/>Parents have a propensity to send children to school - even to pay for their education - when they have trust in the school. <#/>Public trust and confidence in t
he schools will depend on how equipped they are to impart permanent <-_learnings><+_learning> in the children.
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 2. Streamlining and Rationalizing the Primary School Curriculum </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 There should be a reversal of the current tendency to overload t
he curriculum with so many subjects which, in the end, reduce the time period devoted or devotable to any specific subject while also reducing the interconnectedness of the subject matter and the transferability of basic concepts. <#/>This point argues fo
r
 a core curriculum, based on a careful determination and selection of "central" subjects and subject areas that are accepted as basic or <-/foundational> for the learning and perceptive scope consonant with the age levels circumscribed by the limited prim
ary education cycle.
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 3. Reforming and Strengthening the Teacher Training Programme </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Teacher training programmes directed at producing primary school teachers deserve serious attention to matters ranging from selection of candidates, to acad
emic abilities in the subjects for which they are to be trained to teach, to duration of training.
\par <#/>With particular regard to candidates, selection of "failed" primary or secondary school leavers for the teaching profession as has been the case in some 
countries, has undermined and would continue to undermine not only the efficiency but also the status and respectability of the teaching profession itself. <#/>And, in any case, training a primary school leaver for teaching a primary school child is itsel
f
 of questionable merit, allowable only in special and extenuating circumstances. <#/>Similarly, the stop-gap measure - elsewhere defended as an innovative shortcut of "distance teacher training" has revealed not only inherent organizational and profession
al weaknesses but also larger unintended costs of retraining and reorientation.
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 4. Increased Public Financing of Primary Education </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The government ought to step up the current level of financing of primary education in order to meet the req
uired material and pedagogical standards of basic education. <#/>This view is in recognition of the logic that primary education is a foundation level beyond which - at least for the foreseeable future in many countries in the subregion and in the region 
a
s a whole - a still greater proportion of the population will not have a formal opportunity for advanced learning. <#/>It is imperative therefore that the education offered at this basic level must receive all the physical, material, intellectual and prof
essional supports possible for a permanent functionality of the future citizens.
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Indeed, a stepped-up level of public financing should be possible and easier as governmental financial commitment in higher, especially university, education could be stepp
ed down in invitation to private sector participation in cost-sharing by parents, students and non\-governmental institutions (see Higher Education).
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Recently developed countries like Japan and Norway have succeeded in this area largely because of an early and consistent decision to invest heavily in quality education at elementary (primary) level. }{\v <#/>}{
\v\fs24\lang2057 The argument has been that any gaps and deficiencies at this early stage would undermine learning and mastery at all the subsequent levels. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 At the sam
e time, higher, especially university education and especially in Japan, is paid for not directly by the state but by parents (through cash fees payment), students (through loan systems with government and/or financial institutions) and industry, companie
s and firms (through charity, trust funds and/or contract research-and-development projects).
\par <h> }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Secondary Education </h>
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 With an overriding concern for indigenous high-level manpower development, secondary education has enjoyed accelerated expans
ion both in pupil intake and in the material provision of school structures and equipment, although, with the onset of the economic clout associated with the oil crisis of the 1970s, government efforts alone have been limited.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 With this limitation acknowledged in basic socio-economic principles and/or anticipated from the world economic trends, some states in the subregion did encourage partnership with non\-
governmental institutions, from an early start, for a boosted secondary education provision. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Specifically, Lesotho, Kenya and Botswana are known to have positively and fully exploited the partnership with private trusts, communities and religious missions, all which have responded with active investment in the education sector. }{\v <#/>}{
\v\fs24\lang2057 The size of high-level and medium-level manpower to be seen across the economy that were produced by concerted public and private efforts in these countries is quite considerable.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Such faster effects of combined effort have not been realized as much in Tanzania and Z
ambia, in both of which countries, particularly in the former, ideological battles and contradictions have much in explaining the belated appeal to and the belated and frequently wavering response by such would-be partners in progress.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Not much public and research information was available to allow adequate assessment of the position of Malawi, Swaziland and Uganda on this matter.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 As regards the quality backups to quantitative expansion, some countries, especially Tanzania and Kenya, sought to refor
m the curriculum in such a way as to diversify and vocationalize it enough to produce manpower of a skilled job-entry-level status. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
For reasons detailed in the review, this strategy in curriculum innovation seems to have been an effort based on a wrong
 theoretical premise, leading as it has done to such undesirable effects as an overladen curriculum, unproven cost-effectiveness of biases, and manpower wastage.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Among the rest of the sample countries, Swaziland was saved from the trappings by formally tarrying }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 towards the "curriculum diversification and vocationalization" decision, which she has not taken to date. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
And as for Botswana, Lesotho and Zambia, the reservation with which they have had to reform and adapt their secondary school curricula has spared them from the otherwise full-scale effects experienced by the pioneering two states.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Two major themes emerge from the review of the developments in secondary education, which deserve comment in underlining implications for future policy.
\par }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{\v <#/>}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 1. Public-Private Partnership in Secondary Education Provision </h>
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Evidently, those countries that maintained a consistent and encouraging relationship with non\-governmental institutions - religious bodies, private firms and trusts, co
mmunity organizations - have had a demonstrable advantage in boosting the quantity, spread and quality of secondary education. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
The burden on the shoulders of the state has been considerably lesser in such countries than in those in which, for ideological and other reasons, the relationship has suffered vicissitudes.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Inasfar as there is still and will continue to be a great need not only for a functionally educated manpower but also for the sheer expansion of the knowledge base and perceptive levels 
of a nation's citizenry, partnership and mutual assistance of governmental and non-governmental agencies must be upheld and invigorated. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
For the sake of uniformity of standards and quality control, the government can retain the right of inspection and supervision of private schools as has always been for public schools. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
And for the sake of equity, it could concentrate priority assistance on areas and districts that seem to lag behind in the general trend of the education enterprise.
\par }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{\v <#/>}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 2. Rationalizing the Curriculum </h>
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 In view of the evidence from the review of the experiences with curriculum d
iversification and vocationalization in Tanzania and Kenya within the subregion, and in Colombia in South America, the experiment is no longer worthy of further pursuit. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
A regular secondary school curriculum, enriched by the regular fully fledged disciplines and pruned of extracurricular digressions into non-job-entry reorientations seem to be the most appropriate guide to the full maturity of the youths. }{\v <#/>}{
\v\fs24\lang2057 For, not until then would they be intellectually ready either to take on meaningful occupational training for middle-level job entry or to assume advanced studies with confidence and unattenuated abilities.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The serious job of parallel vocational training - as opposed to half-hearted vocational familiarization - should better be left to specific fulltime vocational training institutions (see Vocational-Technical Training).
\par <h> }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Higher Education </h>
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The review of literature on higher education suggests that the countries under study 
have made considerable progress in the enrolment, training and deployment of local manpower even though, it is to be acknowledged, the rates of student intake and graduate output are based on the small proportions of candidates reaching and passing at the
 secondary school level.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
A proliferation of middle-level tertiary institutions is observed in every country, which suggests the keen interest governments have had in developing manpower of intermediate skills for the various expanded sectors of post-independence economy. }{\v 
<#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
At the same time, however, this has in some countries been at the expense of more insightful planning and coordination that could have avoided duplication of functions in cases of similar training institutions set up or funded by dif
ferent sponsors, internal or external.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 At the highest level, evidence from the literature does testify to efforts having been made in the different countries in the direction of expanding and diversifying university programmes as well as in the univers
ities' positive response to their nations' development needs through teaching, research and public consultancy.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 It is in this seemingly "grey area", however, that the literature also points to one problem universities have suffered in the wake of a con
flict between their search for and speaking about the "truth', on the one hand, and the political demands and administrative directives of the state on the other. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Along with this historical problem of conflict attendant on the crisis of a double-faced 
identity has been the now familiar problem of the decline in the financing of universities and the consequential decline not only in the tempo of research work but also in the extent of intellectual commitment to scholarship among their staff and students
.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 In general, all the eight countries of the study sample seem to have either fared equally well or equally badly in the aspects reviewed. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
There are only a few variations as detailed in the text, but they are not sufficiently major to warrant any special manner of performance ranking of the countries.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The major conclusion common to all the universities in the subregion is that, because of the increasingly precarious financial situation they are in, they are facing a serious prospect of intellectual extinction. }{\v <#/>}{
\v\fs24\lang2057 As such, they are facing a grim future in which they may soon no longer serve as "centres of excellence" or as "think-tanks" for their own nations in charting and expediting the development process.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 While this calls for serious soul-
searching on the part of the governments, particularly with respect to the attitude they have frequently held towards the universities, there is still an important implication for concerted action on the part of both the -governments and  the universities
. It is the search for and experimentation with other practical alternatives.
\par <h> }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Any Options? </h>
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Do universities, in the current unfavourable economic situation besetting the Third World and particularly Africa, have any options to take for a lasting solvency? }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Looking at what they have on their agenda for intellectual, research and general cultural development - in the normal fashion of other universities - and looking at the bare emptiness of their coffers in the midst of the many government
al priorities and interventions, one could not but discern certain options that the universities cannot avoid if they have to survive and remain bona fide university institutions}{\fs24\lang2057 .</X></I> }{\v\fs24\lang2057

\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 Introduction </h>}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The main functions. of University anywhere are to: conduct research; facilitate learning (eg. through teaching); and provide services (eg. consultancy services).
\par <#/>This paper is concerned with facilitation of learning function. <#/>However, it should be understood that each function i
mpinges on the others. <#/>Traditionally, universities the world over, have tended to marginalise the teaching function, and the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM) is no exception. <#/>Instructors are hired on the basis of their potential or actual resear
c
h and publication competencies but not on their teaching competencies. <#/>Promotion and other rewards are also given on the same basis. <#/>It is normally assumed that an instructor hired on this basis can teach. <#/>Thus continued neglect of teaching in
 higher education over the year could gradually result in the deterioration in its quality.
\par <#/>In the United States in the late 1960's and early 1970's, the quality of instruction in a number of higher education institutions had become a source of concern 
for both students and faculty alike but particularly for the former. <#/>A student, for example, who is paying course fees out of his/her own pocket is very concerned if the amount of learning achieved at the end of the course is not worth the money paid.
 
<#/>This concern triggered off a movement on Improving University Teaching (IUT) a movement with which the University of Maryland in the United States has been closely associated. <#/>It turned out that the concern about the quality of instruction in high
er education institutions in the United States was also felt by higher education institutions in both developed and developing countries.
\par <#/>The University of Dar es Salaam joined the IUT band-wagon in the late 1970's when the Senate decided to establish t
he University Teaching and Learning Improvement Programme (UTLIP). <#/>This followed various initiatives dating as far back as 1974, the most notable being the Omari-Kimambo initiative of 1976. <#/>The author of this paper was the first Director or Chief 
C
oordinator of UTLIP; this paper is an attempt to reflect on ten years of UTLIP's experience at the University of Dar es Salaam from that <-/vantagepoint>. <#/>This reflection will focus on the main issues and development trends. <#/>The outcome of this re
flective analysis will form the basis for proposals on UTLIP's future directions towards the year 2000.
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 The Introduction of the IUT Programme </h>}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The Omari-Kimambo initiative was outlined in their paper entitled "Towards Improving University 
Teaching". <#/>In this paper, the authors argued out a case for introducing the IUT programme at University of Dar es Salaam. <#/>Both explicit and implicit in the paper was that the IUT, as a movement sweeping across nations the world over, was essential
l
y an effort towards excellence in <-_high><+_higher> education in the marginated function of teaching. <#/>The Omari-Kimambo initiative was undoubtedly a very controversial issue with half the Faculty opposing it, about a quarter unsure or uncommitted and
 the fourth quarter in support of it. <#/>Debates on the issue went on for two years at all levels - Senate level, Faculty level and Department level with both Faculty and students participating.
\par <#/>Understandably, the students were by and large in favour 
of IUT but the Faculty was divided. <#/>The traditional '<-/die hards>' in the Faculties argued that "teaching is done at school level; at university level we lecture". <#/>However, upon subsequent reflection on the issue, they softened up a little saying
 that if an IUT programme is introduced it should be for junior academics as they are the ones who do not have much university teaching experience.
\par <#/>On the other hand, it was argued that constant search for excellency is the hall-mark of an academic inst
itution anywhere; the proposals under consideration were thus in line with this academic tradition. <#/>Pendaeli (1980:1), commenting on this issue in the same vein states that one thing which is widely accepted in academic and other circles is that: <quo
te_>
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
there is always room for improvement in our knowledge, skills and practices in any given field. This point is better appreciated if it is remembered that fields of enquiry, including teaching, are not static; they are always changing, albeit slowly,...
.and therefore there is a need to constantly up-date ourselves in order to keep abreast with developments and advances in our fields of interest and specialisation.}{\fs24\lang2057  </X><quote/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{\fs24\lang2057 Analysis of the initial reactions and arguments for and against the issue which en
sued and went on for two years suggests that: (1) there are reflections here and there of old and discredited educational concepts in some of the arguments given; (2) the reward mechanism is not much in favour of excellency in teaching; (3) some Faculties
 are making serious assumptions about their ability to teach; and 4) Faculties hold different concepts of teaching; a few confuse teaching with lecturing.
\par <#/>The first observation has to do with reflections of <-/out dated> educational ideas in the arguments given. <#/>Once upon a time, teachers posed and were treated as if they were surveyors of knowledge, skills and attitudes; attention was focused on th
e
 teacher and teaching. <#/>Educators have long moved away from this concept of teacher and teaching following developments in education psychology and related fields. <#/>Attention is now instead focused on learning and the learner whereby, the purpose of
 teaching is to bring about learning. <#/>The teacher plays several roles aimed at facilitating learning.
\par <#/>The second observation is concerned with assumptions made by some academics about their expertise and `specialism'. <#/>For example, the assumption
 that possession of a good postgraduate degree confers upon the possessor the qualities of a good lecturer, is not always true. <#/>There are cases of strong lecturers in terms of research and publications who are poor in lecturing. <#/>A lecturer may be 
v
ery knowledgeable in his/her area of specialization but weak in communicating this knowledge to others, either orally, in writing, or both. <#/>An instructor with such a communication problem should be prepared to learn how to communicate effectively in t
eaching-learning situation with other people including students.
\par <#/>The third observation deals with the variety of concepts of teaching possessed by different Faculty members. <#/>Some see teaching as a kind of "dispensing" activity while others see it as
 a behaviour change or behaviour modification process. <#/>A third group sees teaching as a communication process; that is, communication as being at the heart of all teaching. <#/>The concept of teaching an instructor possesses affects his/her method or 
s
tyle of presentation of subject matter, the manner in which objectives of lectures are written, choice of items (questions) for assessing achievement, and, his/her argument on the place and status of teaching in higher education. <#/>When people engage in
 
a discussion on teaching without realising that the term does not mean exactly the same thing to all the parties, they can end up in unnecessary arguments because of a breakdown in communication. <#/>This problem could account, in part, for the debate on 
the IUT issue which dragged on for two years.
\par <#/>A fourth and last observation on this issue is that the existing reward mechanism marginalises teaching. <#/>Until only recently, research and publication at the University of Dar es Salaam has been virtuall
y the only criterion for the promotion of academic staff; this is a common practice in universities the world over. <#/>Few people who understand the nature of the role played by universities in extending frontiers of knowledge would deny that universitie
s
 should emphasize research and publication. <#/>However, a total marginalisation of teaching is also associated in some way with student <-_unrests><+_unrest> which have become rampant in university campuses. <#/>It is conceivable that during these hard t
imes when resources are limited, students are not having their intellectual needs fully met and are therefore frustrated and reacting. <#/>In the circumstances, it wouldn't be sensible to marginalise teaching to any extent.
\par <#/>The debate on this first issu
e was closed during the 62nd meeting of the University Senate when it was decided that the University Teaching and Learning Improvement Committee (UTLIC) should be established under the chairmanship of a Chief Coordinator/Director. <#/>The Chief Coordinat
o
r is also the Chief Executive. <#/>One of the twelve clauses in the Senate resolution has a <-/far reaching> consequence; it states that "teaching competence should be made a necessary, though not sufficient requirement for appointment, tenure and promoti
on. <#/>For details of the resolution see Appendix I. <#/>See also Appendix II for terms of reference of UTLIC.
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 UTLIP's Status and Position in the University Structure </h>}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The responsibility of improving university teaching has been vested in 
the Senate UTLIC. <#/>The UTLIC has drawn up a programme of activities for discharging its duties and responsibilities. <#/>At Faculty and Department levels, there are Faculty and Department teaching and learning improvement committees and programmes. <#/
>
These teaching and learning improvement committees at different levels are automatically on the agendas of Senate, Faculty Board and Department meetings. <#/>This arrangement is an acknowledgement that UTLIC & UTLIP are not appendages but integral compone
n
ts of the University academic-cum-administrative structure. <#/>UTLIP is not a unit out there which one can conveniently leave out. <#/>The fact that the <-/chair persons> must submit reports of activities of their committees in scheduled meetings of Facu
l
ty Boards and the Senate entails the committees to be active. <#/>The <-/intergration> of UTLIP into the University structure has given it status and accounts in part for its success. <#/>UTLIP's status is further enhanced by making its Director or Chief 
C
oordinator an appointee of the Vice-Chancellor. <#/>Moreover, the appointee ought to be a "solid" educator, and an acknowledged instructor, normally with an academic status of a full professor or an associate professor. <#/>Administratively, UTLIP's Chief
 Coordinator has the same status as a Faculty Dean. <#/>In summary, UTLIP enjoys the support and blessings of the highest authorities in the university as an organic part of its academic-cum-organisational structure.
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 The Scope, Content and Conduct of UTLIP Programmes </h>}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
The UTLIP programme covers the following main areas: (1) Teaching methodology courses; (2) orientation seminars for new expatriate staff; (3) conference of Deans, Directors and Heads of Departments (biannually); (4) roundtable seminars for senior academic
 staff; and (5) computer sensitization courses.
\par <#/>These different elements were introduced and included in the programme at different times following identification of felt needs. <#/>This explains why at the moment, UTLIP is more of an in-service trainin
g programme rather than an academic programme. <#/>The main purpose of any training programme in industry, business, management etc, is to improve job performance of personnel. <#/>A training programme is invariably need-based, for, it must be made releva
nt. <#/>The main concern in UTLIP programmes is also job performance; the teaching-learning job. <#/>UTLIC identifies deficiences or needs of academic staff and uses these as a basis for designing a suitable programme.
\par <#/>UTLIP started off in late 1978 wit
h a rather academic orientation much to the disappointment of participants. <#/>It was assumed that, as a programme of academics, UTLIP should have a purely academic/theoretical orientation. <#/>However, over the years, participants in the teaching method
o
logy courses particularly, have repeatedly criticised these courses for being "too theoretical", "too academic" and "too educational". <#/>Their interest is to learn teaching skills and techniques which will enable them to function better as instructors. 
<
#/>Experience has shown that most participants in UTLIP teaching methodology courses have limited background in education and quite often they are not particularly keen about the theory behind the practice of education. <#/>This explains why teaching meth
o
dology courses have lost much of their original academic and theoretical character and instead have become more and more practical in their orientation in response to practical needs of participants. <#/>Educational theories in the teaching methodology co
urses have thus been kept to the minimum.
\par <#/>Three main observations can be made about the scope, content and conduct of UTLIP programmes to-date.
\par <#/>The areas covered by the UTLIP programme focus on the instructor and instruction. <#/>In other words, UTL
IP's current activities focus on one of three major areas of concern in university teaching; the teacher and teaching. <#/>The other two areas, namely, the learner and learning, and teaching-learning materials have been marginalised. <#/>However, in the e
arly years, UTLIP had a need-based sub-programme on communication skills which was provided under the auspices of the Communication Skills Unit (CSU) within UTLIP. <#/>This sub\-
programme was specifically designed to assist the incoming students as well as o
ther students with communication problems in their respective major fields of study-- Engineering, Medicine, Agriculture, Law, Social Science, Natural Science, etc. CSU subsequently became rather large and separated from the rest of UTLIP. <X_>}{
\v\fs24\lang2057 <#/>UTLIP's foc
us on the teacher and teaching may be associated with the fact that teacher-centred instruction is more commonly practised than learner-centred instruction here in the University of Dar es Salaam and other universities despite the fact that such instructi
on has been discredited.}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 A second observation has to do with the conduct of the teaching methodology course. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Experience to-date shows that there is need to emphasize, over and over again, that in a practical course like this, the resource person is not only teaching an aspect of teaching but is, at the same time, demonstrating how to teach by personal example. }
{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 It is for this very reason that ideally, resource people for teaching methodology courses should be accomplished teachers.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The third observation which is related to the second observation is the need for greater use of a course implementation guideline. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Resource people, accomplished as they may be, differ in their teaching styles and degrees of teaching competence. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 This is not an
 indictment against anybody, rather it is a point worth keeping in mind when drawing up a teaching methodology programme. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
A programme which is team-taught always runs the risk of looking disjointed to the participants unless precautions are taken. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
A given resource person does not know what the colleagues are going to talk about in their parts of the programme or the approaches they are going to use. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
In the circumstances he/she fails to establish vital connection between what has gone on before and what is coming later on in the programme of activities. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 One precaution is to provide a guideline to resource persons. }{\v <#/>
}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The guideline should contain at least two things; a course description and points for resource people to consider during the preparations as well as during the teaching-learning encounter with participants. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
A course description is a statement showing how the topics in the course relate to each other, thus suggesting the teaching sequence. Points for resource people to consider would include the following:

\v\fs24\lang2057 Participants, as far as possible, should be used as resources in various activities of the programme.

\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Assessing and rewarding teaching was and continues to be one of the most controversial issues in IUT at the University of Dar es Salaam. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Two major criticisms have been levelled against this UTLIP programme activity. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
First, it has been argued that it is impossible to assess teaching effectiveness accurately because of the difficulty in determining which of the many possible factors are contributing and the degree to which they are contributing. }{\v <#/>}{
\v\fs24\lang2057 It is this same dif\-ficulty which is inherent in studies on comparative effectiveness of various teaching methods.

\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 One aspect of higher education which has received little attention in Afr
ica since independence is undergraduate and postgraduate teacher education. <#/>University Faculties of education which usually coordinate the process have faced several problems, including conflicts between the academic content requirements in teacher ed
u
cation on the one hand, and the professional components on the other. <#/>Some University authorities, especially in the Faculties have been perpetuating academic rationalist arguments to the effect that if a student knows the subject content of science, 
s
ocial science or language they need not dwell at length on teaching/learning process and classroom techniques. <#/>These views have weakened the resolve of Faculties of education to impart principles of education sufficient to produce professionals in the
 arena of teaching. <#/>Most research and teaching on educational principles and practices leading to better classroom results have therefore been left to western }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>orth}{\fs24\lang2057 
 Universities. <#/>Research findings from such contexts are often inappropriate for th
e transportation prevailing situation in African institutions. <#/>Graduate teacher trainees have also been socialised to ignore education courses which are so crucial in the process of professional development of a teacher. <#/>It is not uncommon to hear
 undergraduate students claim that they are under pressure of time to study and complete assignments, work on Teaching Methods is relatively unimportant compared with the major content areas.
\par <#/>A meeting of the Department of Curriculum and Teaching at the
 University of Dar es Salaam, discussed the above issues and the problems of organisation, allocated time and course content of Teaching Methods courses. <#/>The meeting concluded that the whole issue of undergraduate teacher education needed a review, an
d
 if possible a situational study whose findings would be used to recommend future teaching strategies in undergraduate programmes. <#/>This paper addresses some of these issues and recommends lines of action for the future. <#/>The issues addressed are ce
ntral to any course of professional studies in teaching. <#/>Though the report does not carry any empirical study results, an attempt is made to put together a package of ideas which can be used while the study is being designed to evaluate them.
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 The Problem </h>}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
Past work has addressed the poverty of the Universal Primary Education (UPE) Distant Teacher Preparation Programme (ISHUMI, 1984) and Adult Education Programme. <#/>Teaching methodology (or effective teaching strategy) is, in many respe
cts, the climax of all Teacher Education Programmes. <#/>One cannot boast of running a serious Teacher Education Programme, whether certificate, diploma or degree level if students are not given enough opportunity to learn how to teach effectively in thei
r
 respective subject areas and at the various levels they are expected to go and teach. <#/>To be able to provide such an opportunity, an education department needs to have competent teaching staff, a minimum amount of teaching/learning resources, includin
g
 laboratory facilities, and competent personnel, relevant reading materials, and enough time for students to learn and engage in professional activities. <#/>Such activities include microteaching exercises, lesson design, lesson observation and critique, 
a
nd <-/otherprofessional> practices. <#/>The way the Faculty of Education at the University of Dar es Salaam operates indicates that such a package is far from being achieved, and moreover, trends and well established practices seem to point to complacency
 and lack of serious concern about classroom practice. <#/>Teacher performance in many schools in Tanzania is often described as substandard <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Mbilinyi, 1979, Osaki, 1991)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>
. <#/>Research indicates that the Faculty has not done well enough in the Teacher Education Programme.
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 Forms of Undergraduate Teacher Education Programme </h>}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Since the Second World War, two routes of graduate teacher preparation have evolved in most education systems. <#/>One, B.A. Ed./B.Ed. route, involves students taking cour
ses in major teaching areas simultaneously with education courses. <#/>Education courses are distributed throughout the 3 or 4 year training period and thus academic and professional abilities are developed simultaneously. <#/>The main difference among sc
h
ools of education seems to be on the relative weight and organisation of liberal arts portions of education courses i.e. foundation and administration courses on the one hand, and professional portions i.e. instructional strategies, or methods and field e
xperience on the other. <#/>Many North American schools of education have recently tended to focus more on pedagogical aspects concentrated on behavioural psychology in their liberal arts portion. <#/>British }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>orth}{\fs24\lang2057 
 Institutions tend to give a more eclect
ic liberal arts programme, that concentrates on both psychology and other principles of education, but attempt to link these aspects with teaching strategies and school experience. <#/>Most schools of education in Africa are still struggling with the syst
e
m left by the former colonial governments. <#/>In East Africa, for example, the three year B.A/B.Sc. with education programmes established by the UNESCO Project after independence have persisted <-/todate>. <#/>It is only recently that reflections on thei
r improvement have begun. <#/>On top of the agenda was the increase in time allocation to the programme, though it is not clear how the extra year will be utilized, what priorities exist, and the options to be adopted.
\par <#/>The second style, which is sometim
es called the PGCE route, is less common in Africa at the moment. <#/>It is more common in western systems particularly certain British and even North American Universities. <#/>Students enrol in the education programme after completing their academic deg
r
ee programmes, hence the title <-/post graduate> certificate of education (PGCE). <#/>From the organisational point of view, this route gives more room for holistic approaches to graduate teacher preparation by enabling one whole year to be devoted to edu
c
ation courses. <#/>Again, liberal arts and professional portions (i.e. teaching strategies) are covered and ample time is often available for field experience and provision of feedback to students during field practice . <#/>Organisation of programmes, ho
w
ever, depends on the working environment of each school. <#/>Many people think that the PGCE route provides more time for Faculty members in education to organise their programme, while others think the B.Ed. route is better at promoting intellectual and 
p
rofessional growth simultaneously. <#/>The important thing is that any programme works best if those running the same are comfortable with it and school systems feel they are getting good quality teachers out of it, capable of working within the existing 
s
chool structure. <#/>Whatever goes on in Faculties and schools of education influences teacher preparation programmes at all other teachers' colleges in the country. <#/>Thus, if the Faculty of Education adopts a `crush programme' approach, for example, a
ll other teachers' colleges will tend to emulate the model.
\par <#/>There is a growing feeling even in Developed Countries that the course content that prospective and practising teachers have an opportunity to learn is highly unstable and individualistic acros
s teachers' colleges. <#/>However, most good programmes address three common strands: general education; }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct}{\fs24\lang2057  subject matter content, and pedagogy (teaching methods) }{\v\fs24\lang2057 Lanier & Little, 1986)}{
\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>In the pedagogy programme, tension between liberal arts portions i.e. foundations, and psychology and professional portions e.g. methods, is real in many }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>orth}{\fs24\lang2057 
 Institutions whether American, British or African. <#/>Since the 1970s, researchers have been wondering about the place of each of these components in
 the `total mix' of Teacher Education Programmes. <#/>Horowitz (1974) argues that for any Teacher Education Programme to be effective it ought to include among other things a field experience component. <#/>With this component, effective student-teachers 
will learn to integrate the various components of the training in a school environment while working within a pool of experienced professionals <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Horowitz, p. 90-91)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>
. <#/>Recent attempts to introduce the <AmE/>behaviorist philosophy in teaching methodology courses in North America <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Hunter, 1982; Joyce and Weil, 1986)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X> 
have moved many schools of education but also raised several questions.
\par <#/>Among the crucial questions raised is the impact of the <AmE/>behaviorist focus of teacher training on professional dev
elopment. <#/>It has been argued that most of what happens in the process of preparing a teacher, doctor, lawyer and so forth can't be called `training' in the mere sense of behaviour modification. <#/>It is also largely a change in one's view of the worl
d and one's attitudes about people. <#/>Thus, the mere knowledge of the skills/`tricks' of managing a class doesn't make one an effective teacher.
\par <#/>The need for more time on a training programme is a real one. <#/>In a recent review of empirical studies 
in this area, Fuller & Heyneman <-_tabulates><+_tabulate> the following as factors and percentages of studies showing positive effects on learning in Third World school systems.
\par <#/>The University of Dar es Salaam's complaints about lack of time and use of part-time lecturers in methods courses were raised in a recent paper <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Meena et al 1987)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>
. <#/>It was recommended that more time was necessary for methods courses to be able to achieve the ideal objectives for the process of producing a competent teacher. <
#/>Further evidence of the poverty of methods courses is available from Teaching Practice (Field Experience) Reports submitted each year by student-teachers after their 2nd Year TP. <#/>Unfortunately, none of these reports has been published. <#/>The trut
h remains, therefore, that we are <-/data rich> but <-/research poor> in relative terms. <#/>Many such reports reveal problems of student-teachers working alongside older teachers whose social construction of teaching, so called <ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 
hali <ea/>halisi}{\fs24\lang2057 , empha
sises lecturing and expository teaching strategies. <#/>Others lament that student teachers are often not well prepared to teach by active methods of learner involvement due to the limited time allocated to methods courses, or sometimes the lack of seriou
s
ness accorded to these courses in relation to content mastery. <#/>Thus, these reports raise many questions on the undergraduate Teacher Education Programme being offered. <#/>Of immediate importance however, is the need to examine the planning and teachi
ng of instructional strategy courses and possibly increase the time allocated to such professional studies courses.
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 Teaching Practice Reports </h>}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The annual Reports of the Teaching Practice Organiser also indicate that student-teachers face se
veral problems in classroom presentation, ranging from inability to arouse student interest, failure to explain things properly, lack of effective questioning strategies, and inability to organise student activities be they group discussions, debates, or 
l
aboratory investigations. <#/>These are observed even among second year students who have done Teaching Methods Courses. <#/>Traditional teaching methods are common, for example student-teachers simply talking to the students or to the blackboard and writ
i
ng notes on the board often with mistakes. <#/>While these reports have addressed most of the problems student-teachers are facing, no work has seriously discussed possible solutions to the Methods Courses. <#/>Time has come when such a discussion is abso
lutely necessary.
\par <#/>Table 2: indicates the present courses and the Departments of Tutors. <#/>The status of methods courses at present indicates that most of these courses are being taught by tutors outside the Department of Curriculum and Teaching, and t
hat most of the methods tutors have little or no background in curriculum theory. <#/>Although many may have some teaching experience, most of them were in classrooms more than 10 years ago and may not have studied classroom dynamics or effective teaching
 
strategies. <#/>Some courses, run by tutors with both a recent school experience, a good background in curriculum issues and interest in classroom dynamics, will have more depth and possibly tougher assignments than the others. <#/>Some students then comp
lain that some methods lecturers are overworking them.
\par <#/>Textbooks for each course are varied and many tutors appear to be operating without any standard reading texts. <#/>While time allocation for all courses is 1 hour, actual engaged time is often redu
ced due to movements and other delays. <#/>Some tutors, after discussing with their students, add another hour to make it 2. <#/>This practice makes some courses cover more content and pedagogy than others. <#/>It also gives more opportunity for the micro
teaching exercise in these groups.

\par }\pard \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Some tutors do not differentiate between secondary education on the one hand and teacher education or adult education students on the other. <#
/>Some even combine the two. <#/>This is inappropriate because: first, the student-teachers are being prepared to work with different categories of learners whose needs are psychologically very different. <#/>You cannot, for example, use the strategies of
 teaching secondary adolescents in a primary school, or an elders functional literacy class and hope to achieve good results. <#/>Thus you cannot combine the secondary and teacher education group, or, worse still, with the adult education group. <X_>}{
\v\fs24\lang2057 <#/>That is why each group has a separate course. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Secondly, teacher education methods in particular have the objective of enabling the student tutor (teacher educator) to develop the skills necessary to train other teachers. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Since most of these student tutor
s might be training grade C, A and diploma teachers simultaneously, a complex problem exists because one needs to assist them develop the ability to: (1) up-grade the level of content knowledge of the teacher trainees they will be working with (e.g. from 
s
tandard seven to say, form two level, or form 4 level to about form 5 or 6 level etc); (2) understand the curriculum of the levels their student-teachers are going to teach (e.g. primary school, or secondary school curriculum) hence, they must examine the
 
relevant syllabuses; and (3) teach various teaching strategies and classroom techniques, including lesson planning and preparation, classroom questioning and management, group formation, micro-teaching etc; which are also covered in secondary methods cour
ses. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 This group will need much more rigour than the secondary methods one. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 It is, therefore, not recommended to combine the groups.

\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
When one mentions the term "education" or "training", probably the first mental image we form is that of a classroom or a seminar room or a lecture <AmE/>theater. <#/>Inside these buildings are pupils, students or participants and an "a
uthority" in a particular subject-matter standing in front of these learners behind a podium. <#/>This authority usually called many names e.g teacher, tutor, lecturer, professor e.t.c, believes and the learners believe him as a "know-all". <#/>Even if th
e students are adults of a comparable age and ability with the teacher, he/she would generally be seen to have some skills, knowledge or experience the others do not have.
\par <#/>Contemporary educational and training techniques require students to be masters o
f their own learning. <#/>In other words they are supposed to take responsibility of their own learning through discussion, role-play, simulation e.t.c. <#/>It is this learner-<AmE/>centered approach which has supposedly transformed the role of a lecturer
 (in a classical sense) to one of a facilitator. <#/>The lecturer's primary role is one of creating learning environments which are stimulating, relevant, and effective to a learning process.
\par <#/>If an }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>orth}{\fs24\lang2057  Institution is to produce knowledge that is re
levant to the needs, experience, and aspirations of its clients, it has to direct its curriculum to the practical real-life problem solving situation of the environment. <#/>In such a situation it has to continually evaluate its programmes, its objectives
, its tools, and methods.
\par <#/>It is the methods which this paper addresses itself to. <#/>The paper argues that although IDM has tried to recruit academic staff whose qualifications are beyond questions, it has yet to make training of trainers course (TOT) 
at the Institute a serious activity.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 2.}{\b\fs24\lang2057  TOT's AT IDM </h>}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Training of trainers courses (TOTs) have strictly speaking meant to expose newly recruited members of academic staff, particularly the tutorial assistants, and those members who are not
 tutorial assistants, but who had no opportunity in the past to attend TOTs with a view to streamline them into realities of modern training.
\par <#/>In such courses, participants are introduced to general learning theories, different training techniques such 
as lecturing, discussions, simulation, brainstorming, case study, role play e.t.c. <#/>Such courses normally take a week. <#/>This period is too short. <#/>It would be unrealistic to expect the skills acquired in the one week TOT, to be applied by the tra
inees when their turn comes to train students or participants. <#/>Since the time is too short to comprehensively cover all training techniques, the methods used in these courses are mainly "telling" than "doing".
\par <#/>Many trainers and psychologists do agre
e that learning by doing is a very important factor in the training-learning situation. <#/>Subscribing to this view, Ishumi quotes renowned psychologists and philosophers. <#/>He says, Dewey a renowned psychologist among others, emphasized the aspect of 
"
doing" in the education of children. <#/>Ishumi continues, Dewey was not the first to spell out this view. <#/>There were others before him. <#/>People like Marcus Fabius Quintilian in the first century, John Amos Comenius in the seventeenth century, and 
Jean Jacques Rousseau in the }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>orth}{\fs24\lang2057  Eighteenth century. <#/>All of them have "in one way or another, directly or indirectly shared this view in the process of education"
\par The old }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>orth}{\fs24\lang2057  chinese proverb sums up the notion of learning by doing. <#/>It goes
 thus: "I see, I forget, I hear, I forget, I do, I remember". <#/>It therefore follows that if a trainee is simply told about such and such training techniques he/she may not remember them. <#/>But if he/she is given an opportunity to try them out in the 
same TOT, experientially, it is highly likely, in our opinion, that he/she will actually remember and use them when training his/her students or participants in any course.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 3. }{\b\fs24\lang2057 EFFECTS OF A SHORT TOT OR NO TOT AT ALL </h>}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Since lecturers are not
 normally trained to train, TOT is meant to fill this gap albeit extemporaneously. <#/>In the absence of this course or a not carefully planned course, the Institute may be failing in its number one mission i.e training. <#/>Take a case of someone joining
 
the academic staff who has never been in class to "teach". <#/>Take another case of someone who has just completed his degree or diploma and employed as a Tutorial Assistant. <#/>Both persons are, as a matter of practice at IDM, thrown into classes to tra
in andragogically rather than pedagogically in both long and short courses. <#/>The assumption which both will carry into a class is that of an omniscient lecturer in a particular subject matter to be transmitted to the students.
\par <#/>As a result of such bel
ief, they are therefore infallible in their areas of specialization. <#/>To blame them for this orientation is unfair to them, for we did not train them in andragogical methods. <#/>Knowles defines the term pedagogy as "the art and science of teaching chi
ldren". <#/>He further contends that the <-_learners><+_learner\rquote 
s> experience does not count much in the teaching-learning process. <#/>The experience which matters is that of the teacher, textbook writer and other experts. <#/>Therefore children expect answers to all their questions from the teacher
\par Again, on (p.43) he defines andragogy as, "the art and science of helping adults learn". <#/>He probes further that when people grow and develop they gather and store a considerable experience which becomes a pe
rpetual rich resource for learning. <#/>He further argues that people tend to value the learning they acquire from experience than }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 they receive passively. <#/>Accordingly, he says, the basic techniques in the training of adults are experiential techniques i.e discussion, case study, problem-solving, simulation exercises, role play, just to mention a few.
\par <#/>All the mentioned training methods (the list is by no means exhaustive) are all talked about in these TOTs. <#/>Our contention is that the 
mere explanation of these methods, without the actual involvement of the trainees in these techniques, has not guaranteed their application in the performance of the trainees when training students in a long course or participants in a short course.

 is not enough, if we may venture an opinion, for example to tell the trainees that case study method requires the participants to read a particular case and discuss the problems involved and the possible ramifications of a variety of decisions from which
 
they are supposedly able to generalize for future use. <#/>We maintain that without the trainees engaging themselves in the analysis of cases, in their own training or without performing role plays by themselves and thereby learning how these techniques a
nd others are prepared and actually use them, the likelihood to revert to old pedagogic methods is very high.
\par <#/>However, opposing voices might argue that TOTs at the IDM are conducted in this way largely because of lack of modern training <-_equipments><+
_equipment> such as video recorders and television sets. <#/>We would like to believe that these modern training <-_equipments><+_equipment> are vital if available. <#/>These machines which visualize the trainees themselves in action allow them to see the
ir strengths and weaknesses while conducting micro-training.
\par <#/>Other voices might respond that certainly there are other alternative ways which could be devised and work well in place of video recorders and televisions. <#/>An example could be to introduc
e micro-training sessions. <#/>In these sessions a trainee could train his/her colleagues, at the same time his/her colleagues together with the trainer jotting down strengths and weaknesses of their colleagues training style. <#/>At the end of the sessio
n
, the group discusses its observation and probably reach a consensus. <#/>We venture to say that this is not the practice at the IDM's TOTs. <#/>Not at least in those TOTs we have had an opportunity to attend. <#/>Nevertheless, we tend to agree that under
 the current }{\fs24\ul\lang2057 one week}{\fs24\lang2057  TOT, it is probably justifiable for the too little too hurriedly given in these TOTs.
\par <#/>At the IDM just like in any other institution of higher learning ,its curricula is geared towards making students pass their examinations. <#/>We
 tend to agree (albeit with some reservations) that the heavy workload for both students and lecturers, militates against applying andragogical methods in long courses.
\par <#/>Most and probably all achievement examinations which possess a pass-mark, function 
as qualifying examinations for progression or promotion to a further stage of education or training. <#/>This being so, it seems entirely reasonable to set a "standard of mastery" of the previous phase of training which is necessary before the student can
 move on to the next phase. <#/>Only those students who had mastered such "minimum essentials" would then be promoted to the next grade or be awarded a certificate, diploma or a degree. <#/>Under the circumstances pedagogical methods rather than }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>orth}{\fs24\lang2057  Andragogical ones seem to be acceptable, }{\fs24\ul\lang2057 but}{\fs24\lang2057  we strongly feel that the two can be combined, more so in seminars.
\par <#/>It is in the "teaching" of short courses which do not terminate with examinations, where pure andragogical methods ought to dominate. <#/>No 
doubt the professors and senior lecturers do train in these courses experientially. <#/>This is mainly because of their rich experience and of course the TOTs they had attended elsewhere. <#/>Our worry is on the junior trainers. <#/>These trainers who mos
t
 likely attended or did not even attend the hasty one week TOT are sometimes called upon to train participants in short courses without the knowledge of experiential techniques. <#/>It runs contrary to the intuitions of many trainers and teachers who oper
ate on the basis that "skill getting" precedes "skill using".
\par <#/>It is therefore difficult to reach any other conclusion other than that, these junior trainers are certainly being thrown in at the deep end. <#/>We should remember that these are the profess
ors and senior lecturers of tomorrow and thus there is a need to prepare them adequately.
\par <#/>We therefore hold that, it is through the actual "seeing and doing" where these new junior trainers can be able to learn the need to encourage and facilitate part
icipation of students, without the need of dominating or demonstrating their intellectual superiority in a training situation. <#/>It is this superiority which make trainers wrongly believe that students or participants cannot teach them. <#/>Ndunguru rem

\par It is our considered

\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 We will try to suggest how the TOT at IDM should be improved. <#/>Firstly we have pointed out that the time for which these courses are conducted is very short. <#/>It
 should be extended to run for at least three weeks. <#/>During these three intensive and comprehensive weeks, TOT should really be a microcosm of any short courses conducted at IDM. <#/>The trainees should not only read or hear about role play, rather th
e
y should practice role playing in their TOTs. <#/>They should not only read or hear about case study, instead they should in real terms analyze cases in their TOTs. <#/>They should not only read or hear about in-basket simulation, brainstorming e.t.c., bu
t they should also <-_practice><+_practise> all of these training methods. <#/>This is what we have argued in favour of, that it is a sound educational and psychological principle that learning is best demonstrated through performance.
\par <#/>Secondly, IDM sho
uld try to have a specific time for employing Tutorial Assistants and others above Tutorial Assistants. <#/>If employed as a group it will be easy to conduct TOT for them before they are thrown into training sessions. <#/>We are recommending this, for onl
y
 one reason already pointed out in this paper which is the fact that lecturers are not normally trained to train, these three weeks of TOT before they start "teaching" will give them a new orientation in what is expected of them. <#/>This is the practice 
elsewhere, for example, at the University of Dar es }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>orth}{\fs24\lang2057  salaam.
\par <#/>Thirdly, to ensure maximum concentration and seriousness in the TOT courses, they should be run outside IDM. <X_>}{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Since almost all participants in these courses stay on the campus, ther
e is a tendency of frequent absenteeism from session to session. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 It is not uncommon to find about two thirds of the participants out for various reasons. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
These reasons range from going to offices to attend a pending issue, or going to the Bank in town.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Lastly it would probably be a good idea for the Institute to identify lecturers whose duty inter alia, will be to train the newly recruited trainers. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Again, this is the practice at the University of Dar es }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>orth}{\v\fs24\lang2057  salaam.
\par <h> 5. }{\v <#/>}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 CONCLUSION </h>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The TOT at IDM should now be planned, conducted and be seen as a watershed. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
At the end of their course, trainees should clearly see that the course has stamped out their beliefs they had of being omniscient lecturers or trainers in the training and learning situation. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
At the end of the course they should genuinely regard their trainees-to-be, (be they, }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 students in a long course or participants in a short course) as persons of worth whose feelings and ideas ought to be respected. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
They (TOT graduates) should regard themselves as contributors, facilitators and co-learners when training others. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
They should always remember that a trainer often discovers that he/she has gained more from a training programme than his students. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
By the process of helping others accumulate new knowledge, skills and attitudes, the trainers cement their own beliefs and actions.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Trainers of these TOTs on the other hand should strive to be models worth imitating. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 It is said that more often 
than not students tend to emulate a successful trainer whom they have come to respect during their training. It often happens that the training style of the trainer in a Training of Trainers course determines the style of the student as he in turn leads t
raining sessions. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Who would not like to be emulated by his students? }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 We assume the answer is none}{\fs24\lang2057 .</X></I>

Yet, if we really want to make positive educational changes, we need to begin with understanding them as they actually are. }{\v <#/>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 This paper contends 
that view of teaching as learning facilitation and of learning as a self-initiated process of the learner are at best idealistic. }{\v <#/>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 
What obtains in the reality of the school is adaptive and strategic learning which should be better labelled as "studenting", involving a repertoire of learning styles which the student uses to adjust to different teachers. }{\v <#/>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 
It is shown that teaching both as a family of activity-types as put fo

It is highlighted that the transformation of teaching into the ideal must begin by recognizing, in addition, that the teaching styles with which students seek to align their learning style are determined to a large extent 
by the way teachers themselves learn.

\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 This quotation illustrates the fact that there is a great difference between teachers and students in the w
ay they perceive teaching and learning in a schooling context. <#/>Studies on teaching and learning and their interrelationships have tended to adopt the teacher's viewpoint and have overlooked what they are like from the student's point of view. <#/>This
 
paper seeks to summarise analytic work of the last one decade on the concept of teaching and its relationship to learning and argues that an adequate understanding of their interrelationship can best be achieved by taking seriously the student viewpoint o
n both learning and teaching.
\par <#/>The paper has three parts. <#/>The first one presents the analysis of teaching on the basis of the work of Green (1971), Soltis and Kerr (1974) as well as Stride (1973). <#/>The second one analyses the concept of learning f
rom both the teacher and student perspectives. <#/>The third part discusses the relation between the two and draws implications for the improvement of educational practice on the basis of the conception of learning in the context of "studenting" seen as a
 parallel to teaching.
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 The Concept of Teaching </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 In the last decade and a half, a lot of analytic work has been done to throw light on the concept of teaching and the way it relates to learning. <#/>The analysts include [names] <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Scheffer (197
3), Green (1965 & 1971), Dietl (1973), McClellan (1976), Soltis & Kerr (1974), Freire (1972) and Fenstermacher with Soltis (1986), }{\fs24\lang2057 </X> to mention but a few.
\par <#/>Only a few of the studies have looked at teaching as a relationship; a profession that society hold
s in high esteem. <#/>The society entrusts the teacher with a socializing function in relation to the younger generation, thus defining the relative power he/she has. <#/>Others have looked at teaching as an activity but invariably without showing that it
 
is merely the actualization of the professional relationship. <#/>This should explain why a change of teaching modes or approaches cannot necessarily alter that relationship whereby it is the teacher's expectations and not their own which students or pupi
ls must seek to fulfil or meet. <#/>It is noteworthy that those who have attempted to elucidate on the concept of teaching have focused more on the activity aspect than on the relation aspect.
\par <#/>Two types of analyses of teaching as an activity have emerged. <#/>The first type has looked at teaching as an activity continuum or range. <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Green 1965 & 1971).}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{
\fs24\lang2057 According to Green, teaching should be understood "not as a single activity, but as a whole family of activities within which some members appear to be of more significance than others" <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (1965:286)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>
. <#/>In other words, teaching comprises many activities but only some of them should be considered "teaching proper" while the rest are labelled "teaching improper". <#/>The former are at the very <AmE/>center 
of the continuum while the latter are peripheral. <#/>On one part of the continuum, the activities aim at achieving the learning of behaviour content (knowledge-how), while on the other the activities aim at learning that is propositional in nature (knowl
e
dge-that). <#/>In the first case the activities range from training through conditioning to "coercion", while in the second case they range from instruction through preaching and indoctrination to sheer brainwashing. <#/>At the <AmE/>center of the continu
um, the activities that make up teaching proper are instruction and training precisely because they appeal to the intelligence or conviction or reasoning power of the learner.<X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (See Fig 1)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 .}{
\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The activities that constitute teaching improper are part of the 
concept of teaching all the same; they have their place in teaching provided one has a developmental conception of education. <#/>For example, to very young children, parents simply prescribe behaviours or manners without bothering to explain the rational
e behind them. <#/>But as the child grows, the parents begin to provide rationales for their prescriptions. <#/>Similarly, conditioning has proven very useful in the training of severely handicapped children.
\par <#/>This view of teaching as a continuum of qualitatively different activities within a genus or family, is rendered much more complete by the analysis of a single teaching activity that may occur at any one point on the continuum. <#/>This has been attem
p
ted by, among others, Soltis and Kerr(1974). <#/>In their study, they saw the teaching activity as involving purposeful 'Acts' of setting general goals (G) and sub-goals (g), the attainment of which is a function of choosing strategies (t) and tactics (i)
 appropriate to the learning situation (S). <#/>Thus teaching activity is summarised in a formula of Acts related to goal-setting and the choosing of strategies and tactics as shown below: }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>formula}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 T: A(G), (S)/A(g), A(t), A(i).}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Again as an improvement on the analysis of the single teaching activity, there have been analysts who have looked at the acts of teaching as falling in a three-phased process of planning, implementation (encounter) and evaluation 
<X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Stride 1973 and Jackson 1966)}{\fs24\lang2057 </x>. <#/>In a diagram, the process phases would look like:
\par As can be noted from Fig. II, evaluation is involved in the first two phases as a separate and terminal phase of teaching. <#/>Borrowing from Jackson (1966), Stride (1973) has alternatively labelled the phases as pre-
active, interactive, and post-active. <#/>In the same spirit, teaching is sometimes defined as "the process of making and implementing decisions before, during and after instruction, to increase the probability of learning".<X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
(Cornett 1983:39)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 .}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The analy
sis of teaching, as purposive acts particularly in the encounter or interactive phase, has uncovered the concept of teaching as a social relationship referred to above. <#/>Scholars such as Paulo Freire (1972) have been quite critical of the standard rela
t
ionships that govern conventional formal teaching-learning situations. <#/>They have advocated for more democratic or egalitarian relationships by adopting more "dialogical" methods of teaching. <#/>However, one should not be misled by these critiques int
o overestimating the power of the new teaching acts to change the socially sanctioned relationships in educational settings. <#/>Clearly, it is the power structure in society and the locus of power over formal education that finally counts.
\par <#/>Green has el
ucidated the concept of teaching as a family of activities that can be placed on a continuum according to whether they aim at <AmE/>behavioral (know-how) or propositional (know-that) learning on the one hand, and according to the degree to which they appe
a
l to the learner's intelligence or not, on the other. <#/>Soltis and Kerr have elucidated the concept of teaching activity as a set of related purposeful acts involving the setting of goals and sub-goals as well as the choice of strategies and tactics app
r
opriate to the learning situation. <#/>Stride and others place the various teaching acts within a process made up of the planning phase, the encounter (interactive) phase and the evaluation phase. <#/>The encounter or interactive phase has received a lot 
o
f analytic attention, revealing in the process the power of teaching as a relationship socially prescribed. <#/>But in all this, teaching is idealized as a service to the learner, thus giving the impression that it is the learner who calls the tune of the
 educational music. <#/>Trow (1963-31) has summed up this view saying, "the teacher is not one who imparts knowledge and skill to another, but one who helps another gain his own knowledge and skill".
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 The Concept of Learning  </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 In a sense, le
arning is a reactive/adaptive change that an organism undergoes - a change in the way it relates to or makes sense of its environment. <#/>This may be a result of purely casual experience that may be conscious or unconscious. <#/>It sounds a rather passiv
e view of learning that is anachronistic. <#/>But psychologists have dealt with broad 'osmosis-type', non-deliberate and reactive learning as instrumental learning.
\par <#/>While such non-deliberate learning certainly does happen in a schooling context, it has not featured prominently in educational discourse except in the context of "the hidden curriculum" <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Giroux 1985)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>
. <#/>Otherwise educators have tended to focus on and highlight what may be called 'intentional learning'; the learning that happens as a result
 of deliberate concerted effort by the organism itself as a 'change-initiator'. <#/>This has sometimes been referred to as operant learning. <#/>This form of learning sounds much more palatable and fashionably modern today when teaching has come to be con
ceived as a facilitation service to the active learner.
\par <#/>Admittedly, the term 'to learn' is variously used. <#/>There are times when it is used to mean to be taught something as in the sentence 'What do you learn at school? <#/>'. <#/>It is also used to 
mean to study, practice, exercise, memorize, enquire, search into something as in 'I am learning English on my own' . <#/>The third sense of the term is to gain knowledge, information, skill, mastery, comprehension or understanding of something . <#/>This
 is the achievement sense of the term. <#/>Thus one can use it with the auxiliary 'have' as in 'I have learned driving' . <#/>One cannot say 'I am learning English' in this sense if not in the other two senses presented above.
\par <#/>From this analysis, one se
nse of 'to learn' refers to achievement and not to a process. <#/>The other two senses refer to a process conceptualized in two ways, namely, learning as a process of adaptation, accommodation or reactive change; and learning as a process of change-initia
t
ion from within. <#/>The question at this point is: How does learning in these senses relate to teaching as a relationship; as a family of activity-types spread out on a continuum expressing a social relationship, and as a set of purposeful acts adding up
 to a process aiming at the facilitation of learning of another as presented above.
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 Relationship between Teaching and Learning </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 When one examines the relationship between teaching and learning as processes, both aim at the achievement sense
 of learning although in different ways. <#/>In its intentional sense as a change-initiation process motivated from within the organism, learning aims at the organism's own or self-defined learning attainment. <#/>But in the adaptive or reactive sense, th
e learning process aims at other-defined as opposed to self-defined learning attainment.
\par <#/>On the other hand, if one takes teaching in global terms, it too aims at learning attainment. <#/>But, unlike in the case of the learning process, teaching aims at 
the learning of the student and not of the teacher himself or herself, or at least not exclusively. <#/>When we talk of the relationship of teaching to learning, we must bear in mind the two senses of learning just presented. <#/>Where learning is a proce
s
s of self-initiation, the teacher does not necessarily come in. <#/>If and when he/she does come in, it is merely as a resource person at the call of the learner; he or she does not come in to define for the learner the learning attainment, and the learne
r
 is at liberty to accept or reject the teacher's assistance. <#/>From the learner's viewpoint, the teaching is indeed a 'learning facilitation service' and no more, and learning is 'free learning'. <#/>However, in institutional formal education settings, 
t
he teacher is expected by the society not merely to facilitate learning, as it is fashionable to describe his role today, but to set learning expectations for the learners, while the learners are not expected to set their own agenda but to accommodate the
mselves to the expected learning attainments.
\par <#/>It is arguable that the view of teaching as a free facilitation service to the free active learning process of the learner is at best idealistic. <#/>In fact, it is an abstraction in the conventional formal 
educational settings. <#/>In the world of actuality, it is the teacher who calls the learning tune to which the learners must dance if they are to survive as students or pupils. <#/>While indeed teachers may try to adapt themselves to the learners, it is 
t
he latter who must adjust to the teacher. <#/>After all, the teacher deals with a variety of learners and it is not easy for him or her to adjust to each and every learner and so follow Cornett's advice: "the more the teacher knows about the child's learn
i
ng style, the more likely it is that the mediation will be effective", (1983:10). <#/>The reverse is closer to the truth, and students and pupils know this realism very well. <#/>This is in line with the power that society has conferred on teachers for se
tting learning agenda for learners. <X_>}{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
What learners engage in is therefore not essentially free and active learning but rather adaptive and strategic learning for their survival as students or pupils, given the existing power relations}{\fs24\lang2057 . }{\v\fs24\lang2057 <#/>It is therefor
e important to bear in mind the distinction between the ideal where learning is free and active and occurs on the learner's own terms and the real school world where learning is strategic, adaptive or reactive to teaching.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 It would seem that to teachin
g as a relation socially defined, it is adaptive-strategic learning which really corresponds while the active-intentional learning would correspond to teaching occurring outside or disregarding the socially defined relationship.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 If we look at teaching as a family of activity-types spread out on a continuum of Green, or even as a set of purposeful acts adding up to a three-stage process, there is no corresponding analysis of the concept of learning. }{
\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 This is understandable because in the world of schooling, learning has invariably been strategic and adaptive to teaching. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
It is therefore almost impossible to analyse free-intention learning within formal educational institutions. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Here, we are used to learning circumscribed by teaching as primaril
y a relationship which then is actualized in activity-types and purposeful acts. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Studies which have been done on students' learning style reveal that for them, the learning process is indeed "the process of having students gradually become more adept at adjusting learning style to teaching style and the task..." (Cornett 1983:39). }{
\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 A similar conclusion was reached in a large-scale longitudinal research by Entwistle and Ramsden (1983) on understanding student learning.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 To avoid confusion we should rename students' school learning which is thus adaptive and strategic as "studenting" (or "pupiling"). }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
This is appropriate because, unlike learning, it implies also a socially defined relationship to teaching. In addition, analogous to teaching, it can be seen as a family of learning styles which a student engages in to actualize a known relation. }{\v 
<#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Such styles (or behavioural patterns) can be put on a continuum at the <AmE/>center of which will be those most strategic, and at the extremes, those least strategic for his/her survival as a student. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
The question to ask at this point is: what will be most strategic?
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Well, consistent with the framework developed above, this will depend on the teacher who calls the tune. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 In other words, the teac
hing style will influence the 'studenting' activity or learning style. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Accordingly, Cornett (1983:14) maintains that we tend to teach not according to the way students learn, much as we would like it that way, rather "we tend to teach the way we learn, unless there is a conscious reason to do otherwise". }{\v <#/>}{
\v\fs24\lang2057 Thus, if as teachers we learn uncritically, for example, we will tend to preach or indoctrinate our students and expect them to be dogmatic believers and to be docile to us. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Students will accord

\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The p
urpose of this paper is to highlight the major issues involved in financing education in Tanzania and relate the issues to selected school finance principles. <#/>Alternative ways of addressing the issues are given ensuring that they are fair and equitabl
e
 across the individuals, school units, district (town) councils or education sectors. <#/>It is proposed that any financing strategy should provide the school units with the maximum possible revenue to meet the needs of the students. <#/>Through a needs a
ssessment of the current situation, the paper attempts to pave the way for the financial role of the communities, individuals, local government, central Government and donor agencies' support.
\par <#/>The proposed methods of financing education ought to stimula
te private initiative, through some degree of decentralization in which education financing and administration are not co-terminus, but otherwise, give the central Government and external donors the opportunity to assist the community in discharging its e
d
ucational financial responsibilities. <#/>However, not all school units, individuals, schooling levels, regions (or districts) are the same. <#/>School units and districts, for example, have differing costs, and differing needs for their students. <#/>Ind
ividuals have differing financial capacity or needs. <#/>They also get differing private benefits from education. <#/>The social benefits accruing from different levels of education are also different.
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 The Issues </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 Every child in Tanzania, regardless of where he or she lives, should have access to a complete basic primary education that meets his or her needs and society's needs. <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Recent studies <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
(Mosha, 1988; Omari and Mosha, 1987; Ndabi, 1985)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X> indicate that the q
uality of primary education is very low, especially in the rural areas. <#/>There is also a difference in education quality across the regions and districts. <#/>Teachers in town schools are highly qualified compared to those in rural schools. <#/>Yet sel
ected student background (e.g. social economic status), and school characteristics (such as good teachers and quality of surroundings) influence standard seven achievement.
\par <#/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 The costs of providing complete basic primary education and the local fiscal capacity to mobilize the financial resources vary widely across the local authorities and town councils. <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
The provision of primary and adult education is the responsibility of the Ministry of Local Government and Cooperative Development (MLGCD). <#/>The ce
ntral Government subsizes the local governments through a <-/lumpsum> subvention amounting to the estimated shortfall of local revenue in relation to the targeted level of education services. <#/>The local governments usually allocate funds to various sec
tors by pooling the local revenue with the central Government <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Anderson and Rosengart, 1987)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>
. <#/>However, the type of "poll tax" levied by local governments raises significant inequities across the different groups of residences. <#/>Transfers from central
 Government are not based on equalization formulae. <#/>Flat grants do not encourage local creativity or reward local initiative as the system of governance remains centralised in decision making and few important decisions on education are made locally.

\par <#/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 
If the local governments, town councils and village governments are to attain local autonomy and control, they will have to depend more on local revenues and, therefore, should be given more local taxing power than presently available. <#/>}{
\fs24\lang2057 Equalization through taxes is usually a divisive issue <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Johnson, 1973)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>
; but one cannot have local control, participation and local representation without taxation and accountability. <#/>The conflicts and constraints surrounding tax policy imply the need for important 
tax reforms or improvements in the application of the present tax systems <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Tazi, 1978; Davis, 1980)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>.
\par }{<#/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 Secondary education is unnecessarily expensive, it is: boarding, biased, urbane, one-shift system, uses European-type buildings, and with no realistic space norms. <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
To reduce the costs of secondary schools in Tanzania, Malekela and Galabawa (1986a) gave four strategies: (1) better utilization of present resources (2) the use of day schools rather than boarding schools, (3) the use of cheaper buildings
, and (4) mobilization of the people to put up rural and district schools. <#/>Comparative data of a typical government secondary school, and a good quality private Highland Secondary School in Iringa indicated that one can have 29 day schools of Highland
 Secondary type at the price of one "high quality" government boarding school <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Ministry of Education, }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 5th IDA Project, }{\v\fs24\lang2057 1981)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>.
\par <#/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 The allocation of financial resources for education has been influenced by the policies pursued in the context of social and po
litical objectives rather than in terms of efficiency indicators and effectiveness allocation formulae. <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
Generally, financial distribution formulae have not been adopted and used effectively. <#/>Innovations are still required for purposive formulae whi
ch could: equalize expenditures per unit, equalize education output, increase attendance rates, induce curriculum changes, and reduce wastage. <#/>Schools which attain high levels of efficiency are not rewarded accordingly.
\par <#/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 Less resources have been allocated to revitalization. <#/>Consequently, the quality of education at all levels has been going down in the light of decreasing quality inputs. <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
The infrastructure that was put up for education has been deteriorating over time: torn textbooks, no main
tenance of equipment and physical plant. <#/>Generally, there is an imbalance between salary and non-salary recurrent expenditures. <#/>And within the salary expenditures, there is an imbalance in favour of non-teaching salary expenditures <X_>}{
\v\fs24\lang2057 (Galabawa, 1986b)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>.
\par <#/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 Expansion of education services over time has not been selective and in favour of socially profitable investment. <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
The fiscal crisis that Tanzania is facing now calls for selective expansion of education services. <#/>For example, more resources 
will have to go to basic-primary education (than tertiary education), new approaches to providing secondary and higher education at modest levels, and programmes that do not generate more recurrent expenditures. <#/>These programmes include expansion of a
ccess for part time fee paying students.
\par <#/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 Non-Government Organization (NGO) activity is essential. <#/>However, the degree of NGO operational freedom depends on the extent of government regulation and usually strong NGO activity tends, in turn, to attrac
t foreign funds. <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 This principle allows the establishment of privately owned and privately financed institutions, especially at higher and secondary education level, provided they operate under state set standards.

, and in the realities of fiscal capacity constraints, both the central Government and dono
r support in the field of educational finance have to grapple with the principles of access, quality, funding, equity, requisition, and flexibility. <#/>They also have to address the role of central Government }{\i\fs24\lang2057 vis-a-vis }{
\fs24\lang2057 decentralization, and efficiency and effectiveness (or the mandate of education managers) in financing.
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 Access Financing </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Every student has the right of access to a standard and quality primary education. <#/>And depending on student ability as indicated by the National Exam
ination and on the regional quota, a student must have the opportunity to acquire secondary and higher education.
\par <#/>Compensatory education, coupled with disproportional allocation of resources and inputs in favour of less privileged regions, would have m
ore far-reaching effects than reliance on quotas. <#/>There is no evidence to show that the system has helped backward regions to catch up at higher levels <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Mosha and Omari, 1987)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>.
\par <#/>The scope of adding evening and vacation courses to increase students access to secondary and university levels has not been exploited. <#/>Some recommendations on maximum capacity utilization as given by the Ministry of Education, 5th IDA Project Rep
ort (1981) have not been implemented. <#/>These include: the use of rotation system, the double shift system, better utilization of teachers and physical facilities. <#/>An improvement in these areas can increase access to education.
\par <#/>Different countries
 have several ways of equalizing education access. <#/>For example, equalization can be achieved through central regulations and financing. <#/>On the other hand, regulations can be moderate and most of the financing can be generated at the local level. <
#
/>However, as pointed out by Schiefelbein (1983), many social aspects have to be considered when proposing new ways of promoting access to education. <#/>Changes in the present arrangements would probably negatively affect groups which now benefit from th
e system.
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 Quality Financing </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Recent studies indicate that the quality of schooling at all levels is low. <#/>This is true for primary education <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Mosha, 1988; Omari et al., 1983; Criper and Dodd, 1983)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>
, and also true at the secondary level, <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Cooksey, 1987; World Bank/UNESCO, 1981; Daily News, 1985)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>.
\par <#/>The solution to the above quality problem needs to be both internally and externally consistent. <#/>Internally, more resources need to be diverted to teaching and learning variables. <#/>Exte
rnally, the funding units ought to concentrate on teacher training and textbook publishing. <#/>Studies by Heyneman and Jamison (1980), and Heyneman and Loxley (1983) indicated that teacher quality and textbook availability are major determinants of schoo
l quality in low income countries (LICs).
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 Equity Financing </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 School units must have access to sufficient resources to provide quality education that meets the national needs. <#/>Since local resources and costs vary, some schools and individ
uals require more central Government funding than others to meet their education obligation. <#/>For example; by June 1988, the cost of cement in Dar es Salaam was Tshs. 350/= per bag. <#/>The same bag was selling at Tshs. 750/= (open market) in Bukoba, K
a
gera Region. <#/>Hence, it costs more to put up one classroom in Bukoba than in Dar es Salaam. <#/>Accordingly, it does not make sense to dish out equal amounts of flat-grants and other subventions to Regions because of per-capita income differences acros
s the Regions.
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 Right to Requisition and Financing </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Regulations on the right to requisition can hinder efforts towards educational resources mobilization and allocation. <#/>School boards need to have access to some locally raised revenue-ta
x or non-tax if they are to function with local autonomy and local accountability.
\par <#/>At higher education levels, revenue raised through local efforts e.g. consultancy, productive activities, grants, etc, should be retained and used to bridge the gaps in 
the relevant departments. <#/>Also, at the primary school level, the school units and boards should have options to use some resources on local tasks such as repairs and maintenance of plants. <#/>The units and boards must however, be accountable to their
 localities or financiers: villagers for primary schools, Regions for secondary schools, Faculty and Council for Universities.
\par <#/>All schools are subject to Government regulations. <#/>The Government claims regulations exist to protect communities from exp
loitation, and also to allow maintenance of some uniformity in the system. <#/>The legal requirements are sometimes extensive, and they include regulations on building design, curriculum, class size, qualifications of teachers, school fees, and school boa
rds of governors. <#/>Such laws, in fact, cannot be thoroughly enforced. <#/>The preparedness of the Government to relax control in order to encourage communities to make greater inputs is essential.
\par <#/>The Government is very ambivalent about the existence
 of school fees. <#/>It had gained popular acclaim through policies to abolish fees; but now it is <-/embarassed> because fees have crept back into the system. <#/>It is argued that fees are <-/inegalitarian> and discriminatory. <#/>But at the higher leve
ls, it is the high socioeconomic status pupils who gain entrance. <#/>These are the people who can afford to pay and need to pay.
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 Flexibility in Financing </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The principle of flexibility relates to two areas. <#/>At the central level, the Gov
ernment should continue to provide leadership and direction but must be flexible in the allocation of grants to Regions in response to regional needs and society trends by, for example, providing specific purpose grants. <#/>The second area pertains to fl
e
xibility in the use of vote funds by the units. <#/>Presently, it is not possible for the warrant of fund holders (accounting officer) to economize on some items and then transfer funds to other items of expenditure depending on local needs and circumstan
ces. <#/>For example, all school purchases have to be done from Government allowed suppliers or through tenderers selected by the Regional Tender Boards. <#/>This procedure does not allow the warrant holders to buy from cheaper sources.
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 Efficiency and Effectiveness in Financing </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Two efficiency areas are relevant here; efficiency in allocation and efficiency in financial management. <#/>I have argued elsewhere <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Galabawa, 1986b)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X> 
that resource allocation trends favour higher or university education at the ex\-pense of lower levels. <#/>A recent study <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Galabawa, 1988)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X> 
indicated that, in fact, investments in primary education have greater payoffs than investment in secon\-dary or university schooling. <#/>Therefore, a move to reinvest more in primar
y education, which is terminal but otherwise more socially profitable, will also advance the peasant farmer as most peasant farmers in Tanzania are primary school graduates. <#/>A change in the distribution of educational resources towards primary schools
 will benefit low socio-economic groups who are usually the majority at this level.
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Usually social returns are less than private ones because of the financing arrangements for education. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Since high university gains will definitely lead to high demand for this type of schooling, there is room for the Government to reduce the subsidies on higher education. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
One level of schooling should not be financed at the expense of others. 
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Research evidence indicated that at the secondary school level, the in\-
troduction of pre-vocational studies could not be justified on the basis of their economic payoff being greater than for academic schooling (Psacharopolous, 1984). }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Recurrent costs were a
 quarter greater, for schools with biases, than for traditional academic schools. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Building costs were high and expensive, and yet other buildings remained unused because the Government had failed to pro\-
vide equipment (Omari, 1984).
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Related to revenue allocation is the question of financial management and control. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
The education Departments and Institutions are not usually given the opportunity to evaluate and recommend Accounting Officers appointed to run and manage the units. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Evaluation and recommendation rest with the appoint\-
ing authorities and, hence, accountability rests with the central appointing body. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Since the appointing authorities are very far from the spending units, and there\-fore cannot monitor daily financial operations, co
sts escalate unnecessarily while finances are mismanaged at the same time. }{\fs24\lang2057 </X></I>

\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 Introduction </h>}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The source of errors in second language learning has of late been a controversial topic. <#/>Contradictory reasons as to why errors occur are usually given, ranging from native language-hence Ll transfer I <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
(Lado 1957)}{\fs24\lang2057 </x> - to strategies employed by the learner <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Schachter 1974)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>. <#/>
These conclusions are theoretically based on two versions of contrastive analysis-strong and weak. <#/>Proponents of the strong version claim that one can compare two languages to determine similarities and differences in structure-similarities being easi
e
r to learn while differences are not (Predictionalists). <#/>On the other hand, proponents of weak version use the concept as a tool to account for errors which actually occur without prediction (Non predictionalists). <#/>Our approach is mainly based on 
a weak version hypothesis of contrastive analysis.
\par <#/>The conclusions made in previous studies have been obtained using the data of languages other than Bantu-to which Swahili belongs. <#/>The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to analyse performance dat
a obtained from English speakers learning Swahili - a Bantu language. <#/>We are interested in pointing out the kinds of errors made and their possible sources. <#/>Our specific aim is to test Jain's <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (1974)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>
 hypothesis that errors are traceable to both L1 and other-than-L1 source. <#/>By using the Swahili data, we want to prove or disprove this hypothesis.
\par <#/>A preliminary comment is in order at this stage: the qualitative aspect of the study. <#/>The study makes no claim to completeness, since it is not in
tended as a statistical count, but merely a tentative probe which might suggest some points for further investigation.
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 Method and Data Analysis </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Two groups of English speaking learners of Swahili were used: six students of intermediate lev
el referred to as group 1, and four students of advanced level, referred to as group 2. <#/>They were given numbers 1-10 so that their identity is just known to the author only.
\par <#/>Students' class work of free compositions throughout the term was analyzed
. <#/>Because of limited time and the scope of the paper, only two kinds of errors were looked at: grammatical agreement and word order. <#/>2. Grammatical errors are defined as grammatical markers departing from the Swahili norm, which a native Swahili s
peaker would not accept as grammatical. <#/>Similarly, word order errors are a sequence of words in a sentence departing from the Swahili norm which too, a native Swahili speaker would consider unacceptable in stan\-dard Swahili.
\par <#/>It is proper here too, t
o mention briefly the characteristics of Kiswahili grammatical agreement. <#/>In Swahili, there exist various sets of nouns classified under different classes. <#/>Such classes are normally, though not invariably, distinguished by <-/evert> markers. <#/>S
i
milar markers usually occur with other parts of speech as adjectives, verbs, pronominals etc., and the choice of a marker for each part of speech corresponds to, or is determined by the set to which the noun indicated belongs, that is, the noun gender and
/or class, as shown in the following sentences:
\par A total of thirty compositions - three from  each student were analyzed. <#/>Each composition consisted of approximately half a page (handwritten). <#/>In total, the compositions consisted of about 270 sentenc
es of approximately 2,700 words. <#/>Using the data, a goal was set to answer the following questions: (1) What is the error?; <#/>(2) What is the possible source of the error?; <#/>(3)Is there any relationship between group 1 and Group 2 in the errors t
hey make? <#/>. <#/>If so, what conclusions can we make?; <#/>(4) Apart from English, what other languages have students studied?; }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Does that have anything to do with learning the second language?
\par <#/>By answering these questions, we hope to determine a probable cause of errors. <#/>This might help to evaluate our hypothesis.
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 Results of Data Analysis and Interpretations </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The following section shows the results obtained from the study and their interpretations. <#/>The first sub-section deals with the results of grammatical agree\-
ment errors, and the second and third sub-sections deal with the number of errors made by each group, and the subjects' knowledge of other foreign lan\-guages respectively. <#/>Sub-section four shows errors in word order and their pos\-
sible sources. <#/>In the final sub-section, we present the observations made from the data.
\par <#/>Grammatical agreement errors were analyzed as to what kind of errors they were, as shown in Table 1:
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 In Table 1, the results indicat
e that the most common errors are the use of inappropriate markers. <#/>Out of the total of 46 errors, 32 (70%) are errors that constitute the use of inappropriate markers. <#/>Furthermore, of these errors, the errors in possessive markers seem to be ramp
a
nt, followed by inappropriate use of the subject prefix. <#/>There are two possible explanations for this: (1) that agreement markers are most frequently used in Swahili and hence the most likely area for students to make errors. <#/>(2) in view of their 
f
requency, the learner uses a variety of methods to learn them. <#/>These methods may include, among others, generalization, simplification, inappropriate mastery of the rules, avoidance, etc. <#/>The following few examples support the point above. <#/>(a)

\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The results in Table 1 further indicate that error
s made by advanced students, i.e. 28 (61%) were qualitatively higher than those made by intermediate students. <#/>This might seem contradictory on surface level in that the advanced students are expected to make less errors than intermediate students. <#
/
>But in practice, the advanced students wrote more lengthy compositions than the intermediate students. <#/>In addition, with more exposure to the language, they feel more secure to "venture out" on their own. <#/>This adventurism included the use of othe
r language aspects not yet within the reach of intermediate students. <#/>The results appear to be consistent with Taylor's <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (1975:73)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X> 
theory, which considers second language acquisition to be an actively creative process depending on a student's ability to 
assimilate and subsume new information into already existing cognitive structure. <#/>Thus far, the data seem to support our hypothesis. <#/>Some of the errors are traceable to language transfer/interference, whereas others are not easily accounted for.

\par <#/>Table 2 indicates that the highest number of errors was 14 (32%) made by student No. 7 of group 2, and the lowest was 1 made by students 2 and 4, both from group 2. <#/>The data further indicate that errors which are common to intermediate students ar
e also common among advanced students.
\par <#/>These results seem to suggest that the source of errors is at least a similar pattern of results. <#/>The results show a difference among individuals and between the groups.
\par <#/>In Table 3, (z) represents studying 
a foreign language for a year or more, (x) represents studying a foreign language for less than a year and (-) represents no exposure to any foreign language. <#/>Table 3 shows that seven subjects have been exposed to foreign languages. <#/>Out of those s
even, three had at least one year or more at the college level doing more than one foreign language. <#/>The other three subjects have never studied any foreign language apart from Swahili, which they are studying now.
\par <#/>Compared to Table 2, three interpretations can be made: First there is no correlation between the subject's knowledge or non-knowledge of other for\-
eign language and the one they are studying now. <#/>This means, therefore, that other foreign languages are not sources of errors they make in Swahili. <#/>Neverthe\-
less, this point has to be viewed with caution. <#/>The results of Table 2 and 3 are in no way a guarantee that the subjects are not influenced by the strategies they used in learning other foreign languages. <#/>They may be applyin
g the same or similar strategies in learning the new foreign language. <#/>These strategies may not strictly be a source of errors, but might lead the subjects to make errors. <#/>To test this hypothesis, a separate experiment is in order.
\par <#/>Secondly, si
nce some subjects have studied other foreign languages and not made the same kinds of errors, the knowledge of the other foreign languages has nothing to do with making these errors. <#/>Such a conclusion has its limitation too. <#/>A possible alternative
 explanation is that Swahili and other Bantu languages have a peculiar characteristic of grammatical agreements. <#/>Because this aspect of the language is totally different from the languages known to the sub\-
jects, in learning this new language, they have nothing to refer to.
\par <#/>Thirdly, we assume that errors in agreement in Swahili might probably be due to interference within the language, that is, between various functions of agreement system.
\par <#/>In the following section we show errors in word order and hypothesize what their possible sources are as indicated in Table 4.
\par <#/>The results in Table 4 indicate that errors in word order are more common in Group 1 than they are in Group 2. <#/>Out of a total of 26 errors only 10 (38%) were made by Group 2, wh
ereas Group 1 made 16 (62%) errors. <#/>The results further indicate that errors made by Group 1 are traceable to what we have termed "other" (not transfer-oriented) (23%)}{\fs24\lang2057\super .
\par <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 From the results in Table 4, one conclusion can be made: in this aspect of the 
Swahili language (word order), transfer from Ll is probably the main source of errors. <#/>This is logical; for a learner relies on what he already knows when confronted with a new language situation. <#/>In this case, it is also logical that an intermedi
a
te language learner knows less, although this might differ between individuals, of the target language than a more advanced learner. <#/>The intermediate learner will, therefore, need to rely more heavily on Ll or other L2s. <#/>As he learns more about th
e target language, the errors will decrease, as is the case with Group 2.
\par <#/>The results in Table 4 support our hypothesis. <#/>The same conclusions were reached by other scholars like Taylor <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (1974:74)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>, who summarized his work by arguing that acquisition i
s a creative process which involves the learner as a creative participant; then, the learner will make errors which indicate that he is dealing with the target language directly and without an extensive reliance on his native language. <#/>It is shown abo
ve that errors are not based on trans\-fer from L1 alone but also from other-than Ll.
\par <#/>Further evidence for this conclusion is presented in Table 5. <#/>This is an elaboration of Table 4, with examples drawn from the compositions.
\par <#/>The data in Table 5 indicate that the sources of errors in word order in Swahili are not only traceable to subjects' Ll (English) but also to other-than Ll, referred to here as Interlanguage.
\par <#/>A similar conclusion was reached by Duskova' <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (1969:16)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X> who examined writing samp
les from 50 postgraduate Czech students writing in English. <#/>She found that "interference from the mother tongue was plainly obvious in errors in word order and sentence construction, i.e. on the syntactic level".
\par <#/>In conclusion, however, Duskova' <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (1969:24)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X> admitted that "a large number of errors could not be traced back to interference from the mother tongue, but rather were intralingual in nature".
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 Observations </h>}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The differences of errors made in agreement as well as in word order between Group 1 and Group 2 provide interesting observations.
\par <#/>Errors which are most common for the intermediate and advanced subjects tend to indicate that increased proficiency in Swahili does not, in a strict sense, qualitatively affect the 'kinds' of 
errors which a learner makes. <#/>While the advanced subjects made fewer errors in word order and many in agreement, their most frequent errors were usually the errors which the intermediate subjects made most frequently. <#/>This case is similar for most
 of us who are non-native speakers of English; we are still making a lot of errors in the use of articles regardless of our proficiency in English.
\par <#/>Tied to the argument above is the role of the individual. <#/>It is possible to hypothesize that individu
als differ slightly in their strategies of language learning, specifically, in the case of agreement in Swahili. <#/>This was revealed in the data by the fact that the individuals' errors were not qualitatively uniform. <#/>This generalization has to be t
empered by the recognition that the subjects' background differs. <#/>Had we enough time and subjects, we could have controlled the subjects in such a way that they would all have been of the same background.
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Finally, the composition task with which the data was obtained proved to be an effective and objective procedure. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Students had time to think about the compositions before handing them over to the author, unaware that their errors were to be analyzed for a paper of this kind.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 On the other hand, the results of the data and the conclusions made here are hampered by the fact that we only dealt with one task: free compositions. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Had different tasks been performed, it is possible that our results and conclusions would have been different, as were the conclusions of Lo Coco (1976). }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
In comparing the performance of the second language learners on three different tasks, she found significant differ
ences across tasks, in the percentage of errors <-/occuring> in several <-/grammarical> categories, and also in the degree to which processes such as transfer and over generalization <-/occured>.

\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 What we have offered here is evidence of one task. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 But generally, the data has provided a first step in the investigation of this topic, and through which some interesting observations can be made.

\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The results lend support to the hypothesis that many of the errors could not be explained in terms of Ll transfer only, but rather should also be seen as coming from sources other than Ll.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The data suggest that the errors of individuals in both Group 1 and Group 2 quantitatively differ, confirming again the idea that individual learners adopt different strategies in learning a language. }{\v <#/>}{
\v\fs24\lang2057 Furthermore, some errors might be due to interference between various functions of the aspect of the language, itself.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The data also suggest that another possible source of errors might be "minor" interference factors such as interference from foreign languages that are learned before the target language.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 In summary, this study suggests that in learning a second language, various strategies are adopted. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Hence errors arising out of these strategies are difficult to trace to only one source. }{\v <#/>}{
\v\fs24\lang2057 These findings are in support of Jan's (1974) hypothesis that errors are traceable to both Ll and other than Ll sources. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 However, it is difficult to accurately attribute the source of a give "error". }{\v <#/>}
{\v\fs24\lang2057 For example, while Duskova attributes an error in the use of articles to interference, Dulay and Burt (1972) classify the same error as intralingual. }{\fs24\lang2057 </X></I>
