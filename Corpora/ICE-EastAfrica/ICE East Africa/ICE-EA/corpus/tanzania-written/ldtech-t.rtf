\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 5.2.1 The Need for Clear Cooperative Development Policy }{\fs24\lang2057 </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The history of the cooperative movement in Tanzania has shown that marketing cooperatives can play an impo
rtant role in bringing about rapid social and economic development in the rural areas. <#/>Through the traditional marketing cooperatives, farmers were able not only to get rid of middlemen who were involved in buying produce in the rural areas, but were 
also able to get better prices for their crops. <#/>In this way, their standard of living rose substantially, year after year, as a result of improved bargaining power which they were able to mobilise through their cooperatives.
\par <#/>At the same time, the ma
rketing cooperatives were able to improve the productive capacities of farmers by supplying them with fertilizers, insecticides and farm implements, as well as agricultural credit at reasonable cost. <#/>Through continuous education and training, the abil
i
ty of farmers to organise themselves and to manage their cooperatives improved tremendously over the years. <#/>It is for the reason that the cooperative movement in Tanzania was once, during the late sixties, recognised as one of the best in Africa, Sout
h of Sahara.
\par <#/>However, looking back at the past events, there is no doubt that there was a lot of confusion and misunderstanding between the policy-makers and cooperators, particularly on the issues related to the ways and means of accelerating the pace of}{
\i\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 ujamaa}{\fs24\lang2057 
 programmes in the country. <#/>As a result, in the absence of clear cooperative development policy, cooperators and policy-makers found themselves at loggerheads instead of working together as partners in development. <#/>When the marketing 
cooperatives were dissolved in 1976, the farmers suffered tremendous hardships and the production of the major cash and food crops declined substantially, thus, making it impossible for the country to achieve its objectives of improving the social and eco
nomic conditions of farmers and the attainment of self-sufficiency in food.
\par <#/>There is, therefore an urgent need for Tanzania to prepare a comprehensive cooperative development policy document which, besides minimising conflicts of interest, will guide co
operatives towards the set objectives. <#/>The need for such a document is felt much more now than ever before because of the past failures. <#/>As it has been revealed earlier in this work, already at this stage of implementation of the new cooperative p
rogramme, conflicts of interest have come to the surface regarding the role of cooperatives in the new set-up.
\par <#/>One group of development strategists believes that the newly established rural cooperatives should be given all the necessary support to enabl
e them to provide vital services which farmers need; the other is of the opinion that the cooperatives should be seen as a temporary solution to the problem of bringing about socialist change in the country. <#/>In terms of policy, the issue in this case 
i
s not who is right or who is wrong, but what steps to take next to move Tanzanians from where they are to a position of prosperity, where disease, ignorance and hunger will be less threat to their lives. <#/>The best way to approach the problem will be to
 work out a common strategy which takes care of the needs of the people and the socio-economic realities prevailing in the country.
\par <#/>Essentially, both development strategies offer possibilities for Tanzanians to move towards prosperity. <#/>As tools of d
evelopment, particularly at this stage where there is need to motivate farmers to change their attitudes towards development, cooperatives have a lot to offer. <#/>Though cooperative farmers will be able, besides getting various services which are necessa
r
y for improving their productive capacities, improve their skills in tackling their problems in order to achieve social and economic prosperity. <#/>In the opinion of the first group of strategists, development, as a process of positive change, should be 
encouraged in all possible ways. <#/>As such, it is not a question of an infant millipede asking its mother which leg to use first in order to move but rather to move by all means, regardless of which leg should start first.
\par <#/>The validity of the argument
 of the second group of development strategists, on the other hand, is based on the fact that development, in Tanzania would be meaningful only if it took place within a socialist framework which guaranteed equality, justice and democracy. <#/>As a develo
p
ment strategy, the strategists see the possibility of increasing productive capacities of the country directly by encouraging farmers to produce communally, thus making it possible for them to benefit from the advantages of large scale operations. <#/>In 
t
his context the socialist strategy will offer possibilities of faster growth because it will be relatively easier to influence groups to accept changes than would be the case with individuals in their scattered homesteads. <#/>In the opinion of the group,
 it is important to nip the capitalist tendencies of society, in the bud in order to avoid the risks of class conflicts.
\par <#/>What is at issue in both cases is whether cooperatives can be used to bring about development which will be in line with the thinkin
g of the two groups. <#/>As regards the first group, the issue does not present a problem because cooperatives, as tools of development, are acceptable. <#/>Maybe the question which will need to be answered is whether co-operatives should be regarded as t
o
ols for enhancing self-reliance and autonomy of members or as development agencies of government. <#/>Cooperative development policy which aims at promoting cooperatives as self-reliant organisations of members will emphasise the need to allow members' fr
e
edom and autonomy to participate in their development activities (i.e. development of the people by the people and for their own interests and needs). <#/>The strategy for promoting cooperatives which are development agencies of government will emphasise 
the need for government to play predominant a role in identifying and implementing cooperative programmes, according to its needs and priorities.
\par <#/>As regards the role of cooperatives under the socialist system, as represented by the second group of devel
opment strategies, there will be need to clarify whether socialism will be promoted from above (imposed) or from below (through conviction). <#/>The strategy for promoting socialism from above will emphasise the predominant role of government in decisions
 and implementation of development programmes. <#/>In such a situation the role of cooperatives as self-help organisations will be less relevant.
\par <#/>The strategy for promoting socialism from below, on the other hand, will emphasise the need for education, 
motivation and provision of possibilities to allow farmers to learn by doing. <#/>The strategy will emphasise effective participation of farmers in their development programmes and less interference from government. <#/>In such a situation, cooperatives, 
as tools for enhancing self-reliance of members, will have a major role to play in mobilising and preparing farmers to move on the long journey towards socialism.
\par <#/>On their long march towards socialism, farmers need agricultural inputs, efficient marketi
ng channels, and orientation in their attitudes towards development, a high level of skills to manage and control their rural organisations and, above all, they need to be prepared to meet the challenges of the future. <#/>In cooperative development polic
y, rural cooperatives should be seen in the light of fulfilling such important tasks. <#/>In this case, cooperatives should facilitate and enhance the promotion of socialism and self-reliance.
\par <#/>As noted in the report on the ICA/FAO/ILO Inter-agency Missi
on to Tanzania, in support of cooperative development, Tanzania has had no formal statement of cooperative development policy. <#/>As such the Mission appealed to the policy makers to implement the recommendation of the Gaborone Ministerial Conference whi
c
h stated that "a clear and coherent cooperative development policy statement, providing written guidelines and an operational framework, is an indispensable means of securing coordinated and sustained cooperative growth in accordance with the political, e
conomic and social objectives of a country".
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 5.2.2 Main Considerations when Formulating Cooperative Development Policy </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 (a) Lessons drawn from past experience
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Fortunately, the history of cooperatives in Tanzania offers very rich experien
ces which could be used to provide guidance for the future. <#/>In the course of history, cooperatives in Tanzania were subjected to various changes, either as a result of policy orientations or as a response to members' needs and wishes. <#/>In order to 
provide a basis for further discussions the following observations are revisited:
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 1. Most cooperatives which were established during the colonial era were characterised by effective grassroot support from members. <#/>The identity between the interests 
of members and those of cooperatives was so close that, at times, members were prepared to sacrifice themselves to face the wrath of colonial rulers when the interests of their cooperatives were also used to protect the interests of members in their fight
 
against colonialism. <#/>The main reason behind such support was that cooperatives were regarded by members as self-help organisations which aimed at enhancing their economic and political autonomy. <#/>At the same time members, as owners, determined, to 
a
 high degree how their cooperatives should be organised, managed and controlled. <#/>The promotional strategy in such cooperatives represented development from below and from within the membership itself. <#/>Where such a strategy was not applied (e.g. co
operatives in Ngara), members' participation was less effective and the cooperatives were weaker and ineffective as tools of development.
\par <#/>2. After independence, cooperatives were characterised by a lot of dynamism which reflected the enthusiasm of the g
overnment and members to fight economic stagnation and maintain a national identity in business through cooperatives. <#/>However, from 1961 to 1966, members' enthusiasm towards their cooperatives dwindled. <#/>As a result, some cooperatives either fell b
y
 the wayside or were maintained artificially. <#/>There was a national outcry. <#/>Members complained that cooperatives were not representing their interests. <#/>Corruption and fraud became the order of the day. <#/>This situation was brought about by th
ree important factors:
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 (i) Government's enthusiasm to use cooperatives as tools of development, particularly in those areas where there were no cooperatives, found expression in the amendment of the Act in 1963 to allow cooperatives to be formed for pol
itical reasons. <#/>Cooperatives were, therefore, formed regardless of whether they were viable or there was genuine interest from members. <#/>This pattern of development was strengthened in 1963 when the National Agricultural and Products Board (NAPB) w
a
s formed to deal with food crops like maize, paddy, groundnuts etc. <#/>The Board facilitated the establishment of cooperatives in order to handle these crops. <#/>Cooperatives formed in this way represented a top-down development approach. <#/>In such a 
situation, it was rare that the interests of the cooperatives which were established were identical to those members. <#/>The most serious problem was that members did not know the rules of the game.
\par <#/>ii) Government's enthusiasm to use cooperatives as to
ols of development made the Cooperative Development Department play a predominant role in initiating and implementing cooperative programmes because of the belief that cooperative members were unable to do so on their own. <#/>From 1961 to 1968, governmen
t
 influence in the affair of cooperatives was so great that members began to cast doubts whether the cooperatives were theirs, as provided by the bye-laws or they belonged to the government. <#/>Members' fears were based on three main factors. <#/>First, m
e
mbers' influence and participation in the affairs of their cooperatives had been replaced by the government. <#/>Second, the government had, without consulting the members, involved cooperatives in activities which were not related to their needs and inte
r
ests. <#/>Third, after the 1968 Act which gave the Registrar of Cooperatives wide ranging powers to intervene directly in the affairs of the cooperatives, members saw their representatives and officials removed and far-reaching changes in their cooperativ
es instituted without their approval.
\par <#/>As a result of increasing government involvement, the identity of cooperatives changed from <-/statei>-sponsored - where government participation was limited to measures which aimed at providing favourable condition
s for development of cooperatives - to state-controlled - as characterised by direct government intervention in the affairs of the cooperatives. <#/><-/State controlled> cooperatives are cooperatives in name only (by legal recognition) but not substance b
ecause their aims are not to enhance the self-reliance to members but to promote the goals and objectives of the government.
\par <#/>(iii) Corruption and fraud which became common place problems in cooperatives should be seen in the light of great expectations 
of Tanzanians after independence to gain materials benefit, either as compensation for their efforts in fighting for independence or as a logical trend of behaviour in a situation where society suddenly changed from a position characterised by scarcity an
d poverty to a position of abundance and wealth, particularly where there were no professional ethics and controls to curb such malpractices. <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
<#/>It is important to note that corruption and fraud took place despite the increased government involvement in supervising and controlling the financial transactions undertaken by cooperatives.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 3. Attempts by the government to bring about rapid development in rural areas through the establishment of settlement schemes failed because of high capital investment
s, lack of management skills and lack of commitment by members. <#/>The settlement scheme strategy which was known as "spoon\-feeding", represented a development approach of imposing high technology in an environment which was basically not ready for it.

\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
4. Government's attempts to be paternalistic and benevolent towards the farmers by providing financial help in form of soft loans, grants and so on failed to motivate farmers to perform as desired. <#/>The assistance produced a totally different behaviou
r, where farmers felt that whatever they got from the government represented a part of their share of the national cake which others, particularly those in the urban areas have been enjoying for a long time. <#/>In such a situation, where credit was provi
ded to farmers by government there was reluctance to pay it back. <#/>Where money was provided to support specific village projects it found its way in the pockets of leaders.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 5. Attempts by the government to provide tractors and equipment to assist far
mers to improve their production failed to achieve the desired results. <#/>The failure is attributed to the same reasons as those of the settlement schemes. <#/>For farmers who are still struggling for survival, tractors and such other equipment may not 
represent their immediate needs and priorities. <#/>In fact, the tractors worked for villagers in the communal farms, thus, allowing them ample time to work on their own plots.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 6. Marketing boards/authorities which were formed to create favourable conditions for the improvement of agricultural production and marketing failed to produce satisfactory results. <#/>The main reasons for failure were:

\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (i) they undermined marketing cooperatives (instead of helping them to achieve the desired objectives) by making it difficult for them to operate efficiently.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (ii) they grew into big bureaucracies which absorbed a large portion of the income of the farmers.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 iii) they were insensitive to the needs and wishes of farmers. <#/>Farmers had little say, if any, in the activities of the boards/authorities.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (iv) they were inefficient and corrupt.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (v) they were more concerned with their own survival (as organisations) than with bringing about change and development in the rural areas.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 7. Efforts by th
e government to introduce a two tier marketing system where villages sold their produce directly to marketing boards/authorities failed. <#/>The system was based on the fact that by allowing villages to sell directly to marketing boards/authorities (inste
a
d of selling through the cooperative unions) a substantial amount of money could be saved for the benefit of farmers. <#/>The cooperative channel was done away with in 1976 because the government felt it was costing the farmers too much to maintain it. <#
/
>Government and the Party also feared that the cooperative channel (the unions) harboured capitalistic tendencies. <#/>The failure of the two tier marketing system proved that cooperatives, as self-help organisations of farmers, are more effective and eff
icient than the marketing boards/authorities. <#/>Furthermore, since the co\-operative infrastructure aims at enhancing the economic and political power of members, its activities would respond to their needs, whether they are socialist or capitalist.

\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 8. Cooperative legislation has failed to create a favourable climate for the promotion of viable cooperatives in the country. <#/>The ineffectiveness of the legislation is attributed to:
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (i) failure to respond to the needs of cooperatives.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (ii) giving the government excessive powers at, the expense of members.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (iii) the legislations consisted of a lot of contradictions which made implementation of cooperative projects more difficult.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (iv) failure to pay adequate attention to the capacities of farmers to develop themselves.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (b) Problems of Implementing the <ea/>Ujamaa Programmes in Tanzania After the announcement of the Arusha Declaration in 1967, Tanzania opted for a socialist development strategy which is based on African cultural values. 
<#/>The validity of Tanzania's decision to base its development on such a strategy should be seen in the light of the economic and political problems which she faces, as an agricultural country. }{\fs24\lang2057 </X></I>

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 INTRODUCTION </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Marketing planning is closely associated with budgets. <#/>In many firms, sales activity is regarded as an essential input for production.
\par <#/>Many of the individual marketing functions are thought of as being inevitably high cost. <#/>This is largely due to the well publicised and heavy expenditure laid out by producers of consumer goods on
 such functions as advertising, distribution, market research and Public Relations.
\par <#/>The marketing budget ensures that the financial resources available to the department <-_is><+_are> effectively allocated to such activities as Product Planning Researc
h and Development, Test Marketing, Marketing Research, Public Relations, Promotion, Physical Distribution and other activities of the Marketing Department.
\par <#/>To carry out }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  marketing programme, there is a need to prepare estimates on resources to be committed and the expected revenue. <#/>The marketing budget is that aspect of }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>
}{\fs24\lang2057  planning process which deals with the statements on marketing costs and their contribution to the organizations revenue.
\par <#/>In this article, the focus is on the concept of }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057 
 marketing budget, its relation to the corporate budget, the budget planning process, its components and how it is monitored and assessed. <#/>A quantitative method for }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057 
 promotion budget has been described. <#/>The final section discusses the application of the concept of }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  marketing budget by looking at a hypothetical situation involving National Distributors Ltd.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 THE CONCEPT OF BUDGETING </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The word "budget" is considered to have originated from the Middle Age English word "budget" which means a budget or wallet.
\par <#/>In England the word "budget" was applied for a long period to the "leather bag" in which the Kings' Treasurer or Finance Minister and later the Chancellor of Exchequer carried the doc
ument explaining the country's needs and the sources of revenue to meet those needs. <#/>Eventually the meaning of the word "budget" shifted from the "bag" itself to the contents of the bag, that is the financial estimates and supporting statement of acco
unts.
\par <#/>The word "Budget" acquired several meanings over a number of years, until it was finally taken to mean the document showing the financial estimates and supporting statements of accounts. <#/>It is clear therefore that different scholars have defin
ed a "budget" in different ways }{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Meigs and Johnson, l980)}{\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>Eric Kohler has defined a "budget" as a pattern for and control over future operations. <#/>Herman G. Heiser on the other hand has defined budget as an overall "blue print" of a comprehensive p
lan of operation and actions, expressed in financial terms. <#/>A budget may also be expressed in financial terms or in terms of labour hours, units of products, or any other numerically measurable term.
\par <#/>However, a working definition for this paper loo
ks at a budget as a monetary or quantitative expression of a plan of action and an aid to co-ordinate an implementation for a specific period of time. <#/>"Budgeting" therefore describes a continuous process by which financial estimates regarding the amou
nt of manpower, material and other resources required by government, business <-_firm><+_firms> or other bodies to perform planned activities, e.g. marketing are made. <#/>The output of the budgeting process is the budget.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 FUNCTIONS OF BUDGETS </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 From different expressions as to the definition of budget, one could say that a budget is a management and accounting tool which when administered intelligently <-_facilitate><+_facilitates> the following functions:
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 a) Compliments planning and plan implementation
\par On many occasions, every day problems interfere with the idea of planning ahead 
\par Operations drift along until time catches the firms in undesirable situations that could 
\par have been anticipated and avoided. <#/>Budgets formulate expected per
formance. <#/>They express managerial targets without which operations may lack direction, problems are unforeseen, results lack meaning and future policies are dwarfed by the pressure of the present circumstances. <#/>Furthermore, Budgets have direct or 
indirect influence on strategies.
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 b) Promote communication and coordination
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Budgets help management to coordinate in several ways:
\par }{<#/>}{\field\flddirty{\*\fldinst {\fs24\lang2057 SYMBOL 183 \\f "Symbol" \\s 10 \\h}}{\fldrslt }}{\fs24\lang2057  The existence of a well-laid plan is a\tab major step towards achieving coordin
ation. <#/>Executives are forced to think of relationships among individual operations and the company as a whole.
\par <#/>}{\field\flddirty{\*\fldinst {\fs24\lang2057 SYMBOL 183 \\f "Symbol" \\s 10 \\h}}{\fldrslt }}{\fs24\lang2057  Budgets broaden individual thinking by removing unconscious biases on the part of employees in the various units of organizations.
\par <#/>}{\field\flddirty{\*\fldinst {\fs24\lang2057 SYMBOL 183 \\f "Symbol" \\s 10 \\h}}{\fldrslt }}{\fs24\lang2057 
 Budgets search out weaknesses in the organizational structure. <#/>The formulation and administration of budgets isolate problems of communication, fixing responsibility and of working relationship.
\par <#/>c) Framework for judging performance
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Employees do not like to fumble along. <#/>The budget meets this difficulty by letting employees know what is expected out of them. <#/>Budgeting forms an important basis for gathering data for evaluating performance.
\par <#/>d) Providing guidance for allocating resources
\par Budgets aid in directing capital and efforts into the most profitable channels.
\par <#/>e) Authorizing actions
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 This function seems to predominate in government budget and not-for-profit budgeting, where budget appropriations serve as authorizations and ceilings for management actions.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 THE MARKETING BUDGET </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The marketing budget is a tiny bit of entire corporate budget. <#/>It is one of the most important and the last budget which actually matches the firm with the target market.
\par <#/>The goals, strategies and planned actions allow the Marketing manager to formulate supporting budget statement for carrying out the marketing actions. <#/>In essence the marketing budget i
s an aspect of the operating budget of the company. <#/>It reflects the financial commitment to the firm's marketing operations.
\par <#/>The purpose of such budgets include:
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 1. Anticipation of the impact of various operational strategies.
\par <#/>2. Fixing responsibility for performance
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 3. Anticipating the cash consequences of operations; cash can easily be converted into resources,          
\par    and this determines the flexibility of the firm in its strategic planning.
\par <#/>4. Permit modifications in plans because it should enable the manager to detect and respond to
\par    unanticipated events as quickly as possible.
\par <#/>Composition of the marketing Budget
\par The total marketing expenditure is closely related to the number and type of functions which are included within the orbit of the marketing department.
\par <#/>The full spectrum of the marketing budget may include, Research and Development, Test Marketing, Market Research, Public Relations, advertising, pricing, sales merchandising and physical distribution.
\par <#/>As study of marketing expenditure by British manufacturing firms in 1970 indicated the following element:
\par }{\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>chart
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 As Table 1 indicates, salaries and wages accounted for the largest proportion of the expenditure (35.8%). <#/>This is not surprising becau
se marketing is a labour intensive activity. <#/>Packaging, transportation and distribution were also major items absorbing about 47% of the marketing expenditure.
\par <#/>Marketing expenditure varies significantly within industry and among different industrie
s. <#/>Firms selling directly to customers tend to have a heavy commitment to packaging and advertising, spending significantly on marketing than firms selling exclusively to industrial markets. <#/>In developing countries the absence of studies and infor
mation makes it difficult to make a judgement on marketing budgets. <#/>However, measured in terms of consumer expenditures, the trend might be the same.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 PLANNING THE MARKETING BUDGET.</h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The control of marketing expenditure, or the maximization of benefits from any given level of expenditure demands careful planning }{\v\fs24\lang2057 (West, 1975)}{\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>The major components of the plan are:
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 1) Detailed statement of what to be achieved during the planning period.
\par <#/>2) A translation of that statement into budgetary (financial) implications.
\par <#/>The result is a marketing budget related to a course of action to be taken by the firm:
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The statement of objectives should include:
\par 1. Forecasting the sales revenues
\par 2. Determining the production levels
\par 3. Determining the cost of goods sold
\par 4. Determining the operation expenses
\par 5. Determining the budgeted income statement
\par 6. Determining the cash budget
\par 7. Determining the budgeted statement of changes
\par 8. Determining the financial positions/balance sheet
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 These objectives if undertaken stage by stage, will generate an operating budget.
\par <#/>When planning the development of a budget it is necessary to distinguish between essential and peripheral marketing activities. <#/>The latter are functions which may be useful in s
upporting the major marketing activity but can be dropped without seriously affecting the sales yield in a short term.
\par <#/>Advertising and the public relations may be essential activities for a firm attempting to build an image in a new market but a luxury
 for a monopoly supplier in a well established market. <#/>Personal selling may be essential when the sales programme demands a high level of customer education on the value of the product and the credibility of each order is low and direct mail is an acc
e
ptable method of reaching customers and receiving orders. <#/>Each marketing situation should be carefully assessed and minimum acceptable approach decided on. <#/>In depth marketing information is a key input to this procedure, which implies that market 
research as well as market planning are invariably essential components of a marketing programme.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 BUDGET DECISIONS </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 One of the decisions which managers often make is how much should be spent on marketing activities especially, distribution and promotion.
\par <#/>Two methods qualitative and quantitative are used in business life. <#/>Qualitative methods for determining marketing budgets are based on:
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 1) All you can afford i.e. there is no specific rule or method for determining the amount to be spent.
\par <#/>2) The budget as a percentage of sales e.g. for the Board of Internal Trade (BIT) Companies 5-6 percent of sales is allowed to be used for promotion. <#/>This percentage is determined by the management for individual group companies.
\par <#/>Quantitative methods, which may be either simple or complex exist, and are used to good advantage.
\par <#/>A quantitative method for setting a promotion budget, might be discussed by drawing upon information gleaned from the literature }{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Alderson and Green, 1964)}{\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>Assume that a given firm sold a quantity Q in a particular period by spending an amount X on promotion. <#/>While the firm maintains a fixed cost of F and a variable unit cost V, it sold each unit at price P.
\par <#/>If the quantity Q sold is explained by the function
\par }{\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/> formula
\par }{\fs24\lang2057 and that the parameters assume the following values: a = 30,000 units of merchandise and b = 1000 the trend under various assumed value of X is shown in Fig. 1 
\par The chart shows that the firm will sell Q = 30,000 units of merchandis
e, even if no money was spent on promotion. <#/>This may be attributed to the effects of past promotional efforts, consumer loyalty, shortages, word-of-mouth communication among consumers (especially in developing countries), etc. <#/>The chart also shows
 that equal increments of promotion expenses lead eventually to smaller increments in Sales, a reflection of the concept of diminishing returns.
\par <&/> charts and formulas
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The above calculations are based on several assumptions. <#/>First that values of a
ll the variables are known for certain. <#/>Second the chosen functions are continuous, differentiable and that only local maximum or minimum are identified. <#/>When one must deal with non-continuous functions, involving several  variables the assumption
 would not be tenable.
\par <#/>No matter what type of quantitative method is used, there is always an element of judgment. <#/>It depends on the objective to be achieved. <#/>It is <-/worth while> to be more practical. <#/>In most cases many companies use what 
they can afford. <#/>A caution should be raised here that promotion expenditure should not be determined in isolation from the rest of the other marketing mix variables.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Assessing the budget </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 By focusing the cost of the marketing functions,
 firms have a tendency to regard costs as the only criterion by which to evaluate their marketing programmes. <#/>"We'll do it if we can afford it," is a common sentiment when appraising specific marketing proposals, when in many situations firms should b
e asking,}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct}{\fs24\lang2057  whether they "can we afford to do it?" }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>Marketing costs must be related to the benefits which can accrue from the expenditure and provided the cost/benefit equation is <-/favorable> the expenditure may be considered worthw
hile. <#/>Much of the marketing expenditure is a long term investment because it establishes }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057 
 company's reputation and image in the market place and generates new products which will sustain the company's future business.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Monitoring the marketing budget </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 No marketing plan can be regarded as complete unless an effective monitoring system is incorporated within the programme of activities. <#/>Certainly the marketer needs to know what he has spent and the effects of his expenditure 
in improving his profit. <#/>A constant review of the monitoring process in relation to expenditure serves another important purpose. <#/>It facilitates scrutinizing the performance of the marketing personnel.
\par <#/>Budgeting periods tend to be ayear or six months, yet the effect of the expenditure can be seen well before that period is up.

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Introduction </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The paper presents a brief and tentative account of an environmental disaster
 relief coordination network in Tanzania. <#/>The proposal points to the need to establish a sound network based on the utilization of available local resources.
\par <#/>Generally a disaster may be described as a natural hazard whose <-/occurance> within a spe
cific period of time in a given place is potentially damaging to the total environment. <#/>In some instances, a disaster may also be man-made or <-/man induced> due to man's actions on the physical environment. <#/>In the final analysis, however, the act
ual damage is very much dependent upon a combination of social, economic and political factors.
\par <#/>A review of disasters that have occurred between August 1985 and April 1986 in Development Countries, for instance, shows drought, cyclones, hailstorms, floo
ds, landslides, volcanic eruptions, earth-quakes, fires, armed conflicts, among others, as the major <-/reccuring> disruptive forces to reckon with }{\v\fs24\lang2057 (UNDRO News 1986)}{\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>Experience in Developing Countries points to a pressing need to develop and strengthen their capacity to handle natural hazards problems.
\par <#/>As for Tanzania environmental disasters have in most cases inhibited socio-economic development inertia by impinging upon the welfare of the people and the security of their property. <#/>The most co
mmonly reported and indeed frequent disasters include floods, storms, and drought }{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Daily News various, Ndorobo 1973, and Ngana 1980)}{\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>Progress in science and technology, however, has contributed to the present day capacity to mitigate natural hazards although the story in Tanzania leaves much to be desired }{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Berry et. al. 1973, Burton, et. al. 1978 and Temu 1986)
}{\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>orth}{\fs24\lang2057  there is, for instance, no standard system of natural hazards information flow and as a result measures taken to combat disasters may mostly be described as too little too late .
\par <#/>The primary objectives of this paper are two-fold. <#/>Firstly, to develop a disasters relief coordination network capable of coping with environmental disaster problems whenever and wherever they occur
. <#/>This can be done firstly by training and developing a pool of expertise in all matters of disaster early warning systems (EWS), preparedness, mitigation effects of disasters and disaster relief administration to serve as focal points from village go
vernment to national level.
\par <#/>Secondly to introduce environmental protection in the socio-economic planning process by involving the relevant ministries, institutions and the masses in mitigating the disastrous effects of natural hazards in the long-term.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Background to Natural Hazards Assessment </h>
\par Natural hazards are better studied in the field of Environmental Sciences. <#/>Disciplines in this field include meteorology, geophysics/geology, hydrology, geography and agriculture. <#/>These discipl
ines provide a direct link in the analysis of temporal and spatial location and magnitude of disasters and form the basis for disaster early warning, preparedness and mitigation}{\v\fs24\lang2057  (Figure 1)}{\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>In Tanzania, a meteorologist, for instance, is capable of weather forecasting for both short and long term periods given over 2000 rain gauge stations, one international forecasting station and several local ones <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
(Temu meteorologist, Pers. Comm.)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>. <#/>He is also capable of providing data on storms, hurricanes
 and drought. <#/>The information on storms is essential in predicting the <-/occurance> of landslides in soil erosion prone areas which is the domain of a geographer. <#/>The same information may be used by a hydrologist to predict stream behaviour which
 is a precursor to floods in floodplains, and an indicator of drought in the catchment area.
\par <#/>A geophysicist is able to locate and assess the <-/occurance> in time and space and magnitude of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions by using a network of seismographs, a feature not available in Tanzania <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
(Dr. Iranga, physicist pers. comm.)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>. <#/>Such information, however, may be relevant to a geographer who may use it to foretell areas likely to be blanketed by lava and ash. <#/>The same information may be
 used to predict the falling of acid rain which may lead to environmental degradation by `killing' the life-support systems.
\par <#/>An agriculturalist is able to predict areas suitable for vermin breeding especially <ea_>quelea quelea<ea/> and red locusts bas
ing his interpretation, in part, on the changing weather patterns as predicted by a meteorologist. <#/>Furthermore, on the basis of the land use type in a given area, he is able to predict environmental degradation resulting from land mismanagement which 
enhances the likelihood of drought hazard.
\par <#/>From the theoretical plain, it is clear that if an efficient communication network is developed amongst these specialists at all levels of administration in Tanzania, natural disasters may no longer take the pe
ople and the state unawares. <#/>It is important to note that a reliable risk assessment of a potentially disastrous hazard is a prerequisite for a sound disaster mitigation programme and proper organisation of relief operations. <#/>Given that different 
communities behave differently in response to hazards there is need to engage social scientists, preferably an economist and a sociologist or anthropologist in the above exercise.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 An Environmental Disaster Relief Coordination Network Model </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 In designing an environmental disaster relief coordination network for Tanzania a number of assumptions are made. <#/>They are:
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 (i)\tab Existence of a good organisational structure of government from national to local level to facilitate coordination and accountability.
\par <#/>(ii)\tab Existence of a potential for a 'bottom up' approach in development planning through the re-established local government and cooperative unions planning machineries. <#/>This would facilitate the introduction of environment protectio
n in the plans.
\par <#/>(iii)\tab Availability of a pool of a potentially resourceful manpower at all levels of the state administration capable of serving as focal points.
\par <#/>(iv)\tab Availability of national and international institutions capable of carrying out disaster early warning, <-/survaillance> and monitoring and mitigation activities.
\par <#/>(v)\tab Existence of a potentially good system of education from primary through secondary education and folk development and teachers' colleges to University level to facilit
ate training of disaster management staff when environmental education is introduced in the system.
\par <#/>It is proposed that the environmental disaster relief coordination network should constitute four stages namely village, district, regional and national levels <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Figure 2)}{\fs24\lang2057 
</X>. <#/>At each stage three operations namely disaster identification, assessment of elements at risk and taking appropriate action should be conducted. <#/>Based on a suitable early warning system, the network should be supported b
y the willingness to report as well as an appropriate communication method. <#/>Essentially between one stage and the next there should be a two-way communication system to ensure that the message is received and reply is sent in `good' time for action.<X
_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Figure 2)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Village Level: </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 In Tanzania, village leadership is built on democracy and self-determination within the limits of law of the land. <#/>The villages and <ea/>Ujamaa Villages Act of 1975 was designed to entrench and consolida
te village self-government in the law. <#/>It is against this background that we propose the village as a nucleus for setting up a disaster relief coordination network for the nation.
\par <#/>At village level, it is proposed that a small committee be created a
nd charged to deal with natural hazard(s) characteristic of the area. <#/>This committee should preferably be composed of the village chairman, as the chairperson, a primary school teacher, as the focal point and secretary to the committee and three membe
r
s, one of them a woman. <#/>It is recommended that a school teacher, given his comparative academic competence in this environment, is capable of reporting fairly accurately on the hazard to higher authorities and vice-versa for action. <#/>Given the uniq
ue role played by women at household level, it is recommended that a woman be included in the committee to cater for women and children aspirations in the event of emergency.
\par <#/>The focal point would be responsible for collection of data on disaster early 
warning, working with other village committee members in developing an action plan and promptly reporting to the district authority on the proceedings of the meeting whilst implementing mitigation measures designed. <#/>The communication method should be 
by dispatching a militia-man to carry the message to the District Headquarters by hand.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 District Level </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 At the district level, participatory democracy in Tanzania was set in motion by the 1971 decentralization policy. <#/>Following from this move, medium and high level skilled manpower were posted in the districts.
\par <#/>In view of the availability of experts, it is proposed at this stage that a small committee to handle natural hazards be constituted. <#/>The committee would consist of the Dis
trict commissioner as the chairman, the District Administrative Officer as the focal point and Secretary, the District Executive Director, the District Water Engineer, the District Agricultural Development Officer, District Land Development Officer, the D
istrict Medical Officer and one representative from the Women Organisation }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>The primary tasks of the committee would be firstly to forecast natural hazards and secondly to carry out mitigation measures.
\par <#/>In the proposed network, however, 
this committee is also charged with the evaluation of the village committee report, technically assess the vulnerability land resilience and assess the rehabilitation cost. <#/>As a technical committee closest to the people it should maintain a sound syst
em of early warning, <-/survaillance> and maintain of natural hazards problems }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>The committee is also expected to report immediately to the regional authority on the proceedings while at the same time taking mitigation measures. <#/>Due to t
he need for a forward and backward linkage in the network the committee should communicate with the village committee by dispatching a policeman and at the same time communicate with the regional committee by using a radio call, telephone or telex.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Regional Level </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The organisational <-/set up> at the regional level would essentially be similar to that at district level. <#/>Member to the committee would as well be limited to technical ability and political power.
\par <#/>The Regional Administrat
ive Officer would serve as the focal point and secretary while the Regional Commissioner would be the chairman. <#/>Other members of the committee would include the Regional Development Director, Regional Water Engineer, Regional Agricultural Development 
Officer, Regional Land Development Officer, Regional Medical Officer and a representative from the Women Organisation.
\par <#/>The committee would basically be responsible for providing a regional coverage on the early warning system, <-/survaillance> and monit
oring of disasters. <#/>Further it would be charged with the evaluation of the district plan of action technically assess the vulnerability and resilience, cost the needs and finally carry out mitigation measures and relief administration <X_>}{
\v\fs24\lang2057 (Figure 2)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X
>. <#/>The committee would promptly submit its plan of action to the district committee and to the Central Government for further action. <#/>The communication method would be by radio-call, telex, telephone or where appropriate by a local radio station.

\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 National Level </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 It is proposed that at national level the office of the Prime Minister and First Vice-President handle disasters problems.
\par <#/>The committee would constitute the Head of the Disaster Unit who would save as the focal point and
 secretary, a Principal Secretary would be the chairman and one expert from each of the following institutions would serve as members: Directorate of Meteorology, Ministry of Water, Ministry of Energy and Minerals, Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock De
v
elopment, Ministry of Lands, Natural Resources and Tourism, University of Dar es Salaam, Sokoine University of Agriculture, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Home Affairs and representatives from relevant Non-Governmental Organisations and United Nations O
rganisations.
\par <#/>Although the nature of the tasks for this committee is similar to the lower one, the difference is one of degree. <#/>This committee should be capable of maintaining functioning systems of early warning, <-/survaillance>, monitoring and mi
tigation of disasters at national level. <#/>In the event of the crisis, the committee should be responsible for evaluating the regional plan of action and carrying out mitigation measures and relief administration }{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Figure 2)}{
\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>This event will close the
 functioning of the network but not the struggle against nature. <#/>As new experiences are gained during the battle for survival, better methods to combat disaster problems will be discovered <-_land><+_and> tested.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Education as a Corner-stone for the Functioning of the Network </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The need for environmental education from village to national level cannot be over-emphasized. <#/>The primary objective should be to define the role each member of the society (at all levels) is likely to assume in
 the event of a disaster.
\par <#/>At village level mass education would be through community participation i.e. learning by <-/seing> and doing. <#/>Hence the issue of the people's awareness to disasters may be approached by use of word of mouth coupled with a
ction. <#/>The early warning system at this level would be people's behaviour in response to the hazard based on socio-economic indicators <X_>(}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Curry 1984)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>.}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{<X}{\v _><#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 As for the members of the village committee, the subject of natural hazards could be of
fered in folk development colleges, primary and secondary schools as well as teachers' colleges. <#/>These institutions could cater for both pre and post-school training.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 It is worth noting that from the district level upwards the personnel is drawn fr
om technical colleges and University. <#/>For this group, environment education could be introduced in more detail in colleges and University curricula to meet the national training needs and priorities. <#/>The early warning systems employed at these lev
els include <-/mannual> and automated equipment and machines.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 As for the serving bureaucrat, a sensitization programme on natural hazards geared to enlightening them on the impact of environmental hazards on the population and the economy should be laun
ched. <#/>This would take the form of seminars and training workshops.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 At all levels, however, it is recommended that guided visits to the affected areas would sensitize the community on the importance of natural disasters early warning systems in disa
ster preparedness and prevention. <#/>It is worth noting that the importance of adult education at al levels cannot be over-emphasized.
\par <h> }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Conclusion</h>
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 By way of conclusion, it may be stated that the proposed network, badly requires Government m
aterial and financial support as well as the political will in order to enable Tanzania <+_to> <-/excell> in natural disaster early warning, preparedness and mitigation. <#/>Finally, there is need to create a national policy on natural disaster problems i
n order to facilitate an efficient functioning of the network. <#/>Such a policy would, among other things, set national standards for natural disasters based on the uniqueness of each hazard and its spatial location in a socio-economic context. }{

\par <I> <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 INTRODUCTION </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The pricing of merchandise is a most difficult task for the retailer because many variables influence the decision. <#/>In an investigation of department store pricing, Dalrymple and Thompson (1969) observed that the use of mark\_
up pricing results in a number of activities that go beyond the simple calculation of retai
l prices. <#/>An elaboration on the above statement has clearly been <-/broughtout> by Bolen (1982) who mentions the judgement of appeal of goods by target markets, competition, characteristics of merchandise, merchandise cost, the role of price in retail
 mix and legal consideration as among the many variables that influence retailers' mark\_ups. <#/>Given these variables, one does not expect a uniform percentage of mark\_
up among products carried by retailers. <#/>Furthermore, one does not expect a uniform percentage of mark\_up among the various categories of retailers.
\par <#/>The few empirical investigations that have been conducted in different parts of the }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>orth}{\fs24\lang2057  World have come up with mixed results regarding the influence of some of the above mentioned variables on retail mark\_
ups. <#/>These studies are certainly an indication of the fact that there is need to identify concrete causes for mark\_up dispersion among product groups/items and retail categories.
\par <#/>Mark\_ups have been shown to vary considerably among different products and categories of retail businesses and organisations. <#/>Mark\_ups have also been shown to vary between cities and locations.
\par <#/>In the case of US Department Stores in 1962 "some common mark\_ups of 20 percent for books, 41 percent for dresses, 46 percent for custom <AmE/>jewelry, and 50 percent for millinery" were observed <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Kotler 1971: 340)}{
\fs24\lang2057 </X>. <#/>Kotler further observed that in US retail grocery industry, items like coffee, canned milk and sugar tend to have low average mark\_ups, while items like frozen foods, jellies and some canned products have high average mark\_
ups. <#/>For example, Preston (1963: 31) showed that within the category of frozen foods, <-/markups> range from a low of 15 percent to a high of 213 percent. <#
/>Dalrymple and Thompson (1969: 182) observed that frequently purchased items like coffee and [vegetable] shortening carry low mark\_ups of between 5 and 1O percent. <#/>They further observe that such fast\_
moving items are actually sometimes sold below cost.
\par <#/>On the other hand, Holdren (1960) found that baby food, flour, sugar, coffee, cornmeal and vegetable shortening were sold at a loss by one or more of eight stores he studied in the United States of America, a conclusion consistent with Dalrymple and 
Thompson's study which observed generally low mark\_ups for grocery products in supermarkets <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Dalrymple and Thompson 1969: 183)}{\fs24\lang2057 
</X>. <#/>Holdren observed further that less important items such as spices and cleansers usually carry higher mark\_ups of between 30 and 50 percent.
\par <#/>Mark\_up differentials have been found also among various categories of retailers between shop types and between cities. <#/>Holdren (1960), for example, found a difference of about 10 percent between the lowest priced chain and 
the highest-priced independent supermarkets in a Midwestern community USA, a finding that has been frequently quoted in marketing. <#/>The average differential among the eight stores that he studied was about 2 percent <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
(Dalrymple and Thompson 1969: 181)}{\fs24\lang2057 
</X>. <#/>In Preston's study (1963) a maximum of 12 percent separating indices of advertised prices for eleven supermarkets in Northern California Community were observed. <#/>In another study of 25 food stores, Preston (1966: 27) found a 10 percent diffe
rence between the highest and lowest priced stores, with an average price differential of 3 percent.
\par <#/>While the above mark\_up differentials have been observed in the United States of America similar observations have been done elsewhere. <#/>Trade and I
ndustry records of the United Kingdom (1976), showed that grocers and provision dealers have lower margins (19.9 percent) than confectioners, tobacconists, newsagents (20.4 percent), clothing and footwear shops (36.4 percent), and household goods shops (3
8.8 percent) <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Tucker, 1978: 22)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>. <#/>In the Netherlands, Noteboom (1985) observed mark\_ups of between 26 and 35 percent for textile items while for the same items, Bode }{\i\fs24\lang2057 et al }{
\fs24\lang2057 (1986) observed mark\_ups of between 23 and 49 percent. <#/>In the same studies, Noteboom observed mark\_ups of 19 percent for supermarkets while Bode }{\i\fs24\lang2057 et al }{\fs24\lang2057 observed mark\_
ups of between 15 and 25 percent for the same kind of retail organisation.
\par <#/>Mark\_up differentials appear to exist not only in industrialized countries but also in developing countries. <#/>For instance, in Tanzania supermarket mark\_
ups for sugar and soap products were shown to vary between 6 and 8 percent, 15 and 18 percent for canned foods and 25 to 30 percent for fresh meats and produce (ESAMI, 1986). <#/>In Moshi Urban district retail outlets, mark\_
ups were observed to range between 10 and 15 percent <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Lema, 1987)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>.
\par <#/>\tab Mwaipopo (1988) observed mark\_up dispersions of between 10 and 33 percent for laundry soap, 20 to 61 percent for textiles and 21 to 56
 percent for footwear in Mbeya Urban retail outlets. <#/>A computation of percentage margins from the National Price Commission price list of 1986 indicated retail <-/markups> of 13.3 percent for food and beverages, 15 percent for textile and clothing, 13

\par <#/>Many hypotheses have been advanced to explain the variation of the mark\_ups within selected product groups, and categories of retail business or retail organisations. <#/>Three commonly used rules of thumb are that (a) mark\_
ups should vary inversely with unit cost (b) mark\_ups should vary inversely with turnover and (c) mark\_ups should be higher and prices lower on retailers' private brands than on manufacturers' brands <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Kotler, 1971: 341)}{
\fs24\lang2057 </X>.
\par <#/>Several studies have empirically tested some of these rules and other variables that may help explain dispersions in retail mark\_ups. <#/>As noted earlier, these studie
s have failed to come up with a common conclusion. <#/>The number of independent variables investigated have differed from one researcher to another and often the number and variety of chosen independent variables have been determined by data availability
. <#/>Several authors have also noted with concern the general lack of data in retailing <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Tucker, 1975 and Noteboom, 1985)}{\fs24\lang2057 
</X>. <#/>The result is that many studies have employed intuitive reasoning guided by the data patterns to arrive at their conclusions. <#/>Little formal testing of the suggested relationships has been undertaken.
\par <#/>Nevertheless, there are several empirical studies that deserve mention. <#/>Jefferys (1938) and Ward (1973) examined the influence of the rate of stock\_turn on wholesale
 and retail gross margins, respectively. <#/>On the other hand, Holdren (1960) investigated the relationship between price and size of organisation. <#/>Preston (1963) formally tested the impact of the three commonly used rules of thumb on mark\_
up dispersion. <#/>Dalrymple and Thompson (1969) studied the correlation between mark\_
ups and retail prices. <#/>Also, the UK's National Board for Prices and Incomes (1969) investigated the influence of fifteen variables on margins of selected product groups. <#/>Ano
ther study by Reefs and Young (1975) attempted to determine the relationship between retail prices and wholesale price.
\par <#/>Bowbrick (1975, 1976) has examined the impact of price control on market margins of fresh produce. <#/>More recently investigations on mark\_up variations have been undertaken by Noteboom (1980, 1982, 1985), and Bode }{\i\fs24\lang2057 et al}{
\fs24\lang2057  (1986).
\par <#/>Given the differing results and conclusions regarding factors influencing mark\_up variations as provided in the literature, this study found it worthwhile to empirically examine mark\_
up variations among selected products in Tanzania's retail businesses. <#/>The researcher was interested in percentage gross margins of individual product groups sold by retailers in the Dar es Salaam region.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 1.1.  RESEARCH OBJECTIVES </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The primary objective of this study was to study the mark\_up variations among selected retailers' product groups in general and to investigate the variables that affect such variation.
\par <#/>To this end, the specific objectives of the study were first to determine and assess the influence of merchandise cost on mark\_ups.
\par <#/>The second objective was to examine the influence of merchandise turnover on mark\_ups. <#/>Of great importance to the pricing policy of a retail outlet is the eff
ect that lower prices will have on sales. <#/>In a competitive environment, as selling prices decline, sales rise <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Pintel and Diamond, 1983: 245)}{\fs24\lang2057 
</X>. <#/>However, some merchandise is slower moving than others, that is to say, stock turns over fewer times per year. <#/>A store or product with a quick turnover can afford a small mark\_up and lower prices because it will receive that mark\_
up many times during the period. <#/>This is perhaps another reason for the variation of pricing or markup policies among various categories of merchandise.
\par <#/>The third objective of the study sought to determine the influence of population on mark\_ups. <#/>Population is a potential demand determinant and hence its anticipated effect on mark\_ups.
\par <#/>The fourth objective was to investigate the influence of distance (location) on mark\_ups. <#/>Distance, say from the location of the store to the }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>orth}{\fs24\lang2057  City centre may influence variation in mark\_
ups, given presumably different carrying costs.
\par <#/>The final objective was to examine and compare margin variations between product categories and product types.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 1.2. RATIONALE FOR SETTING THE OBJECTIVES </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 This study was motivated by the gross absence of comprehensive empirical studies to justify or explain the variation of mark\_ups or product margins, hence selling prices by retailers in Tanzania. <#/>Specifically, this study \tab 
is justified by the fact that there is no other empirical study that has studied the mark\_up disparities in Dar es Salaam.
\par <#/>Elsewhere, ther
e have been differing results and conclusions from empirical studies reported in the literature. <#/>Some have been narrow in scope and yet others have been methodologically deficient. <#/>Certainly this may partly be responsible for the mixed results and
 conclusions. <#/>Further, some have differed in terms of scope and context. <#/>Scopewise, some researchers have investigated and predicted the influence of a single item on mark\_
up variation. <#/>Lack of consideration of the other factors has clearly been
 brought out by Tucker (1978: 32) who argues that "... given that so little of the variation in gross margins is explained by this simple relationship it can be argued that many others should be taken into account...\rdblquote 
\par <#/>As far as methods of analysis are 
concerned, different researchers have used different analytical techniques. <#/>Some have used correlation analysis in which case "causality" is not taken into consideration. <#/>Yet others have used simple regression analysis, and the result is that many
 
other factors have been excluded. <#/>Tucker (1978) has already criticized this approach. <#/>Corr (1974) has also argued that merchandise cost alone cannot determine mark-ups. <#/>Preston (1963) has concluded that the three commonly used rules of thumb, 
a
lone, cannot also explain mark-up dispersions. <#/>Further, Kotler (1971) has argued that mark-up variation among retailers and among product groups are sometimes the result of erratic decisions, random factors and better adaptation to the current market 
than can be provided for by the rules of thumb.
\par <#/>Contextwise, some studies have concentrated on investigating mark-up dispersions among retail types, retail organisation and between cities, and yet others have investigated mark-up variation among product groups.
\par <#/>The current study overcomes the shortcomings of previous studies by considering mark-up variation among product groups. <#/>The consideration of mark-up differences among various retail organisations in Tanzania may not be meaningful, because 
the retail business is still not modernized. <#/>In Tanzania retail business has been and still is dominated by the small retailer. <#/>There are, therefore, only a handful of supermarkets even in Dar es Salaam, the commercial heart of the country. <#/>In
v
estigating mark-up variation among types of retailer may also not bring out meaningful results because the classification on the basis of whether one is a general or <AmE/>specialty (exclusive) retailer is not very distinctive. <#/>For instance, textile s
tores will generally be selling a lot of other items like food and miscellaneous articles.
\par <#/>Further, a study on mark-up variation along the above lines will entail the collection of data on operating expenses which is hard to collect in a country where r
etail business is dominated by the small and individual retailer. <#/>These individual retailers rarely keep formal records.
\par <#/>A more practical approach of studying mark-up variation in Tanzania could be based on classification of retail outlets by owner
ship. <#/>However, a similar problem to the one observed above is encountered because the individual small owner dominates. <#/>Attempts to introduce the socialization of trade since independence (1961) saw the emergence of consumer cooperative retail out
lets.
\par <#/>Nevertheless, currently cooperative shops represent a very small number of retail outlets when compared with the total retail outlets.</I>

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 2.1 DEFINITION OF DEVELOPMENT BANKS </h>
\par \tab }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The term "development banks" or "development financial institutions" is used to describe those types of financial institutions which promote and 
assist industrial, agricultural, mining and other sectors of the economy. <#/>While there are a number of financial institutions providing medium and long\_
term credit for investments (such as commercial banks), these are different from development banks in
 that development banks promote and finance investment within the framework of a set of priorities and strategies derived from the national development plans. <#/>The development plans usually provide a set of broad objectives and an outline of a strategy
 which need to be translated into specific individual projects.
\par <#/>\tab Many writers on development banking have used the term "development bank" synonymously with development "finance company/institution". <#/>These writers have also tried to give various def
initions of the term development bank. <#/>Diamond gives a functional definition of the term which more or less follows the World Bank's definition. <#/>According to him, a development bank is: <quote_>
\par }{\i\fs24\lang2057 <X_>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 ".... a bank whose function is to provide medium and long\_term capital to productive enterprises in developing economies}{\v\fs24\lang2057 ."}{\fs24\lang2057 </X><quote/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 This definition emphasises more on the financial aspect of the development banks and neglects the developmental aspect. <#/>In Africa these banks also offer technical
 and managerial consulting services at all stages of a project. <#/>Some of them have developed training programmes to produce local experts. <#/>Kane notes that development banks function as financial intermediaries in transferring domestic and foreign s
avings to investment and thus contribute to economic development. <#/>In addition to this financing function, they have other intangible effects upon economic development. <#/>These are:
\par i) development of a capital market by mobilising funds from both local and foreign sources; and
\par ii) through their relation with their clients, they have been able to help in the development of technology, promotion of viable projects, and practices and quality of management.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 2.2 ORIGINS OF DEVELOPMENT BANKS </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
Development banks began to be set up after the First World War to cope with special problems stemming from depression, wartime destruction, regional imbalances, and so forth. <#/>After World War II there was an increase in industrial reconstruction and so
 
the acceleration of setting up of development banks. <#/>Such banks are at present very much involved in restructuring industrial activities. <#/>Examples are the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation in the United Kingdom, and the <foreign><-/Kre
ditaustalt> <-/fur> <-/Wiederaufban><foreign/> in Germany. <#/>These assist their respective governments by reallocating resources from labour intensive industries.
\par <#/>In most developing countries, development banks have evolved as a result of new needs created by the development of }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  financial sector.
\par }\pard\plain \s17\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 <#/>The second\_quarter of the 19th century saw governments establishing specialised financial institutions to promote economic growth. <#/>These states saw the only means to economic progress was th
rough industrialisation. <#/>Industrialisation would mean achievement of national income growth. <#/>Further, these countries would not be forced to trade in raw materials on terms set out by the industrialised countries just because they (developing coun
tries) could not use them. <#/>And these banks would contribute to economic development by providing technical and managerial services and the mobilisation of resources. <#/>The first development bank in Africa was established in 1951 by the
\par \pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang1031 {\fs24\lang2057 national govern
ment with international financing assistance. <#/>In the former British colonies (i.e. Kenya, Uganda) development banks were established on the initiative of the colonial government. <#/>}{\fs24\ul\lang2057 The Uganda Development Corporation}{
\fs24\lang2057  (UDC) was established in 1952 and 
was the oldest. <#/>The colonial government was prompted to establish it because of the Korean boom which led to demand for and prices of Uganda's main crops (cotton and coffee) to soar. <#/>With the attainment of independence, the UDC was already a power
f
ul institution and subsequently became the new government's sole instrument for the development of virtually all sectors of the economy. <#/>When the Development Finance Company of Uganda was formed in 1963, the UDC became a partner in this Company on beh
alf of the Ugandan Government.
\par <#/>\tab Earlier in August 1972, the Government of the then President Iddi Amin Dada pronounced the decision of transferring the economy to Ugandans from the Asians. <#/>The implementation of this decision dislodged the old establ
ishment and brought in new entrepreneurs and businessmen who lacked business experience and were not known to the commercial banks. <#/>As a way of assisting these businessmen both in financing and provision of technical and managerial skills, the Ugandan
 Government formed the Uganda Development Bank.
\par <#/>\tab In Kenya, }{\fs24\ul\lang2057 The Industrial Development Corporation (IDC)}{\fs24\lang2057  was formed in 1954 to make capital available to existing small businesses and those seeking to enter the retail trade. <#/>The colonial segregation o
f the economy had isolated African businessmen from the system of banking and commercial credit. <#/>The banks had always regarded assistance to the African economy as a government concern, seeing their own function rather as facilitating international mo
v
ement of capital. <#/>Thus, in the years before independence the only sources of credit open to African businessmen were small government loans administered through local boards. <#/>The IDC could not continue operations by 1966 because of lack of funds. 
<
#/>It could not contribute the size of capital needed for the increasingly ambitious commercial and industrial activities of the local governing aspirant bourgeoisie. <#/>The requirements of the petty traders were also not met. <#/>The aspirant bourgeoisi
e
 were finding alternative sources of capital through partnership or association with corporate institutions, governments and individuals from abroad. <#/>Tensions grew and demands for greater benefits of private enterprise for the Africans was raised. <#/
>
Thus, the 1967 Industrial Development Act, Cap.517 was amended to establish the Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation (ICDC). <#/>Other measures aimed at ensuring African participation and control in the economy were also instituted. <#/>Such 
were the Trade and Licensing Act, No. 33 of 1967 which empowered the Ministry of Commerce and Industry through licensing to control non\_
citizen trading in geographical areas as well as in specified commodities. <#/>The Immigration Act, No. 25 of 1967, gave government control over the long\_term residence of non\_
citizens in the country. <#/>The Personnel Bureau set up in 1967 monitored employment opportunities in the private sector with special reference to the employment of Africans.
\par <#/>The ICDC's statement of activities include: <quote_>
\par <X_>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 ".... help to African industrialists and traders to expand their operations, the construction of shopping centres and industrial estates and the promotion of overall Africanisation of industry and commerce."}{\fs24\lang2057 
 </X><quote/>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Later in 1970/71 this function was reiterated as follows: <quote_>
\par <X_>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 "....Besides this tremendous success in the Corporation's development role, the ICDC <-/relentensly>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  <-/}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 persued> its promotional role as an effective mechanism for the implementati

\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Other development banks were also established in Kenya such as the Industrial Development Bank Ltd., the Development Finance Compa
ny of Kenya Ltd., the Kenya Tourist Development Corporation, and so forth. <#/>These parastatals are charged with the investment of governments' funds in the enterprises within the country.
\par <#/>\tab Apart from those few examples, the majority of the African De
velopment Banks were established after independence. <#/>Examples are the National Investment Bank (NIB) of Ghana which was established in March 1963 (six years after independence) by the government when it simultaneously launched its Seven Year National 
Development Plan 1963/64 \_ 1969/70. <#/>In Tanzania, the Tanzania Investment Bank was formed in 1970. <#/>In Chapter III of this study we shall discuss in detail the Tanzania Investment Bank.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 2.3 OWNERSHIP, LEGAL FORMS, OBJECTIVES, FUNCTIONS, etc. OF DEVELOPMENT BANKS </h>
\par \tab }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Development banks are among the basic institutions established by states to help achieve developmental objectives. <#/>They can be statutory bodies corporate set up through or under an Act of Parliament, or may be formed under
 the Companies Acts. <#/>However, they all have the primary responsibility for the development and co\_ordination of various sectors of the economy and are directly accountable to the government and Parliament.
\par <#/>\tab Important questions in this area relate to the form of organisation, field of activities, degree of autonomy enjoyed by the development banks, and their relationship with other public bodies.
\par <#/>\tab Notably here is the fact that the specific form of organisation of these banks in the developing cou
ntries was determined by political and legal frameworks as well as by structures of business organisations. <#/>While in some countries these banks were established in the public sector as public corporations, in others both public and private development
 
financial institutions exist. <#/>However, the distinction between public or private forms of organisation is really not significant so long as governments ensured that both conducted their business within the framework of planned priorities and objective
s
. <#/>And, apart from the colonial past of a country, the size and stage of development with the corresponding availability of skills will also influence the form of institution preferred. <#/>A number of development banks have been established as recipie
nts of international aid which they are required to channel to development projects.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 2.3.1 Ownership and Legal Forms </h>
\par \tab }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 One way that has been used to classify these banks is by the type of ownership. <#/>It should be pointed out that there can be no such thing as the standard mode, ready\_
made, all purpose development bank which can be utilised effectively in every country. <#/>Thus, the form must be tailored to suit each situation. <#/>Some of the types of development banks are as follows:
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 i) Private Development Banks:
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 All the capital stock is owned within the private sector and their operating policy is under private sector control. <#/>Such banks are largely profit\_oriented, seeking only projects with high marginal monetary returns as
 opposed to those which maximise development impact. <#/>Source of finance is generally from the private sector. <#/>This type of bank is established under the companies ordinance.
\par <#/>ii) Public Development Banks:
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 All of the capital stock of this kind
 of bank is owned within the public sector and its operating policy is under public sector control. <#/>This type of bank is generally not only interested in profit, but places greater stress on development criteria. <#/>Although in the short\_
term there is a low marginal monetary return, it is expected this will be reversed in the long\_term. <#/>Its main source of funding is government allocations. <#/>This type of bank is established by an Act of Parliament.
\par <#/>iii) Mixed Development Banks:
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 In this ty
pe of bank, the capital stock is owned by both the public and private sector. <#/>Therefore, the bank may be under private or public ownership, depending on which sector owns the majority capital stock. <#/>Its sources of finance are both the public and p
rivate sectors.
\par <#/>It should be noted that one form of development banks outlined above, is not necessarily preferable to the other. <#/>All do make their own contribution to economic development. <#/>However, there tend to be special advantages to each ki
nd of bank. <#/>The private bank is able to attract privately\_
owned financial assets into the development process, which would likely otherwise end up in lower priority investments or perhaps not be invested in the domestic economy in any form. <#/>Also th
is type of bank is able to deal more effectively with the aspect of project promotion because of its greater profit orientation.
\par <#/>It has been argued, however, that the co\_existence of both private and public development banks is very ideal in speeding u
p economic development. <#/>For example, in a given priority industry some firms are likely to be more profitable and more likely to prosper and grow. <#/>While other firms are likely to be marginally profitable, but then they are essential in that they p
r
omote a more developmental role. <#/>In such a situation the private type of bank may finance the more profitable firms while the public type of bank may finance the less profitable firm. <#/>In this way, both complement one another in financing long-term
 development.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 2.3.2. Organisational Structure </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The organisational structure of any development bank is set out in the instrument establishing it. <#/>In most development banks in Africa, the organisation structures show a remarkable similari
ty in that all have as their governing body a Board of Directors. <#/>The Board of Directors, subject to directives of a general nature, are responsible for the management of the development banks. <#/>The }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>orth}{\fs24\lang2057 
 Minister of government has the power to give directions of general nature in respect of the basic policy principles.
\par <#/>Development banks which have been established under Company law have directors which are elected by the shareholders mostly on account of their professional and business compet
ence. <#/>The public/government owned development banks have directors who are either ministers and/or government officials. <#/>The members of the board in this case, are appointed by the government with the Chairman ordinarily being the Minister of Econ
omic Planning, Industry or Finance. <X_>}{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 However, most African development institutions lie somewhere in between these two extremes. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
For example even in a wholly owned government development bank (e.g. The Tanzania Investment Bank) some of their directors are selected for their professional, industrial and commercial competence and experience and are not government officials. }{

\par <I> <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL PLANNING IN TANZANIA </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
In Tanzania agriculture is the backbone of the economy. <#/>Nearly 85 per cent of Tanzanians depend on agriculture for their livelihood, and external trade is largely dependent on agricultural products, accounting for more than 50 per cent of exports, 
while most of Tanzania's industries are dependent on agriculture. <#/>Besides these, the potential for producing surplus food and for financing the country's industrial revolution lies in the hands of the agricultural sector. <#/>In a nutshell, agricultur
e is the cornerstone of socio-economic development, the source of food, income, foreign exchange earnings and the base for industrialization in Tanzania.
\par <#/>Agricultural development planning has itself a number of dimensions: macro level, meso level and mi
cro level such as national, regional and village plans respectively. <#/>In Tanzania national or macro plans cover 5 years. <#/>These are presented against a background of 15 years perspective plan. <#/>Secondly, there is sector planning which refers to d
etailed planning of a specific sector. <#/>Agricultural Planning thus refers to a comprehensive set of policies for the development of the agricultural sector. <#/>Also at the secondary level we have regional or }{\fs24\ul\lang2057 area planning}{
\fs24\lang2057  where the focus of attention is a particular region or area within a country. <#/>Finally, at the tertiary level of planning there are some projects which refers to the identification of possible projects for their implementation }{
\v\fs24\lang2057 (Fig. 1)}{\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>Hence, agricultural planning is a secondary
 level planning. <#/>It aims at transformation and improvement strategies. <#/>The improvement approach relies heavily on agricultural extension, the provision of technical and economic advise to <-_formers><+_farmers>, supplemented by efforts to improve 
the existing situation by removing specific bottlenecks, by construction of feeder road and improvements in marketing facilities on the provision of credit to farmers.
\par <#/>The transformation approach aims at a much more drastic reshaping of the conditions o
f agricultural production. <#/>This may involve the introduction of tractors, the extension of the public sector into agriculture through large scale state farming, the organization of major settlement schemes involving the movement of population, and the
 
establishment of cooperative farms of production, either among new settlements or within existing villages. <#/>The anxiety of governments and development agencies to make rapid progress away from underdevelopment has naturally inclined towards transforma
tion approach in most of the developing countries.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Conceptual Framework </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Fig. 2 illustrates that in Tanzania due to primitive agricultural practices, agricultural production is low but the population is increasing at a more rapid pace - which leads to food shortage, malnutrition and food importation.

\par <#/>Hence, the main objectives of the National Agricultural Planning have been to improve agricultural production for food self-sufficiency, and planned development of agricultural settlements. <
#/>These have been considered essential in order to provide essential services and infrastructural facilities to the majority of people living in remote rural areas.
\par <#/>Owing to these problems and objectives, the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock desi
gned various strategies and plans in order to solve the aforesaid problems and meet desired objectives. <#/>The government has formulated various policy guidelines and sought assistance of people in accordance with the targets set.
\par <#/>Improvement and tran
sformation approaches have been adopted. <#/>The improvement approach considered the improvement of material structure such as seeds, fertilizers, implements, etc. besides infrastructural improvement, whereas transformation approach included the formation
 of planned <ea/>Ujamaa Villages after discarding the primitive abode of dispersed living.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Importance of Agricultural Planning </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The need for agricultural planning is vital due to the fact that:
\par (a)\tab rural development (agriculture) has to receive top priority, as most of our latent wealth lies in our <-/under utilized> land and energies of the rural population.
\par <#/>(b)\tab agriculture being the backbone of our economy produces food for both rural and urban population. <#/>It also produces raw mater
ials for our industries and for export. <#/>Also the majority of our people (90 per cent) live in rural areas where agriculture is the chief occupation.
\par <#/>(c)\tab planned and desired social change will be achieved in the context of a programme of planned out
put expansion, based upon a system of crop priorities and improvement of productivity through promotion of modern agricultural techniques. <#/>With the above points, there is a need to plan for our agricultural development.
\par 
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Objectives of Agricultural Planning </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 According to Tanzanian development plans, the objectives of agricultural planning in relation to national planning are as follows:
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 1.\tab To diversify production in areas of monoculture - where markets are limited or uncertain.
\par <#/>2.\tab Investment programmes in the rural sector to be geared at capital intensity forms of production so as to maximize utilization of local resources such as labour force.
\par <#/>3.\tab To develop the rural infrastructure, so as to increase rural productivity and diversify rural economy.
\par <#/>4.\tab To extend principles of socialism and extend the scope of cooperative and group activities - for attainment of socialist type of agriculture.
\par <#/>5.\tab To formulate crop priorities for all major livestock and agricultural commodit
ies with the aim of increasing self-sufficiency and improved nutritional levels, expansion of local market for agricultural products at reasonable prices and maximum exploitation of export markets. <#/>High priority crops should be emphasized i.e. tea, fl
ue-cured tobacco, cotton, rice, wheat, cashew-nuts, oil seeds, some fruits, vegetable, fishing and livestock.
\par <#/>6.\tab Expansion of small scale industries and crafts to provide consumer goods - hence generating an incentive for agricultural expansion. <#/>For all these to be achieved, the involvement of village, district, and regional levels is urgently needed.

\par <#/>The agricultural objectives are related to the national objectives. <#/>The former have been derived from the latter. <#/>So they are more or less the <-_name><+_same>.
\par <#/>In order to achieve these objectives which have been set, in its development plans, the government has emphasized on several measures to be taken as follows:
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 1.\tab The first emphasis was on the need to use fertilizer both chemical, compost, and green manure so as to increase production.
\par <#/>2.\tab Another area was on seed production. <#/>Seed production farms and seed laboratories were to be established under the Ministry of Agricultural so as to produce better and high yielding seeds to be distributed to farmers
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 3.\tab Crop research units and crop experimental units were also emphasized so as to carry out research on agriculture.
\par <#/>4.\tab Extension services were among other things which were emphasized too. <#/>Advises were to be given to farmers on crop management and animal husbandry.
\par <#/>5.\tab Another area was that of agricultural mechanisation. <#/>This aimed at enhancing production by providing tractor hire services, training on the use of agricultural machineries at selected institutions.
\par <#/>In most of these plans the government simply puts it on papers and does not make a thorough follow up to ensure its implementation.
\par <#/><h> Trends and Approaches </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Agricultural planning first of all got a priority place in 1946 development 
plan. <#/>The 1951 plan aimed at improvement of agriculture in Tanganyika. <#/>The 1964 - 1969 First Five Year Plan aimed at increasing output by 6.7 per cent, while the Second Five Year Plan (1969 - 1974) aimed at boosting up crops with provision of rese
arch, extension services and training to the staff. <#/>The Third Five Year Plan (1976 - 1981) also aimed at self-sufficiency in food production. <#/>The 1982 - 1985 structural Adjustment Programme aimed at more production of each crops for export.
\par <#/>It h
as been identified that there are two methods by which agriculture should be planned. <#/>First is the improvement approach undertaken by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Cooperative through guidance and extension services provided to the farmers. <#
/>Second is the transformation approach by the Ministry of Land, Settlement and Water Development involving the resettlement of people on newly provided land with all the infrastructure that goes to make a modern farmer.
\par <#/>What was the real situation in 1
970's? <#/>The mass of our farmers lives on scattered small and uneconomic holdings along with primitive agricultural implements. <#/>In this situation, the country finds itself caught up in a vicious circle of poverty - little production, little surplus 
for investment, and low incomes to farmers.
\par <#/>Hence after 1969 our national agricultural planning took a transformation approach. <#/>The policy has been spelled out on paper in the original and later policy documents, and in the Second Five Year Plan. <#
/>First, it emphasized the social as well as technical transformation of peasant agriculture and not just its marginal improvement. <#/>The objective is the development of <ea/>Ujamaa villages through the country. <#/>The Second Plan especially eschewed a
 
'project' approach and opted for a frontal approach moving towards <ea/>Ujamaa on all possible <-_front><+_fronts> rather than selective approach of providing a high level of service to small number of <ea/>Ujamaa communities. <#/>The socialist villages m
ust grow from an application of the principles of self-reliance through the efforts of their own member.
\par <#/>In this way, the sole aim of the national agricultural policy is to facilitate the path to socialism to which Tanzania is committed, and the State s
hould take the initiative to establish large scale modern State Farms, combining the production element of research and demonstration to farmers in the surrounding area. <#/>Agricultural development in rural areas through smallholders in cooperative produ
ction units (Ujamaa Villages) for selected crop priorities is regarded as critical in making development truly national and democratic.
\par <#/>Thus revolution of agriculture in the villages means socialist and modern agriculture which has the following attributes.. }{\fs24\ul\lang2057 
<#/>First, big socialist farms which are owned and run by villages: second, it is based on the use of modern inputs, implements, expertise and skills: }{\fs24\lang2057 and }{\fs24\ul\lang2057 third, it is a planned agriculture based on }{\fs24\lang2057 
proper work plans which facilitate greater productivity.
\par <#/>The main objectives of the Five Year Plans have been to boost up agricultural production of various crops with provision of research, extension services and training, better quality seeds, construction of irrigation schemes and storage facilities.

\par <#/>It has been realised that resources available for agricultural development are scarce, efficient utilization is therefore of great importance. <#/>The nature of resources to be mobilized is also extremely diverse. <#/>The efforts of farmers should be
 gained towards the extension services, research, credit facilities, investment programmes of the Parastatal and Public sectors both directly in agriculture and also in infrastructure.

te sector, the Germans constructed two railways: Dar es Salaam to Kigoma and Tanga to Moshi. <#/>Food crop production was left to the individual's initiative. <#/>Cooperatives for coffee, cotton and tobacco were established between 1930 - 1940's.

\par <#/>3.\tab In the field of crop production rice and cotton were helped by the construction of small dams for irrigation in the lake area where rainfall is deficient. <#/>For cotton, Ilonga and Ukiriguru Research St
ations provided cotton breeding services as well as assistance in cotton pest control and eradication. <#/>Coffee was helped by the Bukoba investigation centre, groundnut farms at Nachingwea, flue-cured tobacco at Urambo, and cattle including pasture impr
ovement at Kongwa.
\par <#/>4.\tab In 1951 plan special attention on improvement of agriculture and veterinary practice was given in four areas namely Sukumaland, Ulanga district, Mbulu district and parts of Morogoro district, besides training programmes of agricult

fish people's health will improve, and if we produce more sisal, cotton, coffee, and so on we can get more money from overseas with which to buy the other goods we want". <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057

\par <#/>The author intends to discuss these problems by relating his experience with the following assignments executed in Tanzania in the past few years. <#/>These include:

\par 
\par <h>}{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 2. What is Management Consulting?</h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Management consulting can be defined as a process of de
aling or solving management problems that confront business organizations using appropriately - trained, qualified and experienced professionals. <#/>In this process there are two key agents: the clients and the consultants. <#/>The clients are the manage
rs of such business organisations who seek services in terms of defining and working on a problem, analyses and solution search. <#/>Those who give the service in terms of technical advice, conducting indepth studies, etc. are known as consultants <X_>}{
\v\fs24\lang2057 (For a discussion see Kubr, 1980:368, <-/Lipitt> and <-/Lippitt>, 1978:130)}{\fs24\lang2057 
</X>. <#/>From above it can therefore be generalized that there is a relationship between a client and a consultant. <#/>This relationship is a helping process to achieve certain specific tasks and objectives. <#/>This relationship can be described as:

\par 
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 (i) Voluntary - when a client perceives a consultant as <-/truthfull>.
\par <#/>(ii) Temporary - with a defined starting and terminating period on a task.
\par <#/>(iii) Supportive - consulting is on the support side.
\par <#/>(iv) Disciplined - work based on certain standards.
\par 
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The interpretation of the helping relationship is controversial. <#/>One school of thought advocates that consultants are hired to study the problem and tell a client what is to be done}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 <X_>}{
\v\fs24\lang2057 (For a discussion see IBRD 1983:13; Barcus and Wilkison, 1986:439)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>. <#/>This is the expert - syndrome approach, where a consultant is the central focus and the role of a consultant is supervisory.
\par <#/>The other school of thought argu
es that a consultant can achieve the same results by pinning down his/her directive role. <#/>The helping process takes place through a collaborative effort with a client. <#/>It involves in identifying a problem and finding out alternative solutions to i
m
prove the situation. <#/>In this alternative approach, a client understanding of an organization problem is the focus. <#/>The role of a consultant is merely a catalyst, a counselling and a training role. <#/>In this context, a consultant's focus on a pro
blem is related to particular clients needs, leadership responsibilities and practice.
\par <#/>Whichever role one is pursuing there are certain problems which are intrinsic in consulting work that one can expect to experience. <#/>These problems are basically of two types:
\par - Consultant-centred problems, and
\par - Client-centred problems.
\par 
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\caps\fs24\lang2057 3. }{\fs24\lang2057 Consultant-<-/Centered> Problems </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 While Lippit and Lippit <-_define><+_defines> a consultant as: "a helper whose expertise has been contracted for by a client - system <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (<-/Lippit>, <-/Lipitt> 1978 p. 85)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>".
\par <#/>Block on the other hand define a consultant as: "a person in a position to have some influence over an individual, a group, or an organization, but has no direct power to make changes or implement program <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Block, 1978.p.1)}{
\fs24\lang2057 </X>".
\par <#/>From the above authorities, it can be concluded that a consultant may be an individual or a consulting firm approached to provide a service as engineers, planners, economists or financial analysts or any specialized ex
pertise in a particular area. <#/>The tasks or assignments for which consultants are employed can include dam design and construction feasibility studies, auditing accounts, institutional development assistance, project preparation and implementation stud
ies, etc.
\par <#/>From the <-_authors><+_author\rquote s> point of view, choosing a consultant or consulting firm much depends on the competence, experience and its ability to deliver total quality services. <#/>This also implies that a consultant is:
\par - Wanted, 
\par - Helpful, and 
\par - Informed and can be objective. <#/>Even with a lot of care being employed to appoint a competent                                                                                                          consultant, certain problems can surface 
up and need to be expected.
\par 
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 3.1 Tendency not to Listen </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 More often than not consultants would walk into an organization to "tell" a client what is wrong and what should be done to rectify the situation. <#/>This is specially the case, when consultants perceive themselves as "experts".

\par <#/>In this case a consultant makes the diagnosis and also develops a solution. <#/>The <-_clients><+_client\rquote s> role is to judge and evaluate the result. <#/>In engineering and accounting fields sometimes this
 approach is assumed, the argument being that the problems facing a client are of a purely technical nature.
\par <#/>In this process, consultants tend to neglect clients, tend not to be active listeners and do not internalize the motivations, biases and thoughts of a client.
\par <#/>For management consulting to be effective, it is proposed that a consultant should listen attentively, carefully, objectively and emphatically to a client. <#/>The role of a consultant vs a client is to gather information, seek clarific
ation, encourage a client to speak by actions and words and not to look for }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  <-_clients><+_client\rquote 
s> mannerism. <#/>The consultant should be encouraged to be free to consider and suggest options as to how to obtain the objectives.
\par 
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 3.2. \'94Know - It all" Attitude </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 This arises from a <-_consultants><consultant\rquote s> desire to demonstrate that one has all the answers to a <-_clients'><+_client\rquote 
s> problem. <#/>Anything a client proposes will probably be rejected by the "know - it all". <#/>Such a consultant always perceives things in the light of what he or she knows.
\par <#/>For example, in our USAID consultancy for SIPS there was a tendency for our American consultants to impose to our client that the Tanzanian public corporations are ineffi
cient and ineffective. <#/>For the American, what works must be organised within the framework of the private sector. <#/>It may be noted that in the case of Tanzania in the 1980's the enabling environment wouldn't have helped even the private sector to o
perate effectively and profitably.
\par <#/>Against the "know it all" it is suggested that the role of a consultant is to facilitate and help a client in the generation and arrive at alternative solutions. <#/>A client needs to have ownership of the solutions wh
ile a consultant assists to influence a change in clients' attitude.
\par 
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 3.3. Timing - Inappropriate </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Consultants tend to walk into clients' office }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  unannounced. <#/>There is a tendency to give short notices and/or to start a consul
ting engagement when a client is busy and has no time to collaborate in the work.
\par 
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 3.4 Differences In Perception </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Consultants walk into a client's <-_offices><+_office> with their individual and personal frames of references. <#/>These fram
es of reference consist of meanings they assign to people or situations based on their past experiences and often related to their interests. <#/>For example, in the consulting assignment with the Regional office in Tanga Region}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{
\fs24\lang2057 <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Shio, Mmbaga and Chailla, 1988)}{\fs24\lang2057 
</X> we <AmE/>favored the so called TRD (Training for Rural Development) system as opposed to Training and Visit system because of the consultants' special interest in the TRD system.
\par <#/>More often consultants <AmE/>favor a particular micro computer system because they are used to it and not because it is the best. <#/>This predisposition is a problem if a client's preference is different.
\par <#/>Against this approach it is advocated that consultants see things from clients' point of view }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  and to exercise restraint towards their personal interests.
\par 
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 3.5. Hostile Attitude </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Consultants sometimes exhibit hostility towards clients. <#/>We, consultants have the knowledge and expertise. <#/>Our attitudes towards clients is that th
ey do not know. <#/>In this process we close our ears, cease to listen regardless of what is said. <#/>There is a tendency to develop }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057 
 <AmE/>defense mechanism and a clients' point of views are put off. <#/>During the consultancy assignment in Tanga Region <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Shio, Mmbaga and Chailla, 1988)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X> 
there was a tendency to ignore views of local people in Pangani district as their Coastal ("Swahili") culture did not inspire the consulting team. <#/>Whatever information was collected, was merely used to justify that the team visited this district.

\par <#/>The most serious encounter the consulting team faced was with respect to Norad Import support study when the consulting team wanted to know what were "core" industries <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Skarstein. Havnevik and Mmbaga, 1988a)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>
. <#/>When the consulting teams' views did not match with that of a client, the response was ".... let us now reason like economists". <#/>The consulting team lost the cooperation of the client and some vital information.
\par <#/>It is being recommended that consultants try to approach a situation in a safe - controlled manner with an attitude of caring, encouraging, and supporting. <#/>A Consultant should be prepared to paraphrase, seek clarification and to explain issues.

\par 
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 3.6 Lack of follow-up Responsibilities </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Once consultants have helped a client, and their solutions adopted and implemented, consultants feel that they are through. <#/>After all, they have already been paid.
\par <#/>More of the consulting assignments belong to this trap. <#/>The SIPS consultancy with the USAID ended the moment a final report was submitted <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Morris, Honadle and Mmbaga, 1983)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>.
\par <#/>However, in the CIS engagement there was an attempt to make a follow-up, test some of the results and get the views shared with other people and test the usefulness of the findings over a large environment. <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057

\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 3.7 Lack of Empathy </h>

\par <h> 1.0 }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 INTRODUCTION </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Of late, there has grown a school of thought among students of International Economic Relations arguing that International Relations cannot be understood without knowing the pa
tterns of the flows of trade, Investments, and finance between states.
\par <#/>This paper is an attempt to analyse, by using examples, the validity and sustainability of the argument.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 2.0 TOWARDS A DEFINITION OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 To proceed with the analysis of the argument posed above, it is important to provide a working definition of International Relations.
\par <#/>International relations is a term and concept which refers to the sum total of interactions among international actors irresp
ective of whether these interactions are political, cultural, economic or scientific. <#/>It therefore embraces all that is categorized as International politics and more <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Potter 1980:2)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>.
\par <#/>From this shorthand definition, three things stand out clearly; 
First, that there exists what is described as the International system; Secondly, there exist actors within the International system; and thirdly, that these actors relate to one another in the system.
\par <#/>That is why one can legitimately classify the following as International relations:
\par (a) Economic transactions among actors,
\par (b) Tourism, migration, and cultural exchanges across states and national frontiers,
\par (c) The entire range of communications among actors such as mails, intelligence reports,
\par (d) Military relations among actors such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Australia New Zealand and United States (ANZUS), and the South East Asia Treat Organization (SEATO) etc.,
\par (e) Relations between International and supranational organizations such as those of the United Nations (UN), The Organization of American States (OAS) and the Arab League. etc.,
\par (f) Big and small business transactions across national frontiers.
\par <#/>From the above, there are at least four broad categories of International Relations:
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 2. l Private International Relations: </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 These are relations between citizens belonging to diverse nation states. <#/>These relationships are not in any way mediated by the various states except in so far as these states issue passports, visas, stamps or foreign exchange.

\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 2.2 Cultural International <-/Relationns>: </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 These are cultural, social and intellectual relations that link many states and actors. <#/>They may be sporting activities s
uch as the Olympic games, Commonwealth Games or the All Africa Games; or cultural festivals such as the World Black and African Festivals of Arts and Culture or the very many meetings of Intellectual association at world level.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 2.3 International Economic Relations: </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 These involve international trade, commerce, the transfer of capital and technology, commodity and payment arrangements, and of course, the entire critical problem of the relationship between the poor and the rich.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 2.4 \tab International Political Relations: </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 These are the areas covered by International politics. <#/>Sometimes, it is called Public International Relations. <#/>It encompasses, and military diplomatic affairs and both intelligence and counter intelligence.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 3.0 THE ROLE OF ECONOMIC FACTORS IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Having defined what international relations are, it is now important to move to the significance of political economy in international relations. <#/>Here, we need to note first
 and foremost that economic factors have played an important role in international relations throughout history. <#/>Economic objectives, resources, and instruments of foreign policy have always been significant elements in the struggles among political g
roups. <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Gilpin l989:4)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>
\par There are very many examples of the role of economic factors (trade, investments, finance) in the affairs of states. <#/>In Homeric times, Helen's face, contributing factor though it may have been, was the primary reason for launc
hing a thousand ships and causing King Agamemnon to lay siege to Troy. <#/>More likely the Greeks' crucial motive was their desire to seize control of the lucrative trade route that passed through the Dardanelles. <#/>Centuries later, the Persian empire u
s
ed its great hoard of gold to influence the foreign policies of lesser states. <#/>In the 5th century B.C., the Athenian closure of ports of the Delian League to an ally of its Spartan rival provides one of the earliest recorded cases of economic warfare.
 <#/>Thus far one can argue that history is replete with similar examples of the role of economic factors in the affairs of states; in this sense, the political economy of international relations has always existed. <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Gilpin 1989:16)
}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>
\par Although economic an
d political factors have had a reciprocal influence on one another throughout history, in the modern world this interaction has been transformed in fundamental ways. <#/>Over the past several centuries, the interdependence of national economies has increa
s
ed due to greatly enhanced flows of trade, finance, and technology. <#/>Public awareness of the economic content of political issues has also expanded, and people can more easily trace the causes of economic discontent or bounty to the specific actions of
 specific groups at home and abroad.
\par <#/>This is due to the realization that the state can be used to effect economic outcomes and, in particular, to distribute wealth in one's <AmE/>favor. <#/>It is for this reason that today the scourge of unemployment, t
he rampant inflation and the distribution of wealth are viewed as the result of human actions rather than as the consequences of some immutable economic laws.
\par <#/>This conclusion is only possible if one looks at the changes which have taken place. <#/>Firs
t, the nation-state has largely displaced such pre-modern forms of political organization as city states, tribes, and empires, while simultaneously the market has become the primary means for organizing economic relations, displacing other means of exchan
g
e: reciprocity, redistribution, and imperial command economies. <#/>These two opposed forms of social organization, the modern state and the market, and their mutual interactions have become increasingly crucial to the character and dynamics of internatio
n
al relations in our world. <#/>They have elevated economic issues to the highest level of international relations. <#/>The direction of financial flows, the inevitable shifts in comparative advantage, and the international distribution of productive activ
ities are preoccupations of modern statecraft.
\par <#/>The role of economic factors in international relations has been viewed differently by various schools of thought. <#/>Economic liberals believe that the benefits of an international division of <AmE/>labor
 based on the principle of comparative advantage cause markets to arise spontaneously and foster
\par harmony among states; they also believe that expanding webs of economic interdependence create a basis for peace and cooperation in the competitive and anarchi
cal state system. <#/>Economic nationalists on the other hand believe and stress the role of power in the rise of a market and the conflictual nature of international economic relations; they argue that economic interdependence must have a political found
a
tion and that it creates yet another arena of inter-state conflict, increases national vulnerability, and constitutes a mechanism that one society can employ to dominate. <#/>Marxists are divided into two groups; Leninists and Kauskites. <#/>Leninists bel
i
eve that market economies are by nature conflictual, and those of Lenin's chief followers, and protagonist, Karl Kautsky, who believe that market economies (at least the dominant ones) cooperate in the joint exploitation of the weaker economies of the glo
be.
\par <#/>Thus taking that stance, Marxists have criticised the market or capital society, that it tends to pursue an aggressive foreign policy. <#/>Liberals on the other hand, take the opposite position arguing that capitalist economies are fundamentally pac
ific <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Schumpeter 1951: 57)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>.
\par <#/>Marxists, liberals, and nationalists have long debated the issue of whether economic interdependence is a source of peaceful relations or a source of conflict among nation states.
\par <#/>Liberals believe that the mutual benefit
s of trade and the expanding web of interdependence among national economies tend to foster cooperative relations. <#/>They believe that war has become unthinkable because it is antithetical to modern industrial society and does not pay. <#/>But for natio
nalists trade is merely another arena for international competition because economic interdependence increases the insecurity of states and their vulnerability to external economic and political forces. <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Gilpin 1990: 26;3)}{
\fs24\lang2057 </X>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 .}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par The effects of trade, investm
ents, and finance on international relations is an area of intense controversy. <#/>From Montesque's statements that "peace is the natural effect of trade" to contemporary theorists of functionalist and economic interdependence, liberals have viewed inter
n
ational economics as separable from politics and as a force for peace. <#/>Whereas politics tends to divide, economics tends to unite peoples. <#/>Trade and Interdependence create bonds of mutual interest and a vested interest in international peace and t
h
us have moderating influence on international relations. <#/>The basic assumption of the Marxists and the economic nationalists, on the other hand is that international interdependence is not only a cause of conflict and insecurity, but it creates depende
nt relations among states. <#/>Because interdependence is never symmetrical, trade becomes a source of increasing the political power of the strong over the weak. <#/>Therefore, Marxists and economic nationalists advocate policies of economic autarky <X_>
}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Gilpin 1990: 49)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>.
\par <#/>The historical record does not lend much support to either position; the pattern of economic and political relations are highly contradictory. <#/>Political antagonists may be major trading partners as was the case with Great Britain and G
ermany in the First World War; or as was the case with the United States and the Soviet Union after the Second World War; they may have negligible economic intercourse. <#/>What the evidence suggests is that, whether trade aggravates or moderates conflict
s, is dependent upon the political circumstances. <#/>Attention therefore should be given to interrelated factors that appear to influence the ways in which trade affects international political relations.
\par <#/>The first factor affecting the political consequences of trade is the existence or absence of a dominant or hegemonic liberal power that can establish and manage the international trading system.
\par <#/>The great eras of economic interdependence have been identified with the unchallenged supremacy of hege
monic trading powers such as Great Britain in the nineteenth century and the United States after the Second World War. <#/>When the domination of these powers waned and they were challenged by rising powers, trade conflicts increased.
\par <#/>The second factor determining the political effects of trade is the rate of economic growth. <#/>The corollary is also true; a rapid rate of economic growth leads to increasing trade and economic interdependence.
\par <#/>By the same token, a slow down in the rate of economic growth makes adjustment difficult, intensifies international trade competition, and exacerbates international political relations.
\par <#/>The third factor affecting the political results of trading relations is the degree of homogeneity or heterogeneity of industrial structure, which in turn determines the composition of imports and exports <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Hicks 1969: 95)}{
\fs24\lang2057 </X>. <#/>Although it is true that industrial nations trade more with one another than <-/non industrial> countries, when nations have highly homogeneous or even
 similar industrial structures and exports, competitive trading relations and commercial conflict frequently results in periods of economic stagnation <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Hicks 1969: 56 - 57)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>
. <#/>By the same token heterogeneity of industrial structure tends to produce complementary trading relations.
\par <#/>Thus the heterogeneity of industrial structures of Great Britain and other nations in the early and mid-nineteenth century resulted in generally harmonious trading relations. <#/>As other nations industrialised by the end of
 the century, commercial conflicts became intense. <#/>The same phenomenon may be observed in the contemporary era, as rising industrial powers such Japan and the Newly Industrialising countries (NIC's) overtake and surpass the United States.
\par <#/>In a simi
lar tone and argument, one can turn to the role of finance and even investments, and yet find the same thread running. <#/>And the conclusion will be similar to the one made on trade; that no single variable can explain international relations.
\par <#/>However
 the role of finance and the control of a currency in international monetary system provides states in control with financial and monetary power. <#/>Both Great Britain in the nineteenth century and, to a much greater extent, the United States in the twen
tieth, have used to their own advantage, the right of seigniorage "which is the profit that comes to the seigneur, or sovereign power, from the issuance of money" <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (Kindleberg 1981: 248)}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>. 
<#/>The United States has also employed its financial power to reward its friends with access to capital markets and to punish enemies through denial of access.
\par <#/>Also in the case of the United States, the financial pre-requisites of the <-/hegemon> have been crucial to its ability to maintain its dominant position and domestic prosperity into the 1980's.
\par <#/>Even then, it is very difficult to sustain with certainty the assumption that an understanding of international relations is solely dependent on the knowledge of the patterns of trade, finance, and investments. <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Tak
ing the example of the relationship between Cuba and the United States before 1959, one can support the assertion. }{<#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 But taking the events of 1959, one wonders if the assertion is really valid. }{<#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
The truth is that there must be something more than trade, investments, and finance. }{<#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 In the case of Cuba, it was the prevailing political situation.
\par }{<#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Another example is what is going on in Eastern Europe. Most, if not all, of the Eastern European countries were dependent on the Soviet Union virtually on everything. }{<#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
The events which have taken place there do not support the argument. }{<#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 This therefore means that there are more factors than just trade, investment, and finance in understanding international relations.
\par <h> }{<#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 CONCLUSION </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 With all that said, a few concluding remarks need to be made. }{<#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
And the major point to be made in these matters is that trade and other economic factors like, investments and finance are not in themselves critical to the establishment of cooperative or conflictual international relations. }{<#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057

On the other hand the collapse of these economic factors has at times led to the outbreak of international conflict. }{<#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 In general, the chara

\par <I> <h> }{<#/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 REGULATION OF BUSINESS: MUTUAL PARTNERSHIP OR CONFRONTATION?</h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Government regulation of business is a common <-_phenomena><+_phenomenon> both in government and business circl
es. <#/>Neither the government nor the business community can ignore this reality. <#/>And there are justifiable reasons for this strange state business relationship. <#/>Indeed, state (state is preferred to government which has a more limited usage) regu
lation of business must be considered in a wider perspective as one of the many aspects of state business relationships. <#/>No business manager, let alone a financial manager can afford to ignore this relationship.
\par <#/>The success or failure of any enterprise, from its inception to its maturity, hinges on this relationship. <#/>Peter F. Drucker, an eminent scholar in the field of management had this to say about state business relationships:
\par A crucial social responsibility for the manager, and especially fo
r the business manager, is the relationship of business and government. <#/>Few relationships are as critical to the business enterprise itself as the relationship to government. <#/>The manager has responsibility for this relationship as part of his resp
onsibility to the enterprise itself.
\par <#/>State enterprise relationship is not the domain of any particular form of government. <#/>It exists both in capitalist countries of the west to socialist states in the east. <#/>Nor are third world, or the so called 
developing countries excluded. <#/>It is therefore essential that financial managers be conversant with the form and nature of state business relationship lest they fail their enterprises. <#/>This is crucial in order to re-emphasize that state business r
e
lationships be seen not as confrontational but rather as one of partnership. <#/>Indeed, to some extent, governments themselves are entrepreneurs, while other private entities operate as public realities. <#/>This reality has been observed by Drucker who 
declares that:
\par There are institutions that, while incorporated as private companies, are publicly owned and discharge public functions. <#/>There are also institutions which while government owned operate in fairly competitive markets and discharge "private
 sector" functions.
\par <#/>A Financial Manager }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>orth}{\fs24\lang2057 
 must also realize that, both public and private enterprises must deal with the state in one form or the other. <#/>They must not only cooperate as business partners, but both their survival as managers a
nd the survival of their enterprises depends on how they cooperate with the state. <#/>Moreover, to some extent, the survival of the government depends also on how business thrives both public and private. <#/>Business survival means an improved ability o
f the state, to deliver goods and services to its population. <#/>Inability to deliver, puts the legitimacy of the state into question, and hence its survival.
\par <#/>Both economic, political and social stability therefore depends on how business and state can
 join hands in a new partnership that can improve the social and material well being of the society that sustains them. <#/>This essentially means that this partnership must be able to guarantee the most basic needs of the community i.e. good living condi
t
ions in the form of adequate calorie intake in nutritious food, reasonable housing and shelter, basic education and health for all citizens. <#/>Included in the basket of basic needs is also state guarantee of human justice, and equality in the form of fr
ee speech, freedom of association, free press as well as protection of the environment that sustains the community. <#/>Now, this cannot be sustained either through private or public effort alone, only joint efforts can sustain this <AmE/>endeavor.
\par <#/>The 
success of this <AmE/>endeavor is the only way to guarantee the success of business. <#/>This is essentially the case because business can only thrive in a relatively, stable society. <#/>Stability can only be guaranteed when the community perceives the s
t
ate and enterprise to be supporting better living conditions for them. <#/>And this can be done when both civil and political rights are available. <#/>When economic justice prevails. <#/>In discussing the US economy and the need to forge new economic arr
angements in <AmE/>favor of economic justice for all, the US Bishops declared that,
\par The first step in such an effort is the development of a new cultural consensus that the basic economic conditions of human welfare are essential to human dignity and are du
e persons by right. <#/>Second, the securing of these rights will make demands on all members of society, on all private sector institutions, and on government.. . <#/>Indeed political democracy and a commitment to secure economic rights are mutually rein
forcing.
\par <#/>While Bishops in the USA are calling for joint efforts between the state and business entities in the USA such efforts are said to have been the story of economic miracles achieved in Brazil, as well as the newly industrialized nations of Asia.
 <#/>Unfortunately, however, industrial development in those countries, has not been able to guarantee political democracy and a commitment to secure economic rights for the majority of the population in these countries. <#/>State rules and regulations ca
ter for the rich few and suppresses the majority poor who are condemned to perpetual poverty.
\par <#/>Peter Evans, in an analysis of the Alliance of multinational, state and Local Capital in Brazil, concludes that:
\par The industrializing elite alliance that curren
tly holds sway in Brazilis inherently incapable of serving the needs of the mass of the population yet the pressure of their unsatisfied needs remains the constant backdrop for the elite's strategies of industrialization. . . but the redistribution of eco
nomic rewards and political power can only be postponed for a certain period. <#/>The workers who burned the buses will not remain indefinitely a passive audience.
\par <#/>Evans argues that unless the state and private business alliance redistributes the wealth
 generated, both stands to loose. <#/>For as soon as the pauperized majority perceives betrayal, they will pursue their rights through sporadic protests demanding economic and political justice. <#/>When protests become nasty and out of hand, business suf
fers while the state looses its legitimacy.
\par <#/>In short, whereas, the partnership between state and business can result in some sort of development to be precise, some sort of economic growth, such growth may be short-lived. <#/>It may be short-lived becau
se no development takes place. <#/>For development must take into consideration a whole package of social, political and economic justice for all. <#/>Otherwise, business as well as the state will end up as losers. <#/>Losers because the disenfranchised a
n
d marginalized poor will rise up against the alliance. <#/>They will revolt, and in the cause of rebellion tear down the semblance of growth. <#/>Business will suffer both material and moral losses. <#/>The criteria of business success is profit maximizat
i
on. <#/>And profits cannot be maximized when business property is torn and burnt down. <#/>Morally business will have failed to improve the well being of those who produce the mega profits, the exploited. <#/>The state is not exonerated either. <#/>When m
a
ss rebellion ensues because of unfulfilled basic demands, the prerequisites to development, the state is further alienated from the masses. <#/>An alienated and withdrawn state will not be sustained except through dictatorial use of coercive instruments o
f
 the state, the police and the army. <#/>Martial law rules supreme. <#/>This further undermines its ability to rule and puts into question its legitimacy. <#/>An illegitimate state cannot survive because it cannot guarantee property rights, the production
 and exchange of goods and services, the very heart and soul of business. <#/>In analyzing the swift economic growth of the newly industrialized countries of South East Asia, Frederic Deyo states that:
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 State led strategies in capitalist economies entail
 continuing. <#/>Selective intervention by state agencies in private sector decision making and market transactions to achieve strategic goals. . . suggests the importance of consistent, developmentalist, state-led, strategy for economic growth and restru
cturing in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
\par <#/>The suggestion here is that business boom in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore was mainly due to state interventionist policies in business. <#/>Unfortunately for the masses, the state in those instances w
as dictatorial. <#/>Economic growth was not followed by development, in the form of guarantees to minimum basic needs both material, political and social justice and protection of the environment. <#/>Business prospered because the state used both the car
r
ot and the stick to deal with business and only the stick to deal with the masses of the working people in these nation states. <#/>The state guaranteed business massive profits by denying workers the right to exercise their fundamental right. <#/>The rig
ht to strike. <#/>Low wages was a business present to the bourgeoisie. <#/>So were loans, subsidies and protection from foreign competition. <#/>These were given in exchange for investing in state priority sectors.
\par <#/>Since the legitimacy of the state was 
questionable foreign capital and troops were a vital element both to the survival of the state and the success of business. <#/>Thus, state business alliance is critical for both. <#/>However, when the workers and peasants, the bulk of the population is a
lienated, no one can enjoy the fruits of this success.
\par <#/>Riots are frequently reported in Seoul, South Korea and in Taipei Taiwan. <#/>Most often business suffers. <#/>Business therefore has a moral responsibility to make sure that their cooperation with 
the state ensures sustainable development for the benefit of all.
\par <#/>Africa is also a scene of fertile state business relationships. <#/>Given the high illiteracy rates of the African masses and their preoccupation with basic survival, they are rarely inv
olved in deciding their own fate. <#/>The state in this respect takes advantage of this phenomena, and make policies that partially reflects the "interests of the national elites and those of the population at large"
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 In the absence of legally organized
 opposition, and true mass representation, the state intervenes in business decisions, most often in <AmE/>favor of the dominant business elite. <#/>The African elite constitutes the state bourgeoisie as well as private capital in the nation state. <#/>Th
is <-/infact> forms the basis of state business relationship. <#/>Beno Ndulu, has explained this <-_phenomena><+_phenomenon> as simply another dominant characteristic of African regimes, stating that:
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Another dominant characteristic of African regimes i
s the close link between the state bureaucracy and the private sector, both foreign and indigenous. <#/>Elites use state power either independently or in conjunction with private entrepreneurs to enter into the business sphere, tending to create a strong 
symmetry of interests between the private sector and the state bureaucracy.
\par <#/>State business cooperation in this context is obvious. <#/>Given the low living standards of the African masses which is not guaranteed its supply of a full basket of basic need
s, it means that, at least, in the short run, this business alliance between the public and private bourgeoisie is beneficial to commercial interests, but detrimental to sustained development in the long run. <#/>Yet, most reformers unwittingly <AmE/>clam
o
r for more doses of the very policies that have hampered African development. <#/>As Paul Okojie succinctly put it, "It is quite remarkable that the World Bank is urging African Countries to pursue the very economic path which has been the source of their
 poverty and misery".
\par <#/>The economic path mentioned is unfortunately the very one also propounded by IMF, i.e. open the African, economy more and more to the mercy of international finance capital. <#/>Of course, the very alliance between state and privat
e bourgeoisie in the African nation states is viewed as a healthy situation. <#/>So long as international capital dominates, and free reign of market forces sustain business. <#/>Mass poverty and misery do not count so long as maximum profits are generate
d for the consumption of the local bourgeoisie and repatriated by global capitalists through their transnational corporations.
\par <#/>For Tanzania, following this economic path has meant the reinforcement of state business cooperation in <AmE/>favor of private
 capital. <#/>This has translated into an all out effort to create <AmE/>favorable conditions for private capital which meant passing laws guaranteeing non-appropriation, tariff protection, duty relief on imported raw materials and component parts of mach
i
nery, tax holidays, export profits etc. <#/>This view is shared by Hardley Smith, who emphasizes state support of private business by providing, "all reasonable guarantees for carrying out its business in conditions sufficiently attractive to induce the r
einvestments of profits in Tanganyika and an inflow of new investments from abroad. <#/>" Such conditions included the incentive package mentioned above. }{\fs24\lang2057 <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 <#/>It is an open secret that, where as the 
state has provided the requested <AmE/>favor, no real development has taken place in Tanzania. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The masses are still reeling in poverty and deprivation.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The justification for state intervention in Business: }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 There are both political and economic justifications for nurturing state business relations. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Politically, the state is seen as an instrument of political sovereignty and therefore in a position to maintain the moral integrity of society. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Given that business, in particular transnational business entities have no boundaries, the state is theoretically viewed as a standard bearer of what is good and wrong in society. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
This can be conceptualized only under the assumptions that freedom and liberty is available to all and a monopoly of all society, not a privileged few. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 That, the state is duly
 constituted by the good will of all society with all the guarantees of civil, and economic justice for all the citizens. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
That is, the community can elect in or vote out a government is a precondition for basic democracy. In the absence of such a common will, the state ceases to be representative. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
It cannot sustain as the standard bearer and provider of all basic needs. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Hence it ceases to be a major instrument of development.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Business, by its very nature, represents the interests of its owners and not that of a whole society. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Even state enterprises, when they are used for private gain do not belong to its owners, but that of its usurpers. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 This brings about a legitimation crisis of the bourgeois state. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Such crisis is close to Jurgen Habermas Legitimation crisis caused by a break from "precapitalist to capitalist state". }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
According to Habermas, "this dismantling of the old order by the new order has produced both a profound split between the political system and the capacity to le
gitimate it for social and moral acceptance, as well as a search for new legitimative strategies".
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Thus, when state control means the use of public property for private gain, it removes all sense of accountability to the community, and the state ceases to be an instrument of societal development. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Both the state and private business are alienated from those they are supposed to serve. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 But this does not automatically disconnect state business links although it weakens them. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 This has a negative
 effect on business. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The erosion of legitimacy brings into question one important justification for state intervention in a market economy. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
That of defining and enforcing property rights efficiently and effectively. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Under normal circumstances, 
a market activity i.e. production and exchange of goods and services necessary for the realization of business profits, is only possible where there are no conflicts arising from property ownership. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
This determines what type of owner ship is allowed by law. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Experts are of the opinion that "in terms of efficiency, government may be able to resolve the conflicts of interest more economically than would private attempts to settle disputes on a case by case basis". }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
This efficiency is made possible because, the state can back ownership claims with threats to unleash the coercive instruments of the state i.e. police, jails etc. for violators. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Moreover, economies of scale can be realized, hence efficiency in resources use. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Such sanctions are bas
ically a public good, since "the resource expended to protect one claim could also serve to protect any other government backed claim". }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
It is common knowledge that the market is inefficient in dealing with public goods due to free rider problems, hence the need and justification state intervention.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 However the erosion of state legitimacy, may ultimately rob its power to enforce sanctions. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 This ability comes from the body politic. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
The good will of the masses of the population, the final arbiter of legitimate power in free democracies. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 If this good will is alienated, due to withdrawal of support by the disenchanted public, business suffers. }{\v <#/>}{
\v\fs24\lang2057 Business suffers because as Pogue and Sgontz correctly argues:
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 In the absence of such government sanctioned rights, more resources would likely be devoted to both thievery and the protection of property, with fewer resources being allocated to the production of goods and services. }{\v 
<#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Moreover, there would be less incentive to engage in production and exchange because of the fear that one's product might be stolen or an exchange agreement might be violated...}{\v\fs24\lang2057\super 14}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Entrepreneurs do not want to invest where more of their resources will be needed to protect their properties than to generate maximum profits for their shareholders. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Peace and tranquillity are essential pre-conditions for a conducive business climate.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Pogue and Sgontzs' above scenario is an extreme condition where the erosion of legitimacy has led to lawlessness. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 No business can thrive under such conditions. South Africa is a good example. }{\v 
<#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Although international sanctions have been eased, new investments are not forthcoming due to township violence. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 But lack of popular support do not lead to inability to enforce propert
y rights and exchange alone. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 A chaotic situation where the state cannot use its coercive instruments may lead to inequality in the distribution of the national wealth. 
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 If the sate cannot ensure equitable distribution of goods and services, the poorest of the poor will continue to be suppressed by the rich, further alienating the public.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Violent riots and protests will ensue. Demonstrations and civil disobedience will disrupt the normal conduct of business. Intervention in <AmE/>favor of equity 
is therefore essential to safeguard both business and state interests. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
It must also be emphasized, that the market does not only fail in defining and enforcing property rights and rules of exchange, but the market is also inefficient when dealing with externalities. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
The market fails to deal with externalities because most of the time this may mean extra costs to the business entity. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Since the primary goal of a producer is to decrease the costs of production any extra cost of production and exchange is not a welcome <AmE/>endeavor. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Moreover, controls of such costs of pollution by industry is a protection to the environment. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 However, because business is geared towards the satisfaction of private goods, only the state can intervene on behalf
 of the community. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 As far as society is concerned, protecting the environment is part of the basic needs package, a prerequisite to any real societal development.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The state realizes that as part of its legitimation campaign, just as critical as the
 definition and protection of property rights, is the effort to protect the environment by assigning the burden of producing business externalities i.e. pollution or limiting such costs to those who generate them. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
The state can successfully deal with such costs, by either imposing taxes or placing limits through standards and regulating on the extent of maximum pollution that can be released to the environment. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
In this way, economic pundits would conclude that the state would have fulfilled one of its basic function. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 That of allocating resources where market mechanisms have failed.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The state can also deal with business by introducing standards and regulations in the conduct of business. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Accordingly, such enforcement of business exchange would involve costs. }{\v <#/>}{
\v\fs24\lang2057 However, "the cost of complying with the standards would be borne by the producers or their customers or by both". }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
The problem of such an exercise is to decide what level of business conduct would be considered as "the standard" i.e. what would be the yard stick of such conduct. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
In addition to deciding on the standard measure, is the problem of enforcement. }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Setting and enforcing business standard conduct, depends once again to the capacity of the state in question to effe
ctively intervene in economics and society. <#/>Such capacity is predetermined by the legitimacy of the state. <#/>If legitimacy is not doubtful, the capacity to intervene is not an issue.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Apart from intervention by setting acceptable norms of business
 conduct, the state can also impose taxes whose net result is again to influence or to regulate business. <#/>Normally, the decision of where to invest and in what type of business can be influenced by the type of taxes improved. <#/>The types of taxes im
proved and the type of tax incentives such as tax holidays, tax concessions such as exemptions can promote or deter business. <#/>Taxes can be used to deal with externalities, in the same manner as standards and regulations.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The costs of regulating busi
ness can be borne by either the producers alone, or they can be shifted to the consumers, or they can be shared by both producers and consumers. <#/>This is often the case where taxes are imposed to control pollution. <#/>The state can also relate with bu
siness by way of incomes and prices policies. <#/>Accordingly, most states have a tendency to set minimum wage policies and rates of annual increments.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 In this way both the entrepreneur and the consumer are protected. <#/>At least theoretically. <#/>In 
practice however, workers end up to be the losers. <#/>Their wages are fixed while business has a way with manipulation of prices. <#/>Suffice it to say that:
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The manipulation of prices to facilitate allocations of resources has been a common practice 
of many sub-Saharan African governments. <#/>In general, such practices have generated price distortions that result in inefficient use of resources.}{\v\fs24\lang2057\super 
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 In a mixed economy such as that of Tanzania, price controls have always been maximized by private busi
ness to generate windfall profits. <#/>Most often they would hoard goods and solicit price rises on the excuse that the costs of production have gone up. <#/>Consumers are losers. <#/>On the other hand the parastatal sector has on certain cases been under
sold by private business selling second
\par class cheap imports. <#/>There are also possibilities of misallocation of resources as suggested above, while price fixing may have also been used to buy political influence. <#/>To enhance business production and exc
hange, care has to be taken to set price levels that would protect the consumer, where it is absolutely necessary and politically expedient, otherwise, price fixing that creates biases against normal business exchange has to be discarded.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 There are oth
er ways of regulating business. <#/>One such other way is through fixed exchange rates. <#/>These are rates at which local currency can be exchanged for foreign currencies. <#/>This tremendously influences import export business. <#/>Fixing exchange rates
 
can have a negative effect, especially when the local currency is over valued, making local exports <-/incompetitive> in the world market. <#/>"In effect, maintaining overvalued exchange rates penalized those sectors dependent on exports, such as tourism 
and manufacturing, and made imports more attractive. <#/>" With foreign exchange constraints, this becomes a disservice to the national economy.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The state can also influence business expansion or limit it through physical trade restrictions. <#/>Most de
veloping countries use the excuse of protecting their infant industries to slap import controls. <#/>This is often done by way of foreign exchange restrictions, and the bureaucratic allocation of such foreign exchange. <#/>Another method commonly used is 
the imposition of import licenses along with a long list of import restrictions.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Trade restrictions have a negative result in society, especially in encouraging smuggling and bureaucratic corruption. <#/>Both business and the state loses. <#/>Resource a
llocation is distorted, people lose faith in the official organs of the state and official business is undermined by dubious business dealings by smugglers. <#/>And the government suffers a double jeopardy in the form of lost tax revenue while its legitim
acy crisis overflows.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Interest rates when properly utilized can help to promote business. <#/>However, if improperly managed, interest rates can hamper profitable business. <#/>The state can usually use interest rates to stabilize the economy and improv
e business performance. <#/>This can be done by manipulating interest rates i.e. raising them to curb inflationary pressure or depress them to spur investments. <#/>When interest rates turn negative, under high inflationary conditions, as was the case in 
Tanzania in the mid 70's they demotivate savings. <#/>Rwegasira was able to demonstrate that this was indeed a cause of declining savings rates in Tanzania."}{\v\fs24\lang2057\super 
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Declining savings, means that credit facilities to business may also be restricted, thus hamper
ing smooth operations of business. <#/>On  the other hand, low interest rates may encourage excessive borrowings especially by governments that have failed to mobilize adequate tax revenues. <#/>Deficit financing is common by most governments. <#/>However
,
 when it is allowed to become the norm it has a negative impact on business. <#/>This is especially the case where the state competes with business for limited credit facilities and accords itself priority over business. <#/>But most important is the<-/sp
e
cture> of huge debt burden accrued to borrowing states. <#/>Eventually they have to be paid up, and most likely business will be forced to participate in debt repayments in the form of higher corporate taxes as well as taxes on inputs. <#/>This may have a
 negative and distorting influence in the allocation of scarce resources in the nation State.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 High public debts are also a burden to all the citizens. <#/>They do not only risk the freedom and integrity of the nation in the eyes of foreign creditors, bu
t create economic hardships. <#/>The state is most often forced to abdicate its social responsibilities. <#/>Most African States, Tanzania included have been forced to enter into agreements with IMF and swallowed the bitter pill of IMF conditionalities. <
#
/>This has forced them to withdraw subsidies and cut down their budgets on social services such as education and health. <#/>To Tanzania this has meant shelving away some of its fundamental principles of providing basic needs to all her citizenry. <#/>Bus
iness does not benefit under such a political and economic environment, at least not in the long run.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 There are many other ways that the state can influence business. <#/>Apart from the control of production and distribution of scarce raw materials, the
 use of import and export licensing, building licensing, the state can also control the location of industry. <#/>This is most often done to make sure that industries are not concentrated only in one part of the country but are spread all over the country
. <#/>The distribution of industry can also be done to fight unemployment in areas considered hard pressed.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Locating industry out of concentrated areas may not carry <AmE/>favor with business. <#/>Where as the state may want to distribute the benefits o
f growth over the whole nation state by moving new investments out of concentrated areas with low unemployment to create jobs where unemployment is high, business may be <AmE/>skeptical. <#/>Business is often keen to maximize on advantages of concentratio
n
 of industry. <#/>Such benefits include the development of specialized industries, individual financing in single processes or commodities, evolvement of supporting firms to service major industries and the creation of highly organized markets to cater fo
r the industrial district.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 In view of these benefits individual businesses may as well "be attracted to a highly concentrated area by the prospect of low operating costs". <#/>Industry would like to take advantages of economies of scale. <#/>However, gi

he location of industry.

This can be done by designating some areas as sights for new industrial development. <#/>Various inducements are also provided to attract business to such designated areas. <#/>These include declaring some areas as free trade zo

\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The state can also promote business in ways other than planning as envisaged above by the "encouragement of joint consultation in industry and assistance in the settlement of disputes and the support of training schemes..."}{

legislate anti-trust laws as in the USA to avert monopolistic tendencies in business that may hamper fair competition. <#/>Apart from efforts to discourage unfair business practices, the state may be obliged to set and enforce, not only minimum conditions

, (which, in principle allows creation of private banks), the }{\i\fs24\lang2057 Tanzania Postal Bank}{\fs24\lang2057 , the }{\i\fs24\lang2057 Loans and Advances Realization Trust}{\fs24\lang2057  and the }{\i\fs24\lang2057 
National Investment (Promotion and Protection Act) of 1989}{\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>This "opening up" of the financial sector and the economy as a whole is expected to be intensified, partly through the restructu
ring of the National Bank of Commerce (NBC) and the National Insurance Corporation (NIC) along the lines proposed by the Presidential Commission of inquiry on Monetary and Banking System.
\par <#/>1.3 Furthermore, it is the objective of this paper to point out 
and explain briefly some of the necessary tools and skills needed to undertake, more professionally, marketing activities at the branch and corporate levels of our financial institutions. <#/>It is our sincere hope that at the conclusion of this paper and
 subsequent discussions on the issue raised therein, most of the Chief Executives, if not all, will }{\i\fs24\lang2057 be marketing or consumer-oriented}{\fs24\lang2057 
 in their thinking and operations. <#/>In other words, they should go back to their work stations and professionally market their products (services) more purposively, scientifically and effectively.
\par <#/>1.4 In this presentation, we first explore the Tanzanian financial Marketing Scene in a bid to determine its adequacy or inadequacy in the application of the marketing concept 
in our financial institutions. <#/>The exploratory survey is achieved in Section Two of this paper. <#/>The following Section looks at what marketing and the marketing concept is. <#/>The aim here is to look at an "ideal" marketing philosophy and contrast
 
it with the "practice" as seen in the preceding Section. <#/>Possible reasons for the failure of our banks to apply the marketing concept in their operations follows in Section Four, Section Five, then proceeds to justify the need for a marketing orientat
ion of our financial institutions in general, and banks, in particular. <#/>Section Six then looks at the tools of marketing and their application in the marketing of financial services.
\par 2.0 <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Bank Marketing: The Tanzanian Style </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The opening p
aragraph of this paper is probably an extreme case of the way THB views marketing negatively. <#/>After all THB knows about advertising and actually advertises its services vide the radio and newspapers. <#/>It also has a fully fledged Public Relations De
p
artment. <#/>But that is all. <#/>This national company with a branch in every region does not have a marketing department, let alone a marketing officer! <#/>It would appear that marketing research, one of the corner stones of marketing is completely unk
nown to THB!
\par <#/>2.1 The Co-operative and Rural Development Bank (CRDB) is not much better than THB, either. <#/>Marketing is a diffused section within the Directorate of Banking. <#/>But even here, it does not use the name "marketing". <#/>Instead it is te
rmed "business development", whatever its meaning.
\par <#/>2.2 Our largest and oldest commercial bank, the National Bank of Commerce (NBC) should give us a more complete picture about the level of marketing activities among our banks. <#/>The Daily News editio
n of Monday, April 23, 1990 carried the following bizarre news about the collapsing of two NBC customers while "trying" to collect their money at the city Branch in Dar es Salaam
\par 'Two people collapsed.... as they queued for their money.... <#/>A Tanzania News Agency Shihata
\par reporter who witnessed the incident said the two fellows had allegedly spent more than four hours at the bank ....
\par <#/>In another development at the same branch, tellers were shouting to customers that "those with cheques with big amounts of money not to waste their time" as the bank had not enough cash. <#/>"<ea_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Mwenye Cheki kubwa aondoke, hakuna fedha}{\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>" one teller was quoted as telling customers".
\par <#/>2.3 This story reminds us of the many }{\i\fs24\lang2057 de-marketing practices}{\fs24\lang2057  which were typical o
f the Tanzanian Marketing scene during the 1974-1984 decade of scarcity of consumer goods and service, price controls and controls in the distribution of goods and services through the policy of ''confinement". <#/>At that time it was usual to spend the w
hole day trying to buy a kilogram of sugar, a pair of <ea/>khanga, a bar of soap or a bus ticket to Songea. <#/>But whereas trade }{\i\fs24\lang2057 liberalization}{\fs24\lang2057 
 seems to have forced many Tanzanian producers, importers and other middlemen (wholesalers and retailers) to be c
onsumer or marketing-oriented in their business undertakings, our banks continue to operate in the traditional fashion of "selling" rather than marketing.
\par <#/>2.4 The NBC }{\i\fs24\lang2057 Annual Report}{\fs24\lang2057  and Accounts for the year ended 30th June, 1988 has 57 (English) pages,
 but it does not carry a single word of "marketing". <#/>This is despite the fact that the Chairman and Managing Director of NBC repeats his Company's "Credo" of offering services to customers which are "qualitatively of the highest degree, prompt, effici
ent courteous and personalized". <#/>This, indeed, is paying lip service to marketing and it is no wonder that the same report shows a }{\i\fs24\lang2057 decline }{\fs24\lang2057 
in demand, time and savings depositors by 14.3%,7.6% and 7.0%, respectively from 1986/87 to 1987/88 period. <#/>It is also not surprising for the bank to treat its customers with utter contempt and indifference as reported above!
\par <#/>2.5 The limited application of the marketing concept (to be explained in the next Section) is demonstrated by the way the marketing func
tion is treated in NBC's organizational set-up. <#/>As early as 1973 this company seems to have appreciated the importance of the marketing function by placing it under a Chief Manager, although the title of this function was "Development", rather than "M
a
rketing". <#/>In subsequent years we have seen this department being stripped off of its powers, and relegated to a mere section, and again lifted to a division, etc. <#/>For instance in 1984 it was a full department under the functional name of "Developm
e
nt"; In 1986 the department was relegated and placed under Planning and Research and in 1987 it was again upgraded to a division but placed under the Directorate of Domestic Banking. <#/>This Directorate deals with loans and overdrafts. <#/>In the circums
t
ances it is so busy with borrowers that it rarely has sufficient time to think about marketing. <#/>As a matter of fact the Department is over-shadowed by other seemingly more important functions. <#/>Thus the marketing function's uncertainty about its "p
osition" in the organizational set-up of NBC renders it ineffective and subject to ridicule. <#/>Appendix 1 shows the present (1989) organizational set-up of NBC.
\par <#/>2.6 While organizationally, NBC does not seem to have recognized and accepted Marketing as
 an important function, it has slowly and painfully been improving its marketing practices. <#/>A notable area in this regard is marketing research as a key input in marketing planning. <#/>Prior to 1983 market research for the Company was limited to soci
o
-economic surveys which were, in essence an exercise of resource taking. <#/>However crude as they might have been, they accounted for many branches opened between 1967 and 1983. <#/>These surveys were accompanied with past data on the performance of the 
economy as well as the data on growth trends on deposits. <#/>This information was used to determine market potentials, an important ingredient of a market plant.
\par <#/>2.7 Beginning 1984/85 NBC introduced performance budgeting based on some limited market an
alysis. <#/>This analysis was based on demographic data and data on economic activities. <#/>The problem here is that most of these surveys were hurriedly carried out, and were done by people with little or no knowledge at all of marketing and marketing r
esearch. <#/>However, the most serious deficiency in most of these surveys was the absence of research on customer attitudes towards banking services, the driving forces that determine customer\rquote 
s decision to bank with NBC or with other banks, and a study of
 unsatisfied needs in respect of financial services. <#/>In other words NBC as well as other banks in the country have not bothered to know their markets in terms of characteristics and consumer <AmE/>behavior. <#/>They have taken them for granted.
\par <#/>2.8 The National Insurance Corporation (NIC) appears to be the only financial institution in the country with a fully fledged marketing function. <#/>This function is highly placed within the company\rquote 
s organizational set-up (Directorate level). <#/>This set-up, plus the company\rquote s country-wide \rdblquote marketing agency\'94 system has contributed significantly to NIC\rquote 
s savings mobilization (Ref. <#/>To Appendix 2 which shows substantial increase of both nominal and real deposits between 1978 and 1988), although part of this increase can be attributed to the statutory nature of some of NIC\rquote s Insurance schemes.

\par <#/>2.9 One can conclude this section by saying that to the National Bank of Commerce, the THB and to most other banks in the country, marketing is advertising. <#/>Or
 it is advertising and public relations. <#/>Or it is advertising, public relations and selling. <#/>Or it is all those plus research. <#/>But all these are not enough in and of themselves.
\par <#/>2.10 Most Tanzanian banks have a very narrow view of marketing
. <#/>As will be discussed later, this position is understandable. <#/>Acceptance of marketing in the USA and Europe is dated as late as the 1960s and it was not until the 1970s that marketing of banking became a widely discussed topic in British Banking 
C
ircles. <#/>One reason for the delay  in accepting marketing is the nature of banking to be discussed later. <#/>The illusion of having a face to face relationship with customers, (or) the absence of intermediaries, has made the financial institutions flo
under in the application of the marketing concern whose important pillar is consumer service and satisfaction.
\par 3.0 <h> }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The Marketing Concept: A Reflection </h>
\par }{<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Companies can design great products, but if they cannot reach their customers, or if potential buyers remain unconvinced to buy, then all is for naught. <#/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 Marketing }{\fs24\lang2057 
is an essential business discipline that tests the company\rquote s product or service against the customers\rquote  willingness to buy at a price that is not only acceptable to them but also 
generates an acceptable profit to the company. <#/>The central place of the consumer in the success of a firm has led to the development of the so-called "marketing concept".
\par <#/>3.1 The way the }{\i\fs24\lang2057 marketing concept}{\fs24\lang2057  is interpreted varies quite considerably as
 almost every text-book of marketing has its own definition. <#/>However, there seems to be a common thread cutting across authors, practitioners and politicians alike. <#/>Probably the best way of understanding the marketing concept is to contrast it wit
h the sales concept ("selling" or "product concept" or orientation).
\par <#/>Two eminent scholars of marketing have made an excellent distinction of the two, almost opposing concepts: Theodore Levitt and Phillip Kotler. }{<X_>}{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Thus according to Levitt:
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 "Sellin
g focuses on the needs of the seller, marketing on the needs of the buyer. <#/>Selling is pre-occupied with the seller's need to convert his product into cash; marketing with the idea of satisfying the needs of the customer by means of the produce and the
 whole cluster of things associated with creating, delivering and finally consuming it."}{\v\fs24\lang2057\super 1}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Thus the distinction between the two concepts is stark clear: The marketing concept is outward-looking towards customer needs; selling, on the other hand is inward-looking toward products or services. <#/>It is myopic.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 3.2 The figure below further illustrates the difference between the sales concept and the marketing concept. <#/>Companies pursuing the sales concept or product orientation, as is the case with mo
st of our financial institutions, will direct their attention on producing or creating a service, the goal being to achieve profits through sales volumes. <#/>This would be achieved through very high pressure selling and heavy advertising campaigns. <#/>T
h
e company pursuing the marketing concept, on the other hand, works differently. <#/>It cannot afford to rely on its products (services) or those technical skills it possesses. <#/>Instead it puts the customer in focus since "the customer is the business'.
 <#/>To this company, the goal is to achieve profits through }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 customer satisfaction}{\v\fs24\lang2057 , thereby using integrated marketing as a means to achieve this end. <#/>The concept of }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 integrated marketing}{
\v\fs24\lang2057  refers to a situation whereby customer needs become the guiding force for all activities in the company.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 3.3 The implication's of the marketing approach are many. <#/>First, with this approach there is need to have broad }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 corporate objective}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 or mission, one that is based on the present and potential }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 needs of the market }{\v\fs24\lang2057 and not one that is based on }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 current products}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>Such a corporate mission will enable a company to be dynamic and keep abreast of the }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 changing environment}{\v\fs24\lang2057  in the market.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 An example here are the commercial banks which traditionally have thought of themselves as being in the "banking business" }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 Instead}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 of being in the business of "providing financial services" for their depositors and borrowers. <#/>
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The former is sales orientation and accordingly myopic. <#/>The latter -"marketing of financial ser
vices" is broader, outward sounding, dynamic and in line with the marketing concept. <#/>With this objective in mind, the bank's "services" become widened to include safe-keeping of funds, investment of funds, making money available when needed, keeping r
e
cords and giving expert advice on personal and corporate financial management. <#/>In the case of THB whose other function is the "provision of housing finance'' it could widen its scope to cover all housing-related finance including advice on low-cost ho
using, hire purchase, etc.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 3.4 Secondly, pursuance of the marketing concept requires extensive and scientific use of }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 marketing research}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 to assess the present and future needs of customers, the objective being to identify and concentrate on most profitab
le markets now and in the future. <#/>Marketing studies and analyses should ideally precede the opening up of new bank or insurance branches or agencies, or the introduction of a new savings mobilization scheme. <#/>Like-wise, before THB decides to build 
low-cost houses for hire purchase it should ideally study the market potential for those houses.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Marketing research covers many areas including product or service research, advertising, distribution, etc.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 3.5 The third, and probably the most importa
nt implication of the marketing concept concerns the place or position of the marketing function in the organizational set up of a company. <#/>If indeed, a company's objectives are to be directed out of customer needs, and if marketing is to become a cen
t
ral function at all levels, it is natural that this function be elevated vertically. <#/>In the sales-oriented company the marketing function more or less serves the production people. <#/>In the case of banking operations these are managers in the direct
orates of Domestic and International Banking.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 In the customer or marketing-oriented company it should be the other way round. <#/>The initiative should, instead, come from the marketing people. <#/>The production and other functions in the Company have 
to adjust production schedules, product or service quality, materials, personnel, finances, etc., according to signals from the marketing people.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Organizationally, therefore, it might appear that all functions of a marketing-oriented firm should be brought under marketing, although the }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 conventional}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 approach is to give each function an }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 equal}{\v\fs24\lang2057  status in the organizational hierarchy.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 3.6 Irrespective of the organizational structure being used, the marketing concept can still be applied. <#/>The most imp
ortant thing is the practice of marketing rather than the organization <-_perse><+_per se>. <#/>Marketing, irrespective of its positioning, should come into the picture right from the time a new product or service is being contemplated, and it should rema
i
n the driving force in subsequent developments such as designing the product/service, introducing it, phasing it out, etc. <#/>Of course the amount of this "influence" would, under normal circumstances, depend on the level and seniority of the person who 
heads this function. <#/>The higher his level the more effective he will be in making the company marketing-oriented.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 3.7 It is our hope that this exposition of the marketing concept has helped expose the inadequacy of our financial institutions in the 
application of this concept. <#/>In all fairness they are far from being marketing-oriented. <#/>But is it necessary that they should? This question is pursued in the next Section.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 4.0 <h> The Marketing of Financial Services in a Seller's Market </h>
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
It is necessary to point out here that application of the marketing concept by business firms is more relevant and compelling under certain economic conditions usually referred to as a buyer's market. <#/>Characteristics of a buyer's market include the 
following:
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
- Free supply of goods and services, particularly when supply exceeds demand. <#/>This gives rise to intense competitions among product or service suppliers. <#/>In this situation the consumer has a choice of many almost equally well-matched
 brands or services.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 - Competition at distribution point: there are no bottlenecks in the distribution chain and all brands are well represented at all relevant distribution outlets in the entire market.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 - Increase in personal disposable income, leading to greater mass market opportunity which in turn contributes to intense competition among suppliers in the market.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 - A rapid change in technology in the economy, contributing to more and more technological "sameness" among competing products and 
services e.g. electronic funds transfer technology, automatic teller equipment, etc. <#/>In circumstances where competing products may be more or less alike e.g. soft drinks, deodorants, }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 checking accounts}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 etc., marketing tends to emerge as the only opportu
nity to distinguish one firm from its competition. <#/>For example, even though Bank D may be unable to market a superior checking account from a "technical" point of view, the same bank may still achieve a disproportionately high share of the market in c
hecking accounts by undertaking cross-selling, "packaging" of such accounts with other services, sensitive pricing practices, well executed advertising, etc.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 - Changing in the social, economic and political environment affecting the shape and nature of 
markets. <#/>As the market changes so must the firm that serves it. <#/>It is a marketer's job to "manage" the market by initiating change which is within the control of the firm.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 4.1 Companies in a }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 Seller's Market}{\v\fs24\lang2057 , on the other hand tend to rely less 
and less on marketing in carrying out their activities. <#/>Such a market is the 1974-84 decade of scarcity which rocked Tanzania. <#/>Some of the characteristics of a seller's market are:
\par - Scarcity of goods, and rationing.
\par - Price control and control of the distribution function
\par - Monopoly or cartel (i.e. absence of competition).
\par - Low margins for marketing.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Business in a market like this thus leads to complacency on the part of "marketers" and their inability to measure fully the success or failure o
f a product or service on its own merit. <#/>Other problems related with a seller' s market are high pricing and inability on the part of marketers to know the real size of the market since demand tends to be unduly exaggerated in a shortage situation. 

\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
4.2 This appears to have been the <AmE/>behavior of our financial institutions as observed in Section Two of this paper. <#/>The reason for lack of marketing orientation for most of our financial institutions is partly the seller's market in which they h
ave been operating. <#/>A closer look at the markets of financial institutions shows this to be true.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 4.3 The Market of a financial institution has three dimensions, and these are shown in Figure Two below. <#/>First and foremost is the }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 Savings Market}{\v\fs24\lang2057  
- people and organizations whose current resources exceed their planned expenditure and have a need of "saving" this excess in a bank or another financial institution. <#/>The financial institution must attract this market in order to serve the credit or 
l
oan market, on the one hand, and the market for the extended "financial services, on the other. <#/>In other words the "Savings Market" provides money which can be equated to "raw materials" on which credit as well as other financial services are based. <
#
/>It is true that the banking industry can "buy" a proportion of its raw materials (money) in the money market (equity capital, loan, etc.); but an important proportion of its raw materials has to be gained by persuading individuals or corporate organizat
i
ons to deposit their funds with it. <#/>And persuasion is a marketing function. <#/>Appendix 3 shows that private savings have for the last 18 years (1970-18=987) stood at an average of 70 percent of total savings. <#/>This is the market that financial in
stitutions should concentrate on. 
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 4.4 The "Savings Market" prefers more cash (i.e. higher interest rate) to less cash; cash sooner rather than later (i.e. a shorter investment period) and minimal risk of cash inflows. <#/>In short:
\par price = f (amount, timing, risk of cashflows).
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 4.5 On the other hand the banker has another market to serve: the credit market or those individuals or organizations whose spending plans exceed their current resources. <#/>This market is usually the largest source of a ban
k's revenue, realizable through interest charged on the credit consumer. <#/>These prefer lower interest rates and longer borrowing times.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 4.6 The characteristics of the Markets of financial institutions classified above have since the late 70's (after
 the Arusha Declaration) exhibited the culture of a seller's market. <#/>Some of the reasons for this situation are:
\par - Shortage of financial services
\par - Limited competition
\par - Government control 
\par - Low disposable income.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 4.7 Tanzania is currently facing 
a shortage of financial services for both the Savings and Credit markets as well as for the extended financial services. <#/>Appendix 4 shows the number of banking outlets available to the Tanzanian market in 1989. <#/>The number of branches was too small
 
in relation to the population they served. <#/>On the average we had more than 100,000 people per branch and the ratio ranged from 80,000 in the Coast Region to 177,000 in Dodoma Region. <#/>To a large extend the Tanzanian market is still under banked, an
d the situation is made worse by the obsolete and archaic banking technology and facilities still being used. <#/>As a result of this the staff of the banks have been overloaded in their operations, culminating into inefficiency and poor service.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 4.8 Fo
r most banks the shortage of banking services is compounded by a shortage of "raw materials" or funds to effect their lending operations, resulting in frustrating the creditor/loan market. <#/>For example, the Karadha Company, a hire purchase financing co
m
pany has been recording a decreasing number of units financed. <#/>This is also true in respect of THB's mortgage loans. <#/>For example this company's loan disbursements has gone down from Shs.190 million in 1983/84 to Shs.130 million in 1989t/90, a decl
ine of 30 percent. <#/>During the decade of 1979-1988 real lending by our commercial banks has declined by about 8 }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 percent. 
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 4.9 Another factor contributing to the minimal application of the marketing concept in the financial services' sector is its lim
ited competition resulting from clear cut "allocation" of services to each financial institution. <#/>Table 3 below shows the demarcation of the saving market, on the one hand, and the loan/credit market among our financial institutions, on the other. <#/
>
In so far as the Savings Market is concerned we have only four banks competing for the savings and time depositors. <#/>These are the National Bank of Commerce, (PBZ for Zanzibar), Tanzania Housing Bank (THB), and the Post Office Savings Bank (TPOSB). <#/
>
Current accounts, on the other hand, are offered only by two banks, (NBC and CRDB) although THB has plans to enter into this market segment. <#/>Four Banks are not enough to offer the competitive pressure required to make them consumer-oriented. <#/>This 
problem is compounded by the shortage of banking facilities and money as explained in Section 4.6, above.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 4.10 The Credit Market, on the other hand is too structured in terms of sectoral specialization to make competition among the financial institution
s almost meaningless. <#/>The Bank of Tanzania has a monopoly of financial institutions, THB, Building Construction and Allied industries, and CRDB Rural Programs. <#/>Provision of credit to industry is shared between two or three financial 
\par institutions -
 Tanganyika Development Finance Company (TDFL), Tanzania Investment Bank (TIB) and NBC (for short and medium term finance). <#/>All in all such an arrangement does not provide a conducive picture for optimum competition which could lead to the intensifica
tion of marketing. <#/>Again shortage of finance amplifies the"seller's market" situation.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 4.11 Tanzania's disposable income is low and for quite some time now "real" income has been going down, thus affecting people's consumption patterns. <#/>Demand f
or financial services such as checking accounts, credit cards, etc. has been low. <#/>For the THB for example, housing credit appears to be beyond the reach of most Tanzanians. <#/>As has been the case with other parastatal organizations in the country, s
t
ate interference in the operations of our financial organizations has been endemic, featuring in price control (control of interest rates), choice of loan beneficiaries (e.g. cooperative unions, marketing boards, etc.), and state intervention into banking
 information. <#/>This again has forestalled the application of the marketing concept.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 4.12 This Section has tried to explain why our Banks and other financial institutions have been "selling" their services rather than "marketing" them. <#/>In so doing
, however, we are not condoning this inward looking business <AmE/>behavior. <#/>In the next section we <AmE/>endeavor to justify the need for a more aggressive approach to the marketing of financial services in Tanzania.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 5.0 <h> The Need for a Marketing Orientation in our Financial Institutions  </h>
\par It is the contention of this paper that "marketing orientation" should govern all business firms including financial institutions in Tanzania if they are to grow and prosper in direct proportion to the mar
ket potentials of their industries. <#/>Four reasons explain the need for our financial institutions to transform their operations from "selling" to marketing:
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (a) The power of marketing efforts to increase sales and profitability of a company.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (b) Existence of a large market for saving and loan product offerings.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (c) The unique characteristics of financial services that require unique marketing techniques and/or approaches.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (d) The impending liberalization's of the banking and financial sector.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
5.1 One obvious reason why our financial institutions should be more marketing oriented in their operations is the positive correlation between marketing efforts and sales. <#/>Well executed marketing efforts will help a company raise its market s
hare of its industry. <#/>As the figure below shows, a company's sales potential is a function of its marketing efforts. <#/>In other words, assuming an expansible market (e.g. an unsaturated market), increase in marketing efforts will increase a company'
s sales until it reaches its highest potential. <#/>This increase will, of course depend, in part, on the marketing efforts of the competitors in the industry 
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Applied to the financial industry the message is clear: well executed marketing efforts will 
lead to an increase in a bank's or insurer's share in the "savings" and "credit" markets as well as the market of "extended" financial services.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 5.2 The "Savings Market" potential of financial institutions is large and unsaturated as evidenced by the growth of money supply (m}{\v\fs24\lang2057\sub 2}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
) which had been growing at a rate of 21% per annum form 1980-1987}{\v\fs24\lang2057\super 2}{\v\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>In 1987 money supply which as outside banks represented 35% of total money supply (m}{\v\fs24\lang2057\sub 2}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
), and this has been increasing at an annual rate of 46% from 1980 to 1987. <#/>The increase in money supply outside banks is indicative of poor performance of our banks in savings mobilization, and 
\par this is partly caused by unsatisfactory marketing efforts on the part of our banks.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 5.3 We hasten to emphasize here that othe
r factors have contributed to the increase in money supply outside financial institutions. <#/>These include frequent frauds, forgery and thefts taking place in our banks. <#/>Others are the negative interest rates and the general decline of people' s con
fidence in our banks. <#/>On the other hand, improving efficiency in financial institutions is one of the most important factors in savings mobilizations.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Speedy customer service, enough cash balances at bank branch counters, etc., should go a long way in improving the situation.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The contention that there is a remarkable increase in growth of deposits has been proven to be illusory. <#/>Whereas in nominal terms the trend seems to be good, real deposits have tremendously declined. <#/>This picture is 
clearly depicted by the Statistics in Appendix 5, 6 and 7.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 5.4 The Marketing of financial services differ from the marketing of consumer or industrial goods and services. <#/>These unique characteristics make it more compelling for banks and other fina
ncial institutions to practice marketing seriously even when they are operating in a seller's market. <#/>The following are some of the unique characteristics of financial services which complicate marketing.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (a) The intangibility, inseparability and the individualized nature of these services.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (b) The fiduciary responsibility of a banker, and
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (c) The special role of financial institutions in the economy of a country.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 5.5 Financial services cannot be seen, touched, tasted, felt or heard. <#/>Hence the customer cannot inspect it or ascertain its attributes before the actual purchase. <#/>For example, the }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 credit }{
\v\fs24\lang2057 a bank offers is represented by its acceptance of demand and time deposits and by making loans. <#/>The individual depositor actually 
buys the bank's credit by depositing cash or cheques and allowing the bank to owe him until he requests payment through his checking account or savings account. <#/>The individual borrower offers his credit to the bank when requesting a loan. <#/>If the b
ank grants the loan, it makes credit available to the borrower, usually by making a deposit to his account. <#/>Since a bank is usually selling an }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 idea, }{\v\fs24\lang2057 
not a physical product it must tell the buyer what the service will do.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 5.6 Financial services are i
nseparable in the sense that they cannot be separated from their source using middlemen. <#/>Furthermore these services are highly personalized. <#/>In many bank transactions such as those involving provision of credit a }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 client }{
\v\fs24\lang2057 relationship exists between the buyer and the seller as distinguished from the customer }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 relationship }{\v\fs24\lang2057 existing in transactions involving physical goods.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 5.7 Another factor which makes marketing especially important in financial operations is the \rdblquote fiduciary responsibility" of the b
anker. <#/>Bankers or insurers who persuade their customers to entrust personal or corporate funds to their care or to accept advice on investment incur a heavier responsibility than say the seller of clothing. <#/>This is not to say that the manufacturer
 of consumer or industrial goods is without responsibility.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 But the responsibility in these other cases is limited to the fitness of purpose, quality and value for the money of product or services concerned. <#/>It is inconvenient but seldom catastrophi
c if the milk is sour or the refrigerator breaks down. <#/>But the banker's failure to discharge his fiduciary responsibility for safeguarding customer's funds or to provide responsible advice on financial matters can bankrupt a company. <#/>All these poi
nts to the fact that marketing of financial services should be carried out by skilled marketers and preferably those with financial knowledge and ethics.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 5.8 Financial operations have a "special" role to play in the national economy for they help provid
e real resources to finance economic development. <#/>Private resource mobilization is particularly important in Tanzania as the government and parastatal sector has been saving about 70% of all savings done through financial institutions Unfortunately, a
s has already been pointed out resource mobilization by our financial institutions is far from being satisfactory. <#/>One of the reasons for this abysmal performance is the failure of these firms to market their services effectively.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 5.9 In Section one
 we pointed out about the impending liberalization of the financial sector and the resultant intensification of competition by banks and other financial institutions for the savers and borrower's shilling. <#/>We forecast intensification of inter-company 
and intra-company competition (inter-branch) in this regard.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 5.10 All in all the likely result of these changes will be the creation of a}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057  buyer's market }{\v\fs24\lang2057 
and all that goes with it in the area of marketing. <#/>This change is going to be enhanced by an in
vasion of modern banking technology including computers. <#/>Thus in the nearest future our banks' and insurer's competitive tools are likely to be found in "marketing" rather than in banking or insurance <-_}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 perse><+_per se>.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 6.0 <h> The Tools of Marketing of Financial Services </h>
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Let us now complete our paper by looking at what one might call "tools" of marketing, and how they can be used by our financial institutions to enhance operations. <#/>A clear reference is made to the THB although most o
f these examples could be applied to other financial institutions. <#/>I dare say that this subject matter is extensive and would ideally require a separate paper or two to treat it satisfactorily. <#/>Accordingly we are forced to be sketchy for fear of b
eing too long.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 6.1 As pointed out in the preceding sections, a financial institution performs three major functions. <#/>It must }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 attract }{\v\fs24\lang2057 
deposits from the "savings market" and attract borrowers from the "credit market". <#/>Furthermore a financial institution must }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 attract }{\v\fs24\lang2057 
users of extended financial services which are indirectly related with the first two functions. <#/>This function of "attracting" depositors and borrowers can be considered as a "demand creating" function which can be achieved by using 
certain marketing tools including promotion. <#/>Once the demand has been created it has to be }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 serviced }{\v\fs24\lang2057 using certain demand servicing tools including distribution.
\par <h> }{\v <#/>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 The Marketing Management Process }{\v\fs24\lang2057 </h>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 6.2 The tools of marketing can be easily 
conceptualized if we link them to a bank's or insurer's marketing management process. <#/>This process or steps in managing the marketing activities appears in Figure 5 We have pointed out in the preceding sections that success of a financial institution 
d
epends importantly on the marketer's knowledge of his markets. <#/>Accordingly the marketing management process should ideally start with this task: the task of knowing the market. <#/>It is through this knowledge that the marketer will be able to determi
n
e the market segment or segments he wants to concentrate on (market segmentation) and then design an appropriate marketing program to serve it (stage 2). <#/>This program will include both demand creating and demand serving activities. <#/>Stage three of 
this process is control, including performance evaluation.
\par <h> }{\v <#/>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 Market Analysis }{\v\fs24\lang2057 </h>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 6.3 The subject matter of market analysis is beyond the scope of this paper as it includes, among other things determination of the present and future market potenti
al or size of the markets (s) of a product(s) or service(s). <#/>Appendix 8 itemizes some the elements of the scope of a market analysis. <#/>These revolve around consumer's buyer <AmE/>behavior, market characteristics (size, location, etc.) and the Marke
ting Environment
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
6.4 Market Analysis includes market segmentation. <#/>The premise of segmentation is that markets are far from being homogenous with respect to buyer needs and responses to a given product, price, promotion and place offerings. <#/>The 
power of the concept of market segmentation is that in an age of intense competition for the mass market, individual marketers can prosper through creatively serving specific market segments whose needs are imperfectly satisfied by mass-market offerings. 
<
#/>Conversely the danger in not basing marketing programs on a careful study of the differences and similarities among market segments is average satisfaction of many needs, and thus vulnerability to competitors that design marketing programs to satisfy t
he specific needs of selected segments more effectively.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 6.5 Possible bases for segmenting markets are:
\par - geographical segmentation
\par - demographic segmentation
\par - psycho graphic segmentation
\par - volume segmentation, and
\par - benefit segmentation
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Appendix 9
 is an example of benefit segmentation utilizing only the principal benefits sought by each benefit segment for the "savings" market. <#/>THB might wish to study its mortgage loan market in bid to determine major market segments therein, evaluate these se
gments and finally select those ones it is capable of serving effectively and profitably.
\par <h> }{\v <#/>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 Tools of Market Analysis }{\v\fs24\lang2057 </h>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 6.6 In modern business management, information is a vital input in the successful management of an organization. <#/>Thus mar
keting information is important in the successful management of the marketing function. <#/>As a matter of fact its importance is to be found at every stage of the marketing management process. <#/>There is thus a need of formalizing and facilitating the 
flow of information both from internal and external sources.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 6 7 The Accounting System is the traditional way of generating an orderly flow of vital information for decision making and is part and parcel of the Marketing Information System (MIS). <#/>Fo
r example in the case of THB it can be used to collect data on deposits, mortgage loan payable and receivables and the cost of a bank's operations.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 6.8 Another tool of market analysis is marketing intelligence which should serve as the "eyes and ears" of a financial institution. <#/>The function of marketing intelligence activity is two-fold.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (a) to identify unknown environmental and competitive factors into known ones, and
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 (b) to interpret and predict how and when those factors will alter market demand.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
Thus for example THB's intelligence could have informed management well in advance the likely recommendations of the Banking Commission, future actions of the Government, moods and actions of the Bank of Tanzania in respect of interest rates 
and credit and the Government's plans in respect of policy on residential housing, the Workers and Farmers Housing Development Fund (W&FHDH) and the Special Forces Fund (SEF). <#/>Secondly, it would interpret just how and when if at all, these forces for 
change will eventually affect the ability of the bank to accomplish its marketing objectives.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 6.9 When there is need for }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 specific }{\v\fs24\lang2057 data on }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 specific }{\v\fs24\lang2057 
problems and opportunities, information which might not be easily available through the accounting or mark
eting intelligence systems can be obtained through marketing research. <#/>Marketing research is particularly necessary in determining the market characteristics of a financial institution's product offering as well s consumer attitudes about a given serv
ice, new or otherwise.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 6.10 We have a feeling that THB does not know much about its "savings" or mortgage loan markets. <#/>It should therefore carry out a study to determine, }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 inter-alia}{\v\fs24\lang2057 ,}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057  }
{\v\fs24\lang2057 market characteristics, market segments and the competitive situation of these markets. <#/>Findings of this study are bound to be invaluable as input in future planning exercise which will induce evaluation of previous operations.

\par <h> }{\v <#/>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 Developing a Marketing Plan }{\v\fs24\lang2057 </h>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 6.11 The second stage of the marketing manag
ement process is the Setting of Marketing Objectives and Developing a Marketing Plan. <#/>These objectives and plans would normally be based on the expressed needs and characteristics of target markets identified in the first stage of this process. <#/>Mo
s
t bankers see the specific marketing objectives as being those related with increasing the profitability and growth of both investment and lending as well as increasing market shares in the chosen market segments. <#/>Others are to increase commissions an
d attract funds for lending.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 6.12 A Marketing Plan describes the proposed }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 Marketing mix }{\v\fs24\lang2057 
or tools needed to achieve the defined marketing objectives. <#/>The four elements of a marketing mix are product, place, promotion and price. <#/>The unique needs a
nd characteristics of selected target markets should determine the nature and "blending" of this mix. <#/>Figure 5 below summarizes a marketing mix of a Banking organization. 
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 6.13 Product strategy involves decisions about developing the right product for the target market, where product refers to means or capacity to provide a }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 solution}{\v\fs24\lang2057  to}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057  
}{\v\fs24\lang2057 consumer problems or satisfaction of needs. <#/>A product could be new, as THB's idea of "Housing Estates" or it could be an improvement over existing products. <#/>T
he concept of the product as potential satisfactions, or problem solutions is vital to the firm 's ability to generate a flow of product offerings that truly provide real and important benefits to the consumer. <#/>It also forces the recognition that }{
\i\v\fs24\lang2057 customer service}{\v\fs24\lang2057  is}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\v\fs24\lang2057 
as important as the physical product itself in terms of potential need satisfaction. <#/>For a bank, this means, for example, that, convenience benefits created by the automatic cash dispensing and teller machines is only one of the consumer
's potential perception of the total product. <#/>In addition to convenience benefits, the consumer's imagine or actual experiences with the machine are a vital part of the product. <#/>If a consumer perceives the machine as too complex to use, }{
\i\v\fs24\lang2057 impersonal, }{\v\fs24\lang2057 or not to be trusted in making important bank transactions then the fact that the
\par hardware offers convenience value may not be enough to get market acceptance. <#/>The product for a bank is never simply the availability of credit, checking accounts, savin
gs programs, deposit boxes or machines; instead it <-/incudes> the quality of the consumer's experience each time he interacts with the bank.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 6.14 Place strategy concerns itself with the necessary actions to make the product available at the time and l
ocation desired by the target market. <#/>The idea of a channel of distributing is easily comprehended if one thinks in terms of physical products. <#/>However, the unique characteristics of banking services described in Section 5 of this paper dictate }{
\i\v\fs24\lang2057 direct }{\v\fs24\lang2057 channels of distribution.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 6.15 The distribution function of banking services has been defined as follows:
\par "any means of increasing the availability and/or convenience of a service which increases its use or the revenues from its use (either by maintaining existing users, increasing its use among existing users or attracting new users"}{\v\fs24\lang2057\super 
3}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Examples here is the Credit Card which is an innovation in the distribution of a bank's major service, credit. <#/>Another one is package offering - offering a gr
ouping of bank services to retail or corporate customers. <#/>This serves to increase the availability and convenience of several bank services. <#/>For example, a package might include advice on money market investments, the right to obtain bank credit, 
f
oreign exchange transactions in return for substantial demand deposit balances. <#/>Yet another example are automatic cash dispensers and Bank by Mail. <#/>With the Bank-by-mail service offered by some banks, the banking industry has been successful in lo
cating a middleman, the post office, to aid in facilitating the transfer of funds.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 6.16 It should be made clear, however, that the }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 location }{\v\fs24\lang2057 of banking facilities is the most important channel of distribution of banking services. <#/>Bank management may have the }{
\i\v\fs24\lang2057 right product }{\v\fs24\lang2057 for the }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 right people }{\v\fs24\lang2057 at the }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 right price, }{\v\fs24\lang2057 
but they will remain vulnerable if someone else offers the same satisfactions at a better place. <#/>Thus if THB wants to seriously compete with NBC, CRDB and the Post Office Savings Bank it m
ust reach more of its savings market either by opening more branches, operating agency schemes or by running mobile banking services. <#/>Furthermore processing of mortgage loans at the branch level will increase the availability and/ or convenience of th
i
s product, leading to enhance consumer satisfaction and increase in such loans. <#/>THB should strive to strengthen its distribution system so as to generate new accounts, increase average balances, reduce <AmE/>labor costs and income from service charge.
 <#/>Furthermore the improved channels of distributing should be capable of generating more mortgage loans and increasing customer service.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 6.17 Promotion refer to activities designed to informing customers about a bank's product offerings features and 
benefits that they can derive from consuming the product. <#/>A typical promotion-mix consists of advertising, personal selling, publicity and sales promotion. <#/>Most Tanzania banks, including THB, undertake one form or another of promotion. <#/>However
, we doubt whether these communications are well designed and executed to win identifiable target markets.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 6.18 Although uniqueness of a product, creative promotion and simple availability of the product may be important in selling a product, price beco
mes the qualifying variable in determining ultimate purchases. <#/>Unlike the first three elements of the marketing mix, pricing of banking services in Tanzania, have, until recently not been "controllable" by management as interest rates were centrally f
i
xed by the Government. <#/>Following the price decontrol announced recently by the Bank of Tanzania, and with increased competition, it is conceivable that in future, prospective depositors (and borrowers) will be dictating what rates of interest the bank
s should fix. <#/>This situation is already happening in countries such as Nigeria.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 6.19 It is also important for our bankers to realize that price includes not only money paid, but also the amount of time and physical and psychological discomfort invol
ved in buying and consuming the product. <#/>Thus a bank may find that although staying open from 9.00 a.m. until 6.00 p.m. causes administrative and operational problems and added expenses, closing at 1.00 p.m. on the other hand, causes the consumer inco
nvenience and therefore is part of the price people pay for using the bank's services. <#/>As such, the banks should carefully analyze the marginal revenue that might be generated by offering the consumer extra convenience.
\par 7.0 <h> }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Conclusions </h>
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
We would like to conclude our paper by repeating what we said in Section 5 that marketing orientation should start governing our banks and other financial institutions which have, since their creation, been selling rather than marketing their invaluable s
e
rvices. <#/>The need for this re-orientation is particularly urgent for those financial institutions whose share in the "Savings Market" is very small. <#/>The "power" of marketing to raise sales, the specific characteristics of the financial industry, it
s role and importance in the national economy, and the impending transformation of the bank market from a seller's market into a buyer's market are some of the factors which support our call for these firms to be marketing oriented.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 7.1 Accordingly all 
Managers at Branch and Corporate level should forthwith consider themselves not merely as bankers or insurers but providers of financial services. <#/>They should also start using the marketing tools to improve their operations. <#/>Marketing research is 
particularly import at this stage of the re-orientation exercise. <#/>Start collecting data and information pertaining to your markets in bid to understand them. <#/>The rest will follow.
\par }{\v <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 7.2 Organizationally the Marketing Function should be institutionalized, either as a staff function of providing management with specialist marketing services, or as a }{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 line function. <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
It should also be elevated to a position of power preferably at a directorate or top managerial level. <#/>Only in this way will our firms be effectively consumer-oriented and eventually successful in serving the "saving" and credit markets.}{
