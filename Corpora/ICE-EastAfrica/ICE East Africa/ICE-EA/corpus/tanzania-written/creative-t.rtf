\par <#/>Hanapendo watched, behind closed eyelids, fragments of her childhood passed by, she saw the forgotten faces 
of certain men, the closest, that of Joe. <#/>All these memories, instead of forming the vague, homogenous group that, when she was happy, she gaily called her life, turned into an <O/>, disorderly magma now that she was less so. <#/>Hanahela was right }{

 what was to become of them, where were they, together, heading like this? <#/>What would they become? <#/>And this bed which had been the most beautiful boat in Dar es Salaam became a drifting raft, thrown uselessly along Kunduchi Beach, and this so
 familiar room an abstract setting. <#/>He had put the notion of the future into Hanapendo's head and in doing so, seemed to have made it something impossible to share.
\par <#/>One morning, Hanapendo awoke feeling violently nauseated. <#/>Hanahela had already left as he sometimes left now without waking her. <#/>She went into the bathroom and was sick, without being too astonished.
\par <#/>Hanapendo was pregnant. <#/>She was at last, after a long combat, caught and cornered by life. <#/>A world where irresponsibili
ty was punished. <#/>Hanahela loved her and would be ready to play the prospective father according to the way she presented the news. <#/>If she told him: something delightful has happened to us, he would take the expected child as a blessing, that she k
new.
\par <#/>But she did not have the right. <#/>Because this child would take away her freedom definitely, and for that reason, would not make her happy. <#/>And too, she knew it she had disappointed Hanahela and had led him to a stage in their love where ever
ything seems as proof of his love. <#/>And he would be ready to take as such that accident kindly. <#/>She loved him too much she did not want this baby }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  , she only wanted him.
\par <#/>When Hanahela came home, she told him of her troubles. <#/>He grew slightly pale, then took her in his arms. <#/>He talked in a fanciful voice and she felt herself tighten her jaws stupidly.
\par <#/>'Are you sure you don't want it?'
\par <#/>'I only want you,' she said.
\par <#/>She did not discuss the material difficulties, she was
 afraid of humiliating him. <#/>She did not want to burden him with it. <#/>This was not the time to have daydreams of a little Hanahela. <#/>It was the time to open one's eyes to compare the size of the rented room with that of a crib.
\par <#/>'We might try t
o get married and all that....... we could move' 'Where would we go? <#/>' she asked. <#/>'And I think that a child ties one down terribly, you know. <#/>You would <-_came><+_come> home to find me fed up, in a bad humour ... it would be......'
\par <#/>The next day at eight }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>orth}{\fs24\lang2057 
 O'clock she telephoned Hanahela, his voice sounded tired, worried, she did not have the courage to speak of her fright. <#/>Yet, at that moment if he had asked her, she might have decided to keep the baby. <#/>But she fel
t helpless and she suddenly yearned for some sort of protection. <#/>She automatically thought of Joe Michuzimingi, Joe whom she had wiped out of her memory like an uncomfortable remorse, like a name that could still make Hanahela suffer. <#/>In a flash, 
she knew that she was going to ask him for help, that no one could stop her, that he was the only human being capable of doing something to end this nightmare.
\par <#/>Joe Michuzimingi, as his name explains was a successful businessman, a tycoon on }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  his
 own right with big bank accounts in the country and abroad. <#/>Hanapendo telephoned him, she dialled the familiar office number, greeted the switchboard operator. <#/>He was there, she had a curious feeling when she heard his voice and it took a while f
or her to recover her breath.
\par <#/>'Joe' she said, 'I would like to see you, I'm in trouble'. <#/>'I'll send the car for you in an hour,' he replied calmly. <#/>'Is that all right? <#/>' 'Oh yes, Yes, she responded, 'in an hour'. <#/>She waited for him to ha
ng up and then, as he did not, she remembered his unfailing courtesy, and put down the receiver. <#/>She dressed hurriedly, and had to wait for three-quarters of an hour afterwards, the chauffeur greeted her joyfully and, with a feeling of immense relief,
 she sat down on the familiar seat.
\par <#/>When at Joe's house, she glanced about the room, remarked in a loud voice that nothing had changed. <#/>Not even himself, and she thought with panic that he perhaps imagined that she had returned to him. <#/>She began
 to talk so fast that he had to ask her to repeat her words.
\par <#/>'Joe, I'm expecting a baby, I don't want to keep it, I must see a doctor for an abortion, I have no money.
\par <#/>'Are you sure that you don't want to keep it?'
\par <#/>'I can't afford to, we can't afford to,' she answered, blushing.
\par <#/>'You're absolutely certain that it's not only a question of money?
\par <#/>'Absolutely certain,' she said.
\par <#/>Joe got up, took several steps about the room, then turning, he began to laugh sadly.
\par <#/>'You don't want to have anything of your own, do you? <#/>Neither a husband, nor a child nor a home ... really nothing. <#/>It's very strange.
\par <#/>Joe sat down at his desk, wrote a cheque. <#/>He handed it to her she had a lump in her throat, }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar/connection}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 she would
 have liked to cry out for him not to be so kind, so comforting, not to make her shed the tears that filled her eyes. <#/>Tears of relief, bitterness and melancholy.
\par <#/>'You know I'm still waiting for you,' said Joe. <#/>I'm horribly bored without you. <#/>It's not very tactful to tell you so today, but we see so little of each other?
\par <#/>He gave a small, forced laugh that put an end to her thoughts. <#/>She jumped up, 'thank you' and hurried to the door. <#/>'I don't want the money,' said Hanahela. <#/>'H
ave you thought for a moment of what that man thinks of me? <#/>Does he take me for a pimp? <#/>I take this woman from him and I make him pay for my blunders? <#/>'Hanahela.... <#/>' 'It's too much, far too much. <#/>I'm not a model of morality, but there

\par <#/>It seemed as though the fact of being able to sort out one's feelings automatically all their lives led
 to this conflict, while chats and liars could remain wildly romantic all their lives. <#/>Hanapendo loved Hanahela, but cared for Joe Michuzimingi, Hanahela made her happy and she did not make Joe unhappy.
\par <#/>As she valued both men, she was not sufficien
tly interested in herself to be ashamed of allowing herself to be shared by both. <#/>Her total lack of self-sufficiency made her ruthless, and it was quite by chance that she discovered that she could suffer.

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>I had just become the dean of the
 Faculty of Applied Sciences at the University of Bongoland. <#/>I was about to interview and counsel one of the lecturers who had remained without promotion for ten <-/eyars>. <#/>This man also happened to be my brother-in-law.
\par <#/>I went through the man's file. <#/>Since 1983 the man had not applied for further education, had not written or presented any papers and had not even complained about a promotion.
\par <#/>The man always seemed to be <-/absent minded>. <#/>He dressed simply and hardly ever shaved.
\par <#/>His wife, my sister, had left him in 1989, complaining that her husband was a bigamist and that his two wives were her and his work. <#/>She had given him an ultimatum; either to choose work or her and she had lost. <#/>He was 
a workaholic, she had said.
\par <#/>So if he was a workaholic, why had he not been promoted?
\par <#/>His students conceded that he excelled in his subject but that he was rather too fast. <#/>The material he was teaching was apparently too easy for him.
\par <#/>Other lecturers had a low opinion of him. <#/>Some said he was too untidy. <#/>Others said he was anti-social. <#/>Yet others thought he was a}{\i\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 Mirembe }{\fs24\lang2057 
case, a nut. <#/>The verdict was unanimous, he was different.
\par <#/>He spent a disproportionate amount of his time in his office or the science labs doing diagrams, calculations, experiments and reading the latest science materials. <#/>He hardly had any social life at all.
\par <#/>There was a}{\b\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 knock on the door and Mr. Kilingwa came in. <#/>He was, as usual untidy but his eyes looked bright and <-/exited>.
\par <#/>"Come in Mr. Kilingwa," I said trying to be indifferent to what had transpired between him and my sister, "I won't keep you for}{\i\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 long.\rdblquote 
\par <#/>"Well, your summons <-_were><+_was> very timely," he said cheerfully, "I was about to come and see you about a matter of great importance. <#/>I'm happy now that you are Dean... <#/>" I gently cut him short.
\par <#/>"I wanted to talk to you about your career. <#/>Everybody else is scrambling up the ladder towards the}{\b\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 peak of the academic profession. <#/>Why are you not? <#/>" I asked him carefully.
\par <#/>Kilingwa looked at me straight in the eye, and his voice was very earnest as he said, "I have no time to chase titles. <#/>I do the science work because I love it. <#/>It's my life.
 <#/>I live for it. <#/>It's not just a matter of making a living, I am very interested in my work. <#/>In fact I have just come up with an idea and framework for a hydrogen engine and that's what I had planned to come and see you about.\rdblquote 
\par <#/>"How does thi
s hydrogen engine work? <#/>" I asked patronizingly. <#/>I knew that it was another crank idea. <#/>I had had the same idealism when I graduated as an engineer. <#/>To design, to invent, to innovate and to build. <#/>To develop this beloved country by usi
ng this priceless asset, brains.
\par <#/>The constraints and <-/obstackles> that I had come across had erased all my ambitions. <#/>I had to face the harsh 'reality' that things are <-/mad> in Europe, America and Japan. <#/>We are but consumers, a market. <#/>O
ur leaders unwittingly discouraged us, facilities were lacking, funds were short and even life itself at the campus had basic problems. <#/>Circumstances were such that technology and inventiveness just couldn't thrive.
\par <#/>And here was Kilingwa telling me the details of an invention. <#/>I wanted to laugh aloud but checked myself. <#/>I had failed in my dreams years ago and I had joined the rat-race in the chase for titles and <ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 marapurupu. <#/>}{
\fs24\lang2057 Here I had some success, I was Dean, wasn't I? <#/>... And now I had my eye on the Vice-Chancellorship. <#/>All that a man needed on this planet was money and enough power to protect one's interests, not silly scientific ideas.
\par <#/>Kilingwa said, he had found conditions of temperature, pressure and catalysis under which water could be split into hydrogen and oxygen using very small quantities of electrical energy.
\par <#/>Effectively this meant an engine that ran on water. <#/>He was asking for funds to develop the project and he was trying to explain the economics...
\par <#/>Environmentally and economically this would be a miracle, I thought, but what a dream!
\par <#/>I said, "I'm sorry, Mr. Kilingwa, I called you to this office for a different purpose and now we are discussing something else. <#/>I have to tell you very frankly that we have no funds to buy }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057 
 equipment and materials that you require for your research, At any rate I think it's a waste of time. <#/>Europeans would have thought of it if it were at all possible.\rdblquote 
\par <#/>I dismissed him curtly and immediately
 regretted my behaviour when I saw the very pained and disappointed expression on his face. <#/>I ignored the feeling. <#/>A boss had to be tough; and if I entertained all the 'nuts' that the campus had, I'd go mad myself. <#/>Thereafter I noticed that Ki
lingwa had become very friendly with Dr. Samuel Carter, an expatriate lecturer, from the United Republics of America, (URA). <#/>I felt sorry for Carter for having to put up with a queer like Kilingwa.
\par <#/>Six months later Kilingwa handed in his resignation. <#/>The faculty staff said "good-riddance! <#/>" The man had been abnormal.
\par <#/>We did not hear from Kilingwa for another two years, and we were about to forget him, when he <-_brought><+_sent> me a card saying that he was working for General Engines Company, a multinational based in the URA at their head office in New York.

\par <#/>He said he was coming for a holiday and wanted me to meet him at Bandar International Airport. <#/>He stated the expected date and time of arrival and wrote things that I interpreted as saying he also wanted my sister at the airport to meet him.

\par <#/>I understood. <#/>Kilingwa had no close friends, so I shouldered the burden of collecting him}{\b\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 at the airport. <#/>Checking with the airlines, I realized that the airline with a plane ar
riving on the stipulated date would land at half past ten in the morning, not ten o'clock sharp as stated in the card.
\par <#/>Just to be on the safe side, me and my sister were there by a quarter to ten on the day he was to arrive.
\par <#/>At exactly ten o'clock,
 a Hawker Siddeley Executive jet touched down at the airport and taxied to the terminal building. <#/>We were about to ignore the plane, waiting for the scheduled commercial airliner at 10:30, when the hustle and bustle around the jet drew our attention. 
<#/>A black limousine bearing the flag of the United Republic of America drew up about twenty meters from the plane. <#/>If the Ambassador of URA himself was here to receive the guest then it must be a big fish.
\par <#/>Two <ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 Wazangu}{\fs24\lang2057  formed a bodyguard as th
e blackman between them walked towards the ambassador after disembarking from the plane. <#/>They shook hands warmly and it was then that we recognized Kilingwa. <#/>He looked younger and healthier, almost handsome. <#/><-/May be> that's how my sister had
 seen him those many years ago. <#/>We were dumb-struck.
\par <#/>My sister asked, "Why are they guarding him like that?\rdblquote 
\par <#/>A man besides us said," That man heads the Research Team for Hydrogen Engines in the URA. <#/>That is the engine of the future when foss
il fuels run out. <#/>He is reputed to be one of the greatest scientists in the world and is lined up for the Nobel Prize...\rdblquote 
\par <#/>A series of emotions overtook me in quick succession. <#/>Pride, that Bongoland could have spawned so great a brain. <#/>Sorrow, that under the circumstances, brain drain had to happen. <#/>Shame, that I was party to this particular loss. <#/>And envy
. <#/>Had I persisted in the dreams of my youth, would I not have come to this? <#/>Being received like a president?
\par <#/>My sister was speaking, In a way, I still love him. <#/>You know, at least I did not lose him to another woman, I lost him to his work.\rdblquote

\par <#/>The grand wedding took place at St. Joseph's Cathedral between Sir <-/Humphery>, forty-six, <-_to><+_and> Pamella, twenty-six and a secretary to Legal Advising Corporation (LAC). <#/>They flew to Seychelles for two <-_weeks><weeks'> honeymoon.

\par <#/>Two months <-/passed-by> and nothing changed. <#/>Pamella always complained urging her husband to try the with }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>line missing}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057

\par <#/>He sent his brother's son to a boarding school. <#/>Then he substituted all houseboys to }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
 housegirls. <#/>He took out his pistol, loaded it and warned Pamella that from that day on, whenever he hears she's with a man}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
, he would shoot both of them instantly. <#/>He swore to that! <#/>Her holiday tours were also <-/concelled>. <#/>Even her personal doctor was changed and she was no longer to move alone; even to salons! <#/>The impotent husband was really jealous!

\par <#/>At the end of it, something happened. <#/>Gado was temporarily employed in LAC. <#/>He had just finished form four and lived with his brother - Maliki - in a house opposite to Humphrey's. <#/>He requested to do temporary work until results were out.

\par <#/>A two weeks }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  before Christmas, Gado was called by Pamella. <#/>She gave him a large envelope.
\par <#/>"What's it for?" <#/>"Find something for <-/X-mas>. <#/>And please put it in your pocket! <#/>" He was very lucky for hardly had he put it in <-_the><+_his> pocket when the door was opened and Hump

 Gado we can go to Kilimanjaro for tea? <#/>" And it became habitual.
\par <#/>On the evening of the same day, Humphrey visited Maliki. <#/>The latter was preparing for his <-_Christians><+_Christmas> Moshi trip. <#/>After some talks, Humphrey asked for Gado. <#/>He came and Maliki <O/> exited.
\par <#/>"Gado, I want you to help me something }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  but before I tell you, promise that you won't tell anybody even Maliki! <#/>" Humphrey asked.
\par <#/>After some hesitations, Gado promised. <#/>Humphrey told him that he wanted to hire him to keep an eye on his wife. <#/>He'll pay him tremendously }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\b\fs24\lang2057 /}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 tense}{\fs24\lang2057 
! <#/>Gado couldn't understand what was wrong with this rich couple. <#/>He recalled the previous morning when Pamella gave him twenty thousand shillings for nothing important. <#/>The curiosity of exhuming the hidden life of them }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 
<&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 , prompted him to accept the duty he was asked.

pay would be eight thousand per month!
\par <#/>A week later Pamella called Gado. <#/>She gave him ten thousands more! <#/>"Go and buy a card for your girlfriend," she said. <#/>"I don't have a girlfriend," Gado replied. <#/>"Then I'm your girl. <#/>Look, I hav

\par <#/>"I'll invite you in for X-mas dinner. <#/>Now leave! <#/>" Gado understood and left instantly. <#/>The parcel had a very expensive pair of English <-_shoe><+_shoes>. <#/>Al
so there was a very beautiful Christmas card. <#/>She'd written: Gado truly you mean a lot to me. <#/>I love you. <#/>With all my love - Pamella!
\par <#/>The telephone rang at six in the evening. <#/>"What are you doing Gado. <#/>Pamella had just reminded me that you're all alone there, why can't you come and kill the night with us?\rdblquote 
\par <#/>Gado had been there for two hours. <#/>He just drank soda. <#/>Humphrey kept drinking heavily his}{\i\fs24\lang2057  Scotch Whisky}{\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>At eight they ate the X-mas dinner. <#/>Gado remembered the

\par <#/>But it didn't come out }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057  until the Easter of the fifth year. <#/>Maliki decided to send Gado to deliver some money to their f

\par <#/>She told Humphrey about her medical check up. <#/>While he thought it over, he visited Maliki. <#/>Fortunately, he was told about Gado's planned trip. <#/>"When? <#/>" He was more than excited. <#/>"<-_I',><+_I'm> still looking for his fare.

\par <#/>"What a phantom is this, <-/blood> fool! <#/>" He said throwing it down and running to their room. <#/>Pamella rushed and collected the crying baby. <#/>When she stood up, he was in the doorway gun in hand pointing at Pamella's head!

\par <#/>Florah recoiled at the vehemence in her adversary's voice and <-/instictively> <-/sauggled> young Francis even closer to her in a gesture that could have been interpreted in two ways. <#/>She was ei

\par <#/>This <-_afternoon><+_afternoon\rquote s> verbal assault was a culmination of Florah's efforts during the past seven days to divest herself of the burden }{\v\fs24\lang2057 <-_>of the burden<-/> }{\fs24\lang2057

\par <#/>Although she had resumed living with her sister Waridi ever since }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  affair with Dominic Lushato had broken up, she was nevertheless not a suitable replacement to }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{
\fs24\lang2057  Dominic, in so numerous aspects as Florah was now realising the hard way. <#/>To cap it all Francis was now like an anchor, restricting her from freely venturing into uncharted waters, as she would have wished, hence her decision to se
nd him to his father and her erstwhile lover <-/Domini> Lushato.
\par <#/>The break-up of her affair with Dominic, whom they had <-_began><+_begun> staying together }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  soon after she became heavy with his child, was due to her failure to note that behi
nd his rather timid exterior, Dominic was actually a man of immense inner-strength. <#/><-/Strong willed>, and basically of unassailable moral character, Dominic shunned pretentiousness.
\par <#/>But there are always two sides to a coin. <#/>His virtuosity coul
d ironically <-_he><+_be> said to have been the cause of many of the numerous collisions with some people close to him who misread the simplicity in his general outlook and <-/intrepreted> it as a sign characteristic of a weakling.
\par <#/>Before they had met,
 Dominic had spent a frustrating twelve years nursing successive heartaches after repeatedly being jilted by members of the 'fair' sex, whose main preoccupation in life, Dominic concluded, was to deliberately provoke men, hence arousing attention to thems
elves and once this deed was accomplished, they suddenly became coy and slippery and generally played hard to get, most probably relishing in the frustration this caused to the hitherto 'sleeping tigers' they had goaded into <-/consiocusness>.
\par <#/>To someone as straight (straight (or is it square? <#/>) as Dominic it was not <-/suprising> that he should become so devoted to the first woman who appeared to accept him <-/wholeheatedly>, as Florah initially appeared to be.
\par <#/>Florah on her part, had her reason
s for being the <-/exeption> to the 'code' governing the conduct of women in their general interplay with men. <#/>At the time she managed to catch the attention of <-/Dominc>, she was you could say, somewhat <-/desparate>. <#/>Waridi, whom she had paid a
 
<-/suprise> visit after finishing her primary education tired with the same old, old misconception, that the city is a goldmine of some kind, where <-_wealthy><+_wealth> can be mined with impunity; had already <-_became><+_become> tired of her unproductiv
e presence at her place.
\par <#/>She had already given notice that come the end of the month she would give her a one-way ticket back to Bogwe. <#/>This was a notion she so dreaded, that she took the first opportunity that came her way to ensure that she stayed
 in Mwambao, namely, moving over to stay in with the first man who, however clumsily, invited her to do so. <#/>The <-_men><+_man> happened to be <-/non> other than Dominic Lushato.
\par <#/>After six months of their going together, Florah had conceived and she was immensely <-/exhilirated> by this event, as it defined in no uncertain terms the setting of her relationship with Dominic and made her position rather more secure.
\par <#/>Nine months afterwards Florah had given birth to a bouncing baby boy they named Francis.
\par <#/>The birth of Francis marked a significant turning point in their <-/notso> formal relationship so far. <#/>From the day Francis was born, it appeared that Domi
nic had ceased to exist insofar as Florah was concerned. <#/>The <-/new born> became the focal point of her attention and she was so obsessed in taking care of his up-bringing, that she seemed to forget that there was another 'baby' craving for her attent
ion.
\par <#/>This brought Dominic practically back to the position he had been }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_in>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 
before living with Florah which was now aggravated because of her permanent presence, which made it extremely difficult for Dominic to play 'bishop' and count the <-/refters> 
in their ceiling while sleeping in the spare-bed as the three of them could not share the matrimonial bed and the toss as to who would share it with Florah <-/natuarally> went to Francis.
\par <#/>This brought a strain in their marital relationship, after the e
xpiry of the traditional six weeks of abstinence, as unlike the time prior to <-_Francis><+_Francis'> birth, Dominic had always to take the initiative and move to bed. <#/>This put in an element of artificiality in their relations unlike the previous time
 where cohabitation occurred naturally and without the <-/premediation> that the <-/movments> to and <-_for><+_from> their beds entailed.
\par <#/>But what was perhaps more serious than the to and fro movement was the fact that Florah tried to use the relations 
as a bargaining chip in case she needed something Dominic was reluctant to buy her, or as a weapon whenever she felt she had been mistreated, (never mind whether by accident or deliberately).
\par <#/>A gulf had now developed between them which kept on widening
 whenever they had misunderstandings. <#/>Eventually there came a night when Florah had used her bargain-chip cum weapon, once too often, and Dominic had decided that enough was enough and the ensuing fracas, led to their tearful separation (on Flora's pa
rt at least).
\par <#/>Unknown to Florah, her weapon had inevitably worked against her as it had forced Dominic to look beyond the four walls of their home and that is where Stella came into the picture. <#/>Her background was not dissimilar to Florah so, she ac
cepted with both hands and curtsy the opportunity to move in and stay with Dominic when his relationship with Florah had flopped, and she had gone back to her sister's place in the hope that Dominic would follow, cap in hand, begging for her return. <#/>T
hat was a grave miscalculation that sealed the fate of their then wavering relations. <#/>Stella had then moved in to fill the void she had created.
\par <#/>After one year of spinstership Florah had made the decision to dump Francis at Dominic's place, so that she could be free again to look for greener pastures.</I>

ap. <#/>Three other members were nabbed in a police swoop and were jailed for criminal offences, including murder. <#/>Wembe, the gang leader, and Patasi survived.
\par <#/>Wembe, son of a peasant, did not manage to stay in his village to till the land. <#/>He 
went to the city to seek employment. <#/>He got none. <#/>In fact even his relative Ilambo could no longer accommodate Wembe. <#/>As Ilambo was a bachelor, he left nothing for Wembe to eat at home. <#/>Sometimes Ilambo came late during the night with his 
girl friend, who had a loose tongue, probably she was drunk. <#/>Ilambo would knock at the door jabbering humiliating words.
\par <#/>"<ea/>Uchungu, <ea/>Uchunguu! <#/>"Why are you locking yourself into my room as if it were yours. <#/>Open it up or I will kick it open and cut off your long ear lobes".
\par <#/>His girl friend would add salt to injury. <#/>"He can't make us unhappy. <#/>He is so ugly, this relative of yours, his ears are as long as the bat's. <#/>If you don't throw him out of this room you will cease to be my husband".
\par <#/>So one night Wembe was thrown out into the cold and slept in the open, the moon gazing at him.
\par <#/>That was how he joined the thieves, the smugglers and the <ea/>bhang <-/somokers> and Patasi Makari.
\par <#/>They smoked marijuana. <#/>It
 made them blissful. <#/>They believed the dried, potent leaves only made sham smokers crazy. <#/>Not them. <#/>They were committed in their missions. <#/>They gathered at a derelict building and <-_pray><+_prayed> for marijuana.
\par <#/>"<ea_><X_>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 Tupe nguvu. Tuzingue}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>" They would operate with alacrity, mercilessness and an <-/unparralleled> mastery. <#/>Wembe was cleverer in his business whenever he smoked marijuana! <#/>He worked tirelessly. <#/>He had an eagle's eye. <#/>He could spot money stashed int
o their owners' pockets or bags or purses and successfully scheme how to take it. <#/>His fingers were money detectors. <#/>They were magnets. <#/>Money could not help being attracted by their magnetic field.
\par <#/>But this was one of }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057 
 lean days when all passengers seemed to be on strike not to carry money other than their fares. <#/>Wembe had smoked the whole stick of the powerful, yellowish grade of <ea/>bhang. <#/>Yet he got no money. <#/>Not even a shilling. <#/>and he was feeling 
hungry. <#/>Whenever he smoked the thing, they called <ea/>nguvu, power, he <-_overeat><overate>.
\par <#/>He could eat three plates full of rice. <#/>Now he had no money even to buy a single plate of rice with. <#/>He had taken a cup of tea and four buns mashed
 in a small bowl of hot beans. <#/>He got his breakfast on credit from his neighbour who ran a rickety restaurant.
\par <#/>Now as marijuana had incensed his hunger and whetted his thirst, he was determined to run with everything valuable, even a basket of cassava, potatoes or oranges. <#/>He would cook cassava or potatoes at a friend's place. <#/>Wembe had no stove at }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  his room at a clumsy house. <#/>He wondered what had happened that he was so <-_unluck><+_unlucky> to get money from the people at <-/mo
nth-end>. <#/>It was the time when his landlord would demand the rent. <#/>Unfortunately, not even Patasi had some money to lend Wembe. <#/>In fact, Patasi too was alarmed where to get money. <#/>Fears to go home were not a problem for them. <#/>They woul
d just board a bus and nobody would demand fare for them.
\par <#/>So Wembe felt at a man's bag. <#/>There were soft and hard objects. <#/>Maybe there were loaves of bread and new shoes. <#/>He would munch the bread and sell the shoes. <#/>Maybe they were the ma
n's shoes or his wife's. <#/>He was not pretty sure but he believed the elderly man had something valuable <-_into><+_in> his bag. <#/>Wembe saw another advantage. <#/>The man could not run quickly as the age was catching }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_up>}{

\par <#/>He pulled the bag out of the man's hand and ran away. <#/>Patasi was quick to notice what had taken place. <#/>He also sprinted, following his colleague. <#/>The man shouted <ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 mwizi, <ea/>mwizi}{\fs24\lang2057 
 thief, but Wembe and his friend were already swallowed by the darkness as they headed towards a dark alley.
\par <#/>Wembe opened the bag. <#/>His colleague also struggled to empty the loot. <#/>Wembe could not tolerate that as he was the key player to }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  the operation. <#/>He grabbed his companion by the scruff }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>idiom}{\fs24\lang2057  and threw him on the ground.

 members to show their prowess. <#/>That was partly why Wembe became their boss. <#/>He won many matches. <#/>So Patasi had once again to test Wembe's rough skills. <#/>When Pata
si picked himself up, Wembe's hands were into the bag, groping for its contents. <#/>Patasi came. <#/>He shoved his hands too. <#/>Wembe felt a sharp object piercing his finger tip. <#/>He thought Patasi had come with a pin to pinch him. <#/>Before he too
k his finger out of the thing, it <-_squirt><+_squirted> something. <#/>He believed that was the work of Patasi. <#/>What was he holding equipped with }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
? <#/>He had to teach him a lesson, this poor son of a peasant. <#/>He grabbed Patasi as his hands were rummaging }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
 the bag and threw him violently into the gutter he knew so well. <#/>Patasi yelled as a sharp, big thing impaled him. <#/>It was a metal object. <#/>Patasi felt like dying. <#/>Wembe cursed. <#/>He went back to his bag. <#/>He f
elt <-/dizy>, his hand limp. <#/>His legs were powerless. <#/>He could not see anything. <#/>Not even the moon, the neon lamps burning from afar.
\par <#/>The following morning passengers found Patasi dead in the gutter. <#/>Wembe was also dead beside the stolen bag. <#/>He died of }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Buga Street ah! <#/>Buga Street: that is the world I know, the world I was born into. <#/>It was a kind of <unknown/>Eloff - a hive of activity. <#/>Groups of children playing excitedly: girls playing in }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>sense
}{\fs24\lang2057  or skipping and barefoot boys kicking a flat plastic ball on the rough surface.
\par <#/>Shoppers, other children darting to and from Emakuleni. <#/>Youngsters rushing to or strolling back from the cinemas. <#/>Crowds of workers - <-/grim faced>, <-/strong limbed> men and women in overalls.
\par <#/>The first recollection that comes to mind is that of Enkomeni, a <afr/>shebeen diagonally o
pposite our house which dealt in homebrewed liquor; <afr/>Skopdonner, that's what they called it. <#/>The place was always buzzing with voices especially towards the evenings when business reached the peak.
\par <#/>To my chaste mind the stra
nge men and women who patronised the place were a real wonder. <#/>They were not from anywhere around, for I knew none of them. <#/>On their way home they walked as if on water and fell down like cut trees. <#/>Some would collapse right in the middle of t
he street and lie there for endless <-_ours><+_hours> - there were not more than two cars on Buga.
\par <#/>In the street the drunks spoke in a strange way and seemed totally oblivious to those outside their circle. <#/>They would bare their parts and urinate right in front of our eyes. <#/>Ma did not approve of my seeing the goings-on of the weird place.

\par <#/>Whenever she found me standing at the gate fixed on Enkomeni, she would immediately find something for me to do inside the house. <#/>Sometimes, policemen i
n their <slang/>nylons (that is how their cars were called then) would raid the place and arrest people.
\par <#/>At such times, the whole street would come out to witness excitedly; these were usually on Saturdays when most people were resting at home.
\par <#/>As soon as I was big enough, I began to venture out into the street; to play. <#/>We played cars, marbles and top and other <-_boys><+_boys'> games. <#/>The girls played houses, skipping and <ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 bati}{\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>Sometimes we came together for a game of <ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 dimeke}{\fs24\lang2057  of <ea_>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 tikkie na topi}{\i\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>}{\fs24\lang2057  - boys against girls.
\par <#/>Playing outside was a dangerous affair for it exposed you to a ubiquitous township menace - the bully. <#/>Bullies are usually bigger, stronger and considerably rougher boys. <#/>It seemed their busines
s was to examine studiously the innocent for weaknesses, exploiting which they proceeded to make life extremely uncomfortable for them.
\par <#/>Just as small boys do to helpless ants; like sticking pins to their behinds. <#/>You would be playing happily, compl
etely lost in wonderland, when pham! <#/>- a bully showed up in your midst. <#/>For a small boy nothing is as scary as this unexpected appearance of a bully's face with its friends }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  eyes and cruel smile.

\par <#/>In this circumstance you had to scamper for your dear life, and thus was lost many a valued boy. <#/>If you were not lucky enough to escape in time, you got a cruel beating.
\par <#/>It was a cat and mouse affair. <#/>In our case however, it had to end. <#/>We were growing bigger. <#/>It was Buti 
who took charge of this. <#/>Buti was a boy - three years older - who lived about five houses up from ours. <#/>In our group he was by far the strongest built and had already played up the street and beyond.
\par <#/>He knew the enemy and the enemy knew him wel
l. <#/>He was simply tired of being led and bullied. <#/>So he just declared his territory and set his army to defend it. <#/>We were not a bad army at all. <#/>We never went to other areas to harass and loot; we kept to ours - guarding our grounds and pr
otecting members.
\par <#/>Buti knew many things. <#/>He was already a <-/movie goer>. <#/>He told us }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
 karate, cowboy and gladiator films. <#/>Soon we also began to attend shows. <#/>Even our play changed. <#/>Now we played <-_that><+_what> we saw in the
 films, especially war. <#/>Serge - this is what we called him - organised us and gave us names from the films. <#/>He also taught us to make catapults and other weapons.
\par <#/>Soon our territory was free of intruders. <#/>Whenever an enemy blundered into our terrain, the first to spot him would whistle the signal and in no time we would be upon him.
\par <#/>When errands demanded that one venture into enemy country, others gave necessary protection. <#/>It was one for all and all for one. <#/>This was imperative 
for as soon as our rivals were beaten out, they resorted to cowardly measures; like ambushing our members individually.
\par <#/>This was unavoidable as elders would not understand our predicaments. <#/>They would send you after a useless thing right into enemy
 territory and not give you enough chance to gather your men; like the day when I was cornered by the boys up the street.
\par <#/>It was in the evening and I was fixing my car outside when my father called me in:
\par "Vusi!\rdblquote 
\par <#/>"<ea/>Baba," I replied a little annoyed, though I could not show it.
\par <#/>"Come," he commanded.
\par <#/>The first thing after work, <ea/>Baba soothed his big feet in a metal basin steaming with hot water. <#/>Presently this is what he was doing seated on a <-/bankstoel> next to the black stove.
\par <#/>"Go up the street to Gumede and tell him to give you that herb.\rdblquote 
\par <#/>The name Gumede immediately sent shivers down my spine. <#/>I could not grasp anything beyond it. <#/><ea/>Baba Gumede! <#/>That was enemy land. <#/>His son Punkie was the boss of our
 arch-rivals. <#/>Just the previous day, we had licked his 'trusted' and at this time they would be hanging around not far from the house enjoying }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  evening palaver.
\par <#/>"You say I should go to <ea/>Baba Gumede's house, <ea/>Baba? <#/>I ventured <-/ackwardly>.
\par <#/>"Dammit! <#/>What's wrong with your ears? <#/>Can't you hear properly? <#/>I said run up to Gumede and get me my medicine! <#/>" He roared back and as I was starting out added:
\par "And please, I expect no delay. <#/>I want that medicine NOW. <#/>You understand? <#/>" It was as if he knew my difficulty.
\par <#/>"Yes, <ea/>Baba," I replied intimidated.
\par <#/>As I walked up the street many thoughts raced confusedly through my mind. <#/>It being a Wednesday, all members of our gang had gone to the Lib
erty Cinema. <#/>I still remember very well. <#/>The Pitiless Three was showing and I could not go for one chore or another.
\par <#/>I had no alternative but to go alone. <#/>I dared not disobey my father's commands. <#/>Walking numbly towards certain capture, I deplored the insensitiveness of elders to our plight.
\par <#/>Looking over my shoulder, I thought I saw <ea/>Baba's face looking sternly in my direction. <#/>He sure was intent on seeing me to the gallows. <#/>I hurried on hoping for a miracle. <#/>I even mumbled a short prayer.
\par <#/>"Hey, look what we have in our hands for supper, gents. <#/>" It was our victim, I knew his voice. <#/>I had stumbled right into them. <#/>I walked on hoping it was just a dream or something.
\par <#/>"Ya, just where do you think you are going, heh? <#/>" There was an unexpected shove from behind. <#/>It got me reeling. <#/>When I looked up, I was completely encircled. <#/>There were six of them, with Punkie in command.
\par <#/>He stood out distinct; <-/well built> and proportional. <#/>His head was clean shaven and a shiny ring dangled from his ear. <#/>In his Scotford T-shirt, Greenline shorts and Tenderfoot sneakers; he was the typical look of a <ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 
tsotsi}{\fs24\lang2057  - the terror of many. <#/>Next to him was: Zandie, the one we had fixed. <#/>The others were just there waiting for orders.
\par <#/>"So this is one of them, neh? <#/>" Punkie said advancing slowly. <#/>The others were just watching. <#/>It was beginning to darken over the township and the evening crowds had already thinned out. <#/>There was no other way out. <#/>I had to fight.

\par <#/>"Yaa, I'm one of them. <#/>So? <#/>" I heard myself saying, more from cheek.
\par <#/>"Plus, he is stubborn too. <#/>Let's beat him up. <#/>" <-_Game><+_came> Zandie's voice. <#/>All the time I was looking right into Punkie's eyes, moving backwards in a circle.
\par <#/>"Don't be a coward Let's go for a fair fight. <#/>" I heard myself saying again.
\par <#/>"Okay with me, if that's what you want, sonny," He said it coolly, indicating to his men to widen up the circle. <#/>His fists were already in the air and he smacked of <-/over confidence>. <#/>I stood my ground and egged him defiantly.
\par <#/>"Come. <#/>" This angered him and blinded him to any possibilities of danger. <#/>He did not stop t
o think. <#/>He came straight, I was waiting for him. <#/>The next thing he was flat on the ground, never having seen what hit him. <#/>It was a <-/patrek> shot. <#/>And as he checked out his jaw, I was towering over him:
\par "You want some more?\rdblquote 
\par <#/>"You win," he replied weakly. <#/>That is how the truce was won on Buga Street.<#/I>

\par <#/>I did not invite her. <#/>However to say }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24  the truth I was not opposed to her <-/tresspassing> in the house. <#/>I was curious, for I wanted to know how this mouse had survived as a species when l

n I }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24  which has water shows no traces of life.
\par <#/>With Julie, the departed cat, it was not long before a communication system was established. <#/>It was both ways. <#/>She gave notice when she was hungry. <#/>It also came to know my minimum demand
s, one of which was where to deposit the food and water her system had rejected. <#/>And Julie had an obsession about keeping herself clean. <#/>When not sleeping or eating she would be <-_hicking><+_licking> her fur that it would be both shining and clea

\par <#/>I found that Belmora was a professional in certain things. <#/>Julie would never lick her <-_sauser><+_saucer> clean and there would be crumbs lying about the floor. <#/>With this tiny mouse there was a certain degree of neatness. <#/>Examine my Azam

\par <#/>Fresh milk made her lose all sense of control and it was on this occasion only that she had made a mess. <#/>I found that Azam\rquote s milk packaging was <-_this><+_thin> and thus very vulnerable to her sharp molars.

\par <#/>I went back and came again. <#/>Confused it turned back. <#/>Going through the <-_chick><+_chink> had become routine and it did not know what to do when this was closed.

\par <#/>"Mh, that\rquote s }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 trouble with most married people these days. <#/>One way to have a successful marriage is to learn to communicate with your partner, and express yourself without causing conflicts. <#/>In solving a problem, you should attack the prob

\par <#/>After a moment\rquote s silence, Carlos said, "that sounds sensible. <#/>I\rquote ll take your advice, and I\rquote ll go for her as soon as possible". <#/>Fred just smiled and they started working in silence. <#/>After two months of 
staying away from her husband, Helen came to her senses. <#/>She resolved to go for what she thought was best for both Carlos and herself. <#/>Her pride could go to hell, she wasn\rquote 
t risking the man she loved for pride. <#/>She would go to her <-/busband\rquote s> office and they would talk things over, she decided.
\par <#/>A wave of nausea swept over her, for the third time that morning, "I wish Liza was around," she <-_through><+_thought> <-/unhappilly>, as she made for the toilet. <#/>But deep down, she knew it <-/wans\rquote

\par <#/>It was Carlos she wanted. <#/>She had never thought it possible to stay away from him for a few weeks, let alone the months she 
had now spent away from him. <#/>She now understood how much he meant to her. <#/>Whoever said, "absence makes the heart fonder" knew what the impact meant, she reasoned with a sad smile.
\par <#/>One day, just as Carlos was leaving the Bandawe firm premises, he noted a familiar figure walking towards him. <#/>To his surprise he recognised Helen\rquote s beautiful face, and she was smiling at him. <#/>She\rquote 
s more beautiful than ever, he thought as he made quick steps to meet her.
\par <#/>"Hello, wife", he said, half shyly, as he touched her hand and smiled. <#/>"<-/Hillo>, husband," she replied with a broad smile. <#/>"There are matters I\lquote d like us to talk over," he said, looking at her. <#/>}{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24 
 Me too, let\rquote s go home," she responded, and made their reunion even easier than he had imagined.
\par <#/>On reaching their home, Helen got busy in the familiar kitchen preparing the evening meal. <#/>As they ate, they made small talk, and finally broached the subject that was nagging the conscience of each one of them. <#/>They conti
nued talking until they compromised.
\par <#/>Helen <-_wake><+_woke> early the next morning, and tried not to disturb her husband by her side. <#/>The clock on the wall caught her eye, and the date was 28th}{\fs24\super  }{\fs24 June. <#/>A year had gone by since they got married, a

\par <#/>"Morning, darling", said Carlos in a sleepy voice. <#/>"Morning honey. <#/>Happy wedding anniversary"! <#/>Helen conveyed the message. <#/>"Goodness me". <#/>}{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24 
 Is it really true? <#/>" He asked as he sat upright and embraced his wife. <#/>"It is true, Carl," she answered. <#/>"Alas! <#/>You aren\rquote t going to get any present from me dear. <#/>I\rquote m truly broke," he said teasingly.
\par <#/>"That\rquote s no big deal. <#/>I\rquote m broke too, so you can forget about a present," She remarked. <#/>"Carl, we weren\rquote t going to exchange any presents, but I couldn\rquote t help myself. <#/>We\rquote re going to have a baby." <#/>"
How! <#/>That\rquote s the greatest present I ever wanted from you. <#/>What\rquote s it <slang/>gonna be, a baby girl or a baby boy? <#/>" He asked as he hugged her.
\par <#/>"Don\rquote t be silly," she laughed, "How do you expect me to know? <#/>" "Carl, how many children are we going to have?" <#/>"As many as we want, my dear wife. <#/>" <-_The><+_They> laughed, knowing that now their marriage would work out well.</I>

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>The office door swung half open and a lean, pretty face of a mulatto nurse peered in. <#/>"Tea time doctor! <#/>" A vivacious mouth sang the words to the man inside.
\par <#/>Hilda was sure the doctor heard her. <#/>She slammed the door shut and footsteps could be heard dying away as she hurried back along the corridor, eagerly waiting for the doctor to come.
\par <#/>Dr. Imense Rumaitija, a specialist <-/paeditrician>, flung aside the invitation to tea with some foreboding and went on studying the living form that nature chose to hide from a naked human eye, now under a careful scrutiny of a powerful mic
roscope. <#/>As he adjusted and re-adjusted the lenses of the microscope, his brow showed puzzlement at the unusual intrusion from Hilda. <#/>Was there something up her sleeve? <#/>he wondered.
\par <#/>Most doctors at the hospital - in fact all - reflected Dr.
 Rumaitija, had watches which told them when and what they should go out for in the big, regional hospital. <#/>Their life at the hospital was a timed series of calculated regularity, as steady as the <-/rythms> of a heart-beat.
\par <#/>Above all, doctors even without the help of a watch, knew from the clanking and clattering of cups and saucers that a steaming, sugared liquid in a metal kettle was already set on a large table in the recreation room.
\par <#/>It was therefore unthinkable that someone should appoint himself an umpire of some kind for the hospital's activities. <#/>And it was most irritating that, }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct}{\fs24\lang2057 
 that umpire should be Hilda Vinshulal, a 31 year-old unmarried nurse and a cross-breed product of }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  Indo-Tanzania hit-and-run love accident in 1959.
\par <#/>The first person you will meet and know on your first arrival at the hospital, be it at night-time or day-time, is guaranteed against all odds to be Hilda. <#/>She appears to be on duty all the time; all the week, from
 January to January. <#/>She will sidle up to you with a conspicuously exaggerated swinging of her hips and then <-_starts><+_start> talking to you as if both of you have just come from a picnic.
\par <#/>She showers you with embarrassingly intimate questions a
bout your life, your medical problems, whether you are married or not and where your wife or husband is now... <#/>When she allows you to breathe because she has seen someone else who has caught her fancy, and you sigh with relief, you hardly suspect that
 you have supplied ample raw <-_materials><+_material> for her gossip industry to last a couple of days.
\par <#/>To many people, it seemed to them }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  that no event, regardless of where it occurred, whether under the bed in a locked room, or at the goal
-post behind the goal-keeper, escapes Hilda's dancing and searching eyes or her twitching ears.
\par <#/>Mention anything and Hilda has an encyclopaedia about it! <#/>But there was only one thing in the hospital Hilda didn't know of. <#/>It was her corridor baptism. <#/>Hospital staff christened her in absentia: "}{\i\fs24\lang2057 Miss Video}{
\fs24\lang2057 ".
\par <#/>Of late, Hilda had been blowing up a juicy story about Dr. Rumaitijy. <#/>She informed her enraptured listeners that the doctor had beaten his wife's bones out }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>idiom}{\fs24\lang2057 , disowned her, 
then bundled her off together with his two children to her parents' home somewhere in Biharamulo.
\par <#/>The doctor, the story went on, rubbed his hands with glee for having got rid of, as Hilda described, "an ugly nuisance. <#/>" Then, goes on the story, the
 doctor turned to his household belongings. <#/>He sold them all so that he could buy a car. <#/>Hilda even gave the registration number of the car the doctor intended to <-/by>. <#/>"Just think of it! <#/>" She said with feminine concern. <#/>"Sending aw

\par <#/>Dr. Rumaitija knew all Hilda was broadcasting about him. <#/>He was happy, for in a very strange way, it helped him.
\par <#/>Today, }{\i\fs24\lang2057 Miss Video's}{\fs24\lang2057  story about the doctor seems to be making some sense after all. <#/>An old man, tall and naughty, with sharp, stern features had burst into the recreation room asking for Dr. Rumaitija. <#/>As 
always it was Hilda who received him with her usual volley of questions. <#/>"Looks like we have met before. <#/>Where did we meet? <#/>What's your problem? <#/>...Who is Dr. Tija to you? <#/>... Your son-in-law? <#/>..."
\par The old man, unfortunately for the crafty }{\i\fs24\lang2057 Miss Video}{\fs24\lang2057 
, happened to be the type who doesn't go about announcing what colour his underwear is. <#/>"Very urgent, Miss, I want to see him! <#/>" The man curtly replied in a no-nonsense manner. <#/>She tried to melt him with tea, but the man, very
 firmly but courteously told her that a kettle, a cup of tea just weren't exactly what he happened to be thinking about at that time.
\par <#/>Then Hilda, a queen who is not to be beaten so easily, divined them }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  man's behaviour }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>"You 
see! <#/>" She whispered knowledgeably to her colleagues. <#/>"This old man is the doctor's father-in-law from Biharamulo, and he is here to wrench out an explanation as to why his daughter was mauled and dispatched in such a manner. <#/>"To many, it made
 some sense. <#/>Hilda the }{\i\fs24\lang2057 Video}{\fs24\lang2057  knew everything!
\par <#/>Eyes were therefore cast about searchingly in the recreation room. <#/>Dr. Rumaitija wasn't there! <#/>Perhaps he wasn't prepared to meet his father-in-law! <#/>How sweet and exciting to make them meet, 
Hilda thought. <#/>So, it was with that excited feeling of a child reporting another for stealing sugar that Hilda quickly banged her cup on the table and ran to the doctor's office, throwing, very cleverly, that bait: "Tea time doctor!\rdblquote 
\par <#/>When the foot-steps had died down, Dr. Rumaitija scanned through the microscope for the last time, scribbled some observation noted on a sheet of paper, then, putting a heavy book on the sheet of paper, stood up to go to the recreation room.
\par <#/>On arrival, he was captu
red even before he saw the cups. <#/>"A guest for you doctor - <-_and><+_an> old man - could be from Biharamulo. <#/>" Someone informed with pleasure. <#/>All the medical eyes in the room bulged out and never blinked, painstakingly diagnosing and analysin

\par <#/>Intoxicated with pleasure was}{\i\fs24\lang2057  Miss Video}{\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>She revelled in it all - the way the doctor's eyes danced and fell, his changed gait as he crossed the room to meet his guest ..... }{\i\fs24\lang2057 Miss Video}{
\fs24\lang2057 , a graduate in gossip, sat back and watched the show heading for its climax. <#/>To her shocked surprise the show abruptly ended when the doctor, without saying a word, led his guest outside.
\par <#/>There, out of hearing range, the two men stood talking. <#/>The old man was continuously shaking hi
s head in what appeared to be a furious disagreement to the doctor's apparent curled-tail pleadings. <#/>When they parted, everyone believed that the doctor had received an <-/unforgetable> talking to of the year from his father-in-law.
\par <#/>A day or so later, more substance was put into the story when it was officially announced that Dr. Rumaitija would be away for "an emergency leave." <#/>
Hilda, like an over-zealous teacher to his students before a major examination, dashed up and down the hospital corri

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>On that Sunday morning after having breakfast with Adela, I was suddenly seized by a vague desire to write a reply to a letter which my long-time best friend Choggy had sent me some months back from Arusha town.
\par <#/>Choggy and I had known each other for many years since our University days at the HILL, and never had a long time passed without our meeting, more o
ften by the sheerest chance. <#/>Choggy is the only person left to whom I ever troubled myself to write a proper letter. <#/>Of course, I sometimes used to send notes to other friends, just to keep in touch; but it is only to Choggy that I made an effort 
of telling in any way how I felt or what I aspired }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>Me and Choggy became friends under very unusual circumstances: You see, during those youthful years at the HILL, it was difficult to know if one had fully grasped the notion of love, }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>orth}{\fs24\lang2057  
But I, for one, became certainly very aware that the flashing of the emotional sparks in my heart originated from the <-/tranced> languor of desire in Suzy's sweet thrilling young body.
\par <#/>For one whole year at the HILL, Suzy had never by word or deed given me cause for jealousy. <#/>I had seen how other students including Choggy admired her, but for sure I was about her love }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
, that no doubts had ever troubled me.
\par <#/>But during one evening party I caught Choggy making calf eyes at Suzy while th
ey were dancing <-_under><+_to> the strains of Bob Marley's Reggae tune "No woman no cry". <#/>Then after the dance Choggy grabbed Suzy around the waist and pressed his mouth <-/passionatelly> to hers. <#/>And I saw Suzy opening her mouth for him. <#/>Few
 people had observed this. <#/>This gave me a shattering pain.
\par <#/>When I asked her that evening: "If you did not welcome Choggy's kisses why then did you not resist? <#/>" Suzy's eyes as hot as mine responded: "Look Anthony, if you have lived the whole of 
this year with me and <-/can not> trust me, then all your love to me is mockery". <#/>With this Suzy walked away from my life, and my friendship with Choggy began the following day when he approached me to apologize for his misconduct. <#/>By that time it
 was too late and realized }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\b\fs24\lang2057 /}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 subject}{\fs24\lang2057  that Suzy had left me for good. <#/>This is how Choggy and me became friends. <#/>Since then ten years have elapsed.
\par <#/>So on that Sunday morning after having breakfast with Adela I sat at the desk by the open
 window and started <-/writting> a reply to Choggy's letter: It is ages since I heard from you I <-/can not> believe that <-_your><+_you> are still in Bongoland. <#/>You have my address, you know where I live. <#/>When am I going to open the door and see 
you standing on the threshold? <#/>There is so much I want to hear, but since I have no news of you, I can only tell you mine... <#/>'
\par Then I heard Adela calling me from the kitchen. <#/>"Anthony, are you going out to buy some meat for lunch? <#/>It is gett
ing too late. <#/>" At first, I pretended not to have heard her; but then she repeated the question, so I called back, "In a minute, dear. <#/>There is no big hurry, is there".
\par <#/>Choggy had never met Adela, and I often used to wonder if she would like hi
m. <#/>I picked up my pen and continued <-/writting>. <#/>'Adela and I are really happy here at Sinza. <#/>We have repaired the small house we rented and Adela has put some tremendous efforts in creating a unique panorama of flowers and herbs around the h
ouse. <#/>I wish you were here and witnessed the changes }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>I find myself continuously mentioning Adela as if forgetting that you have never met her, but the fact is that my life has become so interwoven with hers that the two of us are now scarcely separable.
\par <#/>'I have not seen any of our old friends since I left the HILL do you remember Suzy, that stunning beauty with high hips I used to chase? <#/>But strangely enough I find that I don't really miss <-/anyone> of them. <#/>Adela has filled
 the gap with a surprising completeness, and I am all contented. <#/>But at the <-/sametime>, I am not so <-/complecent> as to imagine that such a state of affairs is bound to last forever; I hope <-/desparately> that its course has still a long way to ru
n.
\par <#/>'And as for my own part, I even wish we had been married - but Adela for some reasons I cannot understand, maintains that we are better off this way. <#/>We still have our freedom, she says; but God knows, I have never felt more committed, however vo
luntarily, in my life! <#/>Anyhow, the arrangement seems to work as perfectly as I wish in the circumstances, and that's all that really matters... <#/>'
\par Then <-/sunddenly> Adela appeared at the doorway. <#/>She was looking fresh and incredibly beautiful. 
<#/>Dressed in loose and transparent material, she stood there almost nude, with the contours of her beautiful curves revealing the <-/awaresome> strangeness of the <-/femanine> creation. <#/>"I think you would better go to the market and get some meat }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\b\fs24\lang2057 /}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 tense}{\fs24\lang2057 ," She told me <#/>"Who are you <-/writting> to anyway?" She asked.
\par <#/>I rested my arm across the paper, for I did not want her to read what I had written. <#/>"To Choggy," I replied, "I have spoken about him several times, remember?" <#/>"But he <-/does't> often write to you, does he?" 
She asked. <#/>"No, not often. <#/>But that doesn't worry me. <#/>It is just one of those things about him which you have to get used to," I explained.
\par <#/>I turned and smiled up into her eyes. <#/>I <-
/dont> think I had ever felt more deeply in love than at that moment. <#/>And then, with lithe grace, she moved away to the window, I slipped the pages of my letter into the drawer, then pushed back my chair and stood up. <#/>"I <-/wont> be long," I told 
her. <#/>Then I went to the door and left her standing there smiling at me near the window.
\par <#/>That was the last time I saw her, with a beautiful smile hovering on her lips, her hands clasped <-/infront> of her transparent dress, and a vague suspicion of reproach mingled with affection in her radiant eyes.
\par <#/>The market at Mwenge was full of people on that Sunday morning. <#/>From one butchery I bought a kilo of steak, as Adela had requested, then I left the market and set off for home slowly along}{\i\fs24\lang2057  Sam Nujoma Road}{\fs24\lang2057 .

\par <#/>It is really very strange the way I first met Adela: On one boring evening, some few months ago I decided to take a cab to }{\i\fs24\lang2057 Gogo}{\fs24\lang2057  }{\i\fs24\lang2057 Hotel}{\fs24\lang2057 
, just to get away from it all. <#/>Once there, I ordered one full glass of }{\i\fs24\lang2057 cognac}{\fs24\lang2057  at the bar and carried it 
to a corner table close to the window. <#/>And there I sat quietly while a precious-lipped Zairean, commanding the audience to a funeral silence, <-/martyrized> the ghost of Franco (Makiadi) to the <-/accompaniement> of the <-/guiter> whose wailing of the
 lyric acquired a strange and disquieting meaning.
\par <#/>From the window where I sat, for the first time I chanced to see her talking to a good-looking young man. <#/>There was no one else <-_beside>+_besides> and they were obviously unaware of my presence be
hind the window because they were having a quarrel and, although I was little interested in what they were saying, their voices soon rose to such a pitch that the things they were saying made startling hearing. <#/>Then the girl said something very quietl
y which made the man's eyes blazing with fury and he suddenly hit her <-/accross> the cheek!
\par <#/>For a moment she just stood there looking straight at him, then she said, "Shall we go inside and order something to eat? <#/>" They found their way and came to
 <-_seat><+_sit> just two tables away from where I sat. <#/>They ordered dinner and did not say a word to each other all the way through the meal, and when they finished the man got up and went out through the bar, and the girl walked out towards the main
 road <-/possibily> to catch a taxi back home.
\par <#/>I suddenly left my glass of }{\i\fs24\lang2057 cognac}{\fs24\lang2057  unfinished and followed her out. <#/>A few minutes <-/latter> I joined her as I, too, was waiting to catch a taxi. <#/>The quarrel, I had no doubt, had marked its protagon
ists as lovers. <#/>But then having no transport of my own in such a situation, I just pitied myself and felt hopeless because the girl was very beautiful.
\par <#/>For a <-/momented> </hestiated> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar/subject}{\fs24\lang2057  then fully realising how <-/readly> I was in
viting a rebuff I humbly asked her, "Are you waiting for a taxi as well? <#/>We could together stop one and share". <#/>"No, no," she said, "please leave me alone. <#/>" Again I hesitated. <#/>"I am sorry," I said, "I did not mean to intrude, I just thoug
ht that you were... <#/>" I left the sentence unfinished and made as if to return to the Hotel for I had no intention of leaving actually. <#/>But before I could move, she <-_place><+_placed> her hand on my arm. <#/>"Don't go! <#/>" she said.
\par <#/>Now it was
 my turn to be surprised, "It was very kind of you to want to help" she said. <#/>"I was just tired and felt like returning home. <#/>" I invited her back to the bar for some few drinks. <#/>She settled for a cold Safari beer while continued }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar/subject}{\fs24\lang2057  to negotiate with }{\i\fs24\lang2057 cognac}{\fs24\lang2057  on the rocks.
\par <#/>I waited for her to say something, but she did not speak, so at length I asked, "Was it your husband you were <-/querrelling> with?" <#/>"We're engaged to be married until this evening }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24\lang2057 ," s
he said. <#/>There seemed to be no hint of regret in her voice, only a certain <-/bitternes>, <#/>"It is all over now." She concluded.</I>

\par <#/>This name must still be ringing in your memories }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>idiom}{\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>I am sure - cocksure - that you <-_shall>
<+_will> receive this <-/memorium> with joy and the same love you had <-_on><+_for> me when you were a living member of this cruel planet. <#/>The planet that ruthlessly mutilated your innocent body only to be dumped into a jungle filled with hungry hyena
s }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>Maybe I should begin this piece of work by reminding you on }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  how you left this planet forever. <#/>Doing so doesn't mean that you have forgotten it all yourself, but only for }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 
<+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  convenience of those who will not bother }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_to>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 go through this <-/memorium> so that they could join me in shedding tears.
\par <#/>I am compelled to draft this <-/memorium> by the mere fact that yours was not a normal death, therefore it ought to be uncovered to some of your friends, relatives and the 
peace lovers the world over who are not aware of your mysterious departure from this world.
\par <#/>The whole saga went like this: you and colleagues left the country and crossed the giant Ruvuma river into Mozambique on a life-searching tour of that war-torn 
young nation. <#/>Owing to difficulties in transport in that former Portuguese colony, you had to travel on foot miles and miles, hungry and thirsty. <#/>As you might agree with me, in }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
 such journeys, especially in Mozambique, the only thing which 
dominates in the minds is fear. <#/>And that fear comes in the form of a dream. <#/>Unfortunately, <-/sometime> the dream <-_come><+_comes> true. <#/>The most feared people in Mozambique are the armed bandits.
\par <#/>It was not until you had forgotten all abo
ut home, all about your people your mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters and your young lovely wives that you unwillingly and unknowingly stepped into the deadly MNR trap. <#/>That was the beginning of your painful death.
\par <#/>As fate would have it, you were then taken to the death camps of the armed bandits or to call them in their Portuguese name <foreign_>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 Bandidos Armado}{\fs24\lang2057 
<foreign/>. <#/>In the camps you were kept starving for four days without even a single drop of water. <#/>On the fifth day you were force
d to cut one of your precious fingers so that you could quench your thirst by sucking your own blood from the bleeding finger!
\par <#/>Barnaba, this story was narrated to me by one of your colleagues who by }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  mere act of God narrowly escaped from the
 devil's mouth. <#/>He is totally crippled, unable to do anything except talking and eating }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>Hadn't the bandits dismembered his both palms }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
, this <-/memorium> would have been written by him. <#/>Having been deeply moved by the sad story I resolved to put it on paper so as to expose the atrocities committed by the MNR bandits, your killers for that matter.
\par <#/>Dear Barnaba, your life here on earth had been nothing but a mere catalogue of disheartening misfortunes. <#/>For instance just try to go back to the good old days when we used to go to the forest to tap tree-sap which we used to make small balls }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  or }{\i\fs24\lang2057 '}{\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 chandimu'}{\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>Unfortunately, you were good at climbing trees and we were not. <#/>So on that fateful day, you 
had to climb high on the huge tree while we waited.
\par <#/>But when you were half of the way to the peak of the tree, another climber was trailing behind you. <#/>And that climber was none }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_other>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 but a huge snake. <#/>That was a trying moment to }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  your climbing 'career! <#/>' What a fateful day! <#/>For sure, the snake was too big for us to counter-attack, little boys as we were.
\par <#/>I remember to have childishly shouted at you only one sentence, 'Drop! <#/>' I was very sorry that was my only help, the help that only put you on the horns of dilemma }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>idiom}{\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>You were <-/sieged> with two fatal decisions - either responding positively to my 'help' or wait for what would be your fellow climber's action }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>As if my suggestion was a savi
our of the day, in a matter of seconds you were down with us, in a twinkling of an eye, wholly unconscious. <#/>The whole drama was rather shocking and the place abruptly turned ghostly. <#/>Blood was flowing from your ears, mouth and your heart silently 
a
nd faintly beating. <#/>We nearly ran away but thank God you came to your consciousness after a spell of a dead silence. <#/>However, you had suffered a lot. <#/>You had your backbone injured and uprooted your two teeth. <#/>This was but one among a numbe
r of misfortunes that befell you before this one which has resultantly given birth to this obituary.
\par <#/>Now to come to our main subject. <#/>Our crippled friend, I mean the survivor, who happened to be present at the death industry, told me that before you
r final death you had died a thousand deaths as your <-/tormenters> chose to kill you slowly but <-/beastially>. <#/>They began cutting off your right leg with a very sharp <-/matchet>. <#/>You were screaming with untold pain when the thugs turned to your
 remaining leg for the same assignment. <#/>As if that wasn't enough the beasts forced you to drink the blood that was flowing from the wounds.
\par <#/>That wasn't the end of the history as no sooner had you finished to dine }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_on>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 what I may call a tasteless a
nd your last meal in this world, than the bastards cruelly dismembered your both palms. <#/>But, according to the survivor, before they had turned you into a complete torso you asked your killers to spare a minute or so for you so that you could speak you
r last words before you kick the bucket }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>Thanks the thugs did not pay }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057 
 a deaf ear to your request. <#/>Here come what our friend, the survivor, called the ghostly spoken words:
\par Now I must go to <-/haven> as you have succeeded to rob me of my precious life }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
, the life whose role in this world was to take care of my ageing parents and my young brothers. <#/>In the wider range, my life had the role of fighting against poverty, ignorance and, don't forget, the fight agai
nst the people of your calibre, or to put it in the right angle, the suckers of human blood.
\par <#/>I think now you begin understanding that all my life I have been fighting against colonialism and its manifestations, be it actively or passively. <#/>I am wel
l aware of the naked fact that my life has reached its destination, but before I am no more, let me tell you one last thing.
\par <#/>The heart of the matter is that you are not killers of your own will. <#/>The South African Racists have employed you to kill y
our own people. <#/>You are sucking the blood of your own fathers and mothers. <#/>Who do you think you are killing? <#/>It is your own mothers gave you God's rare gift to mankind }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar/subject}{\fs24\lang2057 
 - Life. <#/>You are butchering your own brothers and sisters with whom you shared your mothers' wombs.
\par <#/>You have plunged this country into a state of blood. <#/>The whole once beautiful land is now a vast deep sea of blood. <#/>You have greatly played a part <-_to><+_in> the destabilisation of this country's
 economy. <#/>It is very pitiful that in this highly resourcefully endowed land, people live in sordid poverty. <#/>Because of bloodshed and insecurity the people have been turned into refugees in the country of their birth.
\par <#/>You have betrayed your gran
dparents who for centuries fought fiercely against the Portuguese colonial domination. <#/>Your grandparents fought a bitter war so much so that their grandchildren, you - would inherit a land with peace, love and prosperity.
\par <#/>You deserve to be called p
olitical thugs with no underlined political good. <#/>Your mission is to kill, even <-_the> harmless people. <#/>You are devils in <-_the> human form. <#/>Do not fool yourselves that you will achieve your wicked goals for the hour will come when justice w
ill take its seat and rule without malice to none }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>Lastly, I ask you to cut my throat so that I can die, for that will be the only consolation to my bleeding, mutilated body. <#/>May Allah The Merciful, the Compassionate rest my soul in eternal peace. <#/>Amen.
\par <#/>Those were the last words heard of you in this world as no sooner had you finished <-_you><+_your> narration than life left you. <#/>This was the cruel death I have ever heard of }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>All in all, Barnaba, you are dead a
nd whatever I am going to say you will never wake up from the dead; you are dead like others before and after you. <#/>One last thing is that more and more people have been and others will still be killed by the bandits. <#/>The bandits have gone beyond <
-/boundries> as <-/new> they loot, rape, burn houses and so many ill deeds }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\b\fs24\lang2057 /}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 verb}{\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>However, it is not that people are playing cards in }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 
<+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  time of strife. <#/>The government troops are rubbing shoulders with civilians in order to liquidate the armed bandits. <#/>Do you still remember those catch words we used to hear when tuning to }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{
\fs24\lang2057  Radio Maputo? <#/>You will remember that before any news bulletin came the following: <foreign_><X_>}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 VAMOSH LIQUIDADE BANDIDOS ARMADO}{\fs24\lang2057 </X><foreign/>; meaning 
Let us liquidate the armed bandits. <#/>Those were not good-for-nothing words, bandits will one day be liquidated, liquidated forever }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct}{\fs24\lang2057

\b\v\fs24 <&/>orth}{\fs24  Police and could continue his life. <#/>Pamela had died from a septic abortion.
\par <#/>He had been out of the country at the time and knew nothing about it.
\par <#/>John remembered seeing the beautiful face of Pamela cold and lifeless in the coffin. <#/>When he saw it he felt as if Pamela's soul should <-_had><+_have> jumped out at him and was screaming. <#/>"Because of you, I am dead!'
\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 He had never broken down and cried in public before like that. <#/>After all he was, }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24 
 the handsome, macho, superstar boy of Somasana High School, in Dar es Salaam. <#/>Though he had graduated with honours and was going to study on scholarship, at an elite school in a neighbouring country, he could not help thinking that Pamela's death
 was his fault.
\par <#/>He remembered how he had taken advantage of Pamela on his graduation day, and then hid from her }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24 
. <#/>He had always considered Pamela a nice girl and hoped that they would have had a future together. <#/>But in the meantime he thought that it was quite fine to run around with other not so nice girls to satisfy his ego.
\par <#/>John could not help but think that the devil had possessed him when he seduced Pamela on graduation day. <#/>However, he never knew that she had become pregnant. <#/>He could not blame her for having an abortion as if she did not }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 
<&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24 , she would have been <-/expelleed> from school and unable to finish Form Four.
\par <#/>"Education is the key to life, be you a boy or a girl," his father used to tell him.
\par <#/>John kept feeling guilty }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\b\fs24\lang2057 /}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 connection}{\fs24 
 his friends tried to comfort him saying that the pregnancy was not his fault but John knew that it was. <#/>He tried to prepare for his new school but could not. <#/>One of his friends commented that he was not so macho anymore.
\par <#/>Kellana was recovering
 from her accident. <#/>She had been struck down by a car on her way home from Pamela's funeral. <#/>She felt so bad that her best friend had died that she did not see the road and just stepped in and met her fate. <#/>She would be unable to walk ever aga
in.
\par <#/>Police had questioned Kellana about Pamela's death and if she knew anything about the abortionist. <#/>She decided to keep quiet. <#/>She had never told anyone, but she, }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24 
 herself had had an abortion, done by the same abortionist. <#/>She ha
d survived and thought it was safe for Pamela too. <#/>She kept wondering what had gone wrong. <#/>It was these thoughts and grief for Pamela which clouded her mind and made her careless when crossing roads.
\par <#/>In hospital she would cry and say to herself, "I was only trying to help. <#/>I was only trying to help my friend." <#/>Nurses at the hospital took pity on Kellana.
\par <#/>Just before John left for school, he decided to visit Kellana in hospital. <#/>He had avoided going to see her, because he knew th
at she knew what happened on graduation day. <#/>He wanted to avoid more guilt. <#/>Deep down he knew that if he had not seduced Pamela, she would not have <AmE/>gotten pregnant, had a backdoor abortion and die. <#/>On the other hand Kellana would not hav
e been struck down by a car.
\par <#/>When John went to visit Kellana, he found a few Somasana students with her. <#/>He asked them to excuse him as he wanted to talk to Kellana alone. <#/>The students left giggling and speculating }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24  what he wanted to say
. <#/>They knew that he had had a secret affair with the late Pamela. <#/>The whole school knew.
\par <#/>Kellana offered John a smile, which he returned. <#/>He felt at ease. <#/>He wanted to get a full picture of what had happened to try and clear himself of <-_guilty><+_guilt>.
\par <#/>"Your friend Pamela is dead. <#/>You know what happened at the graduation ceremony. <#/>But who did the abortion. <#/>Who killed, }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24  my child", John said.
\par <#/>Kellana was shocked that John had been so open and admitted the relationship. <#/>"I do not want to talk about it John, what is done is done! <#/>'
\par But, John pleaded with Kellana to tell him what happened. <#/>She only admitted that Pamela had told her that she was pregnant and that John was the only one she had had a relation with.
\par <#/>One of the nurses, }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24  was listening to a radio. <#/>Just, }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24 
 then the music of Leonard Rich was playing. <#/>Images of Pamela stormed through his mind. <#/>He excused himself and left the hospital in a hurry. <#/>The next day he was off to his }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>orth}{\fs24  Elite School.
\par <#/>Kellana could not forget the look of guilt that she saw in John's eyes. <#/>She felt strange to see the macho image reduced to a mouse. <#/>Anyway, she 
knew that he would get a good education, marry some fresh young girl and live happily ever after. <#/>She felt that she would never get married to a handsome, worthy man. <#/>She fell asleep as she remembered Pamela.
\par <#/>Kellana was discharged from hospital after a three month stay. <#/>She had been bought a shiny new wheelchair. <#/>Somasana students had contributed money buying it }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
. <#/>She was able to continue with her schooling, after the school made special arrangements so that she could attend in her wheelchair.
\par <#/>Other students pushed Kellana to school in the morning and home in the evening. <#/>Kellana was determined to make the best of life, which she had concluded was precious and should <-/belived> as comfortably as possible. <#/>Her 
marks which had been average rose putting her in the class top 5. <#/>She would be able to go for Form 5 studies, and then on to University. <#/>But her aim was to go and study abroad, in a country where facilities for the handicapped were easily availabl
e.
\par <#/>Sometimes she would go near the <-_abortionist><+_abortionist's> house, and watch who was coming out. <#/>She wondered how <-_may><+_many> girls would end up, }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24 
 dead like Pamela. <#/>She shook her head. <#/>The stinking, <-/balled> headed man
 always made his clients sleep with him before he did his dirty work. <#/>She wondered how she could make up for Pamela's death. <#/>Whenever she passed there she felt as if she could see her friend going in and coming out.
\par <#/>Kellana had just finished her final exams. <#/>The graduation ball would be held the next day. <#/>She remembered the last years graduation }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
, and her friend Pamela. <#/>On her way home, Kellana passed by a church which was offering evening prayers. <#/>Some churchgoers offered to take her inside, and she happily agreed.
\par <#/>The preacher was talking about love, honesty and kindness. <#/>He said that people who embodied such qualities in their lives had the ticket to eternal peace. <#/>She went home reflecting on what the preacher had said.
\par <#/>It was graduation day, the students lined up and received their school leaving certificates. <#/>Kellana was <-/jubiliant>. <#/>She had seen her Form Four graduation, she wished Pamela was still alive.
\par <#/>During, }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24  the disco the music of Leonard Rich, }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24 
 dominated. <#/>Kellana remembered how Pamela also enjoyed it. <#/>She immediately left the schoolgrounds. <#/>She struggled to push her wheelchair tyres to get to the nearest Police Station, the time had come to put things right.
\par <#/>She reported the abortionist. <#/>The Police were surprised why she had suddenly decided to talk about it. <#/>The Police decided to lay a trap for the abortionist.
\par <#/>It was a week later, }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24  that Kellana saw the abortionist handcuffed and led to a }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>orth}{\fs24 
 Police car. <#/>Police found abortion tools, blood and other evidence needed to convict him. <#/>The young woman who had gone to him that day for an abortion was actually an undercover  }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>orth}{\fs24  Policewoman.
\par <#/>Kellana felt as if a 
heavy load had been lifted off her shoulder. <#/>As the abortionist was led out, she thought that she could see Pamela walking by. <#/>She turned her head too much and fell out of her wheelchair. <#/>As people rushed to assist her, she got up by herself a
nd stood. <#/>People screamed in shock at what they saw.
\par <#/>Kellana took one step forward, then another, "I can walk, I can walk again." <#/>Kellana jubilantly shouted. <#/>Her feet were shaking, but she insisted on walking home.
\par <#/>The abortionist was sentenced to life imprisonment, but died shortly afterwards from a heart attack.
\par <#/>John had come to Dar es Salaam for holidays. <#/>He heard of the 'miracle'. <#/>Kellana was walking again. <#/>It was the talk of the town.
\par <#/>He went to see Kellana at her house. <#/>He felt that the visit would help relieve his guilt. <#/>When he saw Kellana she was as beautiful as ever, radiating an <-/undescribable> beauty. <#/>He felt touched, this was the same bedridden girl, }{
\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24  he had left behind he said to himself. <#/>He could not <-/beleive> it.
\par <#/>Kellana greeted John. <#/>She showed no signs of resentment to him. <#/>"Pamela has helped me, }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24  to be a person again. <#/>" Kellana said.
\par <#/>"Pamela has sent me to see you. <#/>" John said. <#/>"Congratulations for finishing Form Four and ... walking again. <#/>I never expected you to, not after what we were told..." John said hesitantly.
\par <#/>"No one expected me to, not even myself," Kellana said.
\par <#/>"I could not stop thinking about you, even in your crippled state. <#/>That is why, }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24  I came to see you," John said.
\par <#/>The two agreed that mistakes had been made, but that life goes on. <#/><-/Afterall> people learn through mistakes. <#/>They pledged to keep in contact with each other.
\par <#/>John and Kellana both went for studies in Europe, and got married. <#/>At the wedding they confided that they felt as if Pamela was watching.
\par <#/>Somasana High School students have turned the Pamela story into part of their school history as a lesson to others.</I>

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>When it came to everyday matters, I was extremely forgetful. <#/>I forgot <-_colleagues><+_colleagues
'> names during introductions, I forgot my change when shopping and I invariably forgot where I'd left my spectacles whenever I took them off for a while. <#/>My girlfriend Maggie often got stranded on dates that we planned and I forgot.
\par <#/>The reason for
 this apparently poor memory of mine is a very busy mind. <#/>By profession I'm a Commercial Product Designer and when it comes to engineering and scientific data, I possess a phenomenal memory. <#/>I can quote, with accuracy, for instance, trigonometric 
values of most angles and the coefficients of most engineering parameters. <#/>I know almost all mathematical and scientific formulae by heart and I'm obsessed with my work.
\par <#/>I have always perceived the great engineering feats as man's triumph over nature. <#/>I admire the men who engineered products like the }{\i\fs24\lang2057 Boeing 747}{\fs24\lang2057 
, the space shuttle, the bullet trains, the super-computers, the undersea tunnels... the list is long.
\par <#/>I have resolved to join this exalted group of men who worked at the frontlines of 
removing man's physical limitation. <#/>I thought that if one did not succeed in unravelling the mystery of Creation in this life, then at least one should have the consolation of having contributed something new to it.
\par <#/>When Maggie and I eventually dec
ided to get married, my friends became very excited at the prospect of a married me and they wondered how I'd found the time to woo Maggie. <#/>James, one of my best friends and who was to be my best man explained to them that it was Maggie who had done t
he wooing. <#/>He had also joked, in front of my other friends, telling me not to forget to come to my own wedding and they had all laughed because they knew me.
\par <#/>We formed a wedding preparations committee and worked hard and enthusiastically. <#/>Three weeks before the planned wedding date, we had one of our usual }{\i\fs24\lang2057 '}{\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 Vikao'}{\fs24\lang2057 
 to review the progress made in collecting contributions, working out details with regard to transport, invitations }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24  }{\fs24\lang2057 drinks, food .... etc.
\par <#/>It was during this particular <ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 Kikao}{\fs24\lang2057 
 that James triggered off my Technical-Problem-solving mind. <#/>He dramatically, with deep furrows of thought creasing his forehead, lifted his glass containing cold Safari beer and said, "Why do glasses containing cold beer always get wet on 
the <-/outtside>? <#/>I'm sure everybody hates this. <#/>Anyone who invents a glass that will remain dry on the outside even whilst containing a cold drink is sure to become a millionaire!\rdblquote 
\par <#/>That was an interesting problem. <#/>And once my mind locks onto a problem, it never lets go until that problem has been solved. <#/>Otherwise the challenge remains like an addictive drug that my mind won't release.
\par <#/>As far as that and subsequent meetings went, I was there in body only. <#/>So deeply did I become involved in the design of the dry or non-sweating glass, that the later success of my wedding could only be credited to my <-_friends><+_friends\rquote 
> selflessness and dedication; I was not with them.
\par <#/>Even my fiancee Maggie, }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24  }{\fs24\lang2057 got worried by my spells of absentmindedness. <#/>When she talked to me about her family's preparations for her send-off party, I merely nodded and said something non-committal.

\par <#/>The scientific explanation for the problem was this; the outside surfaces of glasses containing cold drinks provided cold surfaces on which water vapour from the atmosphere condensed.
\par <#/>The material would also have to withstand and not crack under thermal <-_stresses><+_stress> due to temperature differences across its thickness. <#/>It would also have to resemble glass to satisfy the conservative drinkers.
\par <#/>As my wedding day drew closer so too did I get closer to the solution of the problem. <#/>I spent any spare time that I had in the University Reference Library, digging for information. <#/>
The wedding preparations had gone so well that by the great day we were all set. <#/>On the very morning of the wedding day, I decided to go to the Library to have one last look at Transparent Superinsulators. <#/>These materials were the key to my proble
m. <#/>I thought the search for information would only take half an hour or so and that I'd be home by the time James, my <-/best man> came for final preparations before we went to church for the ceremony.
\par <#/>I do not quite remember for how long I'd been i
n the library, for I had lost myself in concentration on the materials books. <#/>I was roused by the sound of running footsteps, very unnatural in a library. <#/>It was James. <#/>He was fully dressed for his role as best man and he was breathless and sw
eating. <#/>He was carrying a large brown paper parcel. <#/>I'd never seen him so angry before.
\par <#/>"What the hell are you playing at? <#/>" He shouted pointing to his watch, "I've been searching all over the town for you! <#/>We are supposed to <-/>to be in church now!\rdblquote 
\par <#/>The }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>orth}{\fs24\lang2057  Librarian and a few readers came to see what the commotion was all about. <#/>James explained urgently, "This man is late for his wedding!" <#/>
He threw the large brown paper parcel to me and said, "Get behind a shelf and get dressed, that's your suit!\rdblquote 
\par <#/>I had the presence of mind to react appropriately. <#/>I hurriedly dressed in the library and James helped me with the finishing touches. <#/>We were ready in four minutes flat.
\par <#/>We ran out to his car and we roared off
 in a hurry towards St. Joshua's Church where the wedding mass was to be celebrated. <#/>The car screeched to a stop in the church compound and we ran up the steps to the door of the church to join a weeping Maggie and her maid of honour - she had lost ho
pe.
\par <#/>We walked unceremoniously down the aisle towards the altar. <#/>We were late and Father Sean frowned disapprovingly but officiated the ceremony anyway.
\par <#/>During his sermon, I reflected on how little this little ceremony meant to most people. <#/>I
t was the food and drink afterwards that mattered most. <#/>Success or failure of a 'wedding' was generally evaluated on the basis of the number of people intoxicated to the point of being disabled by overdoses of alcohol.
\par <#/>Later in the reception hall, the champagne bottle was opened <-/amids> excitement and ululations and poured into our glasses.
\par <#/>The Master of Ceremonies instructed us and everybody else to stand up glass in hand and to drink to the health of the bride and groom.
\par <#/>I raised my glass to Maggie and noticed the droplets of moisture that were beginning to form on the outside of the glass; the champagne must have been chilled. <#/>In the lights of the decorated hall and flashing cameras, the water droplets acted like
 prisms and, by tricks of light they looked like finely polished gemstones in a priceless crown.
\par <#/>And because of the droplets, my mind was transported back to the problem of the 'dry' or 'non-sweating' glass. <#/>I forcibly tried to withdraw my attention
 from all the raised glasses (people were saying 'cheers') and James must have noticed the strain of my effort he knew me well }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 ; he asked if there was anything wrong.
\par <#/>Later when we had relaxed, I told him, right there at the high table about my design problem.
\par <#/>James said, "why don't you concentrate on Maggie for a change? <#/>I assure you, she is enough material for your researches for a lifetime!\rdblquote 
\par <#/>I had to laugh. <#/>James was the best }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>orth}{\fs24  }{\fs24\lang2057 Bestman I could get. <#/>I brought my attention back to Maggie and the most important day of my life so far.

\par <#/>Adella's <-/high pitched> voice disturbed and changed the whole picture of the room.
\par <#/>It was <-_a><+_the> talk of the year in Makao Village in Musoma Rural District.
\par <#/>"This is a real coincidence I've ever seen }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 , one man was heard saying.
\par <#/>"It's terrible", the second one replied. <#/>And much was said over the event. <#/>This is how it happened:
\par Old Isaya Massanje Magessa was very popular in Makao Village. <#/>He was said to be the richest man in the village. <#/>He was said to have born }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057 
 nine children among them eight strong males. <#/>One of his sons; }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24  }{\fs24\lang2057 Justin had built a house for his father. <#/>It was 
the only modern house in the village. <#/>Not only that, he also bought a three-and a-half tonne }{\i\fs24\lang2057 Mitsubishi Canter}{\fs24\lang2057  to help his father and the family at large.
\par <#/>Thus Isaya was the only man with a modern house and a car in the village. <#/>You wouldn't mistake him if you go to the village }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>Stories were made }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057 
 of him and his good luck, and children sang about him in their songs. <#/>The proud Isaya always wore a smile on his face and helped to provide transport to the villagers.
\par <#/>Justin Massanje Magessa was the fifth son. <#/>By }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  the time of this <-_incidence><+_incident>, which }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 in fact he was the bridegroom, he was 28 years old. <#/>He was the only son of Isaya who had studied up to university level. <#/>In fact, no <-_any> other son nor daughter of Isaya had gone beyond primary level.
\par <#/>Isaya himself did not mind much about this for he'd all the cattle to <-/sastain> his nine children. <#/>When Justin continued well with his studies, he gave all the su
pport possible. <#/>It was because of this support that Justin built a big house and bought a car for his father as a gesture of appreciation.
\par <#/>Unfortunately, Zainabu Massanje Magessa, the mother of nine children died when Justin was 12 years old. <#/>She had died when delivering the ninth child, who turned out to be a girl. <#/>The girl was named Zainabu after her late mother.
\par <#/>Isaya went as far as swearing that he won't marry another woman to help him bring up the children }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>And that is what he really did }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>sense}{\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>No one could deny it, that Isaya and Justin were more than friends. <#/>Isaya himself was very much proud of his son }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  and he didn't hide it.
\par <#/>He was always talking about Justin, who was still a bachelor while the rest of children including Zainabu, were married.
\par <#/>When Isaya was told by other elders to ask Justin to get married, he always answered them that Justin would marry whenever and whoever he wanted. <#/>The people were worried about
 this, thinking that Justin would marry a woman from far away. <#/>They wanted their lone university graduate to marry a girl from their village to be chosen by a team of selected elders.
\par <#/>This was vigorously rejected by Isaya, who emphasized his previous stand.
\par <#/>Days went on. <#/>Later, Justin won a scholarship for }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  masters degree in economics. <#/>When he broke the news to Isaya, he nearly ran mental }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>slang}{\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>The news was so pleasing, and that night, Isaya kept praying for his son's safety and successes. <#/>A few days later, Justin left for England.
\par <#/>It was when he was in Europe when he met a girl }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  who for the first time his heart loved. <#/>The girl was called Erica, and to his surprise she was also coming from Tanzania }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\b\fs24 /}{
\b\v\fs24 aspect}{\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>She was taking her first degree in architecture.
\par <#/>Erica, coming from Mara Region as Justin, was very beautiful. <#/>She had a fair complexion with beautiful milk-white teeth; the qualities Justin knew would interest very much his father}{\b\fs24  }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\b\fs24 /word order}{
\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>He presented her to him. <#/>All this time he had not expressed his feelings to Erica. <#/>And when he made his move, the response was favourable, and soon enough they were well madly in love }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 .

\par <#/>Had it not been for the respect they have for their parents }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24\lang2057 , they would have got married in Europe.
\par <#/>"I can't marry you without my mother being around", Erica had said, and Justin agreed with her. <#/>For he also did not want to marry in the absence of his dearest friend - his father!
\par <#/>While }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  two were studying and having a good time abroad, something happened at home. <#/>Isaya in }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057 
 course of his business one day made a stopover at Kiabakari Village. <#/>He stayed there for three days. <#/>While there, he heard a lot of stories about a widow who was made rich by her six beautiful daughters. <#/>He was told that for one }{
\b\fs24\lang2057 <+_to>}{\fs24\lang2057  get married to one of her girls, one had to pay a big bride price. <#/>And when Isaya saw the woman, he was deeply attracted.
\par <#/>However he didn't do anything until he had finished his business. <#/>And when he talked to the beautiful Adella Martin Okello, she also found out that Isaya was what she was looking for.
\par <#/>She had heard a lot about him, though she hadn't seen him before. <#/>A new life developed between them. <#/>Finally they wedded }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057  and lived together. <#/>Adella, who was as boastful as Is
aya, never told her new husband about her daughter who was studying in Europe.
\par <#/>Isaya, as expected, told her about his son Justin. <#/>But he did not tell his son that he got married to another woman }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24\lang2057  for fear that Justin will object to the move }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar/tense}{
\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>"Let the kid study in peace", he said to himself.
\par <#/>Days went }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057 , and the date of their return to Tanzania arrived. <#/>They returned together, and were now living in <-_the> Justin's house. <#/>While in Europe th
ey had bought all domestic items and appliances, }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct}{\fs24\lang2057  jointly. <#/>They'd bought a }{\i\fs24\lang2057 Hilux}{\fs24\lang2057  pick-up.
\par <#/>A week before their return, Justin wrote a very long letter to Isaya telling him all that has happened }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24\lang2057 , including the fact that he had met Erica.
\par <#/>Finally they were home. <#/>No one could explain the happiness Isaya had when he saw his son back! <#/>Isaya ordered the biggest he-goat to be slaughtered.
\par <#/>After settling down, <-/Justine> broke the news about his future plans with Erica. <#/>The news <-_were><+_was> so exhilarating to Isaya who had for long been waiting for this moment.
\par <#/>"What good news my son! <#/>You don't know how a father feels when he sees his son get married. <#/>So you're going to get married to a Luo like me. <#/>It's good and I'm happy about it! <#/>" Isaya said with a broad smile on his face.
\par <#/>Justin had promised to bring his bride on the following day, }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct}{\fs24\lang2057  that day, the cow was slaughtered. <#/>The house was cleaned and everything was neatly arr
anged. <#/>It was a very hectic day for Adella, who supervised the work. <#/>It was not until after 3.45 p.m. when she went to take bath }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>Justin had said he would bring the <-/bride to be> at 4 p.m., and according to Isaya, everybody should be at the house when they arrive }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>The }{\i\fs24\lang2057 Canter}{\fs24\lang2057 
 was sent to collect relatives. <#/>So the house was full of people.
\par <#/>Exactly at 4.00 p.m., Justin pulled up the car before the house. <#/>Zainabu was the first to welcome them. <#/>She took her <ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 wifi}{\fs24\lang2057 
 and together with other in-laws, went inside the house where Isaya was eagerly waiting.
\par <#/>When Isaya heard the car, he called Adella who was in their bedroom. <#/>"Adella, where are you? <#/>What are you doing all that time? <#/>Come, quickly!
\par <#/>"Hey. <#/>I'm coming man," she replied from the room.
\par <#/>Then the delegation entered in.
\par <#/>"<ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 Karibu}{\fs24\lang2057 ! <#/><ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 Karibu}{\fs24\lang2057 ! <#/>Welcome my daughter, welcome! <#/>Don't be afraid. <#/>This is your home, feel at home and relax," he told the prospective bride.
\par <#/>After a while, Justin introduced his brothers, sisters, uncles and others to Erica.
\par <#/>"Oh it's good my son. <#/>I'm <-/happly> to see you and your fiancee.
\par <#/>As you know, all of your brothers and sisters are already married. <#/>You
 were the only one remaining. <#/>Personally, I'm delighted and let me not talk much, just wait for your mother to see her and then we, adults, will sit down and talk this over...\rdblquote 
\par <#/>The door was opened and Adella came out.
\par <#/>"What! <#/>She <-/explaimed>.
\par <#/>Erica hid her face into her hands. <#/>Everybody was surprised and couldn't believe what was happening. <#/>There rose a big confusion }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057  which could not easily be solved.

 for years until I came to Dar es Salaam and met Darly. <#/>I am a journalist, working for MAELEZO.
\par <#/>For <-/sometime>, I have been in the upcountry regions }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24\lang2057 
 but then thought I should try my potentials in the city of Heaven of Peace. <#/>The housing problem in the city forced me to rent a cheap room at Manzese Uzuri area, where my dear wife could sa
ve some money on fares by walking to and from the nearby school where she teaches.
\par <#/>When I say I have been living happily, I <-_real><+_really> mean it. <#/>I am an ardent supporter of }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  <-_women><+_women's> liberation movement. <#/>Call me a 
feminist if you like and I will <-/heartly> accept it without any problems.
\par <#/>I have always supported and forwarded the struggle for }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  emancipation of women to the extent that some <slang/>fellas find it funny and point it out that "<ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 nimeolewa}{
\fs24\lang2057 " (I am under control of my wife's <-/apion> strings) and some go to the extent of commenting that I should join the U.T.W. <#/>All I can say to them is that "I may be weak to women but I am not a male chauvinist pig".
\par <#/>And hence by this stand, my wife came to know me better and the harmony between herself }{\v\fs24\lang2057 <-_>between herself<-/> }{\fs24\lang2057 and me blossomed.
\par <#/>Darly or Daria is our neighbour two blocks away. <#/>Her job is something to be derived, but she seems to do well and fine. <#/>Her sense of joyfulness and humour makes her acceptable in any social group and function. <#/>She is }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 
<+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  kind of <-/busy body> and she is warmly welcomed at all the households around our place.
\par <#/>It was not surprising then to accept her when she befriended my wife and proved helpful in every get-together. <#/>She showed my wife around and <-_socialize><+_socialized> her with the city life }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>idiom}{\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>I also came to find her helpful to my convictions on women lib ideas.
\par <#/>Darly took a liking <-_on><+_for> me to the extent that, if not for her charm }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  people could have suspected <-_of> an affair between me and her.
\par <#/>When close to me, she liked to make me a laughing stock. <#/>"That tie is too broad and heavy, with this heat, you could use it for a handkerchief", she could remark whenever I put on one of those odd looking ties of mine.
\par <#/>Once she came to our place, clad in a T-shirt scribbled "<ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 Kamikaze}{\fs24\lang2057 ." <#/>As we were sipping some soft drinks, I told her what the words meant and I elaborated her }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057 
, how during World War Two, Japan seeing its possible defeat, resorted into using the "<ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 Kamikaze}{\fs24\lang2057 " (suicide) commandos to distract Americans winning the war.
\par <#/>Darly was so much impressed with the story but she had an air of just playing along simply not to annoy me, but she seemed to know it all along. <#/>She used to wear the T-shirt just t
o please me. <#/><-/Any way> as long as I had an inbuilt faculty never to hurt women morally even physically, I played it cool.
\par <#/>I am sorry, I did not mention that I am a renowned artist, specialising in portraits and graphic art, and this is what Darly seemed to be much interested on me }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>She liked to comment positively on my art works and I knew the comments were deep from her heart.
\par <#/>"You know, this young lady could be much more elaborated with a blue attire that could match well with the background", she could remark on a composition of a village woman grinding flour on a grinding stone.
\par <#/>One day I had a day off from work and was preparing a feature on problems of women in town, when Darly came around and volunteered to give me so
me vivid instances from her own experience. <#/>She then asked me if I was prepared to visit some grotesque areas and take some photos if I liked.
\par <#/>I was overwhelmed <-_with><+_by> the offer and was ready to sacrifice my time on the task. <#/>Darly prov
ed to be true to her words and the mission was a success. <#/>So, when she invited me to her friend's for a coke I did not object. <#/>But then out of the blues, she asked me, if I could do her a favour.
\par <#/>Of course I accepted even before being told what that favour would be. <#/>Darly wanted me to do her a }{\i\fs24\lang2057 "puris naturalibus"}{\fs24\lang2057  portrait in oil, with nothing on except her "<ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 Kamikaze}{
\fs24\lang2057 " T-shirt.
\par <#/>I was reluctant to undergo the task, knowing what it might lead to. <#/>I offered many excuses but in vain. <#/>She was desperate to get her way.
\par <#/>I have seen many nude works of art veterans such as <-/Piccaso> and I had even tried to do some without a live model and this could be the first time I have a ready volunteer before me }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>"It wi
ll take me long to finish all your torso in oil" I objected. <#/>"Why don't I just photograph you instead", I suggested, buying time and distracting her wild ideas, knowing well that I could not develop the photograph anywhere without raising a few eye br
ows.
\par <#/>All my objections seemed to hit a solid wall of concrete fuss. <#/>It happened that my convincing powers were not strong enough to elude her wild desperation. <#/>Eventually, there was no way out for me but to pretend that I was giving in to her fu
ss so she could leave me alone, but fast she was }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 , she devised a quicker way to trap me.
\par <#/>As we were sipping cokes, she took trouble to <-_handle><+_hand> me album after album of some of her fantastic <-/breath taking> photos followed by some
 exotic foreign magazines, accompanied by sweet flowing music from the background while her consistent fuss persisted. <#/>Being weak as I was to women, I slowly succumbed to her wild whims.
\par <#/>This was the prelude to what she had planned <-/before hand>. <#/>After some months later }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 my wife Sebe knew of our affair and she decided to give me a cold shoulder, but I was hooked to Darly and I said she could pack and go. <#/>She left.

\par <#/>Yet the Professor conversed with his wife in euphemisms. <#/>Despite his seclusion he was very suspicious of intruders, did not like }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057 
 any eavesdroppers, doctors or nurses on duty, who might enter into the room unceremoniously to get wind of his intentions.
\par <#/>This was one of the times when the P
rofessor regretted <-_for> not marrying a woman from his tribe. <#/>They would have conversed in vernacular without much fear <-_from><+_of> being overheard. <#/>He, from a <-/normad> tribe, had married a woman from a settled, farming ethnic </O>.
\par <#/>"The woman sat by the hospital bed, indecisively. <#/>"I was about to forget. <#/>Doctor Sweetface is outside. <#/>He also wants to see you," his wife changed the topic at the drop of a hat.
\par <#/>"I didn't want him to enter together with me. <#/>I knew we could have difficulty in exchanging something he was not supposed to hear", his wife added.
\par <#/>Dr. Sweetface was a foreign expert working at a unit on research on rodents in the Washupavu Republic.
\par <#/>Professor Kitiku was the unit's new boss who had been assigned to make }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057  thorough research on the rodents which were devouring the crops and other Washupavu's belongings.
\par <#/>He loathed the President for demoting him. <#/>Furthermore he (President) has misallocated him. <#/>For <-_the><+_a> person like him who held a Ph.D. in Entomology he was supposed to deal with insects }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar/subject}{
\fs24\lang2057 , he thought.
\par <#/>But for long }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>idiom}{\fs24\lang2057 , before his recent demotion, the Professor was the Director General of the National Agricultural Marketing Board. <#/>There he could mint money. <#/>Not in the tiny unit on rodents!
\par <#/>He was among the reputed academicians of the Washupavu Republic. <#/>Having graduated overseas, '<ea/>Ughaibuni', he lectured for a number of years back home at the then only university.
\par <#/>His rise was meteoric. <#/>It was not stunning that he held various Presidential appointed posts.
\par <#/>But Kitiku believed that intellectuality and diligence were insufficient to enable him }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <+_to>}{\fs24\lang2057  enjoy the national cake.
\par <#/>He also believed in witchcraft, a term he always evaded. <#/>He called it "fortification". <#/>One should be fortified against his or her enemies in life, he believed.
\par <#/>He held a philosophy that metaphysics bred with science could yield a "hybrid" - stronger than either of the two elements - to make one run a balanced life.
\par <#/>Outwards, he appeared pious. <#/>He frequented the church, prayed, sang and offered tithes. <#/>Sometimes a priest would conduct prayers at his home.
\par <#/>The Professor's sitting room had religious murals, pictures and scriptures on the walls. <#/>Some read: }{\i\fs24\lang2057 "Jesus is the Head of this house" or "For God so loved the world that He sent His only begotten Son ...\rdblquote 
\par <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Other drawings showed Jesus Christ in various stages of persecution. <#/>There were angels or Virgin Mary.
\par <#/>Yet the Professor would surreptitiously consult a witch doctor, an act considered sinful in the <-/churchcircles> to give him some <-/portions> in order to be lucky and go on holding top posts.
\par <#/>His favourite doctor was Vituko of Uroghi village. <#/>Vituko always clad }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\b\fs24\lang2057 /}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057 
 in weird animal straps but had a lot of cattle he bought from money he accumulated from his customers.
\par <#/>Whenever the Professor visited him, Vituko would always say that he had been admonished that the "<non-st/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 profesa is coming}{\fs24\lang2057 " the previous night.
\par <#/>Then the witch doctor would gather his pebbles and tiny gourds. <#/>He would enter into a penultimate room and signal the Professor to follow him up. <#/>There he would speak hysterically and make some antics.
\par <#/><ea_><X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 "}{\i\v\fs24\lang2057 Cha! Cha! Cha-a-a, auwii. Mganga gangua}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>}{\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>I see a very bad person in front of you. <#/>He wants to eliminate you," Vituko would say.

\par <#/>Then he would stop abruptly and summon his gourds. <#/><-/Chatterring> voices like those of mice would be heard from the gourds. <#/>The Professor would not understand what they meant. <#/>But Vituko would say they admonished everything on }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  Kitiku's life.
\par <#/>Then he would give the Professor some concoctions. <#/>The learned man would pay }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  <-/lump sum>, thanking Vituko. <#/>He would drive home contented, believing that no bad person would cross his way.

\par <#/>Vituko's medicines would even blindfold the President from seeing the Professor's corrupt acts, he believed.
\par <#/>He had accu
mulated a lot of money through dubious means and built three houses. <#/>Two were rented to some foreign experts who were working in the country. <#/>They paid him in foreign exchange and would convert illegally. <#/>The other house was left for his paren
ts to live in.
\par <#/>For two decades since he started lecturing, his parents came to live in the Mambovuma city }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24\lang2057 
, the capital of Washupavu Republic. <#/>There were several houseboys working for his parents living in one of }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  posh ar
eas of the city. <#/>So he was stunned when he realised that he had been demoted from the director general of the National Agricultural Marketing Boards to the research unit.
\par <#/>He suspected that one of his jealous subordinates had engineered his downfall and Vituko would deal with him.
\par <#/>After being removed from the Marketing board, he had to vacate the house he used to live in }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct}{\fs24\lang2057  a serene, posh place and go to Legeza Mwendo street, also in the city, where the research unit had its flats.

\par <#/>He did not like }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057  to live in one of his houses as that would curtail his financial channels.
\par <#/>On the first day's night in the new place in Legeza Mwendo street, the Professor witnessed a terrifying incident he had not been used to in other places of the city he lived at.
\par <#/>A huge cat stared at him the moment he went out to tend the call of nature.
\par <#/>The Professor believed that somebody had cast a spell <-_onto><+_on> him. <#/>The creature was a wizard or something evil, <-/masquarded> as a cat, to kill him. <#/>He felt short of breath.
\par <#/>He came back into <-_him><+_his> room yelling "}{\i\fs24\lang2057 Oh! <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 <ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 Wameniweza}{\fs24\lang2057 
 and collapsed. <#/>His wife, a houseboy and elder children even woke the neighbours up and the sick Professor was rushed to the hospital in his own car driven by his son.
\par <#/>At the hospital, the doctor on shift examined him and found nothing serious. <#/>He was given some soporific drugs and slept.
\par <#/>The following morning he woke up still agitated whenever he recalled the cat incident. <#/>That was why he had to have a tete-a-tete with his wife }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
 what to do next. <#/>But he believed that Dr. Sweetface could not have engineered his elimination. <#/>Few intellectuals from Ughaibuni would dare <-_engaged><+_engage> in such a thing, he believed, unless were researchers }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 
<&/>grammar/subject}{\fs24\lang2057  on anthropology, he thought.
\par <#/>He had no qualms <-_with><+_about> Dr. Sweetface. <#/>So he allowed him to come in. <#/>The doctor apologised for delaying the Professor's wife as they had to come toget
her after he had completed dealing with the journalists who had come in the morning wanting to know what the unit was doing to have the cat population controlled.
\par <#/>"Prof. I like journalists sometimes. <#/>They are not always after scandals. <#/>Indeed t
here has been a high population of stray cats in our area. <#/>I think they will stir something from the concerned bodies to check those cats. <#/>They are really a nuisance," Dr. Sweetface said.
\par <#/>Professor Kitiku's eyes widened. <#/>"I told them to see the livestock officer for the solution," Dr. Sweetface added.
\par <#/>"There is a high population of cats, eh! <#/>I didn't know that," said the Professor perplexed.
\par <#/>"How would you know that. <#/>You're new in our area Prof. <#/>I have been there for some months. <#/>I know <-_how><+_what> a nuisance the creatures could be }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24\lang2057 " said the doctor.
\par <#/>Something rang the bell in the Professor's mind. <#/>The cat he had seen the previous day was perhaps a true cat. <#/>He felt like he was recuperating. <#/>He had not been accustomed to living in poor areas like Legaza Mwendo, for decades.
\par <#/>What are the lives in the villages and slums of the Washupavu Republic, he thought. <#/>He should go home. <#/>He was no longer sick. <#/>He smiled. <#/>"Aah! <#/>So that is the situation! <#/>" He did not like }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{
\fs24\lang2057  Dr. Sweetface to know what ideas the Professor had on cats.
\par <#/>Then the doctor on duty saw the Professor smiling. <#/>He came towards his bed. <#/>He greeted him knowing that his patient was recovering - after being given sleeping drugs only as he was merely frightened.
\par <#/>"I hope you're not feeling bad anymore, Professor. <#/>I will discharge you soon," the doctor said. <#/>The Professor's face wore a broad smile.</I>

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Moses introduced me to the landlord, <ea/>Mzee Ngogwe who also lived in the same house as the tenants. <#/>He looked me up and down as if sizing and weighing me up. <#/>In his hands lay my fat
e, whether I would get a room in this house or not.
\par <#/>Apparently he was satisfied that I would do as a tenant because he proceeded to give me the terms and conditions of tenancy.
\par <#/>"If you go along with me you'll find a very good person," he was saying, "but otherwise. <#/>" He finished with a gesture of the hand that could only, mean "you'll be given immediate notice!\rdblquote 
\par <#/>In Bandar, given the state of the housing that was no mean threat.
\par <#/>He gave me the general rules of the house about tidiness and general discipline and added two rules that I'd never heard of before.
\par <#/>One was that, if Young Blacks Sports Club wins any match against Chui Sports Club, there was to be no celebration in
 that house. <#/>'Sports' in Bongoland generally referred to soccer. <#/>Chui and Young Blacks were the top and rival football clubs in the Bongoland Super League.
\par <#/>It was said that <ea/>Mzee Ngogwe was a Chui SC <ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 mkereketwa, }{\fs24\lang2057 fanatic and one had to be careful in discussing football matters when he was around. <#/>A difference of opinion could cost one a room.
\par <#/>Another of the unique rules that Ngogwe imposed was that one was not supposed to cook exceptionally aromatic foods. <#/><ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 Kukaangiza }{\fs24\lang2057 was
 forbidden and restricted to public holidays only. <#/><Ea/>Mzee Ngogwe believed that cooking oil was highly inflammable and could set his house on fire.
\par <#/>Having lived with my brother since my graduation from Technical College and having endured my sister-in-law's arrogant and selfish attitude towards me, I was at the point of losing }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_my>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 
self-control when Moses came to me with an offer of a room. <#/>I grabbed it the way a thirsty man in the desert would grab a glass of cold water. <#/>I saw Ngogwe as a trouble maker but was prepared to put up with him.
\par <#/>"Do you have six months advance rent? <#/>" he asked. <#/>I said yes, I had come well prepared. <#/>I gave it to him.
\par <#/>I got the key to my room and I was ecstatic. <#/>The house wasn't anything to write home about but at last I had freedom. <#/>Now I could come home late, bring girlfriends, play the music I chose, etc.
\par <#/>I moved in immediately.
\par <#/>On my very first night, I had a <-/frihtening> experience. <#/>I was lying in bed, relaxed, readin
g a picture magazine, dressed only in my underwear, when something moved under the bedsheet between the naked skin of my back and the mattress. <#/>I instinctively jumped off the bed fearing that it might be a snake. <#/>The little protrusion, like a smal
l mountain moved rapidly across the bed and fell off at the end and immediately I saw that it was a furry rodent that quickly ran into a hole in the wall to take cover.
\par <#/>Even as I stood there, another one ran across the roofing framework on the unceilinged roof. <#/>The house was full of them.
\par <#/>For the lucky ones of you who might be familiar with the }{\i\fs24\lang2057 Tom and Jerry }{\fs24\lang2057 cartoons or }{\i\fs24\lang2057 Mickey Mouse, }{\fs24\lang2057 
this animal might seem endearing. <#/>I assure you that it is not. <#/>If I were the Creator, I would confine this pest to the video screens and cartoon books to make the earth a happier place for mankind.
\par <#/>I found it hell to live in the same house with mice. <#/>They ate food, they ate clothes, they ate wood, and made disgusting noises whilst doing so. <#/>I spent
 sleepless nights listening to their chatter and industrious and destructive activity. <#/>Even my productivity in the machine shop at work deteriorated.
\par <#/>Mice were getting on my nerves and I declared a <-/full scale> war against them. <#/>In this, I was hindered by a number of factors.
\par <#/>First, I avoided the use of poison because it might harm the 'innocent civilian population', the children of my neighbours. <#/>I could not afford the risk.
\par <#/>Second, traps had little effect because the mice in Ngogwe's house had all attended Advanced Trap Avoidance Courses. <#/>In this endeavour, I ended up, with two swollen fingers when one of the traps was accidentally tripped by myself.
\par <#/>Third, I did not have repatriation agreements with my neighbours who harboured these pests. <#/>The mice or rats or whatever they are called, just used <-/guerilla> tactics. <#/>They would come to my room }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct}{
\fs24\lang2057  riot and then run to the neighbouring rooms when things got too hot for them. <#/>I could not violate legitimate boundaries in my case of the enemy, so they had safe asylum everywhere in the house except in my territory.
\par <#/>So as you can see I was very handicapped. <#/>One morning I had a very bright idea and brought in a cat. <#/>I thought that would solve my problem in no time and once and for all.
\par <#/>A next room neighbour called me aside and advised me that I'd better take the cat back to wherever I'd got it from, or else I'd be in trouble; <ea/>Mzee Ngogwe did not like cats and }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\b\fs24\lang2057 /}{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 verb}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 that the old man had an allergy for cat hair.
\par <#/>By this time I was in such a state that I could have a mental breakdown }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>The gnawing teeth and small scurrying feet in the night were driving me <slang/>nuts. <#/>And to top it all I had to sweep out the droppings from the accursed rodents.
\par <#/>One day I happened to have a hammer in hand after a little DIY (do it yourself) work. <#/>A huge mouse, must have been the head of the family, scurried quickly across the corridor, <-/vectorising> for an open door
 behind me. <#/>I beat the rodent to the door and closed it. <#/>In the ensuing hunt I ended up <-/victorius> with a bloody hammer in hand. <#/>The rodent's head was crushed and the cement floor was chipped at one or two points where I had missed in the i
nitial strikes.
\par <#/>The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty To Animals might not approve, but I felt <AmE/>real good then. <#/>I cleaned up the mess and some good neighbours congratulated me <-_in><+_on> that notable achievement.
\par <#/>My joy was short <-_live><+_lived>. <#/>The following day Ngogwe summoned me and warned me that I should not stain the floor of his house with blood as that would bring bad luck, <ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 mkosi, }{\fs24\lang2057 
upon it. <#/>He had noticed the stain on the floor and one of the tenants had told him how it had got there. <#/>I'm sure now that if he had noticed the chipped floor where I had hit with the hammer, then it would have been }{\i\fs24\lang2057 Adios }{
\fs24\lang2057 to my room! <#/>.
\par <#/>To me that was the last straw. <#/>I had to find another house. <#/>Ngogwe alone was manageable. <#/>Mice alone I could fight. <#/>But a combination of Mice and Ngogwe I could not take! <#/>I simply had to move.
\par <#/>After a month of intensive and continuous search by myself, Moses and a number of sympathetic friends, I got a room in a house built on }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
 the lowland valleys; such was the congestion of housing plots in Bandar.
\par <#/>A month after I'd moved in, the rainy season started. <#/>It rained intensively and continuously and things started to get very bad.
\par <#/>I had to wade into and out of the house. <#/>I had to put bricks on the legs of the bed to elevate it above the floods. <#/>Cooking stoves had to be placed on tables, otherwise the fires went out ... it was hell.
\par <#/>I'm still looking for a decent place to live. <#/>Food, shelter and clothing; the fundamental necessities. <#/>To most of us decent shelter is still an insoluble problem.</I>

\par <#/>It was an ideal place for courting couples, holiday-makers, and tourists.
\par <#/>However, all this was wasted on Cosmas Ndahiliwe. <#/>Beauty, as the saying goes, is in the eyes of the beholder }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>idiom}{\fs24\lang2057  and Cosm
as was in no mood to be aesthetic. <#/>His defeatist attitude poised his general outlook of the world. <#/>To him everything appeared <-_to pay-turvy><+_topsy-turvy>.
\par <#/>A few metres above him, on the embankment, life was going on as usual. <#/>The mid-morning traffic was sparse on this <-/sea side> boulevard, with an occasional car heading either way, but Cosmas was hardly aware of the fact.
\par <#/>The <-_pedestrians><+_pedestrians'> pavement was virtually deserted. <#/>Cosmas had indeed chosen well the spot
 to accomplish the eerie mission he had in desperation set for himself. <#/>During week-days the beach was an ideal solitary place for someone with the inclination to become temporarily a recluse.
\par <#/>He walked along the beach, tasting the salty air as he took in air and breathed out. <#/>He tried to summon enough strength to accomplish his resolution which was what had brought him to the beach.
\par <#/>When he reached the weather-beaten concrete beach, he seemed to have mustered enough determination to start the process which would fulfil his resolve.
\par <#/>As he sat on the concrete bench he untied his shoelaces and kicked off his shoes. <#/>He then took off the thread-bare pair of socks from his feet and stuffed them into the shoes. <#/>He pushed the shoes under the concrete bench and stood up.
\par <#/>He paused for a moment, contemplating <-_on> what to do next. <#/>He had now reached the decisive stage in the whole business, a litmus test of the strength of his conviction in his resolution.
\par <#/>Should he take off h
is clothes as well? <#/>He was quick to discard the idea. <#/>He would look queer indeed to the occasional passers-by in his underpants at that time of the day and on that day of the week. <#/>The spot was not the usual resort for swimmers. <#/>No, he wou
ld not take off his clothes.
\par <#/>That the idea to take off his clothes had even occurred to him, was the weak point in his armour. <#/>It was a clear sign of vacillation. <#/>It showed that deep underneath he lacked that inner resolve needed to see him thro
ugh his mission. <#/>Had he been resolute there would not have been any need for him to dither. <#/>Why worry about wetting your clothes if you were really determined to take the final plunge?
\par <#/>He headed towards the sea and began wading step by step.
\par <#/>What circumstances had led to Cosmas's mid morning desperation?
\par <#/>It all started some five years ago, when he had decided to take that crucial step that separates men from boys and confirms one to be a <-/full fledged> adult.
\par <#/>He had decided to leave the <-_bachelor's><+_bachelors'> club. <#/>It was at this time that he had started to take decisive steps to join the marrieds' club that the idea had <-_reminded><+_remained> mooted }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{
\fs24\lang2057  in his mind for quite a long time.
\par <#/>Being the first born 
in a family of four boys and four girls, the dice had been cast against the smooth accomplishment of his ambition right from the very beginning. <#/>It had to do with the shaky background, devoid of love, in which his father, Christopher Ndalihiwe, had be
en brought up almost half a century before.
\par <#/>Ever since he was six months old, young Christopher was brought up first by a step-mother and afterwards by foster parents. <#/>His mother had died when he was at that tender age. <#/>He was thereafter brought
 up by a stepmother. <#/>His father, Cosmas' grandfather, had married for a second time. <#/>He was thus deprived of maternal affection at the most delicate stage of his formative years.
\par <#/>When young Christopher was of school-age he received another psychological blow. <#/>His village, Kidahwe, had no primary school. <#/>The nearest school built by missionaries was at Bugaga some 50 kilometres away.
\par <#/>So it was arranged that he should stay with very distant relatives while attending school.
\par <#/>So, young Christopher attended school under the guardianship of alien parents, and in the companionship of rather hostile distant kith and kin.
\par <#/>Although his new <-_guardian><+_guardians> did their best to be kind to him, they were nevertheless a poor substitute to the warmth he would have got from those with whom he had a blood bond.
\par <#/>To compound this his father had shifted from Kidahwe to Nyamnyusi, a new settlement deep in the forest where the land was still virgin. <#/>The place was inaccessible and ill-s
uited to normal family life. <#/>This was a severe disadvantage to children.
\par <#/>The result of this upbringing was that young Christopher grew into adulthood an oddly-complex individual. <#/>He had left school at standard ten and joined the civil service. 
<#/>He worked through the ranks to attain the position of considerable authority as a district natural resources officer.
\par <#/>While occupying this rather exalted position, Christopher had every opportunity to consolidate his standing among his peers. <#/>Many people came to see him at his office or even at his home to ask for his assistance.
\par <#/>Instead of taking this opportunity to make himself indispensable, Christopher only succeeded to alienate himself from the vast majority of those seeking his help in
cluding relatives and close friends - by refusing to concern himself with their problems.
\par <#/>Only the most unabashed sycophants and some well-to-do individuals who could in one way or another repay his favours benefited from his good offices.
\par <#/>This earned him a succinct if blunt and unflattering assessment of his character by one of his subordinates as "cold-hearted and self centred hard-core cynic.\rdblquote 
\par <#/>This callousness extended even to his own children to whom he was particularly brusque. <#/>There was no rational explanation for this except that this might have been the outcome of the deprivations he had suffered as a child. <#/>It looked as if he 
was unconsciously making <-_the> society pay back for the humiliation he had been subjected to.
\par <#/>The first time Cosmas Ndalihiwe bore the full brunt of his father's insensitivity was when he had become betrothed to Gloria Karadyoshe.
\par <#/>At that time Cos
mas was working in the city as a storekeeper at the National Grain Marketing Board (NGMB) headquarters, after completing his studies at the College of Business Education in Dar es Salaam and qualifying for a Diploma in materials management some five years
 back.
\par <#/>He tried to enlist his father's help at raising funds required for marriage. <#/>Sadly, Christopher disassociated himself from Cosmas' endeavours. <#/>This unsavoury decision was difficult to ignore because it had a destructive effect to the fund
 raising initiatives jointly undertaken by Cosmas and his mother, Rita.
\par <#/>Christopher's dictatorial attitude at home also made the atmosphere unconducive to translating the fund raising initiatives into actualities. <#/>On top of that, Christopher shirke
d, whenever he could do so, from the fundamental responsibilities for the upkeep of his family. <#/>Therefore he made it necessary for Rita, who was working as a primary school teacher, to fill the vacuum, }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct}{\fs24\lang2057 
 Christopher thus created.
\par <#/>To make ma
tters worse, Christopher refused even to <-_land><+_lend> his moral assistance to <-_Cosmas><+_Cosmas'> endeavours. <#/>Out of sympathy for Cosmas whom he saw had been forced to act solo as an orphan, Cosmas' uncle Cosmas Naraso volunteered to deputize fo
r Christopher as the go-between with the Karadyoshe clan.
\par <#/>The whole process was extremely slow, taking almost three years. <#/>Things seemed to gain momentum only when Cosmas was home during his annual leave when he could dedicate his full energy to the matter.

\par <#/>"The day before yesterday I gave you a lot of money for groceries but today you are telling me that there is no sugar, what have }{\b\v\fs24 <+_you>}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 done with that money? <#/>" her husband would angrily say.
\par <#/>"Oh my God what shall I do to make you understand? <#/>Prices have gone up so I bought half a kilogram of sugar my }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>orth}{\fs24 
 Husband," she would plead with him. <#/>Even though her husband would dismiss all those explanations as lies.
\par <#/>"It's nice to talk because you're not working. <#/>Other women are helping their husbands, while you're just sitting like a queen, I'm tired of you," the husband would }{\b\v\fs24 <+_say> }{\fs24 in a voice shaking with anger as he gives }{\b\v\fs24 
<&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24  money to Lucy.
\par <#/><ea/>Mama Lucy was one of those women who besides going to the <ea/>sha
mba, would just sit the whole day decorating themselves. <#/>When other women were coming together for projects like poultry <-_farm><+_farming>, she would be a customer who unfortunately buys on credit depending on her <-_husbands><+_husband's> salary.

\par <#/>"<ea/>Mama Lucy, you're our good customer. <#/>Many people buy our chicken on credit but when we need our money we've to run after them, keep it up," a sales woman would comment.
\par <#/>Indeed in those early days, her husband never bothered whether one kilogram of sugar could take }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24 
 two days or less because commodities were cheap, but now everything is expensive and <ea/>mama Lucy's social and economic life is <-_in><+_at> stake.
\par <#/>Everyday her husband, besides complaining about her carelessness in using money, was developing some new habits. <#/>He would come home drunk and make a lot of noise. <#/>Sometimes he would not turn up at the end of a day }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{
\b\fs24 /}{\b\v\fs24 connection}{\fs24  come back the following day very drunk. <#/>Above all he was threatening to leave her with her eight children.
\par <#/><ea/>Mama Lucy became very thin. <#/>She did not know what to do to restore her family's comfort, peace and love. <#/>Day and night she was restless in mind. <#/>To her, that was a time when she was mostly in need of her husband.
\par <#/>One day the radio announced that pupils <-_will><+_would> have to share school costs with the government. <#/>They had four kids in primary school. <#/>At that time it was two months before schools were reopening and unfortunately one of th
e kids fell very sick. <#/>She took him to hospital where to her surprise }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar/subject}{\fs24  was told that all services that offered by the hospital }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 are paid for. <#/>When she got back home her husband told her that there was no money.
\par <#/>"I have told you to look for a job. <#/>I know you may think I am drunk because I have taken some beer with all the money I had. <#/>That is not true, my friends bought it for me," said the drunk husband.
\par <#/>Had it not been because of a certain widow who was her <AmE/>neighbor, the moon was down }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>idiom}{\fs24  }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24 
 for <ea/>mama Lucy. <#/>Maybe she could have stayed with the child until it died. <#/>The widow gave her some money to <-_sent><+_send> the child to the hospital. <#/>She was selling fish and fat cakes in town. <#/>That was how she was earning her life }
{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24 .
\par <#/>"You know <ea/>mama Lucy, you're too young to let life trouble you in this way. <#/>There are many things you can do to generate money for your family. <#/>Even if your husband
 was not a <slang/>boozer I don't think his salary is big enough to keep the family going," the widow said.
\par <#/>"Do you see this house I am living in, I have built it alone because my husband died }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24  long time ago. <#/>I don't like to tell you wha
t to do. <#/>I am selling fish and it is because of it that I sent all my kids to school, so please my dear never ever allow life to trouble you in this way," the widow said adding that the time <-_has><+_had> gone and that she had to rush to her work pla
ce.
\par <#/>Unfortunately three days after the widow had advised <ea/>mama Lucy, to start a project, her husband left her. <#/>He was not far, just in the same area. <#/>The husband was staying with a certain lady who was a clerical assistant at a certain compa
ny in town.
\par <#/><ea/>Mama Lucy was not used to waking up early in the morning and <-_come><+_coming> back home very late <-_is><+_in> the evening, the business of buying and selling fish was not an easy task to her at all. <#/>There was a time when she nea
rly allowed a certain man to stay with her so as to easy her life }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>idiom}{\fs24 . <#/>But her husband had made her hate men.
\par <#/>It was tough, she became thin. <#/>Some people were not even able to recognise her at a distance. <#/>The whole lot of <-/house hold> together with family decision making were fully on her <-_shoulder><+_shoulders>. <#/>She had to see to it that }{
\b\v\fs24 <+_her>}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 children <-_go><+_went> to school with all }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24  necessary requirements.
\par <#/>Indeed, in the beginning of }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24  fish selling business, she could not imagine herself running }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24  big business like a fish market which she ended up running
. <#/>Even though she was in partnership with the widow and another lady in their place, she had a satisfactory share because of }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24  little education she had.
\par <#/>She was acting as a manager therefore she changed. <#/>She became more beautiful than when she was a <-/house wife> who was depending on her <-_husbands><+_husband's> salary. <#/>It was in those days when one day she arrived home from the market, }{
\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24  to her surprise, the escaped husband was in the house which he left a decade and a half ago.
\par <#/>The man had decided to come back. <#/>However, that time he was no longer a healthy person. <#/>He was suffering from tuberculosis. <#/><ea/>Mama Lucy found him lying on her bed breathing heavily and after every minute he was coughing he looke
d like an }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>orth}{\fs24  eskimo dog. <#/>Just by his side was a lot of toilet <_papers><+_paper> which each was covering drops of blood }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  that came every time he coughed.
\par <#/>At that moment <ea/>mama Lucy became very furious. <#/>She wanted to tell him to go back where he was staying. <#/>But the widow asked her to accept him.
\par <#/>"You've got to thank this man for lifting you up where you are now. <#/>Had it not been because of him you could have stayed the poor <-/house wife> until today. <#/>I'm not s
aying what he did was good. <#/>I rather consider him a weak minded and foolish man. <#/>Forgive him, forget about the past, go on living your life," the widow convinced <ea/>mama Lucy.
\par <#/>However, the husband died after three days. <#/>Do you know what <ea/>mama Lucy did? <#/>She bought him a very expensive coffin and a very beautiful suit to cover his body on his way to heaven.</I>

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>THE four hours he had spent in the loc
k-up were beginning to take their toll <-_to><+_on> Charles Masunga, the Head Teacher of Msimamo Primary School in Kigoma Town in Western Tanzania. <#/>That the <-_reason><+_reasons> for his incarceration were not made clear to him, helped very little to 
calm the psychological turmoil he was undergoing due to the incarceration.
\par <#/>The cell in which he was solitarily confined was a dingy little room 2.5 metres by 2.5 metres with two concrete bunkers each on adjacent walls, an impregnable metal door six inch
es thick with a 60 cm square port grilled with thick round steel bars spaced 5 centimetres apart, and a corridor, providing the only view for the inmate <-_with><+_of> the outside.
\par <#/>But nothing spectacular could be observed past the port as the view in question was only the row of cells on the other side, with the exterior part of the reinforced door of the cell directly opposite, with its own barred port at the same level.

\par <#/>Perhaps the only redeeming thing that could be said of the cell was that it w
as not as dirty as Charles had expected to find it from the <-/metal>-images of a lock-up he had construed from tit-bits of information from people unfortunate enough to have <-_underwent><+_undergone> a similar experience before him. <#/>The relative cle
anliness of the cell was maybe due to the fact that he was obviously the first inmate to occupy it on that day and presumably it had been cleared during the morning time.
\par <#/>But he was not the only inmate in the remand cells. <#/>Other cells had other remandees, and as far as he could ascertain from snatches of conversations going }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_on>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 
inside them, they were on the average holding more than the four inmates each was originally designed to hold.
\par <#/>The reason that he had been accorded the dubious privileg
e of solitary confinement was because his was a very special case. <#/>He had incurred the wrath of no lesser personage than the eminent Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Israel Masharubu, who was the over-all in charge of police }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057  in Kigoma Region by virtue of his post as the Regional police Commander (RPC).
\par <#/>How come that a humble primary school master had managed to so cross paths with, and to the extent of chagrining one of the handful of personalities constituting the cream of the province? <#/>}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>orth}{\fs24\lang2057 
 An intelligent reader might ask. <#/>The answer is simple enough and can be summed }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_up>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 with <-_a><+_the> name of one single lady Mayasa Mkembe.
\par <#/>Mayasa, a sultry and voluptuous 24-year-old beauty who was in the teaching staff under Masunga's administration at the Msimamo Primary School, was Mashurubu's mistress. <#/>She had not been on the staff for }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{
\fs24\lang2057  long time compared to her compatriots }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct}{\fs24\lang2057  having graduated from the college of National Education some four years previously.
\par <#/>Born of parents hailing from Kigoma Region, Mayasa had finished Primary School at the ripe age of 15-years. <#/>Just after reaching the transitory period of adolescence into womanhood she was lucky enough to get chosen to undergo training as a
 grade IIIC teacher at Ndanda College of National Education into the neighbouring Tabora Region.
\par <#/>Her three-year-stay at Ndanda could be described as very hectic. <#/>In the most vulnerable years of her life Mayasa survived by sheer cunning the numerous
 stumps that could have earned her termination of her course. <#/>She had aborted twice mainly because (as the Kiganza grapevine had it) the co-respondents in the two cases were tutors who hastily arranged for and financed the abortion because their <-_ca
rriers><+_careers> could have otherwise been put into jeopardy.
\par <#/>But well, that is neither here nor there. <#/>Upon graduation, Mayasa was posted <-_as><+_to> Msimamo for her first appointment. <#/>Initially she stayed with her uncle who worked at the Ra
ilway Station but not for long. <#/>With her instincts for survival, nurtured and honed by her experiences at Ndanda, she had managed to win the attention of, and arouse the <-_list><+_lust> for her in the <-/middle aged> provincial police chief's soul.

\par <#/>Under the patronage of the obsessed RPC, Mayasa managed to acquire living quarters of her own in a four-room house owned by the Roman Catholic Mission at Ujiji which were also comfortably furnished by the former.
\par <#/>With the flourishing of her razzle-da
zzle affair with one of the most powerful and influential men in the region Mayasa was also by proxy one of the most powerful and influential women in the region. <#/>She could, depending on her inclination, open doors of opportunity to her close friends 
and relative, or close them in the case of her adversaries and foes. <#/>With this acquired power came the arrogant streak that led her to show open disrespect towards her immediate superior Charles Masunga, the Head Teacher of Msimamo Primary School.

\par <#/>M
asunga had tried several times to make her change her behaviour especially when it directly affected her teaching duties as she was prone to sometimes abandon a class midway through a lesson if and when Masharubu had happened to <-_chose><+_choose> such a
 time to send his driver to pick her }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_up>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 
at the school for a rendezvous. <#/>Eventually he was left with no alternative but to write a strongly worded reprimand which he copied to the Kigoma Ujiji Town Council (KUTC) Education authorities.
\par <#/
>It was this letter that had earned him a four hour stay <-_at><+_in> the remand cell - immediately after getting the letter, a sobbing Mayasa had taken it to Masharubu and accused Masunga of being prejudiced against her. <#/>This had so angered Masharubu
 that he sent his subordinates to go and pick the poor school-<-_maser><+_master> and bring him to the Central Police Station, where he was bundled into a cell for four hours, before Masharubu was ready to grill him in his office.
\par <#/>The harassed school-te
acher, eventually decided to apologize to Masharubu though he could hardly see <-_that><+_what> he had done to warrant such a plea. <#/>But even then the RPC did not intend to let him off lightly. <#/>He told him to withdraw the reprimand he had given May
asa, and then publicly apologize to her during the afternoon parade, before pupils were dismissed.
\par <#/>Masunga found these conditions too humiliating to accept and said so. <#/>Masharubu could not hold him further as he had committed no crime and reluctantl
y released him. <#/>But that was not to be the end of the affair. <#/>Two weeks afterwards Masunga received a letter from KUTC education authorities informing him he was being transferred to a primary school at Tongwe, a remote village in one of the most 
i
naccessible parts of the province. <#/>He reported to his new station a fortnight later, a victim of Masharubu's <-/peccadiloes>. <#/>He realised that as a headteacher he was merely a toothless bulldog, and could not impose his will on his subordinates wh
o had god-fathers in positions or real power.</I>

\par <#/>I was given the chance to

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>PREGNANCY can be a dirty word to some people. <#/>To others, the word pregnancy can be the most beautiful word ever created on this earth.
\par <#/>Let me introduce myself. <#/>My name is Suzi Moto, a humble young ordinary looking secretary in a certain parastatal in Dar es Salaam. <#/>I have worked for this company for the past three years.
\par <#/>So where did I fall that day when I found myself pregnant for the first time. <#/>Here I was looking at the r
esults of my urine test. <#/>It was stamped in bright purple ink 'POSITIVE'. <#/>I could not believe it, no, there had to be a mistake, maybe the urine samples were confused. <#/>}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct}{\fs24\lang2057 
 I thought. <#/>When I asked the laboratory technician who did the test if the results were correct, he laughed.
\par <#/>"Of course it is correct, Congratulations! <#/>", he said and even offered me a handshake.
\par <#/>"Mmmh... <#/>" I mumbled in dismay as the <slang/>congrats hit me like a tonne of bricks. <#/>I did not accept the handshake but turned around and went out of the laboratory.
\par <#/>"My God, what am I going to do now? <#/>How did it happen? <#/>Why, Why me! <#/>" were just some of the thoughts that raced through my mind over and over again. <#/>I left the hospital in a <-/dace>.
\par <#/>I do not know how I did it, but somehow I managed to find my way to my little rented room in Magomeni which to me is quite <-/cozy>.
\par <#/>There I guess my best friend and neighbour, Sara, noticed how down I looked when I walked into the corridor of the six room }{\i\fs24\lang2057 Swahili}{\fs24\lang2057  type house.
\par <#/>"Hey, what is wrong, did someone die? <#/>" Sara asked me.
\par <#/>"No, no one is dead, I just had an injection of chloroquine at the hospital. <#/>I have malaria. <#/>" I said.
\par <#/>"Oh, that explains why you have been <-/vomitting> in the mornings <-_there><+_these> past few days, I thought you were pregnant. <#/>" Sara joked.
\par <#/>I was not amused. <#/>Sara noting that I had been disturbed, offered to prepare lunch for me. <#/>I refused. <#/>She offered to go for soft drinks from a nearby kiosk. <#/>I again refused, telling her that I would accept the offer another day.
\par <#/>With that, I opened my room, went in, closed the door behind me gently, then I threw myself on my bed, crying.
\par <#/>"What am I going to do, this is the worst thing that could happen to me, especially now," I thought to myself.
\par <#/>You see, I am engaged to a handsome young man, Aristo Motala, who is away in Europe studying to be a pilot. <#/>He had been gone for the past eight months and would not be back for another eight. <#/>There was no way that I could call, }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct}{\fs24\lang2057  Aristo, the father of my child. <#/>I had disgraced myself even though I had tried to remain faithful to Aristo. <#/>I wondered whether I should seek an abortion or just go ahead and
 have the child. <#/>I decided that the only way to solve the problem was to confront the father of the child. <#/>He was Sara's <-/finance>, Marco. <#/>Marco was also my immediate supervisor at work.
\par <#/>Believe me, it was not my fault, it was entirely his!
\par <#/>Oh, how I regret that night. <#/>I had had one beer too many and a few <-_totes><+_tots> of <ea/>Konyagi as well. <#/>I usually do not drink but that night I did. <#/>I had no strength to resist. <#/>Sara, }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct}{
\fs24\lang2057  had gone to Tanga for a funeral.
\par <#/>It was an office party. <#/>We were saying good-bye to <ea/>Mzee Ramadhani, who had been a faithful driver to the General Manager for the past ten years. <#/>He was now retiring after working for the company for the past 30 years, working his way beca
use I really respected <ea/>Mzee Ramadhani }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>sense}{\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>When the party was over, Marco offered to take me home in his car. <#/>I agreed, after all I felt safe with him because he was my }{\i\fs24\lang2057 '<ea/>shemeji'}{\fs24\lang2057  (in-law) and I thought that he could not do anything to me.
\par <#/>Well, I was wrong. <#/><ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 Shemeji}{\fs24\lang2057 
 meant nothing to him. <#/>He was drunk. <#/>Instead of taking me home, he took me to his flat at Ubungo. <#/>You know what happened after that, but I assure you that I was unwilling.
\par <#/>So, I found myself pregnant with Marco's child. <#/>What could I do? <#/>How could I tell Sara, should I tell Sara? <#/>I was confused, I cried myself to sleep.
\par <#/>In the morning I was sick as usual but I managed to get dressed and go to work. <#/><-/Thank-God> there was office transport.
\par <#/>The mini-bus stopped at the Magomeni Bus Stop. <#/>I got in. <#/>There was Marco, sitting in the back seat. <#/>My heart almost stopped. <#/>I recovered though and managed to find a seat and sit down.
\par <#/>Marco was telling jokes as usual. <#/>The other workers in the bus just laughed. <#/>The jokes had no meaning to me now. <#/>I stared out }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_of>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 the bus window as we drove t
hrough Jangwani into the City Centre. <#/>The babies on women's backs, the school children struggling to get transport had new meaning to me now that I was in the family way.
\par <#/>The twenty minute trip to the office seemed like eternity. <#/>The first thing I did in the office that day was to go to the toilet, to be sick. <#/>When I felt better I stopped by Marco's office.
\par <#/>He was sitting at his desk. <#/>His office mate had not arrived. <#/>I was glad. <#/>I thought that I could talk to him even more freely.
\par <#/>"Marco, do you remember the night that you forced me to sleep at your flat? <#/>" I asked him.
\par <#/>"What, you my <ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 shemeji}{\fs24\lang2057  slept at my house, when Sara was away at a funeral? <#/>Is it possible? <#/>What will people think? <#/>what will Sara t
hink? <#/>Let us just forget that it ever happened... <#/>Marco said in a cool eerie voice.
\par <#/>"Marco please, let us be serious. <#/>" I pleaded. <#/>"Serious about what? <#/>he asked, his forehead wrinkled a bit. <#/>"I am pregnant by you and I need your advice. <#/>" I managed to say.
\par <#/>"What pregnant by me. <#/>You slept at my flat only once, are you crazy, get out of here, you whore! <#/>" he shouted. <#/>I could not believe that it was the same Marco. <#/>I ran out of his office terrified because I 
had never seen him so angry before. <#/>I rushed to the toilet where I was sick again. <#/>My head reeled as the meaning of what had just happened, sank in. <#/>I felt faint.
\par <#/>Instead of working that day, I took a sick sheet, went to the doctor and got a four day ED. <#/>After presenting it to the Department Manager, and telling him that I had a bad case of malaria, he ordered a driver to take me home. <#/>I was grateful.

\par <#/>When I reached home, Sara was not there, luckily. <#/>She had not yet returned 
from her many business ventures. <#/>Whenever she could she avoided sleeping at Magomeni and slept at Marco's, her future home. <#/>Their love for each other seemed to grow each day.
\par <#/>I could not bear the thought of facing Sara even though I knew I eventually would have to. <#/><-/Afterall>, she was my best friend. <#/>I found myself crying again.
\par <#/>My landlady was kind, she saw me sick that day and brought me <ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 ugali }{\fs24\lang2057 and <ea/>}{\i\fs24\lang2057 kisamvu}{\fs24\lang2057  (ground cassava leaves) to eat. <#/>I was thankful and realised h
ow hungry I was. <#/>I ate all the food. <#/>When the landlady came to collect the bowls, she asked to sit down and talk to me. <#/>I agreed.
\par <#/>"My dear, what is bothering you? <#/>" she asked.
\par <#/>"I have malaria. <#/>" I said.
\par <#/>The landlady laughed. <#/>My dear do you think that I do not know these things. <#/>I can see that you are pregnant. <#/>You cannot fool me.
\par <#/>I was shocked, how could she know when my belly had not started to show yet. <#/>I asked her how she knew. <#/>She said that my skin had turned glossy and my mouth had darkened, while my eating habits had changed.
\par <#/>I felt really bad and wondered how many others suspected that I was pregnant. <#/>The landlady left me alone. <#/>I started crying again. <#/>My tears dried up and I began to whimper like a puppy.
\par <#/>Marco had denied the child which was certainly his. <#/>It was not the child's fault that it was conceived. <#/>But, how could I give birth to a child with no father, or least one whose father did not want her. <#/>I never kn
ew my father and did not want a fatherless child.
\par <#/>Having the child would mean that I would lose my <-/fiance>, Aristo. <#/>It meant that I would disgrace my mother's family which was the only family I knew. <#/>I had sworn to them that I would not have
 a child out of wedlock but that was what was happening.
\par <#/>"Should I have the child, or should I terminate it. <#/>" I was in a dilemma, my head ached. <#/>I fell asleep. <#/>I dreamt that my best friend, Sara, had tied me to a stake and had poured petro
l on the pile of dry sticks that I was standing on. <#/>As she was about to light it, I woke up.
\par <#/>I realised that it was a dream and went back to sleep. <#/>This time I dreamt that I had given birth to a child with two heads, one looked like Marco, the 
other me. <#/>Sara was beating the head that looked like me with a club. <#/>I shouted for her to stop, but no sound came from my mouth, again I woke up.
\par <#/>That evening, I went to a hospital, and talked to a nurse friend of mine. <#/>She told me that abo
rtion was illegal which I already knew. <#/>She said however, that there was a doctor who would do it for 8,000/-. <#/>I asked her to arrange it for me, knowing that I would have to dip into my savings to pay for it.
\par <#/>Before I went for the abortion, I went to church to confess my sins. <#/>I recited the prayers that the priest told me to. <#/>I felt guilty at not telling him that I was actually going to commit murder.
\par <#/>After the abortion and another one week ED, I was back to work. <#/>I was my cheerful old self on the outside, but inside I was a guilty being. <#/>I learned a lesson though.
\par <#/>Sara, gets married to Marco, next Sunday. <#/>I did not get a wedding invitation. <#/>I did not tell her about the pregnancy or the encounter with Marco. <#/>Bu
t Marco, in an effort to ward off problems told her that I was trying to sleep with him. <#/>That ended my friendship with Sara and she moved out of the house at Magomeni and went to live with Marco.
\par <#/>Oh well, I am waiting for Aristo to return. <#/>I hope he does not find out what happened. <#/>But believe me, I have learned a lesson. <#/>Never trust a man who claims to be }{\i\fs24\lang2057 '<ea/>shemeji'}{\fs24\lang2057 .</I>

\par <#/>The realisation of what

\par <#/>I expected a <-/sever> reprimand, but instead he unburdened himself to me, because he had no one to listen to his heavy grieving heart.
\par <#/>"I am not a hero for I don't want to die. <#/>But I am not afraid of death. <#/>My oath says: 'Save lives as a doctor come what may.'
\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 'If I have to die so that others may live, I am prepared to give my life - life which I love and treasure so much". <#/>He said this simply and slowly.
\par <#/>How petty, how selfish were my reasons compared to his lofty and altruistic values. <#/>That is why I wanted to be near him, to touch him, to be his companion in life, for better or worse in work, love, life; till the end of time.

\par <#/>Oh, the hugging and heaving,
\par the clinging and clutching,
\par the pressing and the squeezing ....
\par <#/>For me it was soaring pleasure and stinging pain.
\par <#/>Perhaps nature was kind for gravity just unshackled us and we floated, fresh and free soaring from one end of the horizon to another, - endless horizons where time and space seemed to merge into one. <#/>Surely this must be supreme happiness.
\par <#/>There was no time to discuss whether what we have done was right or wrong }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24 . <#/>What right had the deserters from duty to judge those who stayed behind.
\par <#/>I cannot with honesty say that I satisfied him. <#/>After all it was on the rebound that I got hold of him. <#/>His wife Sonia not only left him in his hour of need but was brutal and vicious with her ugly parting words: <#/>"

\par <#/>But with me it was different. <#/>I was all aglow. <#/>My body tingling, eyes glistening and hands vibrating. <#/>I walked with agile footsteps

\par <#/>And at the end of it, his face now serene he would say "well it was a good day." <#/>
There were small victories when a patient was discharged - victory because he had turned a sick person into a healthy one. <#/>And in a <-/philosphpical> note he would tell his grateful patients: "I am the captai

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>CONSTANCE Blondie who was employed as an announcer with the world service of th
e Voice of the United Kingdom (VUK) used to get an <-/everage> of five letters a week from admiring listeners all over the world, and at least two among these were from some lovelorn souls who infatuated with her sweet voice as transmitted into their radi
o sets were expressing fervent wishes to marry her.
\par <#/>It was then indeed ironic that she should have been the one to initiate the correspondence with Carlos Byantanye who was at the time being held at the Mabuye Correctional Centre as a prisoner of conscience in the Abatwele Archipelago hundred of miles 
}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  off the coast into the Atlantic Ocean.
\par <#/>Carlos' name and his plight first came to Blondie's attention in the course of discharging her duties. <#/>He was among the myriad of <-_prisoners'><+_
prisoners> of conscience from all over the world, whom the world-wide human-rights activists grouped under the auspices of the Amnesty International were campaigning for their release }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>He was also among the dozen or so <-_much><+_many> prisoners whom the VUK was proposing the highlight of their plight }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 to the world at large in a series of six minutes radio programme so as to rally the listening public to pressurize by letters the respective governments of the prisoners into releasing them immediately.
\par <#/>Carlos Byantanye was a nephew of a former Minister for Public Security in the deposed government which had fallen in a bloody coup-d'etat that had installed into power a military government in the Archipelago. <#/>The minister him
self, as was the case for most other members of the cabinet in the fallen administration; had fled into exile with his immediate family, <-_living><+_leaving> his distant relative prey to the vengeful retribution of the present leadership.
\par <#/>He had been rounded up }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057 
 together with the other unfortunate kith and kin of the exiled politicians immediately after the new strongman had taken control of all key points in the Archipelago and detained in the maximum security Mabuye correctional centre.
\par <#/>He had been languishing for more than a year in the centre before being the focus of the AI campaign and arousing the interest of Blondie when his name and curriculum vitae came <-_into><+_to> her attention.
\par <#/>The 30 year-old news reader had, by all accounts, }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24\lang2057  a successful seven years, }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct}{\fs24\lang2057 
 public career as broadcaster, but nothing glowing could be said about her private life. <#/>She was the youngest of the two children (both females) of Mr. Marcus and Mrs. Sheila Blondie, who were
 unfortunately drowned at sea, when a pleasure boat they had boarded capsized leaving no survivors. <#/>Constance was thirteen years old at the time and Nancy her sister was twenty years old.
\par <#/>The elder sister was at the time a junior at the Hopthins University and in a self-sacrificial move, Nancy had decided to leave school and look around for employment, so as to give her young sister }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057 
 chance to acquire at least as much as the formal education as she had <AmE/>gotten.
\par <#/>Her salary was eno
ugh to barely cater for their basic needs, so by the time Connie went through high school, Nancy found that the insurance, stocks and annuities left to them as inheritance from their deceased parents were all gone. <#/>So that had to be the end of the roa
d <-_far><+_for> Connie as far as formal Education was concerned.
\par <#/>She landed <-_into><+_in> <-_the> broadcasting work by sheer accident, but diligently worked her way until she was promoted to become a news reader. <#/>But she had an unhappy love-life.
\par <#/>She had been unlucky enough that the first man she had fallen in love with had been cold-hearted and totally ruthless, who used women and when he felt they had served his purpose discarded them like a used tube of toothpaste.
\par <#/>This shattering experience to }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  the starry-eyed ex-schoolgirl just about to embark }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057 
 in the career-world, doused all the romantic fire that had been boiling in her blood-veins. <#/>As a result when she did start her career she was totally immersed in it, and vow
ed to have nothing to do with men again to avoid the repetition of the heart-rending cessation <-_for><+_of> her first ever love-affair. <#/>But that was before she came across the life-history of Carlos Byantanye.
\par <#/>Here was a young-man (he was 18-years old when detained) who was definitely suffering from the sins of others.
\par <#/>Her heart bled for him. <#/>She was determined to do all in her capability to intensify the campaign for his release, and in the meantime, started correspondence directly to him.
\par <#/>Her first three tentative letters had gone un-replied before her fourth letter was rewarded with a response direct from Carlos, in his own handwriting from the correctional centre.
\par <#/>Apparently her first thre
e letters had not reached him. <#/>She was gratified by this, and somehow manipulated her superiors at the VUK into giving her a special assignment into the Archipelago to where she flew as soon as the formality and arrangements for the trip were finalize
d.
\par <#/>She lodged at a beach hotel in Kwisenga }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct}{\fs24\lang2057  the sprawling capital of the Archipelago, from where she again wrote to Carlos and received his reply six days later.
\par <#/>Then with the help of the staff at her country's embassy, (and with some bribe
ry involved with several high-ranking authorities at the correctional centre) she had arranged that Carlos be transferred to a private hospital in Kwisenga after the requisite recommendations from the prison doctor, who was of course among the recipients 
<-_to><+_of> the largesse she had distributed. <#/>There at the private room in the hospital, they had managed to see one another in the flesh, and although the room was under twenty-four hour guard, they were always left alone when she visited him.

\par <#/>Her
 desire to set Carlos free was now given fresh impetus by these private meetings with him, and she had again used the embassy to pressurize the military leadership into agreeing to release him on the condition that he be immediately exiled, which was what
 Connie had been wanting all along.
\par <#/>Her perseverance was rewarded as she flew from the Kwisenga International Airport three weeks after she had landed there with her hard-won prize, Carlos Byantanye, on the seat next to her throughout the journey to the United Kingdom.
\par <#/>There were married at a registry office, four weeks after their arrival in the <-/Uk>, and one hopes, they will live happily thereafter.</I>

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 IT was a hot dusty day, in Dar es Salaam, when Luther Simon, told his fiancee, Pamela Johnathan, that their engagement was broken off. <#/>The words hit Pamela stronger than a blow from a heavyweight boxer.
\par <#/>Pamela had only been released from hospital t

\par <#/>Pamela, had expected that her multi-millionaire fiancee Luther would foot the bill, but now that he broke off the engagement }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24  that would not be possible.
\par <#/>The accident occurred one rainy day along Old Bagamoyo road in A

 earlier in the day and Pamela drove her car, a brand new Mercedes Benz 1995 make with a registration number TZH 007. <#/>Pamela, was a rough, uncaring driver who would drive through puddles splashing dirty water on tired pedestrians. <#/>It was a habit t

\par <#/>Josephine had met Pamela, the day before in the City Centre along Samora Avenue. <#/>Pamela offered her friend lunch at a luxury restaurant. <#/>They did not meet or talk much now that Pamela was upper class.

\par <#/>Josephine, }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24  was in tears, but
 Pamela just left and hopped into her Benz and drove off. <#/>Pamela decided to visit her widowed aunt in Sinza. <#/>She hated driving through what she called slum areas as they polluted her car and ruined her eyesight. <#/>She was going to see her aunt o

\par <#/>Aunt Susana, was the wife of her uncle who paid her <-/schoolfees> during her time of need, when her own father had shamelessly abandoned his family, in <AmE/>favor of a younger woman, when she was only in Form One. <#/>Without t

\par <#/>Pamela\rquote s mother was illiterate and had gone crazy after her husband abandoned her, }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24  she
 died shortly afterwards. <#/>That was six years ago. <#/>Now Pamela, had quit her job as a receptionist in a private company so that she could prepare to be a rich man\rquote s wife. <#/>She was thrilled that she would never have to work again.
\par <#/>Aunt Susana, }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24  warned Pamela, }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24  not to get married so soon, and strive for higher education. <#/>But, with Luther in her hands, Pamela, }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24 
 thought she was at the top of the world. <#/>Pamela, }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24  left her aunt 5,000/- out of the 200,000/- that Luther had given her for pocket money that day.
\par <#/>Pamela was not really happy about having to give her aunt money, even though she knew she was in need. <#/>Giving people money made her feel like she was throwing it in }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24  dustbin. <#/>Wouldn
't it be better to buy some expensive fabrics, or some <-/ready made> clothes, or imported shoes, to add to her already vast collection? <#/>}{\b\v\fs24 <&/>orth}{\fs24  She thought.
\par <#/>Her aunt must have known what she was thinking, "I have never asked you to pay me back ev

\par <#/>Pamela apologized and got up to leave. <#/>She offered her aunt another 5,000/-, }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24  her aunt accepted the money.
\par <#/>So, the next day when she came from her shopping trip, Pamela, was deep in thought and driving at high speed, when her car skidded <-/nd> overturned. <#/>It 
was just the turn around the corner near the Drive-In Cinema, when she thought she saw a pack of dogs and cats run in front of her. <#/>The number was so great that she stepped on the brakes and the car skidded. <#/>At the same time she thought she heard 
the sound of laughing }{\i\fs24 'Swahili'}{\fs24  women and saw the road open up in front of her and her luxury Benz fell inside. <#/>She screamed as loud as she could out of fright.
\par <#/>And the luxurious car turned over again crushing her legs }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>punct}{\fs24  smashing the tinted glasses and the twisted metals cut up her beautiful face and neck.
\par <#/>Pamela survived the accident only because those she considered to be poor and stinking pulled her out of the wreck before the luxury car exploded.

\par <#/>My young man was quiet and looked thoughtful. <#/>I didn\rquote t dare disturb him although I felt like making conversation several times.
\par <#/>The car screeched to a halt near some fl
ats which I had never seen before. <#/>I was fairly familiar with the campus, though. <#/>I had been to the University several times, always at night, of course. <#/>However, these flats were definitely new and strange.
\par <#/>My host opened the door for me and, saying <ea/>}{\i\fs24 Karibu}{\fs24 , led me into a small flat..
\par <#/>The place was completely unorganised. <#/>Books were lying all over the place. <#/>Crumbs of bread and rice lay on the dining table while mango and onion <-_peels><+_peel> uneasily rubbed shoulders on 
the dirty cooker. <#/>Unwashed dishes were all heaped together in the sink.
\par <#/>The walls of the room were bare and naked. <#/>The only decoration on the walls was a big portrait of some white, fierce-looking, thickly bearded man whom I didn\rquote t know nor cared to know.
\par <#/>This single room was no doubt multi-purpose: dining, living, sleeping and kitchen, all in one.
\par <#/>"Would you care for some coffee? <#/>\rdblquote  the young man, whom I could now see properly for the first time, asked.
\par <#/>"No, thank you," I said as I surveyed him from top to bottom. <#/>The man was slim and handsome, 
\par rather shabbily dressed. <#/>His shirt was hanging out of his trousers and his <-_vest><+_feet> were only halfshod with his open, unpolished sandals. <#/>My <-/youngman> looked as unorganised and uncouth as his room.
\par <#/>"May I use your toilet", I asked.
\par <#/>"It\rquote s just round the corner," he said and threw himself onto a long couch near the big bookshelf.
\par <#/>Picking up my sling bag I disappeared into the washing room.
\par <#/>Without wasting time I undressed, took a quick shower and massaged my teeth with }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>orth}{\b\fs24  }{\fs24 
colgate to get rid of the odour of the beer. <#/>I carefully hung my underclothes behind the door and wrapped myself in my host's towel whose edges I neatly tied in a loose knot just above my breasts.
\par <#/>Forcing a broad smile on my face, I stepped out of the washing room. <#/>To my utter surprise and disgust, the
 man was still lying on the couch and reading a book. <#/>I wondered if he realised at all that I was ready. <#/>But the possibility of losing him and going home penniless forced me to drop all formalities. <#/>I walked straight towards him, sat on his <-
_laps><+_lap> and started caressing his cheeks with my lips. <#/>To my surprise and shock, the man gently pushed me aside and stood up. <#/>He was now standing near the window looking out into <-/nothingless> for it was pitch dark outside.
\par <#/>"You see... er... what\rquote s your name?\rdblquote 
\par <#/>"Amina," I said. <#/>That was one of my many <-/pseudonames>. <#/>It was popularly believed among our clientele that coastal women were sexier than others and therefore we often adopted muslim <-/pseudonames>.
\par <#/>"Yes Amina, yo
u see our society is terrible. <#/>Some of our sisters have even to sell their bodies... <#/>" I felt like abusing and insulting him. <#/>Why was he talking to me like this? <#/>It was none of his business. <#/>But the man was so nice and talked with such
 seriousness that he completely disarmed me of all courage to answer him back. <#/>Moreover, the fact that I was being talked to seriously and as an equal flattered my ego and I wanted to hear more.
\par <#/>"Sister, it is not your fault. <#/>It is the fault of 
our society. <#/>It is only because our society is full of inequalities and injustices. <#/>It is because some have a lot and others have nothing that even sisters are reduced to earn a living by converting their bodies into commodities.\rdblquote 
\par <#/>I was now har
dly following what my <-/youngman> was saying. <#/>I liked his sweet voice. <#/>I liked the way he talked, as if talking to a student or his younger sister. <#/>But I did not understand a single word of his, yet I felt he was telling me truth.
\par <#/>"Do you teach <-/philosopy>?" I couldn\rquote t resist asking him.
\par <#/>He turned round, smiled and continued.
\par <#/>"Love and sex should be mutual; should give pleasure and satisfaction to both partners \endash  not a commodity on the market to be sold to the highest bidder....\rdblquote 
\par <#/>His voice tapered off and appeared to be coming from far away as sleep overpowered me and I dozed off.
\par <#/>Next when I opened my eyes it was already daylight. <#/>I was lying in my host\rquote s only bed covered by a bedsheet. <#/>My host was lying on th
e <-/coach>. <#/>He had not cared even to undress himself. <#/>An open book was resting across his face gently pressing against his childish nose.
\par <#/>"He must have put me to bed," I reckoned, feeling partly embarrassed and partly pleased.
\par <#/>My host prepared some tea and we had breakfast together.
\par <#/>"I\rquote m sorry I bothered you with my lectures last night," he said.
\par <#/>"Oh! <#/>Forget it. <#/>You are such a good teacher," I said with utmost politeness.
\par <#/>"Could you please drive me to Kinondoni? <#/>" I asked.
\par <#/>My young philosopher was quiet and thoughtful throughout the drive. <#/>I wanted to make conversation but didn\rquote t dare disturb him.
\par <#/>As I began to get off the car }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24 , something kept telling me that I shouldn\rquote t lose him even if it meant I wouldn\rquote t earn a penny from him. <#/>He had flattered my ego by talking to me seriously and my ego wouldn
\rquote t let me lose him.
\par <#/>I liked the way he talked. <#/>Although I did not understand him I wanted to hear what he said again and again.
\par <#/>"When shall I see you again?" I asked him softly.
\par <#/>"I\rquote ll be at Bilicanas this evening...", he replied as a matter of course.
\par <#/>"Good-day and take care..." I said and walked off to my single room apartment in the building across the road.
\par <#/>Bob was sitting in my room. <#/>He had been let in by Elsie, my room-mate.
\par <#/>"I am sorry for what happened yesterday. <#/>Now there\rquote s a sailor I have already arranged with. <#/>Shall I bring him around this evening or would you prefer to see him at the Highways?\rdblquote 
\par <#/>"I am damn tired. <#/>I want to snatch a few hours of sleep. <#/>Bring him here after mid-night. <#/>This room will be free. <#/>Elsie is sleeping out tonight. <#/>And please do not disturb me until then.\rdblquote 
\par <#/>The truth was that I wanted to spend the early hours of the evening with my philosopher friend and hear his sweet voice.</I>

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>IT was during my secondary school days that I came across many students from various <-_area><+_areas>. <#/>Before admission to that school I was a herdboy in my grandfather's compound while my parents were living in Dar es Salaam.

\par <#/>I encountered a girl I came to love. <#/>Love was not taught in the classrooms, but the society around forced me to be aware of that game. <#/>LOVE. <#/>Let it not be the society, the age I was in contributed to my love and to be loved }{

\par <#/>It is not easy to let you know how we became friends or lovers. <#/>It was inexplicable, she adored me and I admired her. <#/>Between adoring and admiring we suddenly become lovers! <#/>At that time she was in Form One while I was in Form Two.
\par <#/>The <-/inagural> years of our bilateral relations were really sweet. <#/>We shared views and deeds. <#/>Very friendly though as a rule requires we didn't <-_indulged><+_indulge> ourselves }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\b\fs24\lang2057 /}{

 in and outside our hearts. <#/>Some people started to feel jealous about it but the love we had, }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct}{\fs24\lang2057  proved too strong for anybody else to break our relations.
\par <#/>It was at that time I believed the heart of a person in love is full of imagination, passion, desire, spirit of worship and respect. <#/>Asha to me was something valuable, she filled a <-/vaccum> I had before.
\par <#/>When I was in Form Four, we got into a riddle. <#/>The reason behind }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar/object}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 was that, }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>punct}{\fs24\lang2057 
 we knew exactly that <-_on><+_in> October of that year we had to part. <#/>I had to leave her behind because it was my fourth year while for her it was the third. <#/>I completed
 four years of secondary education. <#/>My friend Khalid urged me to repeat but the rules spurned his idea. <#/>After all Khalid was merely joking me }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar/intrans}{\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>It was really bitter for me. <#/>How come for poor me to part ways }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  wi
th a girl I loved with all my heart? On her side she kept on promising me not to worry since she was mine. <#/>"I am yours, if you like it, I will be yours in whatever way it pleases you, take charge of me Silva". <#/>Furthermore she argued that since I w
as leaving her behind, communication would be a vital }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar/adj}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 to facilitate and enhance our love. <#/>Although I joined her to think that way }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{
\fs24\lang2057 , still I needed her closest presence.
\par <#/>It was like a dream, the fourth and the final year of
 my secondary education reached its climax. <#/>I tried to persuade Asha for our friendship to be more than mere words. <#/>"<-_No><+_Not> until we get married, why hurry dear Silva?" She lamented. <#/>I accepted it without much obstinacy, we remained fai
thful to each other.
\par <#/>After completion of that "bad" fourth year, I left the school to join my family in Dar es Salaam. <#/>At the railway station, Asha showed up just to bid me farewell. <#/>She kissed me and patted me on my back saying "have courage, Silva." }{
\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Then we parted!
\par <#/>In Dar es Salaam life to me was a little bit meaningless.
\par <#/>I kept on thinking day and night about Asha. <#/>I was longing for her heavily }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>To me she was the sense that could provide the efficient force whic
h might change dilemmas of life into happiness. <#/>The very first love was consuming my conscience }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>Anyway, let it be, whatever the cost, I believed Asha was born for me and me for her. <#/>This was our motto.
\par <#/>Time flows, it moves towards a certain goal. <#/>Some believe time to be a <-/never ending> circle, repeating itself season after season and year after year.
\par <#/>Time always tells or reveals good and bad things. <#/>So time was there to tell about our affair.
\par <#/>The first year of our isolation was really tough to me. <#/>I used to visit }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  post office frequently just to check for letters coming from Asha! <#/>}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>orth}{\fs24\lang2057 
 several times in her letters she repeated that she was born for my sake so I should not worry. <#/>She urged me to work hard to mould our future and that of our generation to come, the duty I took efficiently }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{
\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>The <-/correspondece> was based on achievements.
\par <#/>Since I had a godfather in the system, employment came to me easily. <#/>I was emplo
yed by a <-/goverment> firm in Dar es Salaam as a clerk grade one. <#/>The probation which is one year proved difficult to me. <#/>The reason was very clear, thinking about Asha while I encountered new understanding about life at the same time. <#/>Job an
d love. <#/>It's tiresome.
\par <#/>She completed four years of secondary education as well.
\par <#/>As I did, }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>orth}{\fs24\lang2057  She went to Gonja to join her family. <#/>She used to tell me that she was the favourite of her mother among the family of six. <#/>That "mother-i
n-law" was a nurse. <#/>She wanted her daughter to be a nurse! <#/>Immediately after completing her secondary education her mother found a nurse school for Asha at Kiomboi.
\par <#/>When she was in Kiomboi our ties with Asha prevailed. <#/>I received colourful letters and post cards from my "darling". <#/>But time is always there to tell.
\par <#/>Later I received a colourful letter from my Asha. <#/>Among other things she begged me a pardon in advance that, she would not write frequently to me as she used earlier be
cause her tests were tough so she had to study hard. <#/><-/Understoond>?" she stressed. <#/>I agreed but reminded her to write even twice a month. <#/>Seven years went by.
\par <#/>Four months passed without a letter from her.
\par <#/>I got furious to }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  the postal system due to its nature of delaying letters to customers. <#/>I believed Asha had posted a letter but it has stuck somewhere within the postal system}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 
<&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24\lang2057 !
\par <#/><-_On><+_In> the six month of that year I <-/recived> a <-/much-waited> letter from Kiomboi, colourful too. <#/>The central message was "be patient, one day yes. <#/>" But seven years of patience!
\par <#/>That message to some extent started to tear asunder my hope }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_of>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 marrying Asha every time "be patient," every time "wait" Why so? I kept on asking myself.
\par <#/>It was really agonising. <#/>I've never heard about that girl anymore. <#/>The news about her completion at Kiomboi reached me by coincidence but it was true that she completed <-/succesfully>. <#/>I <-_though><+_thought> she
 was dead but dismissed the idea.
\par <#/>Then I was <-/twenty nine>. <#/>My parents especially, mother, were pestering me with <-_an><+_the> idea of marriage. <#/>My father was the power behind my mother's demands, though he never told me directly. <#/>The on

\par <#/>Who will take over Asha? Who in this planet may challenge Asha and pull her out of my heart? I found it difficult but I prayed so that the <-/aAmighty> may provide me with a good beautiful wife.
\par <#/>Although Asha had to go, I wanted her to remain my greatest friend. <#/>Rather than thinking aloud about becoming my wife, I placed her among the group of my best friends I had encountered }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 .
\par <#/>There was a banker who was working with the mighty National Bank of commerce branch in the  city. <#/>She was my second choice after Asha. <#/>Our parents were friends for a long time till then }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>These two families were close }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057  for me to marry Furaha. <#/>In the <-/begining> I was reluctant for I had Asha in my minds }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>idiom}{\fs24\lang2057 . <#/>Now that Ash

\par <#/>The day came a very big wedding took place }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
. <#/>Furaha and Silva became one flesh. <#/>I didn't expect it to happen that way but time came to set the course. <#/>Now Furaha is my wife. <#/>We married two months ago at Saint Alban's Anglican Church, in the City. <#/>I hope to get a child!
\par <#/>Last 
Saturday when I was turning at the corner of Zanaki and Kaluta Street my eyes met that of Asha. <#/>Still elegant and pretty. <#/>She was attractive as ever! <#/>Curled her hair romantically! <#/>We joyously remembered the old good days and embraced. <#/>
She showed a desirable gesture to me but }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  ring around my finger a betrayal!
\par <#/>Finally after }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  long time of blaming each other, I told her that I was married. <#/>"We are just friends" now.</I>
