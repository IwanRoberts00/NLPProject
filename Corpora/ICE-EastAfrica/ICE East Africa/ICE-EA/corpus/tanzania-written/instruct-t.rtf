\par <I> <h> <#/>V REPORT OF UDASA'S AD HOC COMMITTEE APPOINTED TO STUDY AND ADVISE ON THE "INSTITUTIONAL TRANSFORMATION PROGRAMME: UDSM 2000" </h>
\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>At its special meeting on 17th September, 1993 UDASA appointed an }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_ad>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 hoc committee of five members (with powers of co-option) to serve under the following }{
\fs24\ul\lang2057 terms of reference}{\fs24\lang2057 : -
\par <#/>1. To review the set of documents, collectively entitled: "Institutional Transformation Programme: UDSM 2000," which constitute an expression of the University administration's quest for instituting major
 changes in the structure, functions and size of the University of Dar es Salaam.
\par <#/>2. To review any other related material, especially the administration's proposals concerning the amendments to the University of Dar es Salaam Act, 1970.
\par <#/>3. To submit, within one month, a report which, if adopted by UDASA, would constitute the latter's contribution to the debate on the proposed reforms embodied in the "UDSM 2000" document.
\par <#/>The ad hoc committee consisted of the following members: 
\par 1. Prof. <name/> Convener
\par 2. Prof. <name/> Member
\par 3. Dr <name/> Member
\par 4. Prof. <name/> Member
\par 5. Dr <name/> Member
\par 6. Prof. <name/> Coopted Member
\par <h> <#/>THE COMMITTEE'S REVIEW PROCESS </h>
\par <#/>After scrutinising the four documents on the "Institutional Transfor
mation Programme" (Facts and Figures; Analyses, Studies, Reports, Reference Documentation; Corporate Strategic Plan; and Programme Outline, Report and Plan of Action), the committee took the view that, of the 4 documents, document C on the "Corporate Stra
tegic Plan," constitutes the kernel of the whole initiative. <#/>The rest constitute either a background to or an elaboration of this key document. <#/>The committee therefore decided to base the thrust of its review on the Corporate Strategic Plan.

\par <#/>UDA
SA's committee also looked at the proposed amendments to the University Act based on the recommendations of the Masuha committee. <#/>Although UDSM 2000 is listed by the Masuha committee as one of the documents that they consulted, we were convinced that 
t
he proposed amendments to the Act bear no relation whatsoever to the radical initiatives embodied in the UDSM 2000 documents. <#/>The committee therefore found it unnecessary to make any comment of substance on the proposed amendments to the Act in relati
on to UDSM 2000.
\par <h> <#/>THE COMMITTEE'S REPORT </h>
\par <#/>The committee wishes to recommend to UDASA the following Report for adoption as the organisation's contribution to the University community's deliberations on the "Institutional Transformation Programme: UDSM 2000.\rdblquote 
\par <h> <#/>0. 0 INTRODUCTION: </h>
\par 0. 1<#/>As a preface to our comments on the
 document entitled: "Institutional Transformation Programme, UDSM 2000," we would like to make a few general remarks. <#/>We commend the immense effort which has gone into producing the document and agree with a lot of the points made. <#/>It is also laud
a
ble that the administration, rather than elect to go it alone, has sought to involve the University community in a dialogue about the reform plans. <#/>However, we have a number of critical observations which we hope will constitute UDASA's contribution t
oward an improved version of the document. <#/>Our report concentrates more on those areas on which we disagree with the architects of UDSM 2000 than on issues to which we have no objection.
\par <#/>0.2 We share the concern that, as the University of Dar es Sal
aam moves towards the 21st century, it will be expected to plan and control its use of resources more vigorously than has hitherto been the case. <#/>The University will also be required over time to measure its performance against its stated objectives a
nd/or expected outputs. <#/>Indeed, strategic planning is just a process of specifying or reaffirming corporate objectives and the means of accomplishing them.
\par <#/>0.3 Few would therefore deny that the University may need to undergo a process of reform, if 
not restructuring. <#/>Therefore the initiative to make changes with a view to improving the position of the UDSM, basing, among other things, on previous studies, is commendable. <#/>It is through such an exercise in self-examination that the University 
c
an be made more efficient, effective and responsive to the needs of society. <#/>Given the fact that more than twenty years have elapsed since the University has been in existence as an independent academic institution, the present initiative is probably 
timely.
\par <#/>0. 4 We would like to caution, however, that the restructuring of the UDSM must take into consideration its history and established traditions, as well as the country's conditions and the hopes and aspirations of the Tanzanian people regarding t
he role of their national University. <#/>It is true that the country is undergoing changes but one has to distinguish between the changes initiated by the Tanzanians themselves, and which accord with their aspirations, from those changes currently being 
pursued under external pressure. <#/>The former would be rooted in the society and the latter might change with the change of circumstances or at the whims of the political regime or even at the withdrawal of external support.
\par <#/>0.5 Before addressing the 
substance of the proposed programme, we would like to stress one important point. <#/>Although certain benefits accrue to individuals who graduate from institutions of higher learning, university education and scientific knowledge creation should not, str
i
ctly speaking, be treated as private goods to be sold in the market place. <#/>Like roads, sanitation or, indeed, national security, they are public goods requiring public funding. <#/>Universities, therefore, as instruments for education and scientific k
nowledge creation, serve not so much the individual citizens as the community as a whole. <#/>As instruments for the people, Universities ought to be accountable to them.
\par <#/>0.6 The document is presented in six parts (chapters) and we would like to comment
 on it along the same organisational lines, viz.: Institutional Process of Change; Mission into the 21st Century; Ownership, Authority and Governance; Administrative Structures; Inputs; and Outputs.
\par <h> <#/>1.0 THE INSTITUTIONAL PROCESS OF CHANGE: TRANSFORMATION AND STRATEGIC PLAN </h>
\par <#/>1.1 The context of the review on the institutional process of change is based on the following assumptions (a) diminution or even withdrawal of state provision and financing of higher education (b) expansion of one Unive
rsity, i.e. UDSM, and (c) economic liberalisation and market driven provision of university education. <#/>The first assumption discounts an important historical fact that, whether one is looking at the modern capitalist states or, indeed, the countries o
f
 late capitalism, (the so-called Asian Tigers), state intervention, not only in economic management but also in education and research, largely accounts for their success. <#/>The second assumption rules out possibilities of competition with other univers
i
ties, for example SUA, for the same services, clients, resources, markets and shareholders. <#/>We submit that the recommendations of the task force on "The Tanzanian Education System for the 21st Century" regarding increase in enrolment of university stu
dents did not envisage expansion only at the University of Dar es Salaam. <#/>The third assumption is premised on the wrong argument that, if a product cannot compete in the market place, it has no utility value to society.
\par <#/>1.2 The corporate University 
for profit concept replacing a free, democratically controlled University, open to all the citizens, will result into a University system of education that caters for an elite who can afford to pay at the expenses of a socially provided University educati
o
n accessible for all. <#/>On the other hand, preoccupation with market driven services will result in the growth of differentiated demand which would favour high status and high private returns fields of study like law, engineering, medicine and commerce.

\par <#/>1.3 The major vision and purpose of the document should be to define movement towards an entrepreneurial and intrapreneurial university, rather than a corporate university, and then proceed to describe the new profile of the UDSM, bearing in mind the 
questions: What is our }{\fs24\ul\lang2057 mission}{\fs24\lang2057 , and what }{\fs24\ul\lang2057 strategy}{\fs24\lang2057  will be adopted in order to meet the intended goals?
\par <#/>1.4 The three immediate objectives given at page 5 are not quite followed through in the document. <#/>Indeed, the pressing issues which need to be ad
dressed by a sensible micro-strategic plan are: governance, quality, relevance, equity, sources of financing, and efficient use of resources. <#/>Yet these issues are given scanty treatment without a clear articulation of their operationalisation. <#/>Onc
e
 again what is missing is the clarity in the direction to which all corporate mobility should cumulate. <#/>Of course, we are not given an overview of the plans of the six faculties and the way the latter intend to integrate the institutional profile into
 their faculty development plans.
\par <#/>1.5 In a corporate strategic plan one would have liked to see a mention of the strategic instruments to be adopted, i.e. Organisation, Budget, Entrepreneurial dimension, Intrapreneurial dimension, Performance standards,
 Performance measurement. <#/>These are neither defined nor developed. <#/>Thus it is very difficult to judge how efficiency and effectiveness will be attained. <#/>For example, by implication of a corporate setting, the document wants, apart form practic
a
lly oriented education and highly qualified research and consultancy, to develop activities which, unfortunately, do not fit in the traditional setting of a university, being corporately organized according to public law, but which can be realised in a st
r
ucture according to civic law. <#/>A certain measure of independence is implied: but does this mean abandoning university tasks towards a private company or a private enterprise closely related the University in order to be able to fulfil new tasks as spi
n-offs of the regular university tasks?
\par <#/>1.6 Some specific comments on the institutional process of change:-
\par (a) <#/>The grounds for disputing the staff-student ratios quoted at p.4 are legitimate. <#/>The figures misrepresent the work-load of the academ
ic staff. <#/>Apart from the fact that the ratios include those on training and on leave of absence, they ignore a number of important variables, for example, unfilled posts, number of courses taught, backwardness of the teaching technology, and non-use o
f
 graduate teaching assistants as is the case, for example, the North American universities. <#/>From a technical point of view it is inappropriate to base the ratios on head counts, as the document does. <#/>We propose that, in future strategic planning e
x
ercises, efforts should be made to compute the Full Time Equivalents (FTEs) ratios. <#/>Indeed the facts and figures as given in Issue No.2 cannot serve a meaningful planning exercise as several indicators of efficiency and effectiveness are not given. <#
/>These should include: unit costs per faculty/field of study; shares of budget for research/teaching/administration/support services; research output per staff member; retention rates, dropout rates; and duration of study in student years
\par (b) <#/>The Corpo
rate Strategic Plan's target scenario for a final overall student <-/enrollment> of some 8,000-12,000, to be reached by the year 2,000 is unrealistic unless there are drastic changes in the internal efficiency of the institution. <#/>Under the present and
 
foreseeable circumstances, such changes cannot be envisaged. <#/>We doubt if enough resources could be garnered to expand the University's physical plant and other facilities to a level that would support the planned increase in enrolment. <#/>Given the c
u
rrent classroom utilisation frequency and pressure on such resources as the library, the laboratories and other teaching facilities, one cannot but express a sense of pessimism concerning the prospects of substantially increased enrolment. <#/>Anxiety is 
a
lready being expressed, for example, regarding the effects of the recent increased intake in the Faculty of Engineering. <#/>Also, the backwardness of the teaching technology employed may necessitate recruitment of additional academic staff beyond what is
 attainable during the period in question.
\par <h> <#/>2.0 MISSION INTO THE 21ST CENTURY </h>
\par <#/>2.1 Without wishing to underplay the significance of the other sections of the document, section two is probably the most critical component of what is envisaged 
in the Plan. <#/>This is the part which ought to define the direction of the reform programme in its general and specific outlines. <#/>It is from that defined direction that all the administrative setups or the academic objectives will have to converge. 
<#/>Failing to do this, the exercise will be without purpose and is likely to produce unintended results.
\par <#/>2.2 The section attempts to present the direction in terms of what is called: "Mission into the 21st Century. <#/>" In its broad sense therefore, t
he direction is defined in terms of a Calendar , the 21st century. <#/>It is not unusual for society to see its progress in terms of annual or epochal accomplishments. <#/>In fact, a plan should define a time perspective. <#/>What is lacking in this gener
a
l definition of the mission, however, is a characterization of the constituents of the 21st century of the University of Dar es Salaam. <#/>What kind of cosmos, for example, is envisaged during the 21st century, and what place does the University of Dar e
s Salaam have in realising that vision? <#/>What are these images, aspirations and ideals that can be realised as at 2,000 or beyond?</I}{\b\fs24\lang2057 >}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\v\fs24\lang2057

\par <I> An "In-County Training Scheme" and a "Local Expertise Support Scheme" have been successfully deployed for the past 4 years at the Faculty of Engineering in an "institutional tran

\par <#/>The University management is currently negotiating with various parties on support and cooperation in the recently launched Institutional Transformation Program "UDSM

tructuring etc.. <#/>We have found a positive response as the schemes allow for performance based remuneration for special assignments and programs but do not establish some kind of regular topping-up payments.
\par <#/>The Program Management Unit (PMU) has thus been requested to review the scheme with a view to adapt them to the special conditions of the program activities ahead under the "UDSM 2000" approach.
\par <#/>You are herewith requested to

\par <#/>(d) All FoE staff is eligible to local expertise support scheme.
\par <#/>(e) In principle the scheme should only be used on the basis of on the job commitment and performance ensuring that both the candidates and the faculty's needs and interests are reasonably considered.
\par <#/>(f) Where expertise is sought from outside the faculty due to lack of similar expertise in house, these will be remunerated at negotiated rates but not above market rates.
\par <#/>(g) The scheme shall apply on in-house and external contracts to undertake activity within the scope of this scheme.

\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<#/>
(i) (a) Heads of mission arriving to take position in Tanzania, for the first time are met at the airport by a representative of the Chief of Protocol of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. <#/>Missions should therefore give adequate no
tice of the arrival of a new head of mission to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to enable the Protocol Division facilitate immigration formalities.
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang1031 {\fs24\lang2057 <#/>(b) Non-resident Ambassadors accredited to the United Republic of Tanzania, arriving to present credent
ials, are <-/similary> met at the airport by a representative of the Chief of Protocol of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. <#/>In addition, the Protocol Division provides transport and can, upon request, assist in making hotel reservations for such envoys
. <#/>On all other visits non-resident Ambassadors are expected to make their own transport and <-/accomodation> arrangements. <#/>The Ministry's role is limited to facilitating the appointments of the envoys with senior government leaders only .
\par <#/>(c) Missions are expected to make arrangements for the reception of other members of staff arriving in Tanzania.
\par <#/>(ii) Members of staff of missions together with their families and households are exempted from registering as aliens and from applying for resid
ence permits before arriving in Tanzania. <#/>Missions are nonetheless reminded that this exemption does not extend to visa requirements. <#/>Missions should as far as is practicable, advise incoming staff to get entry visas, before departure. <#/>Residen
c
e permits are issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs after arrival. <#/>Missions should route applications for residence permits through the Protocol Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. <#/>Once issued, residence permits are valid for a period of
 two years, and have to be renewed thereafter.
\par <#/>(iii) State guests, including Heads of State and Government together with their delegations, special envoys, representatives of donor nations arriving for negotiations, experts and consultants invited by th
e government as well as staff of missions and their families are exempted from changing USD 50 or the equivalent, in convertible currency at the point of entry. <#/>Nonetheless this exemption does not extend to cover members of families accompanying repre
s
entatives of donor nations coming to negotiate agreements or those who accompany experts and consultants invited into the country for specific negotiations. <#/>Missions should note however that the amount of money to be changed at the point of entry is s
ubject to change from time to time.
\par <#/>(iv) Missions, are required to communicate to the Protocol Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the arrival of any new member of staff, together with his/her name, and rank, and where app
licable, the name of the spouse and dependants accompanying him/her.
\par <#/>(v) The Protocol Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs arranges for the issuance of identity cards for members of mission after arrival. <#/>There are three types of identity ca
rds issued, namely the blue card for diplomatic staff and certain categories of officials of international organisations, the red card issued to consular officers and the green card issued to non-diplomatic personnel. <#/>In case of replacement of personn
e
l, no identity card will be issued to the incoming staff, before the surrender of the identity card of the departing staff. <#/>The Ministry also arranges to have the names of new members of missions published in the Official Gazette as well as in the lis
t
 of Diplomatic and Consular missions, Trade and International Organisations, which is published twice a year. <#/>Alterations in the rank of mission personnel as well as any other changes should be notified to the Chief of Protocol for effecting amendment
s to the diplomatic list.
\par <h> <#/>2. AIRPORT PASSES </h>
\par <#/>Apart from the identity card, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also arranges for two airport passes to be issued for the use of the head of mission and his or her spouse. <#/>An additional floatin
g pass is issued for general use by missions for official purposes. <#/>This pass is intended to be used in conjunction with the pass holders' own identity card. <#/>Airport passes give the holder access to the VIP lounge as well as to the transit, arriva
l
 and departure lounges. <#/>Airport passes must be produced whenever requested by airport authorities, whilst in the premises of the airport. <#/>On no account should airport passes be used by mission personnel for purchases from airport duty-free shops i
f not travelling. <#/>Applications for these passes should be addressed to the Chief of Protocol of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
\par <h><#/>3. USE OF THE VIP LOUNGE </h>
\par <#/>(i) Missions are reminded that the use of the VIP lounge is strictly restricted t
o personal use by heads of mission and members of their families. <#/>With the exception of first arrival and final departure at the end of a tour of duty, when a head of mission is expected to be welcomed and seen-off by the staff of his mission and coll
e
agues in the diplomatic corps, at all other times, heads of mission are expected to be escorted by not more than one person when travelling. <#/>In cases of first arrival and final departure, missions are required to give reasonable notice of their intent
ion to use the VIP lounge to the Protocol Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
\par <#/>(ii) Heads of mission are expected to seek prior authorisation of the Protocol Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whenever they require to use the VIP loung
e to receive any visitors or guests who are not members of their families including official delegations. <#/>Heads of mission are requested to ensure scrupulous compliance with this requirement.
\par <h> <#/>4. DIPLOMATIC BAGS </h>
\par <#/>Diplomatic bags should 
be sealed and clearly marked for ease of identification. <#/>Unaccompanied bags should be collected by a duly authorised representative of the mission at the cargo section of the airport, while couriers should be met at the arrival lounge. <#/>In no circu
mstance should couriers be met in the VIP lounge. <#/>Missions are advised to get in touch directly with the airport authorities in advance of the arrival of couriers in order to facilitate their reception and to avoid inconveniences.
\par <h> <#/>5. LOCALLY ENGAGED STAFF </h>
\par <#/>The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania respects the right of missions to freely appoint members of staff of their missions. <#/>However, in those cases where a mission wishes to employ a non-Tanzanian national as a local sta
ff, the mission, has to comply with Tanzanian Law regulating the employment of foreigners. <#/>Local staff personnel are governed by Tanzanian Law, and regardless of nationality, are not entitled to duty free purchases, privileges and immunities. <#/>Furt
hermore missions or mission personnel who bring in local staff personnel from outside Tanzania, must ensure that such personnel leave Tanzania at the end of their contracts of service.
\par <#/>(ii) Missions may wish to consider utilising the services of the Tan
zanian Police Force to check on the past records of any prospective employee whom a mission is contemplating to recruit. <#/>Missions desiring such services, should channel their requests through the Chief of Protocol of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

\par <#/>(iii) Missions are expected to notify the Protocol Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the engagement and discharge of local staff.
\par <h> <#/>6. DEPENDANTS NOT TO UNDERTAKE REMUNERATIVE WORK </h>
\par <#/>As a general rule, dependants of members of 
diplomatic missions are not allowed to undertake remunerative work in Tanzania. <#/>In exceptional cases, the Ministry might consider allowing a dependant of a diplomatic agent or consular officer to undertake remunerative work. <#/>In such a case, the pe
rson concerned shall cease to be considered as a dependant for the duration of his/her employment. <#/>Applications for such permits should be made to the Chief of Protocol of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
\par <h> <#/>7. EXEMPTIONS FROM TAXATION </h>
\par <#/>Th
e exemptions from taxation to which missions and their personnel are entitled to are set out in parts I, II, III and IV of the Fourth Schedule to the Diplomatic and Consular Immunities and Privileges Act (No. 5 of 1986). <#/>Additional exemptions are gran
ted under the Immunities and Privileges (Taxes and Duties) Order, GN 120 of 1975 issued on the 12 June, 1975. <#/>The following exemptions are granted under these two pieces of legislation, as well as in other legislation.
\par <#/>(i) Missions are exempt from all direct taxes in respect of their premises. <#/>This includes exemption from:
\par (a) Capital gains tax
\par (b) Stamp duty and registration fees under the Land Ordinance of 1923, for registration of leases

\par <#/>(b) Members of missions having valid international 
driving licences as well as licences issued by Commonwealth countries are exempt from the requirement of having to do and pass a driving test. <#/>However members of missions who do not hold a recognised licence must do and pass a driving test. <#/>Exempt
ion is similarly granted on application through the Chief of Protocol of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
\par <#/>(iv) Missions and their privileged staff are exempted from <AmE/>licencing their television sets and video cassette recorders. <#/>Nonetheless miss
ions and their personnel are required to register these items with the Commissioner for Customs and Sales Tax. <#/>Registration is effected upon payment of a nominal fee on importation.
\par <#/>v) Members of missions are exempted under the Income Tax Act of 19
73 from paying income tax in respect of their emoluments. <#/>This exemption also extends to members of the service staff and domestic servants of heads of mission provided they are not Tanzanians nor permanent residents of Tanzania.
\par <#/>(vi) Members of mission are also exempt from the payment of all Arms licence fees under the Arms and Ammunition Ordinance, Cap 223 of the Law of Tanzania.

ations and their Deputies in Tanzania are entitled to immunity from customs duties, sales tax and excise duty on goods of foreign origin imported into the country for the personal use of such officer and his/her family. <#/>However other officials of Inte

\par <#/>(ix) Tanzanian citizens working in International Organizations as Directors or Deputy Directors are exempt, under Section 15 of Act No. 5 of 1986, from personal tax and income tax in respect of emoluments received as officials of such Organisations .

\par <#/>(x) Tanzanian citizens employed in International Organisations in the professional category as officers or advisers are exempted under Section 15 (b) of Act No. 5 of 1986 from payment of customs duty.
\par <#/>(xi) The rest of Tanzanian citizens working in I
nternational Organisations are supposed to pay income tax only in respect of a part of the salary, equivalent to the salary earned by the employee before being employed by the International Organisation, under Section 16(b) of Act No. 5 of 1986.
\par <h> <#/>8. FINANCIAL MATTERS AND REGULATIONS </h>
\par <#/>The Ministry wishes to draw the attention of missions to the existence of the Exchange Control Regulations issued by the Bank of Tanzania, applicable to diplomatic missions, and their officials, residing in Tanz
ania. <#/>Missions are requested to encourage their officials to acquaint themselves with these regulations. <#/>The following provisions apply:
\par (i) Travel Outside Tanzania
\par <#/>Non-Tanzanian personnel of diplomatic missions and the members of their familie
s can undertake travel to and from Tanzania by any airline or shipping line freely against payment of foreign convertible currency out of their external accounts maintained with an authorised dealer. <#/>Missions should note that their staff are not exemp
ted from payment of airport service charges when travelling.
\par <#/>(ii) Imports
\par <#/>Within the limits set out hereunder, diplomatic missions and their non-Tanzanian personnel are required to fill in PRO 6 forms available from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs a
nd to obtain import licences from the Import <AmE/>Licencing Directorate of the Bank of Tanzania for all imports from abroad for their bona fide use. <#/>Licences are issued liberally and expeditiously on receipt of applications on the prescribed form aga
inst payment of a fee.
\par <#/>Payments for these imports, including freight charges and insurance premium should be made out of external accounts in foreign currency. <#/>Such imports are free of customs duty, sales tax and excise duty. <#/>However, the exempt
ion of consular posts headed by Honorary Consuls undertaking gainful private occupation from duty, is limited to office stationery, furniture and equipment, imported at the instance of the sending state.
\par <#/>(a) In effecting duty free purchases, entitled n
on-Tanzanian personnel are required to fill in the PRO 6 form for approval by the Chief of Protocol of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. <#/>Tanzanian citizens employed in a professional category as advisers or officials in International Organisations are 
exempt from paying customs duties under section 15 (b) of the Diplomatic and Consular Immunities and Privileges Act. <#/>Such personnel should also use the PRO 6 form for clearance of articles they import.
\par <#/>(b) Missions should send the specimen signature
s of the Head of Mission and two other senior staff authorised to sign PRO 6 and CD 3 forms on behalf of the mission, together with the mission's seal, to the Protocol Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</I>

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 1.1. The Second Annual Consultative meeting on the Institutional Transformation Programme "UDSM-2000", organised by the PMU and chaired by the Vice Chancellor, Prof. M. L. Luhanga, was held on 21st-22nd September, 1995 in
 the University Council Chamber.
\par <#/>The meeting was attended by the University members of staff, Government officials, and members of the donor community. <#/>(The list of participants is attached as Annex. 1). <#/>In addition to the opening speech, deliv
ered by the Chairman of the University Council, Ambassador F.M. Kazaura, a total of 10 papers were presented and discussed. <#/>These form the core of the proceedings as presented under the headings which follow. <#/>Mr. J.V. Mwapachu, Vice Chairman of th
e University Council delivered the closing speech.
\par <h> }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 2. OPENING  </h>
\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 2.1. We
lcoming the participants to the Second Annual Consultative meeting on the Institutional Transformation Programme, "UDSM-2000", the Chairman pointed out that the meeting was intended to bring together all the stakeholders, i.e. the University, Government a
n
d the donor community, to deliberate on the progress of the transformation process in order to assess whether or not the University was on the right track; to receive and discuss a report on the activities of the PMU and contribute ideas which would enabl
e
 the University to refine or fine-tune its original concepts contained in the Strategic Corporate Plan which was adopted in August, 1994. <#/>He pointed out that the meeting, planned to be held annually, was a follow up on the first consultative meeting h
eld in 1993.
\par <h> }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 2.2. OPENING ADDRESS BY THE GUEST OF HONOUR AMBASSADOR F. M. KAZAURA, CHAIRMAN OF THE UNIVERSITY COUNCIL </h>
\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 2.2.1. In his opening address the Chairman of the University Council observed that fast moving changes in the global econ
omy, political scene and developments in Science and Technology had compelled all institutions, including Universities, to adjust themselves to the new environment by adopting planning strategies that can quickly take care of the changed environment and r
easonably forecast what should be expected of them in the years ahead. <#/>He noted that for that reason, most Universities in the world had adopted the well proven technique of strategic planning which the University of Dar es Salaam too adopted in 1994.

\par <
#/>2.2.2. He observed that since institutions were dynamic, it was expected that the concept enunciated in UDSM Corporate Strategic Plan would be reviewed and refined periodically to suit the situation. <#/>He expressed hope that during the two days of th
e
 consultative meeting, deliberations would be directed towards revisiting the objectives and the main features of the UDSM transformation programme and the progress of implementing the Corporate Strategic Plan particularly the progress made since the last
 
consultative meeting held in September, 1993. <#/>It was hoped that during the two days meeting the strengths, weaknesses, threats and opportunities of the institution would be clearly assessed, especially in terms of outputs delivery which act as a gauge
 of a good University.
\par <#/>2.2.3 The Chairman of the University Council further called upon the participants to address the following issues:
\par (i) the transformation of the organisational culture since it was not only of relevance to the University but was also of national importance;
\par (ii) the UDSM legal status: whether it was flexible enough to accommodate the transformation process;
\par (iii) the role and place of the external donors in the transformation process in order to ensure that the transformation process could be sustained.
\par <h> }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 3. OBJECTIVES AND RELEVANCE OF THE INSTITUTIONAL TRANSFORMATION PROGRAMME: UNIVERSITY OF DAR ES SALAAM-2000 </h>
\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
3.1. OBSERVED that developments since the First Consultative Meeting on UDSM Transformation Programme held in 1993 had further confirmed the need for transformation if the University is to enter the 21st century in a manner that would guarantee ful
filment of its role.
\par <#/>3.2. IDENTIFIED some of these <-_development><+_developments> as comprising:
\par (i) the worsening University's financial situation due to decreasing Governmental budgetary allocation which had gone down to 28% of the total University's requirements;
\par (ii) <-/inspite> of the generous assistance from various donors, negotiations with them for additional support were increasingly getting difficult;
\par (iii) as earlier observed in 1993 the University student enrolment had stagnated and remained one of the lowest in the region. <#/>Only 30% of the qualifying candidates had for the past few years been admitted to the University of Dar es Salaam.
\par <#/>Particularly, admission of women students had declined over the years from 26% of the total enrolm
ent in 1979/80 to 17% in 1994/95 and despite the fact that Science and Technology were of paramount importance for the country to address itself for the 21st century, admissions into Science Faculty had also gone down from 37% in 1979/80 to 16% in 1995/96
;
\par (iv) employment opportunities for the University graduates were dwindling, which called for a review of curricula in a manner that would empower the graduates to go into entrepreneurship and private sector employment.
\par <#/>3.3. REITERATED that, as earlier 
informed at the First Consultative meeting in 1993, it was necessary for the University of Dar es Salaam to embark on the Institutional Transformation Programme - UDSM-2000" by addressing the forces that had historically reduced its operational capabiliti
es in order to renew itself through a process of a self-controlled organizational development geared towards empowering the University to effectively fulfil its mission.
\par <#/>3.4. NOTED that the UDSM Institutional transformation Programme aimed at giving the
 University internal autonomy to enable it operate efficiently and effectively; to advance relevance and quality of teaching, research and consulting while pursuing a systematic, rational quantitative expansion of student enrolment and overall capacity.

\par <#/>3.5. NOTED that the immediate objectives of the Institutional transformation Programme included:
\par (a) achieving a broad awareness of institutional facts and figures, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and risks through a dynamic stocktaking and adjustment process;
\par (b) achieving consensus on the corporate mission, objectives, policies, strategic plans and logistics to be deployed;
\par (c) pursuing organizational development process through mature and scientific dialogue between stakeholders, resulting in jointly formulated and implemented policies and strategies.
\par <#/>3.6. EXPRESSED satisfaction that the Institutional Transformation Programme "UDSM-2000" had taken off. <#/>However it was OBSERVED:
\par 1. that challenges of the Institutional Transformation were too big and complex which called for seriousness and commitment not only of the entire University community but also the Government and the Society as a whole;
\par 2. that it had stimulated a process of re-evalution, self-analysis, creativity and discovery thus injecting a new life into the University for dialogue and efforts towards improving University operations and search for excellence;
\par 3. that a number of individuals had dedicated their time and efforts in various specific tasks and activities geared towards 
implementing the Institutional Transformation, which showed that transformation could be achieved because the University staff had both the will and expertise;
\par 4. the programme had witnessed strong and generous support from the donor community, particularly from SIDA, EU, MHO, BMZ (GTZ) and NORAD, whose assistance had made it possible for the Institutional Transformation Programme to take off.
\par <#/>3.7. In view of the above observations, THANKED members of the University staff who in various capacities and t
hrough various activities had contributed their efforts and expertise towards implementing the Institutional Transformation. <#/>Particular thanks were made to the donor community for their moral and financial support.
\par <#/>3.8. EXPRESSED hope that given the above reasons the Institutional transformation programme would succeed.
\par <h> }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 4. THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE UDSM CORPORATE STRATEGIC PLAN </h>
\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 4.1. Rationale for the UDSM Corporate Strategic Plan 
\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 4.1.1. NOTED that the University of Dar es Salaa
m had during its 25 years of existence witnessed fundamental and dramatic changes taking place both locally and globally. <#/>These changes had called for a critical re-examination and re-definition of UDSM's role in order to evolve strategies for fulfill
ing its mission in the 21st century.
\par <#/>4.1.2. INFORMED that efforts to re-define the role of UDSM culminated in the formulation of the Institutional Transformation Programme "UDSM-2000" and crystallised in the document code-named the "UDSM Corporate Strat
egic Plan" which was approved by the University Council in August 1994.
\par <#/>4.1.3. NOTED that the strategic plan, broadly based on the National Higher Education Policy, defines the major policies and overall goals in addition to setting the broad objectives for UDSM.
\par <#/>4.2. Main Features of the Corporate Strategic Plan 
\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 4.2.1. NOTED that the Institutional Transformation Programme was designed to address both the management operations and outputs 
with regard to quality and relevance, quantity, equity, sources of financing, efficient use of resources and governance.
\par <#/>4.2.2. NOTED also that its immediate objectives include:
\par (i) achieving a broad awareness of the institutional facts and figures, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and risks;
\par (ii) achieving consensus on corporate mission, objectives, policies and the strategy to be adopted and
\par (iii) adopting development strategy which ensures a healthy climate and mature dialogue amongst all stakeholders.
\par <#/>4.2.3. NOTED that the Corporate Strategic Plan, enshrined in the Institutional Transformation Programme, focuses on:
\par (i) the University's internal deficits regarding policies and planning, efficiency and effectiveness of management, administrative, technical and academic back-up services; and
\par (ii) the national and societal deficits regarding professional human resource and capacity building related to higher education, research and development.
\par <#/>4.3.4. NOTED that for both scenarios the Corpora
te Strategic Plan defines the overall goals and set broad objectives for input divisions: Corporate management, policies and planning, finance, back-up services and administration; and for the output, divisions: Undergraduate studies, postgraduate studies
, research and publications, contracted research, consultancy and services.
\par <#/>4.3.5. NOTED that in addressing the internal deficits, the Corporate Strategic Plan re-defines the University mission, basic objectives, national role and functions, the outputs
 delivery functions, corporate set-up (ownership, autonomy and governance).
\par <#/>4.3.6. NOTED also that in addressing the internal deficits, the Corporate Strategic Plan proposes re-organization of the University administrative structure.
\par <#/>4.3.7. NOTED t
hat under the Corporate Strategic Plan, transformation of the UDSM administrative structure would be carried out by establishing four defined divisions of inputs and three defined divisions of outputs which attempt to introduce horizontal decentralization
.
\par <#/>These divisions were identified as:
\par Input divisions:
\par (i) Corporate Management
\par (ii) Policies and Planning
\par (iii) Finance
\par (iv) Back-up Services and Administration and
\par Outputs Divisions:
\par (i) <-_Undergraduates><+_Undergraduate> Studies,
\par (ii) Postgraduate Studies, Research and Publications,
\par (iii) Contracted Research, Consultancy and Services.
\par <#/>4.3.8. NOTED that in addition to the horizontal decentralization of the input and output divisions, the Corporate Strategic Plan envisaged that the University operations would be vertically structured into two operational and two coordinating levels.

\par <#/>4.3.9. NOTED that operationalization of activities involve formation of:
\par (a) "Schools" which would be largely autonomous but not independent entities, embracing a major sectoral field; and
\par (b) "Institutes" embracing a specialist subject area.
\par <#/>4.3.10. NOTED that the two coordinating levels would embrace the University as the overall entity responsible for all policy framework and Departments as academic units responsible for coordination of a major field of undergraduate study.
\par <#/>4.3.11. NOTED that the Corporate Strategic Plan envisaged dualization of the University management into represent
ative corporate management and operational line management. <#/>The former positions would be filled by democratically elected academic members of staff of the rank of professor
\par while the operational line management positions would be filled by responsible full professional qualified personnel.
\par <#/>4.3.12. NOTED that other areas envisaged to be reorganised under the input division include coordination of Policies and Planning, standardization of Operations and Procedures, having clear structured organizatio
nal charts, transformation of the organizational culture as well as laying donors strategies and formulating terms and conditions of service that would promote staff retention and effective human resource deployment.
\par <#/>4.3.13. OBSERVED that for the propo
sed Institutional Transformation Programme to be effectively carried out there was a need for the University to initiate dialogue with the Government regarding the most appropriate legal status with respect to ownership, autonomy and governance and which 
w
ould enable the University to pursue a strategy of "partnership in education" (share holder concept) thereby opening the University's doors for privately financed and third-party sponsored expansion of student enrolment expected to reach 8000 by the year 
2000.
\par <#/>4.3.14. NOTED the information that academic programmes would be reviewed with a view to producing job creators as opposed to job seekers. <#/>NOTED that it was envisaged that undergraduate enrolment would rise up to 8,000 by the year 2000 and to 1
3,000 by the year 2008. <#/>While postgraduate student figures would reach 1300 by the year 2000.
\par <#/>4.3.15. NOTED the information that emphasis on contracted research, consultancy and services would be placed on those projects that can generate income.
\par <#/>4.3.16. NOTED the five phases, as shown below, during which the Institutional Transformation Programme "UDSM-2000" would be implemented:
\par (a) 1991-1993: Take off phase - setting up the framework for the programme management and operations.
\par <#/>(b) 1992-1994: Development of policies and strategies.
\par <#/>(c) 1993-1995: Fine-tuning phase - drawing up detailed description of both the structure, organization and procedures.
\par <#/>(d) 1994-2002: Realization phase - independence, enhanced quality and relevance of programmes, quantitative expansion of output, finalised legal status and agreed operational mode.
\par <#/>(e) 1998-2006: Consolidation phase - improved quality and relevance, further increases in output, redressing of shortcomings, adjustment of programmes if need be.
\par <#/>5. DISCUSSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON CHAPTER 3 & 4 
\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 5.1. OBSERVED that implementation of the Institutional transformation Programme "UDSM-2000" had no time-frame but would be implemented in phases.
\par <#/>5.2. NOTED the information that implementation of the programme in overlapping phases was designed deliberately in order to allow for flexibility and adjustments.
\par <#/>5.3. WONDERED whether the University had apart from donors alternative sources of funding the Institutional Transformation Pro
gramme sought government support when it was well known that the Government had limited resources. <#/>RECEIVED information that the Government was sympathetic with the University's initiatives but it had not made a definite commitment in terms of funds.<

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <h> <#/>1.0 INTRODUCTION </h>
\par <#/>The University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM) has conceived and put into motion a process of institutional transformation programme ''UDSM-2000'' which has to lead the University to adequately fulfil its mission in the 21st century. <#/>To ensure that this p
rocess is on tract, a corporate strategic plan has been formulated to define overall goals and objectives on how these changes will be achieved.
\par <#/>Some of the key strategic objectives under the plan which are of relevance to land use and therefore crucial factors in determining future land use can be grouped as under:-
\par a) Mission objectives 
\par Expansion of student enrolment from the present number of about over 3,500 to over 10,000 students by the year 2000 and qualitative improvements thereof through provision of adequate physical facilities.
\par <#/>b)Economic imperatives 
\par i) Persistent under-funding of the University due to reduced Government capacity to adequately support it financially. <#/>The motive here is self-augmentation of University income as a means of ensuring sustainability.
\par <#/>ii) Changes in the socio-economic and political climate taking place in the country towards a more liberalized market oriented economy. <#/>The aim here is to attract investment capital which the University is unable to raise.
\par <#/>iii) Optimum and rational utilization of available resources including land assets.
\par <#/>c) Protection of the environment from degradation.
\par <#/>d) Conservation of ''sensitive' areas such as areas of biodiversity, etc. within the University land.
\par <#/>e) Preservation of aesthetic standards of the University.
\par <#/>Under "UDSM-2000" strategy, the University of DSM is anticipated to be transformed into a self-sustaining institution. <#/>This being the case, means should be sought to enable UDSM internally 
generate much more income so as to make it operational. <#/>To achieve this goal, one of the areas to be exploited is the UDSM land.
\par <#/>According to the 1987 Master Plan, 4.5% of the land is used for academic and administrative activities, 2.7% for studen
t residential facilities, 13 % for staff facilities, 4.5% other facilities and service buildings and 76% is for streams, valleys, forests and future expansion. <#/>On this account the proposed UDSM land use policy proposes that part of UDSM land, be devel
oped by inviting/allowing interested commercial developers from within UDSM community and outside to invest on the land.
\par <h> <#/>2.0 BACKGROUND </h>
\par <#/>There has never been any formal land use policy in existence before. <#/>However, in some cases UDSM ha
s managed to make arrangements to allow external organisations to utilise its land (e.g. BP Petrol Station). <#/>Our records indicate that most applications relating to commercial operation on UDSM Land were being turned down, perhaps the absence of a cle
arly defined Land Use Policy attributed to this.
\par <#/>Sometime back the Estates Committee directed the Estates department to prepare a proposal of special locations of sites for construction of sheds for small business. <#/>The aim of this was to avoid impro
per scattering of such sheds around the campus. <#/>Estates Department prepared plans of both site locations and type of building to be constructed. <#/>The original idea was that the cost of erecting these sheds were to be met by the UDSM after completio
n
 of which they would be rented to interested small businessmen. <#/>Due to lack of funds, the plan was frozen. <#/>Of recently, one of the biggest financial institutions in the country (i.e. the National Provident Fund (NPF) proposed to develop a housing 
s
cheme on the land of UDSM on the condition that they (NPF) be given Title deed of the piece of land to be developed and in consideration thereof, NPF surrender the ownership of the houses to UDSM but only after they have recovered the investment capital. 
<#/>The idea of transferring the title deed to NPF was disagreed by UDSM.
\par <#/>However, negotiations between UDSM and NPF are still going on but on a different Course, the UDSM is interested in NPF providing investment capital to be repaid by the government 
to finance construction of houses or student hostels without transferring the ownership of the title deed. <#/>But all in all, the main argument is whether UDSM should go on owning an undeveloped land or invite or join hand with interested commercial deve
lopers to invest on the land thereby generate some income and provide essential social services to the University Community.
\par <h> <#/>3.0 JUSTIFICATION </h>
\par <#/>The UDSM is facing financial constraints. <#/>The UDSM budget has been decreasing in real terms 
(See App. l). <#/>Even the average annual maintenance budget allocated by the government for maintenance of UDSM infrastructure is only 36% of the actual amount required. <#/>This maintenance, as the results, the physical condition of UDSM infrastructure,
 buildings and services has been deteriorating year after another.
\par <#/>The University authorities have for several years been concerned about the steady deterioration in the infrastructure, buildings, and services at the campus due mainly to lack of maintenance.
\par <#/>For example, financial constraints on the annual maintenance budgets over many years has made it very difficult for the Estates Department to carry out any planned or preventive maintenance to the extent that in 1982 it was realised that a major 
rehabilitation programme would be necessary if the valuable investment in buildings and infrastructure were to continue being of service to the Nation. <#/>The financial situation is not better for other activities such as for training, teaching facilitie
s, research, etc. <#/>Under these circumstances, the New Land Use Policy aims at facilitating the internal generation of income in terms of rent for UDSM which will utilized by topping up the UDSM budget.
\par <#/>Also, the proposed land use policy aims at providing essential services to the University Community.
\par <h> <#/>4.0 OBJECTIVES OF THE NEW LAND USE POLICY </h>
\par <#/>UDSM budget from the Government has been considerably scaled down. <#/>With funds currently allocated, only critical activities of UDSM are bei
ng carried out. <#/>Nobody expects significant changes on the trend of UDSM budget from the Government. <#/>It is imperative that UDSM looks into internal means of subsidising its budget.
\par <#/>The main objectives of the New Land Use Policy can be summarised as follows:
\par (i) Income generation in terms of rent aiming at facilitating self sustainability of the UDSM activities budget.
\par <#/>(ii) Provision of social services to UDSM community.
\par <h> <#/>5.0 IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY </h>
\par <#/>The land
 which is proposed for investment is a stretch along Sam Nujoma road and along both terminals of University road where it joins Sam Nujoma road. <#/>An area measuring 4.50 ha. is available. <#/>On the physical master plan an area of site in the North East
 
corner is allocated for junior staff housing, space is available for about 300 plots of 12 x 30 metres plot size. <#/>The land is more attractive and well ventilated than the higher areas to the west of the site. <#/>The area is well served with good tran
sportation system coupled with high purchasing power community, from the new housing areas to the east of University Campus.
\par <#/>Another area is the land measuring 3.02ha. to the South West of the main campus. <#/>This area is along the road leading to Changanyikeni.
\par <#/>Other areas for investment are UDSM plots located outside main campus such as Kunduchi Beach.
\par <#/>However in order to implement the proposed land use policy, UDSM master plan has been reviewed to incorporate areas identified for commercial purposes.
\par <#/>Due care has been made so that the principle aim of UDSM of provision of higher education is not jeopardised.
\par <#/>In this case the introduction of commercial zone has been made after considering that all other core functions - ie land for academic, administrative, residential, recreation sports, community services, forests, and for future expansion are satisfied.

\par <h> <#/>6.0 TYPE OF STRUCTURES TO BE ERECTED </h>
\par <#/>Depending on the nature of the business/investment to be undertaken , the University will determine the structures to be erected according to the UDSM standards.
\par <#/><h> 7.0 CATEGORIES OF BUSINESS TO BE OPERATED </h>
\par <#/>Proposed investment opportunities are listed hereunder:
\par - Housing investment
\par - Office accommodation
\par - Hostels
\par - Canteen/Restaurants
\par - Bookshop and stationary
\par - Secretarial services
\par - Warehouse
\par - Improvement of service/petrol station
\par - Any other business as will be deemed right by the Estates Committee.
\par <#/>However for investments within UDSM main campus the first priority will be given to business which are providing social services to the University Community and currently not present.
\par <h> <#/>8.0 APPOINTMENT AND DUTIES OF SUB-COMMITTEE </h>
\par <#/>The Estates Committee of the University Council has to appoint a specia
l sub-committee destined to dealing with land identification/allocation to would be investors/developers and scrutiny of business to be carried out according to specified conditions. <#/>Interested investors/developers intending to operate in one of the a
b
ove mentioned areas, will have to submit their applications to the Chief Administrative Officer of UDSM. <#/>The Chief Administrative Officer will in turn relay the applications to the sub-committee for scrutiny. <#/>The sub-committee will also prepare a 
report (recommending or declining the application) to the Estates Committee for further action and approval or disapproval.
\par <#/>When scrutinising the applications, the sub-committee should give particular emphasis on the following issues:
\par Type of service and quality to be rendered
\par Suitability of such services to UDSM community (i.e. is there any in existence already? or is it needed? or does it conflict with the current use
\par Quality and magnitude of services 
\par Availability of space
\par Space allocation and the relationship with the requirement of the Physical Master Plan.
\par <#/>Duration of tenure
\par Benefits to be gained by UDSM as compared to losses
\par The impact of the business to security and safety provisions
\par The impact on aesthetic value
\par Standard and type of structures to be erected
\par It will be the responsibility of prospective applicants to come up with the following details pertaining to construction of a structure on UDSM land.
\par <#/>Detailed drawing of a proposed structure according to the University standards.
\par <#/>Means of services provision i.e. water, telephone and power supply 
\par Size of plot - area in sq.m required 
\par Cost of construction/capital expenditure 
\par Means of drainage 
\par Name of contractor/builder to be employed to erect the structure 
\par Names of consultancy (if any) 
\par Construction period 
\par Anticipated date of starting business 
\par Estimated profits and turn-over of the business 
\par Source of financing or providing investment capital 
\par Expected period to recoup the capital
\par <#/>A feasibility st
udy for each intended investment opportunity will have to be carried out to come out with most productive and appropriate investment opportunity especially for those to be located at the main campus. <#/>The sub-committee will have to set out standards fo
r
 each particular item which will be considered in scrutinizing the applications, for instance in case of standard and type of structure it should be stated clearly that structures will be permanent for housing, offices, petrol/service stations. <#/>In cas
e of space to indicate clearly that for each particular business so much square metres will be allocated.
\par <#/>The sub-committee will also be concerned with periodic inspection of sites and rent <-/propasals>.
\par <h> <#/>9.0 MODE OF OWNERSHIP </h>
\par <#/>This pap
er proposes to invest on part of UDSM land earmarked for commercial activities. <#/>As indicated earlier, the major problem hindering development of UDSM land is lack of financial capital. <#/>By inviting developers/investors, UDSM expects them to provide
 
capital while UDSM provides land. <#/>UDSM has no intention to subdivide, assign, sublet or dispose part of her land. <#/>The development made on the land or premises constructed remain the property of UDSM. <#/>This may be right after completion or after
 recouping the capital within a period of not more than 20 years.
\par <h> <#/>10.0 MARKETING </h>
\par <#/>One of the aims of UDSM to invest on part of UDSM land is income generation.
\par <#/>Income generated from the proposed investments will be in terms of rent from premises constructed, profits or return generated from the business undertaken.
\par <#/>The rent charged will be market rent. <#/>An agreement will be made whereby the developer constructs the premises, then the property be rented to the developer or other ten
ants. <#/>The income generated will then be shared in an agreed ratio of say 1:3. <#/>UDSM to take 1 part as income and the developer takes 3 parts as profit generated or periodical payments to the capital outlay, until such period that the developer reco
vers her/his capital, when UDSM will be receiving the whole income.
\par <#/>10.1 Mode of inviting developers
\par One way which will be used to invite developers is by advertisement. <#/>This will be for specific areas like Kunduchi Beach.
\par <#/>For investments such as housing, hostels, offices, and warehouse, financial institutions, government/ parastatal organisations can be approached for total financing or joint venture.
\par <h> <#/>11.0 PROBLEMS OF IMPLEMENTATION </h>
\par <#/>It was pointed out in the introduction of this paper that of all the problems hindering development of UDSM land, the most serious one is the lack of financial capital. <#/>This proposal tries to alleviate this problem by recommending that interested 
developers be welcomed to invest on part of UDSM land or plots in order to provide capital.
\par <#/>(i) Introduction of a commercial zone may appear to be against user condition in this case application for consent to the commissioner of lands will be necessary
\par ii) It is likely that some of greedy investors may take advantage after getting the sites carry out different activities from those approved. <#/>In this case periodic inspection will be <-/neccessary>.
\par <#/>(iii) It is likely that some of the elements of the new land use policy may conflict with the present land uses. <#/>This factor will be considered in selection of investments.
\par <#/>(iv) Perception of the UDSM community on the policy, it is no wonder the tabloids will have the leading-"versity sells 20% of its land" and make fun out of it.
\par <#/>(v) Introduction/attraction of property taxes, other tariffs' hence negotiations have to be done before starting with relevant authorities.
\par <h> <#/>12.0 CONCLUSION </h>
\par <#/>The decrease of the University budget aff
ects the activities of the University and has an impact on its sustainability. <#/>UDSM is richly endowed with a vast piece of land parts of which are either completely unexploited or are very much under exploited. <#/>Such parts should be a focus for com
mercial development with a view to generating additional funds to top up the meagre allocated annually by the government.</I>

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 The meeting was opened by the President of the United Republic of Tanzania His Excellence Ali Hassan Mwinyi. <#/>In his speech the President commended the step taken by the University to 
initiate a process of transformation, that he termed, self-renewal and re-orientation.
\par <#/>He appreciated the problems that the University was facing as a result of the shrinking economy hence the continued inability of the government to sustain its high level of funding for higher education and for the education sector in general.
\par <#/>The President raised concern over the low levels of student enrolment at the University of Dar es Salaam compared to other Universities in the region which he attributed to the inability of the government to sponsor more students.
\par <#/>In the light of the existing limitations the President stated that the government support }{\b\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  the move and goals undertaken by the University. <#/>He suggested that the strategies to be a
dopted should be translated into the changes in organisation, financing and curricular of the University. <#/>These changes should aim at the production of original knowledge.
\par <#/>The President encouraged the University to take the self-financing mode and urged that the more the University supported itself financially the more secure it would be as it encounters the challenges of the 21st century.
\par <#/>The days program (attached) started with presentation of document A facts and figures.
\par <h> }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Document A: Facts and Figure </h>
\par Data set no. 2 has a lot of Computational errors. <#/>- Use intake instead of total enrollment - the drop-out rate should be based on a single academic year. <#/>- Degree courses should also include Muhimbili College of Health Sciences.
\par <#/>Data set 4 - why is Zimbabwe not included. <#/>- Establish a criteria for selecting the countries - Arrange the countries alphabetically. <#/>Maintain a list of the same countries for comparative purposes. <#/>Illustration 4 should read student/sta
ff ratio for selected African countries.
\par <#/>Data set 5 - Check on data for total establishment for example Faculty of Law, the Chief Academic Officer's Office, the University of Dar es Salaam Dispensary and double counting should be checked.
\par <#/>Data set 
6 - The set should correlate with data set number 2 - Check computation and use percentages instead of ratios. <#/>Include Muhimbili College especially the Institute of Allied Sciences which offers Diploma Courses. <#/>Check on the staff of the Institute 
and in some Departments of MUCHS whether they teach and whether they have the qualifications.
\par <#/>Data set 7 - If data is available, provide more detailed interval. <#/>For example for Zimbabwe data is available up to 1993.

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
It was expressed that there should be a distillation of the activities in the program in a separate document to show the direction the University is taking as well as the plans for implementation. <#/>The details would come from the various sections of th
e strategic plan.
\par <#/>The ideas in the corporate strategic plan should be circulated to the wider community of the University, as the document undergoes modifications.
\par <#/>A participant raised a point on the need for focusing on the objectives of the plan a
nd the importance of monitoring the process of implementing the plans. <#/>It was expressed that there is need also to show the performance indicators and concentrate on the question of efficiency, through the analysis of the unit cost.
\par <#/>Pointed out als
o that the values that students who pass through the University carry with them should also be considered. <#/>This may include for example the kind of leadership skills that they would need before they graduate. <#/>It will equip them more adequately in 
facing the new challenges in the world of employment.
\par <#/>Raised the question of the proposed structure and the concept of share holders. <#/>That there is need to give potential share holders the option of deciding whether they should continue remaining as share holders or opting out after some time.
\par <#/>In order to motivate people to behave according to the objectives embedded in the process of transforming the organisational culture it is important to create a system with proper incentives for the workers.
\par <#/>The section on the mission of the University was criticized for still being deficient. <#/>For example the questions at the bottom of page 3 may need to be answered. <#/>This would make it more elaborate. <#/>It was also proposed that the concept of 
"partnership in Education is equal to partnership in Development" should be changed to "Partnership in Education = to Commitment to Education. <#/>Prof. Baregu was commissioned by the chairman to provide an elaborated and expanded version of the concept.

\par <#/>In connection with the transformation of organisational culture it was argued that there is need to cultivate the culture of excellence and merit.
\par <#/>This should be added to the list. <#/>It will only be possible by introducing an appropriate incentive scheme that will encourage the habit of excellence it was argued.
\par <#/>A participant strongly stressed that the analysis of the situation using SWOT should be undertaken wholly. <#/>It should be spelled out in the paper showing out the strengths, weaknesse
s, opportunities and threats instead of simply mentioning it. <#/>It should not be mentioned as a task to be undertaken later but details should appear in strategic plan.
\par <#/>A question was raised in connection to the rationale for the process of transform
ation. <#/>It was not clear whether the draft strategic plan did consider the vision for the society as well. <#/>This appears not to have not been considered. <#/>Where on page 13 the document mentions other societal parties as interested groups, the soc
i
ety should be considered as the users of the university product. <#/>Inevitably the process of transformation will have to be linked to the reviewing of the entire education system in Tanzania. <#/>Prof. S. S. Mushi was commissioned to write a short text 
and clarify on this opinion.
\par <#/>The difficulty involved in obtaining information as well as the magnitude of the work that the University has undertaken was appreciated. <#/>It was mentioned however that Zambia University has also gone through the process 
of transformation but not as drastic as that of UDSM. <#/>It is worth learning from them also. <#/>Wondered whether the concept of (PLC's) was not difficult to implement especially that government policy has not yet changed. <#/>Asked also on the extent t
o which donors were ready to support the approach/ concept of PLC's as applied to the running of Universities.
\par <#/>Some participants also asked whether there had been any informal discussions between the UDSM and the government on the proposal for making th
e University a PLC. <#/>Suggested that there was need to learn from how other institutions operate before the idea could be presented to government. <#/>Thus the private sector, the public sector and the society in general should be clearly understood in 
order to provide the necessary information.
\par <#/>It was also recommended that using terms that carry value judgement in a document like the strategic plan should be avoided.
\par <#/>Noted that the question of gender was missing and had not been adequately addressed. <#/>This it was important include a gender dimension in the draft.
\par <#/>Suggested that there was need for a calendar of activities to show how UDSM will go about managing the activities in the transformation program. <#/>It is also important to show wh
at can be offered to other countries/universities which would like to co-operate with the University of Dar es Salaam. <#/>The role of external as well as internal donors should be made clear.
\par <#/>Although the government is a major funding agent, it was elaborated that other ministries also have government funding and the reason for including other ministries as shareholders is that the University would like to tap these funds.
\par <#/>In this connection agencies that sponsor students abroad have been requested to rationalize this and sponsor the student to the University of Dar es Salaam instead, at an economic fee.
\par <#/>The initiative undertaken by the University was commended and the participant underscored that it was impressive that the process was going on.
 <#/>It was added that the clarifications that were being provided during the presentations helped a great deal in making the document understandable to the participants.
\par <#/>A participant pointed out that donors have also contributed significantly in the fragmentation of resources in Universities. <#/>They were requested to restructure/reform their practices.
\par <#/>UDSM was congratulated for initiating the institutional process of change. <#/>Although the ideas and solutions being articulated are fascinating
 they should be thoroughly discussed with the wider community. <#/>The major obstacle that the University is likely to face is resistance to new ideas. <#/>There can also be another problem in the form of lack of continuity and sustainability for example 
the University may have a person who could easily dismiss the idea of institutional transformation without considering the efforts that have already been invested in it.
\par <#/>A participant suggested in connection with the concept of PLC that perhaps there is
 need to use concepts which show that people also have a role in the running of the University. <#/>Using the concept of a PLC may create the impression that the general public has nothing to do with the University.
\par <#/>Suggested that more elaboration may 
be needed concerning the question of job seekers. <#/>This takes into account that currently not all <-_graduate><+_graduates> secure employment in the public sector. <#/>There is need for a clear diagnosis to establish the nature of the problem. <#/>For 
example does the problem lie with the curriculum or with the entire education system?
\par <#/>It was suggested that in fact the University should <-_continues><+_continue> to produce both job-seekers and job-creators, because the notion of job creators has not yet been thought of thoroughly.
\par <#/>A participant cautioned on the dangers of confusing the process, and said that there are two levels at which the process can be perceived. <#/>There is the process of developing a national policy framework which is the j
ob of the government and secondly there is the process of institutional transformation which is the job of the University. <#/>These should be made distinctively clear because the job of the University aims to undertake is already big enough.
\par <#/>Three important things were mentioned, to be taken into consideration in order to make the transformation process a success.
\par <#/>- Firstly the university cannot operate without an adequate infrastructure and apparently building up the infrastructure would depend on the support from the donor community.
\par <#/>- Secondly there is also need for the university to get members of staff who are committed to doing research and consultancy. <#/>Research and consultancy run the University.
\par <#/>- Thirdly the university would need the strong commitment of the government financially. <#/>For over 30 years the government has been committed and it has produced results.
\par <#/>A participant asked why no answers were being provided to some questions that had been raised concerning issues like the philosophy behind the corporate strategic plan.
\par <#/>The concept of PLC's and the question of reorganizing the University structures. <#/>It was answered that so far this a joint process of formulating a vision for the University and <-/no body> has the answers.
\par <h> }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Document D: Program Outline, Report and Plan of Action.</h>
\par Asked about the possibility of coming up with some precise figures in the planning of the programs activities. <#/>Such as planning for the infrastructure.
\par <#/>Maintained that the success of the program will depend on the financial volume available to the University. <#/>The government and the wider community s
hould be able to indicate the proportion of the government budget that it commits to higher education and to the University in particular.
\par <#/>Challenged the Department of Economics to try to develop a formular or a mechanism through which it will make it possible to show the cost of doing something as opposed to the cost of not doing it.
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {\lang1031 <#/>Reiterated the need for having a big thrust of support for some areas including the Sciences. <#/>Enrolment in the Sciences is currently decreasing so there is need fo
r more support. <#/>It is high time also that the University started thinking in terms of North-South relationship. <#/>There is need to think in terms of investing into higher education because there are countries which are investing in higher education.

\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang1031 {\fs24 
<#/>Suggested that the strategy that should be adopted in order for the University to cross the bridge is to do more with the little that is available while waiting for the enabling environment to grow and develop.

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 The closing cer
emony was performed by the Chancellor of the University of Dar es Salaam, His Excellency Ambassador Paul Bomani. <#/>In his Closing Speech the Chancellor promised and assured the University to devote its energy and experience toward the well-being of the 
University despite what has been said about his appointment.
\par <#/>He reiterated the role of the University as that of producing first class graduates who will professionally and competently manage the Tanzanian economy in the <-_pubic><+_public> as well as t
he private sector. <#/>Hence urged the University to produce job-creators rather than job-seekers.
\par <#/>Appealed to the University Management and Leadership to motivate teachers by creating conducive environment for the task of teaching, research and consultancy.
\par <#/>The task of mobilization of resources to support the transformation process is a vital one. <#/>The University should try to work out this as soon as possible.
\par <#/>Cautioned that during this transformation process the values of our society are also be questioned }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 
and tested. <#/>Tanzania should maintain her sense of Justice and fair play. <#/>The best place where these can be inculcated, he suggested, is in the home and educational institutions thus the University should be in the forefront.
\par <#/>Ambassador Bomani encouraged the practice of broad base participation and involvement of as many people as possible in the affairs of the University through - public speakers "Human interaction is essential in solving problems." </I>
