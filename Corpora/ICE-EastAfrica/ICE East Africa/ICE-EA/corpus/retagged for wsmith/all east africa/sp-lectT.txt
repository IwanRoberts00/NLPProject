<$B> Your Excellency Mr Chancellor President of Convocation Ministers Excellencies Vice-Chancellors Ladies and Gentlemen I had the honour of inviting you once before to participate at a very important function that took place at this University when we granted degrees in December last year but my duty is RRRis not less honorous today is less honorous but equally important uh This here is the first time uh during this the last ten years that we've had your presence here to address a seminar of this quality and this importance and this significance to the people of Tanzania and we think it earmarks uh a series of events which will gradually help transfer some of the social evils that we suffer from by action being taken appropriately at the appropriate place And nothing is going to assist this and help this more than a frank discussion on the subject that's been selected under the Presidency of our young Juma Mwapachu who became our President in nineteen eighty-eight I think he needs to be congratulated for the active manner in which he has been able to uh RRRto RRRto promote the activities of uh this uh gathering We have amongst us Mr Vice Mr Chancellor some members of the diplomatic corps They happen to be ex-alumnae too particularly our friend from the Canadian High from the Kenya High Commission uh We are present IIIprese pleased to have here with us other ambassadors and High Commissioners as well This uh seminar would not have been possible had it not been for the active and constant intellectual assistance that we've received over the last thirty years And really it is the last thirty years from a group of countries who stand out for uh remarkably in this respect uh I'm talking about Norway Denmark and Sweden through their agencies NORAD DANIDA and SIDA
They have been the backbone to the University in many respects and I hope in the next few years ahead once we are making an attempt to revitalise the activities of the University that they will continue to show us the support which they have given in the past and that others will emulate their style in giving us the kind of assistance we need in order to be able to perform the way we should as a University of Dar es Salaam and the premier University of Tanzania Your Excellency Mr Chancellor on behalf of this gathering here I have the great honour and pleasure of inviting you to address us Thank you

Mr Chairman of the seminar distinguished Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organisation Mr UUUBokscher Honourable Ministers Your Excellencies distinguished workshop participants ladies and gentlemen it is a great honour and a privilege for me to be invited to come and officially open this national workshop on copyright and neighbouring right I'm particularly delighted that this occasion is attended by the Director General of the World Intellectual Property IIIOrga Organisation Doctor UUUBokscher who will also address this workshop Please you are most welcome to Tanzania On behalf of the government and the people of the Republic of Tanzania I wish to welcome our distinguished guests from outside Tanzania to Tanzania and particularly to the city of Dar es Salaam Mr Chairman this workshop is on copyright and neighbouring rights From your programme it is evident that you will IIIco will be covering a wide range of coverage related to copyright and neighbouring rights I'm certain this an area of immense importance to the literal and artistic work in developing countries and especially to our country Tanzania Mr Chairman distinguished guest I do not profess to be an expert  of><+_on> intellectual property matters but I am aware of the fact that literal and artistic works originating in developing countries particularly Africa have been taped by nationals and institutions in the developed countries without even acknowledging their original source let alone paying BBBlet alone payingRRR or in other cases adequately paying for such rights This is not only exploitation but outright cheating for profit It denies the actual owner of the the right BBBof theRRR rights getting a fair return and rightful recognition for their contribution to the pleasure of such works given to mankind Mr Chairman we must BBBwe mustRRR heed the outcry of our literal and artistic creators now The <O/> in the recognition and the participation in the various copyright conventions and treaties ought to be checked now Let this workshop be the first step in that direction Distinguished participants the mere fact that we are not members of some of the treaties administered by the World Intellectual Property Organisation should not be construed to mean that we are against them We are aware of the disadvantages of not being members and would like to become conversant with all the technicalities as we take the necessary steps towards joining or rather acceding to such treaties This workshop has thus come at an opportune moment Mr Chairman The expertise kindly provided by the World Intellectual Property Organisation and the wide representation offered by participants should enable this workshop to come up with recommendations that can help the government of the United Republic of Tanzania to review the copyright role and approach the treaties relating to intellectual property with greater clarity At this juncture I wish to commend the steps already taken by the National Arts Council the steps taken by the cultural sector to review the IIIcopy RRRthe copyright act of nineteen sixty-six both of which have come up with proposals for updating the act and suggesting and suggestions for proper IIIadmin administering copyright matters in this country Let me repeat again the suggestions from this uh workshop would definitely be very much welcomed by the government of the United Republic of Tanzania In addition Mr Chairman this workshop should help publicise the rights of the inventors literal and artistic creators on the one hand and sensitise public copyright and neighbouring rights on the other Now Mr Chairman before I declare this workshop open allow me to say a few words about our guest Doctor IIIBou IIIBoksh UUUBokscher and his organisation and his colleagues from Geneva Mr Director General your organisation has made many important strides under your very able leadership Your organisation's unconditional willingness

Mr Chairman Distinguished Party and Government Leaders Mr Vice Chancellor Members of the Academic Staff and Students Honourable Guests Distinguished Alumnae of the University of Dar es Salaam Distinguished participants Ladies and Gentlemen I would like first of all to express my sincere thanks to the executive committee of the convocation of the University of Dar es Salaam for inviting me to open this *honorative> seminar I would also like to extend a hearty welcome to those of you from the donor community and those who have come from the regions to take part in this seminar The fact that this seminar has attracted participants from the donors and from outside Dar es Salaam is a measure of the degree of concern solidarity and interest in solving the serious social service delivery problems facing our country On behalf of the Government of Tanzania I thank you for your great concern Let me single out the Vice-Chancellor the organising committee and the sponsors the Nordic countries for making this seminar possible Let me take this opportunity to congratulate this university on this happy occasion of its twentieth anniversary Twenty years is not a very short period of time especially for such an important institution of higher learning in a young nation like ours which is in the process of implementing important development goals This university has an important role to play in the implementation of those development goals The government acknowledges and highly appreciates the invaluable contribution which this university has made to the development of our country during these twenty years of existence We especially appreciate its contribution to the fulfilment our nation's commitment to achieve self-sufficiency in high level manpower needs Since its establishment the University has produced a large number of lawyers teachers economists sociologists political scientists doctors and engineers About fifteen thousand experts have graduated from this University That has helped to increase the level of localisation of middle and high level manpower from twenty-six per cent to ninety-nine per cent between independence and nineteen eighty Today the majority of people holding positions of great responsibility in this country are graduates from this university What makes this IIIw BBBwhat makes thisRRR seminar truly historic is that it has brought together some of those people who owe a great deal to this university in terms of their educational attainments I'm pleased to see you here and thank you for your contribution to the development of our country The university itself as an institution has made and continues to make a valuable contribution to the development of our country through its research work workshops seminars and thought-provoking academic papers The holding of this seminar is part of the commemoration of RRRof its IIItwenti twentieth anniversary is yet another proof of the university's continued efforts to make a positive contribution to our national efforts to improve the well-being of our people The theme of this seminar Crisis of Social Services Delivery in Tanzania and Strategies for More Sustainable System in the nineteen nineties is both timely and relevant This theme is relevant because the provision of essential social services to the people has been the IIIcons RRRthe consistent commitment of the government of Tanzania since nineteen sixties In implementing that policy the government has invested substantial resources in the field of education health housing water supply and sanitation That was done with the valuable support and assistance of friendly countries some of which are represented at this seminar We thank them all for their assistance The results achieved are spectacular In the first two decades of our nation's history we managed to attain provision levels which received world-wide recognition In the field of education a massive universal primary education programme and adult education managed to raise our average literacy level from a low ten per cent in nineteen sixty-one to the present enviable level of ninety per cent The number of enrolment in primary schools as a IIIper RRRa percentage of the school age has increased from twenty per cent to ninety-three per cent The spectacular expansion of this university is a good example of the government's commitment to promote higher education in our country The expansion has been in both the number of enrolment and in the number of faculties The University started with five faculties and one institute Today it has seven faculties and five institutes In the field of health and nutrition an extensive facility network based on the cost on the least cost preventive approach was set up A health system based on village workers dispensaries rural health centres district regional and referral hospitals was established The number of rural health centres rose from twenty-two to two hundred and sixty Dispensaries increased from eight hundred and seventy-five to four thousand six hundred and seventy-six and hospitals from one hundred and nineteen to one hundred and forty-nine That system greatly improved the access of all Tanzanians including those in the rural areas to modern health services The population served by one physician improved by twenty-two per cent and dropped from two IIIthous- twenty-four thousand seven hundred to nineteen thousand two hundred and eighty The population served by one nurse improved remarkably and dropped fivefold from eleven thousand eight hundred ninety to a mere two thousand one hundred and IIIfo and eighty-four Generally life expectancy at birth improved from thirty-five to fifty years Infant mortality rate was reduced from about one hundred and ninety about to about one thirty-seven per one thousand live births As for water sector the objective was to IIIprov to provide clean water to all the population in a thirty year programme spanning between nineteen seventy-one and two thousand and two It was hoped that by nineteen eighty seventy five per cent of the rural population would be served with clean water Although this target was not reached by nineteen eighty eighty per cent of the urban population and forty-five per cent of the rural population had access to modern water services Mr Chairman in brief the achievements made in the development of those vital social services are remarkable Unfortunately the severe economic crisis which our country has been experiencing over the last decade has greatly eroded our ability to maintain them and have therefore sharply deteriorated The manifestation of that deterioration are not hard to find The poor state of our physical infrastructure especially road and railways is a constant reminder of the IIIinfa uh unfavourable economic situation prevailing in our country The networks of health services now perform poorly because of the lack of medicines and equipment Most water projects no longer function for lack of spare parts Equally affected by the economic crisis are our schools and universities which are faced with an acute shortage of teaching aids and books As part of the Tanzanian community the University of Dar es Salaam has not been spared from that effect of the current RRRcurrent economic crisis That could be seen from the delapidated buildings and deterioration of essential services to the university community I'm pleased to note that work to rehabilitate those buildings is going on well Mr Chairman the persistent economic decline compelled the government to take difficult economic adjustments and recovery measures with the hope of reversing the negative trend I know that members of this audience are well versed with the measures taken Some of you have even conducted an assessment of the success of those measures So I will not waste your time by repeating them However I would like to point out that implementation of those measures has produced positive signs for economic recovery Implementation of the first phase of the economic recovery programme ERP has especially helped to improve both agricultural and industrial production That has greatly reduced widespread shortages of essential commodities The spectacular increase in agricultural production has enabled our country to achieve food self-sufficiency and increase the volume of export commodities Industrial production has also increased by five per cent As a result of the increase in IIIagric agricultural and industrial production our gross domestic product has registered for the first time since nineteen seventy-eight an average of annual growth rate of four point one per cent well above the two per cent rate of population growth It is obvious from the foregoing that during the first phase of the ERP greater emphasis was placed on the improvement of production That was done in order to avert the danger of widespread hunger and to reduce the shortage of industrial goods In view of the limited resources at our disposal it was not possible to allocate adequate resources for the rehabilitation and improvement of social services at the same time As a result people continued to IIIexpe experience hardships That unfavourable situation compelled the government to adopt the priority of social action programme as a second phase of the ERP While in the first phase emphasis was put on improving production in the second phase emphasis is put on the rehabilitation and improvement of the greatly deteriorated social services In short the priority social action programme is intended to achieve the following objectives One to make institutional management and reforms which can improve the delivery of social services by creating an <O/> environment for improved efficiency accountability and mobilisation of community support and hence sustainability Two to restore an adequate supply of and effective demand for basic instructional materials in schools and to improve the learning environment by IIIreheb rehabilitating the delapidated buildings including those of this campus Three to restore an adequate supply of essential drugs and health care equipment in order to safeguard standards of provision of universal basic health services Four to rehabilitate the existing water facilities in order to provide improved access to safe water Five to improve the IIIdistrib the IIIre the distribution of food from surplus areas to deficit areas so as to reduce the wide IIImark marketing regions margins between producer and consumer prices for staple foodstuffs Six to accelerate the creation of employment and income-generating activities in small-scale manufacturing and services Seven to support community-based public work schemes to create employment opportunities for low income people and improve their access to food and other essential goods and services with preference being given to women Eight to provide nutritional safety nets if necessary for families who are unable to earn enough to buy on adequate an adequate amount of food Mr Chairman the government recognises that implementation of this phase as was the case for the first phase requires a massive injection of resources Unfortunately the country's revenue IIIreg uh generating capacity especially foreign exchange has not improved sufficiently enough to enable the government to allocate adequate resources to the social sector Our ability to earn sufficient uh foreign exchange continues to be affected by the persistent decline in world prices of our major export commodities and sharp increases in the prices of essential IIIimpor imports including those required to improve social services It is therefore a matter of great satisfaction that the friendly countries and international  organisation><+_organisations> which gave us valuable IIIexper uh assistance during the implementation of the first phase have also agreed to continue to help us with the implementation of the second phase For that reason I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of the government and people of Tanzania and on my own behalf to express our deep gratitude to those countries and  organisation><+_organisations> for their valuable assistance I would like to stress however that as much as we do appreciate the available assistance from our friends the rehabilitation IIIimpro the rehabilitation improvement and maintenance of our social services remain the primary responsibility of the Tanzanians themselves each and everyone of us A more sustainable strategy for social service delivery must therefore be based on the active mobilisation and utilisation of our local resources and the intensification of our own efforts in compliance with our policy of socialism and self-reliance It is for that reason that the government continues to put great emphasis on communities' own responsibility for their basic social services through self-help schemes Mr Chairman the priority action programme is now in its second year of implementation Those of you gathered here may wish to conduct a critical review of the progress so far made in the implementation of the programme Such a BBBsuch aRRR review would indeed be appropriate because this seminar has fortunately attracted participants from the IIIdon the donor community the regions academicians participants practitioners and high level public officials who are well versed with the crisis in our social services sector I feel confident that your review will help to identify those bottlenecks which hinder progress and recommend implementable measures which would help accelerate progress towards better services to our people I wish to ensure you that the government will give serious consideration to all your recommendations I therefore wish RRRwish you fruitful deliberations and declare the second seminar of the Convocation of the University of Dar es Salaam officially opened Thank you for your attention

So uh yeah so I'm going to to try to give an analysis on the future of cooperatives with the development of <O/> agriculture in Tanzania uh My presentation will be divided into three parts The first I always try to expose the problem itself IIIre relating to the future of uh peasant cooperatives The second will be trying to show historical perspective of the position and the role of peasant cooperatives and then the third will be just a conclusion as to what I think will be the future in terms of position and role of peasant cooperatives So beginning with the first part uh one aspect which is quite obvious to those who have come across the history of peasant cooperatives or development of cooperatives in Tanzania is that from the nineteen fifties uh during the period of IIIGer British colonialism uh peasant cooperatives assumed at least began to assume a monopoly a monopolistic role in the marketing of peasant crops and particularly uh the export crops uh Before that of course uh the people who were going into the marketing of peasant crops were private traders uh the so-called middleman traders who used to purchase peasant crops uh and sell them to the big uh export companies and that was the structure from the period of German colonialism to the first phase of British colonialism but in the nineteen IIIfif fifties the cooperatives began to take over particularly in the area of export crops the so-called cash crops that is coffee tea cotton pyrethrum tobacco cashnuts So that's where they began to assume the monopoly Now this has continued this RRRthis monopolistic tendency has continued uh up to the nineteen nineteen eighties so with the structural adjustment programme liberalisation in the privatisation programmes which we have been discussing here since RRRsince yesterday So changes have begun to take place and these changes include uh now that private people again uh IIIwhere whereby the cooperatives in from the nineteen-fifties took over uh from the private traders Now they come in They RRRthey come in again to play the same role they used to play in the past uh the marketing of peasant crops uh which means that uh from the mid-eighties uh up to now we have this development whereby uh private traders side by side with cooperatives uh are competing But there is a need to qualify the extent of that competition the extent to which that competition has reached up to this stage uh It is still at its lower level of development in the sense that much of the export IIIcrop crops traditional export crops have developed a system which is such that uh it's not easy for the private traders just to get in uh certain infrastructure structures If you have tobacco uh the RRRthe RRRthe cooperatives or the marketing boards own uh the processing plants so a private trader to take over the marketing of tobacco will not be that RRRthat much easy Then there are <O/> IIIcoff the beginning of RRRof RRRof RRRof cotton uh and and other crops so RRRso the level the extent to which uh the private people are entering into the competition very much depends on the BBBon theRRR nature of the crop uh on the circumstance of a particular area This one is as such most of them the competition has much more developed in terms of fruit crops rather than in terms of uh traditional export crops Although even in that area still there are struggles uh For instance just by last year uh the regional governments of <name/> and <name/> uh decided to allow private traders to enter into the marketing of cashnuts which up to now are still under the monopoly of cooperatives the <name/> Cooperative Union and the <name/> Cooperative Union who sell to the uh regional cashnut uh IIIpro product uh marketing board so that possibly this year the nineteen ninety-three ninety-four year uh the private traders are expected to be allowed to enter into that competition and in <name/> for instance the private traders have managed to take over completely the marketing of of cacao Now cacao is a new BBBa newRRR crop there so it's not yet developed into a larger scale so it has been easy for the private traders Mohammed and Enterprise Limited has taken over completely from the <name/> and <name/> marketing union So <name/> and <name/> marketing union are remaining for the marketing of rice and uh uh coffee and uh cacao has been taken over by a private firm So uh this <O/> just some sure examples to show the way the process is going but then in the area food although also there RRRthere are some BBBthere areRRR BBBthere are someRRR RRRsome problems uh For instance in the four so-called four big IIIreg <O/> regions of <name/> Mbeya Rukwa and Iringa uh much of the maize for instance which is BBBwhich isRRR sold to Dar es Salaam is bought by private traders there but part of it is still through cooperatives who sell to the National Union Cooperation you see So you you still have in the fruit crop area uh this competition in developing Now the RRRthe uh RRRthe actual problem is is RRRis RRRis that uh uh first on the part of the cooperatives  Historical><+_Historically> the cooperatives were particular cooperative unions were abolished nineteen seventy-six and then the uh crop authorities took over the position of crop uh uh cooperative unions so that it was the crop authorities which were now buying crops from primary cooperative societies in the villages which were now part of <O/> the development <O/> So the RRRthe effect of that abolition in nineteen seventy-six and then re-establishment of the IIIco IIIco cooperative unions in nineteen eighty-two uh uh after the act of nineteen eighty-two resulted  into><+_in> a situation whereby the cooperative unions began anew on a very weak capital base because when they were BBBthey wereRRR abolished they were abolished that BBBsudden<+_suddenly> by RRRby RRRby the order of the government and then all their uh property financial uh movable the movable property was handed over to crop authorities So when they were re-established maybe they could get again the immovable property such as buildings uh but the movable and the BBBand theRRR financial capital uh was no longer there and therefore they had to start at a BBBat aRRR very weak position IIIcap in terms of capital base to be able to to market peasant crops So the result of that they had to depend now borrowing from the National Bank of Commerce and the uh Cooperative Rural Development Bank in order to get financed to be able to purchase uh crops from the peasants So this tendency developed to the extent that uh because of the high rate of RRRof RRRof interest which they had to pay and also coupled with the corruption which developed within the cooperative unions themselves so the uh RRRthe RRRthe there was a rapid rise of debts to the extent that by nineteen eighty-nine about eighty-fifty IIIeigh uh uh a survey of only seven cooperative unions amounted to a debt of fifteen billion shillings uh The cooperative unions could not pay and therefore the banks began to be strict the cooperative unions so they had now to buy crops on credit so you RRRyou RRRyou RRRyou go to the peasants uh uh uh in fact by RRRby last year the their cooperative unions were negotiating very seriously to convince the peasants uh to RRRto RRRto sell their crops uh to the cooperative union on credit and you heard then their coffee is RRRis RRRis RRRis sold on the world market When the money comes then they can pay the peasants And this has created a lot of problems in terms of relationship between the peasants and the cooperatives So this is uh one problem on the side of the cooperatives And then on the side of the private traders uh a rough survey indicates that only RRRonly very few traders with strong capital base uh such as Mohammed and Enterprise and others but the majority are just petty traders who have very weak capital base So it is feasible when you go along the many roads to collect the maize to collect I don't know what uh and then uh sell it to the areas uh where they are demanded Now the problem is that uh these traders have not been able to satisfy uh the RRRthe RRRthe RRRthe RRRthe marketing needs of the crops For one because of the transport infrastructure problem If they go uh deeper into the BBBinto theRRR villages where you have got problems of transport that means uh transport expense will be very high and therefore they only choose areas where you have got easy access of transport and therefore they can only uh purchase uh crops from one part of the peasants but the majority of the peasants have no access to these traders So this is uh one problem Given the weak capital base they can't buy large quantities So there have been cases where the cooperatives because of this also the cooperatives having financial problems they could not purchase crops from the peasants such as maize and because again the private traders have the weak capital base most of them they could not satisfy uh uh the RRRthe supply of RRRof crops from the peasants So you have a crisis situation and uh there are and and up to now there is no clear BBBthere is no clearRRR government policy or guidance to regulate this type of competition So this is uh one of the aspects of the problem But the other uh is that also connected with the private traders is the fact that the private traders are only interested in the crops while cooperatives had two roles purchasing crops from the peasants marketing them and then ensuring that the peasants get uh some IIIne IIInec necassary inputs such as fertilizer uh and other uh necessary inputs But uh private traders have no interest  on><+_in> that and therefore their interest is just to buy the crops So where cooperatives withdraw RRRuhu the peasants have got a problem of getting inputs and the example I've told you about the cacao is facing that problem so that the Mohammed Enterprise Limited uh is only interested in the buying of the crop and exporting it rather than helping the peasants also to get seedlings and other necessary items So anyway in short I wanted just the first part to expose this the nature uh of the problem itself So coming to the second part is that cooperatives and this I will be just brief the history of cooperatives peasant cooperatives in Tanzania begins uh from the nineteen nineteen-twenties and it begins through the initiative there of the RRRthe RRRthe farmers themselves the peasants particularly the peasants who were involved in the production of export crops and this is partly as a struggle against the middlemen traders The peasants IIIcom perceived that the middlemen traders were responsible for giving them very low uh prices for their crops and therefore they were exploiting them so consequently uh peasants began to organise themselves so that they could take over the marketing of their crops So peasant associations began to be formed so that by nineteen twenty-four you had the IIIBa RRRthe uh uh RRRthe Bukoba Bahara Union nineteen twenty-five you had the Kilimanjaro Native Planters Association uh later on you had the <name/> Association Iringa you had the Meru Growers Association uh and uh in Mwanza you had also Cotton Growers Association These were organised by the peasants themselves independent of the government So that was the beginning So this was the first stage in the development of cooperatives So when the British colonial government saw that development uh it found that it was not easy uh to abolish this uh mushrooming of peasant associations and uh given the fact that at the same period the British had also this policy of establishing peasant cooperatives in other colonies So they found it's RRRit's better to controls to control the associations peasant association instead of leaving them independent and autonomous That was a threat to the whole uh colonial system uh particularly the economic system and therefore in nineteen thirty-two uh the British government decided to enact a law uh the Cooperative Societies Ordinance of nineteen thirty-two which made sure that all peasant associations had to be registered as cooperative uh organisations under that law But then the process of registering uh was not complete That's why you still had some other independent associations being formed up to around nineteen fifty-two So between nineteen thirty-two and nineteen fifty-two only two uh peasant cooperative associations were RRRwere registered as cooperatives and that was uh the Kilimanjaro Native uh Cooperative Union uh which was The RRRthe Kilimanjaro Native Planters Association was now registered and changed its name into the Kilimanjaro Native Cooperative Union nineteen thirty-three and nineteen thirty-six uh the <O/> Cooperative Union uh uh which was also registered under this So up to nineteen fifty-two these were the two Otherwise others were still independent and autonomous peasant associations So by nineteen fifty-two the government made sure that all these associations uh had to be registered as peasant cooperatives and uh this time coincided with also the nationalist movement which also encouraged the formation of more peasant cooperatives uh because they very much supported the nationalist movement and therefore you had a rapid expansion of peasant cooperatives between nineteen fifty-two and nineteen sixty-one to the time of independence

Because almost everything that I'd have said has been said and uh that but since I'm RRRI'm the only person in a way in this room a bureaucrat who is <slang/>gonna try to act the academic so I thought I'd say something just from that perspective uh and I'll do that by looking at the RRRthe changing <O/> of state of agro-pastoralism and the agro-pastoralism I'm referring to is this term in which agriculture and livestock keeping have almost an equal uh social economic and uh political value to the people that practise it as opposed to mixed farming where there could be livestock and IIIre real farming and uh as has been presented already in previous presentations changes in Tanzania since independence uh have been tremendous We had over ninety per cent of our population living in the rural areas Now we are told it's less about eighty per cent so with a growing urbanisation uh the population that is living in the rural areas is getting smaller but it is still predominant and quite significant and uh at independence agro-pastoralism was limited to a number of places like Karange Mwanza Shinyanga <O/> Iminara region among the <name/> and then among the <name/> then we had only a number of <O/> and then the Turu and all these places we have agro-pastoralists but then we have the pastoral peoples according to researches in the sixties by colleague <name/> and that is among the Barbaig the Barbaig who are groups who are still pastoral You have the Massai They are pastoral Of course the Arusha agro-pastoral around Mount RRRMount Meru so you have IIIagro-pastoral agro-pastoralists in certain areas pastoralism in others and cultivators shifting cultivators in other areas and when you look at the tribal the so-called tribal map drawn in the late fifties it could show you where the Sukuma are living where the Haya are living where the Massai are living all over the country and you could be told they are <O/> they are <O/> et cetera et cetera so you had a landscape which was very clearly limited in terms of geographic collocations of these people so this production system in Tanzania three decades ago was limited to particular areas which were known and in other places like southern Tanzania the biggest in <name/> was the goat They've never seen cattle and some of them saw cattle for the first time in the BBBin theRRR seventies through government policy and actually they were afraid of milking these animals Now uh what we have now in the three decades is the expansion of IIIagro RRRagro agro-pastoralism That's why I'm talking of a changing landscape in the sense that agro-pastoralism the map we have now is different from the map we had at independence of this production system The agro-pastoralism has now burst its borders in terms of the Sukuma who were known to be in Mwanza and Shinyanga They have systematically moved through the <name/> area into some <name/> plains and into the RRRinto Morogoro region where they are keeping herds of cattle and practising <O/> We have the RRRthe BBBWe have the RRRtheRRR Arusha people who have moved into a mostly entire Massai land where they are practising cultivation in the higher potential areas like we were told the mountain areas or the highland areas where you have BBByou haveRRR <O_><O/> These have been occupied or colonalized by agro-pastoral Arusha in Massai land but they practise agriculture So on the one hand we have the migration and expansion of agro-pastoralism where it has BBBit has<_/> been moving physically by people of those communities which were located particularly as in the past moving out with their herds and with their agriculture into new areas so we have some plains which have been occupied now by the Sukuma We have the Mwanzi moving to those areas and in RRRin Morogoro area where we have quite a substantial amount of people from those RRRthose places So this is one phenomenon The other one is where you have pastoralism emerging in former pastoral areas agricultural development and uh pastoral communities have been known of course to consume agricultural goods for a long time People travelled through Massai land in the BBBin theRRR eighteen-eighties We are saying that the Massai were exchanging their RRRtheir pastoral products for agricultural goods Even during war they will BBBthey willRRR send their women to collect agro-pastoral goods So it's not a phenomenon that is new depending on some of agricultural produce but they never produced these crops themselves They bartered again with other communities and other people and literature on the <name/> or in literature sometimes they are called <name/> they were cultivating and after the wars of the Massai in the eighteenth century they were looked down as people practising agriculture by the other Massai because these were infiltrating These are keeping livestock and nothing else and these others are doing some cultivation and uh so you have this division RRRdivision now there is a trend to move <O/> agriculture in the pastoral areas not depending on the food <O/> but being able to grow them themselves So what I am studying here is not the well-known fact that agriculture has been transported into pastoral areas by land-hungry cultivators agro-pastoralists and commercial farmers and the state projects I am looking into process in which hitherto pastoral communities have or are gradually taking up agriculture for their purpose of dealing with their different needs The reasons are new One Mr Chairman is that productivity of their pastoral system has declined in many parts of Tanzania for many reasons One is the scarcity of land If the high potential areas have been taken over by the cultivators then the system is ready to sustain itself so there are returns on RRRon labour alone Again there has been the decline of livestock for many reasons One is of course the shifting of pastures but another is that through government switching from being a provider to a facilitator in the past all the dips and all the IIIlivest agricultural no no the animal health facilities were given for free and suddenly during the crisis the government is unable to provide these services so suddenly the services are not available and then there have been so many debts from this switch from providing to facilitating People are required now to buy sites and borrow other services Some can some cannot and those who can they RRRthey avoid it They have been used to getting it for free They are not yet doing that So people lost livestock and this process we have uh documented that information We find that people gradually are becoming more dependent on agricultural foods Whereas in the sixties the people from Ngorongo were dependent on agricultural foods for only twenty per cent of their food intake uh in IIImid-eight RRRin mid-eighties they were dependent on agricultural foods for fifty-three per cent of their food intake so they need nutritional value The way they can combine their foods has been getting you know poorer and poorer uh but another thing is that in the seventies Mr Chairman one head of cattle could purchase could be <O/> for eight bags of maize but today you uh one RRRone bag of three bags of maize can RRRcan be bought by a head of cattle one big head of cattle so the terms of trade have been working against pastoralism against animal production so whereas they could barter more they could barter for more bags of maize or other forms of grain by less heads of cattle they are paying less for more heads of cattle to barter and get maize so there's been some economic motivation that if you can grow the food yourself then you save your RRRyour herd from deflation but on the other hand is there is this RRRthis feeling that uh for RRRfor decades the people have been bombarded by the ideological bullets of the nation state Of course we bureaucrats have been going around telling people you must become IIIagricult agriculturalists you must grow food crops you must grow cash crops and this over a few decades seems to be catching up with the pastoralists and uh in uh all this the Barbaig who were pastoral a few decades ago they are now agro-pastoral You have other people The Massai themselves now are becoming pastoral So the trend is moving on There are those people who are not cattlemen for example but they have taken to agriculture for the cash for a different motive Rather than deflate your <O/> for food you grow that food but then by selling the surplus which you may have acquired from RRRfrom the produce you can buy more <O/> of cattle and do more things with in this way So there are people who are BBBwho areRRR pastoral BBBwho are pastoralRRR but now aren't pastoral not because they are BBBthey areRRR losing cattle or they are unable to feed themselves sufficiently but because there is this amount So the ideology of the state has been catching up with these people but what does this mean in terms of pastoralism in this new trend It means all the high potential areas that were vital for agro-pastoral for pastoralism because you needed the territory where you can get water salt lakes you can have pastures you can BBByou canRRR uh all the other things that you need but now the high potential areas are being taken over by individuals from the <O/> because in this system everything that has been put under agriculture becomes kind of <O/> individualized by the individual cultivator but <O_><O/> place as long as it's out there people will be will have access to it It belongs to them all But once you <O/> you RRRyou take it over and there is this process now that the high potential areas are being taken over now by the outsiders cultivators agro-pastoralists but also pastoralists themselves the Massai are having cultivation so they are also transforming their own resources in that pattern that which RRRwhich used to transform and contain these processes uh To go quickly through these things what RRRwhat I what we have now is you have agro-pastoralism in the former pastoral areas You have agro-pastoralists moving on their way into the new areas so this landscape having changed what is RRRwhat is what does it mean what are the implications More so in terms of policy More so in terms of history-making When we were studying an area say Massai land you are looking at the problems of that particular area sometimes an exclusion of all the other problems around When we are dealing with pastoralism you are looking at the pastoralists their problems their concerns to the exclusion sometimes of all the other <O/> systems Now when you look at this entire trend which is <O_><O/> that uh RRRthat there are changing structures all over the country we have talked about the legal structures the economic structures the political structures you know the <O/> system has changed What are the implications Let me start with RRRwith a few The exportation of the pastoralism into areas where it never existed as in the case of the <name/> of Morogoro region There are some plains of <name/> region has increased pressure on the natural resources in the areas due to the increasing demand for fuel wood and drilling poles has subjected forests to greater pressure Wood is obtained from harvest It's obtained from natural forests which take many years to grow <O_><O/> Moreover land has been cleared by the agro-pastoralists who migrate to give way who migrate into new areas <O/> to prepare their own farms because they are rearing livestock <O_><O/> so they are clearing forests and bushes to create new farms in areas where the land was still intact What is more worrying is that these people are moving with their cultural techniques which will not be suitable to the new areas especially the arid and semi-arid areas uh Then in some places they are ploughing by oxen or cows or tractors because the RRRthe Sukuma are known to be very very very skilled farmers with cotton growing and so on Some of them have moved some of their capital into the new areas where they're ploughing the new areas to create farms and at the same time keep livestock

When people finally said no to the IIIdict IIIdic BBBto theRRR dictatorship of their leader the results become riveting Walls crashed Governments crumbled and some of those leaders who were lucky enough to survive are being called upon to account It is important to underline this fact <ea/>Ndugu Principal for far too often the point has been made that the changes there that is in Eastern Europe meant the rejection of socialism by the people that changes in Eastern Europe showed the triumph of capitalism over socialism Nothing in my view could be further more uncertain The people of Eastern Europe asked for greater freedom It would be foolish to conclude that the rejection of socialism and communist parties and their governments in Eastern Europe was also the rejection of socialism and the embracing of capitalism The lessons of Eastern Europe were important to both party and government But there are internal roots to our debate for ours is a dynamic party and therefore given to periodic review of its organisation and performance The difficult economic times and the political and social ills that they were clearly giving rise to made it certain that we would ask ourselves pertinent questions Is our system more open more accessible and effectively reaching out Are our democratic institutions more democratic today Are we positioned within the party and the government to deliver the goods aspired  for> by the people These are not new questions to CCM and the government Self-re-examination and appraisal have been a permanent feature of our evolutionary process We certainly are more democratic day than we have ever been We are amenable to advice from our people We listen to sift and weigh heavily suggestions for change Views so received either directly from the people or through their representatives will be accommodated through the democratic process And since social growth is a dynamic process we will keep on changing with time That is the crux of President Mwinyi's message to Tanzanians last Monday that in implementing the policy of socialism and self-reliance a goal we set ourselves twenty-four years ago we will move with time making changes as appropriate In this respect the democracy debate is important to us to the extent that it provides us another rich source of receiving views from a wider public we commend it BBBwe commendRRR and value it highly That people are exercising their democratic right without fear of victimisation whatsoever is a clear demonstration that democratic practice in Tanzania has matured and come of age Having said all this what then is the role of the media in this debate The traditional role of the media of reproducing and reporting views and events will still remain That requires no elaboration But in this debate the media will be additionally expected to promote the debate thus providing useful fora for the airing and presentation of views The commissioners will certainly also be greatly assisted by what the media will be carrying However I must warn against exercising I must warn the media that is against exercising undue influence on the debate I use the phrase undue influence deliberately The media cannot possibly distance themselves from the debate The selection one makes of participants in a radio discussion for example is itself a form of influence Similarly the selection of letters on the debate which will appear in the readers' columns of newspapers is a form of influence In both cases some views are read others are not Some views are heard others are not That is what the process of selection is about and that is where the influence flows In these circumstances what I am calling upon the media to do is to ensure that all sides of the debate are heard and that contributors be presented in the full vigour of their eloquence You would be doing a disservice to the debate if for example you published or aired the most illiterate and incoherent advocacy of one side or another in the debate Additionally however the media must moderate the language of the debate In this charge of the responsibility to direct the debate which the media inherently has presentations should be encouraged to address issues and not personalities On the record so far it seems to me there has been a visible tendency for contributors to go for the person rather than the argument for abuse rather than ratiocination It is important to remember that we are not embarked upon a public contestation of patriotism We should be engaged rather in a comprehensive reasoned analysis of the political economic social and constitutional circumstances now obtaining in our country the problems they give rise to and the kinds of institutional and behavioural arrangements that can improve performance in all these areas while strengthening the unity and stability of the country Personal abuse and a foul tongue do not conduce to such an outcome and the media must not be seen to be promoting them <ea/>Ndugu Principal the power of the pen and the microphone should be used in this debate demonstrably fairly and clearly The language should be concise unambiguous and presentable devoid of libellous imputation of motives The debate will be healthier if we participants exercise great restraint and arguments follow a logical pattern without rancour and insinuations The importance of having an unfettered truly free debate cannot be overstated To this end I have special appeal  on><+_to> the official media The official media's editorial comments tend to be seen by the average person to reflect official view in every respect and on every occasion Now you and I know that that cannot be the case The Monday morning editorial comment for instance on the latest league match brawl on the pitch on Saturday will not necessarily be the official view of the event Indeed there may in fact be no official view on it at all but as I say many will think that there is an official view if they read the editorial comment and that the editorial reflects that official view For this reason I urge that in the process and underline the word process in the process of the debate I urge the official media to exercise great care and circumspection in editorialising on the substance of the debate I want to repeat that I urge that in the process of the debate the official media exercise great care and circumspection in editorialising on the substance of the debate I stress the word substance for the manner in which the debate is conducted is clearly a subject of fair comment But pronouncing on the substance puts you in danger of putting pressure on the commission and <ea/>wananchi straight-jacketing the debate and predetermining its outcome That of course runs counter to the aspirations of the party the government and the people To the print media I commend the trite and true observation that a newspaper should be the maximum of information and the minimum of comment certainly on this subject Ladies and gentlemen we have over the years built up a tradition in this country of democracy and making decisions through popular participation and national consensus We will want to uphold that enviable record It is a record indeed that has been one of the secrets behind our national stability It is the foundation upon which we can confidently negotiate a prosperous entry into the new millennium I now have a great pleasure to declare this encounter open Thank you very much

In my view I think the Minister's statement or speech has been it's all embracing He has I think he has left no stone unturned on attitudes on uh behaviour on reactions and on the party philosophy and intentions on this national issue But he has underlined certain areas which are a primary interest calling for reaction  for><+_from> journalists in terms of their behaviour their role in this particular sensitive historical and I must say very important debate in the history of our nation Well the whole world is said to be on the verge of a BBBof aRRR new new venture which has been precipitated by the changes in Europe Older military alliances are now becoming allies But whereas in the past they were enemies now they have to be they are becoming allies and they have to work together towards new goals and uh if these superpowers if these uh great industrial affluent nations of the world be coming together what will be the impact of all that  to><+_on> developing countries or  to><+_on> Tanzania in particular So in order to RRRto be fair and I think to be to have an intelligent approach to this whole issue of political discussion and political uh impending political change in Tanzania I think the journalist's role will only be effective if he will look at certain important parameters that would have tremendous influence on his judgement conscience therefore his choice of words therefore his selection of candidates selection of material parameters which would influence the journalist as an agent of social change which will influence him how to be effective in his particular role in this particular debate Well having said that I think the minister if I understood him  right><+_rightly> he's demanding only quality he's demanding a better quality of journalism well not only in traditional matters but more importantly in this particular phase in this particular era of our country But to be a good journalist or a bad journalist uh Internationally we are said to be to belong to a highly cultured profession I tend to agree yes because the nature of our training the sophistication of the science of communication and journalism certainly it places us all these factors place us in that unique position to be able to RRRto IIIsp to play a particular role of special significance in our societies because we have that training But surprisingly in the end equipped with professional training there are questions of etiquette there are questions of finesse You may know your content but if you don't write or broadcast with etiquette with finesse certainly it will be reflected in the end-result of your work So the journalist trained or untrained  but> he still has the individual responsibility to raise his own standard as a journalist by developing qualities which he may not necessarily uh find them in the classroom and the end product has got to reflect etiquette has got to balance to reflect a balanced view Abusive language in our copy can only be attributed to lack of etiquette because you don't have to abuse people You don't have to use abusive language intentionally or unconsciously and expect to be taken or to be understood as a fantastic journalist There is no wisdom in using harsh language So if the tools of our work  is><+_are> words we have the responsibility to choose those words which are not loaded with abuse This is what I think and this is what I believe So maybe I have discussed the qualities of a journalist his conscience and maybe his approach to these matters But in this particular discussion which will affect all Tanzanians because it is a democratic discussion and one good thing or bad thing about democracy is the fact that all those involved have the same right or rights so who should be given prominence who should be treated as second class or who can want for his opinion to be heard later In which case political questions democratic questions of this nature have got to be seen as they are but I think more importantly have got to be seen from their political perspectives Our contribution as individuals or as journalists or as those people who are placed in a position to influence to guide to balance the debate we have to take into account certain factors which are very important  I><+_I'd> like to suggest that it is important to know historical uh the political history of Zanzibar which led to the revolution Why did people had to take up arms to kill other people What underlying factors mobilised the people to that type of action Then you will be able to appreciate certain milestones in the political processes of Zanzibar Likewise what happened in nineteen fifty-four How was TANU organised Who did it and what transpired from that time to date Is there anything to appreciate in all these processes Or is the whole process worth condemnation So in discussing issues of this nature I think we have also to take into account instead of uh BBBinstead ofRRR just jumping or looking at the political discussions and political changes  for> the journalist placed as he is I think he should have a much wider perspective much depth in the issues to be able to appreciate uh uh contributions of other people to be able to frame his questions and to be able to uh play an effective role in this crucial and historical debate Ladies and gentlemen having said that uh Mr Chairman I thank you very much

<$A> Honourable Ben Mkapa Minister of Higher Education Science and Technology Section Chairman Honourable Professor Sarungi Minister of Transport and Communications Honourable Dr Kiwanuka Regional Commissioner of Arusha region Your Excellencies the ambassadors representatives of donor agencies Principal Secretaries invited guests ladies and gentlemen Mr Chairman on behalf of the Minister of Works and on my own behalf I'd like to welcome Honourable Benjamin Mkapa Minister for Higher Education Science and Technology on behalf of the Prime Minister and First Vice-President who has kindly accepted our invitation to come and officially open our donors' conference today We the Minister of Works consider it a great honour to involve him  on><+_in> this very important conference His commitment to the development of the country's roads and transport in general makes it next to impossible not to involve him in conferences like this one today Honourable Malecela has demonstrated his involvement to the sector by participating many times in inspecting the progress of physical roadworks like the Kibiti - Lindi Tunduma - Sumbawanga Dar es Salaam city roads and many others  For> those who were here in March nineteen ninety-one may recall that Honourable Malecela was the guest of honour at the launching ceremony of the Roads Integrated Project Phase One And when invited and when we invited him again to open this conference he accepted it without any hesitation But due to some unavoidable reasons Honourable Malecela had to leave for another very important meeting in Japan He has instead sent to us Honourable Mkapa Minister for Higher Education Science and Technology to open this very important meeting on his behalf I hope you'll agree with me Mr Chairman that we should consider ourselves greatly honoured by his response to our invitation Honourable Minister Mkapa before you are distinguished guests from embassies based in Tanzania representatives from donor agencies principal secretaries uh Minister for Communication Transport Regional Development Directors Heads of Department sections from my ministry headquarters and we have here all regional engineers from Tanzania mainland We wish to thank them for having accepted our invitation to this very important conference which will run for two consecutive days beginning today the fourth of October Our main expectation  on><+_from> this conference is for the delegates to review the objectives of RIP Two its scope and its funding requirements After this donors will be asked to comment and express their interests on individual pro-project components Mr Chairman I hope you remember that a similar representation participated  on><+_in> the first donors' conference of the transport sector held also in Arusha some time in December nineteen eighty-seven for the same objective though for RIP One It is quite a consolation to say that the outcome after that donors' conference in nineteen eighty-seven and other subsequent conferences in terms of physical achievement on road network is quite remarkable Let me take this opportunity Mr Chairman to just mention a few completed road projects since we began implementation of RIP One Among the bitumen roadworks completed todate are Morogoro - Mikumi which is seventy-three kilometres Igawa - Igurusi which is fifty-nine fifty-eight kilometres Chalinze - Segera which is one seventy-four kilometres Same - Himo eighty-two kilometres Bukumbi - Isaka one fourteen kilometres and among bitumen roads under construction and rehabilitation are the Dar es Salaam - Chalinze hundred kilometres Mikumi - Kitonga forty-nine kilometres Igurusi - Songwe ninety-one kilometres Segera - Tanga seventy-one kilometres Kibiti - Ikwiriri twenty-nine kilometres Kwabero - Nyakasanza fifty-nine kilometres Musoma - Sirari ninety-two kilometres As for the gravel roads' construction and rehabilitation for the trunk and rural roads there is also good progress I hope every one of us has already seen this with his or her own eyes It is through these positive results Mr Chairman that this donors' conference was planned so that pockets which could not be filled under RIP one be considered now for RIP Two Other road sections such as Tanga - Horohoro Marangu - Tarachea etcetera have been tendered and are now in the negotiation stage while the UUUextreme and design work in fund mobilization is still going on for such roads as Dodoma - Singida Mikumi - Ifakara Mtukula - Msaunga to mention just a few of them Of course we have the Mwanza - Shinyanga border road tender already floated and opening is on the twenty-ninth October this year This is beside many regional roads which have already been tendered for RRRfor bidding The third major component Mr Chairman for RIP involves studies ranging from feasibility studies and bridge designs to office management Eighteen different studies have been carried out and these are at different stages of completion Honourable chief guest and distinguished participants it will be appreciated that RIP BBBit will be appreciated that RIPRRR is a large and complex project which needs close co-ordination I'm glad to report that there's been very good co-operation and co-ordination not only at the project execution level but also at the donors' and at the inter-ministerial levels The ministry has also organised internal workshops every year to discuss implementation bottlenecks and chart out solutions The last such workshop was held only last week in IIIthe these same premises we are in today May I therefore take this opportunity Mr Chairman to thank all those who have worked tirelessly to ensure the success of the first RIP It is their efforts which have enabled us to embark on this second phase of the project To a large extent Mr Chairman our RRRour success is also attributed to the reforms which you've undertaken since the commencement of the project Much has been done to streamline the organisation at the ministry's headquarters and at the regions' levels also The regional engineers have also been delegated greater responsibilities in execution of roadworks These reforms are still going on and very soon we shall take another step forward through the appointment of a central road board which will have a strong representation of the road users The intention is to make the organisation more responsive to the needs of the road user If I can just mention that up to now <idiom> we have started regional road boards under the chairmanship of the regional commissioners in every region and the members of these regional road boards are government leaders at different levels and their responsibilities are to advise the Minister of Works on the rehabilitation uh repair work and other uh jobs concerning our roads At the same time I wish to call upon all those who did not live up to our expectations to pull up their socks Indeed we cannot condone such people for too long because this will jeopardise the success of the project So far we have tried to tolerate them to some extent because one of the objectives of the project is to develop local expertise However there is a limit to which we can continue to tolerate them especially when the source of their their non-performance is negligence or sheer incompetence Mr Chairman it is now my intention it is not my intention to turn this address into another long speech so could you please allow me to welcome Honourable Benjamin Mkapa Minister of Higher Education Science and Technology on behalf of the Prime Minister and First Vice-President of the United Republic of Tanzania to deliver his long awaited opening address to this conference Honourable Minister <ea/>karibu

Mr Chairman Honourable Kiula Minister of Works Honourable Professor Sarungi Minister of Communications and Transport Dr Kiwanuka who is now Regional Commissioner for Arusha Representatives of donor countries and donor agencies Principal Secretaries and RDD's invited guests ladies and gentlemen as Minister Kiula has pointed out I have been given the honour of uh reading the remarks that the Prime Minister and First Vice-President would have given had he been here to open this meeting It is needless to say a special honour for me and I want to take this opportunity to thank the Prime Minister for this graciousness on his part I also want to thank Minister Kiula and Minister Sarungi for the courtesies and the regional commissioner for the courtesies which they have extended to me in order to facilitate my discharging this responsibility this morning The Prime Minister and First Vice-President's remarks to you this morning are as follows 
Your Excellencies Honourable Ministers representatives of donor agencies Principal Secretaries distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen first let me sincerely express my gratitude and delight for this privilege and honour accorded to me to speak to you this morning This assembly brings together heads and members of the diplomatic corps heads of donor agencies honourable ministers principal secretaries and other senior government officials On behalf of the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania I wish to welcome you all I wish to extend special welcome to those of you who have had to travel long distances to be with us here in Arusha and to this important donors' conference We appreciate very much your support in an efforts to improve the transport sector as part and parcel of the National Economic Recovery Programme Your Excellencies and distinguished guests let me start by giving you a little history of why we are here today Tanzania like many developing countries has had quite ambitious development programmes Right after independence we started to chart out long-term development strategies First we had three-year development programmes followed by five-year development programmes In all these programmes transport and particularly road development featured very highly Several new roads were built to a bitumen standard These included the Tanzam highway nine hundred and fifty kilometres and the Chalinze - Segera and the Mkumbara - Kisangiro roads three hundred kilometres Mtwara - Masasi two hundred kilometres which were built between nineteen sixty-eight and nineteen seventy-five Thousands of kilometres of gravel roads were also constructed Throughout these plans our emphasis was on development which was synonymous with new construction Little attention was given to preservation and maintenance of the transport infrastructure Efforts by the government to try and address the problem of road maintenance started in the late nineteen seventies with trunk road maintenance projects which were supported by the World Bank These however turned out to be half measures and did not succeed to arrest the fast deterioration of the road network Your Excellencies and distinguished guests by the mid nineteen eighties it had become evident that the deterioration of the transport infrastructure was cause for alarm The manifestations can be summarised as follows
A The condition of most rural roads was poor and transport to villages restricted to dry seasons
B The trunk road network had deteriorated to such an extent that only about forty per cent of the trunk road network was in good condition severely increasing the cost of transport and curtailing the movement of goods
C The trucking sub-sector which accounts for over seventy per cent of agricultural produce haulage from rural areas had been allowed to deteriorate due to lack of foreign exchange to replace the aged fleet as well as to maintain the fleet in IIIrutti RRRin running condition with spare parts and tyres 
E Inadequate trucking capacity coupled with low operational efficiency of parastatal trucking fleet had prevented the trucking sub-sector from coping with the surge in agricultural production following implementation of the Economic Recovery Programme
F The two railways which are strategically located to carry majority of long distance domestic and transit traffic were able to carry home only fifteen per cent of the total goods movement in the country and 
H Due to deteriorated berth and equipment the ports were unable to adequately accommodate the import and export traffic of the country nor compete effectively against other regional ports for transit traffic of neighbouring land-locked countries As a consequence of this pathetic state of the transportation infrastructure and the resultant unsatisfactory operational efficiency progress on the government's Economic Recovery Programme was stalled It was against this background that the government convened the transport sector donors' conference in December nineteen eighty-seven here in Arusha At that conference documents entitled Programme for Transport Sector Recovery outlined the basic policy institutional changes and rehabilitation requirements of the economy Also a draft national transport policy was presented to the donors Your Excellencies and distinguished guests the nineteen eighty-seven Arusha strategy for the transport sector entailed the following
A Systematic efforts to be made to improve the operational efficiency of the sector
B Financial performance and cost recovery to be improved throughout the transport sector
C Increasing resource allocation to the transport sector particularly for roads
D Improving the utilisation of existing asserts through improving the management and operations
E Concentrating future efforts on rehabilitation and maintenance of the basic road network
F Adjusting institutional structures consistent with effectively carrying out the required rehabilitation maintenance and operations
G Top priority to be given to maintenance funds' allocation for roads which had fallen far short of requirement in the past and
H To secure the maximum possible foreign exchange allocation for road maintenance as well for current operational requirements of trucking railways and aviation sub-sectors
Looking at the individual sectors and sub-sectors The railway subsector At a separate donors' conference in February nineteen eighty-seven the government and TRC adopted the Emergency Recovery Programme aimed at rehabilitating and strengthening the operations and management system for Tanzania Railways Corporation Under the programme it was agreed to concentrate all investments in the rehabilitation of key assets and to improve operating capacity through managerial improvements under a ten point programme TAZARA since nineteen eighty-four has been implementing a ten-year development plan with donor support for twenty-three project items to bring up its operations near to the effective installed capacity The port subsector Your Excellencies and distinguished guests the strategy for the port subsector was to continue with the modernisation of the Port of Dar es Salaam which had started in nineteen eighty-five and included the rehabilitation of the berths and cargo handling equipment coupled with training and technical assistance to improve efficiency in cargo handling for both container and general cargo As for the IIIavie aviation subsector the government economic recovery strategy in the civil aviation sub-sector included measures intended to improve the condition in the IIIsubjec in the subsector as follows
A Carrying out a study to rationalise Air Tanzania Corporation's overhead and support structure to improve its productivity including possible need of technical assistance
B Formulating a staged programme to increase fares for domestic market to ensure full cost recovery in the provision of services by ATC and introduce a more flexible mechanism to enable fair adjustment on a timely basis
C Limiting capital investment by ATC until such time as a rational development and financial strategy could be developed
D Pursuing an open-sky policy allowing local charter airlines to provide domestic scheduled services to meet the demand for air transport
E To improve and rehabilitate aerodromes within the framework of recommendations of a development study to be undertaken
The road transport subsector Your Excellencies and distinguished guests the strategy for the trucking subsector focused on the importation of requirements including an accelerated replacement programme for aged trucks and continued support for importing spare parts fuel and raw materials for tyre production to alleviate rural transport andmarketing of agricultural commodities In the short term the government agreed to allow market forces to determine the appropriate level of interregional trucking tariffs with a view to allowing the operators to recover their operating costs and to realise a reasonable return on their assets And in the long term to review the role and function of RETCOs and other state-owned transport agencies The roads' subsector The roads' subsector strategy comprises a comprehensive approach which entailed integrating the implementation of key road investments with major policy and institutional reforms such as
A Rehabilitating and improving the priority trunk and rural roads essential for evacuation of agricultural products
B Strengthening the administration and management of trunk and regional roads in order to maintain the rehabilitated roads network in satisfactory condition
C Enhancing road maintenance capacity in the country through promotion and use of local contractors
D Improving the availability of road maintenance equipment through encouraging the establishment of commercially operated plant pools

Achievements of the strategies under the programme for transport sector recovery Your Excellencies and distinguished guests I'm glad to report that since nineteen eighty-seven the government has taken a number of key policy and institutional actions that are needed to attain the physical targets spelt out in the transport sector recovery strategy In particular in the railway subsector under a memorandum of understanding between TRC and the Government TRC has been allowed to operate on commercial basis thereby setting salaries and taking other decisions without reference to government It is heartening to note that sincefiscal year nineteen ninety-one TRC has been making an operating profit With regard to the port subsector in order to recover the investment under the port modernisation project and to cope with the fall in the value of the shilling the government has allowed THA to increase tariffs which had not been changed since nineteen eighty-four Furthermore measures to commercialise THA are under way and towards this end the Dar es Salaam port development master plan study and the IIIcommer RRRthe commercialisation study are planned Turning to the aviation subsector in March nineteen ninety-two the government made several important and bold decisions on the future of ATC as follows
One ATC shall continue to exist but shall operate on a commercial basis generating a profit
Two Government will absorb a large part of AT's debt in order to make corporations' balance sheet attractive to private investors
Three Allowing ATC to sell some of its IIIass assets generating funds to pay off creditors and to improve its working capital position 
And Four Giving ATC the autonomy to IIIto set tariffs and the mandate to gradually withdraw its services from the loss-making roots The civil aviation board has implemented the open-sky policy by granting operating licences to other operators to compete with ATC And government has commissioned a study to look into the restructuring of the directorate of civil aviation and the creation of a national airports authority to manage operate and maintain the major airports However government will continue to provide for the uneconomical airports especially in the remote areas With regard to the road transport subsector the availability of vehicles transport inputs and spares has been greatly enhanced through the liberalisation of imports of vehicles and spare parts using own or the open general licence funds as well as direct support by donors and grants from friendly countries And the government has endeavoured to improve passenger and goods transport operations in rural areas by exempting all vehicles of carrying capacity of over three tons and buses of twenty-five passengers capacity from import duty and sales tax Furthermore the government has allowed UDA and the private operators to earn a reasonable return on their investments Turning to the road sub-sector investment priorities have been re-oriented to road rehabilitation and maintenance Furthermore and this is very important the budget re-allocations for road maintenance are being increased annually For instance government funds for annual routine and periodic road maintenance have increased by two hundred and fifty per cent from about IIIU United States dollars four point nine million in fiscal year nineteen eighty-seven eighty-eight to US dollars seventeen million in fiscal year nineteen ninety-two ninety-three Since nineteen ninety-one ninety-two fiscal year revenue for road maintenance is being collected mainly from road users through the imposition of a levy on fuel consumption which is deposited into a designated roads' fund In Ministry of Works the institutional framework for planning managing and maintaining the roads networks has been restructured through the following measures
One The creation of the division for roads and aerodromes
Two The decentralisation of authority for implementing road maintenance and works to the twenty regional engineers offices
Three Under IRP various donors are funding technical assistance teams in eleven regions to strengthen the execution capacity for maintaining the roads by the Regional Engineers' offices
Four Under the IRP umbrella donors are supporting well-defined programmes at the University of Dar es Salaam Engineering Faculty Technical Colleges of Dar es Salaam and Arusha Ministry of Works' Training Institute at Morogoro and at the National Institute of Transport Execution capacity for maintaining the road network is being improved through the REO's by gradually increasing the contracting out of road maintenance works Also under UNDP ILO support a programme to train local contractors in rural road rehabilitation and maintenance using labour-based methods started in Kilimanjaro region in nineteen ninety-two and the programme will be extended to other regions soon And Ministry of Works roads building equipment has been transferred to a plant and equipment hire company which started hiring to REO's and contractors at commercial rates with effect from July nineteen ninety-two What has been the impact of the programme for the transport sector recovery Your Excellencies and distinguished guests much progress has been made in the last six years of the implementation of the programme for the transport sector recovery Assessment of the impact of the programme on the economy shows that mobility has increased dramatically where road conditions have improved and that crops cereals and fresh fruits and vegetables are now moving more easily from the farms to the processing and storage centres and to the markets In specific terms the impact can be said to be as follows Within the railways the haulage of transit traffic which earns foreign exchange for the country has improved more than a hundred per cent since fiscal year nineteen ninety-one Also there are significant improvements on the movement of export commodities such as coffee With regard to the ports the average ship stay time in port has gone down to three days as opposed to eight days before the implementation of the port modernisation project The overall productivity of the port has improved appreciably The average gang output for general cargo is now two hundred and fifty tons per shift compared to about a hundred tons in the mid nineteen eighties The average container dwell time has reduced from about fifty days to an average of only about thirteen days In a nutshell the improved productivity of the port which led to savings in transit costs has made the Dar es Salaam port much more competitive with other regional ports With regard to the roads and road transports improved road conditions have led to shorter travel times This has been most significant along the Tanzam highway between Dar es Salaam and Zambia and along the Northern route to Kenya through Chalinze Segera Moshi and Arusha including the branch to Tanga In fact the travel time between Dar es Salaam and Arusha six hundred and fifty kilometres is now less than nine hours compared to fourteen hours before implementation of the IRP Additionally buses are now travelling regularly to many regional and district centres which were isolated before road works and maintenance started under IRP Also traffic volumes have generally doubled on those forecast in the feasibility studies for sections that have undergone rehabilitation under IRP which shows the impact of good roads on personal mobility and freight movement

Increased human activities have become a threat to these sanctuary areas Tourism and construction activities are increasingly threatening the conservation of the coastal areas causing large scale sea erosion problems and coastal pollution The Mozambican coast is rich in minerals like titanium and rare earth minerals natural gas and other minerals Prospects for increasing mining are high therefore if care is not taken earlier these areas will in the near future become a cause of concern in environmental terms Overpopulation growing cities overspills and pollution are some of the best challenges to management efforts of our coast As in case of Mozambique over ninety per cent of our industries are concentrated along the coastal cities Present oil disaster with the Greek tanker Katina P that sank off the RRRthe coast of Mozambique after polluting large areas of southern Mozambique is an issue of concern for the countries like ours which have no means of their own to manage these type of human made uh disasters Mr Chairman what I've pointed above is just an attempt to show that coastal zones are very important or maybe the most important of all  habitat><+_habitats> on the planet earth The backbone of our economy as is  in> case of Mozambique is based on rational RRRrational exploration of our coastal resources It is a matter of necessity to have this precious blessing of nature protected and managed carefully for our own and future generations' survival Any development activity should integrate coastal zones and its peculiarities taken into consideration For coastal areas sustainable development should mean I believe an integrated national planning where every element of economic and social coastal programme is integrated  to><+_into> other national programmes with the main objective in mind of correct management practices and sustainable development However our concern should not be limited to integrated management It should equally ensure that this management is sustainable and economically sound Equally rapid recovery programmes for damaged coastal environment should get all the necessary attention and necessary financial support as we know a long time neglected environment is hard to recover at a lower cost Mozambique had during the last decade given special attention to coastal management of the country despite financial constraints that the country faces With some international support a number of projects have been developed and implemented with varying degree of success These projects include an integrated development project of Inyaka Island off Maputo where marine forest and population resettlement programmes have been carried out This project has been supported by the United Nations Development Programme UNDP An integrated coastal zone development project of Makufi BBBof MakufiRRR in the northern province of Cape Delgado has also been put into practice with IIIfin financial support of NORAD A similar project is being developed for the Nakala - Musurili coastal zone also in Northern Mozambique awaiting to get < funding at this stage Equally a national environmental management programme which we call NEMP is at present being prepared It will consist of an environmental policy and environmental registration and a programme of principal activities that is sectorial and thematic plans of action The final product aimed is a policy document In the course of preparation of this document training public awareness building intersectoral sectorial harmonisation of plans and community participation  is><+_are> part of the process One of the major components of this programme is the preparation of the integrated coastal zone management plan We have so far approached IUCN for guidance using their experience in this field Not only such a plan will assist us in the co-ordination of institutional responsibilities in the coastal areas but also it will be an occasion for closer approximation with local amenities and interest groups It will also be an occasion to test our models of community management of natural resources Lack of financial resources is the major constraint in this process which we consider important for Mozambique However we are encouraged with the experience of the Seychelles which has successfully accomplished a similar process Their experience will be important for other countries of the region including my country And I've been very much pleased to understand that other countries have accomplished the same programme In regional terms Mozambique has been active in promoting regional co-operation on environmental managemental matters As President of the <name> commission on lake and river bases and a member of <name> bureau our membership earmarked bureau and our signature to the bio-diversity and climate change conventions last year in Rio de Janeiro are but a few contributions that Mozambique has made to regional and international efforts on environment and we shall continue to do our duties Mr Chairman I hope that Mozambique's coastal problems are not unique to the region Our problems are probably larger due to our relatively long coast line as my colleague from Madagascar has just pointed thus demanding from us heavier financial resources and more trained people Mozambique feels that regional co-operation should be a key to our programmes Co-ordinated research activities on fauna flora sea erosion patterns pollution and overall planning should be co-ordinated and disseminated so as to rationalise resources We feel that scientists should work with the governments also in order to commit them to environmental priority programmes and awareness The strengthening of existing research institutions where they do exist and opening them for regional co-operation and exchange could in no doubt rationalise our small resources A regional data bank on sea management for the countries of the region could be of great importance Donor countries and Unep could play an important role in this gigantic effort We countries of the region should be capable to monitor and manage the environment BBBthe environmentRRR correctly and efficiently in the shortest possible period Equally important is the institutional building and strengthening This will help to manage and implement policies and national laws effectively Integrating the policies and laws into economic development programmes will require strong institutions The Mozambican constitution has integrated in its nineteen ninety constitution a number of important articles defining the environment and its role  to><+_in> the development and as well and well-being of its people Mr Chairman let me take this opportunity to thank you and the Government of the Republic of Tanzania for the warm and brotherly hospitality given to us Kindly convey  gratitudes><+_gratitude> and thanks to your government and people Many thanks to the Swedish Government and the Swedish agency for research and co-operation for support given to the environmental programmes in our region including my country I hope they will continue enriching our programmes To FAO IOC SIDA and UNEP our whole and total recognition for their constant support to our governments for environmental programmes so important to the overall economy and social development of our region Many thanks for your attention Thank you very much

<$B> Thank you very much honourable Minister from Mozambique for your presentation I'm sure again my fellow honourable Ministers will agree with me that we're very much moved  on><+_by> your dedicated commitment on conservation measures especially since uh RRRsince uh that you have said that uh Mozambican coast line is having abundant mineral resources and that the growing population along the coastal belt of Mozambique is carrying  up><+_on> immense RRRimmense RRRimmense activities which can hamper uh marine aqua-systems and RRRand RRRand coastal environments So we're very much moved  with><+_by>our experience Well I RRRnow call upon Honourable Minister Mrs Diesen Jorreh Minister for the Environment Economic Planning and External relations of the Republic of Seychelles Honourable Minister will you please take the place of honour
<$A> Mr Chairman ministers distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen it is somewhat most formidable task to take the floor when one is at the end of the list However I hope that you will bear with me for a few minutes I am most pleased and honoured to participate as a member of the East African group uh and also as a member of the Indian Ocean States community in this conference I am hopeful that together we shall be able to come up with some innovative decisions for the region which will contribute towards the achievement of the <name/> division for the people of the earth This policy conference on integrated coastal zone management in the East African region is long overdue I must congratulate the Government of Tanzania and SAREC the organisers for taking the initiatives in ensuring that policy makers are given the opportunity to discuss the issues relating to coastal zone management and the sustainability of their coastal zones within a regional frame work The ocean has always been at the centre of our pre-occupations It provides us with food and leisure It influences our climate and it is the basis of our livelihood especially for those of us who rely on tourism fisheries and maritime trade In so far as Seychelles is concerned the republic comprises of more than a hundred islands with a land area of only four hundred and fifty square kilometres Just our exclusive economic zone extends over one point two million square kilometres as much as the land area of Tanzania for instance Our population is jut over seventy thousand Tourism accounts for fifteen per cent of the country's GNP Tourism activities forty-five per cent fisheries for twelve per cent and fisheries related activities for two per cent Thus Seychelles depends on its renewable IIIresour natural resources for at least seventy-four per cent of its GNP In this respect all development has been geared to take advantage of the economic opportunities afforded by our coastal and ocean environments Ninety per cent of our population and infrastructure are located on the narrow strip of the coast line on one island The competition for space along the coast will become more pronounced in the years to come The growth of industries may compound the existing problems of waste treatment and disposal The ecological and aesthetic functions of coastal and marine habitats may be affected drastically since the Seychelles Islands' ecosystems contain a very high percentage of endemic species of plants and animals found nowhere else in the world The government of Seychelles is aware of these problems It has always recognised the challenge of development that is family based on the twin principles of sustainability of natural resources and the integrity of the coastal ocean environment We feel therefore that the marine environment must be given the attention it deserves and that the use and development of the world's coastal resources must be governed by a coherent global policy This principle was endorsed at Rio Earth Summit last November IIILas sorry RRRLast November the Seychelles Government together with the Swedish agencies of Stockholm Environment Institute and SAREC organised the first column for East and South African countries on sustainable development The Seychelles government is fully committed to this vision of a holistic development of the world's coastal zones and oceans The need for an integrated approach to the management and sustainable development of coastal zones including the exclusive economic zones is of critical importance In the environmental management plan for Seychelles which integrates development and environment the coastal management programme accounts for a significant proportion of the projects Implementation of the programme has started at both the national and regional levels Financing for this has been secured from the EEC and the World Bank Discussions have started with agencies like IUCN SAREC UNESCO regarding the setting up of a marine sciences IIIres research centres But to date no firm commitment has been received There have been proposals though to develop training programmes which could be partly localised or regionalized in order to make the training more relevant and cost effective As a small island state with all the inherent constraints of scarce land space limited resources dispersion and isolation lack of economies of scale the government of Seychelles would like to underline the facts that the coastal environment is of paramount importance and constitutes an IIIin RRRan invaluable development resource Island states in the Indian Ocean and Eastern African region should be accorded special recognition in the same way that the Caribbean and Pacific countries are designated as special development groupings requiring special assistance We believe therefore that there is an urgent need to strengthen and establish appropriate co-ordinating mechanisms for integrated management and sustainable development of coastal and marine areas and their resources for the region as a whole Duplication should be avoided Maximum use should be made of existing institutions and successful programmes at national regional intraregional and international levels

<$A> Honourable Horace Kolimba Member of Parliament Secretary-General <name> distinguished guests uh members of TAPO ladies and gentlemen it is indeed an honour and pleasure for me to welcome our distinguished chief guest Honourable Horace Kolimba to officiate the opening of our sixth Tanzanian Association of Parastatal Organisations Symposium Honourable chief guest the audience in front of you are essentially the chief executives of parastatal organisations in Tanzania TAPO was founded in nineteen eighty-one principally to promote co-ordinated efforts in managing our economy and to create a forum for improved communication and dialogue between the government and our parastatal organisations with an overall aim of promoting corporate excellency and effectiveness It has been customary for us to hold every year a symposium to review and exchange ideas on current issues which have particular bearing on the performance of our organisations The theme for this year's symposium is  on> commercialization of parastatals in Tanzania Recent years have seen increased interest not only  on><+_in> the performance but also  on><+_in> the justification of public enterprises in Tanzania in the wake of their discernible inability to assist in propping up our ailing economy and the recognition that they're in fact substantially accountable for the present ills of the economy Our IIIsymp symposium last year therefore focused on searching for various options and conceptual frameworks under which our troubled parastatal organisations could be restructured back into viable entities Indeed we managed to cover valuable ground in respect of gaining a deeper insight  of><+_into> the factors at the root of our problems their complexity and possible direction we ought to be moving to redress uh these particular problems Inadequate play of market forces in the operational environment of parastatal organisations in Tanzania however stood out through and through as one of the more basic and major  constraint><+_constraints> affecting performance Studies in countries grappling with a similar phenomenon have indicated that this is not a problem peculiar to Tanzania It is a typical problem and certainly the leading factor which has retarded economic growth and even brought about turmoil among centrally planned economies dominated by state-run enterprises There is now a consensus that transformation into market friendly economies with a greater dictation of market driven forces in determining their location of resources and economic activity  many><+_much> more participation in the state in business and the increasing exposure to domestic and international competition hold the key to the infusion of innovation efficiency and improved productivity among public enterprises and their economies at large In this year's symposium we have thus chosen to extend our last year's discussion on parastatal restructure by examining in greater focus the aspect of parastatal commercialization which is seen as an important vehicle towards comprehensive restructuring and one having potentially rapid dividends in rehabilitating our parastatal organisations Honourable chief guests commercialization of parastatal organisations will characteristically entail dismantling of all forms of government non-tariff protection or any preferential treatment or insulation of our parastatals against domestic and foreign competitors It will also call for significant withdrawal of government interference in the management of parastatal organisations with parallel concessions on parastatal autonomy One is happy to note that we have made some modest beginning in some of these matters albeit in patches and within a disjointed and ambivalent policy environment It is still a fact however that effective commercialization of a parastatal organisation is an important if not a necessary transient step before embarking into IIIcomprehe comprehensive restructuring which has to deal with the complex and emotive issues of closure play-offs divestiture privatization and has in any case to move cautiously and in phases Commercialization should also be able to facilitate attraction of joint-venture partners and private investors into rehabilitating our ailing parastatal organisations and even enhancing the value of their equity sale In view of the urgency to get our economic enterprises to contribute to the growth and development of our country however we have to move away now from mere conceptualization of the problem at hand into developing and urgently a concrete action programme for commercializing and restructuring our parastatal organisations We need however to have an appropriate operating framework to guide us in doing this exercise successfully A plausible framework in developing a sound action programme for restructuring public enterprises in Tanzania will have to reflect an evolutionary and a total systems approach process Five systematic stages which I consider basic in this IIIpro process are problem identification fixing desired objectives uh setting up implementation strategies identification and planning of tactics and finally diagnosis and action implementation requirements The first stage towards developing a sound commercialization or restructuring packages for IIIim imbattled parastatal organisations is to identify the specific problems and factors behind poor performance for each respective organisation This these factors will be sustained operating losses for instance or non-competitiveness in the domestic or international markets or excessive cost to the consumers etcetera etcetera Once the problems are known it will be possible then to move to the second stage which involves pinpointing objectives of the intended remedial action Some of these objectives for restructuring will be efficiency competitiveness profitability IIIelib elimination of subsidies or disengagement from excessive bank borrowing uh dependence 
The third stage comprises  of> evaluating and selecting appropriate strategies for achieving each parastatal organisation's major objective uh restructuring The fourth stage focuses on developing specific tactics needed to carry the sale of shares that equity shops sell to local or foreign IIIinvestm investors etcetera The fifth and final stage in this process is consideration of the implementation requirements Both comprehensive restructuring and prior to that commercialization of RRRof parastatal organisations in Tanzania call into play important implementation implications which will have to be addressed effectively in the interest of drawing up a viable action programme Chief among these is the need to create a central organ preferably parastatal reform commission to develop policy and to plan co-ordinate and supervise the implementation of parastatal commercialization and restructuring in Tanzania The complexity of the exercise RRRexercise imposes uh <O/> some organisational demands and nothing short of a strong and independent body capable of looking at the IIIprob problem globally IIIcomprehensive comprehensively and systematically in well-conceived phases can assure us success The introduction of  an> appropriate and adequate financial intermediaries such as merchant banks stock exchange and capital markets which take time to set up and function will have to be carefully planned and made to move harmoniously with the programmed restructuring There is also the question of ethnic balance in equity ownership which deserves due attention as well as how to promote indigenous entrepreneurs to participate fully in the uh privatised or semi-privatised uh enterprises Further down there are issues of evolving appropriate legislation and defining areas for institutional and infrastructural building by the central government in order to create an enabling environment for corporate excellence All these will require the co-ordination and direction of a UUUPAFU central organ The other critical implementation requirement in the process of commercialization and ultimate comprehensive restructuring of parastatal organisations in Tanzania is the backing of a strong political wing and unambiguous commitment  over><+_to> these measures  by><+_of> the government and the party In all fairness these elements are presently in serious > deficience><+_deficiency> although there have been some RRRsome uh IIIdis discussions in the last few uh RRRfew days An improvement in posture is extremely vital and for a start it could be reflected by the government and the party addressing more seriously the question of setting up the stock exchange market by say in Tanzania getting experienced professionals as the International Finance Company Corporation IFC to undertake a thorough study and make recommendations on needed course of action instead of the present haphazard handling of the matter Honourable chief guests these are but a few uh pertinent observations that should not be overlooked in our endeavour to IIIre restructure our parastatal organisations Much more and in  a> finer detail will be taken up in the following papers to be presented and discussed in this symposium The ideal cord of relationship between the shareholder parity ministry holding corporations and operating companies uh by the Principal Secretary <ea/>Ndugu <name> the Minister of Finance performance contracts by Professor Trivedi the World Bank Resource person commercialization the Nigerian experience by Mr Hamsa Said Evaluating of the function rules of holding companies by uh Dr Moshi from University of Dar es Salaam and uh I don't know whether <name> is here but he was supposed to speak on IIItechnical on technicalities of privatizations privatization uh negotiations and completion of contracts Honourable chief guest you'll notice that some of the presentations will be made by the World Bank Resource persons This is due to accommodating of late request to TAPO by the Presidents office and <name> to provide a forum at this symposium for the viewpoints and experiences of the World Bank on commercialization and privatization under the belief that the exposure gained could assist our chief executives in formulating more effective strategies and action programmes for IIIre restructuring our ailing public enterprises TAPO on its part welcomes any well-meant collaborative spirit and will certainly take up all valuable contributions from the World Bank insofar as they conform to our practical needs and the objective uh circumstances of our environment Honourable chief guest were all keenly aware of the special impetus that could be given to the whole process of commercialization and restructuring of our parastatal organisations if the party committed greater political will and leadership to parastatal reform Your acceptance to inaugurate this symposium today is a reflection that to a certain degree the party in general and yourself in particular have a favourable disposition to this endeavour 
<$B> to all degree
<$A> to all degree On behalf of TAPO members I thank you most sincerely for your interest with above remarks and I have the pleasure in inviting you honourable RRRhonourable chief guest to IIIaddr RRRto address this gathering and declare the nineteen ninety-one TAPO symposium open Thank you very much

Honourable C G Kahama Director of IPC distinguished leaders government officials dear guests ladies and gentlemen I'm very pleased to have been invited to open the first Investment Promotion seminar organized by the Investment Promotion Centre I would like therefore to thank the Director General and the IPC staff firstly for giving me this opportunity to participate in this seminar and secondly for making Moshi as a starting point As pointed out by Director General our region has made a significant contribution towards our national economic development We know that Investment Promotion Centre which is now two and a half years old was created by an Act of Parliament in nineteen ninety The main objectives of the IPC are to act as a focal point for the promotion co-ordination regulation and monitoring of local and foreign investments in Tanzania The Centre started functioning in September nineteen ninety when the President appointed the first Director General and it has been making  a> gradual IIIprogr progress in promoting foreign investment Although in the seminar you will be discussing the ways to promote further investment opportunities and the deployment of our own resources it is also important to focus on the historical background of our economic development We all know that after attaining independence our economic sector was  under><+_in> private hands and mostly foreigners The state therefore took control of all major means of production after the launching of Arusha Declaration in nineteen sixty-seven The economic sector which was  under><+_in> private hands was put under control of the state Our country also became a one-party state The major means of production which were nationalized after independence were as I said predominantly in foreign hands and they were geared towards the colonial interests The nationalization exercise therefore was aimed at directing the economic sector to serve the interests of the majority of Tanzanian population And this was a vital step implementing our policy of socialism and self-reliance Nationalization therefore enabled Tanzanian population to enjoy free social services Free education free medical services were provided by the state out of the nationalized economic sector Nationalization was therefore the only IIIidea ideal way to distribute equitably the national cake among the majority of the poor  Tanzania><+_Tanzanian> peasants Although the exercise was welcomed and supported by the majority of poor Tanzanians it was faced with problems After nationalization we experienced the problem of lack of expertise to manage the economic institutions Both managerial technical skills were lacking in most of the nationalized institutions Apart from this problem the sector was faced with the problem of capital investment The industries therefore produced below capacity due to lack of sufficient inputs power failure poor infrastructure mismanagement coupled with the embezzlements and sabotage This trend therefore led to the collapse of some of our parastatals Bora Shoe Company stands as a good example The economic performance under state control became worse in the late nineteen seventies because of the following factors There was severe drought which forced the government to spend the major foreign  reserve><+_reserves> to import food instead of agricultural or industrial imports The collapse of East BBBof East AfricanRRR community forced the government to re-allocate the major resources to form our own organizations airways harbours railways post and telecommunications Another factor which contributed to the worse economic performance was the war with Idi Amin of Uganda The government had to deviate our national resources from economic ventures to finance the war which although we eventually won left the country in economic pledge The control of the economy by RRRby the state therefore did not accelerate the expected economic progress The economic performance remained poor And this in turn led to the poor services service provision in the social sector Unfortunately the private sector both indigenous and foreign which could have filled the gap had been largely discouraged to operate alongside with the public sector You may here recall that the Arusha Declaration had forbidden anybody aspiring to be a leader to own any economic venture however small it could have been This concept therefore led to the potential individuals to fail to contribute to the national economic growth Agricultural sector which was the backbone of our economy did not perform well because of various factors The majority of peasants could not improve and increase their agricultural output because of the high costs of imports and falling prices of the agricultural goods in the world market The farmers became victims because they were forced to accept the low prices for their coffee cotton sisal and other agricultural products Farmers unlike the industrial producers were not able to control the prices of the agricultural goods This means therefore that even their great IIIagr agricultural sector performance was not very good for reasons explained This analysis therefore helps to explain why our economy remained  under><+_in> a crisis in the IIIla BBBin theRRR late seventies and early eighties It was during this period when the government formulated the recovery policies like the National Economic Survival Programme and later the Structural IIIAdjust Adjustment Programme Along with these programmes the government decided to liberalize trade People with foreign exchange were allowed to import goods to fill the shops which had gone empty for a considerable period IIIPeop people may recall when it was difficult to find any of essential goods  from><+_in> the shops At times people had to do without the essential goods because they could not be found in shops Actually the good intention of state control of the economy had led the government to try to do everything for the people but it ended up doing very little or nothing at all The move towards trade liberalization therefore made the private sector to IIIto start contribute towards our economic recovery The shops which RRRwhich were virtually empty in the early RRRearly nineteen eighties are now filled with various consumer and accessory goods Trade liberalization therefore became one of the major steps in our economic programme recovery programme The changes taking place now around the world have greatly influenced the changes to take place in most of the countries where state control of the economy was prevailing The socialist countries like China and Russia which had state controlled economies have greatly changed and now they have liberalized their economies China for example has changed it by creating suitable conditions for private sector to RRRto operate They have created economic zones which are provided with all necessary infrastructures to attract BBBto attractRRR foreign investors This policy therefore has attracted investors from USA Japan and the other Western countries to invest in China Tanzania likewise has also to liberalize all spheres which were controlled by the state The private sector which was ignored after independence has it now has to be encouraged and protected Our government realizes that the political economic and the social environment are characterized by RRRby dynamism They have to keep on changing to accommodate the changing environment This explains why we have moved from one-party-system to multiparty-system and from state controlled economy to privatisation and from free social services to paid service provision In this era the ruling party CCM and the government therefore have resolved to resort to the traditional roles of the government of maintaining law and order and creating conducive climate for private investments and individual initiatives to operate smoothly We have now therefore be aware that the state now will no longer be involved in the economic ventures as it used to be in the past Although Tanzania is a poor country we should be proud that we managed throughout to maintain stability peace and security The changes taking place in the country therefore require peaceful and stable environment It is the duty of the government therefore to ensure that peace security in the country  is><+_are> maintained at all costs We should learn from our brothers in Burundi Rwanda Angola Mozambique Somalia where civil wars have adversely affected their social and economic lives The instability prevailing in these countries have led to the indigenous and foreign and foreigners to flee from these countries This is indeed IIIde uh deplorable situation because most of the bloodshed taking place is caused by power struggle between personalities at the expense of the poor people We should therefore learn from these countries and assure that we do not fall into this trap Only military investors who will be willing to invest in RRRin places where there is war but IIIwho but not the economic investors May I therefore call upon all Tanzanians who love to live in peace to co-operate with the government in ensuring that they will do not put our country into strife caused by religious tribal or any other differences We have been since IIIindep since pre-independence days living like brothers and sisters irrespective of our tribal or religious differences The recent incidence of unrest caused by a group by groups of few fundamentalists under the pretext of religion should be condemned by all peace-loving Tanzanians and all foreigners who aspire to invest in Tanzania We should therefore consolidate our solidarity and co-operate together in assuring that we create an IIIatmo an atmosphere of stability and prosperity  for><+_in> the interest of all Tanzanians and for foreign investors May I also point out that although we have allowed opposition parties to be formed and operate we should join together in creating favourable conditions to attract investors during this transitional period It is therefore very sad for some of the opposition parties to advocate for the elimination of groups of people who they call BBBthey callRRR UUU<ea/>gabacholis in favour of UUU<ea/>walalahoi This is a wrong concept because it is misleading to assume that the poor Tanzanians will get rich by driving out the Indians Arabs and other foreigners living in Tanzania Let us learn from what took place in Uganda during Idi Amin's era The Indians were kicked out and the IIIindig the indigenous people were handed over their business The  Uganda><+_Ugandan> economy did not improve neither were the majority of the Ugandans became rich The new regime has realized the mistake and now they have invited the Indians back to come and participate in building the  Uganda><+_Ugandan> economy Tanzania under CCM therefore will not support the idea of eliminating the IIIforeign the foreigners in favour of indigenous Tanzanians because it means discouraging foreign investors The government under the liberalization policy will go on encouraging both local and foreign investors to participate in the economic ventures We are aware that due to economic crisis the problem of uh unemployment has grown up We have a lot of youths migrating to urban areas and due to the to unemployment problems most of them have indulged themselves in crimes as a shortcut way of earning their living The government therefore has launched a special fund about one point eight million shillings to be loaned to this group to enable them to make their own small economic projects We also hope that under investment programme some of the youths will be absorbed in the new economic projects Although the government is withdrawing from running the economic activities we hope that the private sector will fully co-operate in building our economy We invite all genuine investors to come because the prevailing situation is right for serious and genuine investors The tax invaders and dubious people who come under cover of investment policy will not be entertained The government and my ministry in particular would like to assure genuine investors that they will be fully protected if on their part there will be they will IIIobs observe laws and the regulations laid down The role of the government will largely remain of ensuring there is peace harmony and order in the country May I now take BBBMay IRRR take this opportunity to urge the IPC to ensure that our open door policy is well translated and transmitted to the willing local and foreign investors I also call upon all Tanzanians to understand this policy so that they can participate positively particularly in buying shares in the collapsing parastatals We need to understand that investment policy apart from creating employment will also offer other opportunities like transfer of technology IIIavail availability of essential consumer goods managerial skills capital formation effective infrastructure and growth of the economy in general It is the task of RRRof IPC therefore to ensure that the policy succeeds and that ultimately the Tanzanians are able to enjoy the results May I also call upon investors from the developed countries to make a deliberate move to invest IIIlarge largely in developing countries like Tanzania We have a lot of unexploited potentialities which have remained idle because of lack of capital investment The deliberate move therefore will help to break to IIIbrid RRRto bridge the widening gap between the rich and the poor nations The investment has to flow from the rich nations to the poor as a way of eliminating contradictions which may disturb  the> world peace We all love peace and prosperity therefore let us work together towards that end I hope that the participants will discuss seriously how we can promote and encourage accelerated investment in Tanzania Let me assure you that the government will be ready to support and assist the IPC endeavour We are anxiously waiting to learn the outcome of your seminar Once again I thank the Director General of IPC for inviting me to this seminar I also and also for the participants who have managed to attend and lastly for listening to me I now have much pleasure to declare this seminar open Thank you very much

Thank you chairperson Guests of honour Honourable Minister of State President's Office Civil Service <ea/>Ndugu Fatma Said Ali MP Director of Social Services Zanzibar Assistant Commissioner for Social Services Tanzania mainland Chairperson of EAFOD Secretary General of uh SAFORD Members or  Representative><+_Representatives> of United Nation Agencies Guest of Honours  Distinguished Guests Ladies and Gentlemen I think before I make the closing or concluding statement I would like first to remind ourselves  as leaders and try to see who is a leader We are all leaders and we are all seated there as leaders So probably when I describe a leader you have the freedom to accept or to reject that First I say that a leader is lazy letting others in the group do the work Two the leader is crazy believing that others will do the work Third the leader is stupid attempting impossible tasks even after the final no A leader is ignorant always a student asking stupid questions eager to learn A leader is foolish working hard dedicated receiving little material reward A leader is brazen stepping forward when others shy away putting duty before career A leader is <_/impetus> daring to question the validity of the underlying assumptions of sacred cows as their relation to the past present and future A leader is powerless playing open-handed letting others know all the information at the leader's disposal in a manner useful to others A leader is *indisciplined> and individual in the absence of orders initiates and executes the right course of action A leader is incompetent seeking help when needed no matter what light it throws on the leader's competence in getting the job done And lastly a leader is weak letting those around be individuals by allowing them to have the *attributers> of a good leader So you have the freedom to RRRto RRRto accept to reject or whatever but I feel those are the  characteristic><+_characteristics> of a leader Honourable Minister ladies and gentlemen at this concluding ceremony of a training of trainers workshop and the second regional executive committee meeting of the Eastern African Federation of the Disabled that is EAFOD it gives me great pleasure to record with much appreciation the role all the participants played to bring all the business which started on Monday twenty-fourth IIIninetee January nineteen ninety-four to such a successful conclusion The deliberations of our workshop and indeed those of the region's executive committee meeting have opened a new chapter in the development of disabled people in the whole of eastern Africa The workshop came up with very interesting and practical  resolution><+_resolutions> whose implementation by all parties concerned will definitely ensure a new life for disabled people a life which they have been denied for a long time in the region For decades eastern African countries have been undergoing all kinds of social economic political and in some cases religious problems and under such conditions and throughout these decades of turmoil disabled people have been suffering silently For those who have tried to cry out loudly their voices have not been heard by anybody Ours has been a voice in the wilderness Therefore through this EAFOD we now have a powerful and loud voice of disabled people in the part in this part of the world Through unity we are going to make that voice ever louder and stronger Our governments in the region need to receive and accept all the resolutions which were made by the workshop participants On behalf of all my colleagues in eastern Africa I would like to thank uh the government of Zanzibar and the government of Tanzania for all the support that have given us and to enable us successfully achieve the  objective><+_objectives> of this workshop I would also like to thank all the participants and the EAFOD leadership for a job well done Thanks also too for choosing Zanzibar to be the interim headquarters of the Eastern African Federation of the Disabled I would like to assure all of you that as Secretary General of EAFOD I will do my best to keep all our progresses properly co-ordinated and this of course will be done with the co-operation of all executive members of EAFOD and grass-root member organisations that belong to Eastern Africa With this short conclusive remark honourable guest of honour on behalf of EAFOD and on behalf of the participants of the workshop I would like to read to you and to all those present the resolutions that were adopted uh at the workshop These resolutions are supposed not to be uh papers to be filed in the files but these are going to be papers that have to be you know to be implemented for the benefit and development of disabled people in the region So these are the resolutions which are adopted Preamble This first Eastern African Federation of the Disabled meeting of training of trainers workshop which brought together thirty delegates from eleven EAFOD member countries to discuss and get practical solutions of acquiring knowledge and implementing such knowledge to empower and enable their constituencies in their respective countries in order for them to be able to redress all the past imbalances which societies and governments have created for them Realising the past and present negative attitudes that have resulted from discriminatory barriers degrading exploitating cruel and unjust treatment committed against people with disabilities which in turn has been a denial of human basic rights by their governments  in><+_at> different levels Reaffirming our rights to fundamental life liberty equality security and all other rights belonging to mankind irrespective of their social status religious disability gender or other considerations Aware of the discrimination unfair treatment and exploitation to which people with disabilities have been and continue to be subjected in all areas of social political and economic life and participation as well as their marginalisation degradation and abuse of women and children Reaffirming again the need to involve people's disabilities and their organisations in all matters affecting them especially at decision making and policy formulation levels national planning and social reconstruction on matters affecting disabled persons We therefore would like to part to put forward the following resolutions and uh put to the government of the east African region and uh to the following demands with urgency they *they> deserve One EAFOD should take a long road to ensure equal and full participation of women with disabilities in all its structures which will eventually permeate their total involvement and participation at local national and regional  level><+_levels> Mindful that in some countries in the region women including women with disabilities have no right to RRRto inheritance EAFOD has resolved to fight for this evil practice to be abolished be it set up it's  backed by legislative or traditional law Two EAFOD should fight with their respective governments in the region for their rights to education health employment housing transport information etcetera Number three United Nations and its agencies should unreservedly condemn and isolate regimes which allow the violation of the rights of disabled people such as dragging disabled people from villages to urban centres to turn them into clubs of beggars for the benefit of those perpetrating the *violators> At the same time the United Nations and its agencies and governments should take every necessary step to ensure that child labour which has been on the increase in recent years is pulled to a halt Four Governments in eastern Africa in consultation with national associations of the deaf should accept and develop sign language as an official language of deaf persons Five Governments in eastern Africa should take it as their obligation toward ensuring that people with disabilities are provided with free and appropriate assisted devices for  the> independent living Six Having disagreed with WHO definition of CBR CBR means Community Based Rehabilitation which is <O/> the participants emphasised the need for DPI and its structure to redefine the present CBR concept so that its components embody total development of disabled people their full participation and rehabilitation of the community Seven EAFOD should take every necessary step to run their day to day activities democratically Those with experience should impart knowledge to the young and emerging leaders as well as avoid dictatorial tendencies of having lifetime leaders Eight EAFOD should strive for total unity of disability groups and the organisation of eastern Africa through exchange of information and visits training programme sharing of resources and promoting marketing of products produced by the disabled people Nine EAFOD should strive for increased development of eastern Africa and southern African co-operation in all fields of development as a step towards the formation of a Pan African Federation of the Disabled Ten which is the last but not least resolution EAFOD should through its national governments and authorities in the region formulate and enforce comprehensive legislation to promote and protect the rights and interests of disabled persons and thereby ensure disabled persons of access to all community services These are the ten point recommendations or resolutions rather which were adopted by the uh RRRthe participants of the workshop and uh these of course are going to be distributed to all governments of the region and then we'll have to RRRto make a follow-up to see that these resolutions don't end up in dustbins as it happened in some countries where the world programme of action concerning disabled persons was put in the dustbin up to the mid-term evaluation when other governments were IIIeve RRRwere not even aware that that United Nations document was available So with these few remarks honourable guests uh I would like to RRRto RRRto welcome the director of uh social welfare Zanzibar to

Your Excellencies ambassadors and heads of foreign missions distinguished representatives of international organisations esteemed workshop participants invited guests ladies and gentlemen it gives me great pleasure to have been invited to officiate the opening of this important meeting I wish to commend the commission for land and environment of the ministry of water construction energy land and environment together with the commission for tourism of the ministry of information culture tourism and youth for organising this very important workshop I also wish to convey my special thanks to the Royal <O/> Netherlands embassy in Nairobi the Finnish International Development Agency and the Global Environment Facility Programme in Tanzania for their great assistance in convening this meeting which is a follow-up BBBa follow-upRRR to the BBBto theRRR Zanzibar National Environment policy <O/> workshop held in July nineteen ninety-four On behalf of the government and the people of Tanzania and of Zanzibar in particular and on my own behalf I take this opportunity to welcome you all It is my hope however that you will be able yet to perceive a tinge of warmth and cordiality from amongst the citizens during your stay here and please do feel at home Mr Chairman I don't need to stress the urgency of this workshop at this stage of Zanzibar's tourism development since tourism is now the world the world's fastest growing industry and according to the nineteen ninety-two report of the World Travel and Tourism Council between nineteen seventy and nineteen ninety the number of tourists travelling in the world grew by nearly three hundred per cent It is expected to grow by half again before the turn of the century Tourism is now in the  throe><+_throes> of being regarded as one of the world's largest industries employing about one hundred and twelve million people world-wide and paying about US dollars five hundred and forty thousand million in wages and salaries It is <O/> that the tourism industry will be responsible for IIIseve for seven per cent of total capital investment in nineteen ninety-five The fastest growth is being witnessed in travel to new destinations and in so-called ecotourism the <O_><O/>of environmental issues in important tourist markets of the developed countries Mr Chairman Zanzibar tourism development during its infancy stage is a BBBis aRRR mere abstraction of no exception to the global situation due to what is reported above The very trust to economic organisation made by the Zanzibar government over the past ten years is an attempt to diversify BBBto diversifyRRR <O_><O/> of isles away from the from its earlier dependence on the mono-<O/> economy The tourism industry has assumed a broader capacity in Zanzibar's national economic development plan Zanzibar is widely IIIreco IIIreco IIIreco recognised as having foreseen the opportunity for tourism development and it has foreseen that the tourism industry will soon become a major source of employment as well as a natural earner of both local revenue and foreign exchange By the year two thousand it is planned to be not less than six thousand hotel beds in operation in <O_><O/> So far just one thousand two hundred beds are in operation though currently a further one thousand five hundred beds are under construction around the coast of Unguja The UUUmessage in Pemba is far less IIIa advanced now with just three government hotels and three guest houses serving the whole islands It may perhaps be important to inform the western delegates that Pemba has more attractive scenery interrupted by gentle views all through with more beautiful beaches than the island of Zanzibar It has more rainfall which means all RRRall the more greening lasts throughout the year My pen I'm afraid cannot give a better description than a sight-seeing The <O/> is very much aware that uncertainty of water and power is a major obstacle to serious investment in Pemba Conversely employment will continue to be even more a problem and it is our intention and the government it is trying her best to make sure that those two monstrous IIIhin IIIhin hindrances are solved as soon as time could allow Esteemed delegates it may be good to mention that other segments of the tourism industry are also developing to keep pace with the increase of tourists arrivals which have risen by twenty per cent per year since nineteen eighty-five This is about uh sixty-four thousand tourists in nineteen ninety-two Recently fifteen of Zanzibar's leading IIIto tour operators formed themselves into a uh an organisation called ZATO the Zanzibar Association of Tour Operators which was registered in nineteen ninety-three Several registered IIIdr dive and marine sports operators have also started to emerge The UNDP's operated hotel management school at Manihubi is in the second year of operation with a capacity of seventy-two students Mr Chairman as partly concern amounts over the growing threat of the global environment and attention focuses on the need to manage the major resources more sustainably the human IIIcom community has now to assume a more conscious attitude and the operations of the world's major industries must now come under increasing scrutiny It is important therefore to bring tourism as one tool in global and growing industry within the general debate for sustainable development It RRRit'll RRRit is the intention of the Zanzibar government to develop a high class environmentally IIIcons environmentally sensitive tourism industry that brings benefit thus to the BBBto theRRR national economy and to the BBBto theRRR local areas in which tourists IIIve tourist activities are concentrated and which contribute to the protection of Zanzibar's national heritage culture and environment The government has every intention to improve and preserve the pearl of this history being the Zanzibar Old Stone Town with all the urge to restore the life of all the palaces and castles in both Zanzibar and Pemba The old mosques and the archaeological findings will all be put into view Very rare species of flora and fauna will be nurtured with maximum care for the tourists and  the> posterity Perhaps the charm and friendliness of the people they do take part may add a great deal to oncoming cordiality of the islands of Zanzibar Mr Chairman allow me to take this opportunity to assure members of this IIIgath gathering and through them the public that those fears which germinated from IIIreligi religious enthusiasm over the question of tourism had not that effect nor bearing to the teaching of Koran nor the directives of Prophet Mohammed We know for sure that they have nothing other than political motives These granted political demagogues sometimes find it easier to pass through the avenue of RRRof religion in order to arrive at their political heaven Islam's Islamic scholars BBBIslamic scholarsRRR have proved beyond all doubt that Koran makes very clear and clean mention about tourism Walk on the land and see Whether <O/> or from God it is my hope that all of us shall co-operate together towards achieving this objective and that the <O/> of Zanzibar's culture shall forever remain a centre of tourist attraction It IIIma RRRit may again be rightly speaking that uh the Zanzibar government is now in the process of producing plans for the IIIesub for the establishment and management of nature conservation areas These have the potential to channel money from the tourism industry <O/> into the conservation of some of Zanzibar's richest and most important natural ecosystems Such areas however need to be well managed taking RRRtaking into account the main local communities who are the traditional users of areas and <O/> as well as the requirement of conservation in tourism Mr Chairman what has been obtained most <O/> on tourism in the developing world is the interest of the IIIindus industry <O_><O/> to the local culture While it is not easy to IIIda deny the fact it would be wrong to magnify it beyond proportion Tourism planning is certainly the essential criterion that will be used to safeguard the purpose It is my IIIbe belief BBBit is my beliefRRR that the areas of such destructive influence must be borne in mind by both the tourists the tourist and the citizen for it is through their amicable and mutual co-operation that the industry can survive Mr Chairman it is UUUneedless to reiterate  to> the theme of the workshop which is ecotourism and environment Ecotourism and environment cannot be singled out as an BBBas anRRRBBBas anRRR agenda for one country since the earth is a IIIpl RRRis aRRR <O/> village for all of us It is interrelated among countries and nations in and among species of all BBBof allRRR denominations We have to work together towards a common goal by arousing the consciousness of the sustainable growth sustainable economy and sustainable development The present generation may be doing a great disservice to itself and to their  offsprings><+_offspring> unborn if it BBBif itRRR shall not be IIIcare if it shall not be careful enough to the assessment of their own values In the tropical rain forests about seventeen million hectares of trees are being cleared away every year or around fifty thousand hectares per day Under those circumstances man through his IIIur through his urge for a better life can be the most destructive animal under the sun About the close of this century the relationship between the human world and the place that RRRthat sustains it has undergone a profound change When the century began neither human members nor <O_><O/> had the power radically to alter <O/> system As the century closes the total of vastly increased human numbers and the activities have that power but major unintended changes are occurring in the atmosphere in cells in waters and in plants and animals and in the relations in the relationships among all of these The rate of change is outstripping the ability of scientific discipline in our current ability to assess and advance It is frustrating the attempts of medical and economic situations which RRRwhich evolved in a different more fragmented world to adapt and cope It deeply worries many people who are seeking ways to place their concerns on the political agendas The mental IIIdegra degradation first seen BBBfirst seenRRR as mainly a problem of the rich nations in a search of it  of><+_for> a better life has become a survival issue for developing nations It is part of the downwards downward spiral of linked ecological and economical decline in which many of the poorest nations are trapped Despite official hope expressed on all sides no change IIIidentif IIIid identifiable today no programmes or policies offer any real hope of narrowing the growing gap between rich and poor nations At the start of our development <O_><O/> the path that this nation has followed for millions of years in the creating a planet our ancestors would want to recognise Humanity has the ability BBBHumanity has the abilityRRR to make development sustainable to ensure that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs The concept of sustainable development does imply limits not also limits but limitations imposed by the present state of technology on social organisation and environmental resources and by the ability of the BBBof theRRR biosphere to absorb the <O/> of human activities but technology and social organisation can be both managed and improved to make way for a new era of economic growth Lastly Mr Chairman ecotourism and environment must be handled at one and the same time through concerted efforts that embody the co-operation of all states and governments in the <O/> of individuals The government of Zanzibar will do all she can to educate herself and her people towards the need for more understanding of the intricacies and applications of these two topics
We ask you all ladies and gentlemen to feel all too free to air BBBto airRRR your views and suggestions for the benefit of the people of Zanzibar and beyond And in conclusion Mr Chairman I wish you every success in reporting a task ahead and take the opportunity now to declare this workshop on ecotourism and environment open I thank you very much

Chairperson uh Assistant Commissioner for Social Welfare Tanzania mainland Director for Social Welfare Tanzania island the UNDP representative the representative of EAFOD uh let's not forget the manager for Bwawani Hotel here workshop participants invited guests ladies and gentlemen first of all I would like to thank you most sincerely for the great honour and privilege you have given me to close this seminar The holding of this seminar in Zanzibar is a great honour to Tanzania for which we Tanzanians are very grateful I would like to take this opportunity on my behalf and on behalf of the government of Tanzania as well to thank all the distinguished guests and seminar participants for your kind participation in this programme I hope that your brief stay in Zanzibar has been both fruitful and enjoyable and especially because you are  in><+_on> an island of perfume Zanzibar is renowned for its unrivalled perfumes from Pemba and also for its people's hospitality I trust you that you have enjoyed the fascinating scent of the Zanzibar perfume Chairperson I wish to extend my special  gratitudes><+_gratitude> to delegates representatives of EAFOD Your attendance at this workshop has enabled it to be a success and it is an inspiration to the people of eastern Africa who are struggling to achieve social economic and political liberation through co-ordination and co-operation among themselves Chairperson I have been informed that you have been here for one week deliberating on issues concerning disabled persons in our region and that you did visit around the island I believe this exercise has enriched your vision on your duties lying ahead of you With the exchange of experience you have had I'm sure your tasks will not be difficult It can be done so play your part Chairperson again on my behalf and on behalf of the government of Tanzania I wish to congratulate you for the formation of  a> regional co-operation You have taken the right channel to form the Eastern African Federation of the Disabled which is the right tool in the struggle for your rights Chairperson your federation has been wise to see the need for the training of trainers Training enables people to do their jobs in a systematic manner and having identified their skill gaps as regards knowledge skill and attitudes as you have said yourself in the resolution now they need special attention Some societies had disregarded them some time ago and some still segregate them Chairperson I'm glad to say that our country Tanzania is aware of the problems facing this group of persons We have been trying our best to integrate them in all our social and economic development activities according to our economic ability During the fiscal year of nineteen ninety-two nineteen ninety-three about two hundred and twenty-two disabled people attended courses in different special training institutions for disabled They were trained in agriculture animal husbandry crafts-making electronics carpentry etcetera Chairperson I'm glad to mention that Tanzania is also ahead in caring for its disadvantaged people as follows About seventy-three people I mean disabled people were employed Two hundred and fifty-six were assisted self-employment Four uh about them were given motorbikes Fifty were given three-wheeled bikes Fifty-one were given artificial legs or arms shoes and guidesticks Two hundred disabled in Iringa village were given loans to the tune of seventeen uh million to enable them start small  business><+_businesses> under the Community Based Rehabilitation Plan Our projected plan for nineteen ninety-three nineteen ninety-four is to train about one seventy-nine disabled people Fifty are to be trained on in vocational training centres and other trade schools All this will be done in collaboration with UNDP ILO SHIA and all who intend to raise a revolving fund for the disabled for IIIsitt for setting up small business projects to assist them under the Community Based Rehabilitation Scheme Chairperson I have only been trying to show how Tanzania our country is striving to assist and accommodate the disabled person Much of this data is based on Tanzanian mainland experience but also in Zanzibar here I was also told that the government has tried its RRRits best It gave them an office so that they make it as  headquarter><+_headquarters> It also gave them one flat so that they can rent and get money so that they can generate funds for themselves and uh most of their let us say seminars sometimes they get some funds from the government so it shows both Tanzania mainland and Tanzania island are taking care of our disabled people So I believe all our countries will do the same Chairperson another area which requires extra effort from all areas especially among the disabled  person><+_persons> themselves is that of social equity Everywhere we have of late heard of social equity which advocates equitable distribution of benefits in IIIdevelme RRRin development throughout the society However people in the rural areas and the disabled persons rarely benefit This has to be rectified and those who are supposed to advocate for this change are the disabled persons yourselves Chairperson here I need also to mention the plight of the disabled women Women in general have struggled very hard to be where they are now and they still struggle to get their rights and recognition I've no doubt disabled women in our societies are more disadvantaged than their male counterparts Many of them are left behind and they are not given the chance to participate in decision-making and taking other leadership roles Disabled women are denied the basic human rights of education training economic independence and participation in society compared to their fellow disabled men Social cultural attitudinal and structural barriers play a significant role in undermining the women's development I'm sure you have a different attitude I have IIIin I have been told that in the federation executive committee there is a gender balance I've BBBI haveRRR also been informed that Disabled Peoples International of which you are a part of has a solid stand to see to it that in all its governing councils and representations right from the grassroot level there is an equal representation between male and female gender This is very encouraging and I congratulate these bodies for realising this deficiency Chairperson during your <O/> meeting with the  participant><+_participants> here you have exchanged a lot of information and some of you have developed that important human link of friendship But friendship gets its test of being honest and genuine relationship when those who regard themselves are far apart This is the right occasion to prove that the friendship you have cultivated is an honest one Dear participants this can be done by promoting an exchange of information If one of your national  association><+_ associations> has found a way to cope with a particular problem this information may be of great use to people in other member countries of the federation Chairperson and dear participants before I conclude I would like to offer on behalf of the government of Tanzania our gratitude to the local organising committee under the leadership of Mr Khalfan Hemed Khalfan for his tireless effort which has made this gathering a success I also extend my thanks to those who supported the workshop in one way or the other Also this my gratitude has to go to the United Nations Disability Unit New York the Netherlands Organisation for International Development Co-operation the Commonwealth Foundation and the Royal Danish Embassy in Tanzania who have generously financed this training programme I also extend my thanks to <./nat> to the national institution and business community for their contribution Chairperson dear participants I wish you all a happy and a safe journey back home and with these few remarks I officially declare your one week workshop closed Thank you very much

Mr Chairman of uh TAPO <name/> members of TAPO distinguished participants ladies and gentlemen it is an honour for me to officiate the official opening of this annual symposium of the Tanzania Association of Parastatal Organisations After receiving your invitation I've taken some trouble to learn about TAPO and its activities I must say that I am impressed by TAPO's forward-looking traditions and its readiness to traverse areas of controversy but uh of significance to the parastatals and to our economy yes even to our body politic How fortunate Mr Chairman we all are that our parastatals in Tanzania have TAPO to bring them together in a IIIcorron in RRRin a common forum More important how fortunate we have we are to have an organisation that is ready to look into the future to prepare for it and indeed to influence it I want to commend TAPO and its leadership its membership for achieving these perspectives <ea/>bongesi Mr Chairman statistics show that the Tanzania parastatal BBBthe Tanzania parastatalRRR cannot be ignored in planning our economy The parastatal sector has the capacity to contribute significantly to the economic well-being of our country Unfortunately it also has a capacity to drag the economy of our country backwards and thus harming the aspirations of our people Mr Chairman there is evidence that the parastatal sector can exhibit a great deal of creativity efficiency and a sense of accountability Unfortunately there is also evidence of some parastatals that are the sick creatures of our economy and the worst examples of lack of imagination inefficiency and irresponsibility This is the parastatal predicament This is what makes the behaviour of the parastatal sector so unpredictable Mr Chairman consider the following phenomena In nineteen eighty-five a hundred and thirty-eight parastatals had their accounts unaudited What a situation In nineteen eighty-nine parastatals in this category were reduced to IIIeigh RRRto eighty-five from hundred and thirty-eight This is quite an achievement but certainly not a complete achievement Nineteen eighty-five in nineteen eighty-five thirty-seven point uh one per cent of parastatals received clean certificates from the auditors In nineteen eighty-nine this figure jumped to  nineteen><+_ninety> fifty-one point one per cent This shows a capacity by the parastatals to improve significantly their handling of accounts In the view of the topic chosen for this year's uh uh BBBchosen for this year'sRRR TAPO's symposium we should note the importance of proper bookkeeping and financial management and discipline that a parastatal ought to have if it is to be commercially viable On the whole we have cause for hope Reading through the reports of the RRRthe Tanzania Audit Corporation the number of uh BBBthe number ofRRR uh uh certified uh of clean certificates BBBthe number of clean certificatesRRR were reduced dramatically No the number of no-opinion certificates were reduced dramatically from sixty-five to three in the period nineteen eighty-five to nineteen eighty-nine and partially clean certificates uh dropped from hundred and fifty-nine to forty-one during the same period Mr Chairman I repeat Tanzania cannot afford to ignore the state of the parastatal sector As for the party and the government the parastatal sector will continue to be important because of its double-track impact Uh consider the revenue enjoyed by the government through taxation In nineteen eighty-seven eighty-eight parastatals contributed shillings four point nine billion to treasury In nineteen eighty-nine ninety the treasury enjoyed a revenue of uh shillings ten point five billion On the other hand losses in the parastatal sector rose from shillings uh two RRRtwo billion point eight uh in nineteen eighty-five to shillings twenty-nine billion point one in nineteen eighty-nine The National Milling Corporation alone is said to have cost the government treasury about uh eight billion BBBeight billionRRR shillings during its lifetime Let me make a political statement about this predicament of the status of the parastatal sector in our economy The party will not be so foolish as to ignore the positive aspects of our parastatals in terms of their contribution to investment mobilization growth of national productive capacity supply of essential goods and services availability of employment Nor will the party ever ignore the parastatal role in providing the necessary competition to the firms in the private BBBin the privateRRR sector and to balancing the ethnic question of ownership of means of production and IIIdis distribution in our country Mr Chairman on the other hand CCM and its government can no longer hesitate to take the necessary measures to counter the negative economic manifestations in our parastatals such as perpetual losses in some of them disorganized management systems and dependence on  the> government money or bank loans that are not paid Mr Chairman today in this symposium of  Tanzania><+_Tanzanian> Association of Parastatal Organisation you are discussing commercialization of the parastatals in Tanzania Let me quickly agree that that is indeed what is happening in Tanzania I believe that the intensity towards such commercialization will grow and not lessen at all that the insensitivity towards such commercialization will grow and will not lessen at all There is no future in Tanzania for economic parastatals which cannot stand on their own but are perpetually bailed out by the taxpayers through subsidies from the government treasury I cannot see any future for training parastatals which cannot or will not make profits from their operations Mr Chairman such parastatals are doomed Yes Mr Chairman and members of TAPO our parastatals must go commercial and must make profits It is clear that the people of Tanzania have exhausted their patience with respect to parastatals which believe that they have a right to exist even if they are not earning that right or are not even trying to earn it I believe ideology alone is no longer a <O/> alibi for loss-making parastatals to shield in The party and the government I believe that the RRRthe people as well are now no under no illusion that loss-making and subsidy dependent parastatals are a liability and not an asset to our efforts for economic recovery Such parastatals are a discredit not a credit to the policy of socialism and self-reliance Tanzania is going through a sea change right now uh not unlike that which is occurring in the world around us The sea change will IIIno RRRwill demand political reforms but also particular changes in economic perceptions prospectives and values In this situation men of RRRmen and women I must say men and women I wrote men here men and women of old ideas and views will be seen as archaic and as an obstacle to advancement of our nation and its economy They will and I think they are being discarded In economics and business Tanzania has already reached a stage of giving great appreciation to results on the welfare of the people and not just to forms of ownership of an enterprise Appreciation will go to the IIIenper enterprise that delivers at least cost BBBthat delivers at least costRRR and with efficiency regardless of whether it is a public or a private institution of an BBBof an<_/> IIIenter enterprise I believe Mr Chairman that time has arrived and ought to arrive the time for giving the parastatal monopoly status is gone The IIIti RRRthe time for IIIfollo RRRfor allowing competition on serving the public has come The time for tolerating a sluggish management in the parastatals that cannot seize investment opportunities that cannot cut costs even when IIIopport opportunities exist that cannot compete in the marketing functions that cannot motivate its labour that will not make necessary but difficult decisions the time for such management in Tanzania is gone Are these policies and views uh Mr Chairman some of you might RRRmight be wondering are these policies and views mine or are they part of the official party and government policy They are implied in the decisions of the party to promote equally both the public and private investment through the investment code They are implied in the liberalisation of external and internal trade They are implied in the decisions of the <name/> commission report with its emphasis on opening up to the public purchase of shares stocks and ventures including those in the banking sectors These positions are already being implemented in the decision to ask loss-making parastatals to seek salvation not from the Treasury but from the private investors through such schemes as joint ventures uh partnerships and indeed IIIprivat privatization Mr Chairman let me tell you my friends from the parastatal sectors those who have eyes to see would have III see BBBwould haveRRR already seen those with ears to hear will have heard and those with audacity to seize new  opportunity><+_opportunities> will see the situation as not threatening but definitely challenging Let me say that the drive for commercialization of our parastatals must be accompanied by measures that enable parastatals to play this IIIro RRRthis role You have yourself mentioned some of them These policy and practical measures must include a real granting of autonomy to parastatal enterprises and IIIindepen RRRand companies It is vital that most decisions that affect their performance and discretion must be restored to the management and boards of directors of the parastatals themselves These should include decisions on employees' morale and motivation quality quantity and prices of goods and services produced financial decisions etcetera Such types of decision must no longer reside outside the parastatals I hope our friends from uh RRRfrom uh <name/> are not too worried about this statement I also believe that in certain cases especially where there is  a> stiff competition from external producers government should review taxation policies including level of sales tax for home-produced goods and of customs duties for imported goods All these measures should create the right environment for parastatals to apply themselves with full vigour on the basis of normal commercial principles and practices There may be these and other measures which are necessary to make a success of IIIpri RRRof privatisation of the BBBof the<_/> parastatal sector <ea/>Ndugu Chairman gentlemen and ladies from the parastatal sector don't wait for somebody to point such RRRsuch policies and decisions which you need You must do it yourselves and in a forum like this one there is an opportunity for enlightening the party and for enlightening the government Mr Chairman ladies and gentlemen thank you for according me this honour I now declare the TAPO annual symposium of nineteen ninety-one officially open

I would like to thank the minister very much for his contribution of these personal views about multipartism because I believe he did not speak as a minister but as a human being who is free to contribute his ideas in a free country I agree with him .
I'm Pastor Christopher Mtikila uh uh I agree with both the two previous speakers to a large extent except where it touches on the feasibility of multipartism in Tanzania Maybe to be more precise and to be better understood I should define what is the meaning of human rights of civil rights of democracy and a political party I understand human rights to be the rights of human beings be them blue green or white wherever they are provided they have not resigned from humanity to become other things Then there <O/> a separate entitlement to those rights Civil rights is what we were fighting for under the umbrella of TANU way back in the late fifties and achieved them I think on the ninth December sixty-one or sixty-two I don't know what we got in each in both the years but the two years consolidated our entitlement to civil rights And what TANU was actually fighting for was not good roads was not bread butter and cheese I think we had plenty from England those days and very cheaply It was nothing It was only the human right to participation one's participation in his own country and we said we were by then nine and a half million people so all of us were human beings So each one of the nine and a half human beings had entitlement to that civil right Anyway a few breaths away uh a smaller group from the nine and a half million people grabbed that right from the rest of the people That's what I understand I always have difficulty  of><+_in> merging reality and diplomacy when I deliver my speeches You can do it to suit your own understanding anyway Now democracy there people talk about multiparty democracy and one party democracy But I read English I think as much as you did I want to think that democracy is the right to freedom of opinion and the right to freedom of expression of that opinion and the right to freedom of participation in the ruling in the governing in the running of one's own country through that freely opted-for opinion So when we talk about a democratic country we talk about a climate a political climate where we have got so many freely opted-for opinions So here it is important to know what a political party is then A political party is supposed to be one such opinion one political party is one such opinion which is shared by a group of individuals of a particular country who commit themselves fully to that opinion making an identity between that opinion and their own virtues It is an entitlement So I would oppose anybody who would say for the shortcomings economically and socially in our country we do away with the party which is responsible for this It would be very sinful because they have their entitlement They must be there and I was sent to defend them and join them if they BBBif theyRRR change But that would not give me entitlement to grab other people's similar right because after all our banner is human equality So when we talk about multipartism we should be careful about bringing in the word feasibility In the sixties we had a bitter war which we fought using the United Nations and so many international fora We were trying to convince people in the west to reason with us that we are as equal human beings as they are We were rejecting their suggestions that we were IIIun uncivilised we were a cursed race even when they tried to equate us intelligently and diplomatically to monkeys We resisted it in the strongest terms until they came to agree with us that we were on equal status So those people are human beings and they decided to agree also that we were also human beings So the united the RRRthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights under articles nineteen IIItwent twenty-one twenty-three sections one to three and twenty-five section one which describe which enshrine the sacred human rights of every human being wherever he is and to which our system here is signatory IIIforce forces those people to help us remember that we agreed we are going to be as equal human beings as them Now since they observe human rights in their homes in Europe and America etcetera etcetera we should do the same here So if we turn to them and say RRRuhu we understand that we fought for this equality very much but as for human rights we shall have to think about it if is feasible in our country because we don't have only human beings we also have got other things other than human beings Is that to say so We cannot talk about economy we cannot talk about social uh eventualities and justify them to deny us the rights civil rights in the country or human rights We cannot talk about events in other countries which led to their search for human rights in their own countries because we have entitlement here whether or not there are changes in Europe or in Eastern Europe It is an entitlement be ourselves be us educated or not we need to feel part of the population of this country So if it is a human right for any human being wherever he is in his or BBBin his orRRR her own country to have a share in the governing of that country of being elected to government or electing then if I'm denied here automatically and straight away without any compromise I'm being denied ingredients of my humanity which I probably should seek elsewhere I don't know whether I should cross borders and go and seek my human rights in other people's countries So I appreciate all the changes taking place elsewhere in the world even in South Africa for that matter where we RRRwe have been I think in the forefront fighting apartheid because we are not racists we say because the majority were denied civil rights in their own country They had more bread more butter better houses better education better everything but they felt more comfortable when they came here as refugees because they found us enjoying civil rights which they are denied in their home at their home Whether they were denied the rights because of pigment or not I remember our country has always supported people who were denied such rights by the people of their own IIIpigm pigments in their own countries So I would say there is a another version of apartheid in other countries that apartheid is of a group of stronger people who grab all the power from their fellow citizens like our system here that is black to black apartheid So what we are doing now is we should not debate on whether human rights would be good for those who have been politically deprived People are misunderstanding us and I'm misunderstanding myself and even those the integrity of those people who say so I freely say and that uh I cannot lose touch with reality And even the commission I thank the first speaker and our chairman He's praised it very much and has told told us the sense of the commission being there I totally disagree with the idea of forming that RRRthat commission if it's for looking for views as to whether human right would be good suitable for the human beings of Tanzania because that would justify what the western has used to say that we are a barbaric race etcetera etcetera Today we have lost the privilege of defending ourselves by forming such commissions But if it were a commission to go and prepare and look out how we shall reinstitute human rights in our country I would write an application to the chairman of CCM to be included in that commission So we should not go away we should not mention any other thing Even thieves and murders if they are they have nation if they have got citizenship anywhere they are they are entitled to civil rights Their crimes are very very different they cannot sabotage their rights they cannot take them away They have also got their civil rights to imprisonment if they fall criminal But we are not going to deny them That is the most important thing we should talk about The second speaker mentioned about the Zanzibar revolution Maybe that was very good because it helped me explain a little about the democracy that we have and the need for multipartism in our country The problem is not that people did not think about their rights their civil rights in this country They have always been knowing that they have the right and our constitution also states very clearly that we have got these political rights to multipartism There are so many contradictions in our constitution and there are people who try to walk in that constitution to to demand their civil rights We know what happened to them They were tortured victimised and imprisoned etcetera etcetera until one man IIIout outside the constitution said that we can now debate the human rights He is not sure whether we are really human beings to deserve human rights So that RRRthat IIIcon convinces me to believe that a monoparty state a monoparty a supreme party is a personal property because the man at the top can never be opposed The <name/> party in Iraq can never oppose Mr IIISaba RRRMr Saddam Hussein and so many other examples So with our union it is very difficult I think what we should be discussing is how we should amend innovate our constitution to be suitable to suit the changes which we desire because with a union I RRRI doubt very much if the commission would even come out with anything because the parliament in parliament one a IIIsix uh sixty thousand Zanzibaris islanders are represented by one man So all of the BBBof theRRR people in the islands are represented If we take the same ratio to the mainland we find that in a population of twenty-four million only twenty-three million and four hundred thousand are represented in parliament If we take we IIItran transfer that under the umbrella in the principle of equality the same representation in Zanzibar we take it to the mainland so we see even there the democracy is so loose I'd not see it because we take sixty thousand people of mainland Tanzania and pick a representative for them So we shall have all of them representing only six hundred thousand like the Zanzibaris So all others are unrepresented There are all these things and we talk about national consensus on in all our national uh decisions I would not remember to have had one national consensus for the union anyway because I remember the former president said that what we are going to discuss about is not the question whether we need one party or many parties but how we are going to institute a one-party system 
So there was no consensus national consensus there That's what he said He said we are not going to discuss about whether multi-partism is good or monopartism no We are only going to discuss about how to institute a one-party system National consensus is out there Even the union as RRRas actually for the union I've got a very very funny idea about it all
Yaah actually I have almost finished what I wanted to say only that on the question of the union again there was no national consensus It was something that was done single-handedly by one person although he had some good reasons to assign to his decision which does not uh BBBdoes notRRR tally with democracy anyway so multipartism is true democracy because it represents the ideas and the thinking of all other people such that even economically and socially we had antagonised the ideas some very positive ideas of people because they thought outside the framework of the one party so we threw away what they had to offer to this country because they should offer it under an IIIum a political umbrella of a party So the country's fallen casualty to all the  predicament><+_predicaments> that every one understands So human rights civil rights and democracy and the meaning of a political party should guide us in thinking about whether the commissions are right or not and whether we should have any debate on human rights at all because we'd be resigning from humanity if we do so 
S2B056T
For a number of reasons I decided to restructure my paper Although the title is the same It's on recent land changes in land tenure and its implication in the livelihood communities in the drylands of Tanzania Now there is a myth in Tanzania that land is so abundant uh that uh we don't have to worry and yet there are tenural shortages and these tenural shortages is especially acute in the areas of the dryland mainly because of the IIIappro BBBbecause of theRRR conflicts between the appropriate type of conventional theories regarding dryland use and two because of the social dimensions of the problems of livelihood of pastoralists and agro-pastoralists The importance of land even to people in the drylands cannot be exaggerated because land gave people identity it gave them their basic resource uh and above all it was a method of both livelihood and survival of the community In terms of the land use I think the nineteen twenty-three uh land ordinance of Tanzania was extremely important because it introduced a duality system uh of tenure in which there was a deemed right versus the title rights And what is interesting is that this duality moved at Independence and it is now being tried to be justified under the liberalisation uh model that Tanzania is trying to adapt or adopt Now putting changes in land tenure in context in the socio-political changes that have taken place in the country I think are extremely important and it is in here that one of the reasons why I'm particularly interested in this is that the country as a whole is more agrarian based rather than pastorally based The arid lands The climatic boundaries define where it is roughly an area of uh between six hundred and eight hundred millimetres of rainfall where permanent agriculture is not possible and there are various uh figures given as to how big this area is the semi-arid is The figure varies from between twenty-five to seventy-five per cent of the country and between thirty-five and seventy-five per cent of the country Those are two RRRtwo extremes really If you notice the figure of seventy-five per cent that does not occur all RRRall RRRall the time and so I think critical are the twenty-five and thirty-five per cent of the country Roughly speaking this is in the centre of the country To me the heartland of the dry areas are that boundary there but when we talk about seventy-five per cent it could be once in every five or seven years or eleven years depending uh you'll find that the boundary extends to this other extreme giving us our seventy-five per cent Now most people regard the drylands as homogeneous The fact of the matter is that none of this thing none of the drylands are really homogeneous and it is in here that for example we'll find juxtapositions between pastoralists you have people practising irrigation And yet the general practices in the country particularly uh with the abolishment of the uh BBBof theRRR uh customary rights these things uh are completely distorted to give an impression that we're dealing with a homogeneous system Changes which occurred in the tenural system I think uh are at present moment under great uh they are under great uh uh pressure to conform African governments both and the people are  in><+_under> enormous pressure to conform to western norms and number one to remain as primary producers and two to extend into non-traditional exports for example flowers vegetables citrus etcetera which tend to move into the semi-arid areas and into the arid areas And lastly you've got to look at these changes in terms of progression growth and settlement We are not only dealing with numbers but access to basic rights In the drylands it's not only land alone but I'll argue that it is a cluster of resources that uh we've got to be concerned with which once again tenure does not look at uh adequately For example in the semi-arid areas and arid areas land water pasture cattle all go together In fact you can have ownership of uh cattle not only  to><+_by> individuals but also  to><+_by> the whole society There has also been concern about the marginality of improvement to the productivity of both agriculturalists as well as among the pastoralists the interventions for example have led to further scarcities These scarcities have occurred both naturally as well as because of societal pressure For example if we look at land in Tanzania although they say a lot of it is available by nineteen forty-eight per capita the distribution was roughly eleven point eight hectares By nineteen eighty-eight it's down to three point nine And not only that but we'll find that one of the main pressures in fact on the land use because of state ownership is that twenty-five per cent of the country is either in terms of national parks game reserves and an increasing amount under urban areas uh Thirdly there's this conflict between game-controlled areas national parks uh for example in the BBBin theRRR Maasai area out of the total uh area of sixty-three thousand square kilometres by nineteen forties only twenty-seven thousand  was><+_were> left to the Maasai and today even that twenty-seven per cent uh sorry twenty-seven thousand square kilometres  is><+_are> under dispute If you look at this thing a bit more closely in terms of the uh what is available for people you get this picture uh The purple border there is supposed to be the semi-arid area almost a half of the semi-arid areas and look at the amount of land that has gone into national parks uh into game controlled areas and uh the large game parks like sorry the game reserves like the <name/> One thing which has still not been considered but which is fundamentally of importance in Tanzania still today are these tsetse areas including oddly enough even in the part of the uh BBBof theRRR uh pastoral areas and this is where a lot of the problems with the Barbaig have occurred because in the past uh it meant clearing of the bush in order to uh get rid of the tsetse Now land should be looked into The RRRthe context of land ownership in Tanzania is based on number one customary rights which are user based The nineteen twenty-three ordinance as I said allowed a multiplicity of customs to RRRto RRRto be to RRRto still be perpetuated but I think at the same time although we tend to treat customary rights as something uh uniform in fact that's not true at all By nine the nineteen forties land in certain parts of the country was already being sold it was being redistributed it could be owned communally etcetera Two as I've already indicated right at the start there is this continuity of the dual system At Independence uh you might wonder why we're making such a big fuss about the state abolishing customary rights uh now whereas we didn't say anything at Independence because by then also the idea of state ownership began to come in What I'm trying to say is that both during the colonial period at Independence and at present moment the idea of state ownership is there implicitly It was first threatened in a major way by villagisation and I think now it's being threatened again by liberalisation and a factor which we have talked very little about I think also bothered by environmental factors including uh disease I'd like to elaborate on this by stating that customary land rights The origin of it is that uh there are modes of ownership which were based on entitlement There was no question in traditional society that there was a scarcity of it uh If there was a scarcity you moved you spread uh but uh everybody had a right to it and there were three modes of ownership one as a clan member two as an individual of the household three as a collective ownership of men and lastly there was also a special dimension which uh was very important in terms of collective ownership of the pastoral people Now whether you belonged to one or the other or a combination of all of them depended on the political system of the tribe and the leadership of the clan the family For example among the <name/> it was the individual who decided to move into new areas and they allowed him because if he became successful he would have more people coming in and so settlements could be fairly large depending on the individual It would also depend on the scarcity or abundance of cultivated land and after the colonial period a great deal depended on the economic crops that were being grown As a result for example of economic crops both in Bukoba and in Kilimanjaro uh land began to have a very serious market value For many reasons uh the British period did allow or it was imposed because it served the purpose of the state People became smallholder producers and it is in here that I think there is a rather interesting development by the state until villagisation for example uh the government was RRRwas uh encouraging this this dual ownership because suddenly uh the state ownership IIIconp uh concept was not only reinforced in nineteen sixty-two but it also allowed the state to pose as a developer And because it was failing to develop it decided to get involved with villagisation But there is another element too why the dual system uh was simply being tolerated in fact encouraged by the state and that is because it became a producer uh NALCO is Natural <O/> Company Millions were spent on it but it was it accounted for less than one per cent of the total national product despite spending millions into it and large tracts of land were actually taken away It became involved in food production NAFCO and of course all the problems that were associated with <O/> the sugar development etcetera It is in here too uh that one must look at land use and state intervention The state intervention business really started not in the drylands It started in areas of problems like the <name/> flood plains nineteen sixty-nine In nineteen seventy they decided to use the same techniques in other words civil servants deciding where people should remain and what they should be doing and that was implemented in Dodoma in the villages and the Dodoma operation then became the operation for the whole country between nineteen seventy-three and nineteen seventy-five The results of that were insecurity decline of productivity and a central control and a lack of participation in all the communities Now in the post-liberalisation period what we are beginning to see is the continuation of the breakdown of primary production systems loss of output unless it is externally generated For example uh the loss of RRRof output in cashew nut production has been quite dramatic uh from a hundred and twenty-five thousand tons we are producing less than thirty thousand tons entirely because of villagisation because now the fields were very far away the trees were uh abandoned uh they caught on fire quite easily and so unless you have uh external inputs the chances of recovering are very very low There has been also a change of the type of uh RRR of uh RRRof uh productivity demanded and that is for example you can produce a lot of cotton uh but if uh the markets and infrastructure is not there then I'm afraid that a people cannot really benefit In a liberalisation period too we're talking about market forces but these have been so imperfect uh that uh we cannot rely too much on them and then lastly I think what liberalisation is bringing out very very strongly is centralisation versus the de-centralisation of uh RRR of production It's in here that it is within this context of what I've said I'd like now to spend the rest of the time talking about the implication of Act Number Twenty-Two uh on the livelihood patterns Villagisation as I said was a major upheaval and it was not a question of land tenure but more a process of structures they created which were both contradictory in policy and in reality Now the Act is trying to legitimise these contradictions Number Two the contradictions in fact led to a great deal of corporisations of people

Thank you very much RRRoh Thank you very much for uh inviting me to this seminar uh As you might uh see in the paper which I've just circulated uh uh I IIIdo I think you're going to be scared by the slight change in the title The paper's entitled Interactional Features in Writing Discussions of <O/> Writers and The Role of Imaginative Composition I think it's just a change of form rather than substance so I think it won't very much <O/> for after all I'm dwelling on exactly the same thing Now this paper is based on uh uh some research that I did for my uh doctorate but of course I just adapted part of it and the basic uh point was to look into the role of interactions on writing so I tried to look into how the various patterns of interaction may affect uh the IIIwrit the political writings in secondary schools Now I'll begin first of all with a general view of the developments in the time Now as is well known uh during the last two decades especially in the United States and Britain there has recently been an IIIint an interest in trying to view writing not only as uh something that has got to be marked as something uh that is an end-product but as something which is involves both cognitive and social processes and therefore there is a reason a need for trying to study how collaboration among learners or collaboration between teachers and pupils on the one hand and between pupils and pupils themselves might enhance the process of learning Now this paper therefore is going to focus on the role of interaction in learning first and then we will see how this discourse affected uh the writing I'll now RRRI'll RRRI'll first of all try to look into the discourse in learning Now communication in the classroom is seen as a gently and too shallow constructed activity However it's now evident from studies done that teachers are seen to monopolize the classroom talk As a matter of fact according to Flander's uh study Flander in nineteen seventy he's found that teachers talk most of the time seventy per cent of teachers' IIIutt of utterances in the classroom are found to be uh teachers' utterances and uh the classroom becomes a sort of a power arena where power is exercised by the leader of authority who in this case is the teacher Now this is seen very much of course in the way the teacher allocates turns because in most cases the teacher allocates turns very rarely to pupils and that he does uh monopolize most of IIIthe BBBmost ofRRR those turns Now in view of this it has been seen in some academic circles that uh group work could somehow help us towards uh uh creating an atmosphere which would probably lead to <O/> Let me BBBlet meRRR now dwell a little bit on the role of pupil - pupil discourse How pupils could enhance their own learning through their own discourse Now most of the literature on pupil - pupil discourse that is uh talk between pupils and pupils  have><+_has> tended to hinge on the official benefits Most American studies have hinged on the RRRthe official benefits which derive for example it is assumed that uh if RRR if learners interact among themselves they can be self-confident and they can also learn to trust each other However studies done in Britain have given group-work some sort of backing by regarding it as a socio-cognitive dimension a socio-cognitive uh arena where students are able to exchange ideas where they are able to <O/> each other argue and therefore come up with something that is likely to enhance learning Now there is therefore a general consensus that group interaction  lead><+_leads> to structured and modified comprehensible input measured through certain interactional features as clarification requests uh cognition checks comprehension checks and repetitions Now these interactional features later lead to language acquisition according to studies done by some of the authors uh whose references are cited in the paper Now there are a number of psychological and psycholinguistic studies that have been done to uh reinforce this point of view chief among which are the works of uh <name/> and Piaget Now uh I don't want to deal at length here with this uh Piaget's theory for example of cognitive conflict presupposes that when learners are trying to perform a task together the fact that they sometimes uh do not agree creates a situation where uh by reaching a consensus they're able to come out with some uh brighter and more articulate ideas Now <name/> on the other hand the Russian psychologist and linguist sees co-operation transacted between the learner and an adult the centre of interactions and that this subsequently leads to learning and uh <name/> however does see that uh the child before the child reaches a stage where he's able to solve his own problems he needs to interact with others In other words here he says this is a point which he calls the learner proximal development On the other hand however the tasks which learners do do very much help to promote learning Now you have tasks for example the one-way-task uh  task><+_tasks> which do not uh enable in us to interact among us or in solving problems may not seem to be well predisposed towards learning whereas tasks which enable learners to interact or to solve problems may <O/> to help promote learning Therefore tasks not only interaction but also tasks it's the nature of the task that they should learn in the classroom will help very much to promote a sort of uh interaction uh the sort of learning that is felt to be appropriate I will now dwell upon writing on talk and see how talk as a base of interaction does could help literacy Now pupil talk has been perceived as contributing to uh you know promoting ideas before pupils are able to learn Now such work by people like Britten Graves and others have added to this sort of conception Now some of these studies into the role of talk and writing have merely looked into interactional patterns of training teacher - student or student - student writing uh for example without stating for example how these teachers affected writing However there are a few studies which have been done and which have shown that uh when teachers I mean when students interact uh in other words when they offer each other requests and when they also engage in interactional features such as uh confirmation and so on they're able to provide themselves with uh the language that they might probably use later to uh linguistic meaning and therefore be able to write something coherent Now uh in view of this therefore what were the bases of the study Now this study was intended to look into the interaction of patterns which emerge once students are engaged in discussions about writing An attempt was made to determine which interactions lead to high quality discussions and which ones led to low quality discussions by relating them to compositions written after discussion In other words the study sought to examine whether or not the interactional features of the discussions have a bearing on the discourse and hence led to interactional features as products which means that uh basically I was trying to look into how these patterns of interaction which were likely to emerge as students were working together could help them write uh their compositions Now in so doing them uh I devised my research design this way I had a target sample of twenty-four high-ability average and low-ability pupils of secondary schools who were selected after an English cloze test had been administered Now the tasks which the students did were of two types Some of these tasks were teacher-fronted that is the task was conducted mainly or directed by the teacher and the other tasks were done in groups in pairs or various groups pair being two pupils and groups being made of six pupils The tasks were involved descriptive compositions and active compositions Now if you look at the appendix which I provided because you'll find that uh there're two completely different compositions uh which were assigned One was the teacher-directed composition and the other was uh a fundamentally different composition because of pair work Now if you look at the pictures you find that uh Have a look I don't know if you can Yeah the picture you have the pictures uh This is called IIIteach teacher-fronted IIIcom composition Have it there Okay So this was the teacher-fronted composition task that was <O/> by the teacher So the teacher had to describe something and then the teacher the pupils merely wrote something Then appendix b BBBappendix bRRR we have the instructions and the task follows This was the pair work where the pupils collaborated to do some work In other words they had pictures and they developed the topic of the pictures and then they tried to talk out </>am among themselves to see what comparison they could make of the picture You can see for example appendix b in this picture there are two pictures In one picture this RRRthis picture the picture above looks to be somewhat similar to the picture below appendix b but uh we can find that there are some objects which are missing in one of the pictures so that pupils had to talk and therefore this was seen as uh being able to promote some sort of talk I mean among RRRamong the pupils Now the other one was a narrative task This again was done was levied by the teacher and was also led uh by uh also done by the pupils themselves Now after the pupils when the pupils were working I RRRI took some audiotaped transcripts So audiotapes <O/> related to the study are collected using a cassette recorder Now when the lesson ended what I did was I took the tapes of the conversation preceding the tasks and then I analysed the transcripts of the discourse that had taken place between the teacher and the pupils and among the pupils themselves Now if a teacher did the coding of utterances and of the <O/> coding scheme was used Now how the RRRthe RRRthe operation coding scheme was worked you can see in appendix d and e So I used appendix d and e to code the uh uh BBBto code theRRR interactions which took place while they were talking Then they I also coded the activities of listening reading and writing Now an additional coding scheme was designed to observe the frequency of both teachers' and pupils' behaviour as they interacted during writing lessons Now talking listening reading and writing features were further divided into discourse acts which helped shape the interaction in the classroom Now some of the discourse acts uh are the ones which you can see in appendix f In other words uh these were somewhat based on pictures and therefore I tried to code the interaction for example if he's requesting if he's repeating or simply giving information So I tried to code the interactions on the left-hand side of the transcripts You know to find out what the students were trying what utterances the students were trying to make 
Now I'll dwell on the results of the study Now I processed the RRRthe data by you know when the transcripts had been written I RRRI counted manually the frequency of these acts and later I went through the written compositions to see if the features noted in the verbal transcripts were observable in the original compositions and how these features could have been probably uh could have helped to convey information which was uh put by the students in their compositions I took a sample of twelve subjects uh These were six good performers and six bad performers Now the results of the study Now the results of the study indicated that uh the teacher's requests for students to clarify content or language form involved pupils merely completing teacher's utterances in that they are restating what the teacher had said In other words what I found was that uh if you look at the transcripts of the students uh which are provided in uh in one of these if you look at this sheet of paper which has got uh twenty-one that's page twenty-one You have the interaction of the students For example it does compare here I don't know if you have this
Twenty-one of this small sheet of paper this one Good Now what I found out what we found out is that uh in this transcript you have the students trying to exchange ideas about something they are doing and now what we see is that the students are merely repeating the teacher's utterances and that what transpires later as they write their composition that they merely repeat what they have been actually what they've been saying in the in their discussions Now what RRRwhat actually this reveals is that uh students generally tend to be unaware of the differences between uh the spoken mode and the written mode And therefore it's in view of that that they're not very BBBthey're not veryRRR competent in being able to write something uh in line with the conventions of uh of written discourse Now another observation in six two six point two on page four you'll find that requesting explanation of content or form and the repetition seems to have been a common feature of both the high performers and the low performers with the repetitions of content being prominently a feature of the finished composition Now the nature of request for example as a discourse act varied Request for clarification led to high level talk while the request for explanation did not Now this would be due to the fact that when requesting clarification for example one is likely to learn new words or structures While a request for explanation may not necessarily lead to uh a <O/> explanation Now what I mean is that uh as students are you know are requesting for explanation the student the other student may be able to provide an explanation but this explanation did not necessarily lead to high quality of talk in the sense that what the student uh  provide><+_provides> as explanation may not be helpful in making the student write properly Another observation six three point six three on IIIpa on page five was as regards the organization of the work itself of group work What I found was that the group work which involved six students sitting together afforded students better opportunities to expand on their statements to incorporate new ideas and subsequently to RRRto incorporate them in their writing themselves Now this might show that uh probably group work is more ideal than pair work but possibly in view of the fact that when you're pairing two students both of whom are not competent in the language they may not be able to sustain the conversation whereas if you're pairing students in a group there is a possibility of these students at least two or three of them being able to be competent enough Not all of them will be incompetent Now the impact of this on written composition is that the  composition><+_compositions> which were written generally uh reveal that the factors of interaction which the students displayed in their discussions were also discernible or were seen in their compositions I took a sample of twelve subjects uh These were six good performers and six bad performers Now the results of the study Now the results of the study indicated that uh the teacher's requests for students to clarify content or language form involved pupils merely completing teacher's utterances in that they are restating what the teacher had said In other words what I found was that uh if you look at the transcripts of the students uh which are provided in uh in one of these if you look at this sheet of paper which has got uh twenty-one that's page twenty-one You have the interaction of the students for example it does compare here I don't know if you have this
Twenty-one of this small sheet of paper this one Good Now what I found out what we found out is that uh in this transcript you have the students trying to exchange ideas about something they are doing and now what we see is that the students are merely repeating the teacher's utterances and that what transpires later as they write their composition that they merely repeat what they have been actually what they've been saying in the in their discussions

I would like to RRRto offer uh in summary form a discussion of findings uh of ongoing work by both myself and RRRand Dr <name/> on the language of political leadership in Tanzania uh It's Part of it is ongoing work and part of it is work that I myself have been doing for the last seven years uh Let us begin by quoting uh Sir Geoffrey Howe who was the deputy prime minister in the British government of Margaret Thatcher on the uh BBBon theRRR eve of his resignation as deputy prime minister on the thirteenth of November nineteen ninety It was quoted in the Independent London and he said
We uh myself and Dr <name/> are interested and have been interested in that RRRthat coin with the two sides you know style and substance The overall picture uh is set by uh the fact that there is growing interest in the language of political leadership among linguists and uh in this we may quote Atkinson nineteen eighty-four <name/> Atkinson discusses Reagan Thatcher Kinnock Martin Luther King and he goes back actually to Hitler Lenin and so on <name/> discussing the political leadership styles in the US nineteen eighty-seven And Wilson nineteen ninety uh attempts what he calls political leadership uh styles uh you know political speaking politically speaking in western settings and of course there you know is RRRis more recent work by Daphne and Kolinsky on uh IIIleader leadership uh political leadership styles in terms of language styles of course language speaking styles oratory styles Of course in the UK West Germany then and RRRand RRRand France uh In much of the work the interest has arisen or has coincided with the major global socio-political changes that have taken place since the oil crisis nineteen seventy-three uh which culminated in the assumption of political leadership by strong and highly personalized political figures in several countries in Western Europe for example Thatcher in the UK Mr RRRMr Mitterrand in France and in North America Mr Reagan and the RRRthe RRRthe impact of these personalities <O/> especially in terms of western scholarship as occasioning this interest among linguists uh Here in RRRin Africa in the shadow of these political changes uh we at least in Tanzania have witnessed also we have also witnessed major personnel changes especially from ninety eighty-five when you know the former founding president of the United Republic of Tanzania retired from the presidency and was succeeded by uh RRRby Mr Ali Hassan Mwinyi Now uh as the political scientist sociologist <name/> has summarised uh these changes in Tanzania in the following way He has suggested that these personnel changes in Tanzania could be characterised by nineteen eighty-five onwards could be characterised as follows The experts have displaced the politicians as the current dominant voice in the struggle for power in Tanzania A political perspective that IIIundertoo RRRthat IIIunderstoo RRRthat understood development as fundamental political process and <name/> emphasized  the> politicisation mobilisation and to some extent socialism of some sort guided Tanzanian political discourse in the late sixties and the mid-seventies The early eighties however saw a return to the view that development is primarily technical process though of course requiring supportive political environment and I'm sure those of you who attend conferences maybe every now and again on market-oriented performance they hear this word political environment a lot so RRRso that development is principally a technical process a process that economists know better how to enter not politicians but at the same time politicians are needed to create the UUUinappropriate political climate in which these technical people could perform their RRRtheir duties So it is that sort of background I mean which has occasioned you can see uh on RRRon *on> the handout which is the number the page number one ninety uh which has occasioned the kind of concerns that we thought uh and still believe would be of IIIconc of interest to a linguist and that could constitute what a linguist could call uh a unique area of contribution BBBa unique area of contributionRRR by the linguist to any ongoing socio-political changes These areas uh are to do as you can see there about five we've selected variation uh you know in the deployment of the following language forms for instance IIIproprosody features which affect pausing intonation subordination and some human behaviour like laughing We RRRwe thought you know those could merit you know investigation by linguists by a linguist and then also syntactic devices like the use of existential and passive clauses which help in the staging of message chunks Existential uh clauses would be for those who are not linguists I see uh uh clauses that have been introduced by there RRRthere are for instance There are those who etcetera There are those who you know where you know uh you know that would be along the same sort of lines as uh you know the passive clauses which again would be saying things without IIIma you know RRRwithout spelling out the authors of those things that are happening so you know a good example would be for instance say you know food is eaten instead of I eat food uh where you'd have passified and left out I eat food or people eat food and then the vocabulary choices resulting in the nouns versus verbs ratio IIIcharacter characterising human message chunks where you know as uh Halliday Michael Halliday in the nineteen eighty-five paper suggested and I quote here I think that education to uh give a paper of this one on the ideas of Michael Halliday where as I quote
Okay You know Halliday went with others to suggest that uh written discourse would be characterised by a higher proportion of nouns as opposed to verbs and you know spoken discourse you know written discourse will be characterised by a higher proportion the use of a higher proportion of nouns than verbs while spoken discourse would be characterised by you know higher proportion of use of verbs as opposed to nouns So I mean that RRRthat sort of interest we thought you know I mean is some is an area you know where you might use a UUUmoderning style and substance by political speakers UUUmoderning which is of relevance to a linguist you see And then uh number five pronominal selection which manipulate which is manipulated to realise face management or politeness pronominal selection Here we mean the use of pronouns like I or we or he or they and so on okay which are BBBwhich areRRR in a such selection as is manipulated to create either you know to reduce the extent to which people's faces are threatened in a negative or positive way I mean in the sense for instance if I want to order villagers and I'm a president to put manure into their farms I might say We have to put manure in our farms although I don't have a farm actually I'm just telling them to do it you see but I'm reducing the extent of distance between myself and them by including myself in the people who are going to put manure in the farms So the use of we uh you know is manipulative and then these dimensions we suggest they're you know you know that these dimensions along with the use of linguistic forms that vary would include <the speech mode dimension For example the style of speech delivery would vary according to whether the speech was scripted or unscripted again bringing in BBBagain bringing inRRR the idea you know <O/> by Halliday of speech versus you know written versus spoken discourse okay The study showed that the scripted the study by <name/> nineteen ninety-two shows that the scripted versus unscripted distinction tended to mirror the extent to which features that typify written discourse are IIIdeplayed deployed in the given spoken texts scripted oratory deploying more written discourse features than unscripted oratory irrespective of the speaker and I mean and you know we want to suggest that you know much as we might notice a lot of substance IIIdist differences between Nyerere and Mwinyi there are certain stylistic features that RRRthat they share And then the audience dimension IIIdistinct the audience design dimension uh which is to say the influence which is exerted on the speaker by the socio-political profiles of the participants of the speech event for example whether the audience consists of village peasants senior political senior national political leaders or a mixture of peasants workers and politicians you know who we usually call the mass you know This audience design dimension influencing the you know the style is neatly shown in the work that uh my colleague <name/> has done uh on you know say RRRon parliamentary language where code switching you know which is done there more RRRmore often than it would be done by the same politicians if they are speaking to a village audience or you know uh when especially in the past when say Julius Nyerere as the president would go out to the regions he will call he will speak > to regional leaders and there will be more English there more code switching into English And when we go to a public audience a public square you know we reduce the extent to which we code switch into English again you know showing that the audience design you know the people you are addressing influence the kind of language you might use The finally the physical dimension where you know indirect influence is exerted on your speech delivery by factors such as whether the speech is delivered in an assembly hall uh in an open field in a village in a town football stadium or a city square Okay all these are factors that definitely might uh might RRRinfluence the language the style that is Now uh very quickly maybe it will not be possible to go through all the sort of observations we've arrived at I will uh quickly go through some of the observations that are striking you know deriving from the work by <name/> ninety ninety-two on the on what he has called Tanzanian political IIIKi uh Tanzanian political Kiswahili uh Tanzanian presidential BBBTanzanian presidentialRRR Kiswahili political oratory where you know it's looking at the language of presidents when they give speeches Now a number of observations you know have been you know found and the most telling you know are the following okay uh One can make a series of points relating to the IIIinter <O/> speakers' variation within the presidential speeches in Tanzania Firstly Julius Nyerere whose style of speech ever  tend><+_tends> to be bookish Julius Nyerere's style tended to be bookish and bombastic was also one we incontestably qualified as the foremost ideology builder you know and RRRand therefore this is uh contrasted in terms of the observation with Ali Hassan Mwinyi whose speeches whose style is analysable as colloquial and now I'm using the word colloquial very carefully as it is used by RRRby <name/> to mean that it is less bookish in a positive sense actually uh right and <O/> that is used by <name/> tended to play more the role of an ideology player and less that of an ideology builder okay and a very good example in terms of vocabulary for instance would be Mwinyi's use of He interpreted phrases You know Mwinyi tended to interpret the collocative meaning range of ideologically important nominal expressions such as <ea/><O/> for instance in RRRin you know <name/> okay or <ea/></O> and you find <ea/> is an expression for capitalist in <name/> When he uses the word <ea/><O/> in <O/> where he uses <ea/><O/> for <ea/><O/> One sort of <ea/><O/> does not translate incontestably into RRRinto <ea/><O/> you know He's casting negative connotations But Mwinyi on the other hand has sought to reinterpret the terms <O/> for instance to mean you know being assertive you know and as a manager ever knowing what you are doing etcetera And also indeed actually you find <O/> Mwinyi In nineteen ninety-one I think speech to elders of Dar es Salaam which was itself actually a bit of a problem because you know I mean it was built as a speech to elders of Dar es Salaam but actually it was organised by the businessmen and he used the occasion to reinterpret the meaning of businessman to say that you know there are three categories of Tanzanian not just two you know <ea/><O/> but you'll also find <ea/><O/> where previously <ea/><O/> was interpreted to mean you know a category a subcategory of <ea/><O/> you know meaning you know a worker in the private sector you see <ea/>>O/> So now you know obviously in a way since these are terms defined clearly in RRRin documents that he would himself actually owe allegiance to or at least owe legitimacy to then it would seem that Mwinyi was in a way uh you know blurring the meaning the sort of distinction range you know and encouraging a more liberal laissez-faire you know attitude towards these documents as well as their definitions okay And very quickly you know in RRRin terms of ideology builder like Julius Nyerere uh we would say that he tended to use laughter and other prosodic features to humour his strictures against fellow political leaders whom he tended to harangue more than to lecture And I think we have an example there of Julius Nyerere there on the BBBon theRRR handout with the page one four seven There he says <ea_><ea/> humour there okay audience laughs <ea_><ea/> because obviously he's playing on humour I mean and there is a whole range of activities about humour <ea_><ea/> and yet while he was saying <ea/><O/> this was some time later in the speech it can be added that the issue wasn't picked up by the media He was encouraging the media to pick up what he was saying This is why he kept turning to it again and again one of sacking corrupt co-operative union bosses some of whom were with him on the speech platform because this was a speech he was giving for <name/> day in <name/> and you know I remember you know <name/> was there <O_><O/> and he kept referring to him you know I mean and one can and he wasn't the president then actually he was only the chairman so one can imagine he was trying to push them to do something using their speech but you know couching such you know RRRsuch strictures in humorous text so as you know not to offend some kind of uh face management you know device and he's very good at that Again and again there are many examples when he would you know he would want for instance say things which are you know like I mean once for instance he was giving a speech in Dodoma This is after the conference in nineteen eighty-six where Mwinyi in December said a number of things needed to be changed and there's <name/> in eighty-seven giving a speech celebrating twenty years of <O/> Arusha He then started by saying you know I too think there must be a few changes in <name/> and everybody clapped even those on the platform including the president of course Ali Hassan Mwinyi okay And then he followed that you know by saying you'd be amazed at the kind of things I'm going to suggest ought to be changed and then following that by saying we needed to have a bit of editing to remove things reference to TANU CCM <name/> which obviously having I mean he was telling Because Ali Hassan Mwinyi's speech had been prominently put in the papers you know which he gave to a conference So oh yes you can't tell me as a linguist analysing you know calmly <name/> wasn't trying to say no move away from this idea of change although we know subsequently of course there was the Zanzibar change okay So perhaps maybe people are going to wish to discuss and my colleague here has agreed to RRRto chip in at the end maybe I will say one more thing about Ali Hassan Mwinyi so that you can see the contrast uh President Mwinyi tends to use involvement markers such as the use of hearer inclusive we the first person  singular><+_plural> pronoun and the use of a greater proportion of verbs than nouns to construct the message chunks His speech style is in perfect accord with the trends towards ideology UUUbearing which seems to have gradually become a distinct characteristic of the political disposition of the Tanzanian government ever since the acute economy crisis of the seventies forced it to accept them and with strictures

My understanding of uh what the <name/> commission has done or has said insofar as civil organisations are concerned There are there is one or two points which I thought are preliminary points which I thought I should make before I go looking at the particular aspects The first one is that I was actually very much impressed uh by the thoroughness of the report which was prepared by this particular commission But after going through the RRRthe book RRRbook one okay I started wondering whether or in that particular in their BBBin theirRRR zeal the commissioners had whether the commissioners in their zeal had not actually exceeded uh their RRRtheir limits which were set out in the terms of reference For instance my impression was that the commissioners actually attempted to either rewrite a history on IIIpoli party on party politics or at least they have given an honest impression or honest <O/> of party politics and I say this particularly as regards the history of CCM I have been educated in here from primary school up to the university level and I remember in primary education and secondary education when it came to teaching us about the history of party politics they usually started with Tanganyika African Association uh In this report I was delighted to find that at least they have gone a step back and looking at African Associations which in other words simply emphasises the fact that the political parties which came to be formed in our country had started or had their beginnings in civil organisations as such African Association was a civil organisation and it answered all the It had all the necessary elements which distinguish it as a civil organisation and it is from this particular organisation African Association that we have uh political parties such as KANU coming into existence It is actually a progenitor to this particular party KANU and also it is a progenitor to the <name/> party of Zanzibar This is something which comes out quite clearly in the report and it shows quite clearly that civil organisations are quite important That is the first thing which impressed me insofar as the historical aspect of this particular report is concerned I The RRRthe second thing which I should make as a preliminary observation is actually a point which comes out in almost all report writings In almost all report writings the people who are set RRRset out to write that particular report after collecting various data collecting data and all that when it comes to writing and the BBB RRR it is very difficult to avoid putting out their views instead of those which were supposed to be uh which were actually given by the people Now in this BBBin thisRRR regard what I'm saying is that what is stated in this particular report is not confined merely to systematisation of the views and points which were given by the people generally but actually I can detect that it reflects the report itself reflects the views which were held by the commissioners Well I'm not saying that this is a bad thing only that I'm saying that here we are where we are supposed to write to systematise I mean the report the whole intention was actually of the commission was simply to systematise the views and opinions of the people concerning whether they want to have one party or multi-party and how to widen democracy in our country but I fear that what has come out is more than that only that in this particular aspect the commissioners may have had held these particular views whether they were actually expressed by the people or not As I have noted that this is not a bad thing only that it is a reflection of what we RRRwe have This is even more prominent in cases of politics that is politicians will not want to put up a suggestion They will normally say that the people say this and that but actually they are the ones who are saying it uh I'm interested in part three of the fourth term of reference which in my uh independent interpretation the report is written in Kiswahili at least the first book uh and the second is written in Kiswahili except for the third which concerns law That one is written in English as usual uh In the first part I'm interested in the fourth term of reference which is discussed in detail in book one This part talked about the purpose of <O/> RRRterm of reference is that the commission was required to suggest ways in which democracy could be increased And also the commission was supposed to RRRto suggest ways in which they could instil either what is known as a political culture or democratic culture in the country irrespective of the form of government BBBthe form of governmentRRR which is meant to be suggested by that particular politic by RRRby the commission In other words the commission was required to give suggestions on how the democracy could be increased Okay they It is an admission that it was novel that democracy was a little bit uh restricted did not not altogether not existing and the commission was required to suggest ways in which this particular democracy could be increased in our country and also the purpose I mean another thing which was supposed to be presented or to be suggested by the commission was actually instilling what I fail to get the proper word but it's either political culture or democratic culture into the society how this is going to be instilled in the society Now it is upon this that the element of civil organisations comes into play It has been noted It has been stated in various parts of this particular report that and actually the my colleagues who have <O/> earlier on that is the day before yesterday have actually stated quite clearly that democracy is not assured by simply having several parties political parties Political parties alone cannot ensure that there is democracy Now in realisation of that particular fact then the commissioners in my understanding of this particular report were required to look into ways of either strengthening or instilling that particular democratic culture into our country That aspect as I have noted earlier on is RRRis asked on page  from page fifteen on of the first book that is part two of their report This report deals with aspects I mean the RRRthe this particular report deals with IIIasp this particular aspect that is of civil organisation s and it is titled again in my interpretation political situation before and after independence Obviously there are some other parts which are discussing this particular element of civil organisations but in the main the historical aspect or the historical part is discussed in this uh BBBin thisRRR particular part that is from page fifteen onwards of the first book The first thing which comes out quite clearly is that the RRRthe report tries to look at three things Okay It tries to answer three basic things That is why when and how these organisations came into being Okay there 's particular civil organisations in plus political organisations came into being and here as I have said they discuss the origins of political parties and they note quite clearly that they had their beginnings in civil organisations I don't think I have to go into the details of what was stated in there but there are some features which are quite important and they come out quite clear in that particular report The first one was that it is the circumstances existing at that particular time for instance in nineteen twenties up to nineteen thirties the economic hardships okay which brought together the people various people who felt the need to establish civil organisations It is the circumstances which were obtaining at the particular time which compelled the people to form civil organisations The second thing which is quite important is the spontaneity of these particular organisations No one came to tell the people that you should form organisations They felt the need They organised themselves and they organised themselves on the lines of that particular need Okay here's a group of people who had a problem a common problem And they thought that if they wanted to resolve that particular problem or at least to mitigate its effects then they had to come together and establish something which will reflect their interests You see Now the element of spontaneity is quite important in the sense that we have organisations which start at the grassroots BBBat the grassrootsRRR level instead of having organisations that started at the top as is quite fashionable right now We have organisations which have started at the top and they're supposed to cater for the needs of the people with definitely uh failure which is quite evident This is the second thing which was is quite important which comes out of that particular historical analysis And then there is a third thing which is also important And this is one is the problem of putting demarcation between the roles objectives aims and goals of civil organisations and political activities I mean it's very difficult to put a very clear demarcation between the aims objectives and goals of civil organisations and political goals Now this had two-fold effect The first one is that it led the governments whatever whether it's colonial or the independent governments to actually try and either control or suppress these civil organisations The lack of demarcation the RRRthe fact that the aims of these civil organisations however they were defined or whatever their aims or goals were meant that in the final analysis they came to be interpreted as political goals The lack of definition or the lack of demarcation between these two definitely meant that these organisations uh were actually a subject of either separation by the governments both the colonial and independent governments or at least </O> try and control them This is something which comes out quite clearly in this particular report Now the colonial government had various had started actually they had simply started and this came to be done even with more efficiency by the independent government and trying to control this they used mainly two ways First by enacting  legislations><+_legislation> passing legislation pieces of legislation which could at least either suppress or control the particular these civil organisations or in cases of Zanzibar for instance there was outright force in eliminating these uh civil organisations The statutes which are discussed in this particular report which were used by the colonial government and later on adopted and modified and even perfected one could say by the uh RRRthe independent government include such  legislations><+_legislation> as trade unions ordinance co-operative ordinance and co-operative various co-operatives acts which were passed by independent governments uh the trade unions' ordinance society's ordinance and the rest I mean there are quite a number of statutes which are discussed by this particular report and they all show one thing that is they either want to suppress the RRRthe RRRthe civil organisations at least if they can be if they cannot be suppressed altogether then they are aimed at being eliminated by RRRby the BBBby theRRR governments in power The reasons why these uh IIIsoc the civil organisations were actually particularly those which had goals which IIItend tended RRRtended to interfere or which had very little demarcation between politics and their RRRtheir objectives was the fact that these political these civil organisations tended to threaten the governments in power an this was something which could not be accepted by these governments and therefore they tended to want to suppress them as I have noted Now there are a number of things which emerged particularly after independence There are a number of trends actually which emerged after independence uh which are quite important and they are IIIdeterm and they are discussed quite at length in this particular report The first one which is quite pervasive in its BBBin itsRRR influence is the doctrine of white supremacy
The fact that the party wanted to assume the powers of discussing all issues or dealing with all issues which arise and all matters which had to be discussed by the people had to be done under the umbrella of the party I believe the this is something which was discussed quite at length by my colleagues the day before yesterday so I won't go into the details of that particular element but it's important to note that it is very difficult and this something which was realised then and it has actually been pointed out quite clearly by the BBBby theRRRreport that one political party or so many political parties cannot effectively represent the interest of various people I'll give just one example uh People in <name/> area are terrorised and actually they are being harassed out of existence by lions but then there are people here in Dar es Salaam mainly and Arusha who say that lions are quite important as a tourist attraction Therefore if one organisation wants to represent the interest of the people of <name/> and at the same time they want to represent the interests of people who are living in Dar es Salaam and who view the lions as uh an important inheritance or heritage which needs to be preserved for the future generation then we'll definitely have problems And secondly the fact that these people are talking about they may be talking about lions that element can also develop into I mean the intention in putting forward their views they will definitely want to put and come up with a policy and once they want to put up the policy then they'll definitely fall in the domain of politics and in that case the difference between the mere aspect of looking at lions will turn into a political issue and the demarcation between a pressure group which wants to either to eliminate lions or to preserve the lions become a political issue and as such each wants to be dominated by the BBBby the<_/> political party That is one thing which comes out quite clearly in this particular report that one political party or even so many political parties cannot represent the interests of so many people who have diverging interests and they want to put them in a different way or to express them in very different ways and manners Now if only one political party or several political parties for that matter want to have a monopoly of this particular business of talking or representing the interests of various groups in the society then uh definitely democracy is being snuffed out The other element which uh is quite responsible which a trend which has been shown which was quite unfavourable to the development of serious or very serious civil organisations is are the policies various policies which are enunciated by the party particularly the policies of what is known as developmentism These are the policies which were enunciated particularly with uh much vigour from nineteen sixty-one up to nineteen sixty-seven Now the policies of developmentism had one effect in that they tried to interfere into almost every sphere Now if these particular policies are coupled with the RRRthe party supremacy then we have the government wanting to put its finger into almost everything uh in such a way the civil organisations are actually snuffed out The other element which uh is quite responsible which a trend which has been shown which was quite unfavourable to the development of serious or very serious civil organisations is are the policies various policies which are enunciated by the party particularly the policies of what is known as developmentism These are the policies which were enunciated particularly with uh much vigour from nineteen sixty-one up to nineteen sixty-seven Now the policies of developmentism had one effect in that they tried to interfere into almost every sphere Now if these particular policies are coupled with the RRRthe party supremacy then we have the government wanting to put its finger into almost everything uh in such a way the civil organisations are actually snuffed out There RRRthere are very good examples here insofar as these policies of developmentism are concerned and this is the relationship between the government and <O/> federation of labour for instance something which is discussed quite at length in part two of this report And also there is relationship between the government the party and the government and <_/>comparatives><+_co-operatives>

Well as professor <name/> mentioned I'm going to talk about uh Zanzibar and particularly the question of ethnicity in the context of the revolution and the aftermath In nineteen sixty-four barely a month after Zanzibar achieved independence from Britain there was a bloody revolution It was one of the first BBBone of the firstRRR coups in Africa of which now we've become very familiar we've become used to it uh In Zanzibar which was a very small country at that time with a population of less than three hundred thousand quite a large number of people were killed between three thousand and thirteen thousand and many others went into exile many onto the mainland and others further afield Now they're scattered all over the world Now this revolution at the time was described as the overthrow of an Arab minority by the African majority and that interpretation has more or less remained It was the interpretation which was picked up immediately in the newspapers and some of the social science uh work which was being done at the time And this is what I would like to deal with uh to what extent the RRRthe Zanzibar revolution was an overthrow merely of a BBBof aRRR racial minority because if the revolution was occurred to solve a racial problem in Zanzibar then it would not have been necessary thirty years later now for us to discuss the revolution because it would have been an aspect of history maybe for the historians to deal with But the problem is that until today some of the fundamental problems of Zanzibar the conflicts internal political conflicts still persist So it must raise a question What did the revolution do What did it try to solve and why do we have IIIconsis persistent problems And my argument would be that the racial conflict was merely a thin veneer over much deeper social problems linked with Zanzibar Most of the analyses of Zanzibar particularly the ones that have taken a racial interpretation start with the last census of Zanzibar which uh gave a racial breakdown of the population of Zanzibar And that census showed that there were seventy-six per cent so-called Africans and I'm putting that in inverted commas I will expect it will become clear why Seventeen per cent were Arabs and seven per cent were Indians and other minorities But it was very obvious to anybody who knows about Zanzibar is that the African majority of seventy-six per cent will not act as a single social and political group So very quickly the people who had begun to adopt a racial interpretation an ethnic interpretation began now to try to see further sub-divisions So then they began to make a distinction between the indigenous Africans who constituted something like fifty-six per cent and the mainland Africans who are something like nineteen per cent And then once you start on an ethnic interpretation we begin to slip even further and among the indigenous Africans you get further sub-divisions into the so-called tribes And I don't need to give you all these details The question is whether these racial pigeon holes which the social scientists are fond of whether they speak of a stable historical reality in the case of Zanzibar And this question comes up particularly if you bear in mind the history of Zanzibar over the previous two thousand years Zanzibar is located as the rest of the East African coast as a IIIperi BBBas anRRR area of interaction between Africa on the one hand and the Indian Ocean on the other hand For two thousand years the two worlds have been meeting along the coast and this is where it makes it difficult to uh RRRto have an ethnic interpretation If you look for example if you just start with the censuses themselves in answering the question whether these racial categories speak of any historical reality you'll find that there is one ethnic group which I did not mention which is the Swahili and everybody knows that Swahili is spoken along the East African coast and there must be people who are RRRare Swahili The census of nineteen twenty-four showed that there were thirty-four thousand Swahilis in Zanzibar The census of nineteen forty-eight showed that they had disappeared from history None at all or a very small number There is another category called the Shirazi These are the people who are considered the indigenous Africans of Zanzibar They numbered twenty-six thousand in nineteen twenty-four increased to forty-one thousand in nineteen thirty-one And yet when we come to nineteen forty-eight they had disappeared from the list I will Unfortunately I wasn't able to make enough copies but if you could just share these around you can see from the graphs how these two ethnic groups commit ethnic hara-kiri as they would say and just disappear The reason why these ethnic categories are not stable is precisely what I said about uh the long history of interaction between different people of different ethnic origins that had been living along the East African coast There has always been a considerable amount of intermarriage among the people themselves People who would uh be considered African by one will be considered Arab by another We even have a category in RRRin Zanzibar they say <ea/><O/> In other words people have to swear that I'm an Arab because otherwise he would not be recognised as an Arab because of the long history of uh intermarriage of adoption of the Swahili culture Most of the Arabs in Zanzibar until the revolution hardly could speak Arabic most of them were Swahili speaking and some of them <O/> as much as major literary figures in Swahili But ethnically they would be considered as people of Arabic origin So there was a lot of intermarriage uh between these various people Uh obviously intermarriage doesn't erase all distinctions There are class distinctions uh distinctions of origin and so on But the brief point is that ethnicity in Zanzibar is not a biological category not something that you can count in terms of the percentage of Arab blood that somebody has It is much more of a sociological dimension There are differences there are distinctions in society These are sometimes expressed in ethnic terms but very often they reflect class relations within the society distinctions of culture and a number of other aspects Now what does origin then Why was ethnic consideration taken to be as important in Zanzibar uh And I think something that this process that I've been describing of interaction between various uh groups that had been going on throughout all its history and particularly in the nineteenth century that when we come to the colonial period there is a certain degree of freezing of these ethnic categories which can be traced to the colonial policies I know this has become sometimes a RRRa clich but it is still nevertheless true that the colonial rulers wherever they could they tried to divide the society into races and various ethnic groups for ease of RRRof government So in the case of uh Zanzibar these were categorised as races and each of these races was given an appropriation of uh labour So in the case of Zanzibar the Arabs were described as landowners the Asians as merchants and the Africans as uh the workers After independence a lot of these colonial categories were questioned throughout Africa and even Zanzibar But for quite a few social scientists they had difficulty accepting this easy RRRaccepting or rather rejecting the easy interpretation of the history of Zanzibar They tried to experiment with other labels like using Marx' categories of class So they said okay races are not uh usable for tribes but uh classes are They are perfectly acceptable So if Arabs are landowners then you are talking about classes But the problem is that race and class do not coincide that all the racial all the ethnic uh boundaries cut across class-lines And again I might <O/> distribute another graph And I'll try now to explain how these different classes emerged not merely just taking as it occurred at the particular time I think basically you can say that the pattern of social differentiation in Zanzibar as I said began to develop during the nineteenth century when Zanzibar developed two sectors of the colony which were very important throughout the history One that it was a centre of trade for the whole of Eastern Africa for various reasons that we don't really need to go But all the trade of Eastern Africa of Kenya Uganda Tanganyika and in parts beyond it was generally through Zanzibar And that gave rise to an important merchant class which monopolised the trade and from which they benefited This merchant class was to start with uh Arab led by the Sultan of Oman at that time Said Said <name/> but it was also joined very early on by the Indians who had come there They joined uh as merchants partly because they did not have an opening into land ownership That I will mention later on So these began to constitute a merchant class from the nineteenth century But what is important here to remember is that although this constituted an important merchant class the whole of the commercial empire that Zanzibar built up in the nineteenth century began to break down with the colonial partition of Africa So the merchant class living in Zanzibar no longer had control over its hinterland over Kenya which became British Tanganyika which became German and so on And therefore the merchant class in Zanzibar began to be impoverished Many of them migrated to the mainland Those who remained in Zanzibar many of the sons had to change their profession from IIImu from trade into civil service become teachers and so on Some of them went into lending money to the landowners But the important thing I want to leave you with is that this merchant class that had developed in the nineteenth century 
So this merchant class began to disintegrate and a large proportion of uh the RRRthe former merchant class had actually been reduced to small shopkeepers civil servants teachers and so on artisans So that was one sector of the economy on which Zanzibar had thrived in the nineteenth century and how the classes had begun to disintegrate The second was the plantation sector During the nineteenth century uh Zanzibar developed as a major plantation area growing cloves the spice cloves for which Zanzibar became famous And that plantation of course economy was based on slave labour coming from the interior of Africa Initially the RRRthe big landowners were Arabs uh particularly Oman Arabs who had come with the Sultan and who were given large parcels of land But cloves like anybody who knows about Zanzibar and the clove economy the clove economy is very unstable uh Production fluctuation very very widely from year to year and the prices accordingly also fluctuate So it RRRit was a very dangerous venture for any land-owning class So even during the nineteenth century the merchant class and the land-owning class was unstable Many of them were getting impoverished To add to these normal problems two events occurred in the eighteen seventies which broke the back of the land-owning class The first was a major hurricane which hit Zanzibar in eighteen seventy-two which wiped out almost the whole of the uh clove plantation area almost the whole of it So all the clove trees had to be replanted Now that hurricane was in eighteen seventy-two In eighteen seventy-three slave trade was abolished so that no fresh supplies of labour could come in Now under these conditions the land-owning class which is already precarious now had problems of dealing with shortage of labour and the problem of replanting And the net result was that they were not able to do it Not all of them were able to do it Many of them were forced to sell part of their land in order to RRRto buy or to get labour to replant Many of them got heavily in debt And in this process of trying to re-establish themselves as uh RRRas clove producers they were forced to apart from selling the land they were also forced to make arrangements with the local peasant population in Zanzibar and the two islands of <name/> and <name/> in order to get labour without having to pay money because they didn't have money

This afternoon we're going to present a seminar on social problems uh There are many social problems in our contemporary societies which in most of the cases are pretty much the same There are causes of these problems as well <Name/> argued these social problems are prevalent because there are ill-mannered lazy and irresponsible people By ill-mannered people he means those individuals who behave or having manners which are not capable or accepted in a particular value consensus of a particular social group Lazy people are those who do things unwillingly or do little work Irresponsible people are those who do things without a proper sense or those who do not do what they are supposed or should do like doing a certain BBBa certainRRR duty or uh caring a thing or person Now in this seminar uh we'll define social problems according to different writers emergence of social problems causes and their social control We'll take truancy poverty homosexuality unemployment and criminality as our case studies Finally we will conclude by insisting that some problems like unemployment and poverty are not necessarily caused by lazy people and for some problems the causes may be uh irresponsible people In this uh question uh yeah we we'll use uh structural functionalist and Marxist approaches uh The social problems as defined by <name/> in his book known as Social Problems nineteen-seventy are those conditions which have a negative impact on individual and social well-being as identified by sociological analysis of the organisation and functioning uh of a RRRa society Another sociologist <name/> in his book Social Problems defines a social problem as a condition which is defined by a considerable number of persons as a deviation from some social norms which they cherish Also according to Encyclopaedia of Social Sciences social problems are described as perplexing questions about human societies proposed for solution So from these definitions we can simply say that a social problem is any condition which affects the majority of the members of society negatively The most common social problems existing in many societies are drug addiction alcoholism criminality poverty teenage pregnancy uh delinquency prostitution marriage and divorce problems mental illness and homosexuality And uh in this particular uh seminar the focus will be on truancy unemployment homosexuality poverty and crime uh Now let's begin with uh the emergence of social problems uh Something only becomes a social problem when people see it as  a> threatening and undesirable For a social problem to emerge there must be people saying that uh something is wrong and that they want it stopped Hence the reaction of the significant group is crucial uh There must be some socially significant groups declaring an action or a condition to be a social problem But also there must be more through institutional support uh for instance church against abortion or mass media to publicise the problem educate the people and making it open to public opinion Without institutional or mass media support a social problem uh may never emerge This can well be uh illustrated by uh smoking Many people believe it is bad and dangerous but they get little institutional or mass media support uh but uh nowadays at least there are some uh uh institutional support and mass media that smoking is uh dangerous You'll find that in many places they write in buses or cars in public places you find uh that smoking is forbidden smoking is not allowed no smoking and so on But as this must occur for something to emerge as a social problem uh a loss of interest and concern can lead to disappearance of social problem For example in North America now with regard to premarital sex where there is little strongly organised criticism among groups with social power or influence Also in some societies social drinking does not become a social problem because many people do it and they do not want to be criticised They have controls placed over their right to drink But the best reason for this is that there is an institutional support Traditionally social drinking is a custom of many tribes in Africa uh Tanzania included but in some it is not and so it is a social problem For example in Zanzibar uh social drinking any alcoholic drinking is undesirable It's not allowed It's not known IIIThere uh Therefore a social problem is uh not IIItrans transferable I mean from one society to another It is only a social problem in a particular social context and another good illustration is the smoking of marijuana It is legal in Jamaica but it's illegal in many other societies However most societies have pretty much the same social problems Now let us see what are the general causes of social problems uh There are some general causes of social problems which differ among various interest social groups and they need to be identified in part First of all deviance By deviance it means any act which goes against the norms and values of a particular society by an individual or corporate members of a group which disregards to flout the norms and values uh This is the major constituent of social problems With society not being blamed the individual is not the only one uh to blame for most social problems uh What has frequently come to be blamed is one institution the family Most people belong to families but the families are not organised collectively anyway So they are easy to criticise and have no means of fighting back The family often gets blamed for such deviant behaviour because apart from reproduction the primary function of this institution is the inheritance of culture uh morals norms and values to the new members of society It is its responsibility to make sure that the uh children do not deviate from the culture They conform to the norms and values of the society We must also confess that family is not the only institution responsible for culture maintenance uh There are other secondary ones like schools and religious institutions Well from the structural and functionalist approach uh when a member of society deviates from the culture this indicates that one of the institutions responsible for shaping the behaviour of the individuals does not operate effectively Hence it is argued sometimes that uh social problems are there because of irresponsible members of society and these are often irresponsible parents and elders Through the socialisation process uh individuals acquire certain uh behaviour Well uh On the other hand it is sometimes argued that uh heredity that is the transmission of physical traits from a parent to IIIurs offspring has been <O/> uh and it is so it is to a certain extent today uh considered uh uh the causative factor in some social problems like crime but this argument is open to doubt because nothing is inherited as a social problem uh It is the socialisation that uh one is brought up with which shapes  his><+_one's> behaviour and this process is not inherited anyway but it is acquired Mass media Mass media has close relationship with the causes of social problems TV can be an indirect cause for instance There is some evidence that IIIvi some viewers engage or imitate some bad behaviour due to the coverage of certain crimes or violence on TV Individual's pathology For some problems the cause may be individual's pathology which means that he or she has frustrations mental illness or hysteria Also another cause of social uh problems is uh social change Both positive and negative social changes may lead to some problems Urbanization or industrialization for example can lead to air pollution and delinquency Also from Marxian perspective it can be argued that division of labour can lead to some members of society having little wealth If the wealth is not distributed proportionally some members will be poor A good illustration is seen in slave and capitalist modes of production The major means of production are owned by the minority slave masters and bourgeoisie respectively Hence the majority of the masses remain poor As a result some members are forced to engage in other ways to support themselves regardless they are accepted or not such as prostitution or robbery Now let us examine uh some uh RRRsome of the social problems and discuss the view that uh there are social problems because there are ill-mannered and uh irresponsible lazy people Poverty It is the condition of those men and women who lack one or more of the essentials of human life It is believed by some people of the middle and upper classes that people are poor because they do not want to work But this contention is debatable It is a misconception Is work a solution of poverty uh Sometimes you may work and have low income or one may have work and have a little income or one may have a job and gain a higher income but uh things are sold expensively a high price for a household to afford more than uh people can afford uh On the other hand poverty is caused or IIIi is linked to many other social problems such as crime and delinquency Hence poverty is not only caused by lazy people but it can be viewed as a long process which should be analysed historically Colonialism including slave trade affected the economies of many African societies The resources were taken including the energetic people to America and Europe The consequences of these changes have led to many social problems like poverty Another social problem is alcoholism Alcoholism may be defined as a condition which arises from excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages World Health Organisation has defined alcoholics as those excessive drinkers whose dependence on alcohol has attained such a degree that they show IIIno noticeable mental and bodily disturbance uh Yes IIIthe their IIIin IIIinter interpersonal relations and their smooth social and economic functioning uh who show the uh <O/> sign of uh such development It is a social problem that leads to crime incurring debts and sometimes alcoholics are responsible for many accidents which occur on our roads Under the influence of alcohol  individual><+_individuals> may become active boisterous aggressive silent or unconscious uh In many African societies alcoholism is not regarded as criminal behaviour or a form of major deviant behaviour since people seem to have a reasonable capacity for alcohol consumption But for some societies consuming any amount of alcohol is deviance from culture and hence uh it is uh a social problem to that particular society Unemployment uh Unemployment is a condition in which capable uh person having the right and willingness to work is unable through no fault of his own to find work commensurate with his ability and reasonable demands It is not only an important social problem for those who can't work but it is also problematic because society must come up with some form of uh support of the unemployed through either welfare or unemployment compensation taken from the taxes of the others More indirect but also important is the fact that unemployment is related to such social problems as crime poverty and family difficulties Unemployment can also be related to problems of health The person who has had serious physical or mental health problems not get a job because of his medical uh history Also unemployment is an  evitable><inevitable> BBBan  evitable><inevitable>RRR consequence of technical change For example in the nineteen thirties in North America thousands of men were hired to dig ditches but that job was made obsolete with the development of digging machines Criminality It is a behaviour that deviates from the norms of a particular community to a degree considered dangerous to the society Some examples of criminality are robbery rape or murder those uh the offences against the prevailing laws of the particular society Most criminals commit offences when there is insufficiency of being capable or to satisfy their needs through the normal channels of their salaries or incomes This may consequently resort to crime to satisfy their appetites Another social problem is truancy uh Truancy means that uh a child runs away from home usually from the countryside to the urban areas This is mainly caused by broken marriages or broken homes By broken homes it means that parents are separated or divorced or one or both parents are dead crowded home  condition><+_conditions> or one or more members of the family are criminalistic immoral or alcoholic This problem is found much more frequently in urban areas A group of youths form uh gang delinquency RRRde uh gang delinquents such as <name/> of Tanzania uh in the street corners Parents or elders are responsible for the supervision of their children Hence IIIirr irresponsibility of the parents for their children results in this form of behaviour Another social problem is homosexuality This is a behaviour which involves sexual relations with members of one's own sex The beliefs about the causes of homosexuality have changed A century ago the causes were attributed to the bad seed of one's ancestors and there was no cure because it is impossible to reverse heredity In  the> contemporary times the causes may be placed in two into two groupings medical and social uh Medical explanation There is a view that homosexuality is a disease or illness and should be regarded as medical problem It is also described that uh it is a manifestation of some sexual abnormality and some disturbed personality development Another explanation is social explanation uh From sociological viewpoint young mammals who have not uh been previously conditioned will react to any sufficient sexual stimuli whether these are IIIautocrat uh autoerotic heteroerotic or homoerotic in character Consequently homosexuality like heterosexuality is learned through one's social experiences with regard to the sex itself The causes of female homosexuality come to be viewed uh sociologically as a project of the total and on-going environment which includes the family peer groups various legal and societive penalties and sanctions and sub-cultural expectations all of which help to shape homosexuality 
Now we have seen uh these social problems as we have discussed Now let us see what is their social control Social control first of all means all collective efforts to ensure conformity to the norms of society so as to prevent deviance by eliminating its causes Its main function is resocialisation of people so that they cease wanting to deviate In many societies the major effort in preventing crime and deviance has been directed towards removing its causes Here the emphasis has been placed on childhood socialisation like social problems social controls differ from one society to another depending on the problem concerned Social control includes also scolding beating ostracism fine imprisonment and even death so as to discourage and penalise the deviants for failing to conform to culture Now I can conclude by saying that social problems can BBBsocial problemsRRR uh those which are in the form of deviant behaviour like crime abortion prostitution homosexuality Also there are social problems which are not in the form of deviance such as unemployment and poverty Some of these problems such as truancy and teenage pregnancy are there because of some irresponsible people and these are parents and elders who look after their children Other problems like poverty and unemployment have to be analysed historically There are more problems now than in the past because socialisation which used to be uh the foremost role of the family was largely taken up by formal education institutions Children are sent to nursery schools as early as four years old As a result the quality of socialisation is different from the close primary and personal relations In addition since the family is no longer the focus of economic activities adult members of the family have IIIve uh very little time to spare for the socialisation of children at home Hence the ill-mannered people exist as a result of the failure of the family and other institutions responsible for cultural maintenance to make them conform to culture of their society Social changes on the other hand cause social problems Such changes can be urbanization or industrialization Also social problems are not caused by lazy people because work is not a straightforward solution to poverty One may have a job and be poor Thank you Now this is the end of my presentation and I welcome any contribution and questions</I>

What are these minority groups which require minority rights and do we have any minority communities in this country The second one probably how far have minority rights been dealt with in international law international convention as well as domestic law and the third question is to what extent did the <name/> report address itself to minority rights in Tanzania and finally I would look at what are the rights of the minorities that require special attention Mr Chairman the concept of minorities is one of those different concepts to define and I dare say so far even in the international fora there is no universally accepted definition of what a minority group or a minority community is and I would say uh whether a given community is a minority or not is not a question of law it is a question of fact Now the nearest definition that I have is the definition given by the international court of justice way back in nineteen thirty when they were giving their opinion on the question or on the dispute between Greek and Bulgarian emigrants and in that opinion which is dated thirty-first of July nineteen thirty the international court of justice said A minority group is a group of persons living in a given country or locality having a race religion language traditions of their own and united by the identity of such race religion language and traditions in a sentiment of solidarity with a view to preserving their traditions maintaining their form of worship securing instruction and upbringing of their children in accordance with the spirit and traditions of their race and mutually assisting one another Now briefly what we see in that definition is that a minority is either an ethnic religious or linguistic or cultural group which is numerically smaller than the rest of the population of the state to which it belongs and which possesses cultural physical or historical characteristics either a religion a language which is different from the rest of the population and it is the difficulties of having a clear-cut concept that has made the question of minority a little bit uh tense and controversial in Africa In fact most of the African countries do not accept that they have what anything called minority communities or minority groups Now in the context of Tanzania my question will be uh do we have minorities and if so which are these minority communities and my question would be have you heard about people called the <name/> <name/> <name/> who in my opinion in my view fall very closely to the definition that is given in this uh international court of justice opinion So it would appear from the definition that in order for there to be a minority in a given state you see the three basic elements are that first RRRfirst that the minority should be a non-dominant group in the population and it should possess a culture a language or a religion which is so specific to itself very much different from the rest of the population and the second characteristic or element would be that the community should be sufficient in number not too small sufficient in number to deserve the preservation of such traditions or characteristics and that that minority should be loyal to the state within which it is living So that sort of definition avoids the question of succession or separation by some communities and so forth Now how far BBBhow farRRR have minority rights been preserved internationally and so forth Formerly this concept and the  conflict><+_conflicts> that has that have arisen about minority groups can be seen much more clearer if we look at the history of Europe from right in the seventeenth century up to to date and we hear we still hear a lot of conflict ethnic conflicts and so forth Now I will not go into the history because it is going to take us extremely long but all that I can say in a summary is that if you look at the seventeenth century you will find that the concept of minority rights was very much used to preserve religious minorities against persecution you see so you'll find throughout Europe the concept is being used by those who belong to minorities in terms of religion to try and preserve their religion and in many cases the concept was also used as a pretext by some countries to invade other countries where they felt that religious minorities were not being given the freedom to worship For RRRfor IIIin RRRfor instance you'll find England intervening in France in RRRin sixteen fifty-five uh Holland intervening in France also to protect the so-called Calvinists and Sweden intervening in Poland in seventeen UUUsixty-seven in order to protect Protestants so-called minorities in terms of religion Now coming to the eighteenth century you'll find that several treaties are being concluded in Europe and the concept of minorities is being broadened not only uh being restricted to religious minorities but also to questions of languages the linguistic minorities uh racial minorities and so forth So a number of treaties are being concluded in Europe You have the Treaty of Vienna in eighteen fifteen between Austria and the Netherlands containing special protection for Belgian Catholic ethnic minorities You have the final act of the Congress of Vienna signed in Vienna in eighteen fifteen by Austria France Britain and Portugal and Russia and Sweden where they are trying to safeguard the interests of national minorities particularly the Poles and the Polish language and you have another convention the Treaty of Berlin in July eighteen seventy-eight between Germany Austria Hungary France and Britain and Italy which abolishes religious discrimination and so forth And the story goes on until you come to the twentieth century You have a lot of treaties and conventions to try to protect minorities So coming to the African continent and particularly in Tanzania the first thing that we can note both in terms of the constitution and domestic laws is that there is no recognition in the internal law of the rights of ethnic and linguistic minorities As you remember I said there are minority communities in Tanzania which require special protection and the argument has been that this is the country of people who are equal there are no language *differentiations> and according to the government we cannot distinguish the people of Tanzania by linguistic groups because there are so many linguistic groups and within the bigger linguistic groups if you say the Sukoma you still have some dialects which RRRwhich differ from one Sukoma area to another so you cannot really define the people of Tanzania in those terms That is the government argument and therefore the question of protecting a minority who happen to be in a different linguistic group does not arise but I don't think whether that is true and I as I did say the question of whether you have minorities is really a question of fact and not RRRnot a question of law Now if we come down to the <name/> report volume two uh where you have the terms of no volume one the terms of <O/> <name/> report which are about seven there is no specific reference giving the commission in the course of its uh deliberations to look or to take into account the rights of minority communities The only BBBthe onlyRRR reference which is very very ambiguous appears in what the <name/> calls <ea_><O/><ea/> which I consider to be guidelines because there is <ea_><O/><ea/> <Ea_><O/><ea/> is probably terms of reference Then there is <ea_></O><ea/> which would be some guidelines presidential guidelines to the commission and if you look at paragraph four sub-item five you see there is some mention there that the commission should try to incorporate the views of minority communities that would be my definition but in Kiswahili it simply says <ea_>sentences<ea/> <Ea/><O/> etcetera would include these linguistic communities Probably members of the commission will tell us to what extent did they consult communities like the <name/> and the <name/> to see whether their interests their special interests have been taken care of by the commission because it is my argument that these people belong to very different cultures to very different linguistic  group><+_groups> and their way of life is very much different from the BBBfrom theRRR rest of the population in Tanzania I will give you examples In nineteen seventy-five during the villages and <name/> villages exercise the government attempted to modernise the UUUSandawe by collecting them in villages establishing schools and teaching them farming And do you know what happened If you go there you'll find schools without children farms without the UUUSandawe and it is all a relic of a disaster because these people are essentially food gatherers and hunters and that is what all that they know about So to try to modernise them by actually destroying their culture is in fact to more contrary to some of the accepted internationally accepted conventions about the protection of minorities And if you look at the constitution BBBif you look at the constitutionRRR in the Bill of Rights
