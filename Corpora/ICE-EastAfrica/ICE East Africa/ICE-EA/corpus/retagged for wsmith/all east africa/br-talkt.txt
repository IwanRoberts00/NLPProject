<$A> Hello and welcome dear listeners to Investment and Trade in Tanzania The Tanzanian Tourist Board TTB has embarked on ambitious project to boost up tourism in the country Besides attracting more tourist to visit our country Tanzania the board  intend><+_intends> to classify or categorise some hotels that cater for tourists This was the message from the managing Director of TTB Mr Credo Sinyangwe to local journalists at the Dar es Salaam International Airport immediately after TTB boss had arrived at airport from Europe The TTB boss had been in Europe for promotion tour In this edition of Investment and Trade programme in Tanzania we'll bring you the first instalment of three  programme><+_programmes> in which Mr Credo Senyagwe outlines the highlight of his tour in Europe
<$B> Fellow Tanzanians it is a pleasure to be back home to this great lovely country of RRRof fantastic people like yourselves When I was abroad I met a number of tour operators wholesalers retailers and so on They were all very excited about Tanzania as the coming new destination Many of them shared a viewpoint that really Tanzania is the best kept secret among the upcoming destinations So we have a lot to offer in terms of our attractions in terms of our culture our wonderful people One thing that became very obvious to me when we were speaking with people starting in Lisbon at the UUUAster Conference they all said they've been here before Then you ask them when They say in the early seventies So something happened between the early seventies and the early nineties Maybe we fell asleep a little bit and now we are waking up So we should wake this sleeping giant to roll again in the world of tourism So the rest of the world can count on us can expect the best that Tanzania is known to be offering We flew around Mount Kilimanjaro this morning It was magnificent Everybody says what a beautiful country you have They talk about Zanzibar our sister country They are very excited about Zanzibar the magical Zanzibar the spice island of Zanzibar the culture of Zanzibar the beaches of Zanzibar They are very very excited They talk of Ngorongoro Crater They talk of the Serengeti They talk of the migration I was in Paris the other day and we visited a museum movie presentation almost in three dimension they showed Serengeti That place has been full since six months ago everyday It's very difficult to get a ticket Its capacity is about seven hundred people so Tanzania is popular abroad The number of things that we feel must be done back at home most of which don't RRRdon't demand or require excessive resources Most of them are legislative Most of them are policy matters I think we should not delay a minute in moving right ahead in removing the obstacles that now face our industry One of them the visa issue the tourist visa issue Many of them said it's very difficult to obtain a tourist visa because you are not all over the world Tanzania is not well represented throughout the world so for many people who want to come to Tanzania it's a struggle I'll give you my own experience Before going to Portugal it demanded director of marketing presence in Nairobi for an interview He came back It demanded one of our tourist officers going back to Nairobi to get the RRRthe stamp the visa stamp so with all that we started saying Mr Mwengua and myself maybe it's not worthwhile going to Portugal So you can imagine somebody who wants to spend a lot of money uh after having worked very hard for many years saved some money wants to come and see our wonderful country I think we can facilitate by removing the tourist visa and if we cannot for whatever reasons that are not known to us here we could require that on arrival When you arrive at Dar es Salaam Airport Kilimanjaro Airport Zanzibar Airport you get your visa right there No questions asked The days of checking for weaponry for spies and so on are really over Most of the world is trying to get together as one country Look at the European Union Even the conservative Sweden has joined in the European Union Look at America Canada Mexico So these are indications that we should learn from others as much as they learn from us You remember the days of <O/> Zambia Zimbabwe they all followed the good example of our BBBof ourRRR father of the nation President Nyerere So now we should also learn from others We shouldn't have our head stuck in the sand as they say We should always research see what are the best strategies to improve our tourism And at the conference we met with Richard Branson He is the chairman and owner of uh Virgin Atlantic Airways We made a special request We invited him to Tanzania We said come and help us develop our tourism As you know uh a very important aspect of tourism is accessibility We've very few planes very few seats per year Now when you have very few seats from very few airlines like Air France KLM Ethiopian Airline and so on you cannot uplift so many people to your country You only have that much capacity So we spoke with Richard Branson specifically We spoke with Intercontinental Hotels I met a colleague of mine from Cornell University uh Mr Roger Kakuu who is now regional vice president of RRRof Intercontinental He was very very uh pleased to hear that we are inviting them back to this region and he said he will do whatever he can to help us I spoke to <name/> a chain of hotels These are people that President Castro himself invited to Cuba and now they have more than three thousand rooms in a matter of two years So we need to continue creating that uh enabling environment facilitate uh a number of investors in hotels in airlines IIIin infrastructure superstructure make it easier for these tourists to come to our country Currently our capacity is only about BBBtwo hundredRRR two hundred thousand tourists a year That is a very small number and that is the number of tourists who come to our country I can tell you today we can handle half a million and I think from the press release you have received there'll be tremendous increase in the number of tourists of this country I mean there is a figure here of forty per cent for the UK market but I can tell you today we had about two hundred thousand tourists last year or year before in ninety-three I think in ninety-four we'll have three hundred thousand and ninety-five four hundred thousand and by ninety-six we IIIshou RRRwe should reach half a million figure Now how can we prepare ourselves for that One we need to encourage the airlines of all kinds all charters whoever wants to come to Tanzania it's open-door open-skies welcome to Tanzania <ea/>Karibu Tanzania from wherever you are We'll make it easy We'll make it enjoyable for you We need to build more hotel rooms We don't have beach hotels in the mainland although we have plenty in Zanzibar So we need to encourage uh investors to come and build more hotels along our beaches We have more than eight hundred kilometres of beach and you only find two hundred or three hundred good hotel rooms That should not be allowed to continue We should immediately relax obstacles encourage investors from all over the world I met a very interesting uh tour operator who already has hotels has charters to Kenya He's called Franco Rosso a company from Italy I met uh Mr Franco Rosso himself his son and daughter They invited me to dinner and said Credo we want to come to Tanzania he said in Italian I said welcome to Tanzania Come to my office Mr Gamba <ea/>Mama <name/> and all the other managers are at your disposal We'll facilitate If we need to see Minister of Lands we'll see him If we need to see uh IPC uh Mr Kahama we'll see him If we need to see uh National Parks we'll see them These are all Tanzanians interested in the economic uh betterment future of our people So we are all as a team in this country So going back to our WTM some of the successes we have had I think we did a better showing there People liked our stand which was half the size of Kenya People were very excited There was tremendous business There were so many tour operators Some of them were not even part of our team They just came and said may we participate So although fourteen of us went but we had about twenty of them who came and said I belong to Tanzania I've a tour company in Tanzania We said but you haven't paid He said I'll pay on the spot so they paid cash there to belong to participate So a good news next year instead of fifty square metres that we had this year we will have two hundred square metres of space That's four hundred per cent of the current space we took We asked them to give us a central position So I would like to say uh uh fellow Tanzanians brothers and sisters we have a good product we have a great country and we have good people tremendous economic potential Let's make the best use of them Let us not allow anyone to obstruct our progress our economic growth I think destiny is in our hands so you have a role to play in informing our public that tourism is good We have a role to play in discussing with uh Minister of Foreign Affairs Home Affairs to relax the tourist visa Minister of IIIla RRRof lands to create zones specific zones which will go hand in hand with a tourism masterplan for the development of tourist resorts or tourist infrastructure superstructure and so on So the good news is I think we are moving right ahead Tanzania Tourist Board would like to officially announce we have reached a cruising speed and cruising height and we have not gone to automatic pilot yet but uh I can say in a few months we can go to automatic pilot So I welcome you on board We are part and parcel of uh our economic development I welcome you IIIo on board I want you to play the best you can the best role you can in informing our people our leaders we would like you to also inform our minister in the treasury that we need the money I give an example Malta a small place in the Mediterranean is going to spend in the UK market alone one million pounds Our budget for the year is about one million dollars So far this year we have not received a cent yet So these are things you need to appeal on our behalf on behalf of this country Please give the funds to TTB to do its job They've given BBBThey've givenRRR us the job We have a mandate We are doing this in the national interest Please don't tie our hands Give us the means Success is not just ours Success is for the country for the people of this country I thank you very much with those few words uh I'll be open to any questions Feel free I'm excited to be with you as always and I look forward to working with you very closely now and in the future thank you very much
<$C> Maybe Can you be a little bit more specific about the uh benefits that this country is going to get from this visit of yours which you have just come back 
<$B> One thing we made abundantly clear to whoever we met is that Tanzania as a country our government and its policy has already accepted tourism as a very important sector very important economic sector We informed them that we are excited we are eager to welcome them back to Tanzania in tourism projects of any kind to work with us in building hotels in bringing more airlines talk of charters of scheduled flights

<$A> Hello listeners welcome again to our quarter hour programme of African development This is a programme which discusses the economic political and cultural development of African countries Also it features the economic development of regional or sub-regional groupings in the continent of Africa Our programme this week looks at the recent history of Sudan and its economic development Stay tuned 
<$B> Sudan is generally a flat featureless plain reflecting the proximity to the surface of the ancient little-disturbed basement rocks of the African continent The democratic Republic of Sudan is a vast country which covers an area of two million five hundred and five thousand eight hundred and thirteen square kilometres and the Nile waters which enter Sudan just south of Ajuba either evaporates or flows three thousand kilometres until they reach Lake <name/> on the Egyptian border Borders surrounding the country are Egypt Libya Ethiopia Chad Central Africa Kenya and Uganda Sudan has a population of over eighteen point nine million people according to UN estimates of nineteen eighty-one The capital of the country is Khartoum 
<$A> According to recent history of Sudan its geographical position between the Mediterranean Middle East and Central Africa has played an important part determining the character and the politics of the country since the Biblical times In almost all the contacts between Sudan and the outside world Egypt has been the most important link and especially since the rise of Islam the dominant one 
<$B> British rule was also extended to Sudan when the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement of eighteen ninety-nine laid the foundations of the new regime in Sudan This agreement was nominally Anglo-Egyptian but was actually a British colonial administration headed by a Governor General in which all military authority was vested Sudan achieved independence in nineteen fifty-five Changes of governments took place with the problem of the southern Sudan which was inherited from the British colonial administration of which a search for a permanent constitution of the country is yet to be found 
<$A> Despite many years of development efforts Sudan remains primarily an agricultural and pastoral country Agriculture contributes forty per cent of the Gross Domestic Product and its <O/> produces over ninety per cent of total exports which also employs about eighty per cent of the economically active population The manufacturing sector is still small and it contributed about six per cent of the Gross Domestic Product in nineteen eighty-one eighty-two Exploration for petroleum has resulted in commercially exploitable finds It was planned that by nineteen eighty-six the country would have exported petroleum thus giving the country hope that some of its crippling problems could be solved However the deteriorating security situation in the south where most of the commercially exploitable deposits of petroleum are located has raised a major question mark over these plans 
<$B> Main cash crops of Sudan are cotton which is the main cash crop and its exports can reach up to seventy per cent of total agricultural exports Others are groundnuts and sorghum The country's dependence on one major export crop especially cotton with wide fluctuations in price and quantity exported has caused political as well as economic instability in the country With such a traditional agricultural sector it is not surprising that Sudan has a low income per head which was estimated by the World Bank to be US dollars four hundred and forty in nineteen eighty-two The average density of population is low and there is no population pressure on the available resources In fact Sudan suffers from shortage of labour particularly during the cotton-picking season The country is large with large unproductive areas
<$A> The availability of water is the governing factor for agriculture in Sudan In most parts of the rain lands of Sudan drinking water for humans and animals is a crucial factor especially before the <O/> season when land is prepared for cultivation and after it during harvest season The cultivable land is estimated to be about eighty-four million hectares and only eight per cent of this land is being utilised in agriculture and about two million hectares are under irrigation using Nile waters To the Nile Waters Agreement of nineteen fifty-nine the distribution of water between Sudan and Egypt was governed by an agreement of nineteen twenty-nine which allocated four thousand million cubic metre of water to Sudan
<$B> Cotton is the most important crop in the Sudan from the economic point of view being the major export chief foreign exchange earner and main generator of income for the country Three main types of cotton are grown The long staple <name/> for the export market the medium staple <name/> and the rain-fed short staples The difference in the cotton is seen in the cotton fibres The main cereal crop is sorghum commonly known as <afr/>duna in Sudan It is the most important staple food and it is mainly grown in the rain lands Excellent harvests during the year nineteen eighty-one and nineteen eighty-two have encouraged the development of sorghum into an increasingly important export crop In nineteen eighty-two sorghum aimed earned the Sudan Sudan pounds one hundred and seven million for its export to Saudi Arabia Wheat is grown mainly as a cash crop but with urbanisation and social developments the consumption of bread made out of wheat flour by the Sudanese people is increasing at the rate of ten per cent annually 
<$A> Products like the groundnuts <O/> rice sugar cane maize are also being produced in Sudan on a reasonable quantity Sudan has an animal wealth which contributes on average about ten per cent of Gross Domestic Product annually In nineteen eighty-three it was estimated that the country had nineteen point six million cattle nineteen point five million sheep twelve point nine million goats and two point five million camels Also production of milk was estimated to be over one million point five metric tonnes and meat was four hundred fifty-one thousand and fifty metric tonnes The share of live animals hides and skins in total export increased by from two per cent in nineteen seventy-five seventy-six to almost <O/> per cent in nineteen eighty-two However this percentage was not expected to increase as the domestic consumption of this commodity continues to increase at a faster rate Also the government restricted the export of animal products in order to satisfy the local market
<$B> As far as the industrial sector was concerned the dealing of cotton encouraged the beginning of industry in Sudan early in the country With the expansion of cotton production the number of ginning factories also increased until the <name/> board alone has the largest ginning enterprise  until><+_under> single management in the world There are twenty-five spinning and textile factories Groundnuts are also partly processed with oil and cake dominating exports Minerals such as copper iron mica and chromite are exported in the crudest form With the exception of soap soft drinks and oil processing industries large industries manufacturing import substitutes started only after nineteen sixty Following the shift of the economy in favour of more mixed economy more of the industries in Sudan were sold to the private sector 
<$A> The private sector has played an important role in the industrial development of the country In the period nineteen sixty sixty-nine the private sector invested Sudan pounds thirty-six point nine million in industry The bulk of the investment has gone into the textiles soap oil-pressing sixteen hundred <O/> industries By the nineteen seventies the role of the private sector had increased The government has encouraged industrialisation by giving generous concessions to infant industries A new encouragement of investment act was introduced at the end of RRRof nineteen eighty repealing the previous investment laws This act offered tax incentives such as <O/> land acquisition customs exemptions and favourable freight and electricity charges 
<$B> Since nineteen seventy-three international companies have shown an increasing interest in exploring for petroleum in the Sudan More than eighty per cent of available concessions were allocated and companies working in the Sudan including Standards Oil began to increase Potential government earnings from petroleum exports were estimated at dollars two hundred million annually in December nineteen eighty-two The oil pipeline between Port Sudan and Khartoum was completed in nineteen seventy-seven It is designed for the transport of motor gasoline gas-oil and kerosene including aviation turbine fuel It has a capacity of six thousand hundred metric tonnes with a length of about eight hundred and fifty kilometres Chrome mining was being developed and a feasibility study into off-shore minerals in the Red Sea showed considerable deposits of iron ore zinc copper and silver and these were to be exploited jointly with Saudi Arabia 
With that item we have come to the end of this week's programme of African development Join us again next week for another edition </I>
S2B023T
<$A> Welcome again to another edition of You and the Environment Today we'll look at the role of local government in environmental conservation and implementing sustainable development in Tanzania Stay tuned It is a known fact that local governments they are playing an important role in implementing many of the activities which aim to improve the living standards of the people But how far local governments have been fully involved in the conservation of the environment This is another important area which needs to be well conserved in order to implement sustainable development in Tanzania Now what is the major role of local government in environmental conservation Before we dwell on what local governments are supposed to do one must first understand why local governments were created as Mr Lawrence Kilimikwo from the Journalists Environmental Association of Tanzania JEAT explains
<$B> In essence local governments were created for two reasons First to enhance democracy at the grass roots level and second to IIIpropl to propel people's participation in identifying discussing planning and implementing matters that affect their local lives In essence local governments were created for that purpose as I have already said The issue is that local the local people face local problems which are different from the other local communities and therefore they need  specifically><+_specific> and local  solution><+_solutions> The creation of a local government is intended to to cater for that particular aspect 
<$A> In this aspect Mr Kilimikwo says local government should know what type of life local people are living because environmental conservation and development are interrelated
<$B> The issue's that these two are so interwoven they are so interlinked that you cannot talk of development without talking about environmental conservation It is through the environment that people are making their own living It is through the environment through It's by destroying or improving the IIIenviro the environment that the community can either develop or underdevelop Now local government what does it entail Local government means that first they have to know what type of life they are leading Are they fishermen Are they UUUheaders Are they agriculturalists or whatever the case It depends what type of life that particular IIIlo local communities are leading If they are farmers then they IIIha RRRthey had to involve the farmers themselves to know what type of farming methods are particularly in IIIsu IIIsus can lead to sustainable environment in their areas because in most these cases it has happened that there are traditional farming practices which have been practised ever since from time immemorial and these were pertinent to that particular time but I see the changes These people are supposed to change over time but now the problem is that the so-called extension officers the IIIca so-called central government whatever the case have been imposing uniform solutions to different problems at different localities We all need to review and that's where the local government comes in because as I have already said different localities have got different problems and that's why you cannot IIIin BBByou cannotRRR pump farming solutions to problems which are affecting fishermen Likewise you cannot pump from the top solutions for problems affecting miners mining communities to people who are dealing with harvesting say honey in forests We need specific problems Their problems are different Their  way><+_ways> of living are different Their cultural <O/> of life are also different So there's that question of sociological looking aspect 
<$A> I think there is inadequate public awareness about environmental issues Mr Jumo Ngasongwa Personal Assistant to the President's Office Economic Affairs says one of the critical  role><+_roles> of local government should be to expand awareness because they are nearer to the people 
<$C> Local governments as institutions are nearer to the people where actually the environment is or where the environmental problems are and therefore they have a very critical role to play in terms one of expanding awareness uh among the communities the people with whom they are living together uh to understand that the environment is a very important aspect in their development 
<$A> Another aspect according to Mr Ngasonga is to mobilise funds for environmental projects
<$C> The local government as institutions have another uh important aspect in that uh they can mobilise resources uh resources which uh they can be utilised in uh implementing uh environmental projects which uh ensure that the environment is conserved uh Of course I do know that uh most local government institutions are constrained by a number of uh problems One manpower two financial resources uh three uh transport facilities But uh if we as a nation RRRwe can mobilise our resources and make these resources available to the districts then they will be undertaking in a very most effective manner those activities which ensure to conserve the environment
<$A> The District Executive Director for Muheza Mr Diwani Omari Mzina says that the possible way to enable local government to fulfil their obligations and thus implement sustainable development is to strengthen the functions at the district level
<$D> I think the local government has a lot to play in sustaining conservation If you take our story in the past I think we had uh by-laws in the district councils which were dealing with preservation of soil uh of water sources and forests but uh when you get to the new system of decentralisation I think most of the by-laws were ignored and nobody cared in fact what was happening I think if that at present we need to conserve uh soil forests and so forth we need to strengthen uh the function at the local government at district level especially the staff their working implements and the by-laws uh creating by-laws which are dealing with conservation and then after initiating the by-laws and when they are already passed you need the machinery for enforcement and a great problem which we are getting now is uh the enforcement machinery You can have the by-law for conservation but you don't have the machinery to make sure that by-laws are being adhered to 
<$A> However Mr Maisala Mbezi District Executive Director for Nachingwea says the role of local government as far as environmental conservation is concerned is great but to enable them work properly the revenue collected from natural resources should be given to local governments
<$E> As we all know local governments cover all the country and in the districts actually it's where we have a great number of the local people who in fact are required or are needed to contribute much in the environmental conservation strategy or policy In doing so uh the local people will contribute much by using their own efforts and the council in its on its side will use some revenue from its own sources to boost the efforts of the people But what is important to be emphasised here is that the revenue collected by the central government from these natural resources some small amount maybe twenty-five per cent or twenty of the whole collection should be given to the local authorities so that this money can be used in this specifically marked effort of making sure that the environmental conservation policy package is a success
<$A> Mr Abdalla Abdi Executive Director for Ileje district supports the idea of setting aside more funds for conservation measures and also suggests that the councils should solicit funds from the international organisations
<$F> I think the government should allocate more funds from the IIIbu budgetary uh allocations Instead of the twenty-five per cent being given it should be raised to twenty-five to fifty per cent and also councils should solicit more funds from donor agencies In Ileje we have DANIDA and the EEC to finance some of these projects for conservation purposes
<$A> Mr Alan Kijavi working with the Ngorongoro conservation area authority also had some few comments to make regarding the role of local government in environmental conservation
<$G> So far as I know most of the conservation efforts which are geared towards environmental protection have been failing in the past few years mainly because we didn't involve the local communities concerned It is now that we have realised that mistake and that we are now trying to tune ourselves to go into those local communities and involve them in the whole process of protecting the environment and in such a way the only way we can work easily with the local communities is to involve the local governments concerned because they are the ones who are working for the people and they are the ones who know the problems of the people and they are the ones who can assist us in implementing the strategies that have been proposed in the national conservation strategy for sustainable development So I think that by working with the local government we will make this whole exercise I mean successful Otherwise if you work in isolation as it has previously been then I'm sure the whole strategy will end up a failure
<$A> But some people are complaining that the goal of local governments in environmental conservation cannot be achieved because of lack of funds Let's hear Mr Kijavi Lupia 
<$H> Well so far as I see it is that the people themselves have to play a role in implementing the national conservation strategy for sustainable development wherever RRRwherever possible
I think that people will contribute using their own initiatives and their own sources of funds while the central government can finance them with more funds to implement some of the major activities but I as I know that people if they are willing to implement the conservation strategy then will be able to mobilise themselves and implement those issues which can be accommodated within their RRRtheir main financial positions and their powers to implement
<$A> On the other hand people believe that local governments can do well in implementing sustainable development if they establish co-ordination that is for example formation of environmental committees in the village government to control and effectively use our natural resources The Biharamulo District Executive Director Mr Herbert Nyamugali supports the idea
<$I> So far environment has been taken for granted Trees are being cut water sources are being spoilt There are <O/> bush fires every dry season and all sorts of destruction But if every village government was held responsible to protect the environment then we think people would be sensitised and would understand their role in the preservation of nature and conserving it So I think it is pertinent to the local governments to have different committees starting at the district level going all the way to the village governments and the formation of village environmental committees which would uh RRRwould uh play the a role of preserving nature by different mechanisms say by having village by-laws and enforcing them so that everybody knows his role in the preservation of nature
<$A> Masasi District has not been very much affected by environmental degradation However the Executive Director of that area Mr Mbwija Tela Malende has something to contribute on the issue of local government
<$J> It's my sincere uh stand that the local governments are very much uh the appropriate authorities to handle this uh soil conservation or whatever to bring about sustainable development because they are the bodies which are very close to the people and they exactly know the problems concerning the conservation problems in the areas and because of that I think they have their RRRtheir role to play uh What local authority will do will of course depend very much on the local conditions which in one way or the other affect soil conservation and things like that uh As for my district I would say right away we don't have very serious uh degradation problems but however there are areas where the authority has to play a part especially uh things like uh bush fires They are quite common RRRcommon in RRRin Masasi District uh There is this problem of shifting agriculture which has been associated with the uh programme of Ondoa Njaa in Masasi in short Onjama and uh in the near future maybe cattle might also bring some  problem><+_problems> However we are already aware of this and we intend to take some uh regional measures as soon as possible
<$A> Some local communities they've already started conservation measures because they know that is part of their responsibilities A good example is Ileye district As Mr Abdalla Abdi confirmed
<$F> We have already started conservation measures RRR in my district and uh particularly in the tree planting and conservation of RRRof what are source areas by damming the rivers and also by constructing water intakes

<$A> Welcome listeners to yet another half hour of Meeting of the Minds In this week's edition we feature World Leprosy Day commemorations Saturday the twenty-eighth nineteen ninety-five the Tanzania Leprosy Association marked the World Leprosy Day by a seminar which was held at the Muhimbili Medical Centre which was officiated by Honourable Zakia Meghji the Minister of Health In her opening remarks Zakia Meghji urged joint efforts towards elimination of leprosy which has ceased to be endemic There are some two point four million sufferers in seventy-nine countries with significant number of cases as Doctor Ipugi the programme manager narrates as he presents the global leprosy situation and the World Health elimination strategy
<$B> Leprosy is a disease with profound causing profound disability and uh deformities and these are the ones which cause it to be feared and to IIIos uh to let the communities to ostracize its uh RRRits victims Now before nineteen eighty when MDT BBBwhen MDTRRR was uh instituted the leprosy was a big problem But now after MDT the treatment which has proved effective cases are going down If we look the first transparency please if we look at the leprosy burden at the current time uh there are about two point two million cases in the world which are spread in seventy-nine endemic countries and their registered prevalency of leprosy is about four per ten thousand population Of RRRof these uh cases most of them are distributed in subtropical out uh IIIsub in the subtropics as you will see in the later transparencies And about six hundred thousand cases are detected each year By nineteen ninety-four it is admitted that there are between two to three million people who are disabled with the leprosy The next the as I said the group of pictures here shows that the most of the cases are below The next one please The BBBthe most of the leprosy patients occur below the uh in the subtropical belt So both in America IIIAf uh Africa Southeast Asia and uh the Western Pacific Uh the next IIIMo most of the BBBof theRRR patients as we said are in the Southeast Asia region as you can see in the transparency there and in Africa for nineteen ninety-four there were only one hundred and thirty-seven two hundred and forty-nine cases The coverage of treatment by MDT which is the most effective treatment for leprosy to date ranges from uh forty-seven per cent to ninety-four The highest uh uh BBBthe highest coverageRRR has been in the Southeast Asia uh in uh the lowest coverages are in Southeast Asia and uh in Europe but uh you see in Africa uh East Mediterranean and the Western Pacific are the ones which achieved much higher coverage UUUnet uh uh coverages The completion of treatment by MDT by that year six IIImi more than six and a half million almost six and a half million people had been treated by MDT which gave a cumulative coverage of ninety-one point seven Now if you look on the case detection which the figures for nineteen ninety-three next show that still Southeast Asia detected much more of the new cases half a million while uh Africa as you can see it was just below forty uh thousand cases So the case detection rate ranges from thirty-five per cent to less than one per cent and as you will see in the WHO uh strategy letter on what they IIIin uh intend you can see that to reach a case detection of uh one per uh one per ten thousand UUUwell some of the countries are much uh below that
Now I would like to look in detail of some of the statistics which are prevalent in Africa In uh in anglophone Africa as you can see we have uh the IIIprev prevalence per ten thousand ranges from uh as low as in Kenya and in South Africa which all have reached the IIIeliminate elimination phase of the WHO which is defined as uh less than one case per ten thousand population or ten cases per hundred thousand population and while other countries like Liberia uh uh uh are still in a much bigger problem And patients on MDT or MDT coverage you can see Tanzania uh South Africa Kenya Ghana Ethiopia and uh we have RRRhave achieved a hundred per cent coverage while others like Liberia is much much lower Now in order to achieve the elimination strategy the WHO set uh World Health Assembly set uh prevalence rate of one per ten thousand and because knowing that leprosy is a disease of patchy distribution which means that the uh number of cases vary from country to country or even within the country And IIIthe therefore the strategy to eliminate leprosy differ from community to community And this is the grouping of the countries in the world which has been made and group one uh which has only one case at this moment it's India and is defined as BBBcase countries with the IIIpop more than a million cases of leprosy while you go down to group five which uh have eliminated leprosy as a public uh problem Now group one to three are the ones where WHO is concentrating its efforts in eliminating leprosy because they have not yet eliminated uh the leprous as a public problem And uh while in the group four which Tanzania belonged in that group are the cases which would eliminate leprosy if the current activities of uh combating  leprous><+_leprosy> are maintained So it's important that we know we are in that group and we have to maintain the current uh situation This grouping is based on both uh BBBboth epidemology that's the number of cases as well as operation issues like coverage of multi-drug therapy Now RRRnow if RRRif you see the next transparency The next transparency shows just in brief the IIInum the names of the countries which are involved in those uh groups and as I said Tanzania is in group four so what we are the WHO is concentrating now is in the top twenty-five countries The next and in those IIIto top twenty-five countries because we're in Africa I wanted just to look more in detail the African countries which are uh involved and in our close south you see Mozambique and that's why you find in Tanzania cases from Mtwara we have much much higher uh cases than the other regions It's because Mozambique is still in UUUthose
This just tries to give again an overview of the whole uh registered cases in nineteen ninety-four So ladies and gentlemen this is the global situation of the  leprous><+_leprosy> situation in the world Now as I said the WHO uh decided to set the target of eliminating leprosy by nineteen uh two thousand in uh the year two thousand because it was found to be quite feasible Especially if efforts to spread MDT are RRRare maintained in all countries and uh we achieve a hundred per cent coverage Now a number of priorities were set which would assure that leprosy is uh eliminated The first one or the first and foremost is the political commitment of the countries which are involved in eliminating leprosy and one of the actions they have to do is to set a plan of action which indicates uh what activities are going to be done to achieve the elimination The actions which have to be taken is first to identify which problems we have That's uh to see the big the size of the problem and where it is concentrated And that's why we look at the registered prevalence of the cases and the absolute numbers as well as the rate Then you have to estimate the prevalence This is a very difficult in leprosy because we RRRwe do not have a good criteria to estimate the number of cases in the community But the annual case detection rate is a very useful measure because those countries which have an established IIIprogra programme would show the numbers which they are detecting each year and with the population you can get the rate or the case detection rate Uh the estimated UUUlisting also is difficult to RRRto ascertain After knowing which size of the problem then you have then you have to ensure that leprosy control services are delivered properly and the MDT coverage which is uh low in some countries has to be improved and because some areas have uh low assessed <O/> I mean the services are not well distributed You must make sure that these are available to all uh people and it depends on the health services you are using like in Tanzania we are using all the health services from the dispensaries to the hostels that's why we have a much wider coverage In some or in the past when the leprosy specialised leprosy hostels were used this was a bit uh difficult Then you have to look at social factors as uh some of our participants are going to RRRto talk about which increase maybe uh stigma or reduce the uh uh RRRthe ability of the patients to come forward should be addressed also the community awareness should be increased so that people come forward for treatment
IIIThe then after the RRRthe following have to be uh ensured to occur so that we eliminate I've mentioned political commitment then we have also to mobilise ressources And this is where the co-operation of the government the non-governmental  organisation><+_organisations> and the donor communities like uh in this case uh in our case the German Leprosy Relief Association is important and then because the uh uh leprosy elimination strategies cannot occur in isolation we must make sure that our health services in general are better organised and consolidated so that we can maintain the current uh uh strategies we use in elimination in controlling leprosy Then the programme the activities in the programme should look at uh the information which they have In the past before the MDT was introduced patients used to be treated for life So the registers were showing cumulative numbers of patients So we have to identify IIIwhi which are really the registered patients We should not count also patients who've been cured but they have disabilities So we have to clean the registers It means remove those who do not require treatment And uh this in countries like Tanzania has been achieved because all our registers now register only new patients and uh each year we count which number of patients we have This will be presented by my colleague BBBmy colleagueRRR in a few moments 
Then after getting our information all countries who are uh looking forwards to eliminating  leprous><+_leprosy> should now ensure that all are being treated with MDT and we must ensure that we have enough drugs to give them And this because they're expensive for countries like uh Tanzania and the other low income countries have again to look to the donor community and uh to make sure that you get the drug Getting the drug in the country might not be a problem The problem might be to distribute it to the patients those who need And therefore the countries should ensure that those drugs really reach the patients As the minister has mentioned in her speech that our health services must ensure that those RRRthose services really reach the people So when we will get the drugs in the store we keep them and uh showing the register that we have the drugs is not enough and we have to listen when patients complain that they don't have drugs look at our system what mistakes we have to rectify to ensure that uh the drugs are there and this is the only thing which will motivate the donor community to continue assisting us Now when you are treating the patients now that is the problem of detection You have to ensure that your patient comes for treatment and completes the treatment He can only complete the treatment if you handle them properly you respect them and explain to them the rationale of the long treatment in these diseases and they should be able to uh RRRto continue coming for treatment And once you have achieved those to two uh number two point two and number two point three then you can aim at improving case detection Because if you improve case detection without ensuring that those which you are going to detect are going to be treated you'll be wasting much of your time Then knowing that leprosy is a disease which is associated with disability we must ensure that uh disabilities are prevented both in uh uh primary prevention and secondary prevention because most of our health personnel health care personnel are of middle and lower cadres We must prepare simplify the guidelines which enable them to detect treat and prevent disabilities particularly nerve damage uh in leprosy patients Then there are activities which have to be initiated which are to support these contra activities The most important is training but uh as others said if you have not yet started training you can start the IIIel implementing while training We do not to start training all the workers and then start implementing And then we must set therefore a system especially for uh things like uh disability care You must know where the patient if he's such a problem will be referred from a dispensary level up to a consultant hospital level like Muhimbili Medical Centre Because our main aim is to rehabilitate these people and to return them to their community we must at this stage initiate counselling of both the patient the family and the communities And these are the activities which IIIshoul cannot be done by the people in the programme alone but when even either uh health workers the media personnel as uh uh the ministers there have told them in the RRRin this gathering they should we should all aim at counselling the families to accept the patients And finally to improve uh case detection it's very important that the community is aware of does not forget the signs of leprosy Because as leprosy goes down people will uh health personnel will start seeing less and less patients and will tend to forget how leprosy is presenting and therefore we should continue to improve the awareness in the community After we have IIImanage we have set the elimination strategy in motion we should evaluate our activities and this includes problem monitoring and evaluation which we are always doing in our control programmes looking at the case detection rate how they're increasing or decreasing and uh how case holding means treatment of the patient completing treatment and cure Cure is uh uh progressing also disability grade if they are increasing or decreasing You will see in a few moments when Doctor Mwengi presents about the situation in our country Then we have to maintain awareness of the disease in the community This uh is WHO elimination target which uh is set from nineteen ninety-three to nineteen ninety-four At the moment in nineteen ninety-four we RRRwe are behind the schedule because the it was planned that it should be reduced to seventy per cent but there were still seventy-nine uh uh seventy-nine countries So those countries which were planning or had planned at that time to eliminate leprosy IIIsh some of them are behind schedule and they are still continuing the RRRthe activities The number of cases should have progressed <O/> that year but as I told you in that uh year there were admitted two point two million cases So we are still uh lagging uh behind MDT coverage is also still behind but uh I hope in the next uh next five years or so we might be able to reach the proposed coverage

<$A> Hello and welcome to another edition of You and the Environment Today we look at a two-day-workshop on sustainable usage of pesticides in Tanzania The workshop was organised by the Journalists' Environmental Association of Tanzania JEAT A two-day-workshop on sustainable usage of pesticides in Tanzania was held in Dar es Salaam from twenty-seventh to twenty-eighth July nineteen ninety-five The idea of organising the workshop has come out after JEAT conducted a study on the use of pesticides in Tanzania and the understanding of people on human health hazards and environmental effects caused by the pesticides The study the case of DDT among other things tries to identify the pesticides commonly used in Tanzania and their risks of misuse and mishandling The workshop analysed the whole issues of pesticide importation formulation and distribution and how it affects the public Part of the report about the study was delivered by JEAT co-ordinator Rose Kalimera 
<$B> No one can ever really calculate all the damage the pesticides cause However a nineteen ninety study by the International Food Policy Research Institute says that the global environmental and public health damages from pesticides' use alone has been estimated at up to one hundred to two hundred billion United States dollars per year This is the equivalent to between five and ten United States dollars in damages for every one dollar of pesticides used In such a situation one would not hesitate to say that the world around us is now infiltrated by silent chemical assassins In just a few decades pesticides have tainted the entire planet carried in rivers rain and fog poisoning the feeding worlds of birds fish and animals contaminating soils polluting oceans killing plants Pesticides are now even destroying the ozone layer in our upper atmosphere Apparently some of the pesticides in use have been banned in many countries but find their way into the Third World DDT and many other pesticides which have been banned are still in use in many countries including Tanzania How do they enter in these countries is an issue we shall be discussing which needs discussing in this workshop The World Health Organisation in one of its reports in nineteen eighty-nine says that many pesticides cause health problems ranging from such long term chronic effects as cancer genetic damage birth defects harm to the immune system kidneys and liver cancer to short term acute effects such as nerve and eye damage nausea and <O/> The report showed the world-wide that world-wide an estimated twenty-five million people in the developing world are poisoned by pesticides every year with more than two hundred and twenty thousand deaths This translates into almost forty-eight  poisoning><+_poisonings> per minute A JEAT study conducted in nineteen ninety-four which will be launched today reveals that Tanzanian governmental position with respect to pesticide choice and use is frightening In nineteen ninety ninety-one the report said almost ten thousand tons of pesticides worth over twenty-two million United States dollars were imported into the country In related development the government has allowed the III establiment establishment of the Moshi Pesticide Manufactures Limited

<$A> In order to eliminate female genital mutilation <ea/>Ndugu Chito Ram suggested that the government should adhere to the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women and the convention on the rights of the child  place><+_places> emphasis on the needs of the girl-child especially those who are mutilated So the booklet by UNICEF assures rights for all a time for action and it says just as the lives of children and women in any society are inexorably linked so too are the human rights We cannot hope to nurture and protect every child until every parent is liberated from the bondage of poverty illiteracy and ignorance and women will not know autonomy and prosperity until we break the vicious cycle of discrimination against girl-children Similarly the human rights of all children and women cannot be separated from efforts to achieve real and lasting development The next generation will not be able to lead societies invent new technologies run businesses or make peace unless they are first cared for and we educate these children Women will not be able to contribute the skills and ideas needed unless they are empowered to think for themselves speak for themselves and act for themselves Conventions alone can do little They are only agreements on paper which can be forgotten or obscured but with the conviction of governments behind them they become powerful instruments for change and there is evidence that the movement for children's and women's rights is now gaining international momentum It bears repeating that ensuring the rights of girl-children and women is not only a matter of justice it is a matter of progress When all children are free to grow and learn without suffering neglect or having to dodge bullets when women can plan their birth work productively and demand equal pay only then will we begin to put the age of poverty disease and war behind us We should not have to rely on international agencies to enforce these rights when it is in the self interest of every government to do so itself Surely this is the time for all nations to end the victimisation of the most innocent and least empowered members of the human family Surely this is the time to give every child and every woman the basic human rights they deserve

<$A> Among topical issues and events of the week Honourable <name/> minister for community development women and children of <name/> television programme RIPOA leprosy control programme in the country gets under way with a philosophical commitment To present the Radio Magazine programme I'm Florian <name/> behind the microphone Stay tuned
A long term research on poverty alleviation RIPOA programme was officiated on Friday tenth February nineteen ninety-five by Honourable <name/> minister for community development women and children at the Kilimanjaro Hotel in Tanzania Room The research on poverty alleviation RIPOA programme is a not for profit NGO registered under the laws of Tanzania on the thirtieth November nineteen ninety four The establishment of RIPOA programme reflects two main concerns One is that poverty issues should not be seen as just another thing for which academics and others can obtain a research funding Poverty and its eradication are among the major global issues of our time Sustainable poverty reduction has been one of Tanzania's major development goals Moreover poverty eradication is bound up with other fundamental development issues including combatting <O/> inequality and the misuse of the earth's natural resources Thus a research on poverty in Tanzania should bring Tanzanian researchers into global networks of concern with all our futures to the extent that poverty in Tanzania can be considered as stemming from international inequalities e g trade regime debt <O/> poverty research should be undertaken within a global framework UUUSICOM current research capacity in Tanzania has been adversely affected by the growing preference among academics for shprt term consultancy work over long term and less well paid research work Thus in spite of the increase in the absolute number of PhD holders both locally and foreign trained and effective research capacity in the country has stagnated No doubt low salaries and the poor working environment help explain this unsatisfactory state of affairs But institutional weaknesses especially institutional failure to exercise great initiative in articulating a coherent and focussed long term research agenda are also to blame These concerns call persuasive for the need to build and strengthen additional local research capacity The establishment of UUUripoa as long term programme is expected to contribute to meeting this need Effective policy making depends to a large extent upon a viability and accessibility of well researched accurate consistent and good quality data To the extent that research is capable of generating such information it helps to enhance capacity and to provide the means for appropriate knowledge The UUUripoa programme is <O/> being sponsored by the Netherlands government Its secretariat is housed in the <name/> building along <name/> Road <name/> area Dar es Salaam Tanzania official launching of the programme was expected to take place at the Kilimanjaro Hotel and it was done on RRR on the tenth February nineteen ninety-five In a later forum the minister for science technology and higher education Honourable Benjamin Mkapa told his Dutch  colleagues><+_colleague> the minister for development cooperation Honourable Jean <name/> immediately after the January nineteen ninety-four workshop of the <name/> in Tanzania Honourable Mkapa wrote to express that I  have><+_am> honoured to open the workshop I decided to sit through it and participate It presented a most unique opportunity to review our concepts of poverty and development to measure our claims of success in poverty alleviation to assess the links between research fund managers and those in both government and the NGO private sector who make development happen We had extensive discussions about areas of priority and their linkage and we had a refreshing recognition of the issue of environment protection and a UUUgender analysis and at the end we were able to build a consensus about and outline a structure for a programme of research into poverty alleviation I feel convinced that we shall be able to put bricks and mortar to that outline in the next few months Earlier on when opening the workshop Honourable Mkapa had he had this to say I take this opportunity to express the government's gratitude to the government to the Netherlands for the offer of fund and research on poverty alleviation in Tanzania This will go a long way towards facilitating the task of addressing the concerns on poverty I have raised Future plans are under way for leprosy control in the country in which problems concerning the matter are being discussed Mr John O'Brian of <name/> leprosy project under the support of International School of Tanzania has been in the country for three and a half years now details the philosophical commitment to community service programme especially the ones carried out in Dar es Salaam 
However future plans on leprosy control in Tanzania mostly in urban centres equally in Coastal region are also under way

<$A> In this edition Minister of Health Zakia Meghji opens a special workshop for journalists which examined best ways of covering health issues of mothers and children by both print and electronic media The workshop coordinated by Anna <name/> was organised by the Tanzanian Media Women Association health unit
<$B> Health must act as a watchdog When we talk of undernutrition environmental degradation industrial waste drugs we must relate it to health Health is a social economic political and a human phenomenon Now mass media is another watchdog Journalists and regular reporters must ensure that information and the right and correct information reaches the public Such information should be well presented so that it can sensitize mobilize and challenge policy makers international agencies health personnel non-governmental organizations women's groups the community and community leaders individuals in the public to take action You can name it all <O/> but it has to challenge to give information to take action on various issues affecting the health of the two groups that is the women and the children Information must also be correct analytical and geared towards effecting things If wrong information is given then it has a negative effect This is because media people have worked very closely with organizations dealing with Aids be it governmental non-governmental or private So the media has played a big role it has educated the people to understand how Aids was caused how it is <O/> how it can be avoided and that's <O/> for Aids If media comes up and says that there is cure for Aids it will mean that all efforts by different organizations will be wasted If media comes up and says <O_><O/> then it will mean that all the exercise that we have done together be it the government the non-governmental organizations and the media it will mean that all is wasted because the people look up to the media and they listen to the media and they can change because of the BBBof theRRR media However in order that correct information is given there is need for ministries and organizations concerned to be ready to give information This is very basic that information must be given Sometimes RRRsometimes some of us leaders were afraid of media When you hear that there is a journalist outside your office you tell the secretary tell them I'm not here you know It is BBBit isRRR wrong I think you know it is very wrong that media people must have information and must have access to information Then only IIIcan they can do their work But if you don't give them information they have to write then they will write any information that they can lay their hands on Now there is a lot of information in the country and outside the country and of which if we can be able to share with the media people then it can mean that this information can be well utilized As I have pointed out earlier development is measured through the position of women As journalists you should use your pens as grenades to portray in a right and meaningful way the status of women and children In Tanzania women and children's health is currently addressed through several policy documents and initiatives These include the National Population Policy March nineteen ninety-two the State Motherhood <O/> for Tanzania the Policy for Women and Children the Situation of Children in Tanzania the National Aids Control Programme Expanded Programme Organization and others Donor agencies for have also played a major role in women and health issues for example UNICEF UNSTA WHO and so on It is important when dealing with women's and children's health to look into all this and also to look at government contributions in terms of the budget And the standard situation in Tanzania is so but what I'm saying is that the budget of health is still low And that is why we RRRwe RRRwe have introduced other measures one of which is this cost sharing because to fill in to try to fill in it won't fill in all the gaps We'll do something but we won't be able to fill in all the gaps Therefore community involvement is very central when we talk of sustainability of programmes And uh I would like to emphasize this question of sustainability as far as health is concerned Sometimes when we talk of sustainability we think in money terms you know We think that there should be you know the budget should be increased there should be more money and therefore we can have sustainable development But we don't think on the question of empowerment And this situation since we are talking of women and children we're talking of empowerment of women If women are given health education they can influence changes in the family For example as far as communicable diseases are concerned example to wash hands to wash your hands for example before eating the use of latrines to educate the youngsters on Aids and so on you know This is what I say I talk of sustainable in health because it will mean that we have less disease and this is part and parcel of the prevention that we are talking about you know Women's picture must be portrayed as reproducers as producers educators home makers and also home nurses They have many roles to play Women through the mass RRRmass media I believe should not be seen to be retrogressive when it comes to highlighting health issues but should be bold enough you should be bold enough to report objectively on issues that have led to bad health of women and children for a long time There are many examples and here I would like to mention only a few For example what is the effect of the RRRthe problem of refugees in Rwanda on women Sometimes people do not understand us you know I was a meeting when IIIUH UUUUHCR <O/> organized a meeting at Kilimanjaro hotel and we said that there are certain things which are UUUbearing to the women When you talk of refugees for example you cannot talk of refugees in totality You have to address also women refugees What are their issues in as far as health is concerned So these are important issues that I believe that the journalists can take up you know and bring up forward in front Effect of aids on health of women We know that apart from women being infected with Aids but we also know that it is women for example who are concerned of taking care of Aids patients It is basic It is true It is women It is all the people all the women who take care of the Aids patients and this is an effect also on the health of the women in this area So let we RRRwe should be able to look at the coins in these different ways The effect of Aids on women and the effect of those people who have Aids but still it is the women who have to take care of the Aids patients What effect it has on the women's health and the children that this woman has to take care of I know that as journalists you have covered a number of health issues and I would like to commend you on that you know You can read it in different papers Daily News Uhuru and others papers and it RRRit is very good that today we have many papers in Tanzania you know and I do hope that this challenge will continue that more and more will be reaching on health issues And I would like to say that as far as Ministry of Health is concerned you know we shall be ready and I will inform my people we shall be ready to remove all the unnecessary bureaucracies and there are certain documents for example you know which are transparent you know We are not saying that transparency means that everything you should have but there are certain documents actually you know you know sometimes they are made confidential they are not supposed to be confidential So some of the documents I would like to say that perhaps you know they should educate the people but sometimes we censor them you know We censor them unnecessarily and when we censor them  unnecessary><+_unnecessarily> it will mean that the journalists and the writers will not be able to get access to information This information which they can use actually to help the government Health is interstructural so when you need I hope when you need information from other ministries because it relates to health then people will forget you know about unnecessary bureaucracy unnecessary red tape unnecessary fear also of the journalists When a journalist is outside your office we start saying I'm not here you know I have been informed that you're a team of selected journalists As a team after this workshop you should be able to work together so that through effective reporting you can help bring about the images of a new and healthy Tanzanian woman For example as media people you need to use your institution to fight against harmful cultural practices such as female circumcision You should be concerned for it is the power of concerned and committed people and their organizations that can bring what needs to be done within the bound of what can be done I would like to repeat that I said that you should be concerned We should be concerned Everybody should be concerned on health because health touches everybody since the time you are born and  since><+_till> the time you die health touches you Therefore you should be concerned for it is the power of concerned and committed people and their organizations that can bring what needs to be done within the bound of what can be done And I know BBBI knowRRR I'm convinced you can do this Through reporting you need to sensitize women and women groups and the society in general so that they can voice their opinion and make demands to the government and international community on the need to improve health services for women and children It is important that reporting and analysing be objective It does not help us if we just say that maternal mortality in Tanzania is high We need to say we need to go further than that and say what has the ministry done on this what's the positive aspects and the negative aspects What has non-governmental organization has done and international agencies done This is only fair And that is why I say that it should be objective And that is why I say that we will be ready to give information It will be unfair for example to write information we got five years ago or four years ago for that matter It should be information present and it should not be information just to sensitize people you know but this information is not correct So what I'm saying is that you know we shall be ready to offer information and I do that this information I do hope that this information will be used correctly for the people for the Tanzanian people as a whole

<$A> Spotlight on Tanzania This is a weekly focus on development issues and strategies in Tanzania This week a look at the role of architects towards improved shelter for the rural and urban poor Stay tuned At the population growth rate of three point three per cent per annum Tanzania will have thirty-five million people by the year two thousand and the urban populations will have more than doubled thus compounding the housing problem This is what the Minister of State for Communications and Works UUUGandram UUUItatiro says He refers to the principal need for having serious efforts aimed at finding solutions for the pressing housing needs not only in Tanzania but generally in the whole African continent In fact <ea/>Ndugu UUUItatiro warns that if solutions were not found to the problem in the near future peace and stability and law and order would be at stake Tanzania for her part has been striving hard since independence to provide not only enough but decent shelter for every Tanzanian but this task as many others would not be accomplished overnight because it entails a number of things to be considered and a lot of human and material resources to be expended Housing is first of all an aspect of development and for any development to be achieved there must be well weighed and adhered to strategies Then according to the government short and long term development plans and strategies the centre of the plans has been and is still in fact the people themselves and how they can put resources into best use Suffice it to quote President Nyerere Development brings freedom provided it is a development of people but people cannot be developed they can only develop themselves For while it is possible for an outsider to build a man's house an outsider cannot give the man pride and self-confidence in himself as a human being Those things a man has to create in himself by his own actions He develops himself by what he does He develops himself by making his own decisions by increasing his understanding of what he's doing and why by increasing his own knowledge and ability and by his own full participation as an equal in the life of the community he lives in Thus for example a man is developing himself when he grows or earns enough to provide decent conditions for himself and his family He's not being developed if someone gives him these things A man is developing himself when he improves his education whatever he learns about He is not being developed if he simply carries out orders from someone better educated then himself without understanding why those orders have been given A man develops himself by joining in free discussion of a new venture and participating in the subsequent decision He's not being developed if he's herded like an animal into the new venture Development to a man can in fact only be effected by that man Development of the people can only be effected by the people End quotes 
With that in mind then it's appropriate to point out that the Government of Tanzania is committed to make the best possible use of the country's manpower and economic resources with a view to accelerate social and economic development the provision of decent shelter not excluded It should be noted that the housing problem in rural areas where the majority of Tanzanians live in traditional houses is not very acute nor is it a serious threat to health but the government's efforts  is><+_are> still to help the rural population build better houses by means of better materials which can be found locally The thrust upon urban housing is to enable lower income groups access to more decent housing and more so on self-help basis This is what the government has been doing especially since the second five-year development plan of nineteen sixty-nine up to nineteen seventy-four and thereafter in the succeeding plan It's already envisaged in the long term plan covering the period between the years nineteen eighty-one up to two thousand that the aim should be to consolidate the potential and ability to implement building works The government will continue rendering its support to the people in the form of advice materials loans and designing to enable them build better and permanent houses The government will also along with parastatals and private companies consolidate plans for building houses for their employees That is the long term strategy of the government towards solving the housing problem in Tanzania but our interest this week is mainly to see how Tanzanian architects contribute towards the task of housing the rural and urban poor We shall consider the role of Tanzanian architects in the context of the umbrella task of African architects on solving housing problems affecting the majority of the people in the continent Perhaps the very objectives of the Architectural Association of Tanzania AAT can serve as a starting point to illustrate not only the importance of architects in a given society like ours but also how such an association best tell us its objectives to suit the basic development needs of Tanzania and certainly Africa also UUUMbeda UUUMuli is the chairman of the Architectural Association of Tanzania whose main objectives include 
<$B> to inform the general public on the existence of the professional association through IIIpross press announcements etcetera Two to make official communications between the government and its board authorities like National Board of Registration of quantity surveyors <O/> quantity surveyors and building constructors and National Construction Council uh and to inform them of the valuable source of professional advice that is available to them through the association Thirdly to establish architectural brotherhood and relationship with other international architectural associations unions and internal related professional boards like Tanzanian Institution of Engineers and the profession centre 
<$A> Those are the principal objectives on which the Architectural Association of Tanzania justifies its existence but our consideration should also be on how organisations like those of architects help governments in a number of areas The Prime Minister <ea/>Ndugu Salem Mohammed Salem who underlines the importance of local architects says they can contribute immensely  in><+_to> the formulation of the recovery policies of not only Tanzania but of other African governments as well mainly by ensuring that the building policies of various countries are formulated to suit concrete conditions However <ea/>Ndugu Salem emphasises that to make architects and what they advise the government sound more effective training must top among their priorities 
<$C> A training of professionals in the architectural field is a prerequisite condition to succeed in our objective towards an effective housing industry In many African states the number of registered architects is far below the national requirements In Tanzania for instance we have about one hundred and thirty registered architects We have to plan for the increasing demand for housing in both urban and rural areas A few numbers of registered architects manifest the need for a consolidated training programme Tanzania has no institution which trains professionals in architecture However the Dar es Salaam art institute offers IIIsem semi-professional training programmes with a view to meeting the national requirements in the construction industry 
<$A> One reason which analysts IIIcon concentrating on the housing situation in Tanzania and other African countries attribute to the not so excellent performance is that of inappropriate technology Minister UUUItatiro harbours the view that most African countries found themselves confronted with expensive and inappropriate architectural designs far beyond the reach of most people and economy in financial terms Thus the problem of housing the poor is compounded With a need for low cost housing which utilised initiative resources and creativity of the individuals and communities there is also the importance of provision of appropriate designs which took into consideration the cultural heritage and aspirations Tanzania therefore needs a break-through in appropriate architectural design and building materials in order to make low cost housing available to the majority of the people To quote the Prime Minister <ea/>Ndugu UUUSalem All over the world professionalism in architecture has mainly been urban centred In Tanzania and Africa in general the relevance of this system has to be reconsidered in the context of the environment where the overwhelming majority of the people live in rural areas 
<$C> These people cannot afford to pay the services of an architect nor can they adopt the specifications and the implied technology The government of Tanzania is taking steps by undertaking programmes to provide land for housing development giving support to institutions dealing with research development and production of local building materials and is also in the process of reviewing the colonial building by-laws All these measures are aimed redressing the above situation The architectural heritage which is not necessarily expensive should form the basis of the architects' solutions to improve rural housing which not only with not only appreciable low cost but also with acceptable social orders relevant to the predominant African extended family model I therefore argue to study and understand various cultures and technologies in our continent when designing for rural settlements As I said earlier most of our people live in the rural areas Most of them have scarce financial resources Nevertheless they need good shelter Acceptably this problem should be solved by the respective governments and architects therefore have to share the responsibility They've also the obligation to assist their governments to develop the rural areas with design solutions which will take into consideration the limited financial resources available We're all aware that there are problems of both quality and quantity in shelter and housing in Africa Most of our urban areas are faced with acute shortage of housing both quantitatively and qualitatively The reasons behind this are quite obvious and to mention but the two main ones are the unregulated rural urban migration and general population growth Shortage of housing in the urban areas  have><+_has> more often than not resulted in the increase of squatter settlements These unplanned settlements have increasingly posed a problem to our governments as it created administrative and financial constraints in trying to improve social amenities such as hospitals schools roads water electricity and sewage 
<$A> Independence  of><+_from> unnecessary foreign influence in all activities of society is an important aim for Tanzania The construction policies of Tanzania stipulate in no uncertain terms that the aim should be to accelerate Tanzanianisation of the design construction and construction material sector Also to work for import substitution both in design construction and manufacture of construction materials inter alia by promoting domestic industries based on local raw materials hence increasing public participation in the design and construction sector Those are the national construction policies which also direct the activities of architects in Tanzania The policies are based on the fact that Tanzania is a poor country and there are enormous needs for development and improvement The problem for the government is to use the limited resources of the country to get maximum development impact The use of appropriate resources and appropriate technology for that matter in the architectural sector need not be emphasised The reasons are concisely clear 
<$C> As we know some of the structures we see in Africa today though they're impressive and appealing are very expensive to construct and certainly also to maintain Architects engineers quantity surveyers planners and developers should therefore concentrate on cost saving designs taking into consideration RRRconsideration our environment and available building materials The expert of maintenance in the building industry plays a very significant role whereas maintenance of a structure is an expected reality it is a duty of architects and other involved teams of consultants to come up with design solution that will keep the maintenance cost to the minimum BBBto the minimumRRR May I also suggest that it should be their duty to draw up comprehensive maintenance schedules to enable developers keep realistic maintenance budgets Another aspect related to maintenance is linked with the necessity of involving local consultants at the earlier stages of designing where foreign consultancy is engaged Local consultants can play a positive role in helping the foreign consultants to come up with a sound design which is both cheap and easy to maintain It would therefore be most desirable that local consultants be fully involved in all foreign consultancy projects At this stage I would like to assure the members of the IIIarch architectural community and the public at large that the government of Tanzania takes seriously the observations and recommendations that are forwarded by the associations through workshops seminars and conferences

<$X> We present Book Review 
<$A> Hello and a please welcome to another programme of book review This week we are reviewing a book titled Gender and Development in Tanzania Past Present and Future The book is compiled by Anna UUUNilea UUUInkia and Teresia UUUMruma It is published by the Women Research and Documentation Project Dar es Salaam and it's reviewed for us as usual by Edwin Semsaba
<$B> This book is a collection of articles that deals with different aspects of life as related to gender in Tanzania The authors also give their recommendations as what should be done to arrest the situation There is a consensus among the writers that a gender imbalance exists and this has not been caused by biological traits but by men in various modes of production that the world has gone through It is the women who are the victims of this imbalance The articles are concerned though not all in a uniform manner with the reasons for the immemorial oppression of women in  the> class and pre-class societies alike The consequences of legislative affairs for the struggle for development in Tanzania and for what ends in the name of what values and ideals could society be inspired to fight against this <O/> inequality today B Koda and Anga Isa in their paper Gender and Relation Concepts state that there are diverse categories occupying the world and do exist in relationships which are sometimes not only contradictory but antagonistic Such relationships within social formations in which people live and of the production relations therein for example the political and economic arrangements specifying who controls which resources and appropriates whose labour output It has already been established that the division of people is based on property ownership and is best identified on the basis of class race gender and age They argue that it has already been established that the respective social imbalances are embedded in given ideologies such as patriarchy capitalism matriarchy apartheid colonialism and even socialism and religion They state that gender is the first category of operation and will probably be the last category of liberation Their assertion is based on the historical nature of all oppressive categories by institutions social systems and communities that include global capitalism all of which have relied on the support of women at different levels including the household In that case and as long as the exploitation of labour by capital continues and male dependency on female roles persists including the burden of biological and social  reproductions><+_reproduction> gender will be the last category of liberation They end their article discussing paradigms that do inform on gender relations The second part deals with research methods with application to gender in which <name/> deals with data collection analysis and interpretation Part Three deals with the social aspects of gender whereby four people have contributed <Name/> in her article Gender Bias in Language shows that there is gender bias in language She sees the implications of these women as serious and far-reaching The inculcation of stereotyped images of women through language and other social institutions begins with childhood and continues until death This has facilitated the absorption of thoughts and beliefs hostile to women to the extent that these are taken as truth by men and women Women themselves constantly use these images to describe other women and themselves This has greatly eroded  in><+_the> self-esteem and confidence of women in general A woman who is constantly interrupted in speech may finally believe that she has nothing to offer and consequently becomes silenced A woman who is constantly reminded that she is a sexual object created for the pleasure of men may decide that the best way to succeed is to serve men's needs and interests She may therefore strive to behave in a manner acceptable to men Language thus serves as a powerful tool in both creating and maintaining the power relations present in society The author  say><+_says> changing language alone to make it more positive towards women may be a difficult task if other areas of inequality remain intact but it is her belief that more gender eqality in social and economic spheres will result in a language that is less hostile to women and create an environment more suitable for equality and change <Name/> Omari Gendered Perceptions The Way We Learn About Them analyses some of the customs and traditions to see how they are being used in the socialisation process to impart and mould certain behaviours and the way of doing things in our society Omari observes that the way human beings learn things and then internalise them to develop some gender relations which become part of our lives leads to gender inequality in our society Among the inequalities he names the bias seen in resource allocation based on sex Women are denied to inherit properties at household level In most African societies women do not inherit land It is conceded that because women are going to be married hence transferred to another social unit it is not proper for them to take with them the land which is considered a family property irrespective of their very significant contribution to agriculture production Richard Mbala in his article Gender in Tanzania Fiction reveals that there is gender bias by writers but not done intentionally Mbala sees that research in this field it is still minimal and recommends more research to be done to avoid generalisation Gregory UUUBaas sees music as very expressive in showing gender relations while UUULouis UUUBuguni has outlined notes on the creative process in gender formative prejudices concepts and perceptions Part Four of the book deals with the economic and political aspects of gender in which Berta <?/Koda argues that there is limited women involvement in politics either as elected or appointed leaders In her article Women Participation in Politics and Public Life in Tanzania she sees the strategy adopted by women of opting work for political change out of the formal male dominated system is not to be taken as alternative but rather as a complementary system She suggests that women's decision making power and control at all levels is essential in the fight for gender equality Women are advised by Rose Shyo in her article Gender and Economics Analysing the Changing Roles of Women Participation in Economic Development to abandon the piecemeal economic project approach which they found themselves in and adopt a long term co-ordinated perspective to planning She recommends that in this time of <ea/>UUUmadiosi women should use the power of their words to bargain for more resources equal opportunities credit facilities and all other necessary <O/> measures now lacking Part Five of the book deals with legal aspects of gender and <name/> in Physical Violence Against Women and the Law in Mainland Tanzania suggests that both legal and extra-legal interventions should operate side by side This is to make effective the bill of rights in the constitution which  lack><+_lacks> clear government policy for law reforms <Name/> in his article Political Rights of Women in Tanzania at Catch Twenty-Two says the challenge facing everyone engaged in the endeavour to procure equal rights for and the exercise thereof by women is to concede and declare publicly the factors likely to limit the success of that endeavour A D UUUKwara in Gender Context in Tanzania's Health Policy addresses itself to the issues of gender in Tanzania's health system It deals also with  the> cost sharing in the context of structural adjustment and its impact on women's health It explores women's situation in society and its implications in the formulation of gender sensitive health policy Among the recommendations UUUKwara puts forward is that if women are to be given their rightful position in the health policy of the country they must mobilise themselves for it Anna UUUNilea UUUInkia in her article The Mass Media: Gender and Development in Tanzania says the mass media plays little role in correcting the awareness concept the female gender is inferior She recommends that the editors and writers of fiction stories designers of advertisements jazz bands and all others  who><+_whose> work is disseminated to the public through mass media have to be sensitized  on><+_to> the implication  on><+_of> their works of art for society's values and attitudes There is also Part Eight that deals with agricultural and technological aspects of gender Part Nine deals with gender aspects of HIV AIDS where Justin Guma discusses the essential decision making in the context of AIDS and sees the need for women in parliament Ellen Boma sees HIV AIDS as an economic and social challenge to women in Tanzania Boma observes that the effect of HIV infection and AIDS on women are more than medical issues They include the fact that women are placed at higher risk of contracting the disease through their social and reproductive roles gender inequality and  none><+_no> empowerment to make decisions on their own sexuality and health AIDS stigmatization is generally higher for women than it is for men For example it is generally assumed that a man who dies from HIV AIDS is not ashamed because he died while on duty <ea><O/> There are no similar statements directed to women In spite of having a higher risk of contracting AIDS most women have limited access to health information that could help them make right decisions about their health A future without gender barriers could not efface the struggle and surely the publication of this book Gender and Development in Tanzania past Present and Future is part of Women Research and Documentation Projects' effort to shift the terrain of struggle negotiation and often compromise from the private realm to the public sphere In this sense the book is addressed in some embarrassment to women as much as to men 
<$A> You have been listening to the programme Book Review Today we reviewed for you a book called Gender and Development in Tanzania Past Present and Future It is compiled by Anna UUUNilea UUUInkia and Teresia UUUMruma The book is published by the Women Research and Documentation Project in Dar es Salaam and was reviewed for us as usual by Edwin Semsaba Until next week same time it's good bye

We present African Development Hello listeners welcome once again to another quarter hour programme of African Development This is a weekly programme in which we highlight the economic activities taking place in one of African countries or any regional or sub-regional groupings in the continent of Africa Emphasis will be based on the economic sector but cultural and political sectors will also be included This week we will look at the economy of the Republic of Seychelles The Republic of Seychelles comprises a scattered archipelago of granitic and coralline islands ranging over some one million square kilometres of the western Indian Ocean The exact number of islands is not known but has been estimated at one hundred and fifteen of which forty-one are granitic and the remainder coralline The group also includes numerous rocks and small caves When independence was achieved in June nineteen seventy-six the Aldabra Islands the Farquhar group and the UUUDesrouches part of the British Indian Ocean territory since nineteen sixty-five were reunited with Seychelles restoring the land area to three hundred and eight square kilometres Including the Aldabra lagoon the country's area is four hundred and fifty-four square kilometres The islands take their name from the Viscount Morrin d'Seychelles controller-general of France in the reign of Louis of France The largest of the group is Mah which was named after former French governor of Mauritius It has an area of about one hundred and forty-eight square kilometres and is approximately twenty-seven kilometres long from north to south Mah lies one thousand eight hundred kilometres east of Mombasa three thousand three hundred kilometres south-west of Bombay and one thousand one hundred kilometres north of Madagascar Victoria the capital of Seychelles and only port of the archipelago is on Mah It is the only town in Seychelles of any size The islanders have a variety of ethnic origins These include African European Indian and Chinese The total population of Seychelles was estimated to be sixty-six thousand two hundred and twenty-nine at mid nineteen eighty-seven The Seychelles archipelago may have been known and visited in the Middle Ages by Arab traders who were sailing to and from ports in East Africa The Amirante group was sighted by Vasco da Gama in fifteen oh two and a first fully documented visit to the archipelago was made by a British East India Company expedition in sixteen oh nine The French first explored the islands in seventeen forty-one claiming possession of them in seventeen fifty-six although leaving them uninhabited until seventeen-seventy when settlers arrived to exploit the islands' abundant resources of tortoise and timber and slavery was introduced In seventeen ninety-four the French garrison surrendered to a British naval force although token French administration continued until eighteen ten The Treaty of Paris of eighteen fourteen finally confirmed the British possession of the Seychelles and Mauritius The two colonies were administered as a single unit until eighteen seventy-two and it was not until nineteen oh three that their full separation was completed and Seychelles became a crown colony At the London constitutional conference in March nineteen seventy there was full agreement on a plan to establish a ministerial system in the Seychelles but the British government rejected the plan for integration with United Kingdom on the precedent of the Isles of Man which was put forward by the leader of the main Seychelles political party the Seychelles Democratic Party SDP Mr James Mankam Despite protests from Mr Mankam who became chief minister in November nineteen seventy the Organisation of African Unity OAU passed numerous resolutions supporting the socialist oriented Seychelles Peoples United Party SPUP which was led by Mr Albert Ren in its stand for complete independence from Britain In March nineteen seventy-five the leaders of the two parties participated in a constitutional conference in London and announced their intention of forming a coalition government as a prelude to independence by June nineteen seventy-six Internal self-government and an interim constitution followed in October after the British government had appointed a commission to investigate the electoral system which SPUP claimed to be unfair Mr Mankam became prime minister in the cabinet in which four of the twelve members were from the SPUP and the legislative assembly was increased from fifteen to twenty-five members by the inclusion of an additional five members who where nominated by each party The constitutional conference resumed in London in January nineteen seventy-nine and resulted in agreement on the principles of an independent constitution which came into effect on twenty-ninth June nineteen seventy-six The legislative assembly was redesignated the national assembly Mr James Mankam became president of the new republic and Mr Albert Ren prime minister In nineteen seventy-seven Mr Mankam was deposed and Mr Ren took over as president The area of cultivable land in Seychelles is very limited about one thousand hectares of a total of fourteen thousand hectares on Mah and the soil is largely is generally poor New land was being opened for the farming on some of the outlying islands which are managed by the islands' development company which is a parastatal body which was established in nineteen-eighty It is now responsible for land on ten islands Seychelles is heavily dependent on imported food which together with drink and tobacco accounts for about eighteen per cent of the total import bill but this proportion was being slowly reduced The government was trying to make the country more self-sufficient in vegetables fruit meat and milk There are a large number of farms four of them owned by the state owned Seychelles Agricultural Development Company SADeC about six hundred and fifty small farms and thousands of small holdings about one half of them were being run by part-time farmers In its attempt to raise food production the government was setting up more state farms and expanding the <name/> farmers trading centre The main exports have traditionally been coconuts especially for copra frozen fish and the cinnamon which was exported as bulk but in nineteen eighty-seven the first year of its production canned <O/> fish became the most significant Minor exports crops included peach oil vanilla tea and limes Since the start of nineteen eighty-three the government has allowed the export of only <O/> copra whose world market price was double that for other grades which were being processed locally into oil and the by-product made into animal food Tea is grown for domestic consumption and there RRRthere is a surplus for export The government was trying to increase output of bananas mangoes and uh avocados Seychelles is now self-sufficient in eggs and poultry and there has been a large increase in the number of pigs although animal feed had to be imported The nineteen eighty-five eighty-nine national development plan included projects for starting a bread fruit plantation for pig feed commercial potato-growing a coconut rehabilitation scheme on Mah and the construction of a coconut desiccation plant The islands' first fruit and vegetable canning plant and an integrated pottery unit started operating in nineteen eighty-two These projects were planned and set up by the parastatal national <name/> industries which have since been incorporated into the Seychelles marketing body A dairy plant was opened at <name/> in nineteen eighty-six Seychelles' economy is heavily dependent on tourism which provides more than seventy per cent of total foreign exchange earnings almost fifty per cent of gross domestic product fifteen per cent of formal employment and a very high proportion of secondary employment In nineteen eighty-three the sector provided more than one third of government revenue It was estimated that over sixty per cent of the gross earnings from tourism leaves the country to pay for imported food and other goods and the tour operators The tourism industry really started after the opening of Mah international airport in nineteen seventy-one In that year there were only three thousand one hundred and seventy-five visitors but the number rose to a record of seventy-eight thousand nine hundred by nineteen seventy-nine On minerals the government of Seychelles in nineteen seventy-seven signed a petroleum exploration agreement which covered an offshore concession area of sixteen thousand square kilometres with a consortium including AMOK of the United States of America which later bought out its partners In nineteen eighty-IIIeigh two AMOK officials signed a new agreement covering five more off-shore wells in addition to those which were already drilled Other concessions were held by Elf Aquitaine of France and Santa F Industries of the United States of America An exploration promotion programme was launched by the government in nineteen eighty-five In nineteen eighty-seven the government signed an agreement  which><+_with> Enterprise Oil Exploration a British company Under the agreement the company gained exclusive rights to explore an offshore area south-east of Mah and to develop any viable fields The Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation had assisted Seychelles in the organisation of seminars to attract the interest of international oil companies and in negotiations with companies and the drafting of contracts Seychelles' gross domestic product in real terms by about sixteen per year between nineteen seventy and nineteen seventy-four and the growth remained at a high level until nineteen eighty This high growth rate was due to the rapid expansion of tourism and of public sector spending The level gross domestic product per head at three thousand two hundred US dollars in nineteen eighty-six was one of the highest in Africa and it placed the Seychelles among the upper middle income countries according to United Nations definitions 
Well with that item dear listeners we wind up  with> this programme of African Development The programme has been produced by the Unit of International Relations Radio Tanzania Dar es Salaam and it was brought to you by UUUPencia UUUMungumi Until we meet again next week for a similar programme all the best

<$A> We present Women's Half Hour Welcome once again to another edition of Women's Half Hour Today we look at the East African post-Dakar Symposium held in Dar es Salaam recently Stay tuned
<$A> The East African post-Dakar Symposium which was held in June in Dar es Salaam involved about forty participants from non-governmental organisations NGOs from Tanzania Kenya and Uganda A similar symposium was held in Entebbe Uganda  in><+_at> the end of March this year The main objective of the symposium was to discuss issues of common interest and more particular on democracy and good governance The symposium was opened by the Minister for Community Development Women Affairs and Children Honourable Anna UUUMakinda Earlier welcoming the Minister TANGO chairperson Mrs Christine UUUInsekela had some few points to raise concerning the symposium and the Beijing conference in general 
<$B> As you might be aware Honourable Minister a lot has taken place since Arusha National Conference in August nineteen ninety-four  of><+_at> which we had  a><+_the> privilege of having you as our guest of honour too and the African Preparatory Conference in November nineteen ninety-four which was held in Dakar A number of participants here attended the East African post-Dakar Symposium that was organised by Uganda and held at Entebbe in March nineteen RRRninety ninety-five At national level the preparations were going on with holding of the post-Dakar National Symposium at <name/> hotel in Kibaha in the Coast Region this year During this time the completion of registration for participation in Beijing was finalised Some members also had the advantage of attending other preparatory workshops seminars and conferences Honourable Minister briefly the purpose of this symposium is to reflect on the East African post-Dakar Symposium In that symposium the NGOs from East Africa shared the national preparatory process and also their varied experiences of the Dakar preparatory conference The other task of the Entebbe symposium was to chart out ways of working together as the East African sub-region The outcome of this symposium is the proposed one-day East African workshop in Beijing China We hope that will take place As most of the participants who attended the Entebbe symposium will recall it was agreed that the theme of the East African workshop is economic empowerment women and democratisation process These form the major areas of concern on the African Platform for Action From the programme I note that at this symposium more workshops on the theme will be conducted I hope the experience and further suggestions from the participants will enrich the workshops ready for Beijing 
<$A> Mrs UUUInsekela now talks a little about East African NGOs' co-operation 
<$B> I believe that the initial process has been set I call on more commitment so that this momentum is not lost with the RRRwith RRRthe Beijing uh conference It is anticipated that after Beijing a number of initiatives will evolve to co-operate and share experiences in the implementation of the three themes of the Global Platform for Action namely equality development and peace The space and setting that has been created by the World Conference should not be allowed to waste away Honourable Minister We appreciate the co-operation that exists between your ministry and TANGO This is evidenced by the commitment of the government to sponsor three participants and also to reserve ten places in the government delegation for NGOs at the Beijing conference We hope this goodwill will continue
<$A> The Minister for Community Development Women Affairs and Children Honourable UUUMakinda who officially opened the symposium commended the East African women for having resolved to plan and share activities of implementation of the critical areas of concern for Africa Then she continues 
<$C> Although the sub-regions planned their work throughout their areas of concern and although we are all aware of the fact that the liberation of women is far from being achieved globally we women in this sub-region of Africa must join forces and confront our concerns faster than has ever been the case before You rightly noted that there is need to work on culture family and socialisation The new <O/> that can bring change to some of the cultural issues that lie at the base of  women><+_women's> issues and concerns equality legal rights economic empowerment and participation in the peace process for the sub-region are also areas you have proposed at prior time I must commend you highly for coming up with this package How can you talk of equality without legal rights economic empowerment Who among this gathering is not aware of the effects of war and the necessity of peace These are all very important issues as far as our liberation is concerned We have to give them a lot of thought and practical solutions Madam chairperson at this juncture let me share with you some of my views on your main theme for discussion during these three days I'm told that you are going to deliberate on  women><+_women's> participation in democratisation good governance and the electoral system in East Africa and you will also have time to look at poverty reduction and economic empowerment for women I'm asking you because there's talk of poverty reduction not alleviation Kenya and Uganda have had a RRRa RRRa taste of multi-party elections Tanzania is in the process of entering into multi-party elections We all believe that all these elections are democratic but sufficient suffice it to say that democracy is a system of values and ethical principles or a system of rules and behaviour patterns that define and shape interpersonal relations These systems of values <O/> principles and system of rules and behaviour regulation political economic and social behaviour of a given society Even if our governments become democratic through multi-partyism election how do we as women share the democratic process and decision making without participation How can women ensure democracy and good governance as the order of the day Do women know and understand their role How much have we as women NGOs concerned ourselves with educating our fellow women on the whole process of voting and elections Does educating the RRRthe electorate end with voting What lessons can our sisters in Uganda and Kenya offer us in Tanzania and more important what can East Africa offer to the rest of the world If we want to be an example deliberate efforts must be deployed to RRRto raise the awareness of all women in the process of elections assuming responsibilities and demanding their rights and let us prove that the hand that rocks the  candle><+_cradle> moves the world Women must ensure that they have control over the people who take office to institute democracy and good governance The time to do so is now and not later particularly you in Tanzania There is no time to complain  over><+_about> oppression discrimination at places of work complaining  over><+_about> the effects of war if we do not give the issue of democracy elections and good IIIgovern IIIgover governance deeper and constructive implementation It is my sincere hope that you will continue to exchange stimulating and enriching ideas to further <O/> your alliance of operations on these issues to enhance the participation of women in the IIIdemocratis in the democratisation process and good governance Above all women should learn to love one another and be united for the common cause Most of the time women themselves are the number one enemy of one of RRRof women's IIIliberal liberation There are many examples to this effect Women are the majority in all these countries How come we cannot elect the few women who stand to be elected Educating women voters is one thing but deliberately voting for our women candidates is another This is where women defeat ourselves Men know about this We have the we have to mentally liberate ourselves and love one another more than what is happening now 
<$A> Turning to the issue of poverty reduction and economic empowerment Honourable UUUMakinda had this to say 
<$C> I purposely wanted to use the poverty reduction because in the summit on social RRRsocial RRRsocial summit they we hardly agreed on definition If we call ourselves alleviating we shall be meandering around not knowing what we are trying to alleviate but we must reduce it with  the> time we have to reduce poverty among women It has been said that IIIprosperi *prosperate> societies find it difficult to IIIreal to really bring change because prosperity is a great promoter of selfishness The concept of sharing is not willingly embraced by prosperous societies The globalisation of world politics means that the richer are getting richer and the poorer are RRRare forced to survive on the even shrinking resources It is also said that poverty is generally not an isolated problem nor is it caused by the poor On the contrary it is rooted within the system If this is so and I do believe it is then the question's how can women NGOs penetrate their government's structures to bring to notice that changes should be effected for the betterment of women's economic ability in the sub-region Madam chairperson the subject of poverty reduction is very wide and within this short settlement one cannot be able to cover it extensively Here in our country we are developing a package on poverty reduction not necessarily for women alone because if we think that we should just concentrate on women while she's serving a family of a big family including the relatives then you find that we are not even helping this woman we are just oppressing her So poverty reduction should be an issue of the family an issue of the society Of course if we achieve then the women are the ones who are going to benefit most Therefore as I said before I don't like to pre-empt you on what is happening here but it is a target that we have to fight poverty With the poverty we have learned that women are not going to school When there are five children and RRRand IIIthr two of them are women and are girls and two of them are boys the boys will go to school the girls will not Women now are dying even more because they cannot pay for their for health facilities They are dying even more because they have to work very hard to get nothing So we feel that unless we solve the issue of poverty maybe most of the themes we are stressing may be very difficult to implement When women continue to be marginalised and when women are forced to struggle for basic needs in order to survive at times through commercialising their bodies one has to be honest will these women find time to participate in the BBBin theRRR whole process of democratisation Is multi-partyism and democratic process coupled with the structure adjustment programmes and IDF conditions sufficient or do we as women need to look further and form women's IIIper perspectives and give our viewstand and take part in the whole process I know I've asked more questions than given views but I believe in trying to raise these questions and share our opinions and strategies this meeting will come up with the <O/> that can lead to viable solutions Let us not only look forward to going to Beijing let us go there with a method for poverty reduction and economic empowerment of women And in some government meetings we have a tendency of defending our status as countries I hope the NGOs will not fall in that problem We have to be open and be united as East African You're here because we have so many things in common with all of us so let us not defend any system which is not operating efficiently Let us talk and put our themes open 
<$A> After the symposium was officially opened each country presented a brief report about the process of the preparations for the Beijing conference TANGO <O/> chairperson UUUShilban UUUKasim analyses the activities taken in Tanzania 
<$D> Since the last donors' conference by RRRby TANGO in November IIIninety nineteen ninety-four the following activities have taken place I believe I don't have to dwell too much on the organisation and facilitation for Dakar We had a number of pre-Dakar uh seminars One was held in collaboration with the government and the other was held by the uh RRRthe NGO TANGO We were BBBwe wereRRR able to send thirty-seven NGO delegates to Dakar and some of us participated as government delegates  in><+_at> that meeting

<I> <$A> Hello listeners Welcome again to our weekly quarter-hour-programme of African development In this programme we feature economic activities taking place in African countries or any regional or sub-regional groupings in the continent to Africa Emphasis will be based in the economic sector but culture and political sectors will also be included This week we shall have a look at the economy of Zambia
<$B> Zambia formerly the British colonial territory of Northern Rhodesia gained its independence on the twenty-fourth of October nineteen sixty-four It has a population of six point eight million occupying an elevated plateau country in south-central Africa It has an area of seven hundred and fifty-two thousand six hundred and fourteen square kilometres Zambia is a land-locked state and shares a boundary with no fewer than eight other countries It is surrounded by Angola Zaire Tanzania Malawi Mozambique Zimbabwe Botswana and Namibia Seventy per cent of its population lives in the rural areas Zambia has more than seventy tribes the major ones being Bemba Nyanja Tonga Lozi Lunda and Livale The capital of the country is Lusaka
<$A> The landscape of Zambia is dominated by the even skylines of uplifted plantation surfaces About four fifths of the country is covered by Savannah woodland of semi-evergreen trees Highest elevations are reached on the Nika Plateau on the Malawi border with a height of two thousand one hundred and sixty-four metres where uplift associated with the East-African Rift system is at maximum Elevation declines westward where the country extends into the vast Kalahari Basin This  lie><+_lies> in an ancient arm of the East-African rift system but the rifting which formed Lake Tanganyika and Lake Mweru through on the country's northern border is of more recent age
<$B> The recent history of Zambia shows that it came into existence on the twenty-fourth of October nineteen sixty-four when independence was granted by the British was granted to the British Protectorate of Northern Rhodesia This had been administered by the Colonial Office since nineteen twenty-four Before that the territory had been administered for a quarter of a century by the British South Africa Company The main impetus of British intrusion north of the Zambesi came from Cecil Rhodes a South African millionaire Rhodes wanted to see the High Plateau of Central and Eastern Africa under British rule settlement He also wanted to earn next to his personal mining empire the copper deposits of Katanga and gold deposits between Limpopo and Zambesi The British government concerned as it was with maintaining British supremacy at the Cape was anxious to prevent the Boers Portuguese or Germans from creating hostile alliances further north Thus in eighteen eighty-nine it granted a charter to Rhodes' newly formed British South Africa Company giving it powers to make treaties and conduct administration north of the Limpopo In eighteen eighty-nine the British South Africa Company occupied the eastern part of what became Southern Rhodesia south of the Zambesi and meanwhile it had obtained treaties and concessions from various African chiefs north of the Zambesi Rhodes' agents were unsuccessful in Katanga which fell instead to King Leopold the Second of Belgium but the agreements elsewhere saved most of what became Northern Rhodesia now known as Zambia The first president on achieving independence was Dr Kenneth Kaunda leader of the UNIP party
<$A> For the first six years after independence in October nineteen sixty-four the Zambian economy was one of the richest and fastest growing of Sub-Saharan Africa Gross domestic product in nineteen sixty-five prices increased by an estimated thirteen per cent per annum from nineteen sixty-four to nineteen sixty-nine the result of annual expansion in real output of five point five per cent to six per cent and an improvement in the terms of trade due to higher copper prices of seven per cent annually for the next five years From nineteen seventy the picture was more mixed with wide fluctuations in national income at constant prices which rose moderately until mid nineteen seventies and than fell more sharply By nineteen eighty-two the capital output gross domestic product was estimated at about US dollars six hundred in real terms some twenty-three per cent below the level of ten years earlier From nineteen seventy-four to nineteen eighty real gross domestic product was halved From nineteen seventy-five to nineteen eighty estimated private consumption per head declined in real terms by one third expenditure on government services per head by nearly one quarter and the government capital government expenditure per head by nearly two thirds The result by nineteen eighty was an economy in disarray with severe shortage of foreign exchange periodic shortages of basic goods including foodstuffs
<$B> The decline of the economy of Zambia was a result of IIIres recession on the price and demand of copper in the world Zambia has had only limited success in expanding a programme on agriculture and industrial output in order to diversify the economy In nineteen seventy-five the president of Zambia called for a major change of strategy including a programme of rural reconstruction As a result the rural sector's performance in nineteen seventy-six and nineteen seventy-seven was relatively IIIco good with the production of maize which is Zambia's staple food reaching record levels Also in the harvest of nineteen eighty nineteen eighty-one there was a bumper season for maize and other crops such as millet and sorghum
<$A> The industrial sector production since nineteen seventy-four has remained in dismay state Prices for copper and cobalt in nineteen eighty-two were fifty per cent lower than ten years earlier But in the first quarter of nineteen eighty-three they showed sharp upward trend If higher prices were maintained and if Zambia was able to *re-shed> its foreign debts the country would have been able to start pulling out of its dire financial crisis by nineteen eighty-three provided that the government's austerity measures introduced at the of start nineteen eighty-three were continued
<$B> Metal mining is the country's most important economic activity providing about ninety-five per cent of foreign exchange earnings and sixteen per cent to eighteen per cent of gross domestic product Owing to the continuing predominance of the copper industry and grossly inadequate level of rural development the Zambian economy has an extremely dualistic structure characterised by large disparity of income and living standards between mining and other workers between high level personnel including expatriates and most other Zambians and between persons on the line of rail and those scattered in other parts of the country Agriculture accounted for only about eleven per cent of the gross domestic product in nineteen eighty-two of which subsistence output contributed about two thirds and the commercial sector about one third of which about one half came from European-owned farms The share of manufacturing output has greatly increased from under six per cent in nineteen sixty-four to eleven per cent of gross domestic product in nineteen eighty-two
<$A> Zambian agriculture is split into three sectors Production by a few hundred large commercial farmers mainly expatriates who in RRRin nineteen seventy-nine produced about half of the total marketed agricultural output a growing number of small scale Zambian farmers and a mass of traditional farmers who are scattered throughout the country producing at low levels of productivity and selling little to the market Crops grown in Zambia are maize wheat and tobacco Other crops are cotton soya beans sunflower sugarcane and rice They also keep cattle They import food to supplement local production but there is a large-scale production of wheat and expansion of sugarcane plantations The chief cash crops are maize groundnuts and tobacco Zambia's economy is totally  dependable><+_dependent> on the mineral sector as it contributes ninety per cent of its foreign exchange earnings
<$B> Zambia gained independence in October nineteen sixty-five from the United Kingdom Later it became a republic and a party state with Dr Kenneth Kaunda as its first president Despite his long defence of the one party system in the end he agreed to political IIIplural pluralism Mr Frederick Chiluba took over from Dr Kenneth Kaunda who was one of the most influential leaders in this continent of Africa 
<$A> President Frederick Chiluba was born in Kitwe on the thirtieth of April nineteen forty-three He completed his upper primary school in nineteen fifty-eight at Johnson Falls in Luapula province before entering junior secondary school at <name/> in the same province He started trade union career in nineteen IIIse sixty-seven His most influential position in trade unionism was that of President of the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions He held that position to the day he was elected President of the Republic of Zambia 
<$B> On the international scenario Zambia is a member of the Commonwealth the United Nations and the non-aligned movement It is also a member of the Organisation of African Unity OAU PTA SADC and the Frontline States
<$A> Dear listeners we have come to the end of this week's programme of African Development In summary we have looked at the economic activities in the Republic of Zambia Join us next week for another programme of African development 
S2B032T
<$A> Welcome dear listeners to our programme Investment and Trade in Tanzania Our programme today is about the financial system in Tanzania On behalf of <name/> I'm Ernest Ndunguru saying welcome and be with us up to the end
<$B> The banking system in Tanzania consists uh primarily of the Bank of Tanzania which is uh the central bank currently with uh branches in five major cities of Mwanza Mbeya Arusha Zanzibar Dar es Salaam and twelve other institutions These include three commercial banks three development banks two savings institutions two insurance companies the National Provident Fund NPF and one higher purchase company UUUKaratha The National Bank of Commerce and the Co-operative and Rural Development Bank are the commercial banks operating in mainland Tanzania while the People's Bank of Zanzibar provides the banking services in Zanzibar and the number of commercial has increased to some extent since the government has decided to permit private investors to invest in the financial sector Today we have uh private banks like the UUUStanbic Bank the Standard Chartered Bank and the <name/> Bank All of them are performing the same activities as other commercial banks do The National Bank of uh Commerce NBC provides a complete range of commercial banking services through its head office and national wide branch and agency network It has overseas uh correspondent banks to facilitate its international banking operations The National Bank of Commerce provides overdrafts to finance working capital for all sectors of the economy 
<$C> As the major source of short-term fund National Bank of Commerce NBC is involved in almost all significant sectors of economic activity It has a subsidiary the UUUKaratha Company which gives loans to purchase vehicles tractors small items of machinery and household durable goods The Co-operative and Rural Development Bank CRDB also provides commercial banking services and has a regional network of branches The Tanzania Investment Bank TIB grants medium and long-term loans to economically sound and technically feasible projects in the key industrial and agricultural sector of the economy It undertakes the preparation of feasibility studies and project appraisals and provides advice to investors It also administers special funds for financial small scale projects and provides technical assistance and advice Other financial  institution><+_institutions>  includes><+_include> Commonwealth Development Corperation or CDC which is under the British Statutory Organisation operates mainly in developing countries and actively in Tanzania's Development It invests in the productive projects covering basic development agriculture and processing as well as industrial and commerce This one provides medium and long-term financing through loans or equity in joint ventures with government development agencies financial institutions and the private sector And Tanganyika Development Finance Company Limited TDFL promotes viable companies in industrial agricultural tourist and other undertakings based on the utilisation of natural resources and attraction or  sellings><+_selling> of foreign exchange 
<$B> The National Insurance Corperation of Tanzania Limited NIC provides a comprehensive range of insurance services including life general insurance It has a good network of branches and agencies throughout the country Zanzibar Insurance Corporation ZIC provides  a> similar insurance services in the isles Another financial institution is the Post Office Savings Bank POSB with a network of more than one seventy-seven branches and more than one five five agencies seeks to mobilise savings and uh fixed deposits In terms of government uh efforts to improve financial and banking services and provide enabling and favourable banking environment for international and local investors two recent developments are of particular significance A presidential commission of inquiry into the monetary under banking system which uh reported in nineteen ninety made wide-ranging recommendations to rationalise and IIIrestru restructure financial and banking services in Tanzania with uh special reference to the necessity of bringing in private sector banking In October nineteen ninety-one the Bank of Tanzania finalised guidelines for licensing of banks and financial institutions in the country and shortly afterwards it released a policy for registration of new and existing banks and financial institutions
<$C> Exchange control is used as a mechanism to mobilise foreign exchange resources through various channels and to distribute them to different sectors of the economy according to the prevailing priorities Exchange control is controlled by the Bank of Tanzania All transactions that have international financial implications are governed by exchange control and regulated as the purchase and sale of foreign exchange and the maintenance of balances of foreign sectors by authorised dealers Payments to and from Tanzania rates of exchange procedures for paying for imports and foreign travel procedures for realisation of export IIIpro proceeds  employments><+_employment> of expatriates and export and import of currencies notes and coins and others include acceptance of  currence><+_currency> by non-banking institutions foreign investment in Tanzania loans and credits to non-residents acquisition holding and disposal of foreign  currence><+_currency> assets and the maintenance of non-resident and blocked accounts

<$A> We present Women's Half Hour Welcome once again to another edition of Women's Half Hour Today we bring you a discussion derived from the paper presented by Dr <name/> of the University of Dar es Salaam on the preponderance of women victims in Sukoma witch killings at a two-day national seminar on achievements in constraints of women in the past twenty years held in Dar es Salaam recently The seminar was organized by the Institute of Development Studies  Women><+_Women's> Study Group of the University of Dar es Salaam Witchcraft according to Dr UUUMesack is the socially constructed reality which baffles many states ruining lives in Africa It is known to be a critical factor in state societal <O/> in many African countries with consequential antagonisms between the individuals groups and law It presents paradoxes and dilemmas It has been established that witchcraft blocks progress Law which believes in practices may in turn be generated by certain types of development Bearing in mind the widespread nature of witchcraft in Tanzania Dr UUUMesack in his paper proposed to look at witch killings specifically in the Sukoma area where murder of old women are taking place But why women
<$B> It has been customary to generalize that victims of the witch killings are mostly the stereotypical and eye red-eyed old women From my researches I have come to realize that it is not easy to provide any single circumspect explanation of this attitude It is not only because of the age of women which is said to be as old as <O_> <O/> and has been very prevalent in many different kinds of social systems including as I have pointed out medieval Europe In the Sukoma however there are no high level vested interests involved as was the case in Europe in witch craze That is witch killings are not sanctioned by the powers that be It's a local phenomenon Sukoma witches as elsewhere have certain attributes They are said typical to be old eccentric and given to unsocial  behaviours><+_behaviour> scolding cursing irritability and the like They are thought to be especially charactered by their red eyes 
<$A> One point perhaps worth mentioning is the fact that many Sukoma women have red eyes because of continuous use of cow dung as fuel of cooking and it is conceivable that this may contribute if only imaginary to their particular victimization in this context 
<$B> It should be borne in mind that not all women victims are red-eyed There are cases of women being killed on account of their success in business in life in general witchcraft being used only as a camouflage to conceal the real reasons A more powerful effect in the Sukoma case may be the structural imbalance between men and women in the social system with accusations being some sort of expression of the subordinated status of women Sukoma's socialisation stresses the fact that women are inherently prone to witchcraft and this has been authenticated by other researchers as well and also by I mean I have recent tests from one of my researchers who just come from the field If need be I can read that out In fact my idea might be to suggest that all Sukoma women are likely to be the most susceptible targets weak and <O/> as they are for those who look for human scapegoats to explain the  shortenings><+_shortcomings> of society This was prominently established with the rise of the <name/> groups known in Sukoma and <name/> areas by the name of <name/> This movement sought to eliminate some forms of insecurity and injustice consequently brought havoc for older women who saw the movement as a resurgence of traditional male aggression and oppression <Name/> members being Sukoma themselves hated old women who are vulnerable to perceptions of ill omen Sukoma I mean in Sukoma communities However it is very difficult without detailed case material to confirm the mere assertion of the above theories 
<$A> However Dr UUUMesack states some of the reasons that has made him to establish the witch killings in Sukoma land 
<$B> I have established that witch killings in Sukoma epitomise the cultural clash between idealised modernisation goals of the state and cosmology of the Sukoma people and the <name/> people and in Sukoma the political and economic change including the abolition of traditional rule Villagization and the development of commodity production has unleashed the number of contending forces Crime homicides and especially killing of suspected witches can thus be viewed as an expression of this contest in an area where old cultural forms are still powerful The witch killings in Sukoma pose a threat to peace and security of course which are indispensable for social and economic development of our country I relate to the particular significance of the preponderance of women as victims in this phenomena This IIImis misogyny is unacceptable in the nineteen nineties and above all an anathema to the ideology of <ea/>ujamaa in Tanzania and the peace and tranquillity we have been enjoying all this long At the root of this dilemma of course is a question of belief It is illusory to think that beliefs and norms of people can be transformed while the basic social situation within which they act and react they remain unchanged As such it can be hypothesised that witchcraft will continue to be a threat because the fact that witchcraft is flourishing remain The state authorities shown evidence of the ability to control these factors
<$A> After Dr UUUMesack's presentation the participants had a chance to present their views Professor Daudens Impangala <name/> Director University of Dar es Salaam emphasized the need to make more researches on witchcraft because people say their beliefs are primitive they don't exist and so talking about them or doing research on them is wasting time 
<$C> So this attitude has developed in our society to the extent that it has also  influence><+_influenced> state organs The law is not very clear on this issue you see uh Actually I helped to realize a revival of RRRof a big revival of interest on the research of witchcraft in Europe I was surprised There is a lot of research which has been done on Nigeria and Cameroon particularly West Africa and in fact in Nigeria and Cameroon uh the law is very clear on issues of witchcraft and how to deal with witchcraft but in our case here it is something which has to be secret It is to be secret because for this church to show that it is it believes that these beliefs or witchcraft activities are there No it is uh something bad So what I would like to say is that I think it is time because something which exists It's a belief which exists and which affects people such as such RRRsuch big numbers of killings You can't just brush it away as something primitive It doesn't need our attention I think the initiative of Dr UUUMesack to do research on witchcraft should be widened so that we address this issue also from the academic and intellectual point of view 
<$A> Avemaria <name/> agrees with the reasons Dr UUUMesack gave on the paper on why women are murdered but she still had other points to add 
<$D> But I think there RRRthere is something which is missing because few days ago we heard over the media that one woman was caught uh somewhere in UUUokonga or whatever naked very early in the morning I don't know they said that she was doing some witches around the house of somebody and again few months ago we heard that a woman in RRRin Dodoma I think was again arrested because she had limbs of a human being That one again was through the media but when she was asked she said that the woman went for abortion and unfortunately she died so she was trying to RRRto you know to conceal that body but you know despite the fact that there are some cases of victimization but there are doubts RRRdoubts sometimes as to the you know to this accusation because like the case in uh RRRin UUUokonga I don't know maybe we need now to take action and see how that woman was blamed for or for just bewitching somebody's house And uh secondly in Sukoma what I came to discover again maybe it will be just an addition because when I was doing the research on environment we were faced again with the same problem but the explanation which we are given is that that system of uh you know young couples to stay with their parents-in-laws the family of their husband contributes a lot to this uh accusation when the mother-in-law now gets old because most of the mothers-in-laws treat badly their daughters-in-laws when they come to their houses They overwork them They accuse them They do whatever they wish to them so when they are liberated now they go and start their own household somewhere and then the mother-in-law gets old and uh she RRRshe has to go and stay with that uh family again That daughter-in-law in most cases is not happy to see that the very mother-in-law who was uh uh victimizing her now comes and stays there with their BBBwith theirRRR BBBwith theirRRR families and usually they just go and whisper to the <ea/>zunguzungus and the <ea/>zunguzungu will come and act They give an ultimatum if she doesn't move they just kill her 
<$A> Then Dr UUUMesack clarified on <name/> naked cases He said it is difficult to say on that because the law is not clear 
<$B> Our witchcraft treatise is very It's very ambiguous It's not IIIexp explicit as if you go and read the Ugandan witchcraft act of nineteen seventy-six which just states categorically that witchcraft does not include bona fide <ea/><O/> <O/> and stuff whereas in our case uh it's very ambiguous In fact it talks about sorcery and enchantment even in the case of you know limbs being found you know with this other person So it need a lots of reforming and also to be explicit It's not easy to RRRto prove a witchcraft case and that's why for example that out you pointed out the case that most of these Sukoma and <name/> women would be living with their grandchildren and they are living with them so that they can help you know in case of need and trouble and if for example they come the killers come and kill this old woman the evidence of the child who was in the house is not taken as evidence in law It's not BBBit's notRRR allowed in law because he is an under-age person who cannot satisfy Therefore again you know the law is not I mean it's against you know the procedure I think the prosecution procedure at court 
<$A> Fortunately some of the participants who attended the seminar were coming from Shinyanga and Mwanza regions One of them was Helen <name/> She expresses her feelings concerning the murder of old women 
<$E> I'd been uh A relative of mine who was killed as a witch and actually she's RRRshe's a younger sister to my grandmother so in Sukoma I just call her grandmother and so this woman was killed and actually I am also a medical uh person and I'm quite interested because it really frustrates me and I'm glad that in his paper Dr <name/> mentioned the possibility of a correlation or linkage between what is happening and the epidemics like measles cholera and dysentery because just a few days ago I was talking to another old woman from my village She had come visiting and I was asking her about the status at home She was saying that people are dying a lot of children because of bloody diarrhoea but we are just waiting our time to be killed because whenever a child dies there must be found a witch but actually this old woman is so brave she knows even some linkage So I was thinking maybe in our future plans we could see whether the increase in killings uh witch killings is somehow correlated to disease epidemics to just to confirm probably some of the hunches we already have so that even if we are strategising then we know actually even how to teach people to educate people in this particular aspect because I actually I have a hunch that there is an increase in witch killings during a disease epidemic especially dysentery and measles so and Dr <name/> touched on this particular issue here and I also wanted to point out on the villagization Actually it is really a frustration to the Sukoma community to have been moved and live in those villages because actually the population increased and there are lots of mixing and losing uh of the values which they had

<$A> Radio Tanzania presents Book Review This week we will be reviewing a book entitled The Gift of Life by Patricia Kage Our reviewer is Edwin Semsaba
<$B> This is a love story concerning a woman Tembi Gumbi and it takes place in South Africa It was early in the morning when in attempting to cross a traffic <O/> through Johannesburg Street Tembi was nearly knocked down by a car driven by one young man Traffic came to a halt as the young man got out of the car to give a word or two to Tembi Irrespective of the atmosphere prevailing at the material time both noted that the other's presence was captivating The young man returned to his car and drove off while Tembi entered a streetside cafe and ordered a drink to enable her to return to her senses after surviving what would have been a nasty accident Two weeks later Tembi's mother gave a twenty-fourth birthday party for her daughter Her father <name/> Gumbi who after years of poverty and toil in Soweto was now a well-to-do man who could afford lavish life and a birthday party to match Tembi was a senior secretary to one of the editors of the large daily Johannesburg newspapers When the party was on she heard  his><+_her> father calling her name from behind She was smiling as she turned around but abruptly the smile faded from what her eyes encountered The author writes why her smile faded in the following ways 
The smile faded from her lips as she found herself gazing into the glittering eyes of the man standing next to her the man who had so nearly knocked her down two weeks earlier For a moment the room and everything else faded into the background and she was aware of nothing but him as their eyes met He looked equally  astound><+_astounded> Suddenly he smiled and his eyes lit up Tembi snapped out of her trance-like state and she saw her father propel his companion towards her Tembi I would like you to meet UUUNduduzi He's an industrial relations consultant and it is men like him that we call on to help with the staff disputes and problems said <name/> UUUNduduzi this is my daughter Tembi It is her birthday That's how Tembi and UUUNduduzi met for a second time in a more civilised manner UUUNduduzi's work sometimes took him to other centres and being an only child he was very much attached to his parents who lived in Cape Town During the party proceedings UUUNduduzi took Tembi outside to the veranda There were only two of them The air was cool and the sky was clear and full of stars A full moon hung overhead and its silver light threw the surrounding trees and shrubs into brilliant spectacle UUUNduduzi started I can't believe I'm here and that I've met you again You won't believe me how many times during the past two weeks your image has haunted me incessantly Nothing like that ever happened to me before Then tonight you turned around when your father spoke and I felt as if I'd been <O/> For a moment I thought I was hallucinating I could see nothing but you I too couldn't believe it when I saw you she whispered in reply He took one of her hands and held it gently and kissed it Have dinner with me tomorrow night he asked still holding her hand and looking deep in her eyes Tembi felt her heart thudding against her rips every nerve then tingling vibrantly with the supercharged sensitivity She shook her head I am sorry UUUNduduzi I already have a date she replied with genuine regret in her voice Break it he said squeezing her hand away I wouldn't do that to you if it was the other way round and I won't to do it to Roy I'm sorry He means something special to you this Roy Yes he's just a good friend she smiled He relaxed and released his breath Forgive me I had no right to ask you that he said ruefully Monday night then Yes thank you I'd like that very much They met on Monday night and had dinner together Then UUUNduduzi went to Capetown for two weeks These two weeks were like hell to Tembi When he returned the affair gained overwhelming proportions as writes the author Never again Tembi UUUNduduzi said in a low intense tone I never want go anywhere else without you ever again I know we only met a short while ago but I have been waiting all my life for you I knew you were the one on the night of your party And the past three weeks have merely confirmed it This time away from you has been sheer hell I love you my darling more than I'll ever be able to tell you You are the other half of me and together we form one perfect unit Do you understand what I am trying to say Of course I understand Being your other half how could I not she replied I love you UUUNduduzi so very much she IIIwhis RRRshe whispered her fingers tracing the outlines of his face as if trying to imprint it for ever on her memory Without you  I'm><+_I> simply cannot function properly any more I need you to make my life complete I'm yours body and soul <O/> He embraced her and said Marry me Tembi Come and live here and share my home my bed my life and my future with me he asked softly Oh yes I want to be your wife more than anything else in the world she replied without hesitation tears of happiness filling her eyes Then disaster struck Tembi was attacked by polio and got hospitalised The doctors said there was hope she won't be crippled The only consolation is that we believe she will not be crippled Her legs appear to be the only limbs affected her right one more so than the left Of course we could be wrong but present indications are that with intensive physiotherapy and her full co-operation she should be left with little more than a weakness in that leg It was a big blow to her fiancee and her parents After three months although there were signs of improvement the physiotherapy and other factors were too much for Tembi She lost her head When UUUNduduzi visited her one day she said please forgive me but I have realised that everything has changed I've changed I can't marry you I will be a dreadful burden to you if we were to marry It is going to be a long time before I've recovered sufficiently to be independent I will be able to get about on crutches admittedly but what kind of life will it be for you In your life of business it is essential that you mix socially and entertain and believe me I would be an embarrassment to you No stop it You cannot be an embarrassment to me Oh yes I would Also you and I both want children and I don't know how long it will be before my legs could stand the strength of pregnancy if ever I want your life to be happy and fulfilled Failing to convince her otherwise UUUNduduzi saw that their love had come to an end He went away angry and confused Tembi meanwhile improved and was discharged She became an outpatient but still used crutches and at times the wheelchair She had already decided to be alone One day she was requested to perform in a charity show for the disabled She agreed After strenuous practice as was a good singer and organist she was soon prepared to perform with other disabled people on stage The day of the charity show came Her performance was electrifying and when the show ended she was given a standing ovation while seated in a wheelchair It was at this time that Tembi looked at the members of the audience getting out of the hall when  he><+_she> saw UUUNduduzi escorting a very beautiful lady It dawned on BBBhim<+_her> that UUUNduduzi after what she said to him and he found another lover She got very pained especially on the harsh decision of parting with UUUNduduzi Anyway bygones were bygones She decided to go to Port Elizabeth with <name/> in order to erase the past On her return from Port Elizabeth she met with UUUNduduzi who had come to their home Patricia Kage writes UUUNduduzi what are you doing here I've come to take you home my darling he said his voice low but quite steady Don't touch me UUUNduduzi as you did not take long to find a replacement for me after the break up did it Then UUUNduduzi explained himself and Tembi understood My dear Tembi I've missed you so much UUUNduduzi my dearest UUUNduduzi please hold me close and don't ever let me go again Then he helped her to sit on the bench then taking her ring from inside pocket of his jacket he again slid it onto the third finger of her left hand repeating the words he had spoken once before With this ring I put my heart and life into your keeping Guard them well my love I will I promise and this time I really mean it no matter what happens She replied in a short voice They stayed for a while arms about each other not quite believing that they were once again together determined never again to be parted Marriage day was fixed Tembi practised walking very hard without using the crutches On the marriage day as UUUNduduzi set near the alter waiting for  her><+_his> bride to enter the church he got the amazement of his life The author writes when they arrived in the church <name/> helped her out of the car and <name/> carried then  his><+_her> flowers As they reached the door leading to the church Tembi stopped and gave her crutches to her father Leave them at the big <ea/>baba We can pick them up later I won't be needing them for a while she said a jubilant smile lighting up her face I've been secretly practising walking without them for weeks I wanted to surprise everybody and from the look on your faces I've certainly succeeded very well <Name/> handed Tembi her flowers and watched as she took her father's arm holding on firmly as the organist started to play the tune Here comes the bride and they started for the alter  Gaps><+_Gasps> from the multitude made UUUNduduzi turn to look He was amazed With his eyes ablaze with love and pride he gazed at his beloved Tembi as she walked slowly confidently and triumphantly down the aisle towards him and their future

Working in partnership is the theme for this year's Commonwealth Day an annual event observed on the second Monday of the month of March which this year falls on March the eleventh In her message to mark this day the Head of the Commonwealth Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second of Britain points out that this theme reminds us that we can achieve much more if we work in a team making use of each other's different skills and experience than if we are all separately trying to do the same thing A successful partnership depends on mutual respect and friendship and what matters is not what people are but what they can contribute to the common purpose Partnership builds on experience drawing lessons from the past and cementing shared friendships And it looks to the future as it tackles the challenges of the present The Commonwealth is an excellent example of this kind of partnership The fifty-three sovereign nations who belong to it have vastly different social and ethnic traditions But it has been able to fashion unity out of this diversity and to become a working partnership of governments and peoples The ninety-ninety-six Commonwealth Day comes exactly four months since the biannual Commonwealth summit ended in New Zealand last November Among the highlights of the Oakland summit was the admission of Mozambique into the club which increased its membership to fifty-three Mozambique unlike the rest of the club members is lusophone that is a former Portuguese colony It is non-anglophone The New Zealand summit came up with a number of resolutions on the international situation as well as problems with the club in particular the slow pace of democratisation processes in three West African countries Nigeria Sierra Leone and the Gambia In Nigeria the military authorities have been reluctant to hand over power to a civilian government which they had promised to do in nineteen ninety-three The Commonwealth leaders were also irked by the Nigeria's decision to execute nine human rights' activists of the minority Ogoni tribe The executions took place while the Oakland summit was under way In addition to suspending Nigeria's membership of the club the Commonwealth leaders also gave the authorities in Abuja two years until the next Commonwealth summit due to be held in Britain next year to hand over power to civilian rule or face outright expulsion In Sierra Leone general elections went ahead this week as planned despite a coup earlier this year However a re-run of the elections has been necessary because no outright winner emerged In the Gambia where a coup in nineteen ninety-four deposed President Dawda El Jawara elections are planned for July this year and the club has offered help to carry out the democratisation process The Oakland summit also appointed an eight member committee to monitor democracy and human rights in member states Election processes have in the meantime being preceded in other Commonwealth African nations including Zimbabwe Zambia and Uganda It is our hope that the elections in the Gambia will go ahead as scheduled When captain Yahga Jame deposed <name/> Dawda eight months ago he said at first that he would soon hand over power to a civilian administration His promise was not forthcoming and he is reported to have said he would hang on to power until nineteen ninety-eight
We believe the Commonwealth committee to monitor democracy and human rights in member states will receive maximum co-operation wherever it goes to perform its duties if concerned nations are really serious to return to democracy and respect human rights We expect that by the time the Commonwealth heads of state and government meet in Britain next year democracy will have fully returned to Sierra Leone and the Gambia as well as Nigeria which has announced a programme to return to civilian rule

The fourteenth joint scientific conference organised by the National Institute for Medical Research has just ended in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha High on the agenda were research priorities for Tanzania to prevent and control major diseases in the country in particular malaria and human helminthiasis or ones which are becoming a health problem in the country According to papers presented at the conference the two diseases are a real major health problems to Tanzania For example malaria was described as a public health problem for the last two decades and remained a fatal killer despite different options to control it The conference was told that malaria counts for thirty-one point four per cent for the twelve important diseases reported In hospitals malaria death ranged from three to five per cent of all admissions and it alone causes twelve to fifteen per cent of the childhood deaths Malaria is also a health hazard for women Malaria leads to anaemia which is one of the major causes of maternal death The Arusha conference was also told that prevalence and intensity of intestinal worm infection among school-aged children in Tanzania is so high that it may have contributed to poor school performance and poor nutritional status of the pupils The prevalence rate of worms or human helminthiasis in various parts of the country was over ninety-eight per cent Recent research in Tanga revealed as high a prevalence rate as ninety per cent and seventy-eight per cent for hook worm and <O/> infection respectively while in Zanzibar the prevalence was over ninety-eight per cent for five to ten years age group A report presented by the school health programme team of the ministry of health said worm  infection><+_infections> among children in many parts of the country were so common that parents hardly recognised them as a serious health problem <O/> particularly severe hookworm infections are associated with impaired cognitive functions as well as such school outcome measures as absenteeism and enrolment and attrition Intestinal worms have also been found to be significantly associated with anaemia in primary school children With this background it is high time to devise strategies to prevent and control these public health problems To this end the deliberations at the conference in Arusha have to be digested and utilised They should be the guidelines in the war against malaria and worms in the country For example at the conference medical and health experts called for the introduction of school health education programmes specifically aimed to address worm infection Such programmes could raise public awareness on how to prevent and control worm infection On malaria the Arusha conference was told that despite efforts by the government which  includes><+_include> availability of essential drugs throughout the country and use of insecticide bednets in the new urban mosquito vector control the trend has not been encouraging It was at this juncture the director general of National Institute for Medical Research professor Wenceslaus Kilama said there was need for intensified research to address the grave malaria situation through research and different control technologies Unfortunately the main victims of malaria and worms are women and children the major producers and the future generation Because of their crucial role in the society let all those concerned come up with tangible solutions to these health problems facing women and children

The tenth international conference on AIDS has just ended in the Japanese city of Yokohama with the pledges and resolutions expected to spearhead the fight against the spread of the disease The ninth international conference which was held in Berlin in June last year drew about fifteen thousand people and came up with more or less similar resolutions This conference like the previous one held in the Netherlands laid a great stress on the role of non-governmental and community-based organisations and on AIDS topics related specifically to women and young people More than eleven thousand people from one hundred and twenty-eight countries attended the Yokohama conference For the first time an international conference on AIDS was this year held in Asia Asia has hitherto been among regions of the world which have not been hard hit  with><+_by> the spread of HIV or the disease caused by the virus AIDS struck in Asia about a decade later than in Europe and the United States leading to fewer deaths from the disease in the region Currently there are an estimated two point five million Asians carrying the HIV virus and the number of HIV cases in the region is expected to rise to ten million by the year two thousand So the conference was held in Asia to drive home the point that AIDS is poised to sweep the continent with a devastating impact than it has swept other regions such as Africa south of the Sahara Since the mid nineteen seventies the HIV has infected more than seventeen million people in the world most of them in Africa Latest figures show there are about ten million HIV cases in sub-Saharan Africa and with the epidemic now exploding in Asia the number of infections world-wide is expected to exceed forty million by the year two thousand The figures show that at the global level some four million people have developed full-blown AIDS since the IIIep since the beginning of the epidemic one point five million in nineteen ninety-three alone Last December nearly three thousand people attended the eighth international conference on AIDS in Africa held in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh The conference came up with what was described as the Marrakesh appeal which in a nutshell contained resolutions aimed at checking the spread of the disease The executive director of the World Health Organisation's global programme on AIDS Dr <name/> used the occasion to state that if African leaders commit themselves fully to AIDS prevention and care and if all Africans also commit themselves they could turn the continent's success stories into Africa's defeat of AIDS Dr <name/>'s remark is as true today as it was when he made it in December In many if not all African countries campaigns to educate and sensitise the masses on ways of checking the spread of the virus and the disease itself have been held Seminars workshops and symposiums have been conducted and reports broadcast or published in mass media organisations with the same aim But IIIth these are not enough for although people may listen to such reports through radio and television stations or read them in newspapers people's actions matter very much Individual characters and lifestyles could be the deciding factors to determine whether campaigns to fight the spread of the HIV and AIDS will succeed

The first international conference on the elimination of leprosy held in Vietnam this month has ended with the adoption of the Hanoi declaration on the elimination of the disease The declaration adopted unanimously by conference delegates from twenty-eight countries where leprosy is still endemic calls for stronger and decisive commitment of all interested parties towards fighting the dreadful disease The declaration stressed that the multi-drug therapy a combination of anti leprosy drugs as recommended by World Health Organisation represents an unparalleled opportunity to master the scourge of humanity which is thousands of years old We warmly welcome the Hanoi accord and hope that the WHO and the international community at large will attain the desired call of eradicating leprosy by the year two thousand For centuries leprosy control consisted mainly of isolating patients and genuine treatment of the disease started in the nineteen fifties with the introduction of a drug called Dapsun Within twenty-five years however the disease had become resistant to the drug rendering treatment increasingly ineffective In nineteen eighty-one the multi-drug therapy was introduced on the recommendation of a WHO study group The multi-drug therapy is a combination of three drugs for severe cases and two drugs for milder cases and since its introduction leprosy has been greatly reduced During the first ten years since its introduction the disease was reduced by more than sixty per cent To date the multi-drug therapy has succeeded in reducing the number of leprosy cases world-wide by some seventy per cent The WHO says however that leprosy is considered to have been eliminated as a public health problem when its prevalence rate falls below one per ten thousand population The organisation says the elimination of the disease as a public health problem does not mean total eradication and that small numbers of cases will continue to occur beyond the year two thousand due to the long incubation period of the disease It says leprosy cannot be eliminated unless the multi-drug therapy coverage is increased to a level exceeding eighty-five per cent and kept there for four to five years If as the WHO puts it elimination does not mean total eradication cases of the disease could be detected even after the target of the year two thousand Moreover there are only five and a half years left before the target date is reached Now that the Vietnam conference has come up with a blueprint for eradicating leprosy we feel all the countries where the disease is endemic should devise ways of confronting the problem Three years ago the WHO established a working group on leprosy control to advise on various issues such as increasing the participation of leprosy-endemic countries in disease control efforts and increasing support and co-ordination between various leprosy agencies It is estimated that six to seven million cases will need to be diagnosed and  cures><+_cured> in the next six years to meet the elimination target Leprosy affects countries mainly in the developing world South-east Asia region is the worst affected followed by Africa and Latin America If at all efforts to eliminate the disease are to succeed countries with leprosy cases should start at the national level before moving to the international level For this reason therefore leprosy must be given high priority in a world that faces many problems

President Nelson Mandela of South Africa has declared the first one hundred days of his government a success and has promised that with the end of the apartheid era the Government will totally transform South Africa He says his government's reconstruction and development programme worth six hundred eighty-five million US dollars had begun to eliminate the backlogs of forty-six years of apartheid Mr Mandela who is now seventy-six years old was elected South Africa's first black president by Parliament following his landslide victory in April's first historical all-race elections in which his African National Congress ANC won sixty-six per cent of the votes He was elected president on May the ninth and was installed the next day Soon after assuming power his government has been working on a programme of change aimed at redressing the legacy of apartheid Rural development programmes have been launched including water and sanitation for one hundred for one point seven million people in Northern Transvaal and Kwazulu Natal Provinces the return of land to twenty-nine thousand people disposed under apartheid and a land settlement programme for two thousand families In an address to Parliament in Capetown Mr Mandela outlined the achievements in the first one hundred days of his democratic government He said South Africans have at last a robust and vibrant democracy with broad consensus on the most important national issues He said South Africans have forged an enduring national consensus on the interim constitution and the broad objective of reconstruction and development All analysts agree that the broad consensus on the most important national issues is neither an imposition of one party over others nor a honeymoon promised on the fickle whims of a fleeting romance The reconstruction and development programme christened as RDP is an all encompassing process of transforming society in its totality to ensure a better life for all the people in South Africa President Mandela has won high marks for supporters and most rivals for his statesmanship White separatist Constan Villion who opposed Mr Mandela's release from prison in nineteen ninety and started campaigns for a white Afrikaner homeland has said the black president was an asset to South Africa Responding to concerns that the arrival of a black leader has not resulted in a rapid improvement in living standards a member of Mr Mandela's Cabinet Mr Caderl Asmal said that all has been done by the Government had been done in three months in a country that white government has taken forty-six years to bring it to its knees It is against this background the achievements in the first one hundred days of the democratic Government of South Africa should be praised It is clear indication that at the end of the six hundred and eighty-five million dollar reconstruction and development programme there will be a great change in South Africa An American who drafted a code of conduct for United States business with South Africa during the apartheid era was stunned by changes that have been taking place in South Africa Addressing a news conference in Johannesburg on his first visit to South Africa since he was refused a visa to enter the country in nineteen eighty-seven three years before Mr Mandela was released Mr Leon Sullivan outlined his own six-year post-apartheid plan The plan had two major thrusts One of them is a multi-million dollar education and training programme aimed at making black South Africans part of the economic mainstream He said his foundation would invest ten million US dollars in the programme and he had commitments from other US citizens and corporations for further contributions for the programme The second thrust is investment He urged US companies to return to South Africa to help reconstruct the country This is yet another indication that the changes in the first one hundred days of the government in South Africa have attracted not only the people of South Africa themselves but also those abroad It is our belief that the new democratic Government of Nelson Mandela will receive co-operation and the necessary support to enable it to continue with its plans to transform the country

Yugoslavia Tens of thousands of young girls and women mainly Muslims have been victims of gang rape in what has been referred to as ethnic cleansing in the Balkans We hope that the Peking conference will address itself to these dehumanising issues and solve them once and for all The Fourth World Conference on Women comes at a time when rural poverty is growing faster than world population and women are especially hard hit Of the one billion people living below the poverty line in the developing world sixty per cent are women Over the past two decades their numbers have increased by fifty per cent as compared to a thirty per cent increase for men Worse still rural women are triply disadvantaged As poor they share all the hardships and constraints than men do As women they face discrimination and neglect and when they are heads of household at least twenty-three per cent are in the least developed countries and over thirty per cent in sub-Saharan African In nineteen ninety there were eight hundred and twenty-eight million economically active women Fifty-six per cent were in Asia twenty-nine per cent in the industrialised countries nine per cent in Africa and five per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean Women are a powerful force for development In addition to being responsible for home and children for example they produce at least half of the food consumed in the developing world and as much as eighty per cent in Africa In Latin America women contribute fifty per cent or more of the income in more than half of all smallholder farming families Five regional preparatory conferences will be held in Africa Asia Europe Latin America and the Caribbean as well as western Asia to look at specific regional concerns before the Peking conference is held We expect Tanzania which has provided the Peking conference with a secretary-general will fully participate in the conference by sending a powerful delegation to the Chinese capital Before then all women in the country irrespective of their political affiliations should make sure that adequate preparations are made at the national level for the Fourth World Conference for Women in Peking China to be held from September the fourth to the fifteenth nineteen ninety-five

The international community is observing Women's day International Women's Day is an annual event marked on March the eighth by a host of activities aimed at advancing the status of women It is observed at both national and international levels This year's Women's Day comes only six months after the fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing China last September We believe that resolutions adopted in Beijing are still fresh in the minds of many women who attended the conference and a few women's organisations at the national level should consult their respective governments on how to lay groundwork for the implementation of the resolutions in particular the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action unanimously adopted at the conference The Declaration and Platform of Action reflects a new international commitment to the goals of equality development and peace for all women everywhere It defines strategic objectives and spells out actions to be taken over the next five years by governments the international community non-governmental organisations and the private sector for the removal of the main obstacles to women's advancement Since the United Nations held the first World Conference on Women in Mexico City in nineteen seventy-five some progress has been made towards achieving equality between men and women Women's access to education and proper health care has increased and their participation in the paid labour force has grown Legislation that promises equal opportunities for women and respect for their human rights has been adopted in more countries Despite this development discrimination against women is still widespread Violence against women remains a global phenomenon Women's equal access to resources is still restricted and their opportunities for higher education and training are concentrated in limited fields Take Tanzania for example in the distribution of decision making positions in the civil service in mainland Tanzania In nineteen eighty-eight the percentage of male ministers to female ministers was seventy-five to twenty-five while that of deputy ministers IIIwa was eighty-three to seventeen and that of principal secretaries ninety-five to five There were no female regional development directors and regional commissioners while the percentage of District Commissioners was eighty-nine to eleven The percentage of males and females in the National Assembly in the nineteen eighty nineteen eighty-five and nineteen ninety general elections remained unchanged at eighty-nine to eleven It only changed during the first multiparty elections last year in which the percentage of female members of parliament rose to sixteen point four of the two hundred and seventy-five member national assembly Tanzanians are observing the nineteen ninety-six Women's Day at the national level by week-long activities in Dar es Salaam Opening the activities at the Msimbazi Community Centre in the city the vice-president Dr Omar Ali Juma said the union government will form a task force to look for ways of improving the social and economic status of women in the country All Tanzanians especially the women know very well that the government has made sound efforts to create conditions that enable women to increase their knowledge of the main problems in contemporary international relations through institutional political education and through informal channels such as the radio and newspapers Last year a national board was created to cater for women's interests irrespective of their political affiliations We appeal to women not to rely much on government's efforts in advancing their cause The new body called Tanzania Women's Council BAWATA should take full charge to ensure women's aspirations and expectations in Tanzania are met their human rights respected and all discrimination against women stopped
