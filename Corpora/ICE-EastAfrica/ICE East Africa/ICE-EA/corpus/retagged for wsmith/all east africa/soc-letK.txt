<name/> Dear,
I am just from a grading exam (CAT) and believe me  its><+_it's> only this thought of that is redeeming. In short to think of you and a more such for an imagined company gives a *cathasis> which life and reminds me of a special somebody who beyond doubt  care><+_cares>!
 Its><+_It's> exactly four *weaks> and believe to me  Its><+_It's> a hell of time. The feeling *disoluteness> loneliness and emptiness is the RRRthe greatest silly business. How are you my sweet-heart? Since that Friday like I saw your face last thought that I could stick the image in the memory but that very memory I trusted has a blurred *tattued> and eventual patching as I figure *you> beautiful face. Smile! Thanks.
<name/> is fine and JAH protection  shine><+_shines> all over. My dear, work, <ea/>kazi, work Too much Class work then the theatre and the extra mural classes that soon. By the way we were to come those sides and I just wanted to *suprise> you by the visit but with semester (term) being midway then too much work won't allow; for in four weeks time it will be exams time. Otherwise till early April after 23rd *march> break I think things won't work out. but then also this only tentative (hope holding 'things' constant)
How is the hard-swathing business, <ea/>kusoms? I hope the books are not driving you nuts. Keep your distance and drive safely "for *alittle> road courtesy won't hurt" The business of books and pens is no oranges but nothing comes out of nothing. So sweet, it is hard-on smartly for pain is gain at last.
When do you break for holiday? A very odd question to ask after only four solid weeks but you got to forgive! Not so hurting if you doesn't suffer homesick. Here it marathon till end of June and end of the Road, the long journey but there is a weekend break from 22-25th March then another start of the academic tail. For sure so far have UUUmy way of celebrating end of the road whether a bull or elephant I <O/>. I have to wait till we reach the bridge. No  its><+_it's> a weekend with you at the ocean ... ?
 Seem><+_seems> am writing to much yet *to> little and you've to pardon me for it is my career (journalism). I wanted to say love you and to tell you that I will never let you free if  your><+_you> mistakenly said 'I do', for me it was till DEATH and so the philosophy lives. If only I had a little time for  trip there, but then what are the conditions in the institute? Any time a walk in time a town with many buses which might have distanced 'my' from me I always fight this temptation of getting into one and they always leave me lonely and cold as you can't imagine. Always also dwells the thought that you've just *aline> from the institute and you looking for the way to my rooms.  Seem><+_seems> a joke to be laughed off but RRRbut this the madness I have nurse and bare. I swear if this kind of loneliness  continue><+_continues>don't be *suprised>!
With nostalgia sweet, I remembered the new year eve (that even *hads> headache to the longing to be with you) that *clutting> morning breeze as we shared, it  give><+_gives> me a *momental> tickle that wringed my heart. Though not prepared or *frustratedly> not expecting the start of year that  make><+_makes> me believe that all the year will be of great beautiful blessing. The moment of sharing *giveth> me hope which make me feel our being together is long overdue <name/> you are my heart, my life, anything I do it is yours so please I beg don't break my heart at any moment. Don't *dislay> my life a *pleach> My life depends on you! Forgive <slang/>4 what happened or didn't happen on 31st - 1st.
Sorry for impatience for I can wait also for 1st January bounce please for I couldn't have helped it . Sorry for not giving the <slang/>xmas its deal please you've to forgive for I wonder what hurts and *whats> makes you hearty. It may be many situations or few or one hurt you but please don't let it go don't let me go *soot.free>, please shout for all I do is out of love.
Otherwise <name/> (the one who makes me happy) I wish you cool studies, Happy Valentine (14th Feb) and much love for the plans He has for us is for prosperity. Please I care I beg don't be carefree. Say hi to 'Them' 
for you and always
*addedum>
* <slang/>Pliz send me some RRRsome negative for they are safer then photo so that I won't have to imagine from far I need your face (photo) serious 
* <slang/>Pliz the promise remember always on the wait
*I rang your brother and promised a visit so I still wait after the weekend which we was going to Nakuru.

<name/> dear,
What can you see, how do you feel and what do you suggest? on what? Can you guess and try to imagine who the <foreign/>homo <foreign/>sapiens is at this odd hour of the day? It's none else apart from <name/> who has decided to rise at last.
Sorry I had promised to write first and I failed. All the same I thank God <slang/>coz of a dear friend of Mine somewhere who said 'better late than never'. <ea/>Ama? Anyway I <slang/>juz wanted to fetch some news for you.
<ea/>Inanu <ea/>aba <ea/>i; How dare you call yourself a man of broken dreams and broken heart? God for-bid! Many others But in your case your dreams remain to be ever true!
<ea/>Hakika I *recieved> yours <ea/>na <ea/>kusema <ea/>ukweli I was so glad though I felt *guity> for failing to fulfill the promise. which? All the same take it <slang/>coooo-oolly.
<ea/>Pole <ea/>sana for what befell you. Thank God he saved you. PRAISE HIM! It had really troubled My mind thinking about your how-abouts until when I learnt it from you that all was well with you and I felt completely relieved.
I hope <name/> explained it to you the reason as to why I couldn't send him. Now dear What are those *strainly> sustained and chained feelings that you have calling upon tears over fate?
<slang/>Tiz my deep desire, hope and sincere prayer that it may never happen on the planet earth. It would better happen to <ea/>akina Jupiter and *mars> and never here.
You still remember my birth-day on 30th September? I thank God you still remember.
Any news here? I don' know. The son of man has become a *bother> to me. I've insulted and ignored him in vain and now I've decided to send the one he'll fear. Imagine he was about to swallow UUUrat-rat before my eyes another day! Thank God the UUUmaune <slang/>p'ple were here.
<name/> greets you so much, says she never made it for the interviews <slang/>coz of money problems.
There is *alot> to say as you can *guezz> but time factor and *commitements> here and there are forcing me to call it off.
Share my love with <name/> and your other friends.
Bye!
Call her
W1B-SK03
Dear <name/>!
To start with is much hi sent to you by your <slang/>frien' <name/>. How are you since we departed on *29nt> March? I surmise that <slang/>everythin' is quite *okey> the same case here at Meru. Wish you all the best in your studies.
Perhaps <slang/>ya are wondering what happened to me as I had to write to you immediately from *29nt>. As a matter of fact I misplaced those address. I don't <slang/>knu what's happening on  me. *May> *be> I'm not alone. I've asked <name/>, <name/>. But <name/> only told me that he remembers hall 9 room 509. But this couldn't help at all. So I've to search in all my books page after page but fortunately I found the ones which I had written before on <slang/>Satu *11nt>. I also heard from <name/> as if you were at home again. Is it?
Indeed I went at Nkubu and I was charged the amount I had already informed you 800F @ 400F Well when I went at Meru that day I was only told by a girl whom I met there that filling one front teeth is 700F I believed herself since you had already informed me of the guy you were schooling with. So on 3rd April I was at that dispensary at 8.00am. I was number one to arrive there <slang/>tho I was served being number two.
However things went Contrary of what we expected First I explained the dentist the cause of breakage. He was to test these front teeth lower and upper jaw using <slang/>somethin. Despite the fact that they were broken two there was another *cannine> having a crack. I was told all of them are completely dead from inside! Imagine what I felt. I was nearly to Faint As a result there were two alternatives for them to be done. Either all of them to be removed or since the broken ones are firm and stable a hole to be bored inside each, the nerve providing the teeth with food be removed and then *sumthin> artificial to fill inside. Besides this a tooth will be replaced on that original root and part outside the gum I *choosed> this method although it is very very expensive. For the first alternative it had a disadvantage. Since the artificial gum holding these teeth will have extension covering inside of the mouth it can break if not handled with RRRa great care.
*Inspite> of this I was bored three holes which were to be filled on *10nt> (After a week). Then today I'm to attend so that he can tell me what next. But do you guess the cost
Boring and filling *Costed> 2,650 F
Then filling with others will be 16,500 F imagine. But it can be done one at a time, one teeth 5,500 F.
But my conclusion is since they're now *okey> if he tells me we can continue (after one month appointment) I will change and go to <name/>. I intend even to go there on Thursday.
Well Mr <name/> wants to marry one of the teacher at <ea/>ukuu Sec; Miss <name/>. He has invited us in his pre-wedding to be held on 8th June.
So bye for now until Some other time if God Wishes
Yours .
All information here to be known by you only.

My dear <name/>,
Accept my cordial greetings in the name of Almighty. I am fine here and hope you are still as fine as you stated in your letter which I received a few days ago. 
Well, as you see in the above address, I am in <O/> Armed Forces Training college. I am attending a course since the beginning of March and it will go on until around 20th of June. I was very glad to read from you following a long disturbing silence. I don't need to say how happy I was to learn that you were given a bursary and that you are comfortable. I received <O/> from mum a few days after yours. She told me that you were at home for sometime. She also told me in details about Lucy. She needed some assistance and I did 
P.T.O. 
what I could about it. By that time she had not received <name/>'s salary for the month of February. I don't know what went wrong but I sent a duplicate of the 'receipt' that I was given at the post office after sending the money, to <name/>. I was not able to send <name/>'s salary for the month of March but I did it at the beginning of this month for both (March & April)
You did not tell me about <name/> How is he doing in school? I hope the shoes and the uniform are not worn out. Anyway I will see what to do.
Finally don't worry about the remaining balance. That will be taken care of. And please stop worrying about what will happen after you finish your college studies. That will take care of *itsself>. Just make sure you finish your studies well.
I will see you in July or by <O/>
Yours lovingly 
W1B-SK05
<ea/>Moninga <ea/>wa <ea/>bolingo <ea/>Maringo,
<ea/>Sango <ea/>nini? YES, Happy New month! I'm doing perfectly well in the capital city of the Republic of Kenya. How is you and everything over the other end of planet Earth (<ea/>Shiveye)? Say Hello to all the  nice>+_nieces> and decent people over that end. Sorry for not replying to your letters on time i.e the one dated <date/>and another one dated <date/>.
Boy, I'm beaming with joy especially having been left with only and only 18 days to clear my 118 day or rather 4 months vacation. More encouraging is the fact I paid <name/> a visit on <date/>and had the chance to fall in love with <name/> a 15 year-old pupil at Moi Avenue Primary School. In short she can only be the equivalent of Mariah Carey. <name/> can sure go to hell. To crown it all I checked on my 2nd year results yesterday and they are just fantastic. That means  come><+_comes> <date/>I will roll off the Third Year ramp in top gear.
I met <name/> 34 days ago. She paid us a visit along with <name/> and one UUUIndecke. I promised to pay them a visit but you can be sure I will never. Wow! <name/> is moving around advertising to everybody that I sent him away. His cousin <name/> apologised to me but *cley> I will just show this guy that I'm not one of Ilheo folks. Ileho and me are like a cat  and a mouse. I have no comrades in Ileho. If anything <name/> and me have nothing in common. They were here a train of them last weekend i.e <name/>,<name/>,<name/> etc etc. All I did was to savagely ignore them.
I visited <name/> and <name/> 4 weeks ago. <name/> are beginning their End of Semester Exams on Monday. The boy promised me beers on <date/>and I'm just preparing my throat. I met <name/> at Carol's on <date/>. He talked of <name/> having ballooned <name/>'s daughter (<name/>'s Maid). He alleged that the boy is on compulsory leave. I can't tell <slang/>coz the culture of lies and rumours is deeply rooted in Ileho folks. Anyway have you had the chance of meeting the boy? I was with him on <date/>and he sure talked of a short trip home. When I showed up in Zongai on <date/>he had sure left that morning and he's expected back on<date/>. <ea/>Hata <ea/>hivyo if this letter lands in your hands before he turns back to the city in the sun, tell him to ferry me a bottle of African whisky.
As already said I will appear home on <date/>for 24 hrs. I hope I will easily find my way to Shiveye. spare a few notes and with 538of. in my pocket we will have a swell and memorable time *Particularily> with beer, Music and <ea/>nyawa-choma. I may land in Kisumu on <date/>then Majengo <date/>and finally Shiveye on <date/>date at about 2 pm E.A.T.
Y.F.C '92; let's discuss the fate of this organisation when we meet. However I'm still apprehensive especially at the prospects of Vincent and his clique showing their ugly heads again. I owe Y.F.C '92 98/- and I'm looking *foward> to clearing this debt when I appear home.
About your visit to Nairobi; I welcome you with both hands. I will be on college and you won't get lost. Just immediately after Westlands alight at the second round-about. I will still be in Hall 8 Room 114. Manlaka Rd and state House Rd cross our Halls of residence and some of our notable neighbours are; K.B.C., National Theatre, Norfolk Hotel, Central police station, Lilian's Towers, state House, Nairobi Primary School etc. We will talk more when we meet.
Since you are near Malinya, have you ever stumbled over <name/>? Our parting with that lady was quite in a haste and *Unceremonious>, I wish to meet her once again.
So <name/>, reply immediately <slang/>coz by <date/>I will be on my way home. I wish you love and pleasant moments.
Oh! Boy, Until <date/>
It's !
W1B-SK06
Dear <name/>,
Thanks for your letter which I received just a few days ago. How's you <slang/>bro? I'm as sure as eggs are eggs and not ping *pung> balls that you're fine under our Makers *guindance>. I'm fine too and the same case applies to the rest of the family members.
Alright, Our Easter was very enjoyable because some of us, I included went as far as Embu just to celebrate, others went to Muujwa, Nkubu parishes and others remained in their respective prayer houses for prayers. Otherwise all was well.
I wrote a telegram to <slang/>bro <name/> and on his reply, he notified me that
P.T.O.
he is not in Eldret but in Nakuru for a two months Course which will be over by June. So, he will come home on june>. I got the money.
<name/> is still at home. His *in-Laws>, 'Kina' <name/> and others from Timau will be coming to Mbwinjeru on <date/>On the other hand, Did you know that Dr. <name/> lost his brother on  a road accident? It was on 13th of April when his car (<slang/>bro) pick up, a Nissan and a lorry collided causing deaths of seven people. He was the Kangoro primary school at Chuka Headmaster. We attended his burial ceremony at Chika on <date/>. Now from 13th Mr. <name/> has never *ressumed> to his duties up to date.
Otherwise <name/> I wish you all the best of well and Jesus in all you do
It's with love
W1B-SK07
About Rm No (& Hostel too) - don't know if they might change next "Sem" but I communicate *incase> of any changes! <slang/>Pliz bear with me. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE
Bear with my untidiness <slang/>In a hurry but I hope not next time.
<name/>,
<slang/>Lemmi hope that you're fine, fit and okay, not to forget cheerful as usual. My side I'm fine only *abit> too busy preparing for exams to start next week i.e on 4th March.
Otherwise I got your overwhelming message from <name/> whom *infact> we happen to be sharing the same hostel and floor too. All the same from that day we met at the Bank I've been *okey> under the mercies of God. Life here in Moi isn't bad but appears somehow challenging after a two year mind rest of which I've perceived of having done much  harm than good to my mind.
Anyway I believe I've almost adapted now and back in line. Otherwise, how are the rest of my and your *collegues> up there? I hope they're fine and say 'hi' to them. I hope you remember all of them <slang/>coz they may be quite a number. Here we're with <ea/>akina <name/> and company. They're fine and striving on well. I'm eager to know when you're *living> for Mene. On my side I'm not certain <slang/>abt the specific date <slang/>coz we're or rather I'm leaving this place on 22nd (finishing exams on 21st) and might stay a little bit at my sister's in Nairobi. Let me hope we'll meet at Mene or rather call <number/> (Mene) by the end of first <slang/>wk or start of 2nd <slang/>wk of the <ea/>kaholiday I understand might take only two weeks. Otherwise Best Wishes in your exams as well as nice stay! GOOD LUCK

Dear <name/>
Much and cordial greetings are poured to you at this *momental> juncture. How are you since my last departure and sight at Nakuru. I hope and trust all is running marathon indeed.
As for me here at Nakuru I am physically and mentally favoured by the climate of the great great Rift valley. How was the paper you sat for or not yet to know. I pray that our *almight> God will do miracles and wonders to you, so keep of praying him for he does not fail
Here at Nakuru we are just pushing on with <ea/>Kibarua so that you can attain  you>+_your> daily bread. We were promised to be taken permanents sometimes July so we are eagerly waiting to see our luck.
As you know my aim is get higher as I told you about find a course of which I can do. I went to ask in Kenya Hotel Institute of which they told me unless I leave the job or talk to  boss so that I can get hours for studying. It could not work <slang/>coz we do work in shifts night shift. unless I get somewhere to be staying <slang/>coz I will not be working again each *coure> is one year. If I can get  this><+_these> fees I can leave the job and start. If my *fathy> can accept to pay I can do if possible.
I am homing on 8th June for one week only. I will not pass there as I promised you because <name/> didn't wait for me as we talked, so nobody to show me but if God wishes when I return I will come there even on weekends.
<name/> wrote to me and they are preparing for mid-course exams. The money which I have is limited but I Pray God that I can get only the transport.
My *postbank> is having about 4 *thousands> shillings of which  its><+_it's> continuing to grow. I have a plan of starting my business by January if we will not be employed permanents.
Our cousin <name/> is posted here at Nakuru for *attatchment>; that is provincial *munistry> public works. *Infact> he is in great problem because  its><+_it's> very far from us. Lunch is not all easy to get 'very *costtly> those sides of town so money is a problem to him. We were with <name/> at Nakuru of which he tried his best to come to our place of which I was thankful. So greet him <slang/>co'z he told me you do meet very often at city
bye see you anytime. Give my regards to all those recall me <ea/>Akina <name/> there
<slang/>Tiz 
waiting for reply very soon.
MB I have enclosed that form inside so read it and give me your opinions and return it please when replying this letter.
W1B-SK09
*Hallo> <name/>,
 Hows><+_How's> you boy down there. Hope you are as fine as you left this place. Everybody is as fine up here. Did <slang/>sisty <name/> report at Waithalcas. Say a big hi if she's around.
 Its><+_it's> nothing much but the old story of cash. The stories these sides are not as interesting as you may want them to be. Last week we gave charity to <name/> boys and we were left standing on one foot. As to make everything unbearable there's a tall man we've sent to Nairobi with money that we  dont><+_don't> expect him to refund. So after <name/> leaves today we no longer stand on one foot. We are down flat UUUmendatating what this *gud> thing about money is all about. But the person who drinks our milk daily has understood our fate and has offered us payment of last *years> November (this is quite unfair) at 10£ per kg. Surely it was just yesterday we received the cheques and Mom looks she's not in the mood of receiving money today. I hope you already understand what  am leading to. Please this is not a conman's language but that of a *proffessional> economist <foreign/>cum realistic. So you see <slang/>bro I couldn't send you even a cent as I had promised. You can imagine since you left I  havent><+_haven't> received even a cent except in terms of debts.
I promise once again to send the cash as soon as I receive it anytime this week. Hope you are ready to understand. Ask <name/> how this place is. Everyday *moneydiarrhoeing> (sp.). You can imagine how dry we are. So much of that.
How is our mission going on. Am over anxious to know  whats><+_what's> going on. Did they accept the application? Am waiting to hear from you soonest possible.
So long <slang/>byeee <slang/>'see ya'
<slang/>Bro 
W1B-SK10
My Dearest <name/>,
Christ they kingdom come through Mary. It's my sincere hope and prayer that you are fine. On my side I'm quite fine. My heart is glad my *saul> rejoices and my body dwells secure since our last *site>. As I have said before I hope you're mentally UUUfate, physically well and *acadamically> performing well.
The main gist of decorating this Webuye product is just to inform you on *somethings> here and there. For one everybody is brushing quite well. Mum, <name/>, <name/>, and I are quite alright. <name/> came on *friday> of 17th *may>. He needs 3420 for school fees, and pullover. Anyway through God's miracle he is going to buy a pullover. <O/> he was still suffering from cold. He was gone to <name/> for some medicine and now is <slang/>abit well. <ea/>Akina <name/> came. They were three in number. They were fed well.
About the UUUgachild he's growing rapidly and is *health>. His father was here on 2nd because I had visitors on that following Sunday. He brought 600UUU£ which I used to buy things for the visitors. They were very happy. They brought the baby many clothes and kitchen item. Even '<name/>' <name/>'s boyfriend was among them.
The cows are properly fed. The older one is *healtheir> than the small one. The small one mows every time after finishing the grass.
The rain is still raining in this place. The maize is very green and hearth especially around Mwiti's Iganjo. Coffee is not yet ripe, but it has green berries. <name/> is picking.
Today I'm taking the baby to the Clinic and thus, why I have decided to write this letter very early, so that I can post it as I go.
For now <slang/>bro I don't have much to tell you <slang/>coz the baby is crying. Otherwise pray for us everyday as we pray for you.
God bless you so much.
Yours loving

Anyway as far <OM/> what  am doing here I  cant><+_can't> tell at the moment. So far UUUnimetega four places so the one that comes first then I will inform you soonest possible.
*Okey>, how  is> <+_are>you down there. I'm sure you're quite fine without having to see my bogus face everyday. <ea/>Ana? Well am missing you baggy Believe me <name/> I  cant><+_can't even *concetrate> on anything. I  dont><+_don't> know why  am *becaming> so nervous once I think about you.
<name/>, I want to ask you something and this time I want you to be honest with me. Well, I think you heard me complain that you're becoming so cold nowadays. Please, Please, I'm begging tell me what you think about the future <slang/>coz for one  am beginning to love you seriously & I mean seriously. I  dont><+_don't> want to get hurt in future so BE FRANK.  Have never suffered heart failure <slang/>becoz of LOVE & I  dont><+_don't> want to now.
Otherwise if my decision is yours then please be careful <slang/>coz in Kenya today you  dont><+_don't> know who is who. I could look so healthy today but not so inside. So please, respect <slang/>y'self & I'll do the same. Or its  how?
By the way I asked <slang/>bro (<name/>) about what you told me & the guy was so bitter. He told me not even once has he even come across your <name/> & <name/> at the same time. Anyway  am not surprised. I'm just wishing for the year to end <slang/>coz it has not been easy for me. First it was what happened, then your Grand, then my Father, then <name/> & now this. what will happen next. Well, I'll leave everything to God.
Well,  Am missing you badly. *Forsure> am just longing to see your smile. I think  thats><+_that's> one thing that makes me wet whenever  were><+_we're> together *besides> your kisses.  Am just longing to feel your arms around me. To feel your weight over me and your breath & pulse so close. For sure  am missing <slang/>ya big. Maybe  its><+_it's> because I was so used to seeing you always. I think  am realising how much you mean to me. I sleep holding your snap to my heart yet I  cant><+_can't> help, I need you in person.
So much boredom for now but I, I, I don't feel like stopping yet I  cant><+_can't> say anything constructive.  Am missing you badly. Gosh  am so weak. <O/> UUUeverything. I love you dear.
Believe me I love you.
Please reply.

Dear <name/>
Well, let me start by extending my special regard to you over there. How are you <slang/>baba!? Its my *ope> that you are quite alright. These sides we're neither so bad. Let me go straight to the point <slang/>coz I feel rather drowsy and may not be able to express myself fully.
I received the cards alright, on 24th last month. *Infact> I was shocked <slang/>bcoz I was confused on what to do <slang/>coz the time left for the collection was extremely too short. However I did as you had instructed that is to give to the members that had paid. On giving the members they refused. They said those cards were invalid and it would be a big risk to collect money with the cards whose <ea/>harambee date had expired. However this is a fact but since I  didnot><+_did not> know whether the date was changed or not I could not organise and have the date changed. When I was coming home on 6th I passed through Nairobi university Hall 9 room 220 as you had indicated but found no one. I could see the room belonged to someone like <name/> and <name/> somewhere. Well I waited but I couldn't find anyone to tend On the other hand I fell sick since the time we aking our exams and even that day I was feeling pretty bad. Even at this moment am just from the hospital to take some injections I was prescribed on *tuesday>. Therefore the idea was that I confirm if the <ea/>harambee took place and if it  didnt><+_did not> till when was it postponed to and if possible we change the date and give the cards to the members.
However due to the inconveniences of not finding you I hereby enclose these cards I have and hoping that the date was changed then make arrangements and have the date changed on the cards so that we can release them to members. This is of vital importance and if possible try your level best to make sure it doesn't take too long. On the other hand I have written a letter here to <name/> and I kindly request you to RRRto pass it to him for me <slang/>pliz. Thank you in anticipation and may God bless you. For now bye! and have *nyce> times over there.
Yours

<name/> dear,
<slang/>Howdy, hope everything is all systems go. With me life is alright spinning clockwise as I prepare for my final exams. How's uncle <name/>? I just miss him big. How about <name/>? Anyway just say *hey> to them. Back in convent the regulations have not changed but am glad I just have very few days to go.
Well, I got here safe and sound but the gates *we> locked. Those who were late went home the next day. They have to report back with their parents. I just  dont><+_don't> imagine <ea/>Mzee *accompaning> me <slang/>coz of being late. If I was late I could just get a <ea/>Mzee from nearby, and but these damn level headed women realise he was not my father I could be out of the place.
There had been  interview for *september> secretarial intake. As I <-'/had> from the Area BBCs only five people attended. The <name/> has to adjust the rules if she expects to continue with her business. As the saying goes "If you  dont><+_don't> change, changes will change you" she has to change. She has been dealing with class & leavers and could keep them under very tight rules. Now that she is taking form four leavers she has to change or do away with the secretarial course.
For now I  dont><+_don't> have much to say I just like keeping in contact with you. We are finishing our exams on November 24th. I just long for that day when I will leave this place.
<name/>, you might think I am joking, but am very serious "If you get me a place just .........."
Pass my regards to <name/>, <name/> and anyone else who may recognize me. If you ever come across surgeon say *hei> to him and tell him to write to me.
So long dear
Feel loved and wanted

We must have been so crazy and we thought we were just playing <slang/>coz I miss you <slang/>babie and I've got those feelings again. I guess am so confused about you *infact> have been so in love. You also know, than what can I do? have been thinking about you. Days have passed without us communicating. May I hope and trust this has not changed anything between us.
Thank you for the missive + card which I received early May. I was extremely happy. Everything is okay here only the obvious which you know better is out of my reach. I miss you *alot>. However we must learn to survive better. Sorry for the delay. The agony of remoteness has ever knocked me down by making me the looser.
Well, There is so much work around. <ea/>Kanawa is now at climax so bear with me. All the same nothing <slang/>wonna change my love for you, if anything I promise never to part you under whatever *circustances>. <name/> DO YOU MISS ME? So tell me anything of late. *Infact> have reached a point of no return so  its><+_it's> you and you or death. I care for you in times of Joy and Sorrow.

That's the kind of love I need from you <slang/>pliz. Now look here, things don't just happen out of the blues. There's always a reason behind it. So I mean God has good plans for both of us. Plans for prosperity and not for harming us. Plans to give us hope and future. (Jer. 29: II)
About the photo I can't enclose now since  its><+_it's> not available now. So chill and cool for Now.

Dear <name/>
How's you since the last sight? Hope's fine and well groomed under God's care. Here we are all fine and well, going on smartly with our day to day's work.
My main gist is only to say a word of hi and thank you for your remembrance. The plucking here has reached to climax but our coffee is not all that much. The weeding I am still going on with it. but it is not a large portion left.
I applied for a vacancy in Rwika and the other institute I was telling you but no reply. For now I am cool at home waiting for what shall come next. I filled those forms for college but everything I have laid into the hands of the Lord.
Mine <slang/>bro is only to go on my knees and pray for you for the job you said you are about to secure. Maybe our *almight> God will bless you and <slang/>thro' you we might be uplifted. We might turn around and lift our eyes to the mountains to seek our help but let us know our help come from our Lord. Since he has promised us a bright future full of hope (Jer 29: II) let us wait for it patiently.
I don't have much to tell but let me wish you the best as you finish your course. let me hope to meet soon with good news. In case you go to <name/>'s place greet her and tell her I am still waiting for her promise.
Yours <slang/>sisy

<I >Mrs <name/>,
Always in the chase, this is <name/>, with me always in the dark and in the light. <slang/>Babie, how are you? Do you guess the way I am missing you? Never! Surely sure your absence is killing me. Better now I have recovered from the shock! And this me again on my 42nd day of RRRof loneliness.
Sweet heart how are you? Beyond doubts I believe that Nice one is fine pretty and beautiful as ever. And I can <slang/>'c' you walking smartly ..... Here My sweet things a cool having clenched the teeth for weeks. For weeks I wept in silence waiting for a collapse. I waited for  you><+_your> letter so long. Worried as you can't imagine days shifted into nights of dream each with  it><+_its> own dream. I even thought of coming back there to confirm. Seriously!
Most serious even is the fact that I was so depressed that I went to hospital. Acid was killing me. The doctor was so clear. You need no doctor he said Our prescription is nothing but to go and see your sweet one that was Monday 22nd Just UUUanticid saw me in the next day *tuesday> 23rd after a sleepless night so depressed just helpless friends were getting worried but I knew it better In the afternoon thank God I received your letter........
<name/>, tell me what I will have to do. Madly in love big distance between us may one day kill me. Remember Romeo in the play Romeo and Juliet. I confess I am completely in your skin. So confused I don't know what to do! If you are EVER TO SAY NO! please kill me first. Your future is my future your present is my present and forgotten is our past for soon heaven carols will open to our heaven. <slang/>Pliz make my dream true, my life life.
Worry not my sweet, I am so strong onhand with books but your silence, absence, would have done me a dry wood. I was so happy very happy to read a nice *reassurence> from you my dear. It brought back my heart beat a breath and life. I was so worried, confused, I wondered what wrong I had *commited>. That letter took rather to long to reach you and the post office was likely to drive me nuts. I now understand and this the pain to bear the poor communication especially delay of these letters. Thanks for writing promptly <slang/>pliz it saved thousand seams. Good soothing message thanks My dear. God's plans for us - a bright future = together as one.
How was your birthday party. I wish I was near you at these wonderful moments. How many candles you blow. I wish your letter had arrived earlier at least I would have sent a card if not a tiny present. Don't worry next time I will be there and the next and the next and the next and for ever. A wonderful time I hope it was!
We are starting end of the Semester Exams on 12th June to 24th. I would have come home on 22nd but I will have to attend an Extra-<O/> class that Thursday at 5.30 - 7.00 pm hence I promise to be at Keris from 2-4pm on Friday 23rd of June. If you will have time <slang/>pliz meet me there but if not possible mind not my dear; I will see you on 24th <slang/>Sat or Sunday 25th. <ea/>Ama? 25th fifth is our day <slang/>pliz dawn - doom. Think about it. So from 24th - 29th we will have fantastic times. Why do circumstances always beat us. We are so unfortunate that everytime our dates are always spoilt by unwanted *interfearances>. This time Juliet we'll have to strive to move earth and heaven to make ourselves valours over circumstances. We will have a day full and I suggest 25th. A day of opening hearts. 
For now sweet one since I can't write, all that I may want for the more I write the more I suffer loneliness I will stop here. And <slang/>pliz feel no guilt for whatever my circumstances were during communications short-comings. I understand the situation which we will have to bear. Farewell Sweetie it is You or Never. YOU OR NEVER, I say. I CARE SO <slang/>PLIZ DON'T BE CARELESS.
Romeo found and forever yours

Dear <name/>
Much and cordial greetings are forwarded to you at this momental juncture! How are you since my last sight as well as departure. Hope things are cool and fine as they are on my side. On my side I am *okey> although things are going astray.
I received your massive sometimes February and I was delighted to read it. *Infact> as you said you have broken the silence even me I agree with you. Anyway I don't know what I can tell you <slang/>coz I am totally confused. I was at home on 8th March of which I counted it as a mess. Imagine going home without a plan. Anyway I made it although it wasn't what I expected. I met the little girl with all the mess!! I did the work of cooking for those who were removing maize from the <ea/>shamba for three days.
I felt challenged <slang/>coz of the question you had asked me about the <ea/>Kibarua. We filled the form for permanent but let me assure you that right now nothing is confirmed of us being employed. The reason behind it we can't even tell. So far what I have planned now is that by August if things wont change I swear I will think of better things. I have already talked with another person to teach me how they go about with business. I am starting my business that month. I won't <coin/>terrorate again. I swear even <ea/>Timau was better. We are not even paid well. I have 2,000 in my <coin/>posta right now but I hope God will do miracles by August.
The whole idea of attending college *infact> I won't make it. Because money has brought everything in a mess. So let me try that business of selling fruits, and cereals if possible. If there is assistance or your opinion toward that decision please inform.
But for sure I  wont><+_won't> work in mastermind. For the year which I have worked I have counted it as a total loss of which I  dont><don't> know who will help to compensate me. 
Greet your friends. Nice RRRtyme. Please reply I look forward waiting for your decision
I met my <slang/>sisy <name/> at Keria. When I was returning back. If all goes well we shall all meet at the end of August at home for we have arranged to go and see <name/>'s child. I don't know if <name/> has arranged well but we talked when I was on hurry but I will write to her to confirm about it.
<slang/>Tiz guy 
I hope God will help you to finish your college well and prosper for better life. Goodbye till we meet. But please reply so that I will be able to know more about that plan.

My Darling Bro,
May the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Love of God the father and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you always. We're all fine and its my anticipation that you're fine too.
Sorry for the delay, actually I received your letter three days after you sent it. It was very clear that your journey back to school was very safe as far as safety was concerned.
Now the gist of this small document is to notify you that as you may be knowing I've got 1000£ from our Aunt <name/>. I <O/> to send that money immediately I got it but when I talked with <name/> about how you went back, he was very sorry <slang/>coz he had promised you something, now he requested me to wait until when he is ready and it is today. He gave me 10750£.
<name/> I found that since you'll be coming on 16th Dec, ie next Saturday I don't see the need for sending this money within one *weak>, it's risky. Otherwise you'll get it when you come. So I owe you KSh 2000£. If <name/> asks about it, please tell him I sent and you *recieved> it.
Otherwise <name/>, Mum has been sick for a couple of days but now she is alright, all the others are all, well and healthy. Expect stories when you come home for Christmas.
For now I'm sleepy and I think I should retire for bed. Everybody else in this house is sleeping. May God bless you my darling brother. I'm sure we worship the true God who lives and reigns forever and ever. He will see us through all those  earths><+_earth's> hardships and he will never let us down.
*Recieve> much greetings from all <name/>' and <name/>. <name/> was to write you a note but then you see he's so committed so he told me to write on his *behave> and tell you that he could have given you more than what he has given but due to much financial problem ie lack of money, accept what you've got; he's ready to give hand next time where assistance would be needed.
<name/> I end hoping to see you soon. God bless you and all your undertake.
 Its><+_It's> with love

Dear <name/>,
It is with a lot of Pleasure and Pressure that I set my weak hands on this paper. I am actually more confused than confusion itself.
I take no time to declare myself fine and it's my sincere prayer that you are doing better than a fiddle.
Dear, after reading your critical words I sincerely felt like never before. I cannot really explain it here on this paper but I know how guilty I'm feeling to date. To be sincere I'm only longing for the day we shall meet in an environment of our own convenience. Only then, 'may be' we can restore our trust in each other. 
When I imagine the distorted figure you have in your mind about me, I really feel unfair both to myself and to you.
Will you ever forgive me?
Your ambivalence left me with a lot of nostalgia and I would like to capitalize on this until we meet once more for a better moment than we had. I mean with not so many "commercial breaks" from our many friends.
When you talk of 'self pity', I feel like I am not worthy living <slang/>coz why should I and why had I to put you in such a state. I know I was about to 'strip' you or *may be> I did but Please Brother can't you understand that I'm just a loyal *descedant> of 'EVE'? And no 'ADAM' was wise enough to take a second thought. Now play the role of God and forgive me since I have suffered enough from guilty consciousness since the betrayal scene.
You talked of a short holiday up to the 25th March. If it would be possible consider our meeting once more in the village after the 2nd. I shall arrive in the village in the evening of the 2nd and so *may be> we could meet on third. I hope that I am not imposing so much on you. I also hope that my message does not sound very strange. *May be> it is the most you would expect from such a nut.
Instead of begging for *forgivenness> on the paper I would rather face you dear. POOR ME.
I was glad to see our Ironical images close together. Thank you for the copy. Please don't always see a nut in me. It was just a human error and you will come to understand it if you would really love to assist me get out of this state of dilemma.
Hurting you or betraying you for a second time will be the worst you'll receive from me. I hope I will keep to my words.
Otherwise trust me and I trust you. Let's try to forgive the past if we can't forget. I know it hurts but it' happened.
I can only say that I like your innocence. To avoid more tautology I stop here with a hope of seeing you then. I've always loved your company.
May the Lord bless His innocent people.
Greet 'our' friends.
bye.

You are dizzed that always I chase you 
I am no less crazy <slang>'coz'got no *explaination> 
I may be numb, skirtly in my flimsy voice 
Either do I have reason to offer you 
Because love is the only *explaination>
And the *explaination> is Love.
To say I Love you is the worst banality
To wish I had language unique to us two
Spoken by no other because emotions surpasses
Bloody neptual *meaninglesses>  youve><you've> heard too
But have no other way to express specially
So like they and yet unlike them its killing Love
Do ask I not why because I know not
Worried I am that the trailing may be bug bear
Pardon me always <slang/>'coz' my love is eternal
Shaken and wordless my eyes and hears wear
Because you caged me and so drug me to death
And will care not whether  its><+_it's> love or mere drug
I seek *symphathy> if love is long taken
I couldn't mind shams and the prelénces
For its blessing to be killed by angels
To follow to the dark alleys yet no questions
Confessingly before you am water a sure vacuum
And the reason is Love and Love the reason
And now to you God: why create the imperfections?
If not so then, why do I fumble dry mouthed?
Why don't you touch the heart or let I touch her flimsily?
OR even let me breath even the state breath out from her
I do not think of kill oh Lord; it just an accidental bumping
A kiss from this Angel may kill me I the mortal man
I am confused openly I say and Loudly
I implore you Love just see me cry and Look!
I just beg you for a good kick on my brut only
And I swear satisfied I will walk a blessing it could be
OR just give me a brutish insults; they will soothe me
And satisfied will I walk away because of Love

Forwardly, I'd to take this chance to thank our dear everlasting Supreme God, Jehovah, under whose will *will> are living. It's not a mere chance that we're Living, but we greatly owe it to His undeserved kindness, hence He need to abide by his will. In addition, I'd like to convey my heart felt greetings to you and friends from me. On my part, I'm superbly O.K. healthily, physically and emotionally save for the usual academic environment, as you are conversant with.  Its><+_It's> my optimistic wish and hope that you're likewise quite well under Jehova's protective arm.
Here at Moi,  were><+_we're> yet gaining or rather gearing towards full-throttle momentum of our respective academic tasks, which is bound to extend to late July, provided that all the vital factors experience the slightest alteration, if any. By then, we'll call it a day to our first academic year. While, for your part, may I felicitate you very much for having made it to your final year, and you will bear me witness that, the final lap of the 8.4.4. Education System has been a very demanding, if not taxing, endeavour. Owing to many obstructions, many have opted to yield in to the pressures and consequently, ceases to accomplish their education (higher). In fact, at *once> *ocassion>, Jesus *OM> His disciples that, he who perseveres to the end will be saved. So, I hail you proficiently for your remarkable courageous and spirited academic fight. Keep it up in future!
Similarly, my advice to you is to put much more effort to take in the accurate knowledge of God Jehova, which leads to eternal Life Jh 17:3. Probably, I might not have another chance to visit your residence at the campus since you're winding up your dear program and hence your last Semester and academic year, in your undergraduate Studies, *a hend> of us. On my side, I thank you very profusely for the kind hospitality and loving manner you extended to me and in company of my friends in the past, when we/I called at your place. Please do maintain it high!
My roommates send you much greetings. <name/> told me that, when he called at your room, he slept at Nairobi although he failed to make it to your room again. All in all, all are O.K. It's my wish that I will attend your graduation Ceremony later in this year, if God wills. I hadn't received any communication yet from home, although I'd written to them last week, but I hope they're O.K.
Meanwhile, I'm having a mild problem and I wanted to request for some financial "soft loan" if you will be in a position to do so. Actually, I hadn't received any money from home because someone revealed it to my dad my balance which I received from HELB. Also, during first semester, I'd incurred some debt of 5000£ from Someone and I'd to repay it, besides paying for *accomodation> and <slang/>specs, the latter costing me 3000£. Actually, all those expenses reduces my loan. For your, loan, if it will be available, I promise to refund it after this Semester. If possible, it would be sufficient if you can manage 2000£ please! So, please I look <OM/> to hear from you.
Lastly, but not the least, I hope to meet you in the near future <slang/>thro' God's will. May Jehova bless you to complete your degree program around July. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
bye!
Forbid flaws *iff> any please!
Yours' Sincerely,

<O/> dear <name/>
it was a place which I can't identify in real life. There were several people sitting together inside of a small room. Apart from you, my brother and myself, I don't remember who the others were. The duet "Endless Love" was playing in the background and everyone was fascinated by the female voice on the song. But no one, apart from my brother and me, knew that the female singer of the song was sitting right there in the room with us.
When I told them that it was you who had sung "Endless Love", they all expressed their disbelief and paid you lots of *complements>. Half-pleased and half *embarassed> you acknowledged their *complements> with giggles, laughter and tears. Strangely enough, tears of blood as well as normal tears rolled down your face in the same stream.
Suddenly, a vehicle pulled up in front of the small room. Up you stood and out you went. The vehicle, a little sportscar with some young gentlemen inside, had come to pick you up and take you home. By this time, everyone had <AM/>gotten out of the room so as to have a look at the vehicle which had stopped in front of the room.
It so happened that I had lately been out of town and you and I had not seen each other for quite some time. And in the room we had not had any time on our own to talk. So I tried to have a word with you just before you had to get into the car, but we could not talk because my brother was standing there.
Noticing that you still wanted to talk to someone, the young gentlemen drove on a little distance to wait for you a short way from where we were standing. Then you put your arm around me as we ran together in the direction of the car, hoping to steal a moment and do the talking. But much to our disappointment, my brother was still following us.
At this point I found myself in a totally different place. The dream had changed altogether. Not long after this, I woke up and started to wonder why I had been dreaming like that. I found that the song "Endless Love" had actually been playing on the radio beside my bed.
This song was originally sung by Lionel Richie and Diana Ross and recently re-sung by Luther Vandross and Mariah Carey. It was the recent version of the song that I had been hearing while I had been sleeping.
On the bedroom wall is a breathtaking picture of Mariah Carey. Each time I'm in Nakuru and have a chance to look at it, I think of you with great *nostalgia. From the dangling hair to the mixed-breed facial features to the petite body, Mariah Carey looks very very like you. No wonder in my dream "Endless Love" was sung by Luther Vandross and <name/>.

<O/> dear <name/>,
Everyone has got their own sorrows. Some people have got bigger sorrows than yours. Others have smaller sorrows than yours. But everyone deals with their sorrows in a different way.
Like everyone, you have got your own sorrows - some of which you have told me about. But often I'm amazed at the way you deal with your sorrows. To an ordinary person, you appear to have no sorrows at all.
You have so much confidence in yourself; you are so satisfied with yourself; you believe in yourself; you take life so easy and you have so much happiness in your life.
Sometimes I feel as if you should have been the first-born in your family. You could be a very good leader of the others. Unlike other leaders, you are in control of your own life, and you have such a sense of responsibility.
I have once watched your elder sister talk at you, and you had to politely listen to her. Even though you may be more "mature" than her, you had to listen to her because in the family she's *superiour> to you by age.
There are many educated people who are stupid. And there are many uneducated people who are clever. There are some things which are just not learned from books.
Compared to some people, you did not have so much education. But often I'm amazed at how much knowledge you have of the world. That knowledge makes you a better performer in life than more educated people - and that is what really matters.
To your children you are such a good mother; to <name/> you've been such a good wife; to your relatives you are such a good daughter-in-law / sister-in-law and to me you are such a good friend.
Sometimes I feel like you've got a natural degree in human relations. You know the art of dealing with people better than almost anyone I know. I could give endless examples of how I have been impressed by your good human relations, but I'll give only two.
At times I have reacted very angrily to you - how I regret it!! - but you surprised me by the way you responded. An average person would have responded with anger, but you responded with friendliness. Today I owe our friendship to you; without your God-given knowledge of human relations, you and I might not be friends today.
If you had the same temperament as <name/>, then the two of you would have separated long ago. As you can imagine, no other woman would live with him the way you have. Whether he realizes it or not, he owes your marriage to you; without your God-given knowledge of human relations, you might not be husband and wife today.
Of course, you have got your own faults, but that's natural and normal. No one is perfect. Only God is perfect. No matter what somebody else might say about you, you are the nearest thing to a perfect person that I have ever known. You should be proud of yourself.

You told me that you love to read letters, so let me take this opportunity to express myself just a little bit on this piece of paper.
I know that the fact that I made up my mind (a long time ago) to do this exam is probably not the fairest thing to do. But then again, it is something that I took time to decide about, and furthermore, I think  its><it's> too late to change my mind now. Ever since I was young, I have always believed in doing my level best in anything. I struggle a lot <name/>, because I am not exactly gifted academically compared to many. I have had to work day & night for very long to catch up on Kanji. (Just like I hardly sleep during exam time in Day Star.) Please understand that I am only doing some thing that I really really want to do from the very bottom of my heart. I intend to do it the best I can. But that does not mean anything. You are the best in Kanji in JACII so I wonder why you are so ... I don't know. If you believe in doing your best then you'll surely be able to thank God for whatever happens. I have always believed that success does not lie in being the best, but doing your best.
This isn't competition. It is only testing our abilities.
I like you you know. I think you are extremely as imaginative + hence you shall get far in life. I can assure you that one.
All the best on Saturday. Make sure you come so that we pray together before the exam. Let our good God take control.
*Blessyou,>

Hello, and thanks for your long awaited letter which I got yesterday. Actually I was very happy to receive from you, and I really felt flattered by your lovely poem. Thanks for *you> compliments,  its><+_it's> good to hear that someone on this globe cares! Well about the trip to UUUUbs&Hila, I think it is worth it. And I think any of the weekends in *october> would be *favouable> but not the weekend that falls on the 5th of <slang/>oct, because I have an appointment on that day.
By the way how do I trace you while am in Nrb? I have been coming almost every weekend, but neither <name/> nor <name/> know how you can be traced. So in your next letter, before we meet, please write down directions of how I can reach you.
I'm also very sorry to learn about your  friends><+_friend's> death. It also saddening to learn it was a suicidal one. At times I wonder, how many <slang/>p'ple out there are battling emotionally within themselves, with no one to confide in! It really is sad if only people could reach out to each other, what a heavenly place this world would be!!
At times I count myself lucky, to have <slang/>p'ple like you around. Even though we haven't been together much, I still know at the back of my mind, that in case of anything that may happen to me, I have a shoulder to cry on, a place to run to and an ear to listen to me, a voice to comfort me, and a smile to warm my heart & dune away my tears. And that someone is YOU. Thanks so much for everything & I hope to see you pretty soon.
I'm intending to frame your poem,  its><+_it's> very very beautiful & soothing - THANKS!! Thanks.

Hello, and how are you? I do hope you are fine.  Am also fine and grateful for your calls. Am sorry, we haven't met, due to circumstances beyond our reach. But I know one day/weekend we will be together!!!
Well I got a job, and I must say  its><+_it's> quite *intresting> and I just love it! I've witnessed so many things and a lot of court cases some which have touched me. At least now I know or rather I have a rough idea of what to expect from the legal field in Kenya.
How is <name/>? Does he know  am around? Pass my regards to him. If only we could plan a one day trip to UUUHola! Or what do you say? Remember  am only free on Saturday and Sundays.
Please write and  lets><+_let's> organize this trip, may be even *upto> Mombasa. Do you know anyone there? If you are free, tell me the total costs so that I get organized, and *may be> we can even take a few photographs. You know, *this> are the moments we will have to remember!! Or what do you think?
Mum and everybody here are all fine. I only went to your place, and I haven't gone back, but if I get time, I'll pay them another surprise visit. I hope I'll get your dad this time.
Then give me <name/>'s address in your next letter.

Dear <name/>
Hello, and thanks very much for you letter which I received on 10-7-95. Well indeed I was glad to read from you, though in a way it left me quite baffled and worried. Your letter really portrayed some sort of sadness and loneliness you felt within you, and my being away even made you feel so distanced and alone. Sincerely <name/> I feel so heartbroken and I even wish I was there to fill the gaps you feel within you. Because if there is anyone who deserves happiness --  its><+_it's> you!
Well I do have many things to share with you. Both my anxieties & dreams, and even to share with you all the happy memorable moments I have experienced, and sad ones too. And of course I would also have to hear the same things from you now. And I know in a way we will. It doesn't matter when, but I believe we will.
Why did you say, you find the world a strange place to live in? and Why  is><+_are> you thinking so much different from <slang/>p'ple? Remember, the world in a way is what you make of it. Though in a way, the world may re-model us against our wish, or what do you say?
I promised to be with you in Nrb, but due to *afew> commitments I can't make it, I ought to have travelled to shags, but Mum is still financially committed, hence I have to wait till End month. On the other hand, am supposed to travel to Eldoret on the 21st of July, to see <name/>'s husband, then after that I may come to Nairobi.
Dear, I really miss you and I believe we will be able to catch up even *upto> the tiniest details of what has been happening in our *lifes>. And has you will agree with me, all this can't be discussed in an hour - It needs time. And this time we surely will get!!
I really have to pen-off and thanks a <coin/>thillion for your UUUconceive
Bye <slang/>'n' God bless you
Yours "Our dreams can come true,
if we only believe
Our hopes can never fade
if we only believe"
Oh by the way, has anyone ever told you, you are the most gentle & caring & considerate and thoughtful person God ever created and brought further in 3/8/72? <slang/>Congrats!!
W1B-SK28
<name/> dearest,
If I could have captured that enchantment, that rare feeling that gripped me deep inside my mortal being; if I could only show you dearest angel, in ways true to express, the elation, the felicitous blissful feeling that totally engulfed my core, swallowing me in its sweetened depths yet at the same time lifting me to this dizzying zenith where one remains happy (as I) as the day is Long; If only I could save it for you, you'd surely know how much I treasure a mere word from you.
As I write this, I swear tears flow from my eyes. Don't ask me why angel for it doesn't matter. Somehow it feels right otherwise I wouldn't even let them flow. Oh bluemoon I wish I could reach out and feel you; gaze into your clear large honest eyes; that I could give you one hell of a bear hug!! May be you don't believe me but I sure as hell mean it.
Angel words fail me and the distance between us unnerves me. God knows how much your letter sparked in me. Since <name/> pissed me off, more than 21/2 years ago, I thought I never would feel like this. It's like a part of me numbed and died with her rejection, then God sends me a note from an angel I thought I'd never hear from again, showing me just how much there still is to live for. <name/>, your letter never arrived at a more opportune time.
By the way just how did you know <name/> did me out? And who misinformed you that I do camel chores?
I hope I don't sound angered <slang/>'coz I'm not the least bit irked. The truth is I've never been anywhere near a camel, nor do I harbour any such intentions. Rather I'm sure you'd believe me, I've been doing things that have taught me a lot. I've been to college, printing in Poly, through certificate level for a year but then changed my mind, thick as usual, of course. 
I used to go to college three days a week usually from <slang/>tues through to *thursdays> then back to Narok to help-out Ma and Pa at the 'little but big' "cafe <foreign/>cum hotel" that we ran from '92 to '95 Where unfortunately I picked up some really really stupid habits all of which I'll tell you later. So, after 3 years of pure and absolute hell, we decided it wasn't worth it and called it a day especially so for this pot-bellied uncle (dad's father) of mine who just can't do without food and beer. Though he hides his true motives from those who don't know him he sure is a big stupid fellow who loves to resemble one of those big shots who say (life ain't nothing without bitches and beers) God what a bum good for nothing uncle I have! He went once on a drinking spree on <slang/>dec of '95 precisely on X-mas and ended up having a brawl with one of my pals whom he called names and accused of stalling his  parents><+_parents'> Dry cleaning facility (i.e. my pal) with his (my pal's) ways, while actually it was the mother who was siphoning money out of the business and *samandering> it. Anyway he received nasty answers from this angry pal that resulted in him being given a sound refreshing thrashing to remind him about his manners. Can you believe angel that he came running to me to avenge for him, that I as his nephew had to conform and abide by his command? That's what he told me and I not being the <name/> you once knew had all of such pent-up *supressed> rage that I couldn't *controll> anymore. I told him off with his f---ing breath saying "up with your meaty a--!" Forgive me angel such obscenities I don't usually love to use in my choice of words. After that he stays away from me and believe me I hold no regrets to this day. That's the same uncle who wanted to beat mum in *may> of that same year and I nearly <O/> him but for mom's intervention. He is the same guy who wanted pa to give him the Hotel and wouldn't stop at anything. He is the reason, apart from other equally destructive reasons that we called it a day. Today we run several rooms in a kind of lodgings 'Masaai' or is it spelled 'Maassaaai'(?) "Manyatta's" -> concrete to be exact. Since pa retired 3 years ago he runs them while I simply wilt and decay.
I say so <slang/>'coz angel, I ain't as I was. Things change and I am no exception. I'm sure I'm not the same old, tall handsome <name/> you knew five years ago. Though I am just as tall, (I hardly notice though) I do things I hate to, like smoking and chewing too much as if trying to fill a void I can't understand. I hardly sleep at night usually staying awake till weird hours (4, 5 am) then sleep up to Midday. I still write things but since I have no one to share them with I forget where I place most of them.
I really hate this <slang/>kinda life. I look forward to nothing remarkable and get nothing special in return. I don't know what to do nor what I want. I don't know if I am actually depressed or lonely or *desparate> or whatever. However all I know since I got your letter an hour ago is that I truly wish I was near you. Just talking to you would do me a world, <slang_>nay helluva lotta<slang/> goodness.
Anyway even though I have no serious problems like hunger and extreme poverty, still I don't like the emptiness, the sort of despirited existence of my present position.  Am torn between things like staying at home wasting away or trudging off to some place or other seeking work and being independent leaving my loving parents alone. I know that if I stay here I am sort of secure enough when it comes to issues such as emotional support etc but then I don't really know if I am strong enough to go out and face the world on my own away from my parents. I don't know for sure what's the best option.
Enough about my problems. But before I inquire about yours apart from Marriage and all that, I may as well tell you about my 'once one and only'.
She graduated in Jan this year with a diploma in Earth Sci. and even got her picture in the papers hugging her mum. I wasn't jealous, I actually felt sort of mesmerised and contented since it seems even though I may have failed where she succeeded, it added weight to the idea of "I can make it too" if she did. Anyway she proceeded to conduct a fundraising that proved a complete success raising over a million shillings then flew off to Indiana. I never attended the fundraiser nor did I see her off though I wrote her a small crumpled note asking forgiveness and urging her on to pursue her dreams with the zeal and strength that she naturally possessed.
Sincerely angel I wish for her what she deserves. She's sort of fiercely independent and stubbornly decisive once she makes up her mind on anything and she's sort of bluntly honest about things.
Do you remember a guy one class behind us in school called <name/>? I can't recall the other name but I do recall they lived opposite NAC and he had a short figure, almost comical. I do hope you remember <slang/>'coz <name/>'s bambino was sort of related to him. A sort of smart fellow with them riches and all. I met him the very first day they went to Narok to hang in a Club owned by <name/>'s father i.e. in mid-June 1993. It was a *friday> and I had informed <name/> in college where we rarely saw each other, that I won't be going home for the week-end but I got sent by my grandma (the one I lived with in Buru) to Narok. Upon arrival late at around 10pm I was chewing with some buddies when one suggested we take a look around the only joint in town and you can guess the rest considering everyone knew <name/> was my girl. It was sparsely crowded but not enough to hide anyone or anything. Supposedly they came in a group about 5 guys and <name/> and we were about 15-20 guys all pals of mine, I mean really close pals. I found <name/> openly flirting care-freely with this very very handsome bambino called <name/>.To this day I vividly recall the pain I felt, the traumatic shock, the shame and the betrayal. She did all sorts of things to him, some of which I can't really bring my-self to tell. Angel, it was like watching porno things I watch to this day and actually like. Now now I hope you aren't disgusted by me, I'll tell you why later.
My cronies got pissed off and all worked up especially <slang/>'coz *this> guys from MTC thought <slang/>'coz they had the bitch whose father owned the place they reckoned they could show us what they really could do. You know, sort off they can kick some ass or something like that. Imagine I had to hold back my pals or a war could have exploded. I really couldn't wreck havoc to their party. I figured I wouldn't fight for <name/>, not for the way she behaved like a bitch in serious need of a good *bonking> from really handsome Romeo with blue-green eyes called <name/> for I just couldn't give it to her well enough. Yes angel <name/>, that's why I never really mattered, I couldn't do it to her. Once she even told me she was the one who actually fuc--d me! I'm not spicing it all up, that's exactly how she put it. She never even listened to my side of the problem if indeed there was any in the first place. Before that I *though> ladies of her kind hated men who made their intentions very clear (blow-job). I thought a true sincere relationship between unmarried couples with enough morals to keep their wits around them never indulged in *camal> commitments. But I was wrong and I paid for it. Not that I never felt turned on or horny by her, only that I tried to keep it decent and good. Well whatever I wrote about good guys ending up nowhere except hang from crosses to die actually is true. <name/> proved too big for my pants in *infront> of my pals. Today or rather nowadays I actually watch blue movies and do some things you'll hate me for if I ever told them to you.
Anyway that's about all. I am sickened just thinking about these things. I'll tell you everything when I see you. I want you to give me your telephone contact to let you know when  am there.
<name/> dropped out or was sort of discontinued by the old man for sneaking out of school on several *occasins> to Nakuru. Today she is married with one boy and lives in Moshi tiz where she and her husband run a Shoe Shop. I hear from her *regurlarly> since she went in mid '93. 
Anyway that's just about all. Please reply soon and tell me about how you live, who you live with, why you left NAS, when were you in Nakuru last, what <name/> is doing, who do you see from our class, how come you don't want to work in Nakuru, where's <name/> and all the rest. I'm waiting impatiently, and I usually think about you a lot especially on the past five Valentines when reaching most of your letters, I promise I'll make a point of seeing you.
With deep sincere Affections and Love.
Bluemoon.
Please excuse my poor handwritting.
Angel let me pen away, off or afar (??) My fingers feel athnitic and my pens (changed them three times so far) and I believe you'd begin to feel as though you've just gone through a letter that almost nears the <O/> thing - remember?? And that's the least I want to be compared with - like ="<name/> was a man of few words" = Only that I don't seem so no more!!
Anyway angel one last thing: I've always loved you, and will do so exactly for who you are and however others might think of you. I truly treasure your affectionate attitude towards those you care for and I'll never forget your husky sounds and merry laughter during that one short year that we met. I always think about you especially so when I read my <O/> diary and to this day my conscience pricks me for not sharing more with you. I beg and hope it ain't too late now.
I love you Bluemoon Angel.

Dear <name/>,
*Hallo>! It was so exciting to come to the office this morning - and to find your letter. I had the feeling that somebody had written - somebody who matters to me - but I didn't know who. You see vehicles (PSU) have been on strike so I couldn't go to college yesterday. Otherwise I'm all fine in every way. Just so happy to hear from you. Well, nothing much has been happening here. There was so much silence in campus until the first year students came on Sunday the 25th April. Since the old students (SDAs) were away, I had to organize the putting up of posters and making sure they knew where to meet on Wednesday evening (28th April). All that went fine. I spoke to them in the evening of "GROWING UP ONTO JESUS' LIKENESS." The basic text was *Phillipians> 1-6, 9-11, but I also dwelt on other verses like the beautiful 2 Pet 318. You see, many of the people who register as SDAs in their first year later drop out of fellowship because of the allurements of campus life. We therefore had to tell them that
"for every temptation and incentive to sin, a divine remedy is provided in the gospel that is the power of God under Salvation... In the pursuit of holiness we look to Jesus Christ more and more, until the last sin has been conquered, until all bias to sin is wholly eradicated." All of us were encouraged with the message, and many people showed they had understood what the message of the hour was by continually repeating the slogan
IN CAMPUS CHRISTIANITY MAKES SENSE!
and it sure does, everywhere
Living the adventist lifestyle brings God into every moment of every day, whether one is shopping, studying for an exam... A seven-day-a-week religion will cause us to see in every detail of life something that leads us to think of Christ and His plan for us... <quote_><quote/>
(*Paulien>, 1990)
Yet, dearest <name/>, the devil still continually stalks us! The disciplines tell us <quote_><quote/> (1 Pet 2.12).
We are also <slang/>s'posed to be good examples to those within the fold. By the grace of God, I will be an EXAMPLE, even as I behold the GREAT EXEMPLAR, Jesus Christ. Yet, sometimes we become the object of gossip, the object of depiction, the subject of unholy discussion among people who profess godliness but deny the power thereof. Like the ones who read evil intentions in the fact that I at times attend the worship service with the students, that I visit them, that I have Christian friends everywhere... it sometimes makes me a bit uncomfortable and very lonely. Only Jesus keeps me on an even keel... Sometimes I've had to bear with so much - even from among those of the faith.
When you tell me you've been going <slang/>thro' the worst stretch in your life in recent weeks, I know what it could mean, I know the long hours that drag lazily on, I know the pall that so darkly lingers Eating away at the pilgrim's root of happiness, Bidding you swallow the bitter gall: I know, I know.
The *wity> deceiver delights at hushing darts
Wounding and tearing some faithful soul,
He loves the sick to make sicker,
the faint to make fainter
To fill the smoothest skin with wants...
Jesus knows the battles we fight every day, for He's always out there in the ring, receiving every butt, swallowing every bitter herb we are made to swallow. Remember Jesus suffered in the flesh, and has experienced everything that we experience...<name/>,
somebody just told me that he heard some people *gossipping> about me and I feel so down because of that. Something utterly unimaginable - can you imagine me moving with somebody's wife?
it is symptomatic of our people's failure at relationships - with God and with our fellow humans - that the major sources of misunderstanding between people start from there - at RELATIONSHIP AVENUE. Frankly, I'm sick of being scandalized and gossiped about, being cannibalized and having to keep quiet, to suffer patiently because it is below my dignity and thinking to discuss something as base as what I have told you above... That is why I had rather find somebody lovely and ready to bear the burdens of life with us - that is why I had rather have you organize a meeting between the two/three of us for an opening <foreign/>tête-á-tête.
I think you should give me her contacts - both postal and telephone, so that we can have some communication going on. <name/> is somebody I feel positively inclined to know more about, somebody that a relationship with can be something fulfilling in every way. Let me have her contacts as soon as possible: I wouldn't mind receiving a one-page letter with nothing but your regards and her contacts. I think it might be difficult for her to write me first. I guess she would feel a little bit awkward. So I have decided to enclose a short letter for her.
You have been such a good sister to me, and I believe you are still going to remain the same. I feel so encouraged just writing to you and hearing from you. Pass my love to all the New Life UUUZoulti family. Miss the whole mob of you big. Please write soonest and all my Love

Dear <name/>,
Hi! What's up? How is life those sides? Us guys here in Moi University are doing fine except for the CATS and assignments which are really doing us in. Have you started your exams? How is your small, sweet sister doing? She is now in standard four, isn't she?
Where did you spend your April <slang/>Hols? I came to your place and bounced really hard. Your old lady told me you had either gone to Nakuru or Mombasa to get a bit of fun. So how were things those sides? I swear I can't wait to hear all the things that happened. My buddies and I went to try another joint in Thika. By the way, have you heard of it? I wouldn't be surprised if you said no <slang/>coz it's a new <slang/>hang. I'm telling you the D.J was just playing the songs we wanted to hear. We danced the whole night <ea/>mpaka by the time morning reached, I could feel my muscles complaining. You should try this joint, after all Thika is not very far. I promise, you won't regret it.
Guess who I met in Carnivere the other day! <name/>. She was with another tough looking man who looked a bit like R. Kelly. I swear I couldn't help looking at him. You know, I always wonder where chicks get such <ea/>mzuri men. Can you imagine what that guy was driving? A red sports car with tinted windows. That guy must be loaded, I just hope he won't turn out to be a hoax like all other men.
By the way, are you still going out with that cute boyfriend of yours? You guys must really be serious, eeh? Just remember that good men are not easy to come by. So <slang/>pliz just stick on to that one.
Sorry, I've got to head now <slang/>coz I have UUUmob work to do in History and Government. I'm telling you it's really bogging me down. I'll check you out next time I'm in Nairobi, so that we can sit and gas. Say a big 'hi' to your <slang/>paras and to all your buddies out there. See you later, <foreign/>Chiao!
Always, 
W1B-SK31
Hello <name/>,
How are you? How are things? Us guys down here are doing fine,  am really sorry I could not reply your letter soonest, <slang/>coz I had *alot> of jobs to finish.
Anyway  /thats><+_that's> that, how was your Easter <O/>. Imagine I went to Mombasa for Easter, (Smile <slang/>pliz) Guess who I was with? You remember that child who used to be so *booring> in our class, nowadays she's not a <ea/>'miro' anymore. So we went there place, we arrived on Saturday morning at 8:00 am in the morning, we slept a bit then woke up at midday, had lunch then off to the beach till in the evening, then guess what? We went to have dinner at Sevena beach hotel, then later went to Mamba Village disco for of course UUUheng.
Anyway I have bored you enough, hey? Where did you guys go to, you talk about going to South Africa right? did you go? am really anxious to know what happened how was it, hey! before I forget Imagine <name/> are no longer hanging out with us, <ea/>ati they only hang out with guys who have mobile Imagine, hey! <ea_>Si ati<ea/>  am bothered I just wanted you to know  whats><+_what's> cooking down here, ooh yes I miss you too and am looking forward to hearing from you. <slang/>Pliz give my love to everyone and a big kiss to him okay. (just kidding)
Lots of <slang/>luv

Dear <name/>,
Hallo! Charming one? How is everything in general? How is life treating you lady of my dream? I can only wish to hope that <name/> isn't against you. On <slang/>ma side I okay swinging academically here in this side of our country and life cooking softly.
<slang/>B4 I proceed any further I have something which I <slang/>wonna you to ponder and meditate about. Should I call it thought for the day or the night? Anyway that will depend on the time of day you will receive this hot line.
<quote_>"<quote/>
That should be the *easter> message coming from your one and only one <name/> calling all the way from Laikipia Campus of Egerton University. By the way dear, how is Nairobi? You guys are so quiet nowadays. *Infact> people have started wonder what befell that university and the way it's known to be riotous. What changes are there to make you so docile?
To hell with riots. How did you spend your Easter <slang/>hols? Guess what! I heard some guys saying that during Easter that the time you can do all the wrongs you aspire to do <slang/>'coz Yesu at that time is nowhere. All you have to do is to time good Friday when he is crucified and do all what you want. Then you withdraw on *easter> Monday when he is due to arise. <slang/>Howz that? Madness <ea/>ama?
Anyway my *easter> was such a bore because I didn't anything to do except to loiter around the compound and to watch  the> T.V. At night is to think about you. Missing your presence each day Oh! how I wish I could lay my hands on you, my lips to seek yours, my chest feeling the heartbeat hidden behind those beautiful breasts. Babe! you are a creature and half. So charming, so *lovable> that I always feel jealous imagining you with another man. *Infact> that would render me helpless. Love me and me only sweetie.
Dear if I mean to write about my love for you I can write a book. In the meantime let us live the way we have always done.
Have a smooth semester and work hard. At the same time TAKE CARE!
Yours good or bad

Dear <name/>,
Much greetings from your Mum. Hope you are doing well there. Here we are all fine and doing good. <name/> and <name/> are doing well at school and even at home. <name/> was here during the holidays and even received your letter when he was here. I told him to come and tell you that there is no need of you coming this way without your return fare because things here are hard with no money. I get a salary of two thousand which is not enough to *catter> for us who are here. I told him if you get money from the shares you sold you can *came> because you will be having money for transport. I will finish my loans in October so my full salary will start coming in November. I received your both letters and I'm glad to hear that you have no problem on the side of money. That is the thing that worries me so much.
How is your sister <name/>? I *had> she went to stay with her father. I get very much worried of her. I did not expect her to go and stay in Thika. I thought she was to stay with mama <name/>. Do you go to see her there. What is her arrangement with her father? Has she got anything to do?
Please, son, if you get some money help your brother <name/> because when he left here I gave him only three hundred for the fare only.
<name/> and <name/> have told me to tell you that when coming this way, you buy them school bags if you will be having money. I told them you are still learning not working. But they insisted that *incase> you have the money.
If you have time and fare please go and see your sister and brother.
I don't have more to tell you now but we are expecting you any time from now. We miss you
May God bless you.
Yours Mum 
W1B-SK34
Dear bro,
It's your sister calling you at this fourth day of March, <O/> trying to break the silence which seems to have taken roots between me and you. Anyway how is you brother <name/>? It's my sincere hope that you are as fine as you ought to be. The same case applies to me here in Muranga.
<slang/>Howz <name/> there in Campo? Life here in this college is hell-oriented. Imagine the kind of work load we are expected to carry high on our shoulders is no joke. The course itself is good but it's very demanding. But all the same we hope to cope with the situation.
Have you received any message from home? To me it seems as if all of you have forgotten me. How can all of you forget me? Or was it some kind of a plan to dump me here and calling it off? <slang/>Bro. sometimes I feel so lonely. Even you, of all the people, you seem to have forgotten your one and only sister. Is the work load so <ea/>kubwa that you can't have time to *jote> just a few lines to keep me going?
All the same, never mind. I will get used eventually to this environment and perhaps develop a positive attitude towards this environment.
Other than the complaints I'm making, I wanted to let you know that the college will close on the 29th of this Month. I do hope you will have <AM/>gotten this letter by then because I'm hoping to see you before I go home. Remember what you promised me in January and never fulfilled. I don't know what reason you will give this time. I know you've already obtained your loan and although you will repay alone, you don't have to chew it alone.
Eat and let's eat is the day's Motto. Even if you don't want to eat with us, I know you 'mama' will get the lion's share. By the way where is she nowadays? That sister-in-law of mine has also rioted to write to me.
Anyway I do hope to see you on that day so that we can have at least a small talk <slang/>b4 I UUU'fika' home. Be prepared with my promise and I think I will be over-joyous. Otherwise struggle hard to accomplish your mission in the <slang/>uni. and do not let <ea/>wanawake dominate your entire syllabus. For now  its><+_it's> bye and God blessings. Keep cool and ride on!
Yours in every good respect,
Sister 
W1B-SK35
Dear <name/>,
It's my hope that you are as fine as I am. The Lord is really the lord of life. In the Holy Scripture, indeed, it is written that, He is the way, truth, and life. That is in the book of John chapter fourteen verse six. *Infact>, if we *abind> by His laws, we shall indeed triumph in the battle we are in against the evil one. In Him and with Him, who is almighty, the omnipotent, omniscient, we will always be fine in every respect, whether physically or mentally.
Otherwise, the Lord is my saviour, and He is seeing me through every academic difficulty. The semester has been so far good without any major tumultuous episodes. Really, I have been, and I am still continuing to enjoy myself in my Physics' class. Actually, we have had a trip to mount Longonot a few days ago. Having never been to those sides before, you can bet that I could have been the most thrilled and excited of all my classmates. I know that, the likelihood of you not to have ever visited those sides is high. Furthermore, if it was that you have gone there, of course you would have told me about it.
The mountain is in the raft of the Great Rift Valley, and near Naivasha town. At the mount's top is a wide hole. From some parts of the crater there is emission of fumes. We really exercised our muscles to make it to the top. No wonder, I was proud of myself as I climbed the mountain, as of course, I was a mountain climber, just like any other reknown Mountain-Climber by virtual of the act of climbing! I hope you will get a chance sometimes to have a similar experience.
All the same, God is the one upon whom we should treasure our hopes and desires. Just as a machine derives its motion from fuel, so should we derive our spiritual vitality from the Saviour who is Jesus.
 Its><+_It's> my hope that your long holiday is, and has been marvellous. Please, let me know more about it.
I am eagerly waiting to *here> more about you soon or *latter>. I really can't tell how happy I will be to receive your letter, let alone reading it.
Cherio! God bless!
Your Friend, 
W1B-SK36
Dear <name/>,
How are you? I hope you are okay. I don't know whether or not I am okay, but then again,  thats><+_that's> beside the point. I hope you are chopping hard because we don't want any more flopping from those sides. By the time you are reading this letter, I hope you will have opened the gift and the card. I have written this letter enough times but I always end up chewing it because I never seem to be able to express myself as eloquently as I would like to.
First, the gift. It is, not a bribe, *incase> the idea has entered your head. I just wanted to get you something really special, because in my whole life, very few people have treated me as nice as you have without expecting anything in return, and I really meant it when <slang/>a said you were a 'mighty good man'. I hope you like it.  Its><+It's> also to make sure you don't forget me in a hurry (Nobody's perfect)
The card has a much longer explanation. I guess I should have given it to you a long time ago but I guess being the spoilt last born I am, I was scared if I did, I'd lose you and now I am really ashamed of myself. The card is a pretty good description of how I feel, but I guess it doesn't have any details. The night when we had that <AM/>fatefull misunderstanding, you accused me of not giving 'us' a chance, but before the incident, I was ready to give us a chance. But after what happened, much as I've tried, I haven't been able to put it behind me or to relate to you in the same way. I wish I could, because I really like you, but I can't. I guess its a problem I have always had. Like when my father was flown in from Zambia after the accident and we went to the Airport to pick him up and he was so thin, and he couldn't walk so he had to be driven in a wheel chair. I could not relate to this new idea of my Dad being how he was and I just started sobbing and I couldn't stop. <name/> thinks my expectations of new are too high but I can't help it. I guess that's just the way I am. I've gone out with quite a number of guys but I can never really get serious with them because somehow I always get disappointed in them. Maybe eventually I'll grow out of it but at this point, I don't think I have and I really don't expect you to understand it.
Knowing you as I do, I know you will try to see this from my point of view I have never in my whole life intended to hurt any guy but I seem to have a trait in me that always does. I hope I haven't hurt you, because you of all people do not deserve it. 
I hope we will always be friends, and if you don't call me or visit me every now and then, I'm going to come to KU and do you some serious injury. I would still like us to talk about this further so please  lets><+_let's> arrange to do that. As for the moment I think I am comfortable with the way the relationship is, (I just wish you wouldn't buy me all this stuff, though I really like it) but I want you to tell me how you feel about it.
Please don't hate me, and don't make me miss you. You will always have a special place in my heart. (I don't tell this to all the guys)
Love 
P.S. You do have an okay chest among other things

Dear <name/>, 
Thanks RRRalot for your letter I received sometime back in January. I am only sorry that I did not reply to it in time since I have been waiting to see if your University letter could come. However so far *upto> now, I have not received it, but be sure that anytime I receive it I will send it to your dad. I have all the details as you indicated in the letter. However most of your year mates have received their letters particularly from Moi and Nairobi.
Congratulations for doing well in your exams and starting the job as early as you did. Take the challenge and learn RRRit as much as you can such that during your *vocations> they can offer you the job again.
I also have a request to make to you and I hope you will not find it so difficult. I did form 4 examinations in 1974 EASCE/EACE in Ngere secondary school Kisumu district but I lost my certificate and even result slip in 1979 when my luggage was stolen in Nairobi. All this time I have forgotten my index no. I am guessing it was 7102026. (1974). Please confirm for me this one if possible, I had written a formal request to the council in 1992, but so far there has been no reply. If there is need for me to write a formal request before you can be allowed to check for me then let me know, then I will write. 
Also I have applied for a post of examinations administration as per the circular which was sent to the heads of secondary schools. I have just sent the application today by speedpost (15/3/94). Let me know whether it has reached. Let me also know when they are short listing for interviews, whether I will have been short listed and the date of the interview. If you know somebody who can assist me get the job, let me know. I can make arrangements to see the person as I know these jobs are very competitive and very many people will apply for them.
Sorry for giving you more than one assignment at the same time. But please assist me, particularly confirming for me that index number. Whenever I am called for an interview it becomes a very big *embarassment> to me. 
Thanking you <+_in> advance

How's you. Hope fine under God's care. <ea_>Upande wa<ea/> <ea_>masomo magumu<ea/> <ea/>hama? On our side everything is alright except much work e.g <ea_>Kuruna Kahawa<ea/>, weeding, etc.
I was glad to receive your letter which you sent <name/> to pass. He brought it on time but to get somebody to pass to you it is a great problem. The postage I heard *it> is too costly it raised from 6/s to 14/s
I got the message which you spoke about, the No for grandfather is <number/> and for my father is No <number/>
For me to go back to school I think it is too late for me but if you give that idea last term when you were at home I think I could go back. 
<quote_><quote/> as he has said in (Jer 29:11)

At home the work of picking coffee is too much coffee is in its maximum (<ea/>kugunda) but we are trying our best with <ea/>mukuru.
All I wish you is happy stay and much guidance from our Almighty God.

Dear <name/>,
I *recieved> your massive about a fortnight ago and I was delighted to read it. How is the (UUUunver) I hope  its><+_it's> all fit after a long break. Here at Nakuru the <ea/>Kibarua is going on *athough> I don't know if the tobacco is becoming allergic to my health. I am feeling not well for *last> one week but now I am *okey>.
The main point of jotting these few lines to you is just to inform you that the courses which you were telling me about I have not known any of them. But I won't make it <slang/>co'z we work for twelve hours day and night.  Lets><+_Let's> wait for January <slang/>co'z we will be working for eight hours normally if God wishes. The course for computer is there but  its><+_it's> one thousand shillings per month. Unless I start on January *where by> I will be reading for hours
I *recieved> a letter from our sister <name/>. She is now at Eregi T. College. She reported on 26th September and they have settled. God is so wonderful because we could not expect such miracles as she has struggled years and years.
<name/> came with my letter from home but what you had started about <name/> I don't know how true is because at the same time I have told she is having a <ea/>shamba at Gaiti. My  brother><+_brother's> life is not a straight line as we expect. One must toil and moil to get anything worthy in this world. Even us  its><+_it's> not so simple We have to work day and night to achieve the little we can afford. Imagine Shl900 and we have to give landlords and eat at the same time, you can't get a house of less than 500 in Nakuru unless the worst place where thieves are on the guard to see you vanish and then they break your house the next minute. 
The ministry of labour has told <name/> if he does not reduce hours they will take the factory. Now be aware now as the hours are reduced the less the salary will be. We aren't fortunate at Nakuru. Even Gichagi will be better I think. Life is so costly for oneself to survive. If you want to write to <name/> use the Name <name/> <address/>. pass my greetings to your comrades there. *Recieve> from <name/> who is planning to *OM> home any time from January forever-

Dear <name/>,
Hi and how have you been since the last time I saw you? I hope you're o.k. I'm fine, lounging, chilling for X-mas and the year to be over <slang/>coz I have a job I'm timing. Pray for me I get it.
How could you be so mean? Imagine I've come to see you twice and bounced both times. At least I can excuse you the second time <slang/>coz I hadn't told you I was coming. Hope you got my note. But what happened on that Tuesday I'd' told you I'd turn up? I came to your room but all in vain.
I came for cultural week but I didn't find it exactly interesting as such. I met <name/>'s friend, I think he's called <name/>, & I told him to say hi. I hope he did. 
By the way will we be with you guys next semester or  thats><+_that's> when you're going for teaching practice? Did <name/> come to tell you I bounced that day? He told me he would tell you about it after I blasted him <slang/>coz he's the one who delayed me.
In case I start working I'll call you and let you know more about it. When are you going back to college? If you want to know anything or have a message for me you can call my <slang/>sis. Her phone no. is <number/> (Peris) in case you've misplaced it.
Well,  its><+_it's> bye for now. Have a very merry x-mas and a happy new year.

How is home? I hope you are not cursing me for the silence. I surely tried to ring you that very weekend of 11th but I was not getting through. All the same I hope you are fine. <ea/>Ama? So we are on long holiday! Pledgers have made it to continue pledging even at home. Thank God K.U taught me how to handle them. 
Gosh! <name/>. Doing the do is no fun. That pain my dear. I'll give myself 2 more years before he tries again. Is that what people call fun. There is no fun my dear. <name/> was like crazy I can't believe it "all *this> years". Congratulations! Gosh! <name/> I've already started missing you. Too bad the distance <slang/>btw us puts the question north way. Home is somewhat boring. You see even my writing represents that of a boring girl. I think I'll just stay home and be mummy's good girl. How is <name/>? I think I just admire that lady. <name/>. She has set an example for you guys, <OE/>thow shall not let her down. Well for those who remember me, say <slang/>hii and tell them to work hard. Life is not easy as such as it were! <ea/>ama?

Dear <name/>,
<ea/>Namaste. How is life treating you over there? I'm doing well and my safari this way was fine. 
Before I go further let me register my sincere and heartfelt thanks for the *receiption> you gave me when I paid you a visit. How are <name/> and the other  friend><+_friends> of his do say hey to them all without *forgeting> <name/>.
As I'm *writting> we have just received an information from home that Mother <name/> <O/> Mum to <name/> and <name/> passed away yesterday and the burial ceremony will take place on 25th Oct 93. Take this as normal and let us pray to our Lord to strengthen the hearts of the family members during this sad *moments> of grief. I have been given the responsibility of informing the likes of <name/> of M.t.c Moranga, <name/>, <name/>, <name/> etc. I do not exactly know my position whether I'll travel home for the burial ceremony <slang/>cos' there are *alot> of things  have got to do which are still hanging and if I go it means I'll come back next year. That's to say the possibility of me travelling down is very *minimmal>.
Much I'll write next time. Do reply, and go through Psalm 91 and Joshua 24.15. Be blessed and be with the glory of God 
<ea/>Namaste!

Dear <name/>,
I register my apology for having to refer you as <name/>. Remember you told me  its><+_it's> only the special ones who are supposed to call you <name/>. I wonder who that blessed "special one" is. Send her my added blessings too. 
It just makes me feel glad to be alive.  Its><+_It's> such an interesting world. I pity people who are not yet born for missing it. I'm very serious you are fine and besides I have millions of words to write such that I may end up *writing> nothing.
You know friendship is a happy thing. It makes us laugh, it makes us sing and sad too. It makes us cry. It makes us seek the reason why it makes us take. It makes us give but above all else it makes us LIVE. 
I have already cried and cried internally. You know, one thing keeps me angered that I be separated from people like you. The sting of that separation bites deep; must I say deeper than the pit of hell? 
For sure your good, lovely company made me forget that there was no death and for that matter Hell as well. 
You can believe me that during your stay here every little while a horrible sickening feeling would come over me and I'd be so afraid it was all a dream. Then I'd pinch myself very often to see if it was real until suddenly I remembered that even supposing it was a dream, I'd better go on P.T.O. 
dreaming as long as I could so I stopped pinching. But I can *asure> it was real. I saw <name/>, the real image of God. 
Yesterday I dreamt that I had a Zygote in me but by the time I woke up I had already aborted. <slang/>Thanx to reality because I could not imagine confessing in public (pregnancy) that actually something happened before that. Zygote got its way inside my belly.
Surely  its><+_it's> fun being pregnant but its more *embarassing> to abort before conceiving. Stop thinking what I am thinking you are thinking of me. 
I already imagine you are bored of my stuff. 
See you when you visit . I remain

Hi <name/>!
I am at a loss on how to start this letter <slang/>b'coz I know I have wronged you so much and I don't deserve any forgiveness. Anyway how is life treating you dear girl? I hope it is as smooth as you wish. For me life is just <ea/>sasawa.
I *am> must admit I have been so lazy. I came to Thika from Shags where I was celebrating <ea/>akina Xmas & New Year around 17th Jan and that's when I found so many letters and cards awaiting and yet I have never replied to even one of them. However thanks leaps for your sweet card. However I am still trying to track down <name/> though  its><+_it's> a bit hard <slang/>coz I got a <ea/>kajob that has made me tied down. However I thank God am now able to write to you.
So tell me what happened on 22nd? Imagine I went to K.U. but to my surprise I was the only 1. I *zoobed> till I could *zoob> no more and had to give up. Why didn't you <slang/>pple turn up? I was so disappointed.
So how did the Goethe saga go. Did you start and how good is it? Please tell me in your reply. As for me I have not so far done anything constructive bookwise. I just come from job and laze about like an idler. I have not even done my *german> articles. However I have now sworn from today I'll invade them like a problem, but the other problem is that there is almost no German in my <foreign_>kleinem Kopf<foreign/>.
By the way before I forget, do me a favour send me the snaps please. I promise I'll pay the cost when we get back to <ea/>chuo. Try your best dear!
Have you communicated with anyone else? Pass my regards when you do.
As for now, <foreign_><slang/>Tis

Dear <name/>,
I hope you are fine. Everything here is fine but I am not working as yet - hopefully I will be in the near future.
I made an application for a vacancy as a 'Customer Service Assistant' advertised in 'The Daily Nation' issue of January 5 1994. I was called for an interview on the 31st of January. It involved translating an English sentence into German among other things. Apparently the interview was being conducted by Kenya Aerotech situated at JKIA on behalf of British Airways.
I am still waiting for the second interview. It was at first meant to be on March 11th but one of the British Airways Managers lost his father so it was put off until the 17th of March. On the 17th there was another hitch as a letter was faxed from London on the 16th asking the British Airways Managers at J.K.I.A not to conduct the interview as they were overstaffed and the economic situation was bad.
The people conducting the interview - Kenya Aerotech - asked us to wait for about 1 - 2 months when some of the British Airways employees are expected to retire. That will be in April or May. Hopefully I will get a chance to work if only for a few months. Rumour has it K.U. might remain closed until September after those students who are in Campus right now complete their semester - but this is just a rumour but from a very good source.
I made an application for us to share a room in Ngong Hostel - that is if you haven't changed your mind. I addressed it to the University Chief Hostels Officer and included our former room numbers and registration numbers. I hope I did the right thing.
I hope your plan to attend French classes worked out.
I received two parcels in December from the German Embassy - A magazine and a Calendarium Diary I hope you got yours.
I saw <name/> in Thika town but she was in a moving car so we just waved to each other <name/> seems to have gone undercover I never meet her nowadays.
Have a nice Day!

Dear <name/>,
Once again, I take this chance to say a word of <ea/>Sambo to you. How are you since last *friday>. I hope you are very fine and enjoying your short among many holidays you've had or you might have.
Imagine how lucky I was! I was to do my last paper in the afternoon the day we were chased from campus but fortunately the paper was brought forward to morning hours. When the notice was coming out, I was still in the exam room. I'm sure you had 'charged' enough and you <O/> just set for 21st *sept>. However, I hope you've not decided to relax. Just work at your own pace. When do you think we shall finish our courses?? I think 1996/97.
<name/>, I left Nairobi on Sunday 20TH. I tried to call you but in vain. Nobody was picking up the phone, so I just guessed that you had gone to church. And if so, I hope you did remember me in your prayers the way I always do. It was around 1.00 pm.
My journey was nice but long and tiresome. Imagine from 1.00 pm to around 8.30 pm I was just  sitted><+_sitting> in vehicles. I arrived home at 9.30 night having being rained on like nobody's business. Right now I am considering going to see the chief. What did I do? Couldn't they think of a better punishment. All the same I shall not see him this week.
On *friday>, I was planning to complain bitterly when we met, but I changed my mind because it was at the wrong time and wrong place. You had promised to pay me a visit on Thursday. So after the paper I was just waiting for you. And guess what?! I really WAITED, till I was late for dinner. The rate at which the coaches to Dreams were passing, I just guessed the obvious. I hope you didn't do it intentionally. *May be> you should arrange we go DREAMING together before you end your academic year. All depends on you. I am just requesting, and as usual I keep my fingers crossed hoping for the best from you. I think it's a good idea. What do you think??
So let me spare some for next time. As usual I shall be looking forward to reading from you soon please. I am already missing you so if you don't write back, you'll worsening my situation. Don't send the snap through post-office. I will collect it from your place when we go back.
Always yours Have a nice day, won't you!!!

My dear Cyrus!
First, I would like to express my gratitude for your previous letter. I am well and settled in this *semister> though engineering is proving very tough. We had some very tough  assignment><+_assignments> last week but I am trusting God to see me through. How are you there at K.U.? I hope you are working hard enough.
Last week, I went to Nanyulei, just before I came to sit for my C.A.T. Everyone was doing well including Purity who came form Eldoret the other day. Mom and Dad, are however complaining of drought. Imagine one of our cows dies in sunny weather. I am only hoping that rain will come soon, other life is hard back at home. Otherwise Wambui started a course in secretarial. You see jobs are hard to find in Nanyulei. She has been hunting for a job but in vain since she left school. Let us all remember her in our prayers.
I am now preparing for Inter-varsity Hockey tournament. We shall be hosting several matches next weekend. *Infact>, I am so tired by the end of the day yet the academic pressure is increasing *everyday>, but I am trying to co-ordinate my academic life plus extra-curricular as you know it would boring to be in books all the time. Besides I love hockey - and  hopes><+_hope> to be a star one day.
You asked me about Njoroge in Nakuru! He is still at Police-lines, and as you know they are very busy *nowdays>. The rate of crime has gone up, so they have to be on their toes. Otherwise,  Ive><+_I've> not had time to visit him. I caught a cold the time I had planned to visit him. But I'll try as soon as I get a chance.
From this December, we shall be going for our field attachment. I  dont><+_don't> know as yet where I shall go for my attachment! But in Agricultural Engineering, you've to take a course in design before going out to the field. We are now doing a group project, on farm structure <OM/> will helpful to farmers out there in the field. Please do inform Jane that I would not be available for her Birthday party. But I hope to send a card. Let me assure you that Engineering is a worthwhile course but very challenging. I hope we shall get jobs thereafter.
Please pass my regards to your *roomate> Manete and Mercy. Hope to hear from you soon. So long!
God Bless

Dear cousin Cyrus,
Hey, how are you? I *ope> you are still fine and comfortable under the atmospheric pressure of K.U. How is the weather over there? Let me *ope>  is not all that cold like here. Imagine, here we are almost freezing because of cold. I don't know whether we will be using our blankets in class or what, as you know the  high><+_higher> you go the cooler it  become><+_becomes>. Anyway how is life over there? Is it enjoyable or is it boring? Let me *ope> that is more than enjoyable.
Otherwise, also let me *ope> that you had a nice journey from <name/> to Nanyuki. How did you find those places of yours? Let me *ope> that you found them as they were before. On my side I had a very nice journey, from home up to here. I left everybody very fine except those who decided to leave us. May God rest her soul in eternal life.
Anyway, life here in school is more *comfotable>. Studies are very nice even if are becoming difficult. I don't know whether we will *successed> but let me *ope> that with God everything is possible. *May be> one day I will find myself *there> you are. So pray for me that God will help me not to be taken away by *wanders> of this world. Even me I promise to be keeping you in my *prays> that may God help you to have nice years and times in your studies. So work hard and everything will be easy with God.
Lastly I can tell you again that let God be your *guider> in everything you do each and every minute, and at last you will enjoy the fruits of your *hardworking>. Don't *sear> or panic but have courage and confidence in everything you do. I heard that you are saved and so don't backslide. Be firm on your faith and  God><+_God's> blessings will be flowing on you like water.
Otherwise, if you know the addresses of Inoro Secondary School there in Nanyuki where Ciru of Wangari is please let me know. I forgot to ask her when you were at home. That day, I couldn't ask because I was feeling depressed and disturbed. I would like to say *hey> to her: *Okey>.
You are highly welcome in T.T. Cool atmosphere at any time if you can manage to visit me. The most days  you can see me are on 1st Sunday of every month. So feel free to come and see for yourself where I am and also you taste the cool air near the hill.
Let me pen off and say one day we will meet for <OM/> enjoyment ceremony. Also we will talk more because Webuye Industry went on strike so  lets><+_let's> hope to meet. Say *hey> to your pals, classmates and if you can manage say *hey> to mother she (<name/>ciru).
May God bless you and have a nice year, month, day and time. Byee Byee. 
See you See you

<name/> dear,
<slang/>Howz you? Hope and pray that all is fine. Well, as for me, life has proven to be rather tough but so far all is fine. Thanks to Chuku.
Manh! You've been so silent. What happened to your postal activities across yonder. I think Kamotho a man from Muranga, who is our honourable minister of transport and communication is one of your brothers. You should all join hands and ask him to prove his patriotism to his blood. Everybody has been complaining that you no longer reply letters. I promise if you don't reply .... let me not finish.
I ever met Grace. There's hardly any week that passes by without seeing her. At least she is one among whom, I still have faith they  wont><+_won't> fade away soon . *May be> later. Things have happened, like first, <name/> and <name/> flew to Germany for that organisation "Opea", excuse my ignorance in spelling, I was not <foreign/>frau's follower. <name/>  ring><+_rang>, she said she is having fun and she has already gone to Paris for Basketball. And that she is taking advanced linguistics and computer sciences. Rumour has it that <name/> is also going for the organisation. But the funnny thing is that, the say rumour has it that is 'capital D'. I  dont><+_don't> know how true that is but, as the saying goes there is always some truth in every rumour. <name/> came to town last month that is April, but she never called me.
I met a friend who claims to have or rather had a brother in Njiris last year by the name of <name/>, and he had a B. I  dont><+_don't> know whether it is the same <name/>, who was and who I still hope is yours. They stay in Buruburu. Please try and confirm.
