And now on the comments This week the Daily News of Thursday July twenty-first had a comment on supporting the women projects and the editor says there are allegations that women contribute proportionately more of their income to family welfare than do men who hold back more for personal and individual consumption Studies made in several countries especially the developing ones have found that wives account for more than forty per cent of the total household income although their wage rates are far lower than those of their husbands The studies made in developing countries such as Mexico have proved the allegations to be true in the sense that they have found that while husbands contributed at most seventy-five per cent of their earnings to the family budget the women contributed a hundred per cent of theirs This means that in many countries it is the mother's income or food production that determines the relative nutrition of children in families The editor goes on to write Tanzania is not an exception in regard to the above situation and it is an open secret that some Tanzanian men spend most of their incomes on booze and other irrelevant issues leaving the heavy burden of raising their families squarely on the shoulders of their wives This unfortunate situation has extreme <O/> effects one of them being family disintegration which results in parents abandoning their children for nature to take care of them With the current national and the international depression biting hard the problem of abandoning children otherwise known as street children is so prevalent in Tanzania that it is really threatening the future of this country
