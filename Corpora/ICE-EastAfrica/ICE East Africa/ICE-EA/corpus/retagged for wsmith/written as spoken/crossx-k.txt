P.W. 1 ON OATH:
I am called <name/>. I work with Price Water House as a director in the auditing company. I am one of the owners of the company. Our office is at Loton Building Koinenga street. We deal with Danida as Financial Consultants who are financial  aiders> to the Government. Their office is at H.F.C.K. Building. They have a project in Kitui called the Kitui Integrated Development Programme. They (Danida) send money to the Kenya office who pass the finance to the Kitui office and in co-ordination of the Kenya Government development is done, with the money the project involves Water Sector conservation agriculture and  afforestation>. They work in collaboration with live stock development, Agriculture, Arid and <foreign/>Semi-arid lands and Water Development. As a financial consultants we do not deal with exactly how they plan their activities but I know they have field officers I work in collaboration of Government officers. In May 1992 the field officer (Kitui) became aware of financial irregularities and sought for police to investigate the irregularities ie on the field officers his appropriating the filed money. There were two stages of investigations. They were saying about One million shillings could have been misappropriated or even more. Our task was to confirm whether one million they suspected was misappropriated or much more. I concluded the investigations and end of July and June I discovered one million and over had been misappropriated. This is audit report. Report MFI one. I confirmed that 1.043 million had been misappropriated from July 1991.
All the above totals are 558,527/= they all relate to the activities carried out in respect of the Ministry of Agriculture. Next is a list of items carried out in respect of the Ministry of Livestock Development. Three specific items were a voucher of October 1991 relating to purchases of medicines and medical  valities> from Dawa pharmaceutical 20,567/= the voucher describes what was purchased as subject leaders. We are aware that Dawa pharmaceutical does not sell surgical needles. On that basis we concluded that this was a fraudulent transaction. It was an invoice used to support a train by the land. The 2nd voucher is of 046 of October 1991 of 50,000/=. This is the voucher which is meant to account to the Government the money taken by the account number. It was for purchase of vaccines from Kyoso Division. In order to show he has spent all money he was to submit documentation ie vouchers to support expenditure. In this case we found the expenditure was supported by a Government official receipt number 778788 dated 22.8.91. The arguments was that a government receipt is not a valid receipt to support the expenditure. No one would expect the invoice to be from the supplier. So on that basis we did not accept the receipt as legal supporting document for the expenditure and no explanation given we concluded the money was fraudulently spent. Voucher 046 - MFI 2 receipt number 778788 MFI 3. I see this photocopy of a receipt shows the amount to be 10/= only. It is dated 26.9.91 photocopy MFI 4 certified as a true copy of the original.
Investigation concluded at the end of July and we submitted our report to Davida at the same time with advice that action be taken through lawyers and if necessary involve the police. MFI 1 referred to the name on the voucher is <name/> Designation Veterinary officer. The money was for purchase of vaccines for Kyose Division and refers the official receipt to be No. 778788 which is the same number as MFI 3.
I copied the report involving 5 ministries named earlier. I have signed it and I wish to produce the same as exhibit in court. Exhibit 1. The information in the report was out of interviews of project management observed documentation in the management office in that David office and in cases needed explanation. We spoke to project officer concerned. I examined all documents relating to the report. They are with the UUUintul management.
P.W. 1 cross-examined by counsel:
I have officers who work with me. I delegate the interviews of the accused to my officer and so did the interview to the Dawa Pharmaceuticals. I copied the report out that we did as a team. I have never seen the accused but my officers have. They were 3 members of the team but I cannot remember which of one of them did. I personally did not deal with the documents. I have seen them before. They were presented to me for review. Yes I copied MFI 4 and MFI 3. The prosecutor asked me the number and I read and so did he as in the date. I did the information on the two documents is not the same. Yes my officers visited Kyoso. I never dealt with Davida for 4 years. I was dealing with this project for the first time. The report was made to me by Davida officer at Nairobi. I interviewed the project co-ordinator supervisor and the administration supervisor. We do not investigate people we investigate documents. We were looking at the activities in Davida  inful>. It is in the objectives of the investigations as earlier stated (reads out). We worked at the whole project. Yes we doubted the expenditure of Kshs. 50,000/= because a government receipts would not have been issued to account for an expenditure. The money was never spent therefore. Whatever is indicated in the receipt could not have been brought. I was never given an explanation of reimbursement. If that happened there would be documentation from the supplier and then debits of sending sales if does. This would have been done by the project management and then doctor<name/>. We asked for the same. They never had these documents. I have not dealt with this documents. It does not relate to MFI 3 or 4. This account is signed for by the programme officer. I was not to find out whether they had an internal auditor. I interviewed the people who signed the and learnt they acted on the receipts produced - MFI 3. Yes we are aware Dawa Pharmaceuticals does not sell syringes and needles. I was using all the knowledge I had which I did. As of the time of investigations in June 1992 I sent an officer to go and interview officers at Dawa Pharmaceuticals. I can supply the name of the officer I sent to Dawa Pharmaceuticals. Yes I know some items are brought at Dawa Pharmaceuticals. They are ie vaccines they were regular customers of Dawa Pharmaceuticals. Yes <name/> was interviewed. He is a chief accountant. Also <name/> a cashier. Validity of MFI 3 was brought by my officers but I do not know who wrote this receipt. So many officers were interviewed This is not what I wrote in this report. I did not rely on the Davida office to make my report. We found these documents in their office

P.W. 2 on oath cross-examined by counsel:
I was not issued with a receipt book with the above serial numbers. It is not that I found this receipt missing from the receipt book. Yes the district accountant have many books.

1st P.W. <name/> P/M A/S
I am employed by Kenya Green Growers Union as a subordinate staff and attached to Mombassa. My duty is office messenger work. I am charged with duties of cleaning offices manually.
My manager <name/> in February, 1991 asked me to supervise the loading fertilizers in  transporters> lorries which fertilizer was to be transported to Nairobi. We had Amana Transporters, and Bayusuf Transporters. The loading was at confined warehouse at Sangamwe. I was assigned the duty of supervising loading and writing out deliveries. My deliveries had originals and duplicates. Originals were white and duplicates yellow in colour. In the deliveries I record the truck number, drivers name, drivers identity card, quantities of the fertilizer and the driver was required to sign the delivery. I used to ask the driver how many tons his lorry is authorised, to carry. He would tell me then I would work out what quantity he was supposed to carry. It was D.A.P. fertilizer.
The fertilizer was packed in bags each of 50 kg. I would write the delivery and the driver would take both deliveries. The driver would then carry the fertilizer from confined warehouse, then he would transport it to Nairobi. The driver brings the fertilizer to Nairobi and gives the receiving clerk both delivery notes. The delivery clerk check the fertilizer to agree the number of the bags in the lorry with the number of bags shown on the delivery. If there is shortage or damages, the receiving clerk indicates the shortage or damages on both delivery notes. Then the duplicate is send back to our shipping office of KGGCU in Mitchel Cotts building (Wit. shown delivery notes). Yes, I wrote out these delivery notes. This delivery note is No. 228878 dated 1.3.91 for 660 bags by 50 kg of D.A.P. Amana  transporter> vehicle No. KVH 339 ZA5577. In this delivery note original shows that 31 bags were damaged but the duplicate shows 21 were damaged (original marked Mfl 1(a) and duplicate marked Mfl 1(b). The  transporter> writes his own delivery while I am writing out my deliveries. I am with the  transporters'>' clerk who writes out his own delivery. In this one the clerk to Amana wrote out his own delivery notes which is this one (marked Mfl 1(c) ) which delivery shows the same details as my delivery shows the same details as my delivery note. Mfl 1(c) shows 31 bags were damaged. Amana  Transporter> had sole contracted Star  Transporter> who also had his own delivery note. This Mfl 1(d) shows 21 bags had been damaged. This is the 2nd delivery note which is No. 228879 dated 1.3.91, vehicle KYL 984 ZA 9725, 840 bags DAP by 50 kg damaged as per original 44 bags (marked Mfl 2(a) the duplicate shows 14 damaged (marked Mfl 2(b).
Amana  Transporter> delivery (marked Mfl 2(c) shows 44 damaged. The subcontractor star transport delivery note (marked Mfl 2(d) show 44 bags damaged.
I am the one who wrote out all the above delivery notes. In each of them the m.v. Reg. Number, the driver's name, his ID/Card and the name of  transporters> name are recorded and each driver has signed each delivery note. At Nairobi and the receiving clerk signs the delivery note at the space (signature of the recipient and the official rubber stamp) space. In each of the delivery note it is signed by the receiving clerk and the rubber stamp KGGCU Nairobi Kenya Ltd. I don't know what happens to the damaged fertilizer. I don't know the clerk who was receiving the fertilizer at Nairobi. The receiving clerk at Nairobi records the amount of fertilizer damaged or missing.
Xxd by <name/>: I am attached to Mombassa KGGCU as a messenger. I agree we have other officers in our Mombassa office. We have clerks. We have managers in Mombassa office. At material time we had shortage of staff as we had a lot of work and this is why I was assigned this job. There were many lorries. I was writing out delivery notes supervising that the goods were loaded in the lorry. We had warehouse clerks and gate keeper also who were checking that the correct load was put into the lorry. I have over three years service. That was the only time I was asked to do this job. I agree every year we receive fertilizers. I agree I was not given the job of follow-up as there were other staff who do that job. The  transporters> had their own duplicate delivery. The warehouse clerks had tally sheet. The tally sheet are not in court.
<name/>: There are very many documents which have been marked as Ex. and I need time to peruse them and get instructions. I ask for adjournment.
Pros: No objection. We need four days. We have very long witness from Mombassa and other towns and we have a lot of documents to deal with.
Court: We have not finished even one witness. This is a very long case with witness from Mombassa and other town and a lot of documents are involved. We need at least four days p/s.

There is inter-office communications document called KGGCU 14. The damages and loss or shortage must be recorded on the delivery. He could also record the same on KGGCU 14. I have heard about KGGCU 58. I do clerical job at times but in a small way. I don't know KGGCU 58 form. The receiving clerk must raise claim form for the damaged and shortages but I am not sure. I know the  transporters> pay for damages and shortages so the cost of damaged and lost bags is deducted from their transport payments. The  transporter> is given a copy of delivery so that he can claim transport costs (Wit. shown Mfl 32(a),(b) and (c)).
On Mfl 32(a) four bags are shown as damaged
On Mfl 32(b) four bags are shown as damaged
On Mfl 32(c) four bags are shown as damaged.
There are no alterations on any of Mfl 32(a), 32(b) and 32(c).
(witness shown Mfl 15(a), 10(a))
I can see this Mfl 10(c) and I can see a signature there and even on 10(b) I can see a signature. The signature belongs to the  transporter> M/s Amana. I can see Mfl 15(b) and 15(c) and 19(b) and 19(c) are also signed by the  transporters> after receiving them from the drivers. I don't know why  transporters> sign these form.
Re-xd by pros: I don't know at what stage the  transporter> signs these documents.

If there is shortages I deduct the value of the damages or shortage from the payment to the  transporter>. I receive yellow copy attached to the invoice from  transporter>. We prepare a schedules showing the remarks which have been made on the yellow copies. After payments we retain the delivery yellow copy and the invoices. I know KGGCU 14 which is a memo.
This has nothing to do with delivery notes. This KGGCU 14 is written by the receiving depot and it shows damages or shortages. The receiving branch sends us the KGGCU 14 direct and the yellow copy of the delivery note is given by the receiving branch to the  transporter> who brings it to us with his transport invoice so we check if the yellow copy of delivery note agrees with the KGGCU 14 details then we pay. If the delivery note disagree with KGGCU 14 we make enquiries from the receiving depot and we can't pay till the clarification is done. KGGCU 58 is a form used by receiving depot to confirm the total of fertilizers delivered to them and the damages and shortages it is send to us direct by the receiving branch.
KGGCU 15 is our delivery notes which I have referred to above. I agree fertilizers was delivered to Nairobi from our Mombassa offices. I received all the invoices concerning this case. I can see these documents. Among them I received our delivery notes KGGCU 15 and  transporters> invoices. I have checked through Mfl to Mfl 13 which are here and I confirm that I am the one who received all the delivery notes and invoices from the  transporter>. I did not sign or indicate anywhere that I am the one who received them but I signed the  transporters> copy of his invoice to indicate that I had received his invoice and the yellow copy of our delivery notes. KGGCU 14 is an internal memo which is sent by the receiving depot so as to show how many bags they have received and how many were damaged. I don't reflect the cheques issued on the delivery notes, or invoice from  transporters>; but we prepare a schedule of what we have paid to the  transporter> and the shortage and damages. <name/> is the one who prepares the schedule showing payments. I don't know the  transporter>.
Xxd by <name/>: I am a general clerk. P.w. 1 works as a subordinate staff. He cleans the  godown> and works as a messenger. I am aware last year in February, p.w. 1 was given the duty of loading lorries bringing fertilizer to Nairobi I agree this was not his normal duty but I agree this wasn't his normal duty but the manager assigned that duty. We are eight clerks in the office. I can't tell why the manager assigned p.w. 1 a subordinate staff this work. We claim damages from the insurance company. We deduct damages from the  transporters>. I agree from Mfl 1 to 13 there are no shortages but only damages. I agree I am the one who received the yellow copies of the delivery notes. Before making payment I inform the manager about damages so that he can claim the damages. I agree the receiving office must raise the claim. The manager must sign the claim forms. I am not aware if the claim for damages was raised. We don't charge the  transporter> for damages but shortages. Nairobi depot retain original of the delivery notes and they send the duplicate copy. The receiving clerk raises KGGCU 14 showing the damaged bags and the shortages. The KGGCU 58 also confirm losses and damages. I am not aware of rechecking the fertilizer. We receive copies of invoices from  transporters>. We have not brought KGGCU 14 in court NO KGGCU 58. I don't know why these documents have not been brought to court. Immediately we receive the invoice from  transporters> we record it in a book. I agree this book is not in court. I agree the invoices from  transporters> have not been brought to court.

P.W. 3 <name/> Xtian Sworn States in English.
I work with Ministry of Information and Broadcasting as a laboratory Technician. I am based in Kericho. In March 1992 I was based at Mombasa House Nairobi. On 30.3.92 at 1 p.m. I do re-call I was in Mombasa House. At 1 p.m. I opened the video room to dust the machines. That morning we had a meeting and the head of our department had asked me to dust the machines. Immediately I opened I saw the floor of the room was too duty. I decided not clean it. At same time a number of people came in saying they wanted to see the news. I switched on the monitors and we sat down to listen to news. I know <name/>. He's here (id 2nd accused). He was one of those who came to watch news. He's an editor in same department. I know <name/>. He's here (id 1st accused). He's also an editor. I saw him on that day in the video room. He had also come to watch the news among others. We watched news and also a programme called neighbours.
At 3 p.m. there were four people left in the room. They were <name/> <name/> and the two accused.
I told them to bang the door when they are ... because I was returning the key to <name/>.
The locks were type one can lock without keys.
A JVC professional radio cassette is a video recorder. We had one on 4th floor in the video room, Mombasa house.
Its the same room we were using that lunch hour. On day in question I saw the video recorder on a table where its usually kept.
There were two video recorders that time.
Both were there that day. I left the two in the room when I left at around 3 p.m. I went back to the room the next day 31.3.92. It was 9 a.m. I went to 4th floor and met <name/> my supervisor <name/> and <name/> both of engine ring and a number of technicians. I was told that one of the video cassette recorders had disappeared. I told them I left the machine and four people in the room. I opened the room to confirm and found that only one video recorder was present.
We looked around for the machine in 4th & 5th floor. We could not find it. In the evening of that day two police officer came and told us to go and record a statement which I did. I never saw the machine again.
Prosecutor
The machine was not produced. I will require to re-call the witness to identify the machine.
Cross examined by Counsel for accused.
I recorded my statement on 4th. Yes I was arrested. I was arrested on 31.3.92. Between 31st and 4th I was in the cells.
I was at Central Police Station. I was released on 4th. I was taken once daily to room 10 at the police station for interrogation. I would not say the interrogations were polite. There were no threats or violence. My duties at Mombasa House was film processing, negative cutting etc.
I was not in charge of the room. <name/> was. The room was opened by me on 30th. Yes the responsibility of the room was under me. We are many people who can enter the room. We are 14 in all. I was going to Kenya polytechnic to see my project supervisor since I was a student there that is why I left at 3 p.m. Editors and Technicians could collect the keys to the room and would return them without locking the room leaving it for the last person to lock it.
The Editors edited while labs did the laboratory work and technicians did dubbing. I have been working in that place since 1989.
Nothing had disappeared until 30.3.92.
The only key I know to the room is the one kept by <name/>. The room was locked to secure it. We acted out of trust among all who worked in that room. I trusted the four men I left by the room because we had been working together on that basis.
There is a security officer on fourth floor. He was supposed to check those leaving the floor. There is another security on ground floor checking all properties leaving the building. One has to have a gate pass from head of section for whatever item they carry out. I could not imagine with all the checking that a video machine could have left the building without a pass. I cannot say who did it. We leave work at 5 p.m. Not all of us leave at 5 p.m. There is no order of two people should enter or leave work. We looked for the video in the various rooms on 4th and 5th floor.
Re-examined.
<name/> keeps the keys to the video room. Any laboratory technician and any editor could be given the key to the room to enter for use. One was given the keys to the room when they had work to do there. I had left other people behind to lock the room in various occasions in the past.
I had also been left behind to lock up on various occasions in the past. Witness released.

Before I had drunk that beer that man called <name/> came out from inside the bar. We were sitting at the  verandah> of the bar. I could see him as there was electricity.
I knew <name/> who is that man (accused) even before. He used to be my neighbour where we lived at Githurai. Accused also used to sell us cassettes. Accused came out of the bar and went to the toilet. As accused came from the toilet he passed where we were. Accused was wearing black open shoes.

Accused then picked shs. 100/= from the money he had put on the table leaving shs. 60/= on the table.
Accused said he had given <name/> two cassettes worth shs. 140/= so since accused owed <name/> shs. 200/= <name/> should take the shs. 60/= which added to the value of the two cassettes (shs. 140) would add up to 200/=.
As they were quarrelling one policeman came and stopped the quarrel. Accused then removed his other shoe and left it with <name/> telling him to select or choose whether he wanted his life or his shs. 200/=.
Accused then ran to his home. He stayed for three minutes then came back with his hand in his trouser pocket. Accused produced something half way from the pocket and looked at it then pushed it back into his pocket.

I gained my memory the following day 10.3.90 just to find myself in Kenyatta Hospital. I stayed in Kenyatta Hospital for four days. The doctor operated my stomach to remove the bullet. The bullet had just entered my tummy but no exit wound was there.

On arrival in the bar I found accused and someone else. As I was passing then, I was about two metres behind them there was a gun shot. Then a second shot was fired.

P. W. I <name/> M/A/S STATES:
I am employed by Nairobi City Commission. My duties as a sergeant. I am attached to Investigation offices to check on Nairobi City Commission properties. On 4.4.91 I was around Muindi Mbingu and Moktar Daddah street at around 11.00 p.m. and I was on patrol when I sighted two city commission workers, one is a mechanic (first accused identified) and 2nd accused <name/> is a city <ea/>Askari the first accused was removing coins from the parking metre and putting it in his pockets. The 2nd accused was with him. I became suspicious and I hide myself and waited to see what to do and I waited and I saw Accused I move to a other metres and I saw them remove money from one metre to another and pocketed it. I trailed then to Moktar Daddah street. Accused I then removed money from the other parking metre and I saw the lady move away and I confronted her and she came and I held both of them. I detained them and I asked the lady accused 2 and asked her why she was seeing accused I take money and she was not doing anything. On the way accused I pleaded with me but I refused and took them to my boss where accused I was asked what he had and he said he had only 10/= he was using for testing the metres and the boss insisted he removed everything and we asked him to remove his uniform and we recovered Kshs. 96/= from him. They were silver coins. They are this ones (MBI I). We then took them to Central police station. When the mechanics are repairing the metres was to be accompanied by the City <ea/>Askari like accused I and accused 2. After they repair the money in that metre should be returned.
Cross-examined by the defence:
I have enough experience in the metre system set up. I also trained partly. There are 2 keys to a metre. They are both for opening the metre. I did not ascertain about the keys in possession of the accused I. The 2nd accused acts as a guard. I did not receive a complain from Accused 2. Accused I was dressed in a dust coat on top of his clothing. The dust coat is to repair the metre. If the metre is full you move to the next metre. If one finds the metre is full one only takes up the excess and put it in the next metre. It is not possible that all the metres opened by the <-accuseds><+_accused> were full and being emptied. If a mechanic finds there are foreign elements in the metres he has to repair the metre and if the it is stuck money, he repairs the metre and returns the money. I cannot recall whether the dust coat was opened or closed. I think it was opened. The dust coat had the tools. I ascertained some metres were working. They were 20 metres and he repaired all and they were functioning. I did not take a key from <name/> (accused I) when I arrested him. He removed it in my boss's office.
Cross-examined by defence counsel for accused 2:
I have been in City Commission for all over 20 years. I have known the accused for 3 years. I was not in uniform. The money from the metres are collected everyday. The mechanics are assigned where to work everyday. I did not only suspect but I observed what I have said.

I have been working with NCC as a parking metre mechanic. I was given a No. 2 0909788. I was employed on 2.4.89. I was trained at our workshop at Ladhies. We repair and maintain parking metres. When repairing metres we are to make sure every metre works if it has not we repair and make sure it is in order. Metres block to papers, foreign coins, match box sticks. We are to remove the blockage. We retain the normal coins in your dust coat and put into an empty metre box. We are given work by a workshop foreman one <name/>.

There were showers and I had opened the metres and removed the coins and closed it again and did that hurriedly as it is not advisable to expose the metres. I took all the collection coins to other metres box. I had attended more than 200 metres and I found coins and other substance which I put into my dust coat.

Nil
Cross-examined by the Prosecutor:
I have been in the City Commission for 26 years. I am IC of metre mechanics I do not do the repair work myself. I may just patrol around. Accused I is merely an employee in my department. Usually when a mechanic goes to work, the mechanic is given a City <ea/>Askari to make sure the money is not stolen by the mechanic. The paces between two metres is hardly 3 paces. You keep money in the next metre if the one preceding it is blocked. If a metre is blocked, it could only be carrying only 10.00 to 12.00. If the money was about 96.00, it could have been recovered from 9 metres. If one finds that the metres are blocked the money collected is a lot, he makes a report to the collectors.

Out of the 3 members one of the members must be a member appointed by the Minister Administrative the department insists that at least 14 days notice must be given so that the permanent secretary commerce is represented at the meeting policy matters have to be discussed during that meeting which include among others approving of trade loans.

Court Proceed.
P.W.I continues, consequently to the visit I discovered that out of the loan received a total of Kshs. 22,449/80 had not been accounted for. Also confirmed that there was an  wint> agreement between the accused and 3 loan defaulters who owed the board a total of 22,299/. A total of Kshs. 47,000 had been issued out to 4 people without the boards authority it was also discovered that the accused had issued Kshs. 25,000/= as trade loans to two unqualified people. On return to Nairobi a letter was written to the permanent Secretary giving the details of who had been discovered and the permanent secretary was requested to take any disciplinary action seemed fit. It was signed by Mr. <name/> the deputy director of internal trade it was not issued to the permanent secretary it was put away and the matter restored there. Later on it was discovered that on the statutory period of notice of meeting had not been given but 2 days notice had been given instead and the board convened administratively after every board meeting the secretary is required to prepare minutes of that particular meeting and circulate such minutes and a copy must be forwarded to the Accounting officer who is the permanent secretary commerce as soon as possible. Accused as soon as possible is interpreted to be 14 days after such a board meeting. The board meeting held on 2.6.89 minutes had not been received at the headquarters as of 26/90. So on 26.3.90 I was instructed to make yet another visit to the Isiolo trade office so as to inspect for a second time Isiolo district joint loan board. Among my inspection I was to verify details of the meeting held on 2.6.89. On arrival I was given some of the documents included 2 lists of approved loan applicants. The 1st list had 12 names who were to receive a total of 103,000/=. Among them there were 4 names that had been issued with loans. Prior to the meeting they were <name/> No.3. for Kshs. 10,000/= trading at Nyati Market. The second <name/> alleging trading in Township to receive Kshs. 12,000/=. <name/> of model Gashe market to receive 5,000/=. The list one was <name/> of Township to receive 15,000/=. The list MFI I. The second list taken in 1990 the accused person was transferred from Isiolo to Nairobi headquarters and another officer was posted there to take over the functions of the secretary and treasurer of Isiolo joint loan board. Accused it was only then that the minutes of 2.6.89 were received at my office which included a list of approved applicants who were in total 40 in number to receive a total of Kshs. 410,000/= among the 40 applicants in the 2nd list included <name/>.
<name/> appearing as No. 5 and No. 39 on the list under 39 she was referred to as <name/> to receive 15,000/= under No. 5 the same applicant was to receive Kshs. 12,000/=. There were anomalies because we would not have had 2 different lists for the same board meeting I produce the list as MFI I. When I found the list the cheques had already been paid and so I went to bank and requested for the cheques they were 24 in number including cheque No. 136626 paid to <name/> drawn on 5.2.90 for Kshs. 15,000/= cleared by Barclays Bank Isiolo branch on 13.3.90. At the back of this cheque it had been endorsed to one Mr. <name/> behind it a signature and ID card No. 5548868/69. Then account 1058329 it was later discovered that the endorsed person was the District special branch officer, Isiolo District marked MFI 2.
Cross examined by Accused:
I found the section in 1982. Prior to this I was at Busia Trade office. I became a trade officer in 1979. I had worked with Home affairs, office of the president East Africa customs and before this I was a treasurer of and a holder of CPA Certificate. We were a loan scheme return and had drawn of the receipts. Accused from 2 for loans issued form 3 is a ledger account noting defaults in repayment. These are prepared by the trade office. Yes I have been a trade officer in various stations. Yes I used to prepare those reports. The board is chaired by the District commissioner, 3 members appointed by the Minister but delegated to the PS and the Secretary recommends the people to the Chairman and particulars are sent to one PS i.e. name, qualifications, profession and standing in the community. And the DS vets and  apprents> from the recommended. Yes they must have acquired some standard of education. I have never come across an illiterate member of the board. An applicant approaches the trade office gives particulars of his trade within the locality and how he intends to use the form. He is issued with a form which he gives and the trade officer is that with the form. He then visits the business. The visit can be trade by the officers under the trade officer. Livestock traders can be considered. Yes it was considered a trade at the time they were in Isiolo. There is a schedule of the particulars of the applicant and purpose of issuing the loan. There is a vetting guide. Accused if he is a livestock trader then you indicate it in the vetting guide. The vetting guide forms part of the applicants file. You do not disburse the cheques until the minute are verified. I duly know of the meeting of 2.6.89 when you were in Isiolo. The list produced is the one from the meeting of 2.6.89. The procedure is to circulate before the meeting. In an agenda for considering loans. You must have a list of recommended names of the applicants, the recommended amount, the security supplied and the purpose of the loan, and the market place. The board is supposed to discuss and decide. As the secretary you give reasons for recommending or rejecting or pending the decision. The list is there approved and as the secretary you prepare the minutes and dispatch it and await approval. The secretary is the first signatory and the district commissioner is the 2nd signatory. The members are either to the minutes so as to confirm them. Before you issue the cheques, you are supposed to have all the files of the applicant i.e. App. form vetting guide recommendation of the secretary. The secretary normally the committee issues on understanding to register the interest of the particular board. The DC is the chairman because he is the administrative authority in the area. I got the list from your office and I did not fabricate any list. I am in job group H and I don't know your job group. I am not your Junior. One of the conditions is that an approved applicant was open an account if he had none before the application. Accused the secretary has the duty to ensure that this is true before the cheque is released. All our cheques are crossed. In case you did not encourage then to open accounts then you have failed miserably because he is supposed to develop trade in that area. I was coming to Isiolo to inspect the office not you as a person. I visited there once when you were there I wrote a report on my return. The money that could not be accounted from was established from your books of account. The letter did not reach the PS and I did not know why. 1st visit was 2.11.88. 2nd visit in 1989. My report was not malicious and it is not true that I came to cut meat and I sniffed around. You should us who circulated the report. The 2.6.89 was the second board meeting. Your list has a detention of centre names (points). The unqualified people did not have business then were no securities and the names were not approved by the board. The unqualified people are <name/> and <name/>. They No. 1,3,660/ dated 22.8.89.

P.W. 9 SWORN AND XX. BY <name/>:-
Yes I am a supervisor but I used to work in a junior position as a postal officer. I used to deal with FB.21 documents. Before they are filled they are kept where the customer has access. They are in bundles or individually, a customer can come and be given a single form. When one is filled, they are brought to me and I immediately take to the supervisor as a postal officer. I pass them over to the supervisor in person but at City Square a messenger collects these forms and takes them to the supervisor who checks and stamps them. At City Square post office, we had two special stamps UUUatago. In extreme cases where he is very busy, we could have a 3rd one. The supervisor keeps them under lock and key and they cannot be released to postal officers. Some stamps were withdrawn eg. one broke down and was removed. It was broken viz the handle on the side came out. I cannot tell when it started breaking. A 2nd one was withdrawn for similar reasons and we received a new one. It was between mid 1980 in the course of 1989 but they were used before the discovery of the breakage. I cannot know how many forms had been stamped with the two defective special day stamps. All parts may not come out clearly. I pointed out those that I signed for, I disagreed with those that did not pass through me. But I admitted those that passed through me. Ref: MFI-14(a) I would not know how many such documents were passed on that day of 25.10.89. They are at post bank, at the very final stage, Ref: MFI-14(e) I cannot be able to know how many more were stamped on that day. On 11.10.89, Ref: MFI-14(f), I wouldn't know how many other forms were passed and if they are the same or not. On 24.10.89 Ref: MFI-14(b) would not know how many were dealt with on that day, unless they were brought here for comparison some of these forms merely have a date and only a few have an initial apart from the date. I do not know whose initials they are. I wouldn't know all the supervisors of 1989, but I remember a few.
I went on transfer about 12.2.89 I have used a special date stamp which does not show the details. There are obvious defects in these date stamp impressions.
xx. by <name/>:-
On S.B.21 the name of the depositor, address, office code. No cheque digit amount to be withdrawn and amount in the book signatures and identification i.e. No. on ID.CARD. All these details are checked by a counter clerk and then counter checked by the supervisor. The code is the most important item and I wouldn't tell from which office it has emanated. Another supervisor can be there. The outgoing supervisor or officer in charge of section hands over the stamp to the incoming supervisor. The officer in charge does not have custody of the stamp. He is the other person who can have access to the stamp.
Court:- <name/> enters court.
P.W.9 xx. by <name/>:- Continues.
Ref: MFI-9 it was dealt with by the officer on counter No. 16. There is no initial on the stamp and I cannot tell who approved it.
Ref: MFI- I cannot tell whose initials these are. But I knew the initials of those I worked closely with. It is a unique stamp. Irregularities would first be defected by the supervisor.
xx. by <name/> for 3rd accused:-
Yes the special date stamp is kept under lock and key. These forms have a similar impression to a special date stamp. A genuine withdrawal form would have been completed.
The supervisor then checks for all details and the stamps the form for payment. Without the date stamp and initials of approval of all details, there can be no payment. Reconciliation is done at a different and later stage. I do not do  reconciliations>. I do not know if it was done in this case.
xx.by <name/>:-
I have worked as a counter officer for about ten years. I am fully conversant with particulars needed on these forms. A customer fills and complete the form the form and the counter men checks it ... writes ID.CARD NO. connectives of entries entered and passes it to supervisor who approves and initials it for payment and then the cashier pays it. It is not part of the duty of a counter officer to complete a form. But a counter men can only assist.
Re-Examination:-
The officer in charge can handle a date stamp out only  rearely>. It is the supervisors who handle it. To be a genuine date stamp, it could have a logo, code No, and a word like "AKIBA" MM.
P.W.10 A MALE ADULT SWORN AND STATES:-
My name is <name/>. I work for K.P. & Tel. at City Square as the postal superintendent. I became a superintendent in 1985. My duties are to control staff under me and supervision like checking in the pass books, etc. I also check SB 21 forms. Two of us checks them two in the morning and two in the afternoon. In 1990 we were four in total. I check the entries in the SB.21 form for entries if they are similar in the pass-book and if it is reported stolen or not. I then stamp with the day special stamp and I initial it in red ink. To- date I cannot identify the initials of other supervisors. We had 3 viz Nos. 114, 370, and 364, the two were being view at one time and one was removed from service. It was No. 570 due to its defects. Ref: MFI-5, none of these ten S.B. forms passed through my hands and none of them are initialled. They are not date stamped but have the post office stamp. The stamps thereon are similar to the ones we used but does not show the code No. But the logo is correct, they were issued on 9.2.90 Ref: MFI-4, 20 S.B. forms, they appear all to have been initialed. They all been the special date stamp. The code No. are not clear visible. The logo is similar to the ones we used and the date is 9.2.90. Ref: MIF- 6(a) and (b) none of them passed through me and they are initialled but I cannot identify the initials and are dated 24.1.90 as the date of issue. They all bear the day stamp but no code no. Ref: MFI-7, none of these forms passed through my hand. They all bear the date stamp. None of them have the code No. and are been initialled. But I cannot identify any of the initials and date of issue is 9.1.90.
The custody of the special date stamps is normally with the supervisors who keep them under key and lock when not in use. They are the only ones who handle the special date stamps. We work in shifts and they are the same date stamps we hand over to the incoming shifts. No other staffs other than the supervisor uses these stamps. When on duty the date stamps are only available to the 2 of us.
I know 1st accused, 2nd accused, 6th and 7th were working under me as counter officers at one time or another.
xx. by <name/> for 1st and 6th  accuseds><+_accused>:-
I was working as a supervisor who is none or less like a superintendent. The two ranks are the same. No. 370 was bad we discovered when it could not give any code impressions on S.B.21 forms. I cannot tell which date but it was sometimes in January, 1990. No it was not after the complaints, we the supervisors discovered that it was not putting the code No. Its me who discovered and I noted it in my diary. The filed  daries> are kept in the store. I last saw it when I was at the counter sometime in January, 1990. I did not tell the police that. Yes, if a special stamp cannot produce a code No, code Nos, cannot appear in these S.B.21 forms. We do stamp it on a form. The moment it was discovered, it was not in use. It was only one that was removed from circulation. Ref. MFI-10 has special stamp and initials and the code No. is not visible a dot, i.e. heavy ink. We do not have a dot in our special stamps. The dot is in place of a code No. They are not visible those dots are all in all the forms. They are just marks when the special stamps were discovered to be defective, they were withdrawn immediately. They are marks, these stamps were being kept by my colleagues and myself. In October, 7th 1989 the code Nos, were 370 and 364 and hence 370 or 364 was to appear on MFI-10. I cannot tell which one was to appear there. Ref: MFI-11 either 370 or 364 was to appear on day form on the stamp at the bottoms and the same applies to MFI-14(a)(b)(c),(d)(e)(f), MFI-15(a)(b)(c)(d)(e), the code No could either be 370 or 364. But I am not clear as to which one would have been used on each of them. I did not handle any of these documents above. I did not process them. All  accuseds><+_accused> were in my shifts and these forms could not have been processed in my absence. I would have seen them using a different stamp my shifts was busy most of the time. They would only pass the documents to us to process. At the counter they only enter figures and Nos and pass them over to us for processing and stamping and they would only pay after confirming the day special date stamp. We were the only people having the stamps. If I initialled a form, they would pay one counter officer verify the  informations><+_information> and stamps then with post office stamp and put their Nos. and pass them to us for processing. Supervisors cannot conspire to defraud without a counter officer revising the passbook. Yes I can bring the diary containing the faulty day stamps on which dates the defects were discovered and withdrawn. There are records which are kept. The book shows the handing over report and when the stamp was working and withdrawn.
<name/>:- I also need the book.
<name/>:- I leave it to court.
Court:- Case  reffered> to court No. 1 on 22.6.92 for re-allocation for at least a week to cover the 13 witnesses still remaining. Bond Extended.

xx. by <name/> for 2nd and 8th Accused:-
I only supervised the 8th accused at City Square, main counter, he was working under my shifts for about 5 months. I have been a supervisor at Community HQ. G.P.O. Tom Mboya post office and at City Square post office stock payments stock lists come from Savings bank HQ. after every forty nights indicating the passbooks allegedly stolen or those circulating irregularity e.g. adding in funds irregularity. Every supervisor would have the stock payment list to check on it. The significance of the Nos. on the special date stamps is the differentiation of which post office it would have been used I would be able to tell it one is used in another post office. There were about ten to eight cashiers on the counter they were not changing unless their duties changed. I would not tell the signatures of every cashiers, but I could tell of those I was working with.
xx. by <name/> for 7th accused and also for H/B. for <name/> for 7th accused:-
I know its supposed to be kept for a period of 2 years and its called a diary book. But this particular one has disappeared it would have shown which supervisor had which stamps and on which particular days. Yes, I recorded a statement with the Police and I signed every page of it. Ref. the statement, some were destroyed either by heavy inking or destruction.

3RD P.W. X/M S/S
My name is <name/>. I am *emplyed> KGGCU as the area *Manager> in charge of Eastern Kenya which includes Nairobi and Mombasa. My work is to supervise KGGCU branches in terms of administration. I know accused. He is <name/>. He is that man (accused). He was working as a clerk in KGGCU Godown at KNTC *alongyellow> road in *Industiral> Area. He was a clerk under me.  Accused><+_Accused's> work was to manage or supervise receipts and dispatches of *Fertilizers> stored at KGGCU stores. On 27.3.91 I received a letter from our head office. This letter was transferring accused from Nairobi *ware house> to KGGCU Nairobi branch. On receiving the letter I was supposed to get *some one> to take over from accused. I requested my *ware-house> assistant <name/> to go and *takeover> from accused. <name/> went to *takeover>. On 6.5.91 I got information from Mr. <name/> that there was fishy work which had been going on at the KNTC go-downs. On 7.5.91 I went to verify what was the matter. Since I had information as to where the operation went wrong, I went straight to the place. I found some labourer changing the fertilizers from 25x5x5x55 to D.A.P. *Fertilizer> bags. I asked the  labourer><+_labourers> what they were doing. They told me that they had been instructed to do the change by accused. There was no instruction to change. It is not even allowed. Each type of fertilizer has its own packing bags. I asked accused if he is the one who had issued the instructions and he denied. I then instructed accused and Mr. <name/> to take the figures of the fertilizers which had been changed and to take the figures of empty bags which had been emptied. I then reported the case to our internal auditors in Nakuru which is our head-office. I *reportedas> I suspected there was something wrong. The internal auditor sent a Mr. <name/> to verify. He arrived on 8.5.91 and started checking. I was asked to take over the store keys from accused. Finally it was confirmed by Mr. <name/> that there were missing  bag><+_bags> of D.A.P. fertilizers. From then our security officers took over the matter. We prepared a taking officer certificate which was signed by accused and <name/> so Mr. <name/> took over from accused. The handing over certificate was prepared by accused and Mr. <name/> and I witnessed the taking over certificates. Accused, Mr. <name/> and Mr. <name/> did the actual counting and after verification they made this stock take-check book. This report is in a form of a book. This report is in a form of a book with serial numbers which number is 183141. It is dated 15.5.91 and relates KNTC go-down. The stock take-check book is kept in the office. (marked Mfl 34). According to this document (Mfl 34) 50 kg. DAP fertilizer had a shortage of 1742 bags. This a bin card record kept in the stores. It is the control card in the store. This relates to DAP missing fertilizer and it is for the period 6.3.91 to 16.5.91 (marked Mfl 35). This is the office record for the same DAP fertilizer. We call it Kardex. It is number 80312 and the second Kardex is 80281 of the same fertilizer but it is kept in the office. There are two movements of fertilizers. There movement-in and BBBandRRR movement-out that is dispatch and receipt. When the clerk in the go-down receives the fertilizer he  entered><+_enters> it in into *Freight> book and then he transfers the same quantity into the bin card. After this he  write><+_writes> out another record called KGGCU 58 transferring the same quantity or information from the freight book into the KGGCU 58. The original of *Freight> book and the original KGGCU 58 is brought to *out> offices on Kampala road and from these details we enter the details into our cardex record.
After we had up-dated our cardex we forward the original of KGGCU 58 and original of the *Freight> book to our *Head> office and we retain duplicates. The second transaction is dispatch which is movement out. Here the clerk must get authority from the *ware house> manager to dispatch anything from the warehouse. The authority goes to the clerk in form of inter branch transfer (IBT). We call it KGGCU 50. The clerk receives the IBTs signed by the manager. When the clerk receives IBTs he releases the quantity he is authorised to dispatch. He *cant> release anything unless he has authority in IBTs form. Orders are normally released to our branches not individuals. After dispatch the IBTS is taken back to our offices in Kampala road and we update our cardex cards from the information from the cardex. I am aware of 1742 bags shortage. At the material time I was the *ware house> manager in Nairobi currently I am the Eastern area manager. I took over as manager warehouse Nairobi in February 1991 and in February 1992 I was promoted to *Area Manager>. There was another loss which was discovered by the auditors after intensive investigation.
Xxd by Mrs. <name/>: I knew accused from 1986. Accused since employment had been working in that *ware house>. KNTC was one of the godowns. There are many  go-down><+_go-downs> or  warehouse><+_warehouses> and KNTC was one of the many  go-down><+_go-downs>. We had leased a go-down at KNTC premises. We had only a small office for accused and the rest were stores. Accused had one labourer who was assisting him. We had eight stores in the KNTC warehouse. We had security hired from another firm who were guarding the place. There is a gate which is manned by KNTC security. At night we had our security guarding the place. Where we have our own compound we keep records of vehicles which come in but this was KNTC compound and many vehicles would come to KNTC so KNTC could have kept the vehicle record. KNTC personnel was not under me. It was  accused><+_accused's> duty to know what was coming in or going out. The KNTC had no reason to ask what our clients were carrying out. Accused would have moved out as soon as the handing over was complete. I made *some one> available to take over from accused. I *cant> remember when Mr. <name/> went to take over from accused but it was in April, 1991. My duty was to see that a proper handing over had been done. I am not aware that Mr. <name/> reported on duty in  accused><+_accused's> place on 3.4.91. I am not aware that accused and Mr. <name/> took stock on 3.4.91. The *store-check> books are in a form of a book. Page 183138 was missing from the stock check book and I have never seen it. I look at the records as *incharge>. Accused and <name/> signed Mfl 34. I did not count the stock. Accused and Mr. <name/> agreed Mfl 34 was correct. I was there during the taking over. The *stockcheck> records are kept by the clerk when not used. If they are used they are brought to my office stock check page 183138 was missing and I have never seen it. From page 1831348 to 41 were three pages. The bin card and *cadex> are records of stock. The freight book would reflect what was delivered. Mr. <name/> took over from accused on 15.5.91. On 27.4.91 I was away on leave and there was an assistant manager. Mr. <name/> is outside court. I had not sent Mr. <name/> to take over. Mr. <name/> was to take over the whole store and Mr. <name/> was sent there to see that accused did not interefere with the checked records as Mr. <name/> was away on urgent matter. Mr. <name/> was not coming to take over from Mr.<name/>. I am not aware of an earlier taking over. I gave verbal instruction to accused and Mr. <name/>. We wrote a letter asking for handover when we discovered malpractises. Mr. <name/> came from head office to witness the handover. Accused and Mr. <name/> signed a taking over certificate also. Mr. <name/> signed the handover certificate. He never refused to sign the certificate. Mr. <name/> told me that there was unusual operation in the *depo>. I went there and I found the usual changing the bags and they told me accused had ordered them to do so. I saw them changing the bags. The clerk employs casual labourers and he pays them from money from the office. I ordered the labourers to stop *th> *changin> the fertilizer. We did not charge the  labourer><+_labourers> because they were working under the instructions of accused. May be the  labourer><+_labourers> did not know it was wrong. If there are damages the bags are kept aside for insurance people to come and verify them for payment.

My name is <name/>. I am employed by KGGCU attached to *Industrial Area> Nairobi *Area> as *Warehouse> assistant. My duty is to manage other workers.

The 1st week of April, 1991 I was instructed by p.w. 3 to go and take over our stores which were at KNTC along Yala road; as the officer there was going on transfer. I was going to take over the store from Mr. <name/> who is that man (accused). Accused had been *transfered> to our Nairobi branch.

We signed the handing over, *taking-over> certificates after checking the stores. We completed this store checkbook or checking sheet (Mfl 34). This checking sheet after checking went to our auditors. On this checking sheet I found in store 69223 bags 20x10x10 each of 50 kg fertilizers. I then signed the bin card which was showing 69223 bags of fertilizers. The cardex card which is kept under lock and maintained by a different person was showing the same figure. On the same store I found Muriate potash 50 kg fertilizers. I found 37185 bags each of 50 kg. each. The bin card and the cardex  cards><+_card> were each reading the same.

HEARING STARTS
P.W. I <name/> S/S IN ENGLISH
I work with the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting as *Deputy> secretary. I recall that in the first week of January, 1993 one Mr. <name/> of HFCK rang my office. He wanted to know whether I had HFCK *Which> I opened in 1988.
I replied in the affirmative. The account was still operational. Mr. <name/> asked if I knew any official at HFCK. I told him I knew Mr. <name/> who was dealing with my *mortage> account which was closed in 1989 when I cleared the *mortage>. Mr. <name/> indicated there was a problem. I immediately proceeded to HFCK I alerted Mr. <name/> that I lost my identity card in the last week of December, 1992 and that I reported to police and got an abstract vide receipt No AU 683412 for 10.1.93 (Receipt marked with abstract Mfl 1). I got a new identity card No. 12372133. The number on the lost identity card was 1728399/64. All the documents bear my old identity card number. The abstract shows it was for loss of identity card. Mr. <name/> told me there was a problem with someone else's account not mine. He did not tell me the particulars. Mr. <name/> said I would hear from CID *Headquarters>. Later at the CID *Headquarters>, around February I was shown a chit purportedly in my name authorising withdrawal of money from an account from HFCK. I see the chit in question here in court. It is not dated. It is addressed to the banking manager HFCK. It purports to be in my name and *siganture>. The signature is not mine. The identity card No. quoted there on is No. 1728399/64 which is the number of my old identity card. The writing on this chit is not mine, neither the signature (chit marked Mfl 2). I now see a cash withdrawal slip dated 5.1.93 purporting to be in my name and signatures. It is not in my writing. The address quoted there on is 30050 which is not mine. I use my personal post box No. 61581 NAIROBI. The official one I hardly use for my personal transaction. I *dont> even know it off head. The withdrawal slip for *shs.> 75,000/- (withdrawal slip marked MFl 3). I did not authorise anyone to withdraw money at HFCK. My account number is 1/44431 at HFCK which is different from a/c. No 1/10/200 on the withdrawal slip. My account was intact. There was no interference. I wish to produce the abstract and receipt as exhibits herein (marked Exb. 1). The name <name/> on the withdrawal slip is not known to me. I do not know the accused. I have never seen him. Neither do I know the owner account No 1/01/200. I have only one account No. 1/44431 with H.F.C.K now.

P.W. 2 <name/> S/S IN ENGLISH
I work with HFCK as assistant banking manager. I am *incharge> of opening new accounts authorising withdrawals, supervision etc. I do recall on 6.1.93 one of my officers reported to me that a customer had called in for a transaction. She wanted a cheque processed. It was for *shs.> 200,000/- The customer left and returned the next day. She came to the same officer <name/> and said that her account showed a debit of *shs.> 60,000/- which she was not aware of. I got this information from Ali Bwana on 7.1.93. The customer was in our office. I talked to her. She maintained she had not withdrawn *shs.> 60,000/- from her account. She held a joint account with her husband. The customer was <name/>, her husband <name/>. The couple had an account No. 1/2016. I told the customer to leave me with copies of the passbook to investigate the matter. I started investigations. Our officer <name/> remembered a transaction for *shs.> 75,000/- done on 5.1.93 which had been debited from account 1/1200. The original owner of this account is one <name/>. When I checked I discovered the name <name/> had been altered in the computer system to read <name/>. I called for the withdrawal slip for the 5.1.93 transaction, so too the register. Whenever there is a change in any account it must be recorded in our register for change such changes must be supported by evidence e.g. gazettement marriage certificate. The change in this case was reflected in the computer printout of 5.1.93. I see the printout in question for 5.1.93. It is a copy which I have certified. The printout shows that the account was now reverting to the name <name/> from <name/>. I could not get the initial printout which changed the account name from (Mfl 4A) <name/> to <name/> though I looked. This particular change was done after the *shs.> 75,000/- had been withdrawn from the account. I also recovered another document - daily transaction (Mfl 4B) check list for 5.1.93. This shows that account No. 1/1200 *wad> debited with *shs.> 75,000/- and that it was then in the name of <name/>, which name appeared on the withdrawal form used to withdraw (Mfl 3 id) (change form printout Mfl 4A, Transaction list Mfl 4B) I also saw a letter authorising withdrawal form the said account (Mfl 2 id). The payment is *shs.> 75,000/- was paid by Miss <name/>. The payee was <name/> being the title of the account at the time but the actual *receipient> was <name/>, as per the withdrawal slip and authorising chit (Mfl2). He signed on the withdrawal form at the rear.
After getting this information I contacted <name/> who denied having operated the account No. 1/1200. He however told me he had lost his identity card sometimes in December 1992. <name/> was our employee working in the computer room. We questioned him. We asked him to bring to us <name/>, but he was unable to. The matter was then reported to the police. <name/> is the accused *Identified>.
In the case of a change of names once documents for change are lodged with us; the information is authorised by an officer in the register. The name will be changed and the change will be entered in the computer and will be reflected in a document like Mfl 1 4A at the end of the day.

P.W. 3 MRS. <name/> S/S IN ENGLISH
I work with HFCK *AS A BANk> cashier. I do recall on 25.1.93 at 4.00 p.m. I was about to close when a *memeber> of staff came with a withdrawal slip for a customer who was said to have come late. The staff member is <name/> (Accused identified). This is the withdrawal slip he had (Mfl 3 id). He also had a savings book for the same customer and identity. I asked for authority to collect for the customer. Accused produced a letter authorising him to collect (Mfl 2 id.) I needed to consult my seniors regarding the payment. I was authorised by <name/> and <name/> to pay. <name/> is the first officer. He sent me to the 2nd officer <name/>. He allowed me to pay a payment of over *shs.> 5,000/- must be authorised in writing. Both signed on the withdrawal slip Mfl2 (shown) to authorise the payment to our member of staff. When the accused gave me the letter authorising him to collect on a customer's behalf I went back and asked <name/> and <name/> whether to pay. They  send><+_said> since it was a member of staff I should pay. I went back and the accused wrote his name and signed at the rear of the withdrawal form (Mfl 2-shown) I paid the accused *shs.> 75,000/-. He was working in the computer room as an operator.
We have four people working in the computer room.
<name/>
Xxd by *Accused>: When you brought Mfl 3 the signatures of <name/> and <name/> were already there. I however sought authority for them to allow me pay you on behalf of the customer. You gave me the letter authorising you to collect on behalf of the customer  whom><+_who> you said was outside. I did not see him.
<name/>
P.W. 4 <name/> S/S IN ENGLISH
I work with HFCK as banking officer in charge of operations. I oversee the identification of customers, computer operations, authorising payments over *shs.> 1,000/-.
I do recall on 7.1.93 at about 3.30 p.m. a member of the staff in computer room *bought> me a passbook register, withdrawal slip, identity card and specimen signature card of the account holder. *He> accused said the customer was his friend and he wanted me to authorise payment as it was past 3.00 p.m. and we had closed. I compared the signatures and identification documents. I sent him to the *Assistant> banking manager (O.P) Mr. <name/>.
Later P.w. 2 came and said she would not pay the *shs.> 75,000/- as the customer was not there. She said <name/> had shown her a better authorising withdrawal on behalf of the customer. I said she should not pay if she could not see the customer. Accused insisted he was authorised. I sent them to go to Mr. <name/> my boss and if he was allowed he could be paid. My boss *overrulled> me and <name/> was paid. A few days later a customer came and said her account had been debited for *shs.> 75,000/- at a time she was out of the country. I sent for the voucher authorising the payment and noticed it was not Mr. <name/>'s signature. To me it looked forged  whats><+_what's> more <name/> was out of the city then. I had seen a copy. I went to see the original voucher itself. I saw it had a cashier's rubber stamp whose number had been rubbed out. One could therefore not tell who paid. A cashier's rubber stamp number is assigned to only one person working at a certain counter. She/He is responsible for it and must keep it safe. The voucher in question had only one authority which was also questionable. I alerted Mr. <name/>. I went to the register and found the *Banking> manager and Miss <name/>. But the  name><+_names> on the voucher differed with those on the register itself. I decided to look at the reports for name changes for this particular account. I found that the names of the account holder had been changed from <name/> and <name/> to <name/> on 1.12.92 and later turned back to the names of the  complainant><+_complainants> who were the genuine account  holder><+_holders>. I alerted my boss.
Later on a withdrawal slip was brought to me in the name of <name/>. When I saw the slip I thought I had seen this name somewhere. I realized this was the same name which had been on documents brought to me earlier. I took a photocopy of the ID. *Card> signature card and authorised payment to the customer. I decided to see if the same method had been used in paying *shs.> 75,000/- as in that of *shs.> 60,000/- I discovered that <name/> was our customer holding a  totalling><+_totally> different account. His name however was used to transfer the name of account No. 1/1200 of <name/> into his name and later revert it to the genuine account holder (see Mfl 4A).
Xxd by Accused: We have a place where we keep documents lost in the bank and one working in the bank would know that and even have access. I did recall that the accused had brought to me the payment voucher for *shs.> 75,000/- (Mfl 3). I authorised payment and gave my signature. He had brought an identity card passbook and specimen *signture>. I retired and upon being satisfied I signed giving my authority. Here is my authority on Mfl 3. This was on 5.1.93. At the bottom of my signature I endorsed (known to <name/>). I did not see the customer but the accused said this was his friend. I thought he had already been identified at the cashier's desk. Later on 5.1.93 the cashier came refusing to pay and I told her not to since a different person was reviewing.

P.W.2 *Duly> sworn in English states
My name is <name/>. I am *Mananging Director> of Private *proximate> Insurance *brokers> Limited. I know the accused *Person> he had approached in early 1989 for *Employment>. He had worked elsewhere in the *Industry> and I requested him to join us on temporary basis pending his performance.
He finally joined us in March 1989 and I assigned him accounts executive. These are the people who attend to clients who come for *Insurance> services.
His main duties were to attend to clients and issue with *Insurance> company to obtain certificates for them.
His performance was good because he is capable but there were things which hindered his permanent employment because we got complaints of previous which he never paid to the *Company>.
In may 1990 I was planning to go to an overseas trip. Two weeks earlier there were </conplaints> regarding these clients were my close friends.
When they came to complain I asked the accused to stop working until I came back from my trip. I suspended the accused.
I came back in June 1990 at around 20th. From London I rang the office and learnt there was a serious problem where a customer had been issued a temporary certificate.
In April 1990 some cover notes had been issued which I had no knowledge of. The client wanted permanent certificate because he had paid the required premiums. I was told the client was told the client was making a lot of noise.
When I came back I realized Mr. <name/> was involved. There was no evidence in my office that the client had paid.
The *clietn> is <name/> who had insured hit two vehicles. I talked to <name/> when I came back and I asked him who he had paid. He told me it was the accused. He produced a note given to him purporting to be receipts (shown MFI I). The amount was *shs.> 11,000/= and the 2nd is *shs.> 21,000/=.
These were in respect of *Motor> vehicles KZH 002 and KAA 788D. The  complainant><+_complainant's> slips did not state what the payments were for.
I recognise these as Mr. <name/>'s hand writing and the signature is his.
The normal procedure is that money is paid to cashier or accountant who issues receipts and we have never run short of the receipts.
I checked and I found no records of Mr. <name/>. I checked from cash sales register.
This is a sales ledger (*Marked> MFI 2). I checked in the month of April and there was no entry of Mr. <name/>.
Mr. <name/> had started coming to our office in April 1990. I wondered why Mr. <name/> paid the money without receipts. I *adviced> him to go and take any action deemed fit. Including reporting to CID for further investigations. I reported to C.I.D *Headquarters>.
I later recorded a statement but as I did not want my *Company> to be maligned I wanted the matter investigated.
My assistant *Manager> is <name/>. I called Mr. <name/> and I paid him money and this was a big loss to my *Company>. Because of the complication the matter of the accused's employment was left pending. He is still suspended.
I talked to the accused BBBto the accusedRRR I requested him to come and see me. He came once after the C.I.D. went to his place but we did not discuss anything.

You joined us in 1989. Your letter of application is dated February 1989. I asked you to start working in March 1989.

Early last year I was at *blue shield> as assistant *General Manager> In May 1990 around 23rd one <name/> came to our office looking for <name/>. He was brought to me as <name/> had been sacked. When I asked his problem he said he had given <name/> Kshs. 21,00/= for a certificate of *Insurance>.
Our records did not show his names. The proposals were not <O/> (shown MFI 3).
I told Mr. <name/> that could not assist him because he was not in the register. He told me he had completed slips which were at his house.
I instructed our driver to take <name/> to his place or work so that he could come with the slips. They came with two completed slips for Kshs. 11,000/= and Kshs. 10,000 respectively.
Shown MFI I and 2 states:- They are these ones. Having proved that money was received by a proximate I gave the client a 14 day cover note until the *Managing Director> resumes. The *Managing Director> had gone abroad.
I ran after the accused and when I got hold of him he said he went with accused's records by mistake.
He promised to bring them but never did so up to the time I left *proximate>.
When the certificate expired I gave 14 days cover note until our *Managing Director> arrived and I informed him accordingly.
The compliments slips are not the ones we issued. We had receipts Mr. told me he was told the receipts were out of stock. The receipts were not out of stock when they are out of stock I am usually informed but this was not done.
The accused is present in court (identified). He was working as an accounts *Executive>. His work consisted of quoting premium but not receiving money.

I stated the total is *shs.> 21,000/=. Both were signed by <name/> and rubber stamp of *proximate> Insurance.
I went to *proximate> Insurance and I checked sales ledger for January 1990. The register is marked MFI 7.
According to the entries in May and April there was no record telling whether Mr. <name/> was their client. Mr. <name/> had confirmed to me that when he was dealing with <name/> he had opened a file. We could not trace the file.
On 26th of the same month I went to look for the suspect at Eastleigh; I was accompanied by late Inspector <name/>. We did not get the accused. The following day we agreed with <name/> that we meet at Eastleigh and he was to come with a car.

*There> were not in the office. You were called from your house but you did not turn up.
It is not true that I am telling the court things I was told. I told you when I came to your house to accompany me to C.I.D Headquarters.
The non-handwritten standard documents were removed from your house.
The accused duly sworn states
My name is <name/>. I am not working. I live at Eastleigh section II Nairobi. I *jointed> *proximate> Insurance *brokers> on 8.12.88 as senior accounts executive. My responsibilities included licensing with *Insurance> cause for policy *implimentation> providing ..... to clients.
I joined company at request of *Managing Director> on or before 26.4.90 a Mr. <name/> of Concord Insurance told me about a *lient> by the name <name/> who could not raise his full premium of his two matatus.
After *dispending> the pool the *Insurance> cause had option of fixing their own premiums for P.S.V Mvs and as such Mr. <name/> would not continue *Insuring> with concord because premiums had increased on 26.4.90 I was informed by receptionist that there was client. I came out and I was given a note by Mr. <name/> from Mr. <name/>. We moved into my office. Mr. <name/> told me what his problem was and since he had briefed me I went ahead and asked him to complete a proposal form which would be the basis of the *Insurance> contract.
He told me that he had only Kshs. 11,000/= in cash. The total amount to be paid for insuring both motor vehicles was *shs.> 43,000/=. He had done shopping and these were best rates.
After discussing I filled proposal form. The complainant went through the forms and he signed.
After that I gave him 14 days cover note. *Themoney> was acknowledged by completing slip.
This was because as was well known to him PSV *Premiums> are *payale> directly to *Insurance> company and a broker would only get commission.
In providing compl. slip I would give client confidence that the money was in proper hands since the money was not receivable to us.
Mr. <name/> was to come with before *expirey> of the 14 days. He came prior to *expirly> of cover note and there I was a bit busy with *Managing Director>. So he passed a word for some time when I came out briefly I was told he was there he gave me *shs.> 10,000/= at the reception. I took a compl. from the receptionists and I acknowledged and he was to come back the next day or after two days. He was to come with more money.

They then drove to unit 3. We followed. On arrival found them picking a lady. From *inter> arrivals to unit 3 is 50 metres. He took us 3 minutes to get to unit 3.
When I caught up with them they were picking up the lady. We ordered them out after they had picked up the lady.
 Its><+_It's> not true the complainant and the accused had already alighted from the taxi when I was arresting them.
>From unit 2 to 3 is 30 metres. It went round to unit 1 2 and 3 we just took the short cut. The taxi arrived before us. I saw it as it arrived. I saw the lady being picked up when we were still about 50 metres. It should be about 30 metres away. We continued walking towards the taxi.
It is not true that I am lying. The complainant gave me the passports The wife lady passenger gave me her passport. The male passenger also gave me his *passenger>. I did not take the passports from the accused. I did not interview the accused. I took him to the station. The accused did not tell me that complainant was under arrest. It is not true I wanted to release the passenger and arrest only accused. I am the one who stopped the taxi driving off. I ordered them out. I entered the taxi and drove to the police station.
At unit 3 the complainant told us that accused was demanding U$ 200 from him. It is not true I took P.W. I aside after accused told me he was under arrest and that whatever we discussed nobody heard.
At the station I searched the accused on him I found an *Immgration> stamp it was hidden it was just in the pocket. They are not allowed to walk with the stamps. I am sure of this. I recovered money from accused and some  document><+_documents> I did not check them. I took  accused><+_accused's> movement pass. It is at the police station.

Cross examined by <name/>
I was alone when I was tipped. I went behind the aerodromes and went to unit 3. I met the men and lady behind the aerodromes security *Office> this was before they went to *Unit> 3.
I did not *adually> enquire what they were doing. I wanted to enquire but they moved away. The truth is that I did not enquire. I was about to enquire when they moved off.
They were taking behind the aerodromes office. They were having an argument. The complainant took money from his pocket and separated. They moved off. I followed them to *Unit> 3. I was about 10 metres behind them. I wanted to know why complainant was *separation> his money. I did not stop them.

They came out of the taxi. They loaded the luggage. Lady entered. I am not lying when the taxi was being loaded we were a distance away. They were about to take off after loading that we stopped them.
The accused and complainant were not just coming out of the taxi when we arrested them they had arrived, loaded and were about to take off when we arrested him.  Complained><+_Complainant> said accused wanted US 200/= so that he could stamp his *pass port>. Accused was there when complainant said so.
The accused was very rude and aggressive. He refused to talk to us. He never told us that the complainant was under  arrested><+_arrest>. He talked to us the police station.
Accused never told me he had arrested the complainant.
We are not the ones who forced accused and complainant into the taxi and to the *Police Station>.
It is not true I wanted to release the complainant despite accused having told me that we were under arrest.
Recorded statement on what I have told the court this is my statement. I sign it. I was not lying when I said the taxi was about to leave. When he arrested them. I produce my statement into court D. Exh. 2.

I stay in Eastleigh section 1. I work at the Kenya *polytechnic> as a clerk. I know <name/> he used to be my boyfriend. We were friends between July, 1990 to September, 1991.
>From September, 1991 to July, 1992 I cannot recall how often we met. <name/> is here (identify accused). We intended to get married. We had made arrangements towards marriage. We went to the extent of having a pre-wedding in September, 1991 at Eastleigh community centre. This is a copy of the pre-wedding card. It was on 30.8.91 at Eastleigh *Community> centre. The pre-wedding took place Mfl 1. We were not staying together then. I was living in Eastleigh and the accused in Jericho. We differed in September, 1991 and we did not meet again until July, 1992. On 4.7.92 at 8.00 a.m. I was in my house when the accused came. I was alone in my house. I had just woken up. The door to my house was open. I was seated in bed. He pushed the door open and entered.

This is the panty I had that day of the incidence Mfl.2. I gave it to the police on 6th when I was taken to the doctor. I was injured. I had injuries on the thighs. My legs also ached. I saw <name/> again at the police station. Between October, 1991 and July, 1992 the accused never came to my house. I knew house of the accused at Jericho when we were still friends.

On 4.7.92 I arrived from Mombasa where I had gone for a business trip. I arrived early in the morning. I went to  complainants><+_complainant's> house. I had given her father dowry of 28 goats and I wanted them to be refunded. I went to  complainants><+_complainant's> house that morning because the complainant had told her father that I owed her 1,500/-. I went there to pay her the money. I paid her the money. She then escorted me to my car which was parked near a bar. I stayed in her house between 5 to 10 minutes. Her house is in Mathare along *juja road> near St. Teresa. The complainant voluntarily escorted me to my vehicle, which was 200 metres from her house. I found the complainant's house locked and I had to knock for her to open. *Infact> as I stood waiting I spoke to a neighbour of hers. The complainant was wearing a night dress but on seeing me she wore a lesso. Her house is one roomed. She has stools for chairs. The complainant welcomed me into her house and offered to make tea for me which I declined as I wanted to go home and rest. I was arrested on 23rd August, 1992, at Kangundo. I mean I was found at Kangundo by police officer on 21st August, and I reported to Pangani police station on 23rd August. No blood was taken from me.

Between 1990 and 1991 I could see signs of her smoking but on questioning her she always denied. She visited me after the pre-wedding and I found cigarettes in her hand-bag. I even went and told her father. Between September, 1991 and July, 1992 we were not meeting. She had given me the money in April, 1991. I gave the money back to her after a year. I was hoping we would reconcile  thats><+_that's> why I never paid her. We used to meet between September, 1991 and July, 1992 but briefly. Yes, we used to discuss about the money but I *post phoned> the payment. I would say she had no need for the money, she just wanted us to reconcile. Her father told me about the money through elders whom I had sent to get back my dowry. The father told them to tell me to repay  complainants><+_complainant's> money first. I had sent the elders often between November, 1991 and July, 1991. The goats paid as dowry is not valued in monetary terms traditionally. The value of goats was more than 1,500/-. Yes, I was claiming more from them than they were from me. Since parting in September, 1991 to *july>, 1992 we had no serious disagreements between us. I came to know <name/> here in court. When I visited  complainants><+_complainant's> house I never even saw <name/> there. I *dont> know her at all. I would say she had been told to come here and say what she did. I did not know names of  complainants><+_complainant's> neighbours but I knew them facially. I would say that the complainant made this complaint because she learnt that I was planning to marry another woman. Her house,  complainants><+_complainant's>, had a bed, cupboard and stools.

<name/>
Submissions by counsel.
Doubt as to whether the statements were voluntary. There were cells which were available but  accuseds><+_accused> were detained in general office which was in use. If there were 3 inspectors why did only one *Insp.> take statements In other trial within - a trial. It was held that insp. *Knew> circumstances of case. In other trial within a trial,  accuseds><+_accused> were kept in office - purposes of beating. I urge that the other insp. had taken statements of accused 2 just minutes before which was highly prejudicial.
<name/>
Ct: Room at 2.30 p.m.
Later:
Ruling: Irregular for same officer to take charge and cautionary statement from both accused but not prejudicial so statement can be admitted.

P. W. 8 A MALE ADULT SWORN AND STATES:
I am No. 26236 IP <name/> attached to Parklands police station. On 30/8/90 at about 11.00 a.m. I was at the police station when I was asked by the D.C.I.O. *PARKlands> SP <name/> to conduct an I/D parade. The parade was done in a yard next to the OGS office.

He was identified and he was satisfied and he signed and I countersigned. I abided by rules and first page. I now produce it in court as an exhibit (produced). I also conducted a parade for <name/> on 16/9/90. There was one witness, <name/>. There were 8 members of the parade and the suspect stood between position *223> and he was identified. He was satisifed and he signed and I countersiged. I followed the rules on page 2. I now wish to produce it to court as an exhibit. (produced). In all the cases they were identified by being *torched> on the shoulder. All those suspects are the 3 accuseds.

3  accuseds><+_accused> present
Mr. <name/> for first accused present and states in *sumbisssions.>: The 3  accuseds><+_accused> are jointly charged with the offence of *Robbery>. From the evidence of PW I the complainant she stated that she never saw any of the 3  accuseds><+_accused> and further that whoever went to the house only threatened to use force but no force was used. PW 3 only saw a GK *M/V> which belongs to the police and never saw the thieves.

None *ofthe> witnesses who attended the ID *Parade> were either not called or were not at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has not established a prima facie case to warrant first accused being put on his defence and I urge the court to acquit him under section 210 of the CPC.
Prosecutor:
The prosecution *hasestahlished> a prima facie case. The evidence on record is *sufficent> to put the accused on their defence and they should be put on their  defences><+_defence>.
Defences:
a) First accused will make unsworn statement and states: 
My name is *Learned> <name/>. I stay at South B, police lines. I work as a P.C. driver on 30/8/90 I went on duty at *Central Workshop> at 8.a.m. The police took me to South B where I showed them my house. They identified themselves and wanted to carry out a search in my *hoose>. I told the OC in charge to be around and he came and he was there when the search was conducted. They then took me to Parklands police station where I was taken to the *cells.> and detained till IP.M. When IP <name/> came and asked me if I had gone to an Asian's place on 27th a Monday I explained to her that I did not go there as I was working on that day. I was then taken to an ID *Parade> where my ex-cellmates identified me. The police m/v is normally signed for *whereever> it leaves the premises for an errand. I was only going to hospital at Forces Memorial *hospital> to see my boss - Mr. <name/>. I frequently visited him in hospital. But none of my identifing witnesses testified as to what I had allegedly done. Even the complainant herself denied having seen nor known me. I do not know the 2nd and 3rd  accusess><+_accused>. No m/v entered her home. The  watchmen><+_watchman> only said that he saw a m/v pass.
No witnesses to call.
b) 2nd accused person has elected to make a sworn statement sworn and states:
My name is <name/>. I stay at Pangani. I work in my father's shop at Pangani. On 13/9/90 at about 10.a.m. at the High *court> two officers came and asked me to accompany them to Parklands police station. I went with them to Parklands police station where I was remanded on arrival. On 5th day a ID parade was held. 3 people were brought and they identified me, but I had been with them in the cells. Finally I was charged with these offences. No witnesses to call.
Cross-examined by prosecutor:
3 people identified me at Parklands police station. and all the 3 people had been with me in the cells. Even PW 2 a young Asian was in the cells but I do not know what offence he was being charged with. The Asian said he knew me in the cells. I did not tie her with a rope.
c) 3rd accused person has elected to make unsworn statement and states: My name is <name/>. I stay at Pangani. I used to work for the complainant. On 30th I went on duty as usual till 10.00 a.m. when I heard a noise of PW I as I was in *thek> kitchen. I met her PW I with 3 people who caught me as they had caught her and we were made to sit down and tied. They ransacked the house and left with one *brief case> and bag. They left telling us not to leave. The police came at 3 p.m. I told the police that I had no relative working with the police. I worked till 6 p.m. When I reported off on next day I worked till 6 p.m. On the 3rd day as I was working at about 3.30 p.m. 2 officers came and asked me if I knew the robbers and I *deneid>. They took me to the police station where I recorded statements. I was forced to sign statements. 2 men were brougth from the cells and it was alleged that I had been planning with them and I denied.
Finally I was brought to court and charged.
No witnesses to call.
Mr. <name/>:
The 3  accuseds><+_accused> are charged with the offence of robbery. The evidence on record so far points to the innocence of  accuseds><+_accused>. PW I and PW 2 stated that they did not see first accused and yet the robbery took place at 10.00 a.m. during the day. PW 3 said he had seen a police *m.v> along the road and later heard that there was theft. But he never saw anybody himself; nor anybody *alighing> from the police m/v go to the house.
P.W. 4 in cross examination said he did not know those who told him there was a theft. She only produced a work ticket which says the car was supposed to be moving in Nairobi. First accused has given a *plainsible> explanation as to where he went. PW 8 who conducted an ID parade said that first accused was identified by 2 people who were never summoned to testify and they both feature *nowehere> in the proceedings. The evidence on record cannot assist the court in convicting first accused.

On 28.7.87 I was in the office at about 11.30 a.m. when the accused was brought to me and I took his statement under inquiry. At 3.20 p.m. he volunteered and took me to the scene of the accident where I took the road view. This is the one MFI. 1, it was along Juja road, and near Meru Rutuna bar and lodging.

Externally, right thigh bone was broken. A 2 cm. cut above right eye. Right side of head was bruised. Right side of skull was broken. Internally, there was bleeding over the right side of the brain. I formed the opinion that the cause of death was due to bleeding over *gith> side of the brain due to a broken skull consistent with a road traffic accident. A blood sample was submitted to government chemist. I then completed and signed a post mortem form which I now wish to produce as an exhibit (2). This is the report from *Government> analyst (3).
xx. by Mr. <name/>:- This is the report I received from the *Government> analyst. He had taken a minimum of 9 whiskies. It depends on capacity and tolerance on individual.

Prosecutor: This is the close of the case.

P.W.I NO.48871 P.C. <name/> SWORN STATES:-
I am attached to Pangani Police station. On 3/10/91 I reported on duty at 6.00 p.m. and was to work till morning.
We then went with other officers on duty at Eastleigh. We started with section 2. And near Mateso Bila Chuki Bar, we came, 2 people singing crossing the road. When we saw them the driver stopped the lorry and we arrested them for being drunk and disorderly.
While on the lorry they were singing and shouting that "Nyayo juu", serikali juu" and that we were arresting them because of the Ford meeting. At the police station, we charged them with the offences. While in cells they continued to bang on the doors. We left them in cells to await the O.C.S. I had not known the 2 accused persons before. They are the 2 in court.
xxd. by <name/>:-
When I first saw the  accuseds><+_accused> they were singing "Nyayo juu, KANU Government juu.". They were crossing the road from one side to the other. Both of them were staggering, we felt that accused No.1 with his staggering, he could be hit by a motor vehicle.
AI did not tell us that he had a problem with his legs, after being injured during the struggle for *intependence>.
I believe the other people on the lorry also saw them. When we booked them we did so for being drunk. I do not know if I was brought to court on 14/10/91. I have been in the force for 6 years. For an offence like this one, the suspects should have been brought to court on the following day or after 2 or 3 days.
I am not aware of any <*/haklas compus> order made by the High *court> which made him to be brought to court charged with this offence.
I can see this order of the High Court in an application No. 451/91. It is in respect of AI and was issued on 11/10/91.
I do not know if he was charged to defeat the order of the High *court>. Both  accuseds><+_accused> told us that we were arresting them so that they could not go to the meeting on 5/10/91 at Kamukunji.
I have said that they said this at the time of arrest. We arrested them for being drunk. AI did not tell us that he is a KANU life member. He showed us no card to that effect. None of us tore the card. It is us police officers and the people we had arrested who heard what he was saying.
With me I could not be disturbed by what they said. The people we had arrested and were in the lorry were about 15.
A cell can hold a maximum of about 40 people. We put both  accuseds><+_accused> in a cell with other people. A cell has a door and a small window through which you can see (through).
The accused are the ones who were banging the door, we left them still beating on the door.
xxd. by A2:- I was not the cell sentry and I do not know if any of the people who came to see you were chased away.
xxr:- None.
<name/>
P.W.2 NO. 51210 P.C. <name/> ALI SWORN STATES:-
I am attached to Pangani Police station.
On 3/10/91 while with other police officers we went to patrol at Eastleigh. While on 2nd Avenue near Mateso Bila Chuki we saw 2 people staggering along the road. We then stopped and arrested them.
On the lorry AI started shouting "Moi Juu Serikali ya Kanu juu". He said this so that he could be set free. A2 was also shouting the same thing.
At the station AI told A2 that these people are *priting> us in cells so that they could not attend the Kamukunji meeting.
They then kept on shouting and banging on the cell door. I can see AI. The other *on> I cannot recall him well.
xxd. by <name/>:-
AI was staggering on the road. It was not in the usual way walking. I did not know his usual way of walking.
I did not see which direction he was going. I heard AI say that they were being arrested to prevent them from attending the meeting at Kamukunji. I did not take this seriously. I did not bother to know his manner of his walking.
AI did not show me a KANU life membership card. I do not know if he showed it to any other officer. I did not see any KANU *badage>.
I booked them for being drunk and disorderly. I do not know when they were taken to court.
I can see this High Court order. I do not know if they were taken to court to defeat the habeas corpus order. I was not there when they were taken to court.
XXR:- None
<name/>
C/P:- That is the close of our case.
<name/>:- I submit no case is made out to put the accused on their defence.
The evidence is clear that they were walking on the road shouting "Nyayo Juu, KANU Government Juu". These words even shouted on a road or a *Police> station cannot be any offensive words.
This is the slogan of the day even in meetings attended by the president.
With regard to the staggering, AI has a walking problem. A2 did admit this. Thirdly, there is evidence that P.W.2 never took it seriously when AI said that they were being arrested to prevent them from attending the meeting. This is not inciting.
There is no evidence to confirm who shouted and banged the cell door when there were other prisoners there. Accused should be acquitted and the case dismissed under section 210 C.P.C.
C/P:- There is ample evidence adduced. Accused have a case to answer.
P.W.I stated that the reason for the arrest is that they were walking on the road dangerously in view of the traffic on the road. It is not because of shouting. They were drunk to the point of being incapable of controlling themselves.
As stated by P.W.2 they continued to shout and also banged the cell door. Their other behaviour, they were also charged because of the shouting and banging the door. Nobody took what they said to be an offence but their conduct.

P.W. 1 <name/> M/a/s/states.
I am assistant personnel manager at International Casino. I am in charge of security. I have been in charge of security for 16 years. On 27.2.93 at about 1.00 a.m. the accused was brought to the office. He is a dealer, a trainee dealer. They chip the ball at the gaming room at the casino. He was therefore and employee of the casino. He was brought by one of the bouncers <name/>. I was told he had stolen 12 chips worth Kshs 6,000/- each is worth 500/-) It is the security man who had the chips. The security man told me the accused is to leave the chips at the table and not remove them. As the accused was going for tea, he was suspected to have stolen the chips as one inspector <name/> said he had seen the accused stealing the chips from the table, and that as he was going for tea he was approached and he dropped the chips down and was arrested and brought to security office together with the exhibits. I asked the accused whether he had stolen and he admitted and I told him to write that down and he did. I then rang Parklands police station and he was arrested and I handed them over to police as exhibits. These are the chips (12) MFI 1). They each value at 500/-. I have worked with the accused for all over 6 years. In the course of that period we have never disagreed.
YYD by the accused.
The bouncer who brought you was holding the chips and you were with him. You also came with Inspector<name/>. I have a copy of the statement you wrote. I can show the court. It is here (court shown). I was not aware you were removed from one table to another. I was not there when you were arrested.
Re-examination: Nil.
P.W. 2 <name/> M/a/s/states.
I am an employee of International Casino. I do security work. On the night of 26/2/93 I was on duty. At 12.50 a.m. while on duty I was patrolling around the gaming room, I was called by <name/> and inspector who supervises the dealers.
10.10 a.m. Defence counsel walks into court.
Court: The court reads out the evidence on record to the counsel.
<name/> called me at a loud sound and he told me "<name/> arrest that person". That person was the accused, he was not in the room. He had left the room and moved 15 paces away. The accused had handed over duty to some one else. I hurriedly towards the accused and on seeing me he tried to hurry off and I quickened my steps and as I was going to hold him he threw the chips down and tried to ran off but I held him and I collected the chips and took the accused to the security office. I know the accused is not allowed to leave with the chips. He is supposed to leave them with the supervisor at the table. I have worked with the accused for over 5 years but we have not disagreed. This are the chips (MFI 1).
CC by defence counsel.
The accused was on a table called Black Jack. I do not know how many tables a dealer attends to. There is only one dealer on each table. When a dealer goes for break, there is someone who comes to replace him. There is a lady who replaced the accused. I do not know her. I know the accused was not going to another table. He was going for break. He was from the tables. I am sure he was going for break. He was heading towards the staff door for break. I did collect the chips from where the accused threw them. I collected the chips from the floor. The only other person who saw me arrest the accused was one Dickson. I did not see anything else. It is not true the accused was changing from one table to another. I am convinced the accused was going for break. The accused was walking on but on seeing me, walked faster.
Re-examination: Nil.
P.W. 3 <name/> m/a/s/states.
I work for International Casino as a Gaming Inspector. My main duties are to supervise games. In doing that work we do dealers for Black Jack. On the 26/2/93 in the night I was on duty and at 12.50 a.m. I was inspecting tables. Three and four one dealer <name/> was on table 4. Rotationally a dealer moves from table 4 to three and takes an allowed break as he arranges with the management. There was action of table No. 4. Table No. 3 was empty. At that time <name/> was to move from Table 4 to three. I was seated in between the table, facing the tables. I suddenly heard a "hack" sign and I got attracted and I looked around and realised the chips on the tray had been scooped off. I saw the accused move to table three and I asked him what had happened and he told me in Kiswahili <quote/>
I told him I cannot entertain that rubbish and I went for the accused who started struggling with me and I called <name/> a bouncer and as <name/> came back, the accused realised, all was not well and he tried to throw the chips back but <name/> had gotten hold of him. I stopped the game on table 4 together with <name/> we picked the chips he had dripped. The accused had dropped 12 chips. They are valued at Kshs 500/- each, totalling Kshs 6000/_. If I had not struggled fast, the accused would have thrown them out. He threw them and they landed on the table. They landed on table No. 4. We took the accused and the chips to the manager's office. These are the chips which the accused had stolen (MFI1).
The tables are just next to each other. When a dealer changes tables, and has been given a break, he has to clap and open his hands to show that he has not taken any chips and I would confirm. It is a procedure the accused knows and its in writing. When a dealer leaves one table to another he is not allowed to move with the chips.
XXD by the defence counsel.
We give gaming supervisor according to the operational tables we have gaming officers from the Govt. They only come to check on tax. There was no Govt. gaming supervisor there. There was a dealer <name/> on Table No. 3. It was <name/> who was going for break. It was the accused to replace <name/> on table 3. <name/> was to replace the accused on table 4. The accused was taking a break to table 3 as there was no action on table 3. The procedure of clapping hands was introduced three years ago. It is in writing. I do not have a copy of the same. The chips fell on the table. Table No. 4 none of the chips fell on the floor. I have worked with the accused for long. I am not aware of him having been involved in such a case before. The accused was serving only 4 customers. The customers got chips from the dealer who sells to them. He of course is in custody of those chips.
Re-examination.
There was a struggle when we were arresting the accused. The struggle was towards table 3 which is towards the door.
C/P. I wish to apply for an adjournment for re-arresting officer <name/>. He is on leave. I do not know when he returns. I apply for an adjournment.
Counsel: I have no objection.
Court: Reallocation in court No. 1 on 7/2/94.

C/P. I am not ready. This is a  partheard> case, the remaining witness <name/> is on leave, he went before being bonded. He resumes on 15/10/94. I request for an adjournment.
Counsel. I object to the application. The same reason was used on 14/4/94. The investigating officer was absent. The court gave the prosecution the last adjournment. The defence is anxious to finalise this case. It has been  ponding> since 1993. The accused is unable to get a job anywhere. I request the court to reject the application.
Court: Ruling on the 11.10.94
Ruling. The prosecution has been given several adjournment in this matter to avail their witnesses in court but have failed to do so. The witness in question is a police officer who should be easily availed in court. The reasons given by the prosecution are not satisfactory. I therefore give the prosecution a last chance and a further two weeks, a period within which to avail the remaining witness in court or close their case. The case will be heard on the 10./10/94.
Court: The court ruling in this matter is clear the prosecution have been given several chances to avail their witnesses in court but in vain. The case cannot be adjourned indefinitely. I reject further adjournment to the prosecution.
C/P. I have not received the police file. It was with another officer this morning and he has disappeared. I request for the case to be put aside.
Counsel. The file should have been in court. The Pros. have been dragging with the matter in this case.
Court: The court's ruling over the prosecution adjournments is clear. The court has ruled against any further adjournment.
C/P. This is a  partheard> case it had a total of 5 witnesses. Three of them testified. I pray the case be withdrawn under section 87(a) C.P.O.
Counsel: When the case came up all the witnesses were in court. We are only waiting for one witness. Time again the matter has been adjourned by the prosecution. The defence is convinced the prosecution has no evidence to offer. It would be prejudicial to the accused if the matter is withdrawn. We request for a complete acquittal.
Court: Ruling on the 7/11/94.
Court: The case has gone to such an advanced stage and indeed the witness the prosecution has failed to call is a police officer who should be easily available in court. The case has been dragging on since Feb. to Nov. and the prosecution have failed to call him. I therefore reject the prosecution application as they are trying to go around the court orders.
Court: The application is rejected.
C/P. That is the close of the prosecution case.

I am called <name/>. I work with DC's office Kitui as a Higher Clerical officer. My work includes being in charge of data section on 13.10.93. I was in my office at the Date office when an inspector came to look for an official receipt. The District officer allowed me to give out a copy of the same I remained with the duplicate and the police officer went with the photocopy then I wrote a statement. This is the receipt No AN778788 dated 26.9.91 for Kshs. 10/= MFI 4 referred to. This is also receipt No. AN 778788 dated 22.8.91 it is for Kshs. 50,000. It also have a stamp as paid. The other copy MFI 4 is not stamped but MFI 3 is stamped. MFI 1 4 originates from the District *Vertinary> officer at Kitui. The in charge then was not known to me.
P.W. 4 Cross-examined by counsel:
In our office I do not have the original. It bears the duplicate  copy of this photocopy. Police do not come for it. I do not have the book copy. In the receipt are 3 copies. Original duplicate and *tripulicate>. The duplicate is there in the district office. There should be records of which department was issued with the person from where this receipt have been recovered. I did not go to check who was issued with the book. This was supported by a *reguisition> order signed by the District *vertary> officer. The inspector of police did not have MFI 3 but he had the number for the duplicate. I saw MFI 3 when I was recording my statement. In the original receipt it was issued and particulars of purchase stated. I do not know who bought the drugs or where they were bought.
Re-examination
Yes the police officer showed me this number of MFI 4. I do not have the duplicate and not the original of MFI4.
P. W. 5 ON OATH:
I am called <name/>. I work with *verternary> department Kitui as a *Reverve> clerk. My duties includes accounts and receive taking in the DC's office. When we cannot receive we take it to the examiner at the DC's office and we are given a receipt after we have paid in. When an individual comes to me for purchase he goes through the stores and he buys. We then gave him a receipt. At times I write the receipt because we are 3 of us. I then receive the money. We place the money at the safe and later to the DC's office. In October 1991 somebody came and brought drugs medicine. He is the Mulinge. He bought medicine of monies I cannot remember. I think he was issued with a receipt. On MFI 4 have a name Mulinge. It is AM 778788. It is dated 26.10.91. It is for Kshs. 10/= the item bought is written down reads out MFI 4. Police came to me and showed me another receipt. It is this one Number AM 778788 dated 22.8.91 It is for Kshs. 50,000/= MFI 3. I said I had never seen this receipt. They wrote a statement I went away. I did not issue MFI 3. I did not remember the date on the receipt. He showed me amount and the receipt number. I wrote a statement at the police. It was read over to me. I signed it. This is my signature. This one this one and this one. Yes this receipt as shown to me. I  was asked if I knew the writing but I said I did not. In my office at the particular period we were using this receipt number. There were 3 books in the office then. The book with the number of this receipt the book was one Mukuti. I cannot remember the book number that particular time. This receipt is MFI 3 and MFI 4 the same number but are quite different. I did not receive the Kshs. 50,000/=. If I had received it I could have issued a receipt of the same. I have never seen a time we got receipts with same numbers.
P. W. on Oath cross-examined by counsel:
I have been an accounts clerk since 1966. This is about 27 years ago. Over the period I have never seen such a book with similar numbers yet differing particular. I said this book was used by somebody else. I did not write this receipt. I did I cannot say this is my handwriting or not because the original is not there. The writing looks like mine. It reads 26.10.89. We cannot tell whether it is for 26.10.90 or 26.9.91 (shows to the court). MFI 3 ought to be the original of MFI 4. I recollect issuing Mulinge with an original receipt. That original ought to be with Mulinge. In the office the triplicate could be in the office. The police were not asked for the *tripulate> at all. I took the duplicate copy I took to the DC's office. Now I cannot confirm MFI 4 without looking at the one I wrote. We are 4 accounts clerks ie <name/> Myself <name/> and <name/>. If I receive money from <name/>I would have written it on the receipt, below. It is unusual for it to be on top. If the receipt as on MFI 3 *yest> the book AN 778878 was in use on 22.8.91

After that the CID officers took this book. I also wrote my statement - Cash sale receipt book MFI 6. We do not supply *vertinary> medicine to the *vertinary> officers at Kitui.
P. W. cross-examined by counsel:
Yes we found MFI 6 in the Archives. Previously we were not auditing the books. At that time we were not auditing the books. We found the two book copies missing it should be the same number ie 45 to 71556-5 copies are missing. We checked the book and all the 5 copies were missing other than the one the CID officers brought. Yes we discovered all the 6 copies missing. Before the CID officers came we had be been relieved off his own duties so we never traced him. Drugs can be sold to an authorised person ie *Phamacist>, or *vetinary> officer. I do not know whether he was selling his own drugs or not. It is a receipt from our books.

<name/> auditor. I work  with the Ministry of Lands Reclamation and *Reginal> Development, in Nairobi now. I am a planning officer. On 8.10.92 I was in Kitui as a Programme officer for a Development Programme. I know the accused who was the Deputy *Vertinery> officer at the Ministry of Live stole Development. On 8.10.91 it concerns some purchases made by the department. It had asked for money to buy some items, for the department. They had applied for an *imprest>. The receipts have to be handed over to us by the head of the department. I know about some purchase of vaccines in this case. They brought the receipts to surrender the *imprest>. They were passed but later on I heard it was carried and it was indicated they were not in order. After the audit was told to write a statement. I had advised them *imprest> department on the documents submitted. I signed the *imprest> document. I do not remember the amount. Police latter approached me I wrote a statement. I was shown some receipts. These are the receipts MFI 3 and MFI 5. I was not shown this book (MFI 6). AM 778788 is of 22.8.91 and is an official receipt for Kshs. 50,000/=. I remember having cleared the said *imprest> to <name/>. This copy bares the same number dated 26.10.91. It is for Kshs. 10/=. I do not remember seeing MFI 4. Before clearing MFI 3 I checked whether the head of the department had indicated the purchase had been done and if other officers had checked on it and then I checked the *imprest>. Later I learnt the vaccines were not purchased as per the Auditors report.
P. W. 11 cross-examined by counsel:
The *imprest> was *deceared> to me. I received these documents I filled the surrender voucher. I do not know where the voucher is. I have given it to the police. So I am not sure the same was surrendered. There was an *imprest> have one voucher, MFI 5 referred to. It does not bare doctor <name/>'s name. There is a signature at the back. I relied on the voucher which is not in court today. From these documents in court tell *imprest> was given to the accused or who surrendered the same. Police told me <name/> surrendered the *imprest>. They told me the vaccines had not been bought. I cannot know what the vaccine was for. As I stand here I do not know whether any *imprest> was given to the accused or not. <name/> was not the District *Vertinery> officer. He was the deputy. It was either doctor <name/> or Dr. <name/>.
Re-examination:
Accused was not the in charge of the *Vertinery> department. He was  a deputy MFI 3 referred to. The *imprest> was to go to Dr. <name/> for purchase of Vaccines (reads cut). MFI 5 speaks of district *Vertinery> officer Kitui.

No. 215968 IP <name/> CID Headquarters Nairobi. I am the investigating officer in this case. Sometimes in July 1992 I *accampnied> CIP <name/> to Kitui where we were to carry out investigations at Kitui *interfracted> Development Programme after an audit report had come to us from Price Water House we collected the questioned documents. They  were several questions where the Price Water House confirmed were not genuine. Among them were some for *Vertinery> Department. There were receipts used to surrender some *imprest>. There was an official Government receipt No. AM 778788 for 50,000/= marked MFI 2 3. I went to the DC's office to confirm but the receipts found there were the same number was for only 10/= MFI 4. It bares the same number as MFI 3. There was also a receipt from Dawa Phamacuticlas for  20,567/= MFI 5. I went to Dawa Phamacuticals and the questioned receipt book appears to have no such receipt because it was torn out. I took MFI 6 from Dawa Phamacuticals. I also went to Nairobi *Vertinery> centre where I checked for the receipt No. 5350 dated 1.10.91 MFI 12. When I checked I found it was only for 5.70/= according to their counterfoil book. I took a photocopy of the counterfoil book which I got certified as a true copy of duplicate MFI 3. Since the ones concerned with the receipt denied I preferred the present charges against them. I produce also the specimen as exhibits which I gave to the document examiner. I produce them as exhibits exhibit I to 13 produced. Accused pointed out.
Accused used to be a *Vertinery> doctor.
P. W. 12 cross-examined by counsel:
Exhibit 3 and 5 referred to. According to my investigations the vaccines were not purchased. 
Prosecutor close of prosecution case.
Counsel in submission:
Accused is charged with stealing by a person in employment.
Count I *marrates> the vaccines were not purchased. As per the charge sheet they were purchased and stolen. Count 2 is of stealing various items but all were not purchased and also count 3. The evidence does not terry with the particulars of the charge sheet. Accused is not charged of stealing the money. In as long as it inconsistent with the particulars of the charge sheet the accused knew to sell the same. I urge the court to award the accused the benefits of doubts and a caution in number section 210 CPC. 
Prosecutor In reply:
Exhibit 3 shows accused received an *imprest> of Kshs. 50,000/= as cash. Exhibit 5 shows the items were bought and received by the department so the question of the accused not to have taken the vaccines does not arise at all. The documents are all under evidence adduced by the prosecution warrants the accused to have a case to answer a case.
Ruling 
In the course of 1991 I was the deputy to the District *Vertinery> Officer Kitui. There was a Programme *Foward> the Kitui Integrated Development, Programme. The Programme was funding *Vaccination> of companies within our development. For that reason the District *Vertinery> Officer would take *imprest> to fund the project from the programme. As a deputy there were *instutes> where I would take the *imprest> on behalf of the department. Regarding the case in question I was not involved in the taking of the *imprest>, nor in the surrender but in the course of the route investigations I was called upon to give and examination as to how the Fund had been utilised. In the course of 1992 I was transferred to Mukueni District so while there investigations were going on I was not in Kitui any more I was in Makueni district. When I was called upon to give an explanation I did not know why my name featured at all except that on one of the documents used to surrender present somebody had put my name on. It was an official receipt from the Government, of Kenya. From the evidence adduced it was became credible at no time was I involved in the request for the *imprest> or the surrender, neither in the purchase of the items and at no time has it been adduced in court I came across the stores or take away the stores where they were kept in custody. The storeman revenue clerk all stood on the *dook> and said I never came to *intoucher> of the stores or that the store was broken and anything stolen. I have no idea why I am standing here but somebody scribed my name on one of the documents. I am innocent on all the counts.
Accused cross-examined by Prosecutor:
I was the deputy to the District *Vertinery> Officer. My work was involved deputising and handwriting duties ie vaccination. Yes, I used to get assistant from the programme of vaccines, transport and other facities. Before getting the assistant we make a formal request with a budgetary not on the request. The District *Vertinery> officer made the requests but in his absence I would make my request. On 27.8.91 I did not apply for an *imprest>., or vaccine worthy 50,000/=. The district *vertinery> officer may have applied. He was on duty. He was Dr. <name/>. Dawa Phamacuticuals is one of firms that supply drugs. We have dealt with them directly. I did not make an order with them then, I did have a secretary in my office one Stella Munenen. I could delegate writing of some documents to her. I could go through them before they are dispatched. Exhibit 2 refereed to. It does have my name as doctor <name/> for *imprest> 50,000/=. It is an *imprest> from me. It is not signed. It does have a signature of a programme director. Exhibit 3 referred to. It is number AM 778788. It bares my name. It is for 50,000/= *imprest>. I do not know how my name appeared on the two documents. Exhibit 4 before court. It bares the same receipt number as exhibit 3. This is for 50,000/= and the other for 10/=. When we got shortage of receipts we would not go for them from the DC's office. I do not remember any witness saying I applied for the said *impresent>. I deny applying for *imprest> and never for forged any receipt.
Re-examination: I never wrote exhibit 3 or even the name of it. I did not deal with the *reverant> documents at all. I never wrote  exhibit 4. My signature does not appear on exhibit 2. I did not fill the clearance form. I did not onion the 50,000/=. I did not buy the vaccines for my department.

We then arranged for an ambush at the place. I was with Sgt <name/>, Sgt <name/> P. C. <name/> and P. C. <name/>.
At 12.45 p.m. a vehicle KPB 954 which is a taxi, arrived carrying the suspects. We stopped the vehicle and it stopped. There were four men and one woman in the car. We searched them and I got a toy pistol from one of them. We then took them to Shaurimoyo police station for questioning. On questioning them they informed us that the other thugs were waiting for them in Mathare Valley. The woman suspect took us to Mathare Valley and pointed out a house where their companions were waiting. When we neared the house one man came out of the house running very fast. Sgt <name/> chased him and arrested him.
I Sgt <name/> and the woman suspect who was <name/> entered into the house in question. We found <name/> who is the man accused inside the house.
Accused was *conceating> himself behind the door holding a pistol in his hand. We ordered him to surrender the pistol and he threw it onto the bed. We checked the pistol and found it was .38 special No. A24753 which is this one (marked MFI 1) No. 247553 loaded with six bullets. If the crimes we committed early I still could charge you with that charge plus another one (wit shown the charge sheet).

P. W. 9 XTIAN MALE SWORN STATES:
My name is <name/>. I am a firearm examiner attached to Firearm *labatory> of CID Headquarters Nairobi. My duty includes examination of firearms and ammunition and identification of fired bullets and expanded cartridges. This is a full time occupation. I have 18 years experience. I received the following exhibits from P. C. <name/> on 12.3.90.
One fired bullet which is this one (MFI 5) which has been shown to me by prosecutor. I received from supt <name/> on 2.4.90 the following.
One Webbley and scot Revolver serial No. A 24753 which is this one MFI I) shown to me by prosecutor. I have examined the exhibit referred to above. 
MFI is a Webbley and scot revolver in 32 calibre. Serial number A 24753. This revolver is in good general and mechanical condition complete with all its components and capable of being fired. It is not prove to accidental discharge. I have successfully tested fired the same revolver by using three appropriate calibre round of ammunitions from our store.
The fired bullets were all recovered, marked and retained for purposes of comparisons. These are the three fired bullets marked (T stands for Test). (bullets marked MFI 6). I formed an opinion that MFI I is capable of being fired and that it is a firearm in terms of Firearm Act Cap 114.
MFI 5 is a fired bullet in calibre 7.65 mm and this is *eqquevalent> of .32 inches calibre automatic pistols. The said bullet is rather deformed. It would appear that the said bullet MFI 5 struck an object on impact and in the process it became so deformed.
The deformity on the same bullet has rendered some of the rifling markings unsuitable for comparative microscopic examination. I also found the same bullet was engraved with seven lands and groves which are the rifling of the burrow. 
This bullet was microscopically examined and compared with each of the fired bullets  (MFI 6). From the *compatives> made, I found sufficient watching rifling striations to convince me that the MFI I had been used to fire MFI 5. I used pistol ammunitions to test fire MFI I because the bullet MFI 5 the type used or loaded in pistol MFI 5 was not *approrpriate> for revolvers.
Summons to issue to executive officer R.M. <name/> to produce their criminal case file 2366/90 and chief magistrate execute officer to produce criminal case file 1 760/90, and 0/I Makongeni to produce him O.B. of 25.1.90

xx. by Mr. <name/> for 1st and 6th Accuseds:-
I would only initial these forms when I am on duty. I cannot tell if I was on duty these occasions. Yes, there was a time when a date stamp got broken but I cannot tell the period. It was fading progressively and I reported to our O.C. in writing. We continue using the good one as the bad ones cannot be used any longer. We add ink if it progressively fades and if it is bad  a><+_and> cannot work any longer, we stop using it. We have a diary, I do not know where such diaries are and I cannot know when a report was made as it was a long time.
I do not know the initials of workmates and I do not know the authors of these forms as they never passed through my hands. The forms are proper forms. Payment can only be made after the supervisor has initialled and I was not the only supervisor.

P.W.12 A MALE ADULTS SWORN AND STATES:-
My name is <name/>. I work currently at Enterprise post office as Postal superintendent, for 7 years since 1985. I have worked for 19 years. In 1989 to 1990 I was attached to City Square post office as Ag. Senior Postal superintendent. My duties were I was the in-charge of cash A/Cs. Section and used to reconcile cash A/Cs. for City Square post office. Once the daily transactions were balanced e.g. saving deposits and withdraws etc., A balance PI.65 booklet was compiled by the cashiers. It is called a counter balance book. In it is reflected the daily transactions and it has to balance. It was a busy place and I had a support staff. They balanced and I had to verify. Another prepared a summary and we had to compare the figures. I verified the counter balances and the documents were verified by another office to ensure that the summaries were correct. Ref: This is a counter-balance book, MFI-16 it was held at City Square post office from 14.8.89 to 6.12.89. The book was held by <name/> and I knew him, he is the 2nd accused. He worked as a counter clerk. He was solely responsible for entries in that book e.g. on 2.10.89 he dealt with money orders. The book is balance and I verified and transfer these figures to summary transactions, P.270. I mark in red that it is balanced and I have to verify that the cash was given to the cashier. The tickings in red are mine, I over looked signing at "checked by".
I did not sign although I checked due to pressure of work. Ref: MFI-17 book from 13.7.89 to 23.11.89. The book was for <name/>. Yes I knew her she worked as a counter clerk and she is the 6th accused. I checked this book and I did not initial due to pressure of work, though I checked it. Ref: MFI-18, it was held by our post office at City Square from 14.7.89 to 8.12.89. It was held by <name/> and <name/> from 13.9.89 and also <name/> &<name/> it is the 8th accused <name/> and he also worked as a counter-clerk. I checked it and it has my red marks. I did not sign it, I then transfer the information on P.270 form which had many columns for summary of daily duties and transactions. A 2nd person verifies the information and  its><+_it's> put on ACI 107 form. It is brought to me for comparison, they are further transferred to AC.102 which is a cash A/C. balance sheet if they do not balance, then it s brought to the notice of the officer concerned. The counter clerk also comes and certifies if there is an excess form P2 242 is completed and SI 23 a misc. A/C issued. In case of a shortage form P2 41 is completed and the shortage must be paid by the officer concerned. Once the A/C has balanced,  its><+_it's> taken to the head post master to check. We then dispatch it to our Divisional cash A/C. A/Cs and finance branch this book was held by many various people, due to several counter clerks taking over the same counter.
xx. by Mr. <name/> for 1st and 6th Accuseds:-
Ref: MFI-17, and there is no initial of mine put on it. Apart from what I am saying there is nothing in the book to suggest I dealt with it except for ticks in red pens. A red pen has a normal pen for superintendents checkings this book. In the red pen I wrote the final amounts and not the accounts officials concerned. I did not sign for alterations of amounts from what time counter clerk had written to what I got from the supporting documents. As a result of the alterations I am responsible. The supposing documents are checked by somebody else and I was using them at the summary. The summaries come to me and I verify. I check the automatics only, later on I get the supporting documents and if they talk the same figure, it is okay. I have not seen the supporting documents now for this book.
The P. 270 is for transactions on 2.10.89, I filled it but  its><+_it's> not here. It would tell us what the supporting documents talked about. For 1076 is a summary of savings transactions. It is brought to me to compare with my P. 270. I need all the documents to vouch for summaries in those books. 
xx. by Mr. <name/> for 2nd and 8th accuseds:-
On the morning of the next day is when I got the documents till noon. At noon the counter clerk comes and collects it i.e. the books - MFI-16,17, and 18. I was commenting for the counter-clerk to do what he had not done. I bring it to the notice of the counter-clerk and I expect a correction. MFI-18 at date 7.11.89, the cash and the stocks, they closed to work on 6th there and were handed over to another counter-clerk. This was made by the supervisor and not by me. They were handed over to the supervisor i.e. cash and stock for outgoing counter-clerk.
xx. by Mr. <name/> for 3rd and 7th accuseds:-
This book is important in the accounting system of the post office. That in the procedure, for the supervisor to write in red it is permissible. Supervisors also use red pens as they are postal superintendents. I was acting then. I take to him the summarised i.e. the final A/C.
I wrote the remark that I hope you are not covering any shortage by covering exceeding amounts. They were expected to keep 20/= as cash on hand and when I saw 120/= I made the comment, where the discrepancy does not exceed 5/= there is no much problem. Due to pressure of work I had not signed.
xx. by the 5th accused:- NIL.
xx. by the 9th accused:- NIL.
xx. by the 10th accused:- Nil.
Re-examination:-
I am not responsible for figures in red as I changed them when there are changes on the documents by other persons, other than me. It is procedural for the supervisor to write in red especially when the counter clerk is going on leave etc., and the supervisor remains with his cash in hand for handing it over to the in-coming counter clerk. The counter-clerk is only supposed to hold 20/= but I had seen 120/= and I made the comment for future reference. I regret the *ommission> of my signature due to pressure of work.

Yes I was the deputy but any accountant can endorse the cheques. It is not true that you avoided the other accountants because I was your friend cheques can be presented by the payee or in the company of the head of department. <._>or in the company of the head of departmentIII.
It is not possible to encash the cheques without the District  accountants><+_accountant's> authority normally the head of Department may come personally or call or send a note requesting assistance for his friend.
The authority is for the payee but the person who identified the payee is responsible in case the cheque bounces.
Yes in the instant cases the trade officer committed himself. There were many *others> cheques endorsed for some of the people would come with the cheques, others you would come personally, or call or send a note requesting assistance for his friend, The authority is for the payee but the person who identified the payee is responsible in case the cheque bounces.

My name is <name/> currently I work with D.C.'s office Isiolo. I am the acting District cashier, my duties amongst others is pay and receive government Revenue. I have been in Isiolo from 1981 *upto> now, I worked in the present capacity from 1988. My office is situated within the DC's office. I have known accused since he reported at the District as the District trade officer and was introduced to us. He was also the secretary of the joint trade board My office and his had a lot of transactions they were correcting *alot> of Revenues which would be brought to our office.
On 23.8.90 I was called to the CID office in relation to some cheques <_/>cheques which I had paid. The first one 136619 21.2.90 payable to <name/> Kshs.20,000/=.
The trader involved was brought to my office by Mr. <name/> who was the District trade office. He told me that the traders had been given a loan by the joint board but they had no bank accounts and so he was requesting that he be paid from the treasury. Having looked at the cheque I noticed that it had been endorsed by all the signatories, and at the bank the Deputy District Accountant had also endorsed it for cash payment so I asked the payee to produce his ID card but he did not have it, so Mr. <name/> Identified him as being known to him so having no doubt that Mr. <name/> as the District trade officer knew the trader well I paid the cash to the trade. <Name/> signed the cheque that the payee was known to him. The cheque was for 20,000/=. Cheque No. 136620 21.2.90 to <name/> Kshs. 20,000/= it was also brought by a trader who was introduced by Mr. <name/>, he wanted the cheque cashed. This trader also did not have his ID card. I asked Mr. <name/> whether he knew the trader and Mr. <name/> said yes and identified him and signed at the back of the cheque. I paid the cash to our trader. The cheque Is number 136620. Mr. <name/> was signing. In his capacity as the secretary of the joint loan board. So I had no doubts because he was the one dealing with these traders and I knew that he knew very well. 136620 dated 21.2.90.
In the name of <name/>. The cheque was brought by a trader whom I  didnt><+_didn't> know so after asking him for his ID he said he did not have it. So the trader went back to the District trade office and he came back with Mr. <name/> who identified him and signed at the back and put a Rubber stamp as well. And sure it had also been authorised to be encashed, by the accountant I paid it. I was familiar with <name/>'s handwriting and signature, so I paid one cheque. Cheque No. 136618 21.2.90. Payable to <name/> for Kshs. 20,000/= who also did not have the identification card, He came in the company of Mr. <name/> who also identified the payee to me, after this, I paid the Trader 20,000/=.
I paid the pension because there was an authorisation by the District Accountant and Mr. <name/> had identified the payee by signing and putting the official Rubber stamp.
Cheque 136615 name <name/> of 13.11.89. The payee did not come to my office in person. According to Mr. <name/> the payee had endorsed the cheque to be payable to the District trade Development office. So after the endorsement, Mr. <name/> had paid the payee from the Revenue collection of his office. So the cheque came into my possession as part of the District Development Revenues collection issued a receipt and a contra-cheque, for the Revenue collected by <name/>.
Cross examined by Accused:
Even by 1989 I was the acting District Cashier. 
My boss was <name/> the District Accountant. We normally encash pension and intentional cheques with authority. No cheque can be encashed without authority.
Payment can only be given on with authority of the DC, DOC, District Accountant or his assistant, by signing at the back of the cheque. A trade officer cannot give authority to cash the cheque.
His signature at the back is valid for identification. Your signature was valid because the pensions involved were traders. Socially I met you only a few times. I paid the traders without their ID cards because you identified them as being well known to you, because the cheques originated from your office and you *propossed> the cheques of this people. I had no reason to doubt you since you were a senior Government officer. You came with the traders to my office . The cheques had ID card numbers on the cheques but they did not produce the ID card. I did not ask you to sign twice and I cannot recollect whether you signed in my office or in the  accountants><+_accountant's> office. The fifth cheque was brought by yourself as part of your Revenue collections. This was not in order, but since it was authorised by the accountant I could not question him.
I know one <name/> a clinical officer in Isiolo but he is not the <name/> that you brought to me.
Re-examined by CP:
Yes I knew the accused very well and in the course of official duties Yes I was very familiar with his signature and handwriting, and he personally accompanied the payees and identified them.

He had presented it and requested that the <_/>the trader be paid cash. Mr. <name/> is that man (points) at the Accused). I asked him to endorse the cheque at the back and he did so. There is an ID No. on the cheque. At the time I was familiar with Mr. <name/>'s handwriting and I he must have endorsed it in my presence. I had no doubt since he was the one dealing with this particular account, so after endorsing I gave the cheque back to him. This cheque No. 136618 drawn on 21.2.90 the payee is Mr. <name/>. The amount is 20,000/= both words and figures, the cheque is authorised by the officers *capurating> that account. At the back I endorsed it for encashment. The cheque was presented to my by <name/> and he endorsed that the payee is know to me.
There is a signature and official rubber stamp for the District Trade Officer. The cheques were presented for payment at the bank. For me to endorse a cheque I have to know the payee or they must be known to some other officer. In the instant case they were known to the payees. On 23.8. 90 I gave my statement to the police. And that is the evidence I am now giving before this court.
Cross examined by Accused.
I went to Isiolo in 1987. I may not remember clearly whether I found you there or you found me there. I knew officially and as an individual. There were other accountants who could endorse, Cheques for cashing i.e. my deputies. Under special circumstances the DC or the DO could authorise. The DC was the overall boss and he would not have to call a meeting to inform us that he was authorising such payment. When I am authorising dealings with a departmental head I rely on him as long as I am satisfied that the cheque is properly drawn I *am> endorse it.
The cheque in question  were><+_was> properly drawn. I authorised the payment. You must have come to my office from the dates on the cheques it is possible that they were presented to me on the same dates.
I knew you as the person who had presented the cheques. I do not know <name/> on the cheque, that is why I asked you to identify him. Even if these people did not come with them I would endorse them since I was satisfied with you as someone known to me. I could have done the pace to any departmental near, you, signed the back in my presence. I do not know how the cashier paid. I do not know how the cashier paid the cheques. The cheques were properly drawn and you were one of the signatories so I could not suspect you of any foul play. It is possible that there are other cheques which I endorsed for you. The two cheques I have must have bounced at the first instance and honoured thereafter. I  dont><+_don't> recall whether the cheques came to me personally after they bounced.
They may have gone to *aother> officer. I had a deputy and assistant accountant and I had no reason to doubt them. It was *upto> the cashier how the payee identified himself at the point of actual payment. I had no reason to doubt you either I endorsed several cheques from other departmental heads.
