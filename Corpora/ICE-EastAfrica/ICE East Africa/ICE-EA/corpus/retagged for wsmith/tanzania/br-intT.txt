<$C> Face the Mike This is a weekly question and answer session on national and international issues Cotton is the world's leading textile fibre  counting><+_accounting> for about fifty per cent of the global textile market The annual consumption of cotton as a textile raw material is about sixty million bales the equivalent of fourteen million tons Tanzania is among the seventy-five countries which produce cotton in the world The large majority of world cotton producers are developing countries who have of late become consumers of their own raw cotton due to their rapidly expanding textile industries Yet as is the case with Tanzania cotton is one of the highly placed foreign exchange earners for developing countries Also according to official statistics cotton consumption in producer countries has more than tripled from two million tons between nineteen fifty and nineteen fifty-one to six million tons in the year nineteen seventy-four seventy-five Therefore most of textile industries of the developing world have home grown cotton available as raw material in abundant supply and at low cost However developing countries like Tanzania are facing a number of problems in their efforts to meet local and export needs of cotton The cotton industry in Tanzania has for many years been affected by such problems as failure to gin the crop and transportation but according to the general manager of the  Tanzania><+_Tanzanian> Cotton Authority <ea/>Ndugu Magnus Mdope a lot of effort is being made to improve ginneries and to eliminate other bottlenecks This is undoubtedly only part of the responsibilities of the Tanzania Cotton Authority which are elaborated further by <ea/>Ndugu Mdope in this week's Face the Mike interview with Radio Tanzania's <name/> Mahmood
<$B>  Tanzania><+_Tanzanian> Cotton Authority was established way back in nineteen seventy-three as a corporate authority charged with the responsibility of promoting cotton production in this country Actually its history emanates from the former <O/> marketing board which was charged with the responsibility of uh marketing cotton both internally and externally and in nineteen seventy-two with the decentralisation of the government machinery it was decided to form by this group authorities and as for cotton TCA was formed
<$A> uh Let's now uh come back to uh this week you call Cotton Week What is the significance of the week
<$B> Well the significance of this uh cotton week is uh that uh this year for the first time we'll be having an international conference on cotton uh in Arusha uh both the International Cotton Advisory Committee and the International Institute for Cotton will be having their plenary sessions in Tanzania and we thought uh it  could><+_would> be a good idea if we if the public had some idea of RRRof what RRRwhat these institutions uh are all about
<$A> uh Are there any other activities you're going to show in this week or you'll be only informing the public about the two international conferences in Arusha
<$B> Well we'll be talking mainly about those two uh international bodies and uh as usual the members of the public would like to know what's going on and we thought it  could><+_would> be a good idea if we could have uh a session whereby we could talk a little bit about cotton in Tanzania and internationally
<$A> What efforts are you putting to encourage cotton growers in the country 
<$B> Well that is a question which is being handled both by TCA in consultation with the government and as you know over the last couple of years production in Tanzania of cotton has stagnated around uh three hundred thousand bales whereas if you remember early in the sixties our production had gone up to almost half a million bales and what we've been trying to do is uh put emphasis on uh extension services by making sure that the farmers adhere to recommended practices of RRRof proper growing of cotton and uh other incentives which have been taken uh have been uh by way of increase in producer prices and increased efficiency in the processing and handling of the crop as a whole 
<$A> uh What is the main reason  of><+_for> the decrease of production 
<$B> Well one of the main reasons for the decrease in cotton production has been that uh you see most of this cotton in Tanzania is grown in the lake zone and uh there we have the problem of uh drought over a couple of years and uh this has had an adverse effect on the production of food crops Now cotton being an annual crop normally when the time comes for planting farmers tend to uh pay more attention to food crops than cotton and hence the decline in cotton production One other reason for this decline has been poor husbandry practices by the farmers
<$A> RRRMhm and crop authorities in the country uh have been engaged in marketing of the crop instead of uh establishing their own estates or farms uh how do you foresee this problem 
<$B> Well it could be that question could be true in respect to several other authorities but as far as uh cotton authority is concerned uh in fact since nineteen seventy-four we started opening our own estates and as of today we have about uh fifteen estates scattered all over the country mainly in the eastern cotton growing areas in Morogoro uh Kilosa and Tanga region Kilimanjaro and Arusha and also in the western cotton growing areas we have some farms in Singida Shinyanga <name/> and Mwanza region and Kagera So I wouldn't agree with your question that we haven't been uh addressing ourselves to that kind of problem 
<$A> That's very good and uh now <ea/>Ndugu Mdope sometimes textile industry in the country complains of shortage of raw materials while cotton is piled up in the regions' go-downs What is TCA doing to alleviate this situation 
<$B> Well that problem has occurred mainly I'd say this year It's RRRit's a very recent  phenomena><+_phenomenon> in the sense that in the past we used to have stocks to carry us through the season and this year because of the rehabilitation programme which is going on we had to stop our ginneries for maintenance some time in March and at that time we had stocks enough to last the local mills for about two months that's through to May and we thought uh given the fact that uh we would be having a new season by June we would have at least had uh enough cotton to keep them going starting from the new season Normally the mills are supposed to sort of close at least for a month uh to carry out some maintenance of their plants Now what happened uh particularly with respect to plants in Dar es Salaam uh French Textile Mill the their plants uh didn't tie with our plants and unfortunately it happened that they had to stop production some time in RRRin May but they resumed production immediately after a month and now things are more or less back to normal
<$A> You mentioned about the rehabilitation programme How far have you gone on that one 
<$B> Well the rehabilitation programme uh has been going on for the last two and a half years now and it's funded by the Dutch government in co-operation with our government It's supposed to come to an end uh by mid next year and the plan was to rehabilitate about four hundred gins in the Western cotton-growing area Up to now we've managed to rehabilitate about three hundred and two gins and we hope to complete the task by RRRby June
<$A> <ea/>Ndugu Mdope  on><+_in> May this year you held uh had BBByou heldRRR a workshop group  in><+_for> cotton growers in the country uh What  were><+_was> the purpose of that workshop and what came out of it 
<$B> Well the purpose of that workshop uh actually was to try and address ourselves to the problems uh affecting cotton production in this country given the fact that cotton is one of the major export commodities in Tanzania So we had uh various people from uh the party and the government from all cotton-growing regions assembled in Mwanza for a week and we discussed various problems which are affecting this production trend and one of the major issues which came out uh was that uh research seemed to be lagging behind uh production and extension also wasn't uh very well catered for and uh the government is now taking serious measures to try and rectify this situation
<$A> And how about uh the peasants who are growing cotton What incentives are you giving to them 
<$B> We try BBBwe tryRRR to make sure that uh one the price the producer price it's uh adequately covers their costs and that there that it leaves also a margin for them to keep going uh We also try and impress upon various authorities to make sure that uh consumer goods are made available to these villages where cotton is grown uh We have examples whereby distribution systems have been uh a little bit uh unfair to cotton farmers in the sense that for example they grow cotton and one of the things which we always try and hammer home during our campaigns is that cotton it's good for making cooking oil and uh uh uh textiles etcetera Now when the farmers produce this stuff and they don't get these commodities then uh it's RRRit's a little bit counterproductive What we're trying to do is uh try and impress upon the various authorities and make sure that these consumer goods are available to them and this RRRthis is sinking into people's minds and it looks as if we are on an upwards swing again
<$A> Yah and uh how about uh the competition in the world market How are we featuring 
<$B> Well  Tanzania><+_Tanzanian> cotton actually apparently happens to be one of those uh uh uh fibres which is IIIver IIIver very much in the mind and normally we have always fetched premium prices on the market because our cotton it's uh RRRit's hand-picked and roller-ginned which is uh an old  phenomena><+_phenomenon> Nowadays you know with mechanisation particularly in these big producing countries most of the uh harvesting and processing it's uh mechanised and you don't get the same quality type of cotton like you get from our country and uh in that respect we haven't had any problems in selling our cotton except only when uh the market has been flooded with just too much cotton as the case is the case this year then we find some uh uh downward trend uh in the pricing uh mechanism 
<$A> How are we ranking in the world market 
<$B> Well we are a very very small producer Mr Mahmood We produce hardly zero point five per cent of the total world production of cotton uh that Three hundred thousand bales is just about that kind of percentage 
<$A> Yah
<$B> Yah The biggest producers as you know are the United States Russia China India and all these other Latin American countries 
<$A> Yah <ea/>Ndugu Mdope uh the General Manager of Tanzania Cotton Authority uh I understand that uh you'll be hosting two international conferences in Arusha uh Let us start with the International Institute for Cotton Who are the members and uh what are the activities 
<$B> Well the International Institute for Cotton in its short form it's IIC is a promotion and technical research organisation which was founded in nineteen sixty-six and actually it emanates from uh the ICAC which we'll be talking about later and its membership comprises  of> uh apparently Tanzania uh India Mexico Spain Sudan United Arab Republic United States Uganda Ivory Coast and a recent member it's uh Zimbabwe and I think we have also Greece on the list
<$A> And uh what  are><+_is> the purpose of this meeting which is going be uh held in Arusha 
<$B> Well this is an annual meeting uh where various topics will be discussed uh and they all concern about major policy issues uh pertaining to cotton in various cotton-growing countries given the fact that uh cotton it's one of the major export commodities for seventy-five countries in the world 
<$A> uh Where  were><+_was> the last meeting held and what were the recommendations
<$B> The last meeting was held uh last year I think in August in Memphis in the United States and at that uh meeting they discussed the annual budget and uh technical research and developing programme for the nineteen eighty-three eighty-four year and in the coming session we are going to have a review of what has been going on during the last year and discuss the programmes for the coming year 
<$A> And uh besides uh holding the International Institute for Cotton uh you have the forty-third plenary meeting of the International Cotton Advisory Committee that is ICAC uh Would you mind to tell us uh a brief background about ICAC and uh what uh are you going to discuss in Arusha 
S1B042T
<$A> We present Face the Mike Face the Mike is a half hour session of questions and answers on national and international issues Facing the microphone this week is Mr Sebastian Kingo the Honorary Secretary of the newly-formed Materials Management Association of Tanzania Mr Kingo maybe we could start our session by first listening from you what made you to start such an association on materials management
<$B> Thank you very much uh Mr Mbunde for giving me this opportunity so that I can highlight some few items on Materials Management Association of Tanzania uh Materials Management Association of Tanzania has been formed uh officially registered on twelfth September nineteen ninety uh under the rules of uh societies and it has been recently inaugurated on thirtieth September ninety ninety-four with the patron being the Honourable Nalaila Kiula Minister for Works Communications and Transport
<$A> Mr Kingo what are the objectives of the association
<$B> First the main objectives of the Materials Management Association in Tanzania are mainly as follows uh First one is to encourage the exchange of ideas among materials management professionals and practitioners and promote the image and development of the profession Secondly it's to arrange for periodical meetings of members delivery of lectures reading of papers on subjects of professional or topical interest and to disseminate by any other means information considered to be of value to members and generally to promote the interests of members not forgetting uh to afford as a means of communication between the association other professional bodies and authorities
<$A> Mr Kingo your being the Honorary Secretary of the Material Management Association of Tanzania that's MMAT Having heard the objectives maybe our listeners now would like to know if you have any branches up country or in the regions
<$B> uh The association has just been recently uh inaugurated though it's since it's been registered since nineteen ninety Now after the official inauguration we are now trying to chart out the operations and of course we expect to operate throughout the country uh Right now we already have members uh We have about seventy-five members as at thirtieth September nineteen ninety-four and these they come from different uh parts of the country We have members for example from Tanga Sumbawanga uh and Mwanza now but our plan is that we are going to establish regional chapters as we go along
<$A> Well as you said that you are on your way to establish the regional chapters as you go along but maybe our listeners will also like to know uh who are the office bearers as up to thirtieth September nineteen ninety-four
<$B> uh Thank you very much Mr Mbunde uh During the annual the first annual general meeting which was uh held on thirtieth IIISep September nineteen ninety-four at the British Council Conference Hall the patron Honourable Nalaila Kiula the Minister for Works Communications and Transport remained the same while the following were elected in the governing council for the next four years We have Mr uh Edwin Mkisi who's a management consultant with SMW Management Consultants as Chairman then Ahmed Kilima the supplies manager of Tazara was elected as the Vice-Chairman and myself uh I was elected the honorary secretary Then we have a Mr Alfred Kinyundo a management  consultants><+_consultant> with CTMS was elected as Treasurer and the other six counsellors were who were elected that day were as follows Mbesa Malambugi She is a lecturer at IFM as a counsellor Odina Kalenga a senior supplies officer with TFMC a counsellor uh Veronica Mlowezi a senior supply officer with Tanzania Breweries She is a counsellor We have Thompson Kayuni a management consultant also as a counsellor IIIBenedic Benedict Semfukwe a supplies manager with Tanzania Breweries a counsellor and we have uh Mr O Msafiri the director of supplies and purchasing of Tanzania Harbours IIIAuthor Authority as a counsellor as well
<$A> Well Mr Kingo Sebastian people are now wondering that you have started this uh materials management association and there is the National Materials Board Does it mean that the Board is now phasing out to give way to your association Maybe now you will be in a good position at least to elaborate if there is any difference between Materials Management Association and the National Materials Board
<$B> uh Thank you very much Mr Mbunde uh This question is a common one we've been asked by several other people but we would like to elaborate that the National Board for Materials Management is there to stay and the uh Materials Management Association of Tanzania is also a different IIIass a RRRa different body Now the main difference is that the National Board for Materials Management is uh a government institution which has been formed through Act Number Nine of nineteen eighty-one while the Materials Management Association of Tanzania is a voluntary association of materials management professionals So RRRso much for the difference but we also have uh some common areas whereby uh we share interests Now as I have already mentioned one of the objectives of the association is to afford a means of communication between the association and other professional bodies and authorities In this case the MMAT will RRRwill provide a forum to materials management professionals so that they can come out and discuss issues of common interest with the National Board of Materials Management so that the development of materials management profession can be afforded Now of course uh uh one would also try to uh go further and say we as professionals in our association we would like to make use of our association as I said as a forum to communicate with different authorities including the Board itself For example we have come to notice that uh the profession itself the materials management profession in the country has not been so much publicised and we think this is one of the duties which could have been done by the Board Now let's say through common meetings with the Board we will discuss together and try to see how uh we can contribute promote the profession together
<$A> Mr Kingo an additional question there You have mentioned something which is very interesting maybe our listeners would like to know You know running of an association this causes a lot of problems and I wonder whether MMAT or Materials Management Association of Tanzania has ever been facing any problems since its inception in nineteen ninety as you said
<$B> Now thank you very much As we are we're we have recently experienced an inauguration and that means now we are ready uh to start our operations so that we can save our members and the public Now our RRRour main source of funds for financing our operations will mainly be through the uh entry fees of our members as well as annual subscription from our men But apart from that we uh expect to provide uh consultantcy services in future Now through these consultant services definitely we are going to charge fees which will be ploughed back in the association to keep the association running Now uh also since we are starting we RRRwe are going to of course approach uh the parent I mean the IIIMinis RRRthe Ministry of Works Communications and Transport uh since it is the ministry concerned with the development of this profession maybe to give us uh uh help especially during this uh start-up stage which we need some help so that uh later on we can uh finance ourselves
<$A> Well after having that very *elaborative> answer Mr Kingo now maybe it is high time uh We always know that among the questions that people have been asking on materials management in the developing countries such as Tanzania is how are you going to educate the people on the mission of your association to both your members and the public at large because as you have said that your association it's very new and not many people that are aware that it's working Now do you have any strategies that uh can make your association be known to the public so far
<$B> uh This is a very interesting question Now first of all I would like to say that it is very unfortunate that this profession has not delivered IIIha has not delivered the expected goods to the people and uh it is also uh very unfortunate that today we are almost marking more than ten years of the existence of the National Board of Materials Management in Tanzania Now we feel that uh in the association that this the profession of materials management uh is has been uh very much misunderstood For example uh we are we understand that our mission in fact is to try to help the users of our professional expertise to minimise the cost of their material inputs Since uh it is a professional fact that in the modern times the biggest cost factor in both production and service organisations is towards materials management and hence uh one would if RRRif one would like to follow up I mean through the financial statements of very of different organisations uh it can be seen that it is now almost more than sixty per cent of the budgets and to some extent if you take the construction uh industry it goes even up to eighty per cent of their budgets uh in one way or another used uh uh in relation to materials management uh aspects So the IIImisu I mean mismanagement of materials might mean uh a IIInon-atta attainment of of objectives of main organisations Our mission our professional mission in materials management is to help the user of our expertise to minimise the costs of input of material inputs Now uh this mission has not very well been understood and as a result up to now I'm sorry to say we are I mean the profession has not been used uh to our satisfaction and it also shows that most of our would-be users of our professional expertise they're still uh not happy with our services So one of our one of the first activities of RRRof RRRof Materials Management Association of Tanzania will be to try to create the awareness to the public that uh the profession of materials management can really solve part of their uh uh cost elements and we think without creating this awareness then it will be very difficult for us to be accepted As we know up to now our profession has been so much misused to the extent that the public and even the employers most of them have negative attitude to our people uh Negative attitude to our people in the sense that most of our people take us as you know there RRRthere is a common saying in the streets these are always I mean ten per cent people or RRRor things of that sort Now so after creating the awareness through publicity I mean using the different types of news media then we would embark ourselves into uh providing consultancy services to those who'll respond to our uh awareness creation So by doing this we think uh the public or the main users of our services who are mainly IIIemp IIIemp employers will understand us and they will need our services But all the same on the same line that the Board uh has been given a very powerful uh mandate by the act of parliament through Act Number Nine of nineteen ninety-one to control uh the the profession and the professionals themselves but uh we are most of the materials management professionals are really wondering what is happening after ten years of NBMM existence Still uh some especially the government institutions don't seem to care uh mostly in that in RRRin Act Number Nine of nineteen ninety-one there uh is part six which talks uh mainly on the effects of uh BBBeffects ofRRR registration and consequences of non-registration of materials management professionals Now this part has been uh As we say the Board has done a good job in training especially in training the materials management professionals but when it comes to monitoring what these people are supposed to do in the field uh we are sorry to say this has been the Board has registered almost total failure Now this is one of the aspects which we think we have to sit down and RRRand RRRand sit together and discuss with the National Board of Materials Management how uh we can work together so that the profession can help the public the way it's supposed to provide uh the professional services 
<$A> Mr Sebastian Kingo you being the Honorary Secretary of the MMAT or Materials Management Association of Tanzania you have been mentioning of professionalism in your association Maybe now you'll be in a good position at least to tell us what are the ethics of materials management professionals 
S1B043T
<$C> Face the Mike This is a weekly half-hour session on national and international issues in which this week we look at diabetes a non-communicable disease which is nevertheless affecting many people Interviewed are Doctor Duwari of the Tanzania Occupational Health Service and Doctor Ruisa of the Muhimbili Medical Centre They are being interviewed by Radio Tanzania's <name/> UUUNesekeli on their diabetic camp organised by the Lions Club of Dar es Salaam city on Sunday twenty-eighth October nineteen ninety-four
<$A> First we should like to know uh what are the objectives of the camp which will be organised on Sunday the twenty-eighth of October nineteen ninety-four 
<$B> The aim of the camp is to screen the general mass by medical check-up by doing urine and blood sugar examination for detecting new cases <O/> examination of diabetic patients and assist them by providing the detailed information for their problems 
<$A> Yah You referred to the general audience Doctor Duwari you mean  that's><+_that> everybody's invited uh to the camp
<$B> Everyone is invited  in><+_to> the camp so that uh this will help the general mass and this will help us also for detecting the new cases 
<$A> And what prompted you to organise the camp specifically in Dar es Salaam You mean it's a RRRa place with uh many cases of diabetes or something related to that 
<$B> No it is not like that Actually last time we have organised this camp and that was one of the most successful  camp><+_camps> We have tried to organise a camp in Lindi and Mwanza but uh due to the lack of UUUchemical and some problems we could not organise the camp last year but this year we are planning to organise it in the up-countries The prevalence of diabetes  have><+_has> got no concern with the RRRthe township 
<$A> Yah What can you tell us about the arrangements so far How many doctors are we expecting in the camp this year 
<$B> There are a team of twenty-five doctors and uh there are BBBthere areRRR specialists of different fields They will be also staying in the camp 
<$A> Yeah Can you mention the specific RRRspecific fields because what uh a common man like myself <./<underst understands is that uh each uh of the doctors will be connected with IIIdiabet diabetes or something related to that 
<$B> I'll give you a general outline of the camp but all the general masses who so will come in the camp they will be passed through the screening by the general medical check-up then urine and blood examination for sugar Those  patient><+_patients> who are detected as diabetes as diabetic  patient><+_patients> and the known diabetic cases they will be sent to the consultant chambers The consultants are there for the medical specialities consultant surgeon consultant gynaecologist paediatrician dietician optomologist and in this way it means I can say all the consultant facilities are there and after the camp we will be providing them if uh we get the medicine the medicine will be provided to them free as well as one of the  book><+_books> which gives a detailed information for the diabetes that will be provided free 
<$A> uh Thank you Doctor Duwari uh but we would like to know generally what is diabetes 
<$B> Actually diabetes I can say as everyone knows that a motor car needs  a> petrol to give energy to travel along the road in the same way our body needs food which gives energy to work and play After eating they start containing food They are broken down into sugar in the digestive system Then it passes from gut to blood It's carried to different parts of body to give energy In the  abdominant><+_abdominal> cavity of our body we are having an organ called  as> pancreas which produces a substance known as insulin This insulin in the people who do not have diabetes is produced by the pancreas to help sugar to get inside the tissue and to keep the blood sugar level at normal level but the person with diabetes has pancreas which is unable to produce insulin to unable blood sugar to be used as fuel and to keep blood sugar normal so the blood sugar rises to high level This is known as diabetes 
<$A> I see it's a complicated system Doctor Duwari uh but uh one would wonder uh because you have mentioned that uh within the system what is uh involved is food uh You mean it's uh food which contains sugar or any type of food which can lead to such complications 
<$B> No actually you can say that mostly the starch food are excess of sugar containing food 
<$A> Yah and uh what is actually the source of this failure of the pancreas to perform their duty 
<$B> Actually the cause of this is not yet known 
<$A> It can be as a result of some other side effects maybe 
<$B> No this can be a secondary cause 
<$A> So it means when we would like to dwell critically on what are the causes of diabetes uh what can we find actually Doctor Duwari
<$B> Actually the causes of diabetes we do not know exactly what are the causes of diabetes There are number of different causes which are not yet fully understood but obesity should be avoided in the diabetes 
<$A> uh You have so far mentioned that there are so many cause of diabetes but most RRRmost of them are not yet understood Do you mean whose task is it for uh Is it the task of doctors to carry out IIIres researches on these causes or how can you BBBcan youRRR put it 
<$B> There are a lot of researches going on diabetes but uh no-one has yet established one cause that this is the only reason for  the> diabetes 
<$A> uh Let's cite the case of Tanzania are we having any research which is conducted on diabetes 
<$B> Yes in Tanzania we are having a Tanzania Diabetic Association and uh it is the chairman of the Tanzanian Diabetic Association is Professor <name/> and he is doing the research on  the> diabetes 
<$A> And what has been the recent findings of their research 
<$B> That I think uh Doctor Ruisa can tell you because he is working with uh Doctor <name/> 
<$C> Well maybe what I can say about the findings although they are not completely <O/> it would seem that we're beginning to get more and more cases of diabetes Now I'm not saying that it's increasing That could mean BBBthat could meanRRR only that we are now patients are now coming they are turning up for treatment when they not used to do that in the past So it's not The results are not yet out but I can say we RRRwe are IIIse BBBwe areRRR seeing quite a number of patients turning up and as I said maybe it's because they are getting aware of their problems 
<$A> Yah and is it easy for a person to just RRRto trace himself that he's having that disease 
<$C> Yes there are some certain  sign><+_signs> and symptoms of the disease so Like uh I can tell you the most common sign and symptoms like frequent urination excessive drinking of water weight loss weakness and irritability frequent infection of his skin and gums blurring of vision slow healing of wounds If someone is having such  type><+_types> of problem that person the person should go and approach the doctor and get himself thoroughly investigated for diabetes and Tanzanian Diabetic Association is providing all these facilities They are free of cost to the patients 
<$A> Yah how long does it take for one to discover that he has contacted such a disease as diabetes Is it so sooner like wound say 
<$C> No as soon as he notices this problem if he approaches a clinic it takes hardly I can say if we investigate him thoroughly it is a matter of half an hour 
<$B> Maybe I could add it's a bit tricky you know Sometimes the patient can come with wounds He's been having wounds on the back on the buttocks for about a whole year maybe a few years maybe years then only we are looking after the BBBafter theRRR RRRthe RRRthe abscesses we find out that he's actually diabetic so it can be as well that On the other hand it can be so sudden that your patient becomes unconscious he just got unconscious because of diabetes and you find that it's because of diabetes and he says that I was previously well maybe last the two weeks except that I was feeling a bit thirsty so it's quite variable I can't say there's a RRRa fixed term you can put on it 
<$A> Now and is it infectious 
<$C> No it is not infectious It's just if you have that disease you stay with it you are not going to submit it to another person not even to your to your wife or anything it's not infectious 
<$A> I see and suppose I'm RRRI'm having the disease I'm suffering from disease I mean uh can my uh my RRRmy son or my daughter suffer all the same from the BBBfrom theRRR disease 
<$C> That that's comes from what Doctor Duwari has just mentioned in that there may actually be some genetic uh RRRgenetic element It can be inherited In some cases it RRRit runs in family It's not BBBit's notRRR a very strong one as you'd say uh the father was dark skin the son will be dark skin but quite a weak association but there is a  tendence><+_tendency> for this disease to run in families and if there is an inheritable element therefore so that one of the children might have it from the grandfather or the father 
<$A> Yeah one also wonders how diabetes can be cured Doctor Ruisa
<$C> Now this there's no cure for diabetes I think that's uh unfortunate to say there's no BBBthere's noRRR cure for diabetes as such and uh except what I can say is sometimes in the early stages when you get the disease there RRRthere may be a period which we call the honeymoon You see someone comes diabetes is discovered for the first time and then after about a few months he seems to be you know BBBto be<_/> getting better In fact he may get off all the drugs and he says I'm cured but we call this RRRthis a honeymoon and we are sure in a few BBBin a fewRRR months it will come up and he becomes a diabetic permanently and we are not going to be able to cure this and this maybe might explain why that's what I think because there are some people who say they can cure diabetes actually even our traditional healers Now I I've been wondering whether this is not the honeymoon they are calling a cure I don't know RRRdon't quite *known> that but that's my fear about these RRRthese claims
<$A> uh I'm worried Doctor Ruisa because we are talking in view of the camp which will be conducted on Sunday the twenty-eighth of IIIOcto RRR of October nineteen ninety-four uh What makes me fear is that maybe uh because you've said that there is no cure as such for diabetes then people'll just consider the camp as useless 
<$C> No that's RRRthat's not true uh It's RRRit's even if you cannot cure you can control For instance if you got someone with a broken arm now if you RRRyou can produce you can make a hook and he can use that one a whole year and RRRand do other functions For instance uh uh Doctor Duwari has said the pancreas is diseased it's not working but through RRRthrough this intensive research which has been going on we know it is insulin which is not effective which is not BBBwhich is notRRR present or it's not enough of quantities and through the same research we have it now insulin is available so maybe if you bottle it put in bottles the patient can use it by uh by RRRby RRRby injecting himself or RRRor if I could just speak about the treatment of diabetes as such 
<$A> RRRMhm
<$C> There are actually three approaches to this problem One of them is by diet the other one is you can use tablets uh to control uh the problem and the other one is you can use insulin as RRRas an injection as an injectable form Now for diet the aim with diet is to keep the person  in><+_at> a good weight to maintain a normal weight There are BBBthere areRRR charts which show for the given height RRRheight and age this patient should have a certain weight 
S1B044T
<$A> In today's programme of You and the Environment we have Mr William UUUKijoti of the Capital Development Authority CDA of the Dodoma <O/> who is the chief environment management officer Today we'll discuss on the issue of afforestation and other environment protection projects What are the responsibilities of your department under the auspices of CDA as the organ solely responsible for the development of this town
<$B> Uh the responsibility of my department is to make the city green by planting trees and ornamentals for purposes of erosion control visual enhancement recreation and eventually timber supply 
<$A> Uh I mean those uh those  seems><+_seem> to be much more of afforestation rather than protection environment Don't you have other projects to RRRto enhance protection of environment
<$B> There are also other projects such as those of erosion control pollution control and advisory RRRadvisory services to people within the city on management of their environment
<$A> Now how was the situation of the Dodoma town before you started the afforestation projects
<$B> Before we started this project the town was bare dusty with the occasions of floods during the rainy season 
<$A> Uh and is it does it mean that those problems were mainly associated with the deforestation 
<$B> Sure Due to lack of trees or vegetation in general uh the city was experiencing a lot of uh strong winds carrying a lot of dust and during the rains a lot of soil was being carried from the hills into the city and so also too a lot of water we ended up with floods
<$A> Now how many projects have you undergone since then 
<$B> RRRTo date we have fourteen projects plus our forest projects and eight village projects 
<$A> I've learned that your target is to make sure that Dodoma town is changing from its semi-arid environment to a green belt Now how much successful have you been as far as that is concerned 
<$B> So far we've planted four thousand hectares and we've managed to conserve nine thousand hectares of forest That's natural forest Therefore we've a total of thirteen thousand hectares of forest developed Also in villages we've succeeded to establish trial plots or rather demonstration plots in eight villages and school woodlots in all these villages 
<$A> Yeah but you've talked of the conserved forest What do you mean by conserved forest and planting trees Does it mean that they are two different things 
<$B> Sure When we have an area which is completely open I mean without any vegetation we have to plant so that we can establish a forest When an area has a IIIpoten RRRa potentiality of uh being protected up to years to become a forest by its own we call it a conservation project or rather conservation forest 
<$A> I see Now what has been the people's response towards the whole plan 
<$B> At the beginning the response was negative in a lot of cases because people thought we were just trying to snatch land from their hands for no reason but later or gradually they started accepting but of course up to now it's not a hundred per cent because people need land for grazing and other uses so also due to lack of knowledge they don't realise the fact that also trees and other  vegetations><+_kinds of vegetation> are important in their environments 
<$A> Now if that is IIIth BBBif that isRRR the case uh what do you do to make sure that those people do understand 
<$B> We this is why we have an extension service whereby we visit villages and educate them on the environment and uh actually this has been quite effective 
<$A> Okay What problems have you been facing 
<$B> Our main problems have been financial and lack of people's participation 
<$A> Now what do
<$B> That means we've had limited funds to carry out the jobs and we've had little participation from people 
<$A> When you say you have little participation from the people and on the other BBBon the otherRRR hand you said you've got what you call community forests where you RRRyou incorporate people how does it I mean how RRRhow is it possible 
<$B> We have projects where we try to utilise people's efforts but so far people have not co-operated so much What I mean is of course some people have appreciated but we still have a big number of villagers who don't appreciate the project and this is why I'm saying we still have a lot of work to do on extension services to ensure that people appreciate the importance of planting trees or rather protecting their own environment 
<$A> In some places when we have people who do not accept such projects we find the problems uh such as that the people would RRRwould set into fire the whole place let's say the whole conserved place or the whole IIIplan uh trees which were planted how about Dodoma 
<$B> That is also the case When people didn't like a project they tried to discourage it and that's why they tried to set fires and so forth but at least my experience is that this problem has gone down very much 
<$A> We all understand that environment protection and conservation is the world cry in our time and is the theme of everyone concerned every concerned people now what other projects are you involved in to match  with> that 
<$B> Other projects include purely erosion control on areas which are very much exposed to the problem and we cut up the job by say construction of check-dams planting of grass and other  vegetations><+_kinds of vegetation> which can survive in areas which have been very much destroyed Also we have pollution control programmes This is where we involve industrialists in ways that they can control uh their  dispose><+_disposal> of residues from their industries and so forth also advisory services to villagers on how to protect their own environment is another project That makes about three programmes in addition to tree planting
<$A> In other cities such as Mwanza for example we've got the problem of those industrialists having no plans of uh RRRof disposing their residues and leftovers from their industries and that  bring><+_brings> us to the problem that they're disposing their waste materials  to><+_in> the lake for example Lake RRRLake Victoria Now have you any specific plan or let's say specific area where you have instructed those industrialists to RRRto dispose their waste
<$B> Sure For example for liquids we have the main sewer here in this town We have constructed a sewer which will BBBwhich willRRR transport all chemical residues all liquid IIIresid residues to uh an extension point outside the city For  solidy><+_solid> residues we have set aside areas where those can be dumped into pits and then covered so that they don't cause much harm to residents of the city 
<$A> Some of the problems in other big cities is that they lack proper plans for the development of their cities now and that has caused a lot of problems as far as protection of environment is concerned Now how have you go about that 
<$B> For us this city is very well planned We actually have a master plan Everything has got its own location and it has to be located there Therefore chances of making mistakes are very few For example very few cities have got this green belt project or rather uh even not only the green belt but even this *dispose> of uh residues from industries We find that most of the cities have not got this planned in advance but for us all these have been planned and implementation is according to the plan so there are no dangers or chances that we'll have such problems
<$A> Well as far as your explanation is that you have other projects IIIin incorporated in the environment protection and we have mentioned some few now what is your success story of uh those projects 
<$B> As far as protection of the environment is concerned I can say there is a lot of success because if one had  a><+_the> chance to come to Dodoma some ten or thirteen years ago the situation was really poor It was as I said plenty of dust in the city and so forth but right now the city is green especially for those areas which are planned and the belt has come up very nicely Of course we had problems but I can say it's quite a good success in general 
<$A> By the way who  finance><+_finances> these projects 
<$B> This project is mainly financed by the government but also we have had assistance from several organisations like UNDP WFP <name/> and <name/>
<$A> Now what is your general view  over><+_of> RRRover the whole issue 
<$B> My view is that uh the issue of environment is very delicate The environment is very difficult and expensive to handle but if not protected we have no future It requires everyone's participation and a great effort to ensure further protection People have to understand their environment and sort out better ways of exploiting it without destruction 
<$A> Well and that brings me back to the RRRto RRRto my worries When you've talked of the conserved forests it means that before the those forests were conserved those forests were catering for the people the people's needs as far as  woods><+_wood> for cooking let's say is concerned or charcoal-making and these BBBand theseRRR sort of things Now what alternatives do you give those people instead of
<$B> Actually that is why I said we were convinced that it was important to have village forest projects so that we could assist people in planting their own trees so that they can get their own needs from their own land and if you plant trees and take care of them you can use much less land to get enough of the requirements and also it's not only of course you are right it's not only that they were not uh I mean they were using the forest for RRRfor wood products but also for grazing and so forth So we are also advising them to plant grass and tree species which can be used for as fodder and if you plant your own fodder you use much land IIIal less land also So even when we've taken so much land for forest people can still get their requirements if they use their remaining pieces of land with wood plants 
<$A> We have learned in this city that there are those problems of uh soil destruction in the sense that people are  dugging><+_digging> out soil and some are doing that destruction on those planned areas for RRRfor residential use Now what do you do to RRRto combat that situation 
<$B> There are several ways of combating the problem One is by using a bit of force to ensure that people don't get into such areas and the force is exerted by the capital <O/> authority but also the villages have been assisted and they have been encouraged to try as much as possible not to allow people to get into areas which are not set aside for IIIexca excavation of sand or UUUmarm etcetera Also we've set aside areas in which we've shown people areas where they can get their requirements and those areas do not pose any danger to our environment 
<$A> Does it Is it that those sand excavators are individuals or they're grouped into companies or other groups 
<$B> It's everything individuals companies All of them want to construct They want to build houses roads and so forth So they are all involved in the destruction of the environment
<$A> Now in forest conservation what is mainly involved 
<$B> In forest conservation the main the first thing is to get into an area and make a vegetation survey The vegetation survey is aimed at ensuring that the area has got desirable species If the number of desirable species is high enough to convince a forester that the area thus requires protection then it is conserved Now by desirable species I mean tree species which are desired regardless of their age valuable tree species in terms of either recreation timber or erosion control or even fodder After ensuring that uh we've a reasonable number of IIIde desirable trees in the area then we declare it a conservation forest and the area is completely protected no grazing no harvesting no fires and any other types of destruction in the forest

<$A> In this edition Leila UUUSchechashem talks about the Tanzanian Media Woman Association Crisis Centre running every Friday at Magomeni in Dar es Salaam 
<$B> The Centre has been operating for the past two years uh We decided that it is uh important to have such a centre and the first of its kind in the country whereby we give uh legal advice we give counselling to victims of domestic and sexual violence The centre uh opens every day Monday till Friday Initially we used to open on Friday afternoons and then the demand became greater and we decided to open on Monday Wednesday and Friday but now we open from Monday till Friday There is always a counsellor and a lawyer available at the Centre But uh apart from uh offering legal uh RRRlegal advice and counselling to victims of domestic and sexual violence we also give literature on how to avoid such uh violence for to women and children For example we have an outreach programme where we go to school and institutions of learning we visit factories and other places of work We give lectures on uh the issue of violence against women and children and we also distribute a lot of literature and we feel that uh with the increased awareness among the public on the very issue of violence that is one way of RRRof containing the problem
<$A> For the first two years that you have been operational what would you say are the key problems that women come up with 
<$B> Uh you see initially when we started we were quite uh uh discouraged in the sense that uh most of the cases that we got dealt with inheritance custody and maintenance and we felt that we should not turn them away because that is a form of a problem although primarily the Centre was established to help victims of domestic and sexual violence We felt that okay whoever comes along we're going to help them That also included victims of drug abuse That uh RRRthat also included uh victims of AIDS we offered them counselling and advice But after a lot of publicity and I have to say here that Radio Tanzania played a very big role in helping us to publicise the Centre's work we got uh cases of domestic violence and sexual harassment and sexual abuse started trickling in and uh because of this raised public awareness that women should not feel ashamed that children should not be made to feel ashamed when such cases happen that they should come forward to get uh medical treatment and to get uh uh counselling and also rehabilitation and to press charges against the assailant Somehow slowly RRRslowly the cases started trickling in and in the past year we have been getting a lot more cases dealing IIIexcluse exclusively with domestic and sexual violence And uh you see uh we have uh because the Centre is the first of its kind in the country really we were sort of groping in the dark because we didn't have a blue-print whereby we could operate such a centre but uh we had a lot of literature from other centres in the world for example in Zimbabwe our sisters there are quite advanced in RRRin counselling victims of domestic violence and also in RRRin Western Europe in America and in Asia especially South East Asia We got a lot of literature from them We wrote to them letters asking them if they could send us their experiences on how to operate such a centre and from that we learned from them and we decided to adapt some of those uh IIIex experiences to our own environment And uh as I said before we were groping in the dark initially but now in the since we started two years ago up to now we have sort of we are beginning to stand on our feet we are becoming more confident and uh we are more able to RRRto offer help because now we sort of have devised a strategy and RRRand it's quite uh BBBit's quiteRRR effective 
<$A> You told me earlier on that uh you have employed a multi-disciplinary approach to you know dealing with the cases at the Crisis Centre How do you operate 
<$B> We have uh counsellors uh from various uh fields You see we have experts For example we have lawyers We have social workers We have teachers We have journalists We have even  housewife><+_housewives> We have religious organisations different churches and so on uh and all of us have something to offer the Centre All of us have uh experiences uh All of us have a form of expertise that can help in mobilising the RRRthe RRRthe public And uh each one of us contributes something For example you and I are journalists we both we're both uh counsellors in the Centre and our help has been in giving information in uh RRRin designing in editing in RRRin putting down putting up the pamphlets that are part of the literature in the programme The others the social workers for example they give counselling and rehabilitation The lawyers give legal advice The doctors come in they RRRthey help us with medical advice and so on So each one of us contributes something and uh uh what uh RRRwhat uh RRRwhat has uh come up is that uh we have evolved this kind of team spirit you see among ourselves For example I co-ordinate the Centre but uh I'm not really a boss in the sense that I don't sort of give orders like uh this is what RRRwhat should be done We always have good meetings We have a kind of group therapy which helps us a lot because counselling is very hard work Counselling requires a lot of concentration if We have to give up a lot of ourselves in counselling Sometimes our tempers become frayed Sometimes we RRRwe become nervous so we decided that we have to have a group work therapy and we decided that it is important to have a group therapy every month or at least every six weeks where we counsel ourselves and we RRRwe learn from each other and also to let off steam That helps a lot 
<$A> Someone might wonder where you get the time to do this kind of thing Because I think the majority of you have your own salaried jobs  isn't it><+_don't you>
<$B> Yes uh we all have uh we're all employed elsewhere For example I RRRI edit a magazine I also do edit books There are some of us who work in RRRin newspapers Some of us work in the UUUTanzananical Corporation Some of us work in different places teachers and so on Uh You see counselling is not a paying job because it RRRit doesn't pay in terms of uh monetary value You RRRyou don't get IIIan you don't get much out of it If anything the stipend that one gets just barely covers the RRRthe transport to and from the Centre But we get BBBwe getRRR a lot of satisfaction we get a lot of uh uh a feeling of achievement from having RRRhaving helped people and also it helps us in the process because when we counsel BBBwe counselRRR the RRRthe RRRthe clients who come there in the process we also exercise our own fears we also exercise our own nervousness our own inadequacies and it helps us a lot that way So as I said uh counselling pays emotionally it pays morally but not in RRRin monetary form no it doesn't 
<$A> And in terms of uh uh maybe success stories Would you be in a position perhaps to pinpoint one case or two that you thought was really outstanding in which uh the Crisis Centre emerged successful
<$B> Yes uh there are two kinds of successes here that I RRRI think I should say that The first kind is where a woman whose uh RRRwhose husband was battering her and uh he was battering her all the time and she came to see us and we asked us we asked her whether she wanted to press charges in court whether she wanted to sue for compensation or whether she wanted a divorce and she said no that she was still in love with her husband and we felt that okay this marriage can be salvaged We RRRwe RRRwe can offer counselling to the husband as well because batterers are also victims in their own way We called the husband forward and he came thank God he came there and we counselled him and we RRRwe went back to the root cause of the problem and we discovered that his mother was also battered by his father and he thought that this is a way of life this is how husbands live with their wives and we tried to tell him that this is not how people live and slowly over RRRover a period of time he came to accept that battering is bad and he was ready to reform So we felt that they had to come for IIIcounsel RRRfor more counselling in the Centre but I think their marriage survived and I think they're quite happy now That is one success story The other success story is success in a perverse way because this girl got raped So I mean when you talk about success you can't say that this is a happy story It's a sad story but success in the sense that we got the RRRthe assailant the perpetrator of the crime to be imprisoned for seventeen years and thirty lashings and also to pay compensation to the girl But that was not success for us as much as when the girl because initially she was quite scared to go out on her own to go BBBto goRRR on public transport because she felt that this could happen again you see the RRRthe abuse We counselled her and over a period of time she could come from her home in the district to the Centre on her own without uh somebody accompanying her But later on what made us very happy was the fact that she decided to go for further studies away from Dar es Salaam where she can go  in><+_to> a teacher training college And I think uh that is success in a way
<$A> Would you say Leila such cases of rape uh are rampant say in Dar es Salaam or in the country general
<$B> You see uh rape doesn't have a particular face or a sexual harasser or a rapist doesn't have a particular face like he has a horn on his head or he has uh he's RRRhe's got blue skin or No any RRRany good-looking smart intelligent educated man can be a rapist and those men who are sort of low income group dirty or IIIthe they probably respect women and they take care of women and they know that rape is bad so he it doesn't have a blue-print like you can tell your children or you can tell your sisters don't RRRdon't RRRdon't talk to such a person because he RRRhe could he is a rapist No he doesn't have a face What we discovered in our research and also from our work in the Centre is that uh RRRthat some girls or some women got raped by neighbours people they trusted or even by brother-in-law or by RRRby an uncle people they trusted people that their parents would entrust them with Or you find that you'll find a stranger somebody who's far away from the family somebody you don't know probably he will come forward and help you So a rapist doesn't have a particular face What we what I always try to tell young girls and also women is to say that try not to walk in dark places try not to stay in the house on your own with a stranger or even if you feel that a person is becoming uh offensive put up a struggle or shout or get away from the house And also to small children we always tell them that uh you know like we have in our African society we're told that you have to respect your elders Whatever they tell you to do you have to do like you can send somebody somebody's child to the shop send somebody's child to the market It's accepted Sometimes we keep telling the parents that you be careful Tell your children to RRRto respect elders but at the same time not to be too trusting So quite often we find that those children who have been abused it's by people they know

<$A> We are here once more with yet another new edition of the programme Be My Guest This is a programme that invites a guest into the studio to tell us more about himself what he does and other aspects relating to life generally Well our guest today is Doctor Said Hussein Kapiga from the Muhimbili University College of Health Sciences here in Dar es Salaam Doctor Kapiga you are our guest today welcome to our programme and indeed to Radio Tanzania
<$B> Thank you
<$A> Dr Kapiga you are a medical doctor at the University College of Health Sciences Muhimbili Dar es Salaam Maybe to begin with can you tell us a little bit more about yourself and the type of work that you do
<$B> Thank you Mr Tesha I am I lecture in the Department of Epidimiology at uh Muhimbili University College uh I'm teaching epidimiology which is mainly a study of uh methods and uh uh approaches which are used in investigation of diseases identification of risk factors and uh general principles of disease uh control
<$A> That is in as far as the type of work you are doing is concerned but how about yourself
<$B> Uh myself uh I am I started working at Muhimbili in nineteen eighty-seven and uh you know apart from my teaching I'm also working with the Ministry of Health uh in several activities related to family planning uh and you know mainly research but also dissemination of research findings
<$A> How did it come that you became interested in this particular field of work 
<$B> Uh well my interest dates back to the medical school days yah you know I became in general interested in reproductive health and family planning is obviously one of the key reproductive health issues and obviously uh you know having gone through the courses seeing the population problems and the role which family planning could play uh I became interested to work in this field
<$A> Dr Kapiga you are saying you are uh doing something relating to family planning services here in Tanzania What does this specifically entail
<$B> Uh there are several things I have done but probably the RRRthe most relevant for RRRfor this purpose is that uh the Ministry of Health and uh the Bureau of Statistics and uh the planning uh the population planning unit within the planning commission and Muhimbili Medical Centre they developed a sort of a presentation which uh shows uh population problems in the country and also it shows uh you know family planning use and some of the problems which are associated with uh particularly low family planning use and uh the idea is we are trying to generate uh uh we are using information generated in Tanzania to try to sensitise especially people as policy makers and the other people who may facilitate uh uh who may give a helping hand in trying to raise uh family planning use uh in Tanzania
<$A> For RRRfor how long has uh this particular project been in existence and uh would you say you are making any success at all 
<$B> uh this project uh is supported by RAPID project which is uh based in uh North Carolina and the US and uh receives funds from US-AID and it started last year What was done was to put together information from different sources from different research findings and uh making sense out of this uh information Most information as you know generated from research is you know presented in scientific fora and is not really uh in usable form for policy makers and other people So this attempt tries to bring this information in a much easier way uh which can be understood by people at policy level and hopefully we'll generate their interest and their participation in uh IIIr raising awareness and also promoting uh use of family planning methods We have started the presentations about two months ago uh although we have been less successful in uh making many presentations because uh you know we are not uh getting uh many information about meetings which are happening So far we have made a presentation to the Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Health uh We also made a presentation to the uh uh Association of Statisticians the Bureau of Statistics and uh there are several planned sort of dissemination uh meetings which are planned in the near future
<$A> Well if you travel across Tanzania you will come a number you will come across a number of uh areas large areas that are uninhabited and this is the situation in quite a number of the other developing countries Now if this is the case if that is the case why should uh uh your project uh concentrate on uh this issue of family planning in a place like Tanzania when we know that we have areas which are large areas which are uninhabited
<$B> Yes that's a good question uh uh I think it's not the question of land uh that here you have land which is uninhabited uh I think it's more or less the issue of you know balance between resources and people you have uh Obviously we have a vast land but when you look in terms of actual resources which are available obviously uh you know we have a serious stress in our you know economic capability to support this large sort of population so that is one aspect uh you know serious threat in the population and gross imbalance uh between uh what the economy can support and what uh numbers you have in terms of people But there are also other uh health uh rationale for family planning uh you know high births uh you know many births which are not spaced are known to pose a high risk uh health condition among both the mother the family and also the babies who are born uh We know for example babies who are born very close uh together especially who are born within uh less than two year period from the previous birth they are more likely to die uh We also know women who get their first babies uh you know at early age maybe before eighteen nineteen years they are also more likely to suffer pregnancy complications uh and so forth So these are some of the rationale uh for family planning use and if I just quote some figures here you know the RRRthe our population at alarming speed you know it was seven point seven million people in nineteen forty-eight 
<$A> the population in Tanzania 
<$B> Yes when the first census was uh done and this came to twelve point three million in nineteen sixty-seven and in the last census nineteen eighty-eight it was twenty-three point one million So you know our population has tripled in the last forty years
<$A> Could you also tell us about uh the people that you intend to pass this message to Whom are you targeting at 
<$B> Yes uh you know traditionally most messages  has><+_have> been directed to potential clients of family planning you know women uh attending a service somewhere You know they are given messages about family planning and the other people who are potential clients and we have evidence that awareness among people in general has increased uh But we feel people who can make things happen you know people who are in policy makers' position uh you know who can like say we need more contraceptives and they can take necessary actions to order more contraceptives or people who can say we need more messages disseminated to people or we need this kind of resources uh We found these people are least informed and uh maybe this is one reason why they are not really participating to the level which we want them to participate So we thought why don't we target this level you know make messages which are easily understood uh which can be presented in like thirty minutes These people are busy so like thirty minutes presentation and maybe ten minutes of discussion and hope at the end of that we'll generate their support and also their interest in this uh field So it's really we appreciate these are the people who can make things happen and we feel it's important that they are also drawn in as uh partners in this effort
<$A> Now if you are targeting at the Government bureaucracy the decision makers where is the ordinary man left 
<$B> Uh we have uh of course several activities within the Ministry of Health and I'm aware other ministries like uh women development uh We have you know ongoing uh information education communication messages which are going on to these people and in fact they've been successful uh you know you ask people they tell you we know pills we know condoms we know uh whatever But uh we RRRwe feel that this other part these senior officials in different positions are probably less informed and we have assumed that they know but uh we feel that we need to give them more information and we need them to be more actively involved than they are at this stage 
<$A> Are you then saying that the situation is improving
<$B> uh Well I RRRI would say no because uh you know in general we have found awareness is high You ask people they say yes we know pills we know condoms and so forth but when you ask them in detail how does a pill work how do you use a pill how does a pill prevent pregnancy and the other things you find there uh there are obviously serious gaps in knowledge So that is one aspect The other aspect is uh use of family planning is still low We have uh you know national average of about six per cent use of modern contraceptives and when you combine with uh traditional methods it's about ten per cent you know these ten per cent of women in reproductive age and obviously this is very low rate so I think the situation is not improving and in fact the situation requires uh immediate uh effort to try to raise uh family planning use in Tanzania
<$A> Thank you uh In order to be understood in order to achieve your objective there has to be some effective way of uh communicating uh between the project and uh those it aims at for example the decision makers the Government bureaucracy Now how do you get your messages across 
<$B> Uh we are planning to use uh you know method of presentation We have prepared a briefing booklet which summarises the messages we are trying to put across but also we'll need like thirty minutes presentation We'll make the presentation and there are two types of presentations One is a presentation which gives an overview of family planning in Tanzania and uh you know this uh in general it describes history of family planning uh and then it describes why family planning is important uh the current use of family planning and why the current use is low and then it ends with some suggestions for potential strategies which can be used to raise family planning use Uh the second presentation which is the RAPID model presentation uh this is uh really looking at population and development so it's looking at population and its relationship to the economy and to the other indices of development So those are two presentations They are all We are going to use slides or we going to use computers uh and you know uh projection material So those are the modes of presentation and we hope at the end of each presentation we'll have uh some few minutes to discuss and to uh you know raise some questions which you know we hope we will respond or you know the audience will uh participate in responding
<$A> Now apart from the two presentations you're talking about how about the uh seminars for instance face-to-face contact Don't you also use these types to get your messages across 
<$B> Yah yes you are right we are going to use these uh You know we have two approaches one is we'll actively see the possibilities of arranging like seminars workshops In fact one of the things we feel we need like uh seminar one day seminar for you know people who are working in the news media radio you know newspapers and so forth uh and you know we hope to arrange these meetings to other types of groups but the other approach is uh you know what uh we call opportunistic approach We'll try to utilise existing meetings so if there is an existing meeting we ask the organisers if we'll have like thirty minutes within their programme and we make the presentation and so forth But also the presentation will take a form of one to one 
S1B047T
<$A> Welcome once again to our programme of Science Spotlight Last week we heard Dr <name/> a specialist in tuberculosis and the leprosy diseases explaining in details  on> what is leprosy the causes of the disease types of leprosy and how the victims are infected As I promised you last week that we'll have the second and last part in two programmes in a series on leprosy this week Dr <name/> will go on explaining on how leprosy is cured the symptoms of the disease the incubation period of leprosy virus the consequences  of><+_for> leprosy victims and who are the most affected with  the> leprosy She is beginning her explanations on ways to cure leprosy
<$B> Uh yes If you remember my previous statement I said in former years people didn't know uh if at all leprosy was curable because most of them they ended up mutilated But as a matter of fact as science went on uh the UUUsiphons were discovered so the patients were treated by UUUDatson Now with the RRRthe treatment of UUUDatson this is said to be a monotherapy when we say when I say monotherapy it's only one drug And one drug usually is not uh so efficient so the microbacterial lepry might develop resistance Now how come the resistance A patient himself can be lazy because of the irregularity of intake of the tablets or the drugs Now by doing so uh the IIIbac uh the bacilli develop resistance Now the efforts of uh the IIIW WHO and other IIIscienti scientists they discovered other drugs which are more potent because we know that if you treat a case uh with two or more drugs uh the probability of the bacilli to develop resistance is almost negligible So nowadays the patients are being treated with multi-drug-therapy and this multi-drug-therapy in Tanzania is uh iso-protein with uh <O/> And in those days when they were being treated IIIwi with uh UUUDatson the duration was too long and so many of them they just dropped out and then they lost uh faith  on><+_in> the treatment and they said that well they don't feel see any difference in their body but then through that uh the criteria of the bacilli developing resistance and also many patients dropping out so it was decided to use the multi-drug-therapy Uh the multi-drug-therapy reduces also the period of treatment In former years the post-bacillary cases took three years to five to be cured and the multi-bacillary cases uh took uh three years to fifteen that's lifetime But with the IIImult uh multi-drug-therapy for the post-bacillary cases it's only six months if the patient is regular and also uh twenty-four months that's two years with the multi-bacillary case if also one is regular with the intake of the drugs So we say that there's  a> very good progress in the management of leprosy So leprosy is curable Leprosy is not to be feared anymore
<$A> What  are><+_is> the incubational period of the virus of leprosy
<$B> Uh the incubation period of this bacilli or I mean the incubation period of this disease uh is rather an a controversy You see we can say six months to forty years or six years to thirty you know it varies So there hasn't been a  really><+_real> demarcation of saying this is an incubation period of leprosy So leprosy is still uh difficult if you take it on that side of the incubation period because we don't have any vaccine to test uh and also we really don't know when one has the bacilli until the time the disease comes out
<$A> Dr <name/> can you tell me what are the consequences for a victim of leprosy
<$B> Uh Thank you very much You know the consequences of this disease is terrible It's only the consequences that make people build up the uh RRRthe stigma and with the association we are trying to remove that stigma Now uh the consequences of a badly managed case or a case which hides away and doesn't come for  the> help is disability When I say disability it's an area of the body uh being impaired  of><+_in> its normal activities uh for example if one has got leprosy and doesn't come for uh to the hospital one will have the nerve damaged and then there's paralysis of that part of the body and if at all one doesn't turn up for uh help then that paralysis from being soft to will stiffened up So actually it's the disability which comes out as a bad consequence of this disease
<$A> Thank you very much Doctor <name/> Well we've just marked the World Leprosy Day very recently and why efforts has failed to eradicate or to overcome the disease worldwide You being the vice chairperson of Tanzania Leprosy Association you can have a word or two on this
<$B> Well thank you very much Uh I think I'll talk more on Tanzania Uh as being a chair a vice chairperson of the Tanzania Leprosy Association I would say that Tanzania has set a pace forward because uh the number of cases which were being catered since the start of this programme in nineteen seventy-seven until now it's really uh we are very optimistic that the disease will one day be eradicated because from thirty-five thousand cases in nineteen-eighty-three to three thousand four hundred in nineteen ninety-three it's very encouraging So with this we haven't put our tools down We are really working hard on it to try to see if at all we can uh fish out those who are still hiding out to treat them because it's through this way through the radios pamphlets and uh meetings that uh the health education can reach those who are really out IIIo of the city centre to come out and get treated So at least as I say with Tanzania that uh the progress is good as compared to the figures which I've just aired out 
<$A> Dr <name/> we've been dealing with uh leprous cases for quite a long time Now d'you think who are the most affected with the leprosy
<$B> Leprosy doesn't really choose Leprosy is a disease of man Leprosy affects the young and the old the rich and the poor a male and a female So it doesn't choose really
<$A> Doctor being a chairperson of Tanzania Leprosy Association what activities you've been doing until now
<$B> Uh there are several activities which I've been doing The first and foremost for the Tanzania Leprosy Association is health education  to><+_of> the public because we know that once the people get to know what is leprosy they'll be in the position to present themselves early to the health facilities for diagnosis and proper treatment And with our modern drugs we have already succeeded to treat so many cases of leprosy that's why the number of cases have gone down There's a real good and clear decline of leprosy in Tanzania Uh now with that we haven't really uh we haven't stopped to give more efforts to this Now we are trying to strengthen health education  to><+_of> the people because we wouldn't like to see anybody being uh disabled by leprosy
<$A> Thank you IIImu very much Dr <name/> Now for a conclusion Do you have any call to our listeners or the IIIpal I mean those who affected with the leprosy
<$B> Uh yes The community should be prepared to RRRto live with our leprous patients or to live with uh the patients who have been affected by leprosy When I say this when we live we stay with our patients or with our relatives who have been affected by leprosy one we can encourage them to take their drugs two we can share the love between us and third it will help them to RRRto be good uh symbols of good uh examples to the others that I suffered from leprosy at one time but now I'm cured That is  a> pride because one has stayed IIIwith within the community and got cured within it In other words I say that we shouldn't segregate patients leprous patients Uh another thing which I'm going to make it uh clear is that leprosy is no longer to be feared because we've got very efficient drugs and they're available So it's a matter of those who listen and who RRRwho are aware of the uh RRRthe existing problem of leprosy to come forward for examination and then if they are confirmed to have the disease to be treated fully
<$A> So this is the end of our session 
S1B047TB
<$A> The amount of haemoglobin in the blood or the haematrocrit below the normal range The level of occurrence anaemia depends on sex and age A IIInorm a normal man with uh he is said to have an anaemia when the haemoglobin level is below thirteen gram per decilitre while in RRRin a female she is said to have anaemia when the HB I mean the haemoglobin is below eleven gram per decilitre In infants the anaemia is said to be present when the haemoglobin level is below fifteen gram per decilitre And uh in pregnant mothers the haemoglobin level uh below ten gram per decilitre is the one which is considered to be uh anaemia
<$B> Uh you have mentioned the two technical names and these are haemoglobin and haematrocrit What are these words
<$A> Haemoglobin uh is a chemical substance which uh is protein in nature uh found in red blood cells and uh it is uh mainly concerned with the transport of oxygen in the blood While haematrocrit uh in simple  term><+_terms> is uh percentage of blood which is uh red blood cells because we know that blood is made up of uh two major components the plasma and uh red blood cells with other blood cells but haematrocrit in short is the percentage or is the part of the blood which is covered or which constitute is constituted by RBC red blood cells
<$B> What are the symptoms of a person who is having anaemia
<$A> Well there are many symptoms of anaemia and these include uh easy *fatigability> and this means that the individual get tired very easily and uh they have difficulty in breathing especially when they have uh reached the point of cardiac IIIfail failure They also have palpitations Sometimes they have chest pain which we call angina and uh also they have intermittent <O/> fainting and uh lastly swelling of the limbs especially the lower limbs
<$B> What is your main concern in case of uh anaemia Doctor Kitenge
<$A> Uh Well uh our concern as a physiologist uh is uh uh IIIst IIIs we are trying to study uh what are the physical changes which  takes><+_take> place in this patient with anaemia uh In patients with anaemia we have two major problems One is the reduction of oxygen load and the second one reduction of oxygen reserve The these two problems lead  into><+_to> the inability of the blood to supply adequate oxygen in the tissues In normal individual adults the oxygen load to the tissues is about one litre per  minutes><+_minute> Uh but oxygen consumption uh is uh about two fifty mills per  minutes><+_minute> And therefore we have uh about uh seven fifty mills of reserve which we call oxygen reserve This is the RRRthe RRRthe oxygen which is not utilised by the tissue per  minutes><+_minute> In anaemia the oxygen load is less than normal but the consumption remains the same And hence the reserve volume is reduced Therefore an individual will have less oxygen for exercise And therefore symptoms of anaemia occur when this individual is subjected to exertion In fact the cells become hypoxic when the haemoglobin concentration  fall><+_falls> below fifty per cent of the normal What are the <O/> for adaptation in anaemia Uh If an individual is subjected to a reduced oxygen load let's say by fifty per cent suddenly he will have a cerebral depression and cardiac disfunction But the individual with fifty per cent with the same fifty per cent chronic reduced oxygen load uh will have low cerebral disfunction or cardiac malfunction This difference I mean this difference is because of the compensatory mechanisms which  takes><+_take> place in individual with anaemia Individual with anaemia the cardiac output is increased because of vast BBBdilatation<+_dilation> uh and also because of the uh reduced IIIvisco blood viscosity The BBBdilatation<+_dilation> uh is uh the result of uh oxygen uh  deficience><+_deficiency> in the tissues There is a  tendence><+_tendency> that when there is  a> low oxygen in the tissue the blood vessels in this particular tissue uh dilate and this is the one of  theory><+_theories> which is called oxygen demand force When there is a demand  of><+_for> oxygen uh the blood vessels in that particular tissue they dilate Also another cause of vast dilatation is uh hypoxia Hypoxia is a BBBis aRRR term which I described the lower tension of oxygen in the BBBin theRRR tissues And hypoxia has RRRhas a direct effect on the blood vessels and uh therefore they dilate in order to improve uh blood supply that IIIpartic to the tissues Another cause of vast dilatation uh is the accumulation of uh chemical substances in the tissue uh which are the result of uh UUUunaerobic uh metabolism and one of the of these chemical substances is RRRis uh lactic acid and this is exchanged uh by the another theory called uh chemical theory uh which uh is an important uh theory explaining how the local blood supply to tissues is uh regulated Viscosity in uh also  increase><+_increases> uh cardiac outputs because uh the blood will RRRwill pass easily in the blood vessels and therefore there will be uh minimal resistance and therefore the uh amount of blood which will be going to the heart will be uh increased and therefore uh the cardiac pressure will also increase

We present Women's Half-Hour
<$A> It's time once again when we invite you to another programme of Women's Half-Hour Today Dr Augustin Masawe lactation management consultant at the Muhimbili Medical Centre talks about breast-feeding He is being interviewed by Radio Tanzania's <name/> First he outlines the advantages of breast-feeding for children
<$B> One of the advantages which is well-known to all of us is that the best milk from the mother provides the RRRthe RRRthe best nutrient for a child during the first IIIsi four months of life up to six months of life and mothers uh who have been able to adhere to this their babies grow very well without adding anything to the milk things like uh glucose or water or honey and so on so that the other advantage is that IIIis uh for the child survival It is known that uh babies who are breast-fed on mothers' milk they have got uh a protective effect against main infections including diarrhoea which for IIIexam which is the main killer of our children in this country and uh there are other IIIdi infections like acute respiratory tract infection IIIuri urinary tract infection <O/> all these are very common during RRRduring childhood and it has been known that uh even diseases like asthma uh eczema and uh uh uh rhinitis allergy are common in babies who have not been breast-fed during this period Uh the other advantage is that we know that  baby><+_babies> they grow better and they're RRRthey not only physically but they are mentally more intelligent Their the uh RRRthe mother provides a RRRa very strong bonding and this bonding is RRRis both an emotional bonding psycho-social bonding which is very important for the child's survival not only when he's young but uh to RRRto RRRto an adult Uh the other advantage of RRRof breast-feeding in RRRin these children is that uh they even the dental development the jaws and so on disease of RRRof the teeth they are less in babies whose mothers have been breast-feeding. Studies done in developing countries and even in developed countries have IIIshow surely indicated that uh breast-feeding does protect a lot of the malnutrition Uh children who are not breast-fed they RRRthey are not well nourished and uh this is uh very important particularly when you know in this country uh a lot of children are malnourished during the first two years of life and if the babies are breast-fed uh this milk provides not only the good growth of the child but also gives nutrients uh things like uh uh vitamin A are very important in breast milk and also uh other trace elements which are found in breast milk and RRRand this provides better nutrient for the child and also better survival for this particular child
<$A> What about bottle feeding Does it have any effect  to><+_on> the baby
<$B> Oh yes bottle-feeding has got a lot of adverse effects in RRRin RRRin children in fact uh uh the uh RRRthe uh if you have read the literature on RRRon RRRon the history of bottle feeding uh Cecil Williams who is an expert on RRRon bottle feeding from Australia uh clearly indicated about fifty years ago that bottle is a great killer and we have found out in IIIdevelop RRRin developing countries children who have been having bottle-fed uh when they are supposed to be breast-feeding they have uh adverse effects like they get IIIeas IIIdis diarrhoea uh they get uh uh infections and also they don't grow well One of the uh disadvantages of bottle feeding is the economics of bottle feeding Children who are bottle-fed uh the parents have got to incur a lot of expenses to buy milk from the shop A child when he is having diarrhoea or acute respiratory tract infection this child is admitted in  hostel><+_hospital> Parents have IIIgo especially nowadays of cost sharing parents have got to buy medicine and the mothers have got to spend nights and days in  hostel><+_hospital> and this uh disturbs a lot of the economy of the family We know very well the money is going to spend on the treatment of this child and uh it involves the government and the society uh in BBBin inRRR disturbing the economy The other problem which we know in bottle-feeding is that uh uh the mothers uh who have been bottle IIIfeed feeding these children they don't again go back to RRRto RRRto RRRto breast-feed their children which actually results  to><+_in> malnutrition and which is a big killer in this country
<$A> For how long a mother should breast her baby
<$B> Well uh it is recommended that a mother should breast-feed her baby exclusively that we stress that exclusive breast-feeding during the first four and six months There are babies who can get very enough milk even up to six month without adding anything to the baby but we know that uh uh babies can be uh get accustomed slowly when they are already four months of age to the locally made available food-stuff at home like <ea/>uji in some uh or any type of cereal which the baby can get at home the uh and the baby should continue breast-feeding after starting the complementation and it's strongly recommended to continue up to two years or even beyond
<$A> Dr Masawe there is another problem that uh some mothers in this country or elsewhere in this world breast-feed their babies sometimes only three months and thereafter nothing is coming out What do we do to such women
<$B> That's a very good question uh This uh problem of the mothers stop breast-feeding at uh around three months or even earlier there are some mothers even who breast-feed and after about one month they say they have not enough milk Well there are a lot of reasons uh which are BBBwhich areRRR due to this One is that uh IIIeducati lack of education The other thing is uh some taboos uh influence some mothers to breast-feed their children for only one or two months because they introduce uh other foods other than breast milk too early and therefore when the baby for example starts <ea/>uji at two months and the baby's stomach gets full up the child cannot feed and therefore when we put the babies to breast then the baby RRRbaby can't suck the mother cannot produce milk and therefore when the baby sucks an empty breast he will automatically refuse because this mother gets then gets a vicious circle my child is not sucking and the baby gets angry because the mother is not producing enough milk and therefore the mothers the mother and the child they are all stressed and they end up mother saying look I RRRI can't breast-feed my child And that's one of the main  reason><+_reasons> and that's why we encourage mothers to get all the support not only uh in the  hostel><+_hospital> but home also the society can give support to these mothers yeah and they can continue uh doing so until they are two years I understand that there are mothers who are working Usually in Tanzania the maternity leave is very short uh for a breast-feeding mother This should be actually uh prolonged so that the mothers are able to provide this very important nutrient to their babies and even when they are uh BBBthey areRRR working mothers
<$A> It is also believed that uh breast-feeding is best for mothers How is it useful
<$B> Well uh breast-feeding is actually very useful to the mother One or the best uh uh  examples><+_example> we can give is it provides a natural protection against uh early pregnancy If the child is exclusively breast-feeding the mother will get lactational UUUmnoria and will get uh uh IIIpot uh uh a natural contraception and therefore will not get uh uh uh pregnant Two the mother uh gets uh love if particularly if the family is involved and in RRRin taking care of a mother who is lactating and also it RRRit helps the mother to remove the extra fat which she gained during pregnancy which is important for ladies to remember this because even if you put on twelve kilos during pregnancy I can assure you that it will go away by the time you have been breast-feeding for the first six months but if you breast-feed for only two months uh is very difficult to uh remove all that fat which was laid down for the baby and also for you
<$A> Uh what about fathers uh Breast-feeding is also best for them
<$B> Yes uh uh the fathers of course they should understand this If you have got a mother who is breast-feeding uh we have stressed the RRRthe RRRthe love the warmth the economy and the uh BBBand the uhRRR BBBand theRRR growth of the child both mentally and physically and uh if you have got a healthy child at home who is not going to BBBhostel><+_hospital> because of diarrhoea because the mother didn't breast-feed the father will be very happy yeah and also not only that If the father is a supporting husband to his wife then uh this particular wife will also get this uh very important support and the father will be even a happier father and IIIac RRRand they actually could spend more time at home instead of spending his money to drink away while the mother is busy breast-feeding and yet another thing with the fathers which they should do to help the mothers so that they will be able to breast-feed is to make sure that the mother is resting having some rest during lactation because if the mother doesn't get enough rest then she does not have uh she does not produce enough milk and uh she uses her energy to do other works which the father actually can help like looking for firewood water particularly in Tanzania whereby mothers they have got to walk miles even RRReven RRR even for hours and the BBBand theRRR father is IIIsi sitting at home And I think it's important for fathers to really give this nice support and they will be both happy and uh also if you can space your children yeah then you have got you have you can plan actually when you are going to have your children and these issues can only be discussed and uh and understood if the father also  take><+_takes> the initiative in learning the advantages of breast-feeding
<$A> I have another interesting question Dr Masawe that some tribes in this country like the Wagogo prefer to feed their babies using one breast Do you think that is the best way
<$B> No nature it's provided a human being with two breasts one on the left on the right Animals if they have got many puppies like uh RRRlike uh RRRlike goats or even the lions they have got many more breasts This is a natural survival and human beings have been BBBhave beenRRR BBBhave beenRRR created by god that uh they have two breasts that means you have got enough too for that child and uh RRRand uh it's unfortunate that you RRRyou have actually found this in Dodoma Not only Dodoma in Singida in Coast-region and so on there is a belief among which is a RRRa bad taboo and needs a lot of uh education looking deep into the roots and causes of this but uh this is not the right way of uh actually practising this method Unilateral breast-feeding uh does produce uh insufficient milk to the child yeah Unless the mother has got a disease on one breast in a lot of breast-feeding it should be discouraged Taboos which are or uh bad cultures which are encouraging unilateral breast-feeding like in Dodoma and Singida should be discouraged and uh RRRand uh these mothers are the ones  which><+_who> actually who should be be able to be educated particularly the community where she lives So this culture can IIIslow slowly die away
<$A> Can you give us uh the trend of breast-feeding in this country Is it rising or declining or stagnant
<$B> Yeah the trend if you look at the trend in the urban areas the trend of breast-feeding is on the decline Figures quoted in from Dar es Salaam uh uh mothers uh uh who are in urban areas uh particularly the high income group the tendency to breast-feed has declined and in the rural areas uh it is supposed to be about hundred per cent who breast-feed But what is very IIIimpor what is very interesting is that the exclusive breast-feeding is also IIIi on the decline even in the rural areas and uh this could be the RRRthe introduction of uh RRRof uh urban RRRurban culture into the villages where people have thought uh that bottle feeding is uh superior to breast-feeding and I think uh this should be uh known to all Tanzanians that this trend uh should be actually kept to the maximum that our children are totally breast-fed that means UUUclose breast-fed and continue breast-feeding and that's why we have got uh uh this programme on uh educating health workers in particular and educating the community yeah and we'd like the mass media to RRRto continue this nice programme so that the community can be well conversant with the advantages of breast-feeding 
S1B049T
<$B> Well Tanzania Occupational Health Service its major objective is preventive services to ensure healthy workforce in our industries So we have to think of the major objectives in ensuring occupational health amongst the work force and uh one of the objectives of ensuring occupational health amongst the workforce is uh uh uh RRRis IIIlight is enlightening the workforce from the BBBfrom theRRR roots and ways of preventing uh occupational hazards and where occupational hazards are not easy to prevent uh we happen to get a lot of injured workforce at the places of work So the objective of this short course was to equip uh employees as well as employers and those who are interested in uh safeguarding the life of an injured person with the knowledge and techniques of uh industrial first aid
<$C> Did you have specific qualifications for the participants who were involved in the course
<$B> Well we did We actually did because we did announce in our local media The Daily News uh the seminar when it was supposed to take place the dates the venue and the duration and in the announcement we did exactly specify what quality of personnel we needed to attend the course uh We wanted the industrial uh safety officers We wanted foremen shift supervisors uh We also wanted some individuals from the management of the organisations because uh industrial first aid provision is an expensive affair You've got to purchase some equipment You've got to have uh the gadgets ready available at the place of work so that you could provide industrial uh first aid So we RRRwe did specify exactly whom we need for the course and it is not actually very proper that you've got to have qualified individuals to do industrial first aid uh You can have anybody because industrial first aid or first aid as such is provided everywhere It's provided on the major highways It's provided in industries It's provided at home It's provided even in offices It's provided well uh practically everywhere So it's proper that everybody every able adult should be able to know uh something about first aid as such
<$C> I would like also to know whether the course was a practical one or you just did it theoretically 
<$B> Well uh we RRRwe did manage to get a very good comment from one of the participants because we did actually manage to intermarry theory and practicals and we believe that the participants did actually benefit from both theory and the practicals which we did uh provide them 
<$C> Can you tell us the what exactly made you to involve workers only to attend the course
<$B> Well thanks Penzi You know the our clients who whom we give uh services in this organisation are mainly employees in industries uh The major question is I mean industries are not only those working with machines in factories producing you know uh finished goods No agriculture is also an industry So when we say that our clients are workers in industry we don't mean only the workers working with machinery in factories we also mean uh every able person who is working uh So what we actually did it was not the intention was not to involve only the workers but our major clients whom we provide services in this organisation are employers and employees of the surrounding uh industries So we did target the workers of these particular industries to attend the seminar
<$C> It is so simple to say first aid but uh I think to medicine people it might uh mean or it might involve many things Now what do we mean by first aid
<$B> Okay thank you very much Well the definition of first aid is a bit complicated but we can easily just say that it is actually the initial but essential treatment provided to an injured individual as a step towards more competent hospital treatment So it is a life uh saving situation which a first aider is first with on the initial step of uh ensuring the BBBthe theRRR the saving of an injured the saving of life of an injured person
<$C> Is it possible for an ordinary person uh who is not a nurse or a doctor to provide first aid service
<$B> Well sure well you remember at the beginning I said that it is very important for uh an adult to know something about first aid and the necessity why we think that uh every adult should know something about first aid is just imagine at home your child could most probably grab a bottle of let's say drugs or poison accidentally and drink it and uh you don't know what to do but in the short course we had there was a topic of poisoning by mouth that is the participants were enlightened on what to do and how to handle an injured person who has been poisoned by mouth So it is very possible for an ordinary person It's possible for a mother It's possible for a father It's possible for a you know somebody who just is a street vendor to know something about first aid and to be able to provide first aid to an injured person
<$C> Let us now go more practically as far as first aid is concerned then how would one assist a person or while on duty his leg or arm is cut off by an object
<$B> Okay thanks very much Penzi uh That's an interesting question uh I remember when I was young my dad once told me that if you see somebody bitten by a snake what you do first is you RRRyou put a UUUtonicate on the proximal end of the bitten limb in order to prevent the uh up-flow of the poison to the circulatory system uhm and then I think what he said was having done that you've got to get a razor blade or a sharp object and you make a thorough cut a deep cut on the bitten side so that the poison would uh ooze out Well your question was how would one assist a person whose arm or leg has been cut off I think the major threatening of life in that aspect is the injured person is <slang/>gonna bleed to death because there are major blood vessels which are widely open after the amputation of the limb So the first idea what I think uh a first aider should do is to ensure that there is no unnecessary blood loss uh to the cut-off leg or arm as you said So what he's supposed to do first is apply a UUUtonicate Now you apply a UUUtonicate on the proximal side of the amputated limb in order to prevent uh blood loss and again you make sure that you rush the patient very fast to a nearby uh hospital where proper surgical toilet could be done and proper hemostasis so the blood vessels could be tied
<$C> Now what happens when a person who got an accident would not be able to get first aid service and let us say when life is threatened
<$B> Okay that's a good question because you said when life is threatened yeah It's true uh let's look at it this way supposing somebody is involved in an accident and uh let us assume that he's got an artificial danger in his mouth and this artificial danger uh slips into the throat and most probably blocks the airway Well uh for a first aider when he observes such an injured person the first thing he's got to note is whether the RRRthe injured person is breathing or not breathing If he's not breathing the first step is to make sure that the injured person is breathing So when he looks into the airways the nose the mouth he might find that there are these artificial dangers blocking the airway So the first thing he's got to do is to get it out and uh place the injured person in a manner that the airway's free so that uh he or she can breathe easily uh Depends on the speed of how the first aider could do this uh injured person could start breathing normally and in such a situation where life was exactly threatened the first aider has managed to save the life of the individual
<$C> I remember you told us that one of the objectives of the course was to equip the industrial or to equip industrial people with the knowledge on first aid uh Do you have other reasons that have prompted you to conduct such a course
<$B> Oh yes sure well uh It's a BBBit's aRRR question of being useful to the public uh Prevention they say is better than cure uh If you think I mean if you take into consideration the liberalisation nowadays of uh our industries and the liberalisation of the economy of the nation uh there are so many things which we are importing right now in terms of raw materials in terms of machinery and these raw materials and machinery do not take into account the safety of the workforce So the major reason again why we thought that first aid is important amongst the workforce is to safeguard them with the pending idea that the safety of the work environment is uh endangered
<$C> I am sure most of the participants uh were those who have uh a bit of knowledge about health issues Now why should you involve such people in that course while they are already well educated about health issues
<$B> Uh not really I wouldn't say that all the participants were amongst the individuals with the knowledge on uh medical issues or health issues No we had some engineers and we had some uh shift supervisors We had some industrial safety officers and also we had the medical personnel and their nurses uh that is UUUdent doctors in various workplaces but this doesn't matter really because there is uh a proverb of which says that repetition is the mother of knowledge Well whether you are a doctor or a nurse and whether you passed through uh the academic ladders of classrooms you've got to keep on attending seminars attending workshops you know seeing new developments in medical field and uh the major reason I think why we did involve such persons with uh medical knowledge is we also wanted to share the experiences in their place of work and uh also we wanted to train them so that they can train others on the industrial first aid so it was a matter of a give and take affair Those who had something to give us we were very thankful we got it from them and those had something to get from us I think we are also thankful that we managed to give them something
<$C> How successful is the course so far
<$B> Well uh we did evaluate the course We did evaluate We did some evaluation after the course and we did manage to get some comments from the participants uh I would most probably mention a few comments One of the comments was that they feel that the course was rather short They felt that we could give it about two more days to make it at least a week or five days and uh also they felt that some of the periods were too short to be able to cope with uh both theory and practical so they suggested that the periods could be a bit longer So if you got longer periods then you'll have more days of the seminar and again they some of them mentioned that they never knew that this organisation has the objective of ensuring health and safety at workforce So it was their pleasure to know that and uh they also managed to give us a pat on the back that the course should be conducted more frequently and we did appreciate their comments So in conclusion we said that the seminar or the short course was very successful
<$C> So you have an intention of organising another seminar of the same kind in future
<$B> Well Penzi you know we organise such seminars every now and then and we've got a schedule We've got a total of three short courses which we will conduct in the course BBBin the courseRRR of the year We have an industrial first aid for the uh low cadres and we have industrial first aid course for the uh trainers and we have health and safety at work uh for uh the industrial safety officers for the uh workshop officers for the production section and also for the resident medical officers 

S1B050T
<$A> I understand that uh you are a health officer and you have been dealing with uh primary health care for over fifteen years So would you be kind enough to state what are the oral health goalsfor the year discussed or for five years
<$B> Thank you Oral health goals for Zanzibar year two thousand and three are comparable with similarly oral health goals for mainland Tanzania mainland I mean We have divided these goals in three primary secondary and tertiary The primary goals requiring preventive educational and investigative activities Goal number one The percentage of five to six years old who will be caries-free is tentatively fixed at fifty per cent That is goal number one Goal number two The prevalence of endemic fluorosis needs further investigation before the IIIrevel revelance of goals can be determined Goal number three Twelve-year-old children will on average have no more than two point five DMFT that is decayed missing and filled teeth Goal number four In twelve-year-olds <O/> bleeding will occur in no more than two sextant <O/> CPITN index Goal number five in primary goalEighty per cent of population should retain all their teeth excluding molars at the age of eighteen Primary goal number six More data on the level of UUUedentulousness within the age group thirty-five to forty-four and fifty-five and above are needed before setting a goal If uh there is any UUUedentulous at the age of thirty-five uh You know the meaning of the word UUUedentulous Toothless mouth uh Primary goal number seven All uh RRRall mothers attending MCH clinics and all twelve-year-old primary school pupils will receive oral health education as part of general health education programmes Also there's these secondary goals which require curative activities In IIIprimar in primary goals we need only preventive educational and investigative only but in secondary we require curative and this one is much expensivein implementing Goal number eight we continue Seventy-two per cent of the DMFT index in twelve-year-old children will be composed of the decayed component Goal number nine Twenty per cent of the DMFT index in twelve-year-old children will be composed of the missing component and number ten eight per cent eight per cent of the DMFT index in twelve-year-old children will be composed of the filling component and the third tertiary goal this requiring administrative activities Goal eleven from this tertiary goal the entire population will have access to IIIequitable equitably distributed emergency and preventive oral health services within less than half a day's journey from their place of residence and the last goal A data-based system for monitoring changes in oral health and the implementation of oral health programmes will be established
<$A> Oh Thank you very much What I have observed or what I have heard from you is that your oral health goals suggested for the year two thousand and three have been formulated in accordance with World Health Organisation recommendations regarding health for all by year two thousand
<$B> RRRuhu
<$A> Is that okay
<$B> RRRuhu 
<$A> And uh they are nearly the same as the Tanzanian mainland
<$B> RRRuhu
<$A> So what uh or rather let's say which strategies or do you have any strategies which can be applied in order to approach the goals for the year two thousand and three
<$B> RRRuhu At present there are few data available on this particular age group For goal number one I mean 
<$A> RRRuhu
<$B> Because we have divided each goal and the strategies so it will therefore be necessary to carry outclinical IIIepidemi epidemiological survey to set an accurate goal uh The provisional percentage is a rough estimate derived from the corresponding goal of sixty to sixty-five per cent for mainland Achieving awareness of oral health and disease as well as daily oral hygiene habits in young children and their mothers through oral health education in the MCH clinics is going to bemain contribution for this age group throughout the current five year period Okay Should sign of sustained increase of caries arise IIIcom combined with a change in the pattern of caries progression to other occlusal surfaces a fluoride intervention programme might be considered in particular the feasibility of fluoridation of piped drinking water in Zanzibar town As in goal number two this strategy is about fluoride <O/> Existing level of naturally occurring fluoride in drinking water are knownfor Zanzibar town only because there RRRthere is no proper data In order to decide onproper means of dental caries prevention mapping of fluoride contents of drinking water should be undertaken as a minimum in areas suspected of dental UUUfluorosis for example the coastal area between Uwa and Jambiani RRRuhu Okay No question From goal number two uh and goal number three and four these usually go together The DMFT for children aged twelve to thirteen begins around two point five Therefore the goal of two point five for that two RRRtwo thousand and three <O/> and<O_><O/> of status quo And as for UUUperiodontal disease the goal has been set arbitrarily using the mainland criteria although recommended by WHO uh the CPITN for this age group has not yet been introduced But in Zanzibar like in many other countries the twelve-year-olds have been selected as the main group
<$A> uh I'm sorry to intervene you have said that what is the meaning of CPITN
<$B> This is a the RRRthe special index we are using to represent community UUUperiodontal index of treatment needs On examination of these pupils or these IIIchi children we are using this reflecting index to detect their problem in their mouth Okay I think you get it 
<$A> Yah
<$B> As I said Zanzibar is a country where twelve-year-olds are the pilot RRRpilot group okay for prevention or intervention as you know Primary or level number two will be <O/> with the aid of this age group that means twelve-year-olds Actually combined with twelve-year-olds standard four to five mainly standard four to five RRRuhu
<$A> Well I think uh I've got the strategies and I think there are so many but uh from the few which I have got I think uh you know as a health officer here in charge I think you are in charge here Have you taken any trouble onvisiting areas very important areas like schools because I've heard that you mention pupils or in rural areas to RRRto give them any dental health education because what I have noticed from your point uh is that the age you mention there rangefrom five years old to fifteen to sixteen years old and uh if you go there to visit uh those pupils uh what do you recommend them to do and how far you are going thereto maybe RRRto check if they are uh doing what you are telling them to do
<$B> Well up to now from where we've set these goals we are facingmany problems especially these financial problems To set goals it is very simple you know because it's just to sit on a tableand then writing
<$A> Yah
<$B> but in implementing you're going to face a lot of problems As you know the problem comes like transport First of all to reach tothe BBBto theRRR schools or in clinics for example in poorer rural areas it is difficult for us uh We're havingthis problem of transport and once you have this transport and you reach there sometimes you can find that they are not well prepared to RRRto meet us because the information maybe was not proper but we are trying to reach them and mainly we are trying to go to these clinics MCH clinics because we want to start to give mothers oral health education because when you treat a BBBtreat aRRR woman when you treat a woman you treat a family as you know So we are trying to teach mothers how to take care of their of the teeth BBBof theRRR of their children and then because this it costs less I think you can say that just the transport will be enough to reachbut when you want to go to schools you need more things You need to teach the pupils to do some pretty things like tooth brushing and then let's say play RRRplay these games because you have so many activities in schools but in MCH programme you can see they're just BBBthey're justRRR talking and I think we are trying to communicate with these DANIDA so they can help us supply these things so we can implement properly these goals we have already settled I think I have answered your
<$A> Yes but uh I don't think I'm prying on your mattersbut uh after all who is the BBBwho is theRRR donor maybe of this programme because what I know is that uh things like dental health care or any other thing I think they are connected with big uh organisations in donor countries 
<$B>As I said actually these Danish I mean DANIDA are sponsoringThey promised us to supply many many things so we are waiting but we RRRwe have already started to do these things which can be implemented without having transport attending MCH clinics which are very nearby including towns or schools which are in towns But the problem actually is uh the children in schools because our problem main problem is once you go to school you teach uh the pupil how to RRRto clean your teeth RRRuhu how to know which tooth is bad which is good Once they've found out they have got a bad tooth then they'll come
<$A> to your clinic
<$B> and I think there are going to be many many pupils because we have IIIsta BBBwe haveRRR started to visit town schools primary schools in town And as you know in town there is much more dental caries than in rural IIIarea areas I think you know why
<$A> No
<$B> This is because of sugar consumption in towns They've got these pipis chewing gums and so on That's available in town then so
<$A> But in rural areas I think they have things like sugar canes and maybe other things
<$B> Actually sugar cane is not uh you RRRyou RRRyou wouldn't call it as a <O/> food because when you chew uh let's say when you chew this sugar cane you will chew until finally you're going to brush your teeth with the BBBwith theRRR what you call uh after you have chewed the 
<$A> remainder 
<$B> yah yah I mean the remainder of the You are going to brush your teeth with that So as you know the dangerous sugar we are saying here is these <O/> because they are sticking 
<$A> Well then I think I have to thank you very much for providing me or supplying me with this information Thank you very much
<$B> Thank you

We present Women's Half Hour We are glad to invite you once again to another programme of Women's Half Hour Today we'll present the activities of the Centre for Children's Rights in Mwanza Some people have the tendency of neglecting children for no reason but others have the feeling that children are the most valuable in a society and so they should be given all necessary basic needs That is  the> exactly what the Centre for Children's Rights popularly known as UUU Koleanado in Mwanza to promote the welfare of children The centre was established in nineteen ninety-three but it has done tremendous efforts towards children's development In this interview with Radio Tanzania's <name/> Mungumi the Director of the Centre Mustafa <name/> outlines the main activities of the organisation He begins by telling us the kind of rights they're fighting for the children in Mwanza 
<$B> Well what we're trying to do is fight for all the rights of children in Mwanza Uh if you take into account the UN convention for the rights for the child which Tanzania has already signed uh there are about eighteen rights that are encompassed in that BBBin thatRRR convention uh These include rights for a child to have access to good health services access to education especially primary education access to uh uh BBBto their basic IIInee having their basic needs met and that includes having shelter access to a loving respectful environment and access to a place to play a place where they can come and children can call their own and make it whatever they would like to make it make of it 
<$C> And uh which RRRwhich type of children do you concentrate  with><+_on>
<$B> Okay currently we're working mainly with street children in Mwanza and by street children I mean those who have been completely abandoned and are on the streets of RRRof Mwanza who are not with any adult uh who are trying to make do with life on their own 
<$C> And why the street children alone because we have the orphans and those coming from poor families and uh I think they all need to get their rights What is so special to the street children 
<$B> Well the issue really is RRRis a voice I mean street children children in general are not very well heard in our society and they RRRthey RRRthey tend to be neglected they tend to be put on the side when they have a suggestion to make you say uh you're just a child stay away from me but when you look at the issue of street children because even among children you have different hierarchies well street children are the most marginalised of all children Their voices are not heard uh They are often interpreted in very negative ways Either they're thieves they're trouble makers uh in Swahili <ea/>wajambasi in all kinds of ways which RRRwhich portray them negatively so when they try to say something let's say look we need access to education we need access to shelter we need access to uh RRRto a good place to have a shower for all that it matters nobody listens Everyone is quiet There's not a single group in RRRin RRRin There's not very many groups that have taken up their issues and said we'll work with you we'll work with you we'll fight together with you we'll fight for your rights Unfortunately because this is a world that is IIIadul that is interpreted through adults' eyes and adults' voices the children need adult supporters to be with them so that their voices can be heard and UUUKoleana is an organisation which is here to do that to be with the children so that they can fight for their own rights 
<$C> That's very interesting Mustafa but uh I would like also to know how many children do you provide them with the accommodation at the centre 
<$B> Okay the accommodation as I said before is just very basic stuff When we started we didn't intend to have accommodation We were BBBWe wereRRR hoping to make the street safer for the children but that hasn't worked uh partly because the adult world is so hostile to the children so what we have provided are bamboo RRRbamboo beddings which are very popular here in Mwanza and we put them on the veranda and the children sleep on them and they have a bedsheet to cover them with Uh but it's open-air sleeping full of mosquitoes We've put some mosquito coils but uh we still have a lot of malaria infection We're not intending to put up anything big because it's extremely extremely expensive to build and one mattress for example the cheapest mattress here in Mwanza costs something like fifteen or sixteen thousand shillings Multiply that by hundred and you have a massive figure and the number of children keeps increasing so we would like our capacity to work with children not to be limited uh by providing them with full-time shelter 
<$C> That is at least an accommodation and rather than sleeping  in><+_on> the pavements Anyway now what do you do to them next Do you send them to school or what do you do in order to make them feel as part and parcel of the society 
<$B> Well there's a whole lot of issues The first and most important thing is all their basic needs are met here By basic needs I mean they have access to a RRRa good toilet system They have access to good showers Some of them have access to lockers We're in the process of building more lockers more cupboards for the children to keep their clothes in When you think of how people get really angry when they give a child some clothes The child was on the streets and you see them throw away their old clothes and put on the new ones and just keep those old clothes away but then when you think about it they threw them away because they have no place to keep them and here in Tanzania it's too hot to have two pairs of clothes on at the same time if you want to preserve them so what we are trying to provide each child with is a safe space to keep their extra clothes some of their extra belongings because you need that if you want to survive on the streets uh More than that they have access to basic health services As you know health services are no longer free in Tanzania but street children often don't have the money to access these services in the first place so what we are providing through help from UNICEF and uh uh a German group called Action Medior is we provide them with free medical services right here at our centre There's an assistant medical officer who helps us with these issues 
<$C> Uh when I was walking around I met with some of them and they said you just provide them with shelter but no food why is that so 
<$B> Okay that's always uh a big issue A lot of people in the community have confronted us with about it uh The issue is this when we first started this work we did we didn't just start it by putting up a centre and deciding what was best for the children We talked with the children We found out what was important in their lives and we also followed them around to find out how they were surviving and one of the RRRthe issues is street children are incredibly resilient they are incredibly creative about finding ways to survive and one of the things we found out was each one has very legal jobs that they were doing to get food for themselves and our intention here at the centre is to build on what the children already know what the children are already doing rather than taking away all of what is important to them and RRRand saying we know what is best for you We don't know what is best for the children The children themselves know what is best for them So they work in food stores They work selling uh chewing gum and sweets They work at RRRat making <O/> This is Mwanza We have a big lake so they are the ones who have fishing lines and go and fish because you can fish in RRRin two hours you get enough fish to RRRto get money for three BBBfor threeRRR good meals that particular day So they are doing very well on their own We do provide food for those who are very young We have children who're four years old five years old all the way to children who are about eight We provide food to all the children who are on medical care and we provide food for children who are on specific programmes like those who are going to school They get breakfast and lunch but they still have to after their homework they have to go out and work to get money for their dinner uh Other than that what we try to do is make sure that the child is getting good nutritious meals wherever they're working 
<$C> Okay can you tell us uh how old is the youngest uh as well as the oldest one at the centre
<$B> The youngest one as I said Hamisi is four years old He's been on the streets for about a year now uh The oldest one is fifteen and that's only because we have set a limit There are street youths we're working with that we have some kind of relationship with they are about uh twenty twenty-one and they go onwards because there are a lot of people who've been on the streets for a very long time but we work mainly with IIIfour I mean with all children up to fifteen years of age 
<$C> uh you know Mustafa street children have already used to go to roam about in town and uh sleeping  in><+_on> the pavements now how did you manage to convince them to join you with the centre 
<$B> Uh it was actually quite easy because what we did was we worked in the streets ourselves Uh lots of people in town who knew we had been to university and we had studied thought we were crazy spending all our time on the streets sitting in the hot sun on a pavement with the children but what we did was build relationships with the children showed them that we were there we were their friends and then we started talking with them getting to learn what was important to them so if they needed health care we accompanied them to the government hospital uh For those who had been arrested under the hooliganism and vagrancy act and taken to prison we'd be there in the courts defending them So slowly they realised that we were with them we were supporting them and we wanted to work with them So up to now at this centre often people ask us how do you round up the children Well we don't round up the children The children come on their own They're free to leave when they want to and they're free to come in when they want to New children aren't We don't go out on the streets looking for new children to pull in Other children who are already members of our programme when they see a new child on the streets will immediately say look if you want a nice place to shower a nice place a warm place to sleep well why don't you come to UUUKoleana and we'll get registered So the children themselves bring other children in That's what the name of our organization is all about as well We're called UUUKoleana which means supporting one another nurturing one another and that is one thing that the IIIchi RRRthe street children have always had because they don't have adult supporters in this world they at least have support of each other Of course you see them fighting and doing things like that but ultimately they know they're in it together not with It's not the adults who are important it's RRRit's each other that's most important

This is Spotlight on Tanzania In this week's edition of Spotlights on Tanzania we focus on Rural Medical Aid's Training Centre in Songea Ruvuma region Welcome to the programme 
<$A> The centre was established in nineteen seventy-three UUUbeing entrusted by the task of training rural medical aides to man our rural dispensaries This particular centre recruits class seven leavers who receive a three-year course in various medical subjects The Songea based Rural Medical Training Centre currently has a total of one hundred and seven students who are eager to finish their courses and work with the rural people The centre's operations will come to light after talking with the centre's administration members of the staff and students To set the pace in motion the centre's principle Dr <name/> summarises the RRRthe centre's activities and set-up
<$B> Uh this institution was uh  found><+_founded> in nineteen seventy-three uh by the following objectives training village health workers at a dispensary level Uh we have several departments in this training institution uh To start with we have principal's office which deals with the administration finance management students' curriculum implementation We have the next IIIdep department which is uh vice principal's office which is uh co-ordinating the studies which are uh uh running around the RRRthe RRRthe institution throughout the RRRthe duration of uh  instructions><+_instruction> Then we have the IIIst staff office Here is where the different tutors are uh supposed to meet and prepare for their lessons before they move to their classes We have the finance office whereby the finance matters are being uh taken care of and then we have others like typing pool stores and we have several drivers who all in all help us greatly to make uh to facilitate the activities which are going around in this institution Uh we have about as I have said already we have about one hundred and seven students uh uh First years uh about thirty-seven students We have uh thirty-eight students second year students and thirty-two students uh who are the finalists in this institution Uh the training course uh is of a three year period or three year instructional period uh We have first years uh RRRsecond second year and third year In the first year the students learn uh in the current first six months they learn English medical mathematics simple sciences including biology physics chemistry and patients' care uh just to make them become much more orientated to the language which they are going to uh uh RRRto use most of the time when they go or they move into the next block The second years this is the clinical year when uh different clinical subjects are being taught to them uh subjects like environmental sanitation communicable diseases pathology surgery Uh these are the key subjects together with the pharmacology which  is><+_are> the uh key subjects to make them clinically orientated so that they will go and uh help these people in the villages and we have uh after finishing after BBBthe a successful finishing of the training uh these students are supposed to be posted by the ministry to different uh regions in this country uh and therefore the ministry is responsible for posting them to different regions and especially at different villages to work as village health workers Thank you 
<$A> That was Dr <name/> the centre's principal To follow in the footpaths of Dr <name/> the administrative structure now is the office of the vice principal Dr <name/> who's also the centre's academic officer who apart from his administrative duties and teaching also makes hospital rounds to attend to the patients Our second step now is to know about the regulations of recruitment of students and academic aspects of the centre Dr <name/>
<$C> Well as a registered medical IIIoff practitioner the regional medical officer of this region assigns to me some duties both in the hospital wards and in the different clinics just like other medical officers Uh in this school I'm the vice principal who assists the principal in all administrative duties and  take><+_takes> over the administration in the principal's absence A vice principal is the chief academic officer so I have to study the school curriculum very effectively prepare all the class timetables allocate the teachers and tutors who come from in and outside the school IIIknow as the known as part time teachers and tutors I have always to see that weekly and monthly tests are conducted as planned I also have to prepare all the student rosters which  assigns><+_assign> them some practical duties in the hospital wards and outpatient departments and also conduct all the tutorial sessions in the hospital And also twice every year I have to move in the villages with the second and third year students to do a community survey prepare the community medicine rosters and then supervise the maternal and child health clinics in the district health uh BBBin the district healthRRR centres Uh sometimes I do face some problems particularly regarding transport uh fuel and the bad roads during the rainy seasons and sometimes shortage of food And this always UUUpoints to the students that uh they would complain to the school authority that the fuel allowances are insufficient Well uh even all these are like this the success has been so nice as uh forementioned Thank you very much 
<$A> That was the vice principal of the training centre In order to ensure that there is harmony between the administrators and students there is a bridge in between in the name of warden he is <ea/>Ndugu <name/> who painstakingly follows up all issues involved How does he go about it <ea/>Ndugu <name/>
<$D> Well on my side as a warden uh there are some responsibilities which I actually uh they My responsibility is uh are successful when I'm co-ordinating between the students and the RRRthe school administration or the institutional administration Now for better co-ordination between the staff and the students that means discipline is the paramount thing which should be observed Now regarding discipline as such actually my duty is just to RRRto RRRto try and maintain and see that the students are they are in line with the school regulations uh as provided by the ministry So in short we have BBBwe haveRRR BBBwe haveRRR some regulations which I can't mention all here It might take too much time but just to RRRto RRRto RRRto RRRto point out some of the important disciplinary aspects is that we have to observe that uh students are within the school premises at defined times or that the students are following the periods as co-ordinated by our institutional co-ordinator as well as the timing maybe for meals should be punctual in such a way that they don't interfere with the uh time allocated for different periods and then not forgetting again on the disciplinary aspect is that unless the students have no problems regarding maybe studies or regarding their welfare uh so we should expect that there might be some problems Now some of the problems could be uh maybe we could say BBBwe couldRRR tell <lexeme> as domestic problems Now these problems could be uh something to do with the meals It could be something to do with the health It could be something to do with learning materials and even the security of the students So in all these aspects there could crop some problems and now how do I get  these problems from the BBBfrom the studentsRRR Now we have the as in our government we have <O/> leaders but here we have leaders in each dormitory so they are the people who are actually to some extent they are vested with the responsibility to RRRto keep some of the regulations going well and when they uh single out any problem the first person to RRRto face is going to be the warden so actually I'm getting the first hand information whenever possible But as you know sometimes the information can skip  me according to the BBBaccording to theRRR magnitude of the problem So on those respect there are some problems which I can solve but if there are problems which are beyond my capability then I have to send these problems to the higher administrative organ Now there could be some disciplinary behaviour such as maybe a student is too late to come or to report or maybe some students have slept out of the campus or maybe a student is not attending classes well or sometimes even the uh RRRthe meal regulations or timing is not observed So all these problems they are first uh directed to me and I try to solve to my capacity and then actually most of them would be uh solved and then there is the co-ordination between students and the staff and students and the other subordinates That is again requires the co-ordination of various jobs to these subordinates uh That means I have to arrange the duties of maybe the drivers sometimes the duties for the cooks the duties for office attendance so that generally we have a calm and uh surrounding which is more or less in peace and maybe tranquillity so to say Also there are health problems that means as a warden I have to produce a roster for our clinic We have a clinic and then I have to produce a roster uh in which uh one doctor or a medical assistant is to prescribe or to take care of the sick students for a week Now this is also a co-ordination between the students and the teachers or the doctors and medical assistants Again that clinic is also uh serving our  staffs><+_staff> the rest of the staff that means the tutors and the other subordinates In short unless there is a big problem that is when we sit together with the principal and vice principal together with the staff but in most cases I RRRI try my best to solve some problems from the students And also working hand in hand with me are the uh RRRthe school council That means the students have got their leaders uh Formerly I mentioned  about> people like <O/> leaders but other than those leaders from each dormitory which are equivalent to <O/> leaders in our government set-up we have representatives from classes uh we have different we call them ministers or counsellors in different departments uh so whenever there is a problem from any faculty or any aspect uh these counsellors or these ministers they are the first to hear those problems and they might forward that problem to me and I might act according to the IIIappropriatenet appropriateness of how to solve that problem In short that is what is all about my duties 
<$A> After knowing how the gap between the two sides of the centre narrows through the good offices of the warden another important link in the operations of the centre is academic work Despite the fact that the RMA training centre employs scores of teachers I've picked one on behalf of the others He is <ea/>Ndugu <name/> who teaches simple science subjects to first-year students <ea/>Ndugu <name/> is also a laboratory technician with a diploma in biochemistry Well how does he execute his several duties Listen to him narrating his story 
<$E> Uh as a tutor in this school with my qualification being a medical laboratory <.>technician technician teaching simple science clinical IIIpath and clinical pathology and as simple science I'm teaching them general biology chemistry and physics This subject usually helps the student BBBhelps theRRR student to cope with the real medical uh RRRmedical subjects So long as our students are being picked let's say from IIIle uh the majority of them are primary school leavers Usually they have got uh very little knowledge BBBvery little knowledgeRRR of science so in order for in order that they may they can cope with these subjects we have to teach them uh simple science And apart from teaching simple science that is I'm teaching clinical pathology This  subjects> subject> usually helps the student to make a RRRa RRRa diagnosis make a clinical diagnosis and uh it is this subject which usually uh uh helps the student to do with our work I mean after BBBI mean afterRRR qualifying this subject of clinical pathology helps the student to perform their job perfectly Apart from teaching in this school I'm also I've been also RRRbeen assigned other duties at the regional hospital As a medical laboratory technician with a diploma in clinical chemistry I'm doing most of the IIIclinic BBBmost ofRRR the clinical chemistry investigation at the regional hospital 
<$A> Despite teaching there are various issues which face the students in their daily undertakings A situation which requires some kind of co-ordination and organisation and cater for their interests 
S1BINT3T
<$A> During the workshop a number of papers were presented concerning sustainable usage of pesticides in Tanzania One of the papers was on pesticides registration and control in Tanzania presented by Florence Simununa scientist with the Tropical Pesticides Research Institute TPRI In the following interview Florence Simununa explains the importance of having pesticides' registration and control in Tanzania and how the institute helps farmers on safe use of pesticides First she outlines the activities of TPRI 
<$B> Uh the main activities of Tropical Pesticides Research Institute that is TPRI uh is doing research on pesticides which are geared towards controlling economic importance first in Tanzania as well as rendering technical services related to pesticides' registration and control and in addition to that uh uh rendering services related to safe and efficient use of pesticides in Tanzania 
<$A> Uh one of the main activities of TPRI is to render registration and control Tell us what is the importance of having pesticides' registration and control 
<$B> Yeah The importance of having pesticides' registration and control in Tanzania is to reduce risks of pesticides used for man and its environment 
<$A> What is the main purpose of pesticide registration 
<$B> Yeah The main purpose of pesticides' registration is to ensure that pesticides should be used according to its direction uh warnings and the precaution without causing or posing any hazards to man and his environment or non-target organisms 
<$A> Now tell us the RRRthe procedures for registration of pesticides 
<$B> Uh The main procedures for pesticides' registration are as follows uh Number one a registrant should fill in UUUPRC one form which is application for pesticides' IIIregis registration uh This form is available for IIIu fifty US dollar or equivalent Tanzanian shillings Number two a registrant should submit three copies of registration <O/> with the data and technical information of the product to be registered Number three a registrant should submit a representative sample of pesticides for laboratory and field tests and uh number five A registrant  need><+_needs> to pay five hundred US dollar or equivalent Tanzanian shillings as registration fee for experimental  purpose><+_purposes> Number six uh Registrants should pay five thousand US dollar as field testing fee and number seven uh a field report uh must be produced by a research scientist and uh this report should be uh approved by uh PARTC that is Pesticides' Approval uh Registration uh Technical Committee and TPRI Council and lastly the pesticides uh can be registered uh under provisional registration and later on the product uh can be up-graded to full registration 
<$A> Can you also tell us the registration status and the registration fees in the country 
<$B> Yeah uh There are four categories of pesticides' registration in the country uh Number one there is uh experimental registration uh Experimental registration are products for experimental purpose only which they are registered for laboratory or field tests only uh They are not meant for public use That is they cannot be sold imported manufactured formulated or used in Tanzania and uh its uh fee is five hundred US dollar or equivalent Tanzanian IIIshilling shillings uh The fee for experimental registration is renewable  for> every year and secondly uh the second status of uh pesticides' registration is provisional registration uh Provisional registration are products which uh are approved for general use uh for a maximum of uh for a maximum period of two years Its fee is one thousand five hundred US dollar or equivalent Tanzanian shillings uh Number three is uh restricted IIIregis registration uh These are pesticides uh registered for specific target pests but uh not for general public use uh Its fee is one thousand US dollar or equivalent Tanzanian  shilling><+_shillings> The fee is renewable for two years and lastly uh there is full registration uh Full registration are products which uh have been provisionally registered and have been in use for at least three years and are up-graded to full registration  purpose><+_purposes> Products in this category can be imported manufactured formulated sold and used in Tanzania Its fee is five thousand US dollar or equivalent Tanzanian  shilling><+_shillings>
<$B> I'm sure the registration process  have><+_has> some procedures for one to acquire a permit Now tell us how do you do
<$A> Yeah First of all uh when you speak about  permit><+_permits> there are different types of permit uh Number one there's permit to import pesticides in the country In order to acquire such a permit first of all the type of pesticides which uh you are importing should fall under IIIprovis provisional registration restricted registration or full registration All products under this registration can be imported sold manufactured formulated or used uh in Tanzania And secondly uh you need to buy BBByou need to buyRRR and fill in UUUPRC two form which is application to import a pesticide The form is available for twenty US dollar or equivalent Tanzanian shillings Then uh the importer have to pay a zero point five per cent fee import price That is import sales fee and after paying such a fee uh the permit uh to import a pesticide that is <name/> three uh is later issued In addition to that also on arrival of the imported pesticides our TPRI staff should conduct routine inspection and take samples for analysis depending on the type of packaging and formulation Other permits uh  includes><+_include> pesticides' business permit uh Number one there is pest controllers uh I mean including fumigation If a person wants to be a fumigator she or he has to fill in uh form UUUPRC eight That is application for a permit to carry out fumigation and other pest control activities uh The form uh costs two twenty US dollar or equivalent Tanzanian shillings and number two a person should fill uh form UUUPRC four That is application for clearing certificate of using or altering the registered pesticides for commercial purposes uh The form costs twenty US dollar and afterwards inspection should be conducted on the following issues uh Inspection should be conducted uh on the premises uh  equipments><+_equipment> protective gear uh chemicals and uh staff Then according to inspection report a registrar could either issue a permit or not And number two uh a permit to carry out uh to sell pesticides that is uh retailers A person should fill in form UUUPRC nine That is application for a permit to deal with pesticides on retail uh basis The form is issued free of charge and secondly a person has to fill in form UUUPRC four That is application of clearance certificate of using or altering a registered  pesticide><+_pesticides> for commercial purposes uh The form costs US dollar twenty or equivalent Tanzanian shillings Then inspection of uh premises  equipments><+_equipment> protective gear chemicals and staff should be conducted and a permit is issued according to inspection report by a registrar and lastly there's a permit to manufacture or formulate pesticides uh A person uh  need><+_needs> to fill in form UUUPRC ten That is application for a permit to formulate or manufacture a pesticide uh This form is issued free of charge and later on inspection  on><+_of> the uh RRRon premises  equipments><+_equipment> protective gear laboratory chemicals and the staff uh should be conducted and uh according to inspection report uh a scheme is either granted or not The scheme could not be granted a permit 
<$B> Do you have specific qualifications for one to acquire a permit
<$A> Yeah I mean a person should meet the required standards in order to uh acquire a permit 
<$B> The other objective of the Tropical Pesticides Research Institute is to carry out research on pesticides and I know most of those who are using pesticides are in the rural areas I mean the farmers Now how do you communicate with them 
<$B> Yeah uh We communicate with target group that is farmers uh through conducting seminars on the safe and  efficience><+_efficient> use of pesticides uh to farmers and secondly uh we conduct uh pest management  course><+_courses> uh to pesticides' dealers on the pesticides' registration use uh and control of pesticides at TPRI uh We therefore expect uh when such people go to their respective places they'll be able to disseminate uh such knowledge and information they gathered at TPRI uh to farmers and thirdly uh TPRI has prepared a programme to explain to public its activities uh including the safe and  efficience><+_efficient> use of pesticides in Tanzania We therefore expect to broadcast uh this programme very soon uh in Radio Tanzania so that especially farmers will understand what uh we are doing at TPRI and lastly uh we disseminate such information through research findings Findings uh are published uh in various papers which uh such information could be easily disseminated by uh say extension officers uh to the farmers in the rural areas 
<$B> Let us now go back to the registration process I would like you to give us more elaboration on how you make a follow-up to ensure that the registered pesticide which is intended for public use is the one which is imported 
<$A> On the  arrive><+_arrival> of uh imported pesticides uh TPRI staff uh usually conduct inspection and take samples say three to five for every twenty uh kilogram or twenty thousand uh litres depending on the type of packing and formulation uh The main purpose of taking samples is to perform analysis in order to verify quality of the pesticides being imported in the country 
<$B> We have been talking about the TPRI and the farmer but what is the main relationship between uh TPRI and the farmer because TPRI is making a research on pesticides and the farmer is just a person who is cultivating the land Now what is the main relationship 
<$B> uh What Tropical Pesticides Research Institute that is TPRI doing uh We are conducting research on different pesticides against uh economic pests uh The findings uh which we get through research findings uh are used as a guideline to the farmers and actually uh the findings  indicates><+_indicate> which type of pesticides could be used to bring  a> significant or positive results against economic pests which we believe uh through such information the farmer can be uh can get an advantage
<$B> Some pesticides UUUflourines like sulphur which is mostly used by cashnut growers are said to have acid which is harmful  for><+_to> the land What is your advice to the farmers Should they continue using it 
<$A> uh Yeah There are various reasons which can cause uh a pesticide to be harmful uh and one of <->it><+_them> uh for example if a pesticide is not used according to its direction We therefore expect that uh such kind of pesticides could bring harmful effects to uh the person who is using it and its environment Therefore before making any conclusion we need to make investigation whether what the farmer farmers uh uh the farmer's complaining is true uh In this way we will be in a better position to advise farmers Meanwhile farmers should seek advice through their relevant agricultural officers that is at regional and the district level uh in their respective regions 
<$B> uh Some people are complaining that pesticides affect the health of the farmers but whether we like it or not the pesticides will continue to be imported for public use Now what are your comments to RRRto the clients 
<$A>Yeah You mean uh the advice to farmers on the safe use of pesticides in Tanzania 
<$B> Of course 
<$A> uh Okay farmers should be educated on different issues uh related to safe and efficience efficient use of pesticides in Tanzania through uh radio programmes As I have said before that TPRI uh uh has prepared a programme to explain to the public uh the kind of activities which occurred at TPRI and uh we expect that uh most farmers uh will get uh useful information and secondly uh such information could be disseminated to farmers through TV For those who have TV and magazine seminars and uh conducting different courses As I have said before at TPRI uh we are conducting a pesticide a pest management course uh which was started in nineteen ninety-three The main purpose of uh this course is uh to inform pesticides' dealers uh on the safe and efficient use of pesticides uh in Tanzania and as I have mentioned before we expect that because pesticides' dealers they usually uh have  a> contact with farmers through selling of their products sometimes in the rural area So we expect that they will be able to uh disseminate such information to farmers The things which they have learned from TPRI uh they'll be able to uh disseminate to farmers uh in the rural areas And lastly I would like to say that the farmers should always seek advice uh  to><+_from> experts or people who will assist them on the safe and efficient use of pesticides in Tanzania And also I would like BBBI would like RRRalso to encourage farmers to use uh integrated pest management uh You see you cannot only depend on uh using pesticides to control uh pests uh Farmers should also use other uh ways of controlling pests such as IIIbiolo biological means physical means and etcetera

<$A> We present Women's Half Hour Welcome once again to another edition of Women's Half Hour Today we bring you an interview with <ea/>Ndugu Chito Ram chairperson of the national committee on traditional practices affecting the health of women and children about female genital mutilation Female genital mutilation is one of the traditional practices which is said to affect the health of women and children Female genital mutilation is still practised in most African countries including Tanzania In this programme today are interviewed <ea/>Ndugu Chito Ram chairperson of the national committee on traditional practices affecting the health of women and children <ea/>Ndugu Chito will talk about among other issues measures taken by the committee to eliminate female genital mutilation the recommendations made for female genital mutilation to enrich the African platform for action at the Dakar conference and how female genital mutilation affects a woman in terms of her welfare and development She begins by telling us how is the situation in Tanzania so far as regards female genital mutilation 
<$B> The situation of female genital mutilation in Tanzania uh is a bit bright in the sense that we have started to embark on the campaign against female genital mutilation in one region that is Dodoma region and in Tanzania out of the twenty-five regions twenty uh seven regions out of twenty mainland practise female genital mutilation This equals to thirty-three point three per cent of the population so the situation we will call it bad but not grave and uh fortunately we have received some funds from IWDA that is International Women Development Agency from Australia and we have started on the sensitisation project against female genital mutilation in Dodoma region which so far from last year nineteen ninety-four the situation appears to be very encouraging in a sense that out of the four  district><+_districts> in Dodoma we have reached in those four districts forty villages that is ten  village><+_villages> in each district and then we have sensitised whom we call our focus group  discussant><+_discussants> or  facilitator><+_facilitators> and we have conducted seminars  to><+_for> them and in the grassroot level so these people in return are sensitising their fellow villagers on the adverse effect of uh female genital mutilation uh As you are aware I'm we are calling it FGM because it's not circumcision A woman has not no organ to be circumcised except she's being mutilated 
<$A> uh <ea/>Mama Chito you  was><+_were> one among the participants at the Dakar conference and the FGM was one of the key issues which was discussed at length What can you say about the discussion Has it shown that FGM in Tanzania is a big problem compared to other African countries 
<$B> uh other African countries or you will find the whole population of that country is practising FGM So in Tanzania it's seven regions out of twenty so that is not a very bad situation indeed and uh in Tanzania they wait until the girl is about ten years old or after they have started their menstrual period whereas other countries in West Africa they mutilate a baby a child when they are just one year old or two years old and that is most cruel It is cruel even to do it on a twelve-year-old child but it is worse when you do it on one and a half year child So our situation is not as bad as in other parts of Africa 
<$A> The problem is now on the increase and of course it needs immediate action to stop it So what IIIrec recommendations have you made to enrich the African platform for action which will be discussed in Beijing 
<$B> In Dakar we strongly uh condemned and recommended this horrendous and cruel practice should stop as the government leaders or heads of state have IIIadher uh they should adhere to the convention of the right of the child and to the convention of uh human rights so as they have signed all those  convention><+_conventions> they should adhere to those  convention><+_conventions> and institute laws to prohibit this BBBto prohibit thisRRR practice and also for those who violate this human IIIrig basic human right they should be punished severely We said this practice is very dehumanising to women and when you dehumanise a person they feel they are worthless human beings or creatures they feel they have no use or purpose in this world therefore their role is to remain inferior so this we condemned in Dakar very much and we forwarded our areas of concern to be discussed at the Beijing meeting in September this year 
<$A> The fifth African regional conference on women held in Dakar Senegal in the mid of November last year revealed that some women in the West African states Sierra Leone in particular have now made female genital mutilation  as> a project to earn their daily bread What are <ea/>Ndugu Chito's opinions on this 
<$B> Well it is true in Tanzania also It is true in Tanzania also because those people who practise or who are the perpetrators of this FGM practice they get a lot of money for doing one FGM For example in one village we were told the person gets up to ten thousand shillings for doing FGM on one child On top of that they will get a cow or a goat or chicken and many other  present><+_presents> flour maize flour or a sack of maize etcetera etcetera You name it they get it They're the most well-fed well-dressed and to them this is an  economical><+_economic> trade or  economical><+_economic> venture So uh in our groups of  facilitator><+_facilitators> one was FGM practitioner and she said now you people are going to make me very poor because I have got to lay down the tool and actually this lady her name is <name/> and she is in <name/> village in Dodoma she was very open about it very positive about it She said I was doing it to other people's children but I didn't do it to my own children Neither will I ever do it to my own children but now she has vowed to work hand in hand with our national committee on traditional practice to work  against><+_towards> abolishing this terrible practice of mutilating young female girls 
<$A> Okay coming back to the African platform for action Now how the national committee on harmful practices will implement what you have recommended on the African platform for action before the Beijing conference 
<$B> Yes another recommendation at Dakar was that every government should be asked to institute or enact a law to prohibit this practice so one way which we are going to work through is the Ministry of Health Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare and Youth and Ministry of Community Development Women and Children's  Affair><+_Affairs> including Ministry of Justice so that uh we can be instrumental in bringing this change in those harmful traditional practice because this is one of those harmful practices which needs to be abolished but we will preserve the beneficial traditional practices 
<$A> You have started with Dodoma alone Now what are your strategies to enable your service to or to extend your service to other centres the other seven regions 
<$B> Our next strategy is to proceed to Singida region which also out of the three districts two  district><+_districts> practise this harmful practice of uh FGM namely Manyoni district including Itigi and all the suburbs around it Singida urban and Singida IIIrur rural It's only Iramba district which does not practise FGM So this is our next target 
<$A> I understand earlier you told us some of the measures which have been taken by the committee to eliminate the practice Has it been successful  to><+_in> those areas you introduced the project 
<$B> Yes we have made follow-up in all those villages where we RRRwe RRRwe spotted the facilitators and whom we RRRwe gave them orientation  seminar><+_seminars> by uh conducting role plays and community involvement So we made a follow up and by asking first the community themselves whether these facilitators after their seminars they have done any job and even from a small child we were told the facilitator has been very busy conducting meetings and condemning FGM practice So we feel that they are doing a very good job of advocacy for us and very good campaign against FGM in their area and also we went to the community and asked this season has there been any circumcised child or circumcision ceremony which accompany this FGM practice They were all very scared and they  say><+_said> no because this facilitator is very aggressive and the village leadership or government of the village is very very strict If any parent is caught then they are taken to the local gathering there and they are either fined or they are even taken to the district courts So we feel that uh something is really being done not just through words but through deeds as well and it is through collaboration of the whole village leadership as well as district leadership 
<$A> And now tell us in brief how FGM affects a woman in terms of her welfare and development as well 
<$B> First of all there are uh immediate effects Then there are mid-term effects Then there are long-term effects The immediate effects is profuse haemorrhage or excessive bleeding at the time when the cut is made to circumcise her or to mutilate her external genitalia By external genitalia what is being circumcised is the whole clitoris and the two labia minora so the girl can bleed profusely even she can faint or death could occur immediately and then oedema of the whole circumcised or excised area until it obscures her RRRher ability to urinate or to pass urine and then the bladder gets extended or distended and then she can't urinate then she gets infected and after that she can get very high fever etcetera Then mid-term effect is from that scarring tissue which RRRwhich heals now there's a big fibrous or a big celloid A big celloid is a big scar like potato which forms on the genitalia and then it again obscures even her menstrual flow her urination and uh when she grows up even coitus with the spouse or the husband will be very painful and very difficult for her Now the long-term effect when she now  conceive><+_conceives> during labour this scarring tissue will be so hard and it won't give way by stretching as RRRas the vulva does uh under normal circumstances during labour so the baby's head is delayed to be delivered and she keeps on pushing she gets herself exhausted until she may have a very bad uh vaginal and UUUperennial tear which can extend up to the anus and then cause many many other  manifestation><+_manifestations> like uh what we call <O/> vaginal fistula or recto-vaginal fistula whereby the RRRthe tear has extended from vagina urinary tract up to the anal tract so the urine and faeces will be mixing together and this is a very very painful and traamatic experience both physically and mentally and the healing also is very painful because they may have to undergo operations about two operations or three operations in order to RRRto cure this condition completely or sometimes they never get uh cured completely So here the mother is affected and the unborn baby is also affected The baby may get brain damage By getting the brain damage the baby will be born mentally retarded or even get a dead baby So the baby can be still-born as we call it or a dead baby on hand so these are all disastrous to the mother 
<$A> uh some people say that the female genital mutilation can also lead to divorce Is that not a loss on part of a life 
<$B> Well it is because when one gets married the objective is to lead a happy normal everlasting life not to end in uh divorce or disaster like that So it is very traumatic psychologically socially sexually and uh from any aspect of uh one's normal life it is disastrous 
<$A> uh <ea/>Mama Chito I'm also interested to know how you approach the women the <ea/>njakangas those old <ea/>bibis who are supposed to RRRto mutilate our young girls I think it is difficult to convince them to stop the practice isn't it 
S1BINT5T
<$A> In this week's programme we carry an interview with Mr Ladislaus Salema the general manager of the National Engineering Company NECO and also President of the Institution of Engineers in Tanzania In this conversation with Radio Tanzania's Eda Sanga Mr Salema dwells on a wide range of activities related to the National Engineering Company the engineering profession in Tanzania and its contribution to the national economy
<$B> uh The National Engineering Company sometimes referred as NECO was established in July nineteen sixty-seven uh as a result of nationalisation of a business formerly owned by a Dutch company known shortly as TOM Now TOM owned a machine shop and a foundry and TOM was engaged basically in uh repair of uh various pieces of equipment from the industrial sector mostly from the sisal industries So after nationalisation in nineteen sixty-nine the TOM business was also amalgamated with <name/> who was basically engaged in steel construction So the National Engineering Company of today has uh three main activities It has a steel fabrication and erection section a machine shop and a foundry Now in the steel fabrication we are mostly engaged in the production of uh fuel storage tanks building of depots construction of steel bridges trusses grain girders and various other steel fabrications In the machine shop we are involved with machining various components for industrial spare parts and some components that are required in our own constructions particularly of uh the fuel storage facilities We are able to produce cast iron castings steel castings and <O/> castings Now we produce parts that are required in the industry as spare parts but sometimes as components for assembly of new products and we undertake repair services uh parts that are required to be reconditioned particularly for motor vehicles in our machine shop So in short those are many areas of our <O/> and as to how relevant they are to the country economy I don't need to emphasise that fuel storage and distribution is very very important to the functioning of our economy and the NECO is the biggest key-player in Tanzania in as far as construction and storage facilities are concerned And we do produce spare parts for instance for a ginnery which are used for the ginning of cotton We do produce spare parts for the sugar mills We do produce components sometimes even for the breweries
<$C> Taking into account that this company started immediately after the nationalisation process in nineteen sixty-seven and looking at where we are now uh would you say the company is operating to its set aims and objectives
<$B> uh After nationalisation what was inherited was basically all the pieces of equipment and there has been rehabilitation particularly in nineteen seventy-nine and eighty-two period in the steel shops and in the foundry and the capacity of steel fabrication was then raised considerably so that to date we are able to fabricate on a single-shift basis up to one thousand two hundred pounds a year Our fabricators of steel And with the recent investment on the induction furnace we can comfortably produce about a thousand pounds of castings a year Now this RRRthis makes NECO foundry one of the biggest This makes our steel fabrication section one of the biggest in the country And uh there has been a gradual replacement of some pieces of equipment also in the machine shop but we still are really short of the IIIman many equipment that we require to be more competitive particularly in the now unfolding market situation particularly in the machining area But we are confident that we will be able to uh make these investments in the future and we are confident that we shall be able to grow We have been operating on profit since nineteen seventy-six to date and we have been in the competitive market <O/> another time when Tanzania was only planned economy we were competing with even external firms so we are confident that the National Engineering Company should be able to survive We are also looking ahead towards maybe some kind of co-operation with people or firms with higher technology levels so that we can move in new products
<$C> Would you know how big your staff is and how much is local and how much is uh maybe foreign
<$B> Well we are about three hundred and fifty people uh with about twenty-four engineers and uh we are all local all Tanzanians We've had  an> assistance from Germany since nineteen seventy-five to nineteen ninety We have had uh this assistance starting with eleven expatriates in IIIvari various areas of engineering and management uh reduced gradually to about three in nineteen ninety and then it UUUphased out completely So now we are hundred per cent local and we are managing
<$C> Do you have a working relationship with the Engineering Faculty of the University of Dar es Salaam
<$B> Yes yes we work BBBwe workRRR quite closely with the Engineering Faculty in the sense that we do send our people to consult the experts there sometimes We also have a kind of programme going on with experts in production particularly of castings in the foundry who come to advise us on how to improve our quality and on personal basis we know most of the professors and senior lecturers in the university so we have this kind of interaction uh even on <+_a> personal basis
<$C> Since you are the biggest in the country and in your capacity as President of the Institution of Engineers in Tanzania there has been of late some discontentment on the part of the public on the performance of engineers in Tanzania Would you have any comment
<$B> uh I RRRI would BBBI would sayRRR BBBI wouldRRR say the public is justified to be to feel concerned BBBto feel concernedRRR  of><+_about> the performance of the engineers in the country but I would hasten to add that the public has not been fully informed and we are trying now in our BBBin ourRRR engineering promotion activities to get the public informed of the role of engineers in Tanzania uh what they have done and what is happening because basically the discontent you might be now hearing about is uh on the road construction and uh most of it most of this is not really done by local engineers Most of this is done by foreign firms or locally registered firms but which are not really local in nature And we have also discussed this as an institution with the Minister of Works for instance trying to see how we can IIIup upgrade the locally registered contractors for instance so that they can improve their performance to avoid this uh discontent from the public which in my opinion is quite fair The public has a right to RRRto RRRto demand to get uh BBBto getRRR the service that they are really paying for
<$C Would you say you're facing problems of maintaining the engineers that you have you trained you know those who go for greener pastures elsewhere
<$B> Well occasionally RRRoccasionally we will have somebody wanting to change a job basically because of better  remunerations><+_remuneration> elsewhere uh but I would say the situation in the national engineering is stable uh because RRRbecause I think there is more job content more engineering in NECO and it's more satisfying too if one is really intending to develop a career in engineering it's more satisfying to work uh for an engineering firm for an engineer instead of just running out to some people who might pay you better but not give you very very good challenging jobs But on the whole engineers in this country are not as well paid as they should be In fact I should say they are BBBthey areRRR not even considered along with other professionals Well I don't want to complain about doctors getting better pay than engineers but I thought when the government was considering professionals like doctors they should IIIre actually think of engineers because no other profession and I repeat no other profession can operate without engineers
<$B> In terms of uh spare parts uh Mr Salema how did you come to innovate the department of making of spare parts so that the country at one point is self-sustaining instead of using foreign exchange to import these spare parts
<$C> Now spare part production spare part production or component production I would say isn't very very old thing in the country and many many companies have started by A getting a component a broken component or one-out component and trying to copy it and then produce one and try to fit it and this has been quite difficult In fact it is the wrong way of doing it The right way of doing it would be to get a drawing an engineering drawing from the designer with all the specifications including material specification and then produce according to the specifications That way is a RRRa better way a surer way of making sure that you produce the right part But you see as you know most of the equipment in this country is very old and even when it's new drawings are not normally made available We import a lot of machines to this country but nobody has ever demanded that as part of the supply contract drawings should be supplied for spare parts So people have been importing equipment and the only thing they have managed to have is a manual for parts so they BBBso theyRRR could continue to order Now we have international company attempted to make spare parts using <O/> metals copying the sample where when they are available using the drawings or where a new sample is available taking the new sample for user drawing and use the drawing BBBand use the drawing>-/> for producing the parts and sometimes even reuse the drawing on a repetitive order But I must BBBI mustRRR say that uh the country as a whole the production of components of spare parts is still a long long way towards fulfilling the demand for there isn't that information of the spares that are required It's simply not available People talk about we need spare parts but if you ask them do you have the drawing which are the spare parts you want what are the material specifications they wouldn't know they wouldn't know so it's quite difficult it's quite difficult to really go fully into the import substitution for spare parts in the country in the near future 
<$C> uh Talking about these components and spare parts how is the market system because uh one of the complaint has always been that when you buy a locally made component or spare part it is sometimes more expensive than the one that has been imported from abroad
<$B> It RRRit could actually be true but it could also be untrue A bit true because if you are ordering a casting and you only want one piece or two pieces the cost of producing these two pieces is certainly going to be very high because the process is the same as if you order a thousand pieces So because you have to make a pattern you have to make a mould uh you'll have to make a drawing maybe the process is the same for one part as it is for one thousand parts So if you had large quantities the price is going to be low and uh if we had if a certain optimum quantity is ordered the prices local prices are usually very low in comparison with imports uh On the question of quality it could also be true but it could also be untrue If RRRif the order did specify the specifications were given on the material and the dimensions were correctly given I see no problem in one producing  casting><+_castings> particularly the simple  casting><+_castings> like cast iron or steel castings to the required specification and dimensions uh the <->the I'm saying I've started by saying it could be true and it could be untrue It could be untrue in the sense that people get used to importing spare parts People have been importing spare parts since the beginning of time in this country and people are reluctant to change People won't accept this change So people would still want to go back to their old suppliers The suppliers who have been selling are pressurising to sell so it's easy to jump by and say look we don't want the spare parts because they are poor quality and we should import but a number of  profession><+_professions> we have established that local some local spare parts are even of higher quality than some imported spare parts
S1BINT6T
<$A> This is Face the Mike and welcome to the programme Many people including Tanzanians are perhaps unfamiliar with Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology a public organ which was established by the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology Act Number Seven of nineteen eighty-six Formally known as the Tanzania National Scientific Research Council this parastatal organisation effectively and efficiently co-ordinates and promotes scientific research and technology development in Tanzania and also acts as chief advisor to government on science and technology policy and on all matters pertaining to the development of science and technology in their application to social economic development in the country With this background in mind why a commission for science and technology Why is this discipline key to the development of any nation These are but a few of the many questions I asked the Director General of Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology Professor Abdul Rachman Salim Msangi But first why is science and technology so important in the development of mankind
<$B> The wealth and the development of a nation is much more dependent on the level and application of science and technology in that country and that is why today we find that the rich and developed countries of the world are not those with rich natural resources but those with a very high level of science and technology development A typical example is uh if we compare say our country Tanzania and Japan From the natural resources point of view Tanzania is very much richer than Japan in almost all aspects of natural resources agricultural and mineral uh water resources and so on but it's everybody's knowledge that Japan is a much more developed country today than Tanzania and the simple reason is that IIIJapane Japan is very much more advanced scientifically and technologically than Tanzania
<$A> Then what efforts has Tanzania done in ensuring that science and technology receives the attention it deserves Do you think that these efforts are adequate If not what do you think should be done to improve the situation
<$B> Well Tanzania uh compared to other III develop developing countries in Africa I think can be said to be putting a reasonable effort in the development and application of science and technology as an important means for socio-economic development Uh I wouldn't say that the effort is adequate because we are very far behind when we are compared to well other newly developed countries or countries which are generally grouped as developing like ourselves uh like Korea uh India and such like countries South American  country><+_countries> like Brazil These are grouped with us as developing countries but they're far more advanced than us because their science and technology capability is more advanced than ours uh The uh awareness of the importance of science and technology uh as a means for socio-economic development in Tanzania uh began only about uh two decades ago The both the Organisation of African Unity OAU and also the United Nations in various fora during the past two decades have been emphasising the need for countries to devote a reasonable amount of their financial resources towards the development of science and technology in the form of science and technology education in the form of scientific and technological uh research institutions and also in the application of scientific research to economic development activities Uh currently Tanzania is spending just about zero point five per cent of its gross  natural><+_national> product  towards><+_on> the development of science and technology and this is far less than was recommended a decade ago in nineteen-eighty by the Lagos plan of action which uh agreed that member countries of the OAU should as soon as possible provide for at least one per cent of the GNP towards the development of science and technology and Tanzania was a signatory to this agreement So the pith of it is that more than a decade later well we still haven't achieved even half of that target So this is the situation at present Tanzania amongst other developing countries of Sub-Saharan Africa is still lagging far behind the IIIdecad the RRRthe RRRthe target that was recommended by the Organisation of African Unity and by the United Nations uh Conference on Science and Technology for Development
<$A> And uh what is the problem apart from the fact that we don't have the resources What other problems are there
<$B> Well the other IIIpro uh resources themselves in the way of say finance is not adequate You have to have uh adequate IIIman scientific and technological manpower and this manpower can only be generated from university institutions and the university institutions are supported by the school uh uh the RRRthe school programmes so that uh a balanced science and technology development in the country requires first that we have you have good a very good school system right from the primary through the secondary to the tertiary level so that your scientific manpower very strong background in science and technology. Now in almost all these levels we need to pull up our socks very much Uh at present time we have something like I think a hundred fifty to two hundred scientists and technologists per one million of the population and the target set by the United Nations is that you can only have meaningful science and technology development in the country if you have something like two hundred thousand scientists and technologists to one million of the population So we have a very long way to go
<$A> Would that be the reason maybe why the government at last in the nineteen nineties has decided to amalgamate higher education with science and technology
<$B> Yes I think this is one of the main reasons uh The creation of a Ministry of Science Technology and Higher Education is in fact a response  to><+_of> government  of><+_to> a recommendation that was made by the Tanzania scientific and technological uh community in a national workshop that was held in Arusha in eighteen in nineteen eighty-five which recommended among other things that in order to enhance the development and application of science and technology in the country it was necessary even though the workshop realised at that time that uh the country was facing several uh problems economic development problems but still thought that science and technology was so vital was such a vital factor a vital stimulus in the development of science and technology that uh even though the situation was not so favourable in the country it was necessary for such a ministry to be created So the Tanzania science and technology uh community are very grateful very appreciative to government that at last it has heeded to this uh recommendation
<$A> Normally as a rule uh science subjects in schools maybe beginning from secondary level up to higher level is considered to be a dull subject is considered to be difficult and people many people actually students don't want to associate themselves with the subject As a result maybe uh we've performed poorly in this area Is there a way that uh the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology could come up with innovative ways of teaching this subject so that it is interesting and attracts more students
<$B> Yes as a matter of fact we are already doing something in that direction in that we uh sponsor uh school science competitions through the Tanzania uh Science Teachers Association They hold uh exhibitions annually for secondary schools whereby the secondary school students uh display their capability in uh scientific subjects uh all scientific subjects biology chemistry physics mathematics uh and we help them in giving prizes to the winners This has been a very great stimulus to the uh IIIcult uh developing of interest in science uh in IIIsecond RRRin secondary schools uh Recently also we've been uh co-operating with uh uh what they call science camps This is an activity that was recently developed by the University of Dar es Salaam whereby they go out into the country and hold camps for primary schools secondary schools whereby they do various scientific activities uh it could be collecting materials from the environment from the land from the sea and examining these under the microscopes and trying to relate how these organisms that they've collected uh grw and how they are adapted to the environment from which they were collected
<$A> Now I also understand that uh our country has already evolved a national science and technology policy Could you elaborate and highlight on this policy
<$B> Yeah uh the science and technology policy I think was uh passed in nineteen uh IIIwork worked out in nineteen eighty-five and was uh uh incorporated into the national economic development policy in the following year With the RRRthe uh RRRthe policy simply says that in view of the fact that socio-economic development is dependent on the application of science and technology that all uh national economic development plans should include a chapter on science and technology as a support base Uh if we take for example the uh policy on agricultural development then we all know that in so far as the current national economic development plan is concerned agriculture is given the highest priority I think rightly so It allocates I think thirty per cent of the GNP and uh the IIIsci we uh the scientific and economical community of the country are saying in order to make that policy meaningful we must also say that the bulk of science and technology research and development effort should be equally uh biased That is to say the bulk of it the bulk of research and development activities should also go the lion share should go to agricultural production Uh that is to say research aimed at enhancing agricultural production Industry and energy I think is the next one and uh twenty per cent or so and we are saying the same that that is to say that the national economic development plan should be parallel to the national science and technology policy
<$A> Now as a nation I'm sure you'll agree with me Professor Msangi that uh we don't have a culture such that uh takes us uh to be in harmony with science and technology Now as the Director General of the institution that has been charged with the responsibility of promoting science and technology in the country and facilitating the evolution of a science and technology culture in the general public can you explain how you're going to carry out these functions
B: Well first of all uh the development uh of RRRof science and technology the in the uh national institutions like I said before we try to influence the science and technology activities in schools uh in universities we as I said RRRwe helped finance science uh and technology shows for schools or science camps uh uh In the uh general population we have as one of those activities that are aimed to encourage and help to develop a science and technology culture in the general population we annually uh try to identify amongst the  Tanzania><+_Tanzanian> population at all levels people who have indicated uh that they have a capability in science and technology uh It might be ordinary people who RRRwho RRR whohave who are innovative who have devised uh mechanisms of or RRRor RRRor devices appliances for easing say human labour uh appliances for replacing imported uh products and when we recognise such talents we encourage them to develop by uh providing a reward to the innovators So we give what uh RRRwhat we call uh IIITa Tanzania Award for Scientific and Technological Achievement If we can uh BBBwe canRRR BBBwe canRRR uh if we get a person in RRRin even uh a lay person who has made some uh appreciable innovation we recommend these people for the award and this award is given uh on May Day the first of May each year by the President of the United Republic and this is how we encourage uh the development of science and technology culture in the community
<$A> Uh but there are some people again from the public who complain that uh awards to these uh people who have made some innovations simply end up as awards You don't hear a much about them later on as a way of follow-up whether they've done something more uh I mean some advancement to where they were uh whether whatever technology they have put  in><+_on> the market is appropriate whether they are finding any problems as far as marketing is concerned whether information is trickling down to the people who need that technology What do you have to say about this
<$B> Well it's not very easy it's not so easy for a theoretical model to be put into practice It takes time but we're doing something about that uh
S1BINT7T
<$A> This is Face the Mike and facing the mike today is Professor L K Shayo International Village for Science and Technology Project Co-ordinator Perhaps to begin our discussion Professor you could tell us why International Village for Science and Technology in this country
<$B> Well uh I think this village has come about as a result of our experiences over several years uh and especially our experiences uh in the in our participation uh in the activities of the International IIIvil International Centre for Theoretical Physics which is in Triest Uh we have proved beyond doubt that uh when a scientist or a technologist or in fact any thinker gets a place where he or she can concentrate the results of such concentration are really very encouraging uh Our experiences show that whereas for example we have been teaching in the University of Dar es Salaam for uh a long time and even if you take the IIIexp RRRthe uh experiences of other scientists who've been teaching in African universities you find that a lot of the work they have done in research a RRRlok of a lot of the breakthroughs have been done outside in an environment which is conducive to discovery and innovation And the idea of creating this village is precisely to IIIcu to provide such an environment to our scientists and technologists
<$A> Perhaps you could uh give us some more insights as to what is the environment like
<$B> Uh maybe very briefly the village is uh one could imagine a village to be uh a botanical garden a very large botanical garden Inside of that garden will be various institutions Uh there will be two types of institutions one is a tiny wing of the village which will be composed of uh schools uh for talented children and innovators Then there'll be the research's wing which will be uh aimed at those people who have already completed their training and they are uh maybe doing they're working in various institutions like the universities or research institutions and they will be coming to the village to do research in the various research centres Uh there will be research centres in all disciplines of science and technology uh maybe not a <O/> as I've said uh I could mention just a few There will be an international uh centre for physics chemistry biology biotechnology uh an international centre for science equipment There will be an international centre for A-sciences and uh for mathematical sciences Uh these are just some of the few centres which will be in the village And each of these centres will actually be uh in a mini forest When you are in any one of these centres it will be completely isolated from the rest in terms of uh you'll not be able to see the other centres when you are in any one of the BBBany one of theRRR centres
<$A> Uh I'm just wondering why you decided to call it international village and maybe not international centre
<$B> Well uh it's because it's a village I mean the way BBBthe wayRRR it is uh envisaged is to be a village It's a village of centres Okay The IIIint the RRRthe village is going to be a village of international centres So that's basically why we call it international village but maybe let me say the word international is there because this village is going to be uh open to all peoples of the world I mean specifically from Africa but really it is open to everybody
<$A> So you are giving me the impression that the village has not as yet started operating
<$B> Uh well it has started operating in a sense because uh over the last uh four years we've been mounting international workshops at the University of Dar es Salaam as preliminary activities to the RRRthe village Uh we have for example uh already located the uh physical RRRphysical space for the BBBfor theRRR village We have also uh some offices at the International Conference Centre in Arusha for the village So really it has started but of course we have to start uh in phases and what we are doing now is really to set up the infrastructure to get ready to continue with our activities
<$A> Uh now since you began some four years back what are the hitches some of the hitches that you have uh encountered
<$B> Uh by hitches you mean uh setbacks or
<$A> Yeah constraints
<$B> constraints
<$A> Yeah
<$B>Of course there have been several constraints because uh the first constraint really has been uh a constraint in our RRRour desire to build a village in people's minds first because uh we RRRwe were really struggling to build this village in the people's minds so that we can get the necessary support Uh of course we have been using Radio Tanzania and the newspapers and giving uh various public lectures here and there uh but still we RRRwe are really BBBwe are reallyRRR not we've really not managed to reach everybody and I think even a programme like this one is one of those
<$A> Uh yeah well I understand that uh in Tanzania we have a lot of research institutions and uh technology programmes or projects going on How are you going I mean as International Village for Science and Technology how are you going to complement efforts with these research institutions in the country so that there is no uh duplication of efforts
<$B> Uh the village is going to provide what RRRwhat cannot be provided under the existing infrastructure Uh we don't have an infrastructure at the present that can provide a person with uh a continuous uninterrupted period of concentration Uh you see I RRRI RRRI IIIwi RRRI normally compare research and innovation to uh the process of RRRof RRRof RRRof drilling for oil I mean when you drill for oil or even if RRRif you drill for water uh you find that the RRRthe RRRthe deeper you drill the harder it gets but then you but you have to dig deep enough to actually get the oil or the water So we RRRwe are in a situation whereby the environment which we live in does not really allow for deep digging in terms of innovation Uh therefore the village will provide really what cannot be provided by the existing infrastructure not only in Tanzania but the RRRthe whole of Africa I believe So that's one way and uh we are going to complement the efforts of these institutions by providing a place where the visitors and the scientists and technologists in these institutions can actually visit the village for extended periods of say one month three months six months to complete whatever they may have been they may have started wherever they are Uh I can give an example for example a professor in the University of Dar es Salaam or Sokoine University of Agriculture who has IIIdev has an idea or who has uh done something but he needs a period of uh an uninterrupted period of time He can come to the village to complete whatever he's done uh In order to ensure that we don't have duplication we have uh we RRRwe RRRwe really uh RRRi RRRi involved the RRRthe institutions of higher learning in the in writing of the memorandum in the course of the association of the village which is really the constitution that guides the village Uh in our membership the University of Dar es Salaam is a member of the village the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology the Sokoine University of Agriculture there they were they are members of the village and this was done deliberately in order to make sure that there is no duplication That is the objectives of the village do not duplicate the objectives of these institutions And all along we RRRwe RRRwe intend to uh operate with uh to incorporate all institutions which are dealing with research and innovation in this country uh The Tanzania the RRRthe Ministry of Science and Technology uh Science Technology and Higher Education will also be involved In fact we have also we have talked to the BBBto theRRR minister and the he is fully in support of the initiative Uh in short really we are trying to ensure that we don't duplicate the efforts of the institutions rather we complement those efforts in that we try to make uh whatever those institutions were created for be realised in more concrete terms
<$A> Do you have uh specific policies that will govern the running and operation of the International Village for Science and Technology
<$B> Uh maybe if you elaborate by policies what do you mean
<$A> I mean uh whether you're going to be a non-governmental or you're going to be a department within the Ministry of Higher Education and Science and Technology
<$B> Well uh the village has been registered as a non-governmental international organisation uh That was necessary because there's no way you're going to have an international organisation as IIIpar as a department of a ministry or a department of any institution in a country uh That was necessary also in order to make sure that the village can actually uh have minimum bureaucracy uh Really bureaucracy is one of the things which really make people unable to move Uh maybe if I elaborate there It is our feeling that if for example a scientist were to make an innovation in the village that maybe gives the village ten million US dollars Well the village wouldn't mind to give the guy maybe even a million dollars I mean there's no BBBthere's noRRR doubt about it But I think if you are in a bureaucratic institution or if you are a department of a ministry or a department of uh another institution I think such things may not be possible because of bureaucracy uh Our aim is to make sure that a scientist or a technologist when he  come><+_comes> or she comes to the village he or she is completely free uh in terms of his brain is completely free to discover and is not impeded by anything at all This is really our RRRour ultimate goal And I think this is the BBBthis is theRRR environment which our counterparts in developed countries are having uh People in Japan in United States in Britain they're having the scientists there They have these environments and that's why they are making a lot of discoveries uh And when our people go there they also make breakthroughs In fact some of them when they go there to do their PhDs they get RRRthey RRRthey do better than their counterparts there but only when they come back home when I mean home I don't mean just Tanzania but all over the Third World when they go back home they find that they cannot continue this research or even if they continue they really don't make the breakthroughs which their counterparts who completed their RRRtheir studies abroad with them uh do So the point of departure is after completing our studies Otherwise as far as the brains are concerned I think each country has its own uh BBBits ownRRR uh brains it has its own uh uh talents I think the RRRthe if RRRif for example one were to do a IIIstatistic a statistical analysis of the distribution of talents on earth I'm sure one would really IIIgi find that the distribution is the same But then the point of departure is after finishing training
<$A> You mentioned uh innovators and uh discoverers performing better in uh other environments I mean other than in Tanzania
<$B> Or in Africa
<$A> Okay in Africa uh In your International Village for Science and Technology how are you going to motivate these uh innovators and discoverers because past experience has shown that uh these people end up getting the prizes and then you don't hear anything else about them
<$B> Uh I think uh IIItha that's one of the problems we want to solve because giving a person a prize by itself does not really uh I mean that's a temporary thing uh with RRRwith us we are having the continuity that the village is always there and whenever you've something to discover you are invited to the village So that the RRRthe innovator even if the innovator gets a RRRa reward for a discovery today he knows he can go there tomorrow and do the same and get the same uh BBBthe sameRRR BBBthe sameRRR uh uh reward I think the problem of giving a prize for a single invention and forgetting is uh it is uh I think it RRRit cannot be avoided so long as we continue with uh the RRRthe present situation uh the What I'm saying is that the scientist or the technologist will know that there is a place where I can go and bang my head and uh I IIIwha I'll be rewarded accordingly uh because really uh of course innovations uh an innovation  depend><+_depends> There are uh innovations which are not uh BBBare notRRR marketable but really if you can do an innovation that is marketable you should be able to rely on that innovation for the rest of your life 
S1BINT8T
<$A> However up to the end of nineteen eighty-one the plant was administered by both the Ministry of health and National Chemical Industries so as to facilitate the smooth transfer This event marked the beginning of the plant as a parastatal conducted <O/> on a commercial basis rather than a non-profit service
<$B> Now in a nutshell <name/> how many divisions are there within the administrative network of the company
<$A> Well we have First we have the production department I mean We have the production department Well we have two divisions the tabletting divisions and the divisions concerned with the production of infusions Also we have uh the administrative administration department We also have the commercial department We have uh accountancy department and uh lastly uh we have the technical department
<$B> uh So you are the head of infusions division and what is it all about
<$A> Well the infusions division as such is concerned with the preparation of sterile products these being the intravenous fluids or in other words they are known as infusions These are solutions which are RRRinde injected directly into a vein and therefore the solution is introduced directly into the RRRbood blood stream uh The large whole of injections often called infusions or rather the intravenous  fluid><+_fluids> they are frequently needed to replace body fluids lost from circulation as a result of shock or severe burns vomiting diarrhoea haemorrhage and other certain diseases
<$B> uh Well uh I'm a bit swayed by the application of technical terms I can say uh but uh uh learning from what you have told us is that you're dealing with infusions 
<$A> yes
<$B> uh and that means uh as you RRRyou called them intravenous fluids uh would you take us to the process uh which necessitates the manufacturing of such fluids I mean the materials you use 
<$A>Wwell as I already said that these products are sterile products so in fact even uh the process of manufacturing these fluids they're a bit complicated
<$B> RRRmhm RRRmhm 
<$A> We need uh qualified personnel who are really much committed to their work and uh the environment IIIwhich where we are working has to be very clean and to allow as minimum as possible the inclusion of other let's say bacteria or dust particles and so on 
<$B> uh and where do you get the raw materials
<$A> Usually the raw materials are all imported with exception of water which is our main uh uh I mean the major quantity of the uh I mean the product itself is water Apart from that the rest of the raw materials are imported We get them from different countries from mostly from Netherlands uh from France from uh and some other few countries I can say
<$B> You have just referred to uh clean working conditions and uh you said that uh that is generally meant for limiting bacteria uh Can you say how Can you tell us how uh such things like IIIen RRRlike  bacterias><+_bacteria> can be limited from uh from affecting your IIIy IIIaff affecting the materials that you produce
<$A> Well first of all we must have a minimum number of people working in that area 
<$B> RRRmhm
<$A> You know the area must be very cleaned thoroughly cleaned throughout the working I mean throughout the working time so even the personnel themselves have to be very clean and the materials we are using the utensils we are using have to be very clean and usually the room which we use for the preparations I mean the atmosphere has been sterilised by using ultra-violet light which we switch on overnight so at least we find that the bacteria is minimised in IIIth RRRin those areas 
<$B> And uh would do you elaborate a bit on the sections in which uh the material passes before you get the final products
<$A> Oh well we have uh three main sections in our production area We have the preparation section We have the clarity section and also the packing section The preparation section uh deals with distillation of water We have double distilled water This is uh also one of the main steps we are taking in ensuring that the product is uh uh at least sterile 
<$B> RRRmhm
<$A> distillation of water I mean uh the water is being heated by steam 
<$B> RRRmhm
<$A> and uh the condensed steam is then uh re-distilled so at least the water we are using is double distilled water and before using it we have to make sure that uh it is maintained at high temperatures not uh so as to avoid growth of bacteria it is not less than eighty degrees centigrade and uh before using this water for the preparation we have another department the quality control department which deals with ensuring that uh this RRR this water is fit for the preparation of some of our products and uh preparation section deals with the mixing of the products I mean all the ingredients together with the water Second we have the clarity section This is really concerned with uh clarity of the product because this solution has to be clear and colourless The third station is packing where the finished product after being filled into the bottles it has to be labelled well-labelled and packed So there are the three main sections we have in our division 
<$B> and what are the packaging materials You mean only bottles
<$A> Well for the time being we used to have glass bottles but due to IIImm many disadvantages we have opted for using uh plastic bags They're of uh certain quality known as polypropylene so we use polypropylene bags 
<$B> And for somebody who is a layman like myself when you refer to such a term as What did you term it
<$A> IIIPoly IIIpoly It's polypropylene the bags A certain material of plastic anyway which can resist high temperatures because before I mean after filling the solution to the bottles
<$B> RRRmhm
<$A> in order to IIIass RRRto ensure that this bottle is sterile it has to be sterilised so you have machines used for the sterilising of these products The bags are then subjected to very high temperatures and pressure so as to at least to kill all the bacteria which might have been introduced Now these plastic bags at least they can withstand that high temperature because the sterilising temperature is one and a half hours at two hundred and twenty centigrade so at least the material of these bags they can withstand such high temperatures 
<$B> And uh after packing has been performed what is the next IIIde destination of the product 
<$A> Well after being packed this product is being sent to the storage department where it is kept under IIIquan quarantine because there are other tests which  has><+_have> to be performed by the quality control department before this product is released for use So the quality control department has again to ensure that this product is sterile and fit for use So what it does is that it has to do some tests analysis to make sure that uh this product has got the active ingredient it is supposed to have and also to perform the sterility test to make sure that there are no bacteria inside So after these tests have been performed and they found that they qualify to the IIIgo BBBto theRRR specifications then this product is then released for sale 
<$B> So you mean the quality control department is within the uh production division or how are they related in fact 
<$A> Well in fact two divisions they are related I mean the I mean the departments of production together with the quality control department They're two different departments but they're all related
<$B> RRRmhm RRRmhm
<$A> so wherever we produce this is starting from the raw materials the quality control department is concerned to make sure that this raw material is fit for the preparation of these pharmaceuticals and at the same time during the different stages of preparation the quality control department also has to ensure that uh this product has more than normal qualifications all the specified qualifications before we proceed to another step So IIIinp so wherever the other areas let's say perhaps doing the weighing there must be some small areas maybe in the weight so the quality control department is concerned about the quantity or the percentage content of the ingredients we are using so at least it will notify us that either we have to add some more or else we'll have to add some more water or some more of the salt before filling of the BBBof theRRR product 
<$B> And <name/> head of the infusion divisions <name/> Pharmaceutical Industries uh limited uh you have uh told us uh more about uh how you RRRyou produce the materials you call I mean the products you call infusions now uh one would also like to know uh what are the qualifications before one is considered to join your division for that matter 
<$A> Well uh as a pharmaceutical industry at least we would prefer that all who are working in this area or in this place have to have basic knowledge in pharmaceuticals The head of the division like myself I have to be BBBI have to beRRR a pharmacist 
<$B> by profession
<$A> by profession So myself I'm a pharmacist and I'm <O/> pharmacist and uh there is also one pharmaceutical assistant who is at least working under me and in my absence he can head the division The main qualifications of other staff is that they have at least to have Form Four education uh IIIpreferring preference with uh science subjects and uh these have to undergo some in-plant training of pharmaceutical production so these are usually called production assistants and uh where with these we have other production attendants who are usually concerned with the packing section so at least in the preparation section the staff has RRRhas to be they all have to be production assistants with minimum qualifications of Form Four education
<$B> And how does the production pattern look like I mean uh do you produce against customers' orders or uh you RRRyou IIIpro produce enough stocks for RRRfor future orders or something like that
<$A> Well we produce these according to the national demand but unfortunately we can't meet the demand cause of other small problems
<$B> RRRmhm which are the IIIpo problems
<$A> Well the main problems we are facing in the division for the time being is uh sometimes that we have a need of raw materials 
<$B> RRRmhm
<$A> Secondly the machines Of course all the machines are also imported so sometimes little frequent breakdowns of the machines we are stuck and we produce uh lower quantity of products than expected Thirdly we have other problems such as water cuts and electricity fluctuations which are very common here nowadays so that these are the main IIIproduc uh RRRmain problems we are facing in the division 
<$B> Yeah how is generally the impact of the shortage of raw materials as a problem Is it affecting you so much to an extent that you RRRyou find it quite painful I can say
<$A> Really but uh fortunately for the last uh two years we haven't faced the problem of raw materials
<$B> RRRmhm
<$A> yeah but the main problem in the meantime is electricity fluctuations and uh the breakdown of the machines whereby we have to also RRRto import the spare parts some of them which may not be available here so <O/> we are forced to stop production but uh not quite I can say we haven't stopped IIIcomp I mean production completely unless there are there is no electricity but we have uh very competent personnel in the technical department
<$B> RRRmhm
<$A> who are usually doing their best so as uh not to allow the frequent IIImach machine breakdown to stop the production 
<$B> And what about water You mean you don't have a reserve tank 
<$A> We do have but sometimes we also use water for the production of steam I mean uh water is not enough We need plenty of water for the washing and also as a raw material for the production
<$B> And how do you generally tackle the problem of electricity Maybe you have a generator machine something like that
<$A> RRRmhm Well we haven't uh yet had a standby generator so these uh electricity cuts and electricity fluctuations they really do affect us a lot in the production We don't have any alternative but uh we now have another new unit whereby we have proposed to have a standby generator in case of these
<$B> RRRmhm RRRmhm 
<$A> electricity fluctuations
<$B> RRRmhm RRRmhm is a timely move
<$A> yeah
<$B> yeah and one wonders also how you go about uh delegating tasks to the staff under you How is the process
<$A> Do you mean yes we have uh three as I've already said we have three different sections in the division
S1BINT9T
<$B> For the past year we've uh been working on uh our normal programme which includes counselling giving free clinical advice and uh social rehabilitation to victims of domestic and sexual violence But we've also been conducting our outreach programme where we whereby we visit schools we visit uh community centres religious organisations and so on to discuss the whole question of violence and what it entails and how the society can come together to fight it We've also been conducting workshops for police officers which is uh part of the IIIinitia IIIini of the initiative started by the former Minister for Home Affairs uh uh Honourable Mrema when he made a call to TAMWA to conduct police workshops for police officers on gender sensitisation to IIIes especially to help victims of domestic and sexual violence We've also opened sixteen new centres in and around Dar es Salaam which are at the moment quasi autonomous but we're hoping that in the future they'll be fully autonomous
<$A> I'm interested to know more about uh the research that you conducted for the police force How did this come into uh inception
<$B> Uh uh on the eighth of March uh this year in nineteen ninety-four the Minister the former Minister for Home Affairs uh Honourable Mrema visited the crisis centre as uh part of uh as part of the festival to mark the International Women's Day And when he visited the centre he made a donation of one million shillings and made a call to the centre in TAMWA to conduct workshops RRRworkshops for police officers in Dar es Salaam as part of a gender sensitisation initiative so that police officers become sensitised on the issues of violence and uh against women and children and how they can help women and children when such incidents occur Therefore we RRRwe conducted a series of ten workshops whereby thirty police officers from eleven centres police uh stations in uh Dar es Salaam that included men and women and uh the workshops uh included uh subjects like counselling para-legal skills uh gender sensitisation the whole issue of human rights and so on And at the end of uh three months we presented them with certificates and we are glad to say that we have kept in close contact with police officers because we feel that uh the centre uh the crisis centre that it has a very important role to play in society and so do police officers we believe that we have to work very closely together in order to eradicate violence against women and children
<$A> And how do you feel the subjects or things were taken by the police force
<$B> Uh well the first of all the whole concept of gender sensitisation was a bit uh strange for them in the sense that they were not aware of certain concepts for example of concepts of equality between men and women when it came to the home They RRRthey it usually  happen><+_happens> in the offices where you can find a woman IIIoffice police officer who has a subordinate with a male but in the home they could not imagine that a man and a woman are equal and that a woman has RRRhas equal rights and also in terms of human rights for the woman and children Women and children have uh RRRhave the right to the whole notion of human rights So we introduced uh concepts of human rights to them in part as part of this gender sensitisation initiative After that we RRRwe RRRwe went full-scale into subjects like para-legal skills and counselling management and so on Initially we started with the whole notion of human rights
<$A> Okay and I believe you also told me that you opened some branches of the crisis centre up you know in the suburbs of Dar es Salaam
<$B> Yes we did We opened sixteen new centres uh in uh RRRin the three districts of Dar es Salaam But we also opened them we went beyond to Coast region We opened for example at <name/> at uh RRRat uh <name/> at uh <name/> at <name/> and so on And we also trained counsellors from those centres We trained about twenty-five counsellors from those centres so uh on skills like counselling and para-legal so that they know how to BBBthey know how toRRR operate the centres
<$A> How did you identify these areas
<$B> We approached them through the <name/> offices and we RRRwe RRRwe asked them to identify women who have shown initiative in terms of campaigns and when we met with these leaders these women we talked with them we talked to them about the whole issue of violence and then some of them put uh came forward and came up with the idea that they would like to have centres in their own areas And uh we decided that they needed training So we trained them for three months and then went to open the centres
<$A> Do you feel Leila after doing all this work the groups that you've trained so far really understand the whole concept of violence against women and gender sensitisation
<$B> Yes they do because you see it's part of the training During the workshops we conduct skits which are very short uh dramas based on real life experiences We RRRwe show skits of domestic violence We show skits of sexual violence whereby a woman is RRRis put in a situation uh where she is put in a situation as a victim and what happens when she is a victim So when they watch the skits sometimes they do take part in the skits themselves uh they can internalise the whole concept and it becomes even more realistic to them
<$A> And uh what else did you do I mean for NGOs perhaps
<$B> We trained about uh six other NGOs from different parts of the country from Mwanza from Mbeya Njombe from uh Tabora from uh Singida from Same on NGO management para-legal skills and counselling so that they can also open centres in their own areas
<$A> Was this a request by them
<$B> Yes it was a request by them because uh part of the initiative in the centre is to produce literature on uh our RRRour work in the centre as well as on concepts of violence what the law says about violence which we call them uh legal RRRlegal literacy They some of the groups got hold of the pamphlets and got hold of our address and they wrote to us and asked us if they could come and train with us In fact we trained about sixty people from the IIIdif from the other NGOs and we trained about thirty police officers and we trained about twenty-five people from the new RRRnew crisis centres the smaller ones So you find that we've been doing a lot of training this year which means to a large extent we've been sort of the centre has had a multiplying effect We have had new centres opening up and we hope that in the future many many more centres will be opened up throughout the country
<$A> People might argue that uh perhaps TAMWA is expanding too much because now you are training people as far as Mbeya also How do you make follow-up for instance
<$B> Well uh the groups in Mbeya are autonomous They have registered in their own They've their own constitutions They have their own uh uh framework of operations and so on But uh what we do is we give them skills that we learned the hard way See in TAMWA we didn't really have a blueprint with uh we had to learn by through RRRthrough trial and error And uh what we learned through trial and error we put down in RRRin the form of notes form of workshops participatory workshops we call them So what we do is we share our experiences with others And they RRRthey RRRthey learn from us but they also go to adapt what they learned from us to their own according to their own environment and situation And you find that it has a multiplying effect what they learned from us they go to the villages and they teach people there and the people in the villages go and teach others So you find that we have this very huge network A lot of them are autonomous and independent but we have a network in the sense that we are all closely emotionally connected and they write to us and we write to them Some of them got promoted and they wrote to me and said that they've got promotion Some of them became friends some of them uh contribute to <name/> magazine Some of them help to distribute our booklets our pamphlets and so on So we have a very big network
<$A> What are some of the problems that you encountered in the course of training and conducting these workshops
<$B> Uh I think the problems mainly have been in terms of concepts A lot of the concepts for example a lot of the notes that we've got from secondary sources were written in English So we had to translate them into Swahili in order for the village person people from the rural areas to understand Some of the concepts are really aren't IIItrans uh you cannot translate them into Swahili that would be very apt So we had to RRRto RRRto do skits to explain some of the concepts for to them to for them to understand We had to sort of mime and do plays and skits But uh eventually they did understand For example the whole issue of violence in terms of gender sensitisation how do you transmit that into proper Swahili so that a person from the village would understand what gender sensitisation means And uh you can see uh things like that but uh later on we came up with our own jargon I think we ought to put it in the Swahili dictionary so that it can be accepted but people understood and uh a lot of the ideas came from the participants to the workshops
<$A> And I mean you had these uh resounding successes you know conducting workshops and also getting letters afterwards that people had been promoted and also those wanting to get in touch with TAMWA Now how do you  vision><+_envision/envisage> you know the coming year What are you going to do
<$B> Well uh we want to uh conduct the outreach programme nation-wide So far we've conducted the outreach programme in Dar es Salaam Coast region and uh Coast region Dar es Salaam in Morogoro Tabora Kilimanjaro and uh some parts of uh Tanga and Zanzibar But we want to conduct the RRRthe RRRthe outreach programme throughout the country What we want to do is we want to have an outreach team that would be based in Dar es Salaam that would train people from those areas to come Others the outreach team goes travels to that area and trains IIItea local teams because they'll be more adaptable they'll be more acceptable to their own people there they would know the area more train them on outreach techniques so that they can conduct the outreach programmes We also have plans to open hundreds of centres throughout the country but uh our constraints are funds and also in terms of linkages How do we link with these people because the people have to come forward to ask us to help them establish a centre We just can't go from Dar es Salaam and go to a strange area and say we want to open a centre We wouldn't be accepted in that area The idea has to come from the people themselves
<$A> So far the crisis centre has used the approach of multi-disciplinary How do you hope to involve maybe the youth so that they can also be part and parcel of this and grow up you know with the concept of you know self-advancement in terms of uh violence against women
<$B> We have a programme here which we're IIIgo BBBwhich we areRRR going to start in January uh In fact the co-ordinator is not here It's <name/> She is co-ordinating a programme on the child labour It's called a programme on child labour And on this programme we're going to use the young people to talk to the young people What the what TAMWA will do is to provide training for the outreach team on outreach techniques pamphlet production and so on And then we're going to get the young people to go and talk to the young people about the rights of the child about uh human rights regarding the child about uh child labour about uh child uh abuse child defilement child sexuality about drug abuse and so on

<$A> This is Spotlight on Tanzania a programme that highlights some of the country's achievements This week our focus is on  the> Sadolin's Tanzania Limited a factory which manufactures paints Sadolin's Tanzania Limited is a paint making factory which is situated along Pugu Road not very far from the Tazara Mechanical Centre The firm which is privately owned has its headquarters in Copenhagen Denmark and receives the bulk of its technical aid from the Scandinavian countries Apart from manufacturing paints for various uses it also produces glue and other related products One aspect which attracted the producers of this programme when they visited the factory premises is the efforts being undertaken by the factory's management to resort to the use of local materials in the production process which amounts to sixty per cent This wisdom arises from the fact that the nation is currently plagued by lack of foreign exchange <ea/>Ndugu Adabo Moshi has served thirteen years with the company and knows a lot about the company's operations How did the Sadolin's Tanzania Limited come into being <ea/>Ndugu Moshi 
<$C> Uh Sadolin's paints started in nineteen uh sixty-three near uh <O_><O/> in the north and uh we  shift><+_shifted> from uh from that place it was a go-down we  shift><+_shifted> from there in nineteen sixty-eight we  start><+_started> a new company Sadolin's 
<$B> How did it come up We are told that there are BBBthere areRRR branches outside the country also Is there any connection between the those branches and this particular one 
<$C> Uh this company that is a branch from Nairobi it was in Nairobi and our *headquarter> it was Denmark and there is a branch in Kampala and a depot from Mwanza but they RRRthey just uh can't get Mwanza they're now Sadolin's 
<$B> What types of paints uh does your factory produce 
<$C> Uh we produce water paints oil paints automotives uh <O/> paints emulsion paints We use a local raw material now because of shortage of foreign kinds we don't have so we decided to find another way of RRRof this 
<$B> What types of uh raw materials are used in the manufacture of paints 
<$C> We have uh different types Some of them we get them from abroad and a few of them we get here in Tanzania as a local material
<$B> Which of those do you get from abroad and uh and which uh RRRwhich are locally produced 
<$C> Really we there is oil paints Oil paints you don't have here and uh some of the powders we get them from abroad of which here we can get them but we have uh few of the powders we can get here 
<$B> I'm told that uh you are also embarking on a programme of using raw materials because of the constraints of foreign exchange Uh could you tell us something on this programme
<$C> Uh really we'd send our RRRour report getting the raw material quantity we need from the Bank of Tanzania but we didn't get Then we are now using some other companies which uh they need paints they just bring us uh the quantity of paints they want Then we can we write down uh a list of raw material we need for making that  paints><+_paint> and then they just send a letter to the Bank of Tanzania that's just to cover foreign currency then they bring the materials then we make the paint for you 
<$B> Apart from the raw materials you get from abroad <ea/>Ndugu Moshi I'm particularly interested uh in knowing what types of local materials you use in the manufacture of paints 
<$C> Uh here we use some of them we have only powders and uh there is our glue which we are getting them near and uh few of them but not as uh now we are using local material sixty per cent as the general manager told you 
<$B> What do you do say about the standards and quality of your paints you produce 
<$C> <ea/><O_><O/> in uh we have uh these oil paints There are three types of paints we have and uh water paints we have about uh four in number We have first quality second quality and third quality and fourth quality 
<$B> uh What would you say uh compared to international standards what is the standing of your paints you produce here
<$C> <O/> our stand of producing paints if we get uh raw material we can make uh good quality If we don't have uh raw material so we just produce less From more local material we get from here in Tanzania we get powders like kaolin which we get from <O/> mining and uh we have these pigments we get them from Mwanza and and there is other things like glue we get them from uh RRRfrom <O/> Limited from Tanga uh and there are some <O/> for filling pens some of them we get from <name/> and some of them others we get from <name/>
<$B> uh Does the quality of the paints change whether you use local or materials imported from outside 
<$C> Yes there are some changes because uh you see we make a test first when we receive the local materials here and then we compare with the imported raw materials Then we RRRwe can put some percentages of uh local material and the imported raw materials so you can BBByou canRRR see that we have uh we use a little raw material from abroad and use a lot local raw material yes
<$B> uh Would you briefly <ea/>Ndugu Moshi tell our listeners uh the production line this stage the first stage in the manufacture of paints 
<$C> uh The first IIIimport the first stage of uh manufacturing paints first of all we RRRwe take uh small containers Small containers that is the big containers and the small containers We put them in a scale That's the first thing and then after that we take a formula of all raw materials which needed to make a paint and then we weigh it  in><+_on> a scale through their kilos written in the formula Then after that we send it to the mixer machine You stir it There is time of stirring them and then putting step by step Then you end up the paints 
<$B> How are your training programmes as the uh training officer of Sadolin's uh factory 
<$C> Well you see there is those illiterate people they don't know how to to read and then but after training them they know how to write and read and some of them uh they know how to talk English because some of our raw materials are written in English so they have to know how to read English and uh I've sent some of the people here too from abroad one of them but he's not here He has already resigned and uh one from Nairobi and uh we are training others people from <O/> to go to some other places like <ea/><O_><O/> for practice uh and there are others we send them from metal engineering from <name/> you know <name/> for training on maintenance on machines and uh I think it does
<$A> That was <ea/>Ndugu Moshi who apart from being the factory's supervisor is the training officer Juhata branch chairman and raw materials' controller <ea/>Ndugu Resa Ganji is the assistant production manager who is a chemical engineer by profession Although he has been with the company for a very short spell he was able to furnish us with the factory's details Here is <ea/>Ndugu Ganjii narrating the whole procedure of producing paints 
<$D> Well we have basically two kinds of paint here uh We make emulsion paint which is water-based and uh we make oil paint which is oil-based or alkyd resin-based I'll talk a little bit on the emulsion paint first which is water-based Basically the water paint consists of uh the emulsion which is water and a glue and the pigments which give us the colour finally Uh first uh this process as such is a physical process We start by adding all the powders mostly the pigments and the extenders plus the glue in a BBBin aRRR vat which is a sort of a drum a pre-measured drum All these ingredients are weighed and then put inside the drum mixed with water That's basically our process The formulation indicating the quantities of which ingredient is already tailor-made and uh it is conceived in Denmark Sadolin's uh headquarters there in the main lab So what we basically do we got to just take the formulation read the formula which is already made and do the mixing of the paint here The same thing applies uh with the RRRthe oil paint It's just that the ingredients are different There in the oil paint we don't use water we use mostly the the resins but the pigments are just the same After the mixing of the paint the paint is subjected to some tests which are again prescribed by the Sadolin's headquarters in Denmark uh We carry  on><+_out> tests uh for such as viscosity tests uh density specific gravity drying time and opacity 
<$B> And how is the colour of the paints determined 
<$D> uh The colour of the paints IIIdetermine we have an equipment called a colour-meter which measures the colour of the paint The colour of the paint of course is imparted by pigments various pigments and uh mixing of various pigments as well 
<$B> <ea/>Ndugu Resa Ganji as the assistant production manager of Sadolin's uh factory uh apart from the uh manufacture of paints what also does the factory engage in 
<$D> Well uh apart uh from manufacturing paints we manufacture spot putty I mean putties We manufacture varnishes as well and uh I think that's it now 
<$B> And  how><+_what> is the structure of the Sadolin's Tanzania Limited 
<$D> Well uh we have the managing director followed by the general manager and the factory manager who's in charge of the factory area The factory manager of course is assisted by RRRby me and uh a mechanical engineer who looks after the machines you know
<$B> Uh what is the factory's production capacity 
<$D> The factory's uh capacity is about uh twenty thousand litres per annum That's combined output including oil and emulsion paint But at the moment because of the constraints in foreign exchange which have resulted in uh lack of raw material we are doing about uh  eighty><+_eighteen> thousand litres 
<$B> uh In fact <ea/>Ndugu Moshi just mentioned the constraint of foreign exchange In fact I wanted to know  at><+_to> what extent would you say uh lack of foreign exchanges affected your operations and what are you doing about that 
<$D> Well uh the lack of foreign exchange has affected our operation as it has in RRRin many industries Our RRRour capacity now is almost sixty per cent but uh we are trying to uh make efforts to find a local substitute of raw material which will fit into our formulations and in this field I RRRI can say that we have made some progress We have uh for instance in our emulsion paint the pigments consumed  is><+_are> for about sixty per cent locally available uh and right now we are experimenting on some other pigments which are also locally available 
<$B> uh Does the fact that you are now getting uh in local raw materials uh does it change the quality of your paints in any way
<$D> uh No so far our quality has remained consistent despite the fact that we are substituting local raw material Of course uh when we are substituting we are going very cautiously and uh making a lot of research before we conclude any product but so far we have had no problems with our product 
<$A> <ea/>Ndugu Resa Ganji Despite the elaborate plans of the company's training programme some workers are yet to learn to speak English the so-called language of civilisation But that is not a handicap because they know their work Here is one of them <ea/>Ndugu <name/> who mixes the raw materials for paints production in its early stages What does he do
<$E> My duties include mixing paints after carefully following the formula by paint experts in the first stage of production After that I work on these containers of six hundred litres and nine hundred litres I apply the code numbers like water which has a  professionally><+_professional> number I measure the requirements and work on them After that the experts come to assist and to check my work When I'm through I send it to my next colleague who passes it to the mixing machine 
<$A> And the following sound tells you how the actual mixing is undertaken 
<$A> From there the next stage in the production line is the tinting section where the colour of the paints is determined

<$A> We present Women's Half-Hour
Welcome once again to another edition of Women's Half-Hour Today we bring you an interview with Professor Anna UUUTbeijuka about the National Women Council BAWATA Stay tuned
<$A> The National Women Council BAWATA which was registered recently was established in July nineteen ninety-four but it is a known fact that majority of women in this country still do not know the aims and objectives of the council Professor Anna UUUTbeijuka interim chairperson of the council elaborates
<$B> Well the objectives of the uh National Women's Council or BAWATA is to unite all women you know in their struggle for equality The idea here there are many women groups there are many women individuals who are concerned you know  by><+_about> the unequal position of women in society So the council is here to act as an umbrella organisation and provide a united forum where women can meet and discuss their position and lay out strategies on how to proceed 
<$A> The council is still new to most of us Now can you please tell us the organisation's structure and the membership procedures 
<$B> Well uh BAWATA was formed actually in July last year by National Women's Conference which was held at the University of Dar es Salaam where about four hundred women met Every region was presented by about seven representatives The idea was to capture a broad spectrum of women interest groups uh you know there were for example women from the ruling party women from the opposition women from uh the Islamic community women from the Christian community women from economic NGOs They all assembled in UUUKuruma last year at the UUUKuruma Hall University of Dar es Salaam and unanimously decided to form this umbrella organisation which is called BAWATA you know So it is a new it is newly registered but it has been operative now for the last nine months Uh it is true that it is a as a new organisation many people have not heard about it but actually its origin is that it has IIImembersh members founder members are found all over Tanzania In all regions of Tanzania BAWATA has founder members So it is an idea which will spread very very quickly throughout the  countryside><+_country> 
<$A> Now can you tell us the membership procedures in case one wants to join  with> the council 
<$B> Yes the organisational structure of BAWATA actually starts from the grassroots It's a grassroots organisation It has a structure which we can call which is vertical in the sense that you have village to the district to the region and then to the national level but then it is also horizontal It is horizontal structure in the sense that women can join as individuals or they can join as groups so for example if you have a group of women who are interested in raising chicken in a village and others who are maybe sewing who are sewing who are doing handicraft they can also their groups can also join BAWATA So you have what you call a horizontal co-ordination of women activities at village level or at district level at national level and then you have a vertical structure so that you have a democratic representation So it is a democratic institution in the sense that you reach the grassroots so that the national leaders have contact with the grassroots Horizontal that women can talk with each other even if they have different interests It is a non-partisan women's organisation in the sense that it does not BBBit does notRRR discriminate anybody Women from different political parties can join In fact the women's sections in political parties can join UWT for example can join BAWATA if they like The women members in CHADEMA can join BAWATA if they like Their section can join BAWATA so it does not discriminate Women lawyers can join Professional women groups can join BAWATA So the RRRthe procedures then for joining will be that when the branches are RRRare established in uh RRRin districts and in regions and then finally in the villages uh women will just apply for membership The membership fee is only two hundred fifty shillings It is the IIIlow that is a minimum and the idea is to make it to keep the fee accessible to most of the women so the fee that it must be something that the majority of women can afford So you apply for membership and if twenty-five people in a BBBin aRRR BBBin aRRR village are necessary and fifteen people at a place of work like Radio Tanzania You need fifteen women to open your branch but if you are not BBByou areRRR BBByou are notRRR enough you can invite your neighbours you know surrounding offices can also join your group and you can open your branch So the procedure for membership is very simple Registration forms will be spread and women can just you know twenty-five or fifteen women gather up and form a branch It is as simple as that 
<$A> But uh from my experience sometimes it is really impossible to change somebody to something which she has used to do Now what methods are you going to use to convince these women to join with the council
<$B> Yes well I should explain very clearly here that uh actually BAWATA is an umbrella organisation so women don't have to give up anything to join BAWATA They just add BAWATA onto the list of activities they are doing So as an umbrella organisation you RRRyou can still keep your RRRyour membership in TAMWA for example in your case You RRRyou RRRyou would still IIIrem remain a member of TAMWA In fact that is BBBthat isRRR the Tanzania Media Women's Association for example I am assuming that you are a member of that association So that you don't have to give up that association to become a member of BAWATA You just join BAWATA and uh in fact even that association can join BAWATA because if that association for example wants to send a representative to the National Congress then they have to join BAWATA and I RRRI would like to believe that the women's association a professional women's association like TAMWA would like to be in the national congress then they would join BAWATA So you don't this is something that you just become richer you add something onto yourself You RRRyou don't lose anything else I think it is really selling itself but all the same we are going to spend a lot of time on education you know informing the people what this organisation is all about making clarifications We have to clarify things which I was saying it's a new thing so you have to clarify 
<$A> So if the UWT member can join BAWATA the UUUChedema woman can join BAWATA the <name/> girls can join BAWATA Now are you not afraid that the CCM woman can bring CCM ideas or the UUUChedema woman can bring the UUUChedema ideas Are you not afraid that uh chaos might happen or might erupt on the way 
<$B> Actually uh the idea of a non-partisan women's organisation of course people will still remain with their ideas but you see people join BAWATA well because of the importance of meeting as women to discuss our problems the RRRthe common line the *commonalty> that as women we are discriminated So for example women from different political parties will join BAWATA because they would like to have a forum where they can breathe in space leave back party positions ideology and things like that and just talk as women you know So definitely those who are not yet enlightened will be enlightened that this is a forum which is non-partisan where everybody is equal and where everybody is valued And women are not a homogeneous group For sure they have different views They see things differently but we are united in the IIIdec to fight the discrimination against us That is the whole point so that we do not really foresee with the proper education we IIIshoul we'll not foresee any problems because our members will be enlightened that we are meeting here that the whole purpose of joining BAWATA you know is to leave behind you know party positions and party heckling and you know fan being a fan you know being excessive You RRRyou are coming in a forum where you can keep cool and discuss the problems of women and the strategies to solve such problems 
<$A> Professor UUUTbeijuka you can talk at length about the RRRthe council but uh so long as they are not going to benefit anything from the council they won't be able to join with uh BAWATA Now can you tell us what is the difference between the council and the other women organisations such as UWT 
<$B> Well you see the UWT is a women BBBa womenRRR section in a political party and I think the RRRthe RRRthe RRRthe RRRthe political parties are also establishing you know their women wings So I think CHADEMA is also trying to establish its own and <name/> is trying to establish its own etcetera etcetera etcetera and the UWT of course is a BBBis aRRR BBBis aRRR quite a big organisation It has been here for quite some time and uh during in the old system they were you know they were a machinery you know for a voice for all the women Now they're a voice for all CCM women BAWATA is bringing all those voices under one house under one umbrella as I say hence the name of an umbrella organisation The difference uh between the First of all I should clarify that there is no competition between BAWATA and UWT It is honorary collaboration uh UWT and many other similarly placed women sections in political parties these are women who are aspiring for political leadership They are a member of a political party It's because a political party by definition is a group of people who want to get the powers of the state to govern BAWATA is a civic organisation It is not seeking governance per se but it is seeking good governance So BAWATA is an IIIorganis is a civic society what we call civic society uh BAWATA is not uh is promoting women but this under our constitution now this can only be done within political parties so for example BAWATA we are encouraging women to come up and RRRand RRRand RRRand RRRand contest the next election They cannot do it under BAWATA for the constitution that we have This they have to do within political parties so BAWATA is very easy busy trying to encourage women in CCM in CHADEMA in UTP <name/> etcetera etcetera please go forward make sure that your parties propose you for a candidate you see So BAWATA is a civic society organisation It is not seeking to get state power but UWT is a group of women leaders women who are aspiring for political leadership while the BAWATA women want good governance I think you can see the difference there 
<$A> Yes BAWATA was established only last year but I'm sure you have been doing something to promote women's development What are the current activities of the council 
<$B> Yes uh since we started uh the women who founded BAWATA this was at the UUUKuruma Hall University of Dar es Salaam they decided that four issues were very important The first issue was a question of land rights for women land rights for women and BAWATA has followed up this issue very closely uh We asked uh some uh experts at the University of Dar es Salaam and I was myself able to participate in that capacity as a professional woman We were able for example to present a paper at the National Land Conference which was held in Arusha and Minister UUULuasa was kind enough to RRRto you know give us an audience in that BBBin thatRRR conference and our argument was that women should get full land rights that time has come for women to get full land rights Another issue emphasised by the founder members and I think by many many women in Tanzania was the question of inheritance rights As you know many women many widows are really being you know being dispossessed by the relatives of RRRof RRRof RRRof their diseased husbands This situation now is increasing as the traditional uh uh kinship networks traditional customs break down

<$A> Please welcome to another half-hour of the programme Be My Guest Our guest today is Professor Leonard Shayo from the University of Dar es Salaam Leonard Shayo is a mathematics professor and also a project leader of the International village of Science and Technology based in Arusha Professor Shayo is with us now here in the studio and he chats with my colleague UUUSekunje UUUKitoye 
<$C> Professor Shayo my first question is uh how did you bring yourself where you are
<$B> Thank you Mr UUUKitoye uh I only started my primary education in nineteen fifty-four at a grammar school known as <name/> IIIprim middle school No I started at a BBBat aRRR national RRRnational native authority primary school and then I joined the <name/> middle school in IIInine middle school RRRin nineteen sixty-two Let me say that the schools in those days the middle schools of those days were really like the secondary schools of today in the sense that uh the education was of a very high quality and really we had only one thing in mind just to pursue education with all our might So we managed to pass the class eight examination and then I went to <name/> Secondary School where I stayed until nineteen eighty-six nineteen sixty-six sorry And then I went to <name/> School where I started I studied pure maths applied maths and physics uh Those <O/> combinations were there Today they are not there And let me again say that again we had only one thing in mind and that is just to pursue knowledge uh After that uh when I reached form six in nineteen uh uh in nineteen sixty-eight after filling the forms to choose our career I selected to become a mechanical engineer that is to go to Nairobi because I thought being an engineer is a good thing But uh maybe by that we were visited by a professor from the university of Dar es Salaam Professor <name/> He was a professor of mathematics by then and he gave us a lecture in mathematics and I was very much impressed to see how elegant he was and how he made BBBhow he madeRRR his nice presentation So immediately I went to my headmaster and told him that I would like to RRRto join the university of Dar es Salaam and pursue education But I was made to go to my headmaster after asking that professor how can one become like you And he simply advised me that if you want to become like me uh select to go to the university of Dar es Salaam and take mathematics and education that is enter into becoming a teacher and that's what I did And uh after doing my examinations then I joined the university of Dar in nineteen sixty-nine But because my aim was to become like this professor I had to study very hard when I was at the university because I knew that if I did not perform well then I would have been I would have gone to teach in the schools which I really My aim was to become like professor <name/> So that's uh why I studied very hard and after finishing my first degree I got my first class and immediately I was given a scholarship to go to Britain University of London Again I knew my ambition was to become like professor <name/> so I knew I must get my PhD and after that I got my PhD nineteen seventy-seven at <name/> University and of course since then I've been working hard and there you have to work hard and publish to get promoted and so on
<$C> uh Exactly what do you do as a professor there at the University of Dar es Salaam
<$B> Of course there we uh the main responsibility there is to teach mathematics and also do research in mathematics But at present really and maybe since nineteen eighty eighty-seven I've been very busy in promoting this uh the International village for science and technology which I started then after spending my sabbatical leave at the International Centre for Theoretical Theses for two years That's nineteen eighty-five to eighty-seven And since eighty-seven then I've been very busy with this village So I must say that of course I do the teaching and also promoting this village whose objective is to bring about the scientific and technological revolution in Tanzania in particular and Africa in general.
<$C> You have been talking of the International Village for Science and Technology in Tanzania and uh my next question is about that uh which is uh The village is at Arusha What is this village all about
<$B> Well let me say that the concept of the village is at Arusha because really we have just started conceptualizing this village uh We have not really built the village as such The village is more now it's more in terms of projects and programmes We realize that it really takes a long time to build a whole village So we have started to run programmes After all BBBafter allRRR really the village eventually has to be uh a set of programmes and projects because even if we build the buildings the buildings by themselves will not  construe><+_construct> the village So after we realised that it will take us a long time to get the land to build the village and the buildings to RRRto I mean to be constructed So we have realised the village now in terms of just running the programmes which can be run without buildings At Arusha we have a small office which is the international conference centre which coordinates the programmes with the village Myself I'm at the University of Dar es Salaam I continue teaching at the university while at the same time IIIcoor coordinating the activities of this village We hope that after we get the land which we are looking for which is about twenty-five square kilometres of land we shall forest this land and then maybe construct an international primary school for the talented kids and then we go on constructing other structures in RRRin a priority basis
<$C> And about this Village of Science and Technology many people don't understand uh science and technology I mean these two words and what is the difference between uh these two words science and technology Can you elaborate on that 
<$B> Yah I think very briefly BBBvery brieflyRRR that science is the theory behind technology uh Technology has you know is realized from implementing the theories of science For example uh a simple example is the theory behind the RRRthe water engine is RRRis science but uh the realization of that theory into uh an engine which works is technology So technology is the is what happens after you transform theories into RRRinto practical gadgets uh The theory for example the uh if you discuss for example a disease like malaria uh the RRRthe technology uh the RRRthe medicine that is made to cure malaria is whatever it is it's technology But the theory behind that medicine is science.
<$C> Uhu There is a question of food importation in our country and uh there are some problems in IIIimport RRRin importing these foods from outside the country which some foods are IIIexpired have RRRhave expired Now Professor Leonard Shayo why don't we use the technology and science because we have the experts to make our own food or can our own foods here in Tanzania 
<$B> Well let me say that that question really it's RRRit's complicated in the following sense that the technology of food production is when technology there is really very little to be discovered Of course our scientists are being sent here and there but if really the issue is just to produce food well almost all the technology we need here is available It's available and what is maybe surprising is why don't we use this technology And in fact really one can discern some maybe bad motives in all this exercise Why should a country like Why should our countries I mean African countries but <O/> in particular we have all the resources to produce all the food we need The rivers flow all the year taking water to the sea and if you go back in history you'll find that in almost all countries where there are rivers civilisation started in those rivers The people in Egypt for example depend on the River Nile to irrigate the agriculture so one question uh which really is not a question to be directed to a professor like myself is a question that should be directed to the businessmen and the people's firms Why don't they use that the money they have to open big firms and produce the food in Tanzania rather than import the food from outside I mean that's a question that can be asked to people with firms and those people who are BBBwho areRRRimporting food uh into the country in the name of business Why can't the same business people invest in the in producing food in Tanzania when we know we have plenty of land we have so many rivers we could use to irrigate <-./>irrigat agriculture Why RRRwhy are they not doing that So that's a question that maybe I would say maybe in terms of the radio why don't you call them here and ask them why are they preferring to import food from outside rather than producing the food here in Tanzania or in Africa For one thing it is not profitable to produce food You know if you're investing in producing food you'll get more money than if you import the food and the proof is very simple Why are those farmers in America producing food and exporting to us It's because it's more profitable Otherwise they could have imported the food from us So they produce the food and sell to us because it's more profitable And with that argument why aren't our businessmen investing in food production and make more money if the aim is to make more money So personally if you ask me I'll say any RRRany move to import food into the country is more directed to us by very bad motive I'll RRRI'll RRRI'll maybe uh make one exception When there is a drought serious drought which you see then one can say let's import food from outside to save people from death but that's the only exception You see if you look at many of our countries the trees are green the grass is green meaning it rained If RRRif RRRif for example you tell somebody there's drought in this country the answer is you don't know what a drought is and if you want to know what a drought is you should go to Israel go to the deserts of the Sahara then you'll know what a drought is So my RRRmy RRRmyRRRmy impression is that although we say there's a drought in this country what we should say is there's drought in parts of the country but not in the whole country You travel from here to Dodoma it's all green on both sides of the road and there's no food growing maybe grass and trees You travel from here to RRRto Arusha it's almost all green The whole of the <name/> region is green and yet there is no food and people are importing food So my challenge to you people on the radio call the businessmen ask them why do they import food into the country rather than investing in the rich land we have along the river valleys in this country and produce food for this country and make more money That question they should answer 
<$C> Professor Leonard Shayo maybe don't you think it's uh because of the policies of the government that it doesn't give room to these businessmen or men who want to invest in the country to RRRto I mean to acquire big land so that they can farm.
<$B> I RRRI RRRI don't think I would say it is a policy of the government as such because I don't think there is anybody who has wanted land in this country to produce food and he's been denied that RRRthat land Unless this person goes to land which is already occupied by some peasants Of course that's not acceptable because the very good land that can be producing without much energy can be left to the peasants

for those who are just listening this week facing the microphone is the chairperson of the Mathematical Association of Tanzania Dr <name/> Massanga Dr Massanga you have said that MAT or Mathematical Association of Tanzania is a non-governmental organisation NGO and such organisations they do have some relationship with other non-organisations outside the country so far Has MAT involved in any of the international organisations the non-governmental organisations this year What is the organisation
<$B> uh IIIMA uh MAT  have><+_has> got uh correspondences with similar organisations in other countries We subscribe our bulletin to some similar organisations in Britain in uh USA and recently we are trying to have a link uh with some IIIorganis uh mathematical association in Italy and uh there is some correspondence with uh Namibia
<$A>And how does MAT meet its objectives
<$B> uh for the first twenty-five years MAT has been striving to improve the average rating levels and standards of performance in the subject through various activities For instance uh in order to develop to share and to disseminate the original knowledge in the subject MAT publishes a bulletin The bulletin is called the Tanzanian Mathematical Bulletin and two uh issues come out annually This is for members Then there is a junior bulletin for students which is published uh once a year So far over forty-two volumes of the bulletin and over IIIfor RRRover ten issues of the junior bulletin have been published Next for improving the quality of existing teachers and keeping them abreast of the subject matter and uh informing them of the latest development in the subject and in the maths education MAT conducts seminars and in-service training MAT has organised over twenty-four seminars at national level over fifteen seminars at grammar level and over seven in-service courses Thirdly in order to develop and stimulate interest of mathematics in students as well as to sharpen special ability and skills among gifted students in the subject MAT awards prizes to best-performing students in the National Examinations at Ordinary and A level It organises contests at national level and awards prizes It organises and sends students to international competitions MAT forms math clubs in schools and organises inter-school math fairs and exhibitions and uh also it organises research competitions
<$A> Dr <name/> Massanga you have also mentioned of the twenty-five years since the inception of the MAT or Mathematical Association of Tanzania And it is believed too that you are on your way that may be not very far that you will be celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary. Could you just give us a hint as to what will be done during the celebrations
<$B> During the forthcoming celebrations uh we are going to hold uh exhibitions uh students' exhibitions on mathematical objects uh as well as games and puzzles We are going to the book display of mathematics books published by MAT and MAT institutions and others We are going to have a display of posters on the history of mathematics and the history of MAT Then we are going to have our usual annual seminar In that seminar we are going to have uh lectures on different topics we are going to have a panel discussion on uh research uh mathematical research going on in the country We are going to have uh guest speakers who are going to talk about the educational systems in other countries and current trends and we are going to have a lecture of the year which is usually a topic that has not very much to do with mathematics And uh we are going to hold our annual general meeting in during which we are going to deliberate on problems facing the teaching and learning process in mathematics and uh we are going to come out with resolutions and recommendations which we usually send to policy makers policy implementors and uh the others who are concerned in the teaching process
<$A> Well before I take you to the problems or setbacks that are pressing the association Dr Massanga maybe I should ask you something on the celebrations I would like to know as to where and when are you going to have your celebrations and who will be the guest of honour
<$B> Our celebrations are going to take place at the Klerruu Teachers College in Iringa And this the opening ceremony will be on the sixteenth September nineteen ninety-one That is next Monday and uh in the afternoon we'll continue with a seminar which will end on the twenty-first of September nineteen ninety-one We are not yet sure about the guest of honour
<$A> And now back to the problems and setbacks Mathematical Association of Tanzania being a non-governmental organisation I'm sure it has its successes but before we reach to success may you please give us a hint on what are the problems or setbacks that MAT is facing
<$B> As usual many subjects are facing problems of textbooks problems of inadequate teachers and so on and so forth Mathematics is hard-hit because it is not easy to retain mathematics teachers in the teaching profession And uh to be able to tackle the problem of uh lack of requisite educational materials such as uh textbooks as well as uh teaching material MAT has been trying to produce a teaching aid and MAT has been trying to publish some books and teaching materials Well to so that one needs finance uh Some zones have tried to raise funds through charity work and other activities and by so doing they could acquire teaching materials and uh make teaching material using locally available material But this is very inadequate To publish books people have tried to write manuscripts but they face the problem of having these manuscripts published Again the standard of teachers themselves is not adequate To do to be able to raise it one has to organise in-service training courses Now these have been organised on ad-hoc-basis because the finances were not there So when we get a little bit of  finances><+_finance> from some donors we do that So our major setback has been lack of funds and the budget allocations to the ministries to whom we run for  finances><+_finance> has been getting tighter and tighter and this has caused a decline in the amount of resources we could get from them
<$A> Dr Massanga you being the chairperson of the Mathematical Association of Tanzania we understand that the problem when is known and a solution is found then you get successes But before you reach to successes may you first just tell us have you ever received any assistance from some of the outside non-governmental organisations like MAT and especially on the problems that you have mentioned or the setbacks that you have mentioned because the biggest you have mentioned is the finance Is there any international non-governmental organisation that has given you any assistance financially
<$B> uh in the past we used to get uh very little funds from various donors like the International Centre for Theoretical Physics and uh UNESCO and the others to finance our IIIseminar our annual seminars But this was very little indeed But recently we have entered a contract with the Harold Macmillan trust of London and uh this is for a three-year project This project is for publication of our teaching material that is book for secondary education as well as uh bulletins and news letters Also it is for in-service training which is to be spread throughout the different zones The project is half funded by the European Community We are still looking for the other half
<$A> Thank you very much Now to the successes I understand that having problems and having solutions of solving these uh problems then come successes I wonder whether the Mathematical Association of Tanzania has ever met with any successes so far in the in its twenty-five years of its existence
<$B> Well it is not easy to measure the success particularly where uh the number of mathematics students is increasing much more rapidly than the number of the teachers Even the number of the increased teachers is not retained in the teaching But we feel without the efforts of MAT I think the situation would have been worse because the seminars we organise annually attract a lot of the teachers and teachers gain a lot from them because they are some kind of an in-service training The bulletins we produce are reading material to the students to RRRto the IIIpu BBBto theRRR teachers The junior  bulletin><+_bulletins> also are reading materials to the students The well we talked about the bulletin and uh the contest we RRRwe organise the prizes we award these competitions and all that They stimulate interest in the students And uh I feel that MAT has done quite a lot towards uh sustaining the subject and they're trying to interest more students  into><+_in> the subject
<$A> Dr <name/> Massanga before we end this IIIpro programme uh I have something uh in person and that is about yourself You being the national chairperson of the Mathematical Association of Tanzania maybe some of the members who do not know uh you well would like at least to know your historical background We have just told them that you are the senior lecturer at the Mathematics Department at the University of Dar es Salaam But people may like to know more about you May you now give us a hint as to where did you study and what did you take while you were in your university or any other uh institution
<$B> Yes well I did my primary education in Mwanza and then my secondary education <name/> Secondary School and then <name/> College which was there later <name/> Secondary School Then I did my A levels at <name/> Secondary School I finished my <O/> nineteen seventy-two and started my Standard One in nineteen sixty-six Then I joined the University of Dar es Salaam in seventy-three after coming from <O/> National Service And there I took uh mathematics physics statistics first year Second year I majored in maths and uh physics Then I IIIjo immediately after my completion I joined the Mathematics Department as a tutorial assistant That was in July uh April nineteen seventy-six And in nineteen eighty I left for West BBBGerman><+_Germany> where I did a language course and uh of German and then joined the Technical University of uh Berlin And I did my PhD in free dynamics at the Technical University of Berlin Then I returned home and continued teaching <O/> in mathematics
<$A> Dr <name/> Massanga thank you very much for that uh brief historical background of yours But now maybe again another personal question And this one is on the problems your personal problems in lecturing and especially lecturing in mathematics A lot of people uh very fear that maybe for a woman to take such a field as a lecturer in mathematics uh some of us may think that women always are having a lot of things to do How do you combine your personal or private work and these well the job of lecturing at the mathematics department in the University of Dar es Salaam
<$B> Well uh what I can tell you is that uh when I joined the university my whole first year academic year I was pregnant And uh I combined that with my studies and I got my baby and uh the second year was tougher because I was breast-feeding and I had to go to the university and come home uh downtown to look after the RRRthe child And I got my son uh just when I registered for my Master That was my second child My third child I did my PhD exam today and the following day I was admitted for delivery in hospital So uh what I want to say is that I got three children while I was doing my three degrees uh it was not uh as easy as one could think of but I feel one can combine the two ideals and I succeeded My major problem actually is not uh all the maternal and marital responsibility which I have uh My major problem is all the prejudice The prejudice which is there that you're a woman it's not easy for you to do mathematics you have to prove beyond 
<$A> doubt
<$B> doubt that you can do mathematics This problem I felt it a lot more when I was in  German><+_Germany> because I had to look for a supervisor and I went around and it was not easy to get one

You and the Environment This is another edition of You and the Environment Today we bring you an interview with <ea/>Ndugu Ave Maria <name/> assistant lecturer with the Muhimbili College of Health Sciences about a research on gender and environmental management
<$A> A research on gender and environmental management is crucial in case the government intends to bring development among the people in this society That kind of a research was therefore conducted in Shinyanga rural district between nineteen ninety and nineteen ninety-two Ave Maria <name/> was one of the members who participated in the research In this interview with Radio Tanzania's Tenzi <name/> Ave Maria talks among other things the objectives and what has been discovered out of the research
<$B> uh The major objectives of the research was first to produce a gender profile on issues concerning women such as socio-economic and cultural and traditional elements of the area And secondly was to <O/> of energy supply and use of water IIIsupp energy supply and useand water supply Thirdly it was traditional management and control strategies of the natural resources uh Fourth it was to look at the constraints for women participation in the management and control of the environment or land such as land water forest etcetera And fifthly it was to propose action plan for women in Shinyanga Soil Conservation and Aforestation Project which is SHISCAP 
<$C> We hope with Ave Maria such a research might be useful in future in case the possible solutions are found to bring about change in the society Now what major environmental problems have you discovered still affecting people in Shinyanga
<$B> Uh to be sincere because we went there for a special task so the first thing which we discovered in Shinyanga this was during our pilot study in nineteen ninety First of all we found that at least the problems which were announced there uh The staff were just left to know they're just IIIgradua they're foresters They are technical people foresters and nobody cared about giving them the human element how to go about dealing with uh people you know So it was really difficult for them to IIIco RRRto communicate the message to the people so that it was the first issue which we discovered Secondly it was uh this problem of socio-cultural boundaries you understand because the Sokumas are very closed society So in order to penetrate them uh you really need to RRRto be among them This thing was really difficult for project people in Shinyanga because first they lack transport to go there and also some uh incentives to make them go and spend more time in the villages So it was again another constraint towards achievement of these programmes Thirdly we found that uh most of these projects were UUUtop down We found that people just sit somewhere and they think that these people they have this problem now how are we going to solve them You just send them uh sent people to introduce maybe UUUcentral conservation without prior consultation with the people So you find that people participation was lacking Uh and uh fourthly you find that women were not involved in planning of this project while at the end they were supposed to be implementers and this in IIIma RRRin most cases was due to the fact that the Sokuma culture is you know it's biased against women women are not supposed to appear in the public So whenever there is something to discuss and decide it is always men who  does><+_do> so So that was another constraint And uh fifthly when we went there we found that there were too many uh institutions and projects which were dealing with uh the same issue of environment but there was no coordination between them So we found that this is a problem because you find that today it is UUUHashi going there tomorrow it is uh World Vision International So it was like competing on the same person So instead of helping it was like you know sabotaging each other's work which we didn't see as a RRRa healthy situation So we're seeking maybe a coordinating body to be installed in the area And sixthly it was that those conserved  area><+_areas> lacked protection because we went there UUUHashi was spending a lot of time and uh council district council spent a lot of time and resources to establish these UUUcentral conservation RRRconserv conserved areas but you find that after they regenerate people now start sending their cattle there and you find that personnel you find in every division I think there was only one personnel who is not enough to IIIsa RRRto ensure the security of these uh uh reserved uh plots So for us that was a constraint but also for this uh we can link it with the people's participation because if they were really involved in the whole process they were supposed to be the uh RRRthe security to provide the security for these  area><+_areas> So those are the main constraints which we discovered and which took us to the main study now which took us uh two years to complete
<$C> Apart from the constraints you mentioned I'm sure talking to the respondents they might probably uh mention certain measures they take to conserve the environment or to control environmental problems What are they
<$B> Uh there are some individuals who you know when we are talking about these problems but uh they were not universal They are people who really benefited from these programmes especially from uh uh Roman Catholic Mission from UUUHashi and from district council You find some individuals who have started uh UUUcentral conservation within their plots They are those who have uh decided to start agro-forestry on their personal plots and you'll find some who have decided to prepare these controls and what-not in RRRin the process of just trying to conserve the land from erosion And there are also some institution which decided to pick up from UUUHashi and started to mobilize again the people at the societal level And here I would like to cite an example of Mipa Catholic Mission in Mondo Division Uh this church there are two padres there who are Sokumas but not from that area but after seeing that problem they decided to mobilize these people and for them first they used uh these used clothes <ea/>mitumba So after some time that thing became internalized in them and uh in fact it is a very successful project which is co-owned or co-managed by the church and the village government Uh out of that conserved area the villages managed to purchase uh a milling machine from the village for that solving another problem which we are facing uh the people there because they didn't have a milling machine before and now they are trying to solve water problem by creating a dam because they have a season uh RRRseason river which passes through their village but unfortunately it is dry during the dry season So they were mobilizing the mission was trying to mobilize some funds because it is very expensive to build a dam to get some external sources of funding so that they can establish that uh dam So so far you find that there are some  institution><+_institutions> which have decided to take up these issues from these technical people and some individuals also who have decided again to RRRto solve this environmental problem on the family level So this is what we discovered 
<$C> These are your personal efforts Ave Maria but I would now like to know what are your recommendation as far as environmental problems are concerned
<$B> Uh what we recommended even for that very SHISCAP project first of all we said people's participation was very crucial Uh we said first those people who were involved in those projects should go and see traditionally how these people were managing their environment because when we were there people were talking about some other methodology whereby they used to RRRto conserve the land to conserve the soil So I think it was unfair for somebody just to come and say you have to introduce a UUUcentral conservation you have to plant maybe lucina or what So you said maybe go back to the people discuss with them about their  method><+_methods> and then try to improve on them That was first Secondly it is the type of trees to be planted Many people there were reserved in fact about the type of trees which were provided by these environmentalists For them they would prefer traditional trees which uh commonly and have wider use So for them this lucina was really very not very uh RRRvery good for them but uh they wanted eucalyptus and what these trees which can produce maybe timber uh which can provide fodder for their animals something like that but I don't know what was their reservation about lucina but they were really against lucina Uh another thing which we proposed again is that uh for water sources maybe it is better to go back again and reintroduce the UUUmelanpo because it is very difficult to separate Sokuma from uh his or her <O/> So always when we were talking about Sokuma we are talking about him her and her <O/> So to us for us we propose that maybe the UUUmelanpo system be reintroduced in the village so that they can manage to participate because up to now you find that during the dry season young men migrate with the cattle southwards to go and look for pasture there while here now are left back women and old people So this is really another problem because you know the family is not together throughout the year So that was uh another recommendation which we proposed And again thirdly we said that there was a need to coordinate these environmental management uh projects and for us we said since UUUHashi was farther than Shinyanga it was best because it was in the position in fact if empowered it is in a position to coordinate even this church organization or whatever because for the IIIper they started I think they were on the right track provided that they are given some uh RRRsome uh powers IIIeconomic economically empowered at least to carry out their activities because they were really constrained in terms of resources Even the district council uh they couldn't do much because the district forest officer I think natural resource officer had a motorcycle while those in the division had bicycles which is really cannot manage the harsh condition of Shinyanga So those were some of the  proposition><+_propositions> which we made and because others were very specific to SHISCAP project
<$C> I have another interesting question Ave You know that whenever you do a research you have hopes of a possible solution to the problem Uh now how did you manage to convince people in Shinyanga that their problems are getting to be solved soon
<$B> In fact uh during that research we were doing both uh sensitization and research So during our research we used also to try and educate them the importance of having those projects like UUUHashi within their locality and uh the importance of them IIIparticip their participation fully because we said these people of UUUHashi you are just blaming them for nothing because first of all they are not Sokumas Their region doesn't have this desertification problem They are here to assist you so unless you cooperate if you think this methodology is not good for you sit down and discuss with them but not to start sabotaging In fact if you are sabotaging a IIIpro RRRa programme it means you are just sabotaging your development So we used to go and campaign like that So for us we think that people's participation is more crucial and nobody can go and solve the problem of uh environment in Shinyanga except for Shinyanga people themselves Others will just come to assist and give them direction but the problem will be solved by themselves So this is what we used to campaign to them and in fact for these few who have decided to take up this environmental management on their family level we decided to take them as an example in fact Even during our dissemination seminar we invited them and they gave their personal you know views So it was really of help because they say ha so this is my colleague he's my neighbour and he's doing wonderful things to solve his or her problem Why not me
