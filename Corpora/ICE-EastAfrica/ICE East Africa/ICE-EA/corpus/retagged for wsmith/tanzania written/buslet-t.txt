Dear Sirs,
The writeup is developing well. I have made remarks to solicit reaction where I feel you should be able to produce substantiation otherwise reword to show that you may be persuaded by another slant if more data and information were produced.
In some areas I have queried because what I am supposed to castigate is what I am doing. The mid-way position is to state both options and to reflect that the project has presented an alternative approach which if given a chance would enable Tanzania to pursue the development of this sector with a much broader range of options. This is definitely not exhaustive but we ought to work . 
Yours faithfully,

Re Apple Mango Seedlings
I am writing in response to Dr <name/>'s fax of 19th February 1996. We are pleased that Dr <name/> can support us in finding the mango seedlings. We respond below to his questions:
- The mango trees we are looking for are to be interplanted with other crops; usually annual crops such as maize, beans and groundnuts. We also have other trees including citrus and bananas.
All the farmers who will get these seedlings have already planted mangoes. The varieties planted include Tommy Artkins and local varieties (Dodo, Boribo, Mviringo etc).
We do not have nurseries, the Tommy Artkins we obtain from the Tanga Region Integrated Project which was funded by GTZ. The local varieties we usually obtain seedlings that have germinated on their own in the fields or in compounds.
The objective of growing these apple mangoes is for consumption and selling to local markets with increase volumes , we will be looking for regional and export markets in Europe and Middle East.
So far, we are a group of 25 farmers from Mwanga District, who are looking for these seedlings. Our district already has a GTZ forestry project. This project has nurseries which are run by local farmers. It is therefore feasible to have a base on which to  built> a capacity to *propergate> more mango seedling . If this is done, more farmers will take up the seedlings.
There are potentials for grafting the apple mango varieties with local mangoes. What is missing is the *know how>. Mwanga District is already *propergating> grafted citrus fruits; oranges and tangerines. With guidance, we can transfer this  know how> to our district. If it is possible we can send farmers to Kenya to learn this technique.
The Tommy Artkins that I am growing are in Dar es Salaam. They were grafted at Tanga. I have also over 700 citrus trees which were all grafted, which I am interplanting with coconuts. I will be more than pleased to show you my farm. I have recently introduced bees to my fruit farm, and they complement each other. I have grown my fruit trees in a natural way. I do not use chemical fertilizers nor chemicals.
If the seedlings are readily available, we would take them anytime now because our long rain season is about to start. I hope you will find the above response adequate for your response to Dr. <name/>.
P.S. We heard of the apple mangoes from farmers in Taveta, which is very close to our district, Mwanga. If the seedlings can be obtained from there we could easily arrange to collect them. Since Mr Toroka contacted you, we have been talking to other farmers who are also very keen to have these varieties. Based on the numbers mentioned, we can take up to 1000 seedlings.
Yours sincerely,

We wish to correct a statement which states that IPI was established in 1989. In fact, IPI was established in 1983 and not in 1989 under order, made under section 21(4) of the University of Dar es Salaam Act, of 1970 and subsequently published on 6th October, 1989 in the Government Notice No. 326.
We are sorry for the inconvenience caused by that error.

RE: GERMANY- TANZANIA GOVT. NEGOTIATIONS - JUNE 1994
The letter with Ref. <number/> dated 16th June, 1994 on the above subject refers . We have received the said summary.
May I draw your attention to para 5.1.6 concerning the current and future status of I.P.I. This Institute as you may be aware, was established in 1989 under order, made under Section 21(4) of the University of Dar es Salaam Act, of 1970 and subsequently published on 6th October, 1989 in Government Notice No.326.
According to the agreement and regulations for the establishment of IPI, its aims and objectives are defined as follows:-
"The Institute shall be a link between the FoE and Tanzanian industry in order to foster the mutual utilization of knowledge and facilities.
The three main objectives are:-
(a) Product innovation up to prototype production and subsequent transfer to a suitable industry.
(b) Consultancy and services to industry.
(c) The Institute will supply curriculum advice to the FoE through its feedback from industry.
Close cooperation between the IPI and the FoE is presumed in all the above mentioned aspects but individual technical developments on either side shall not be excluded.
A recent valuation report (April 1993 - Feb. 1994) sponsored by GTZ, on the Reorientation of IPI it was revealed that the IPI had had same problem like most of R & Ds in this country because "transfer of local R & D results to industry had not been achieved," at the same , however, the evaluation team identified some encouraging factors and development, leading them to recommend to continue support for the project.
The Ministry is in full agreement with this stand, and has no *intetion> of *disolving> the IPI. Indeed, *intergrating> IPI premises and equipment into the Faculty of Engineering would be contrary to the spirit of the order which created the IPI as well as the Ministry's Sector Policy Paper which has identified some of these institutes for promotion into Centres of Basic Research or even Centres of excellence.
I tend to believe that our delegation did not have these important data at their disposal, hence the suggestion "to look into the possibilities of *intergrating> IPI into the Faculty of engineering. This would not be in the interest of the Mission of the University.

Dear Mr <name/>
Thank you for inviting me to the SECAP Steering Committee meeting of 3rd August, 1995. Unfortunately I received the letter on 7/08/1995; sorry I could not attend.
Meanwhile, having gone through the minutes of the 63rd Committee-Meeting of 12th April, 1995, some of the issues discussed are of particular concern to this Office; I would like to comment on a few as follows:-
THE FUTURE OF LIVESTOCK QUARANTINE STATION:
It is true that the R.D.D's Office would not support (financially or otherwise) the running of this station as a Government Service/or project component. However; in case SECAP would like to dispose it, the station should be handed-over to the Lusboto District Council. It will be up to the Council to decide whether to continue running it as part of its livestock development strategy or privatize the station. A copy of the handing-over protocol should be submitted to the Regional Development Director.
HANDING-OVER OF VEHICLES:
Last year, SECAP under the direction of its Steering Committee handed-over a number of motor-cycles to employees including those outside Government departments; this became an issue of contention between SECAP and this Office. (Ref. our letter <number/> of 4th May, 1994). I would like to advise that, disposal of vehicles no longer required by the project should follow procedures as laid down in R.D.D's letter Ref. No: <number/> of 1st March, 1995/ 
GENERAL ISSUES:
- Under the project agreement concluded on 3rd March, 1994 between F.R.G. and Tanzania Government, The Regional Development Director, Tanga, is charged with the responsibility of implementing the project on behalf of the recipient government. Surprisingly, for years, The R.D.D. (or representative) has not been a member of the Project Steering Committee. It is therefore logical that the composition of the Steering Committee should be revised.
- Since the Original Project concept (agro-silvo-pastoral-concept) was devised in the 1980's with its accompanying implementation strategies (extension services, self-help, community participation, village based entry point, etc) several social, economic and political changes have taken place particularly in terms national policy direction.
Having implemented the project for more than 10 years, and taking into consideration the current policy changes; it becomes *neccessary> to revisit the project concept and its strategies in their totality, so as to determine an appropriate future direction. Making adjustments in piece-meal may not be ideal. (For example the selling of tree seedlings as a measure of policy on cost-recovery makes it *neccessary> to review and reformulate project objectives, target groups, etc).
Yours Sincerely,
<name/>

RE: REGISTRATION OF MEDIUM DOCTORS SECONDED TO GTZ - PROJECTS AS PROJECT ASSISTANTS ADVISORS ON PUBLIC HEALTH, OR PROJECT COORDINATORS
Reference is made to your letter No. <number/> of 22nd November 1994 regarding the above subject.
I would like to let you know that the task of the Medical Council in this respect is to register and regulate the conduct of Medical Practitioners who have been earmarked to render services as Medical Practitioners to named Medical Institutions in the Country. This is in accordance with the provisions of section 15A of the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Ordinance Cap 409 of the Laws of the land.
For this reason if the practitioners in question are NOT at all going to practise the Medical Profession in the Country, in the course of executing their daily activities then they need not be registered.
I hope this clarification will guide you accordingly.

RE: SPECIAL PROGRAMME FOR REHABILITATION OF AREAS IN TANZANIA AFFECTED BY THE RWANDAN REFUGEE INFLUX - ENVIRONMENT COMPONENT EDF ACCOUNT NO. <number/>
Thank you for a copy of your letter addressed to GTZ - Germany, ref No. <number/>, dated 4/9/95 concerning the above mentioned topic.
We have gone through the letter and the revised document proposal and noted, as you observed, it is true that a complete overview of the project is required in the areas you mentioned before final agreement is made.
We all know that we are dealing with an emergency situation and not a normal development Programme. Due to pressure from refugees and the local community the environment is grossly damaged. Without immediate intervention there is a danger of having the problem much pronounced and more difficult to address. We, therefore, believe that GTZ-HQ will respond soon and avoid delayed implementation of this crucial programme.
Last but not least we feel that it is important to involve/incorporate the Refugee Affected Areas Rehabilitation Coordination Unit (Prime Minister's Office) in all discussions and implementation of this programme. This will among other things ensure smooth coordination and avoid duplication of assistance extended to the refugees affected areas.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Yours sincerely,

Dear Sirs,
SPECIAL PROGRAMME FOR REHABILITATION OF AREAS IN TANZANIA AFFECTED BY THE RWANDAN REFUGEE INFLUX - ENVIRONMENTAL COMPONENT EDF ACCOUNT NO. <number/>
We acknowledge receipt of your proposal of 21.07.95 (ref. <number/>) for EU contribution to the above captioned project in a co-financing arrangement with the German Government (BMZ).
During discussions of the proposal with your local office in Dar es Salaam on 31.08.95 (<name/>/<name/>) we have been asked to confirm that the EU contribution is available. We can indeed confirm that The Special Rehabilitation Programme referred to has been allocated an amount of ECU 3,000,000 from the 7th European Development Fund under account no. <number/>, of which ECU 800,000 has been earmarked for the Environmental Component. The Financing Agreement for the Programme was signed by the European Commission and the United Republic of Tanzania in March 1995 and disbursement on other components of the Programme have started in June . The Financing Agreement stipulates that implementation of the Environmental Component will take place through GTZ. All the funds are therefore available for start of contractual procedures.
Before such procedures can start we need, however, some further information on the total project for co-financing. Your proposal of 21.07.95 does not give a complete overview of the project. In particular the budget is deficient as it only presents details of what the EU should contribute and no *deatils> at all are given as to the estimate of the assumed Government contribution of DM 150,000 (page 21). We would at least expect to receive an updated Project Planning Matrix (logical framework) as well as a related, complete and detailed budget with financing plan (BMZ/GTZ,EU, Government of Tanzania). The format used in the Project Appraisal Report of March 1995 (annexes 6 & 7) would be appropriate.
As regards your Financial Proposal, we cannot make any final comments until the missing information referred to above has been received. We have two points, however, to make at this stage. Firstly, we will have to investigate internally if it is acceptable and advantageous to include the entire EDF contribution in one service contract. It may be necessary to contract overseas equipment supplies and local operating costs/purchases separately. Secondly, we believe that periodic evaluation shall be contracted separately with an independent consultant.
We hope that this information will help you to make further progress in preparation of the project as we would like to see the assistance to the refugee affected areas becoming effective without delay.
Yours faithfully,
<name/>

RE: CDP I FOLLOW UP
You may recall that when were in Sweden last August 1990, each *on> of us who attended CDP submitted his/her Plan of Action. All Plans of Action were jointly discussed. Strong and weak areas of each individual Plan of Action were pointed out, and the Managing Director concerned were asked to make necessary adjustments.
Your Plan of Action formed some sort of a Social Contract between the trainers and you against which the performance of your company, and consequently the effect of CDP could be evaluated. Evaluation of this becomes very important especially if we take into account that you seriously recommended a second CDP.
This is the 5th month since the last session of CDP in Sweden. It is our considered opinion that 5 months is a period long enough to start assessing the impact of CDP.
In light of this, I an dispatching my Secretary to deliver on your desk CDP I - FOLLOW UP FORM. Information will not be revealed to any other party without your permission.
May I also take this opportunity to remind each one of us that our Shadow Board Meetings should continue as earlier agreed. Minutes of these Shadow Boards Meetings need to be kept by Secretaries. A copy should be mailed to SICATA.
CPD I - FOLLOW UP FORM is expected in this office a week from the time you receive it.

SEWYADDP is MERDA Programme started in the early 1994. Its direction is towards the total liberation of Women and Youth from all kinds of *appression> and exploitation based on race, class, sex etc. It drums up awareness issues, meet about them, and act on them, to help *cr-eate> or support relevant services to *need full> Women, to do all these things is for the empowerment of Women without leaving the Youth and children behind.
One of our centred priorities for the year 2,000 and beyond is at least 30% of jobless Youths and Women to have employment opportunities
The majority of men and women in Tanzania depend on Agriculture for their *life hood>. But because of the scarcity annual rainfall, even non-drought year the people could find employment for only few months of the year. To add to these problems, the system of *inkind> payment resulted in a severe shortage of cash so essential in *to days> rural economy.

Among the items to the dealt with is the review of the *Committments> made during the Pre-Dakar Workshop and at the final meeting of TANGO's participants in Dakar.
We shall also work on concrete follow up actions on the critical areas concern identified in Dakar Platform.
Another activity will be to get reports on the Copenhagen meeting on social Development and the New *Yourk> Preparatory Committee for the Beijing NGO Forum and Conference on Women.
I hope you will be able to spare some time to attend this workshop which will draw participants *fro> the NGO community and CBO's and the participants who had the opportunity to go to Dakar. We are looking forward to your cooperation in this matter.
Yours Sincerely

RE: PROJECTS LIST BY TANGO (WID) POST DAKAR // BEIJING PROCESS
In reference to the discussions held at the Royal Netherlands Embassy premises on March 29th 1995, I wish to submit to you the List of Planned Activities to be supervised by TANGO WID.
I am also enclosing the complete proposal by TANGO regarding the participants of the forthcoming NGO Forum and 4th World Conference on Women in Beijing China. We have tried to *categense> the people already as we have received and submitted the Registration Forms.
We shall appreciate to get from you the number of people you are ready to sponsor. Although the list of names is more than 40, we are requesting funds for 40 participants because about 6 people in the list have already secured funding since 1994.
We are now finalising the remaining proposals and we shall send to you within a week from now. We hope you will consider our requests positively.

RE: REQUEST FOR SUPPORT TO TAKE OVER TANZANIA PUBLISHING HOUSE
We have the honour to approach you with a request for loan/grant financing to facilitate a management and employee take over of Tanzania Publishing House Limited (THP).
THP is a small size state owned enterprise (SOE) operating in the paper conversion sector. It has a current labour force of 26 people including the management. The government holds 100% of its shares through the Tanzania Karatasi Associated Industries (TKAI), the government holding corporation in the paper sector.
THP's mission and objective is the promotion of the indigenous publishing industry through publication of a wide variety of books and reading materials focusing particularly on textbooks, reference and general books. TPH is the leading local publishing house with publishing rights of over 300 titles in both English and Swahili. TPH is also one of the designated publishers for the Ministry of Education and Culture of a number of Primary and Secondary school textbooks.
The ongoing implementation of the divestiture of State Owned Enterprises also affects TPH. The company is envisaged as a good candidate for divestiture through a Management and Employee Buy Out (MEBO) scheme by virtue of its small size and the fact that its major productive assets are intangible and are constituted by its employees.
The management and employees have prepared and presented a MEBO proposal to the Presidential Parastatal Sector Reform Commission (PSRC). The proposal is concretised by a seven year business plan (1995-2001) which has an appropriate financial analysis and a sensitivity analysis too. (A copy of the proposal is available on request).
We are glad to inform you that this MEBO proposal has been accepted by PSRC. The price of the company has also been accepted at TShs. 71 million. Consequently, PSRC has demanded to be furnished with written evidence, before January 31, 1995, of our ability either to pay the intended cash or to borrow the necessary funds as of the target acquisition of 51% (i.e. TShs.36 million) of the shares of the company.
The management and employees are eager to contribute some of their meagre benefits to raise a portion of the purchase price. Such a contribution, while amounting to considerable sacrifice on the employees' part, will really only constitute a token sum of the requirement, bearing in mind the prevailing salary structures. It is in this regard that we are now approaching you for your support, through provision of loan or grant financing of the MEBO scheme. The amount being sought is in the range of TShs. 20 million to TShs. 30 million.
You may also wish to know that as of present TPH is free from any encumbrances arising out of debt financing. It has, though, a low level of liabilities arising out of normal trade debts such as credit facilities extended by its business associates.
We shall be grateful to receive your tentative response with indications of your preliminary feelings on this request. Moreover, we are looking forward to your cooperation with the management and employees of TPH in this scheme.
Please feel free to ask for any information deemed necessary to facilitate your decision making.
We wish you a prosperous and peaceful 1995.
Sincerely,
<name/>

Dear Sir, 
Request for assistance to manage conducting democratization seminars:
As you well know that, Tanzania is going to have a general election next year. This will be the first time this country has conducted such elections under pluralism. Up to now most Tanzanians do not *differentiat> between the ruling and the government.
The government has not shown any positive action in educating the people especially the rural Swahili speaking population who comprise the most of the  electorates><+_electorate>. The leaders of government and the CCM leaders have been going around the Country telling the people that joining other political Parties equals to treason. On the part of the Opposition Parties, they *dont> have resources to reach the people. It is therefore very important to have a countrywide democratization seminars and this can be done by committed Civil Societies of which TAHURET is one.
TAHURET is a registered NGO with the aim of human rights education and Justice Protection. Since then we have been using the "Political Platform" in educating our people to understand their rights. Also, the Chairman has, on several *occations> been used by one NGO to conduct seminars on democratization.
TAHURET has qualified personnel to involve in the democratization process. We are sending this request to consider funding us so that we can conduct several seminars. I am ready to come for more details at your *convinience>.

URT/94/003 - National Income Generation Programme Meeting of NGOs
As you may be aware, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Tanzania has initiated a multi-donor, multi-million dollar programme for income generation and creation of employment. This initiative is known as the National Income Generation Programme (NIGP).
In November 1993 a donors' conference was hosted by the Government of Tanzania to launch the NIGP. Since the conference, the NIGP has become operational, a board of directors has been selected and an Executive Director has been recruited. One of the main partners of programme implementation will be Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).
We plan to hold a meeting of key international and local NGOs in late October to discuss areas of common interest and how partnerships could be forged. A very preliminary agenda for this meeting is enclosed for your comments and suggestions. We would appreciate receiving your comments early so that an invitation to the meeting with the finalized agenda could be sent to you.

Re: Sponsorship for a working trip
With the exception of the pursuit of peace, there is no cause with which the United Nations is more closely identified than the cause of human rights.
UN actions in the field of human rights have, throughout the World, saved lives of people, children included, prevented torture, won the release of prisoners, brought about the reappearance of "disappeared" persons, promoted health and literacy and protected the rights of refugees and displaced persons.
To strengthen their deep commitment to the cause of human dignity, the world conference on Human Rights will take place in Vienna in June this year (1993) at the invitation of the government of Austria.
I have been selected to cover the conference for Business Times and later on use my enrichment of human rights issues which also involve the welfare of children to write more when I am back again.
The objectives of the Vienna conference include the *reviewal> of progresses made in the filed of human rights since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 and to examine the link between development and the employment of economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights.
According to the tentative programme for the Vienna conference the issue of human rights and the girl child will also be seriously focused.
I have been following UNICEF efforts since years back and this conference in Vienna will enrich my interest in children particularly their welfare and using my enrichment I will write much on my return for the advancement of their welfare.
My request to your good office is to sponsor me for my air ticket to and from Vienna, my hotel accommodation and my per diem.
Business Times is also working hard to secure a sponsor for my trip as everything is supposed to be settled soonest.

Re: Introducing the Tanzania Youth Development and Employment Foundation (T.Y.D.E.F.)
Please refer to the above-mentioned subject matter.
On behalf of the Board of Trustees I have the Honour of introducing the Tanzania Youth Development and Employment Foundation (T.Y.D.E.F.).
Since its inception (1987) the Tanzania Youth Development and Employment Foundation (TYDEF) has ignited the imagination of a great many people at grassroot levels in the informal sector in D'Salaam region who have registered with us over 900 (nine hundred groups) of five to ten members per enterprise making an average of 6,000 (six thousand) people. Still more are coming.
The Tanzania Youth Development and Employment Foundation (TYDEF) last year managed to secure UNDP funded assistance to the tune of US $ 503,000 geared towards TYDEF institutional building with ILO as the Executing Agency.
Fortunately after securing the *finacial> Assistance from the UNDP; though the Project Document provided for a two year period of project activities before handing over to TYDEF at a Tripartite Meeting between UNDP/ILO/The Government and TYDEF held on the 18th February 1993 changes were made and it was resolved that:
(a) A technical Assessment team be assembled within three months after the Tripartite meeting to study TYDEF Administrative and Management capacity with a view of handing over Project activities to TYDEF. Modalities towards assembling the Technical Team to carry out the work would be the responsibility of the UNDP and ILO.
(b) TYDEF should raise the 5.0 million shillings required to cover local costs in the final year of the project.
For us TYDEF this is a very positive response from our Donor and we feel an obligation of meeting the local costs component and experience has taught us that whenever we request assistance from friendly Governments and whenever there is an objective reasoning for it we do meet receptive ears .
Since our request would reflect concrete *acheivement> of the grassroot itself of which we are a sensitising organ I hope we won't have gone very far when we request assistance of at least a half *forthe> 5 million shillings earmarked.
We would also be greatly honoured Sir, if you would accept an invitation from us at your *conviniency> so that you meet with TYDEF members scattered all over Dar es Salaam Region.
Thank you.

Your manuscript on "FAMILIA NDOGO KWA MAISHA MAZURI" refers .
I have read it during this weekend with great interest and found it to be an excellent publication. Congratulations for this initiative.
The publication will educate the *indented> readers on the very important and timely health issue in respect to the population problems which are, a national concern.
*Commending> on content of the manuscript, it is written in a fairly simple language and drawings which together make the book easy to read and understand by any person without much formal education. I find it to be resourceful educational materials to members of families, community leaders, primary health care meetings extension workers and in particular the teachers in all schools and public in general. I however, suggest that the title of this book need to be improved or changed to a more comprehensive one with an attractive illustration. I am trying to think of one which I will communicate to you later.
Lastly I take this opportunity to reiterate the support of our Institution to your endeavours through the programme of "Facts for Life" which is an attempt to ensure that the most recent and relevant knowledge and experiences are being applied in the people's efforts to control some of the most serious public health problems in Tanzania.

Tanzania Gender Networking Programme seminar series - Beijing feedback - 7 October 1995 (Saturday)
Tanzania Gender Networking Programme participated in the just ended UN World Conference on Women in Beijing '95. On 27/9/95, as part of TGNP Wednesday Gender and Development Seminar series, TGNP delegates to Beijing Conference organized a feedback seminar at its offices along Azikiwe Street, CRDB building (opposite New Post Office). The seminar was attended by about 70 people. A high level of participation took place in the discussions which followed the presentations, but time was too short to cover all the issues and plan action. People felt the need for more publicity, partly to counteract the largely indifferent and, sometimes negative reporting about Beijing in local and international media.
A request was put forward that TGNP organize a similar event for a whole day with a wider coverage and a larger audience and to specifically focus on action oriented programmes with follow-up activities among TGNP networkers and other NGOs. The above *mentionfirmed> for the seminar is Saturday 7 October 1995.
TGNP would feel very honoured to have your presence and participation at the above-mentioned seminar which will be held at the British Council from 8.30 a.m. to 3.00 p.m. Soda and bites will be provided.
The objective of the workshop are as follows:-
1. Dissemination of information in detail regarding decisions made in Beijing.
2. Suggestions regarding different steps taken by organizations, for the Beijing plan of action.
3. To arrange for plan of action.
4. Feedback on the media coverage
We are looking forward to your participation.

- to urge the community to use their rights by voting for an appropriate leader who meets stipulated leadership qualities
- to remind the community that this is the International year for Peace and Tolerance
- and finally to avail space for women going to Beijing China to show in clear terms what our mission is.

Re: Production of voter education materials with a gender perspective; 9th-10th June 1995, Mbagala Spiritual Centre
As an Organization, Tanzania Gender Networking Programme (TGNP) feels that, while much is being done to educate voters at present, a gender perspective is conspicuous by its absence. In addition we feel that we are not listening enough to the voters themselves.
Therefore, we are pleased to invite you to a two day Voter Education Workshop in order to identify the specific issues that need to be addressed and make a start on production of the materials so that they can be produced and used in the community as a starting point for further dialogue and mutual education.
Issues will focus interest groups eg.
-Youth,
- Rural Women,
- Informal Sector,
- Workers etc.
Specifically to assist women voters and the voted to actively participate in politics and raise concern over development issues.
Attached please find TGNP-brochure, a list of invited participants and a registration form  of> which we request you to fill and return to the Workshop Organizer TGNP.
Your input in the production of voter materials with a gender perspective is highly valuable.
Sincerely Yours,
<name/>

Re: Report by TGNP on a study tour to Germany 17th-26th April 1995
The purpose of this letter is to express our appreciation, for according us this unique experience to exchange notes with like minded groups and institutions in Germany and to submit a report of the tour.
In all the places we visited, our hosts were well prepared to share with us, information about the status of Women in Germany and were keen also to learn about the situation of women in Tanzania.
We have learned *alot> in terms of *lobbing> *techiniques>, how to use pressure during advocacy work, and also how to diversify activities so as to reach more target groups.
We do hope some of the sisters and brothers we visited will get a chance to visit us as well, so that they can meet more groups and build even a more wider network.
We cannot thank you enough, but know that the experience we got will be put in good use.

Request for funding nine people from TNGP, TAALUMA Women 
<O/> Women Association to participate in the Dakar regional preparatory conference 
November, 1994 and the 4th World Conference on Women September, 1995
We have the honour to express our appreciation for the financial assistance KAF has offered to fund activities in the above mentioned organisations. You will be pleased to know that these three *NGO's> have taken an active part in the preparation process of the NGO Country Report for the Dakar and Beijing Conferences. Two of the three Organisations are coordinating validation *reseach> and Zonal workshops in order to finalise the national NGO report. The draft report was launched on 25th June, 1994. The Tanzania Association of *NGO's> is coordinating the preparation of the report.
During the preparation process as well as at the launching programme, most donors have pledged to support the preparation of the report and the process of empowering women and transforming society in Tanzania. However funding is only available for a few people to attend the Dakar and Beijing Conferences. We in the three NGOs whose activities KAF is sponsoring are convinced that it will enrich our capacity to organise and network if at least three people from each NGO are given the opportunity to participate at the Dakar Regional preparatory Conference scheduled for Nov, 1994 as well as the 4th World Conference on Women, Beijing 1995. We will be able to make a valuable contribution to the proceedings as a result of our participation in preparatory activities in Tanzania. The experiences we acquire through participation in the two conferences will trickle down to the grassroots through our outreach programmes, Gender sensitisation seminars and others.
It is in this spirit that we come to KAF with this request. Below are the budget lines.
Thank you in advance for considering our request fully or partly.

RE: AN ASSESSMENT ON TANDIKA'S *TALNSLATION> OF <foreign_>"SPRACHE GESELSCHAFT UND KOMMNIKATION<foreign/> IN AFRICA" BY B. HEINE
I have the honour to respond to the request, assumingly yours, that I should give you an *assesment> report on the above.
I do not read nor speak German. But I have read Mr. Tandika's text thoroughly well. My reaction includes the following points.
General:
Kiswahili as a Tanzanian language is very well established, from the grassroots to top academic as well as political leaders.
As an African language, East, central and Southern Africa is very well covered by Kiswahili. There is no country in this zone that users of the language can be absent. The Somalia, Ethiopia and Sudanese zone, partly East African, partly northern and practically one of its own, also teaches and uses Kiswahili. In Egypt, they teach it at University level and announce it in their RADIO. In West Africa they teach it in Ghana, Nigeria and little of it in Guinea.
Obviously, Kiswahili has developed as one of world languages.
Its significance is both academic and social. It has a natural Force which attracts various people to learn it.
This translation:
Translation of one language into another, always opens up new revenues. New concepts, words, expressions etc. are brought into being. Ideas are shared and relations established. Translation is one big way of bringing about educational growth of a nation or of a people. At the present stage of the history of Kiswahili, at which modern science and *etechnology> take their rightful places, translation of academic books is essentially useful and very instrumental in bringing about the necessary changes.
I have noted with interest the coverage that Tandika's translation has: Official and national languages classification of countries based on languages, Language and politics, Dialects and Languages Planning, Language and Society, problems of standardization, Africa and its languages - Kiswahili, Husa, Mandingo; Ethnicity and Language and Expectation that book offers etc.
These are very relevant topics of discussion both in academic circles as well as in social political groups.
At our Institute of Kiswahili Research, we have just started serious work on dialectology and there is a very not discussion going on about the real Mswahili and her language Kiswahili. In Africa, we are still very divided due to language differences and linguistic attitudes. No body can deny this fact that this translation has some answers to these questions. The title itself as Tandika suggests, LUGHA, JAMII NA MAWASILIANO AFRICA offers attraction, logic and understanding of our major problems in language planning and developments.
Kiswahili has borrowed German expressions and concepts in this translation for example <ea_>lugha inayotumika na wengi<ea/> instead of our old <ea_>lugha ya kati<ea/> for lingua franca.
Possible Users
The Ministry of Education is the only organ in Tanzania which recommends books to be used at specific levels of its students. As it is, it is a book which interests general readers whose number can be estimated at ten to twenty thousand copies. For schools, it fits into secondary, colleges and the University. For this another twenty thousand would be the minimum. Let ten other thousands be for our neighbourly readers in Kenya, Burundi and Rwanda.
The sponsor should pay for the publication of the book so that the buying price remains at a subsidy.
Conclusion
Tanzania is now very bad in need of good books. This translation is one of the on-going efforts to fill the gap. It is my sincere hope that this translation shall be published accordingly and immediately. <name/> of the Institute of Kiswahili Research can check the perfection of the translation (if it has not been done) and <name/> of BAKITA can quickly and well enough edit the manuscript for publication.
This exercise shall prove positively towards developing kiswahili which is your rightful offer to Tanzanian's cultural growth and Development.

Dear Mr. <name/>
First of all I would like to thank you for the Second time, for you made me able to attend the seminar which was conducted at Ardhi Institute recently. Secondly I hope you're fine and *definately> you received the ticket which I posted to you after arriving at Morogoro.
True speaking my Municipal Director was very delighted when I handed over the handouts of the seminar and our resolutions which he said were of the beneficial to our Council as well as Local *Goverments> are Concerned.
Mr. <name/> it is time now I would like to present a request *sothat> you may consider me for a short course on waste management and sanitation anywhere. I have already applied to the Centre for Housing Studies Rotterdam and they accepted to admit me for a six months course but unfortunately there was no sponsor. May be your Institute can do some help to me or otherwise you can ask some other firms which could assist me on that matter. I am really happy the way you have been very much kind to me that you invited and assisted me in three Consecutive Seminars there at DSM it is really wonderful. I hope in Federal Republic of Germany there might be some firms which are ready to sponsor such short courses but, they have not been contacted, so through your firm may be I would get a help although if not in Rotterdam may be at any place where such course can be conducted*.
International Course on Water Supply 
(b) Low Cost Sanitation Course (Held at Centre for Housing studies Ardhi DSM-1984 (4 months)
(c) Seminar on selected Industries Morogoro/DSM on waste pollution 1986. (3 weeks)
(d) Seminar on waste management Ardhi Institute 1989 1 week.
(e) Follow up of the above Seminar Ardhi Institute 1991 1 week.
Lastly I beg you to put your effort so that I succeed to get one to sponsor the course.
I hope to get an answer soon.

Dear Mr. <name/>
<ea_>ANICET KITEREZA<ea/>-(1896-1981.
Thank you very much for your kind letter of invitation.
I must admit that I have been away for a very long time, probably ran away from your office. I was always thinking of paying a visit to your office, but time never allowed me to do so.
As soon as I received the money from your Embassy through your kind efforts I started to roll about here and there. I managed to travel up to Winde an old Sea side town, very historic which lies between Bagamoyo and Saadan where I had to do a bit of research.
I returned here and began to decipher some very old  informations><+_information>. My work seems to be progressing well and I am happy at this moment to say that I have about 3,000 main entries and about 1,800 sub entries while my Data Bank is still rich about one half of the total number already *sloted> in.
However it is too early now to predict its expected figure, but I will be able to do so as soon as I get the writing Cards which I hope to secure some very soon. These will be about 10,000 which I hope they will suffice.
I am glad to tell you that I am now working on two projects at a time i. e. Cultural Dictionary and Etymology Dictionary based on Coastal towns and villages along the Tanzanian coast. The Etymo. has about 1,800 names of towns etc. with their very secret meaning.
As soon as I push them in hard Cards, I shall then be in possession to inform the Embassy about the progress of the work.
Thank you once again for all that you have done in this connection.
Hoping to see you at the Aniceti Kitereza's Exhibition.

Dear Sir, 
RE: ASSISTANCE FOR  EQUIPMENTS><+_EQUiPMENT> FOR DOCUMENTATION OF CULTURAL AND NATURAL HISTORY COLLECTIONS AT THE DAR ES SALAAM NATIONAL MUSEUM:
Because this is my first letter since our Zoologist Dr. <name/> completed his doctoral studies under The DAAD sponsorship, I wish fore-most, on behalf of the Board of Directors of the National Museum of Tanzania to thank the DAAD for the financial assistance which enabled Dr. <name/> to *persue> the studies at Humboldt University.
After his studies Dr. <name/> has been appointed Director of the Dar es Salaam National Museum and he is the Senior Scientist in the museums department of zoology, responsible for research and museum collection.
*Refering> now to the actual issue, I wish to forward the enclosed application for assistance in terms of provision of a computer, printer and a photocopying machine under the DAAD sponsored students. I am optimistic that the requested assistance will *greately> improve documentation systems at the Dar es Salaam National Museum and will enable Dr. <name/> and other fellow scientist to *performe> their research well.

Dear Sir,
RE: TEMPORARY ETHNOGRAPHIC EXHIBITION
Thank you very much for your message which reached me this morning about the above named exhibition. Fortunately, I am ready with the draft proposal for the seminar and temporary exhibition which I am attaching for your viewing before we meet.
As it can be seen, there is a lot of information gap in the proposed budget even after long discussions with the Museum Director. Worse still, it is the part which matters. The work on the show case kindly donated by you is going on and we hope it will be ready on time.
Please if it is convenient for you we can meet here or at your institute on Friday any time from 10.00 am. I am hopeful that I will get more help or suggestions on the issue.
As for the captions, me and my assistant are working on them, and on Friday I'll be in a position to suggest a possible date to start work with your librarian.
Again, thank you.
Yours faithfully,

Dear Mr. <name/>,
<foreign_>Vielen Dank<foreign/> for your letter of 13/1/1991. Unfortunately it arrived while I was on a month-long Safari, hence I could not reply in time.
Now, regarding your queries, and requests, I can only advise as follows:
1. I can send you my photo if you really need it TPH had a photo that I took together with the late <name/> in 1975. I do not know whether they still have it; I will contact them on the matter.
2. The most important 5 - 6 Tanzanian writers of this century, in my view, are:
 1. The late Shaaban Robert (died 1962)
 2. The late Mathias Mayampala (died 1969)
 3. The late M. S. Abdulla (died 20/2/1991)
 4. E. Kezilahabi (a relative of Kitereza) still writing
 5. Ebrahim Hussein (still writing)
 6. Penina Muhando (still writing).
I suggest that we get their photos for the exhibition. The cost of a good, framed photograph of each of the authors will be about T-Sh. 8000/=. Hence the cost of the 6 photos will be about 8000x6=48000/= (US $ 250/=).
3. Kitereza got his theological education at Rubya (Roman Catholic) Seminary in Bukoba, North-Western Tanzania. I have no *ducuments> or photos from that period and place. However, it may be necessary to send someone there to get them i. e. if we intend to have a really authentic exhibition. This may involve some costs (travelling, subsistence, *hotocopying>, etc.). *Alternatuvely>, one could request Rubya Seminary to supply the material gratis by post, hoping that they would oblige.
For all these reasons, this material cannot possibly be sent to you by the end of March.
4. Fr. <name/> from Canada was Kitereza's *acquintance>, and is said to have taken to Canada a typescript of the Kikerebe version of Kitereza's novel, hoping to find a publisher for it. Unfortunately, he died before he could get a publisher. That's all I could gather about him.
 Thats><+_That's> all for the time being. Sorry for the delay in answering. Please keep in touch. (Please note my correct address above).
Yours Sincerely,
<name/>

Re: Assistance for renovation of Kigamboni Primary School
Kigamboni Primary School is a very old school which was established by the Roman Catholic Missionaries in the 1940's.  It's>>+_Its> buildings, however have never been repaired ever since they were first constructed.
The school has a capacity for admitting 3,000 and more pupils every academic year. But due to the unconducive environment caused by the *dilapitated> buildings, the school fails to *accomodate> some of the pupils and for those *accomodated>, their performance has never been satisfactory.
To arrest this situation, the School *Commitee> has decided to seek material assistance from benevolent sources, including your institution.
According to project estimates already identified by the committee, an amount to the tune of Tshs.25,000,000.00 would be enough to cover fencing, renovation of office block and three classroom blocks.
So far the parents have contributed Tshs 2,000,000.00 and some labour for the project.
It is with this spirit of nation building that we bring *fourth> to you our request for your material/financial assistance.
We thank you in advance for your kind attention.

Dear <name/>,
You probably remember me. I am a lawyer - cum - journalist, who has maintained a weekly column in 'BUSINESS TIMES' since the Newspaper was born in November 1988. Through this column called 'WITH A LEGAL TOUCH' I have persistently crusaded for democracy and socio-economic reform in Tanzania. I was closely associated with the founding of the weekly and have remained a faithful supporter of its development.
Besides, I write another column in the same business weekly called 'TALKING BUSINESS' under a pen-name of Bob Wemu.
Sir, you may also like to know that I was a member of a committee of experts which planned the birth of THE BUSINESS newspaper in the city three years ago. My visible contribution to the paper is a weekly column called 'THE RULE OF LAW' in the SUNDAY EXPRESS.
To cap it all, I was recently appointed a columnist in a brand newcomer on the media horizon, THE EAST AFRICAN. This is a sister paper of DAILY NATION OF Kenya.
May I also mention in passing that I was last April appointed a member of the UN Observer Mission on the first democratic general elections of South Africa.
In August, I was privileged to be one of East African experts who discussed the revival of the EA Community at Conference held in Kampala, Uganda.
In short, I humbly and respectfully request you, Jorg, to support my burning desire to attend the forthcoming summit in Copenhagen. You could kindly pay for my return air - ticket and for my stay in the city during the important gathering. I firmly believe that my attendance and/or participation in the meeting will help broaden my orientation and improve my skills. It will hopefully open to me new ways of contributing to the war against poverty in Tanzania.
Please find enclosed some copies of my write-ups for your reference and a copy of the application form for media accreditation. My bio-data is also attached.

Dear Sir,
Re: Administration of Company Development Programme (CDP)
The subject above refers.
As it is known to each one of us, the implementation of each session of CDP is phased sequentially.
The first phase is class-work. This involves lecturing, followed by workshops. Lecturers are given by resource persons and they are very condensed. The purpose of such lectures is to provide participants with some analytical tools which they are made to apply immediately in diagnosing and x-raying the company of every participant when the participants have constituted themselves into a five member workshop group. Since there are twenty participants in the CDP, this means there are four workshops each consisting of five members. The workshops are conducted simultaneously, and they all focus on the same theme.
The other phase is the so-called shadow Board Meetings. This comes up after the first phase, that is, class-work has been completed. The five members who form one workshop during class-work, constitute themselves into Shadow Board members. Acting and behaving as real Board Members of the Company of every participant, the shadow Board members are required to analyse financial ratios, production/marketing matrix, strength and weakness of each Company, incentive package (motivation), time usage, competition, etc.
The *skillful> administration/co-ordination by SICATA of the two phases of each session in the CDP is of critical importance to the achievement of our (SICATA) objective - namely the transfer of technology (specifically soft-ware) which unquestionably is a vital factor of production.
In the light of the above it is obvious that after the IFL (Swedish Institute of Management) have completed their Contract, SICATA should necessarily proceed with the programme. For SICATA to be able to achieve this goal, inevitably we must actively participate in all the two phases of each session of the CDP. Where we are subjected to constraints such as shortage of manpower and or funds; the shadow Board Meetings should be scheduled in such a way that enables the programme coordinator to attend all the shadow board meetings. The reason for this being that at the end of CDP, the coordinator will be required to chair a Committee that will be encharged with the production of a hand-book to be used by SICATA. Guided by this, the following has been decided:-
(i) Mr. <name/> - who is the Programme Coordinator should attend all the Board Meetings: Arusha, and Moshi (...).
(ii) Mr. <name/> who travelled to Moshi for the purpose of attending the Board meeting instead of Mr. <name/> is returning to Dar es Salaam to participate in the Women's Workshop to be held at our Branch Office on ..
The per diem given to <name/> has been deposited at the Project Head Office and will be given to Mr. <name/> for the same purpose on arrival. Twenty thousand five hundred only (..) have been deposited.
(iii) Since the Women's Workshop required three participants from our office, Mr. <name/> who leaves Moshi on ... should join you at the Workshop.
(iv) While at the workshop, you are to lead our team and Mr. <name/> will act as your secretary; he should submit the report at the time to be prescribed by you.
(v) During the first CDP session, only three SICATA officials attended the two phases of session I. For reasons advanced earlier in this letter and also through telephone conversation between myself and yourself; it is proposed that Mr. <name/> should be included in the programme. This will make the number of SICATA officials to be four, thus enabling us to cover every Workshop. Bearing this in mind, the proposed budget should take care of Mr.<name/> .
Yours faithfully,
<name/>
