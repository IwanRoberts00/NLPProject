<$C> 
<$A> Why did you say that 
<$C> Uh

<$C> 
<$A> Uh 
<$C> That Kiswahili saying
<$A> Yeah 
<$C> That one I got through my experience
<$?> You are a geography teacher 
<$C> I had a geography teacher who when he uses uh one uh what do you call those things 
<$A> Uh
<$C> Those things
<$?> Proverbs
<$C> Those IIIma proverbs
<$A> Yeah
<$C> Then he just misplaces them
<$A> 
<$C> Like now let's say you go to Nairobi 
<$A> Yeah
<$C> And maybe you're messed up
<$?> There's not even a relevance
<$C> And it does not apply completely
<$A> Okay 
<$?> It's a very difficult one
<$?> We used to cram those things
<$?> Leave alone cramming Mulao and their explanations 
<$?> We actually We knew what they were the saying But you had to know the meaning
<$?> And even write a story about it 
<$?> You know uh You had to know you had to <ea/>jua 
<$A> Yeah they are very interesting
<$?> RRRmhm
<$?> 
<$?> 
<$A> Basic knowledge Knowledge for knowledge's sake It's true like 
<$?> But I think I think what we used to do in Seco We used to learn Here we are not learning Sure here <O/> your marks and you seriously here we're not learning
<$C> No RRRNo RRRNo But Uh uh Yeah No it is true 
<$?> No
<$C> The way I used to read in Seco me I used to read those things
<$?> Let me tell you Let me tell you why you're learning whatever you're learning 'Cause you RRRyou do something which really occupies your mind and you are really required a lot of thinking like accounts you ours it's <O/> <ea/>si I'll get this mark in this CAT or something RRRsomething like that Us we don't keep something in the head
<$C> Application us guys have to apply a lot
<$?> Us we have no continuation by the way 'cause it's like whatever you do this semester just ends 
<$?> Do you apply your GPA
<$?> Well maybe <O/> administration but that is for people who will be in those public offices
<$?> You are not going to be there
<$?> <ea/>Si I'm a counsellor
<$C> What grade do you 
<$?> you remember the <ea/>kanini you've just done now 
<$?> sexual harassment uh guys today the best topic that people would have wanted to go on until the end of the semester People have come up with their own ideas Lakini how can boys who've gone to school think like that Uh
<$?> What are they saying
<$C> What were they saying 
<$?> I mean there RRRthere are obvious things like for example this story of *provocativeness> or you are dressed provocatively You it keeps coming up <ea/>ati you know that chick was she dressed provocatively but there are obvious things for example this story of uh that chick was raped because she dressed provocatively but it's all in the mind If I have dressed I mean I wouldn't wear something that is not decent you know So long as I'm dressed <ea/>i I <ea/>jua I'm decent yeah even if it's minis People wear minis please yeah 
<$C> What about if it is not decent
<$?> But it's you <O/> you
<$?> Are you an animal that if you see a lady's legs you just feel 
<$?> No IIIe IIIe exactly that is what the teacher said It is the animal instinct that takes over because really you are provoked as in you've seen and it's like okay those are nice legs <onom/>ooh she is 
<$?> Just appreciate
<$?> Appreciate and move on You can admire and that's it Why do you go out of your way to grab her and rape her and then you say she provoked me and someone came up with this idea that this chick who was raped in Mombasa she was a Muslim in a bikini and you know the way bikinis are What would you say about that Was she provocative really no What was wrong
<$C> What RRRWhat about What about women who rape men
<$?> Okay there was all that they said 
<$C> No you have You never BBBYou neverRRR seen this movie BBBthis movieRRR called The Disclosure It shows how women when they are given power what they can do This lady was atop somebody She was an executive manager somewhere and then the guy
<$?> She had a guy a small guy 
<$C> uh and the guy 
<$?> But that is not really rape 
<$C> It's just power If they are given power they also be raping men 
<$?> But let me tell you the woman by the way she'll be in that top position with the other workers you know what she will do she will make advances at you She will make you know She will not just come and tell you come in dress you and say or rape you know this way rape *rape> *rape> 
<$?> We women we have that shame We are not like guys have no shame and guys you see like I don't know 
<$C> It also depends on the character of somebody 
<$?> Can I tell you what the guy the woman by the way she'll be The women if given power they won't just come and rape you 
<$C> Yeah I It's RRRIt's RRRIt's RRRIt's because of culture But if it changes such that women are given now <O/> power I tell they will be on the street here they will be picking men like 
<$?> No But you see 
<$C> It's only that they're not as strong <O/>
<$?> No but you see What is wrong with picking Listen There is nothing wrong with picking men What we are saying is big deal but the rape of a woman and the rape of a man are all different things You know why by the time this man is raped he morally has more or less succumbed You get because you see 
<$?> And a lady cannot rape a man by the way A lady cannot rape a man 
<$?> Yeah like in America It's like girls of our age have guns yeah 
<$?> People anywhere have guns
<$?> In case you just try to do something she'll just shoot you She doesn't care
<$?> <name/> said that what about a case where if people have guns then a woman can hold a man and unleash RRRunleash RRRunleash at gunpoint But honestly okay even the teacher said
<$?> How
<$?> At gunpoint okay I'm holding a gun to a man's head all right and I'm telling him to undress now it's definite that everything will shrink to use his words Let's face it one hand is holding a gun okay How will they do it
<$A> I IIItho RRRI thought you were going to ask so that he can demonstrate 
<$?> I mean no I'm saying no I mean You've undressed So how are you am I going to rape you No you explain
<$C> No you see now You see what happens now okay here is the gun okay somebody undress
<$?> Yeah undress
<$C> Yeah undress Now he throws away the gun and says he 
<$?> It's whatever it's a strong guy yeah 
S1A003K
<$?> Yeah it will just be okay But a man BBBa manRRR BBBa manRRR a big man who knows what's going to happen to him at gunpoint You see that time you are in two different  situation><+_situations> Somebody is forcing you to do something that you can't in that case you will switch off But a kid There is no BBBThere is noRRR way
<$C> The same way The same thing
<$?> There's no threat BBBThere's no threatRRR No threat at all
<$C> There are threats no There are threats BBBThere are threatsRRR Some RRRsome RRRsome of these kids BBBSome of these kidsRRR are just carried by the maids <ea/>na <ea/>usiseme No it's true
<$?> In fact can I tell you something that normally happens one for a maid to do such a thing <O/> it's like your sister you know it's someone they have <AmE/>gotten used to that is another point you have to take into account you see it's not <ea/>ati a maid a neighbour there who comes and rapes a kid of this house all right
<$C> Sometimes it happens anyway
<$?> No but more often than not it doesn't happen It's the maid of the house You know by the time the maid is getting to do these things on the boy he may not even think it's wrong let me tell you okay because 
<$?> The kid is so excited 
<$C> <ea/>Yaani and RRRand RRRand you rape some boy and she doesn't feel it's wrong
<$?> The lady will feel it's wrong but the kid wouldn't know what's happening
<$?> I'm not saying it's wrong but the kid will know what is happening because you can't 
<$C> Now No I'm taking a case whereby you know it's not just very small a boy like that maybe somebody like maybe standard four
<$?> uh
<$?> Even that is still a kid
<$C> Yeah He's a still a kid He's still a kid but when somebody is in standard four like when I was in standard four that undressed like that so a boy like that one <O/> that one <ea/>ni <ea/>sawa now the maid gets in there
<$?> Take a case where it's the maid who bathes the boy
<$?> What if it's the maid who washes the boy
<$C> The boy has faked an age whereby just wash yourself that time the maid gets in in that case is true 
<$?> Uh Let me tell you those ones happen to kids who are spoiled because the maid knows uh <ea/>mazee this one I'm going to wash him
<$?> Yeah And before a maid actually in such she must really know there is a maid in our place not really our house but in the estate This girl there were two boys in the house She used to fondle the two <ea/>nyonyo you know fondle RRRfondle and then the kids they didn't know it was just normal 
<$?> It was just normal until then
<$?> Until one time the mother of those kids came in all right and then the woman comes in and 
<$?> About what age were they
<$?> They were small six years old about eight years old So when she came in she is the one who caught her in the act okay and of course she noticed let me tell you those kids now when they were being asked you know is when they kept now saying by the way they spilled everything oh she does this and this oh in fact she could tell them and then where on her <O/> you know at she is feeling sick 
<$?> It's good they don't know what they are doing
<$?> Yeah you see
<$?> And let me tell you they had apparently had done that on and on and on so you see like that kind of maid she could even rape those kids <ea/>ana <O/> do this Yeah it's rape but you see the kids were not bothered because they don't know 
<$C> Now me I had you know the issue of a maid when we talked about shrinking of a man when <O/>
<$?> But if he is an adolescent or aspiring adolescent he IIIth those mechanisms might just you know
<$?> go off
<$A> go off or go on
<$?> Oh At gunpoint <O/> you are there
<$?> they at gunpoint <ea/>lakini the treatment will be just like that of a kid 
<$C> They will go off at gunpoint
<$?> But surprisingly enough even at gunpoint I hear they can still let them up 
<$?> Who told you this 
<$?> Some men
<$?> Okay Uh Olivia just like you by the way <O/> it's like put yourself in that situation somebody 
<$?> Guys A rapist he will let it up because if his work is raping he might even have it up all the time really 
<$?> 
<$A> Who was Which topic was it you guys were discussing I mean
<$?> Sexual harassment in the public and private sector
<$?> But does it usually have to go so far to be sexual harassment Even that touching of you are just passing
<$?> No just insisting on a date insisting on a date making phone calls and telling people weird things you know That is sexual harassment It's not really the By the way the physical could be very minimal What they actually do to her you know could be minimal but just what you suggest looking at her suggestively you know looking winking those things flirting with people That is all sexual harassment
<$C> And it's so common
<$?> So the teacher decided we are being taught especially the men in our class
<$?> Yes they need to be told
<$?> So that they do not go out there and do this 
<$?> and do the same
<$C> Now they should tell both of them 
<$?> But let me tell you 
<$C> I think those mini-skirts is harassment also so it should 
<$?> But <O/> let me ask you Let me ask you where is <O/> it coming now in the city <ea/>ama
<$?> If you do not have self-control over yourself then it's your problem
<$C> No RRRno you The thing is you are harassed
<$?> Let me ask you Why RRRWhy is it coming now In the sixties our mothers used to wear these skirts wait RRRwait
<$C> They used to harass the men then 
<$?> Wait No How come they were IIIno IIIno not raped then 
<$?> By the way morals as now 
<$C> No there were sexual harassment because you are saying this whatever is sexual harassment
<$?> No look at our tradition People used to wear next to nothing even in South Africa they still wear that just small skirts and nothing
<$C> So now okay now What is sexual harassment then
<$?> You guys you have no self-control you see
<$?> Yeah
<$C> No self-control We have
<$?> But I told you I put on that mini by the way they even go to an extent of tearing it you know that means you can't control yourself because what you are seeing is not you want to see something more than that
<$?> If your eyes Yeah Yeah 
<$C> No Okay now Uh you see now RRRnow You are BBBYou areRRR telling me about rape Us guys were talking about sexual harassment By the way what have you said what is sexual harassment 
<$?> It's It is It involves from touching commenting doing the real act without consent from the victim you know
<$?> making passes at the victim without you know you are unwelcome but
<$C> Now the RRRthe RRRthe psychological feeling of it 
<$?> That does not come in my dear Forget about psychological problems
<$C> It is 
<$?> It isn't 
<$C> It is <ea/>kama a phone call is psychological it is just something that you
<$?> It is not psychological because you we talk Let me tell you
<$?> It's physical
<$C> It's one <O/>
<$?> No It is by the way you could call me and say Hi my dear How are you That's it you could call me and tell me please can I have a date with you that is harassing me if saying hello to me how can you be IIIpsycholo no RRRno RRRno That is not psychological
<$C> Okay So what is psychological
<$?> But you know Can I tell you something The psychological aspect of it you know the you in you as in you deal with it okay Now if you see a mini-skirt and straight away you think RRRmhm straight away your mind your evil mind the animal instinct in you is taking control because you would like by the way you see more and to see what is beneath that skirt
<$C> By the way No RRRNo RRRNo RRRNo RRRNo RRRNo RRRNo Now I disagree with you I disagree with you uh
<$?> You see a lady in mini-skirt It's like you already classify that lady as an object That's an object and what's in the object is what you want
<$C> No RRRNo RRRNo RRRNo RRRNo RRRNo RRRNo It's what you see 
<$?> That is what you get 
<$C> Yeah uh No
<$?> Not what you want to see
<$C> Now you've seen You've seen somebody uh somebody in a mini-skirt 
<$?> What you see is what you get 
<$C> So you guys are not giving me time uh You've RRRYou RRRYou RRRYou've seen a lady in a mini-skirt okay And you know of course we are mature personally you know already <O/> that one now you are harassing me because now I know what those ones are meant for you know
<$?> What are they meant for
<$?> Meant for what
<$C> You see It's the husband who is supposed to see these thighs you know not just anybody else You know these my thighs my <slang/>boobs are for the husband to see <ea/>sasa If somebody else sees them then that is harassment
<$?> Sammy Let me ask you a question Where guys and babes swim together is harassment there You tell me
<$C> No 
<$?> Cause you see now everything by the way You see almost everything Why 
<$C> It's the BBBIt's theRRR occasion
<$?> Everything is an occasion
<$?> No Someone can't wear a mini like that at daytime
<$?> Can you tell me what is wrong with wearing a decent mini-skirt whatever to work official you look in fact they look <O/> very tough
<$?> No I RRRI know the minis that you have in mind I know the minis that you have in mind It's not the one I'm talking about 
<$?> I'm not having a mental mini here or here with thigh sticking out
<$?> You look very decent
<$C> Yeah Then Me That's harassment 
<$?> The one in a <O/> <O/>
<$C> Now that one becomes a different case all the same They are different circumstances
<$?> Okay leave alone that Okay RRRokay just RRRjust
<$C> Those are very different circumstances
<$?> Okay If you insist Let me just correct IIIcor RRRcorrect you If you insist <O/> people wear minis okay in the instances where an old grandmother woman who is eighty years old is raped by some psycho even her she was wearing mini Even her she was very provocative according to Sammy because that is what you are saying
<$C> Because of what she is wearing
<$?> And let me tell you does she look nice
<$C> Even a kid who doesn't <O/> is raped
<$?> You want to tell me that man saw those withered thighs she wore you see a granny is wearing something <O/> the withered thighs just provoked him to go and rape her
<$C> That's why okay That's why I said it depends on the occasion and the situation that someone is in
<$?> IIILe Let's put it this way Sammy let me ask you Tell me 
<$?> That shows if you get so excited because of just seeing thighs that shows you have just adjusted your mind to the rape 'cause by the way you see those thighs are normal
<$C> You know it becomes BBBIt becomesRRR normal yeah 
<$?> You see in abroad how comes babe and you see
<$C> It is with time It is with time No RRRno There is nothing like that
<$?> No RRRNo RRRNo RRRNo RRRNo RRRNo Let me tell you that is nothing 
<$C> That is nothing because they have been used to it They have been used to it
<$?> You get 'cause RRR'cause
<$?> You have better get used to it 
<$C> No Yeah To get used to it now you have to change adjust to change 
<$?> How do we change you by wearing long skirts How do we change you by not wearing <O/> 
<$?> RRRBy RRRBy RRRBy RRRBy the time it changes because we will have raped enough people
<$?> But let me ask you Okay RRROkay RRROkay That shows you guys are weak because 
<$C> Us guys are not used

<$C> Is it 
<$B> Why was Jackie insisting so much that I should come and pick you 
<$A> I thought he was supposed to be in that party 
<$B> Yes but it was abnormal I mean it was unlike Jackie to do such a thing to insist so much <ea/>yaani <ea/>mpaka started 
<$A> No but you see last time you disappointed us and so Jackie did not want this other uh function to go without our presence being felt She was simply being a good lady 
<$B> RRRAih Me I don't know <ea/>lakini I was suspicious 
<$C> Is it

<$C> A nickname 
<$B> But there are people who I know are called Peggy
<$C> Yeah that's why I'm wondering Okay like we're calling my boy Bobo and it's like everybody knows him by that name in fact nobody knows his real name and it just came up when he was a kid and he was doing <ea/>bobo you know the way kids behave RRReh So could hers have originated from a similar source 
<$B> No maybe she was just a sweet little girl and the dad decided it's Peggy
<$A> Uh
<$B> RRRmhm
<$C> So Let's go back to Friday I hope 
<$B> No RRRno RRRno RRRno We are not talking about Friday

<$E> Grins 
<$C> Not greets
<$E> Initially listen Initially he used to talk he used to say hello to me I thought he was very <ea/>kawa until You're looking nice you are looking nice the day of the party 
<$B> That day BBBthat dayRRR The day you were BBByou wereRRR taking some snaps 
<$E> Of the snaps in fact he RRRhe insisted I took snaps with him He is the one who insisted I take the pictures so I thought uh <ea/>kwani till later Jackie told me you know that man Mwangi is <ea/>sparko I said <ea/>uuwi and the way I was making noise at him uh he would have <ea/>harakishad me
<$B> By the way You I RRRI don't know but now he <O/> still talking to us
<$E> Then since then there even me since then I stopped talking to him but let me tell you he always has that IIIexpenct expectant grin on his face
<$B> You know that's how he is
<$A> Does it mean that you don't like talking to people who are sick mentally
<$E> No I was scared Why because he I had really I really made noise at him and so when the next time I saw him I didn't know but of course now I knew he is unwell okay I didn't know how to approach I just you know So since I had never known I decided the best thing is not to say hello and even him on that note he just looks at me <O/> he looks at me though a *grinnish> look you know uh Even he grins all the time Even the other some guy told me is that guy grinning at you or something I told him uh that is Mwangi I mean please it's okay I just didn't know how to react
<$B> But I guess now he's quite normal It's only that he keeps on Maybe it's because of the tabs he took He's quite normal
<$A> Have you listened to his story uh what RRRwhat happened between him and a Maurice He was uh Maurice's cube-mate Nasser has not told you that Wow RRRwow it was a scene and a half
<$E> When he went to tell him to shut up
<$A> You What happened they were staying in the same room Was it in G Then at that time he had just begun having those problems so Amori RRRAmori RRRAmori was to come back home some evening from <O/> and it's like the whole house was full of water you know It's like Mwangi has been trying to mop but he changed his mind in the process 
<$C> Okay
<$A> So 
<$C> He wanted to mop and IIIth then he stopped 
<$A> Yeah he stopped uh all the same but you know like in NYS we used to say <ea/>maji <O/>
<$B> No stop that <ea/>tabia 
<$E> No I You know why I 
<$B> Please do stop It's even necessary
<$A> So Amori just told that was not good so he needs to stop he didn't stop at that Another time he would come and he would make noise and he used to come late I mean until a <O/> got worked up and told him to check his steps otherwise things were not going to be in his favour Now wait until that day he said today everything here is dirty and so there needs to be thorough cleaning So there was water all over the place on <name/>'s bed and you in G had problems all those beds So Amori was worked up Amori beat the boy and it was serious
<$C> Amori beat the boy even though he was unwell
<$A> That time Amori had not realised you know he was just a normal boy then his head went nuts Amori just beat him up and people came Then things just went bad and Mwangi had to leave but I don't think he picked uh litter as such
<$B> Me I find him so well in fact I'm so happy that he doesn't talk to us

<$A> No for RRRfor this one This lady had a bad BBBa badRRR whatever when we were together Besides her RRRher sister was my classmate
<$B> Francis let me ask you Anything you RRRyou see around these parts of Moi University or you hear or IIIy you are told you have to tell Jwan and it's bad
<$C> No that's not true 
<$E> By the way they are all of them are like that We told Alex a very confidential story Alex <ea/>tu to the boys
<$A> I got that story from you Olivia
<$E> Okay the boys BBBthe boysRRR
<$A> So it's wrong It's inaccurate to say that Alex told it to us be specific 
<$E> By the way you know If you really value that story as in if you <ea/>hee Me I was so worried like by the way but the subject in question like I said before and I always say like I couldn't care less whether he got to know or he didn't It's okay In fact maybe it would do him a bit of good That is good
<$A> This is your granny
<$B> No That is a sister of my mum
<$C> Why do you say that uh Why did you say that Judy that's RRRthat's bad
<$B> Francis always tells you
<$E> Let me loyalties It's just <O/> the way uh please It's RRRit's uh I if someone uh RRRsomeone uh uh it would be IIIw weird to tell Claire something and then tell her but don't tell Olivia anyway
<$B> But maybe sometimes somebody 
<$E> Certain most of the things I don't think they are things I wouldn't know even if she doesn't tell me No Okay that what I'm saying very minimal but these other story RRRstory <O/> RRRstory <O/> RRRstory that way okay
<$B> But imagine if somebody tells me I'm telling you something and please don't tell anybody 
<$E> Okay That is confidentiality which okay But what I'm saying is there are those moments of course there are those things you discuss the two of you and those are stories between the two of you But now when it comes to story like I saw so and so I met who in this and that you know such 
<$A> No there are some of these things are highly confidential
<$E> Bu Yeah But some of these that's what I'm saying like now this one they are not that confidential
<$B> But you see Francis unless I tell you this is a secret and don't tell anybody even Jwan You will always think that it's not very serious so you will go and tell anybody even Jwan
<$A> No but you see
<$C> Do have any 
<$A> You see what happens here is that there can be a time where a topic can arise and maybe you want to compare like and like But I'm just not going to come from the blues and oh Olivia was saying this and this We can't gossip like that That is tantamount to gossiping
<$E> No it's just that You know That day Yeah You know why we said that In fact we remember after discussing that story so we said We told Alex uh <ea/>haki I hope you are not going to tell your buddies because and we let me tell you what happened 'cause even them I'm sure they will say these girls Then anyway in the end we said anyway big deal because really that is not the case that's not how it happened And you know Alex told us <ea/>ati uh how could I do that surely uh you know until I  lank><+_linked> up with Jwan and he was asking me you know he was and then he was asking me it's not bad but I just thought our mouths
<$C> Oh it depends on what you discuss I know the story already
<$E> Okay But that one was uh By the way that one In any case it's a story I had wanted we had just forgotten so that time we saw him like this we just remembered by the way you know even if it was not Alex we would have told any other person because that story we had decided surely we have to tell these boys You know RRRmhm one at least we were burning with it but then we forgot uh
<$A> This was good
<$C> This was the day of the <ea/>harambee

<$A> I was it was a little bit too much for me as you know Would I BBBWould IRRR BBBWould IRRR Okay to some extent she was right in that uh BBBin thatRRR uh you have to find out where you know uh where somebody is taking you but on my side I mean it was hurting <ea/>bwana I mean if you just don't trust me 'cause she RRRshe actually was waiting for <name/> <O/>
<$D> Yeah
<$A> Now she was like uh Why RRRwhy don't we go down together until the willow has disappeared Now she had gone So she was like see you give me a push I RRRI RRRI RRRI have no problem So in the process of giving her a push on the way didn't trust me I was so disappointed Anyway that's life Those things do happen
<$D> In fact I was BBBI wasRRR about to tell you that today I closed a file <O/> uh uh Oscar told me to postpone this story till now uh There are other crises
<$?> <O/>
<$D> I have not told you while I was waiting for you 
<$B> Which story is that
<$D> <O/> I RRRI can say I have made two major decisions in my life for the past three RRRthree RRRthree days These three days that have *past> I made two major decisions Booting friends You have the wish to keep them but your RRRyour mind stroke brain wants to boot them because they are kind of infringing 
<$B> Your principles
<$D> Yes exactly
<$A> IIIWhe IIIWhe When they do uh uh you will just have to but you take a choice you know
<$D> What can you do for example let me BBBlet meRRR give you a very practical example It's like this You give somebody your notes personal notes Then you tell her please bring these notes tomorrow morning She brings them in the evening Then what happens is this once she brings them in the evening you ask her what happened She tells you that I had not finished with your notes Is that a IIIjus BBBis that aRRR very good reason for not returning your notes Then what happens is this when I go for a Kiswahili lecture and then I bounce a RRRa philosophy lecture I come and tell her Can you IIICa BBBCan youRRR give me your notes so that I can go and copy in fact it was the lecture about the end of a human act Then she says No Reason She gives no reason Then today I told her very early in the morning that that time you were telling me that you RRRyou will have that There was some reading going on here 
<$B> Okay I RRRI know the RRRthe RRRthe RRRthe situation I decided to keep away
<$A> You RRRYou read between the lines yeah
<$B> Yeah
<$A> <O/>
<$D> He had to do because I RRRI called her and then I told her that I want to talk to you but Yeah IIIlet let's talk Uh Therefore I told her like this 
<$B> And then you received her 
<$D> Very simply it's like this You requested my notes I got angry when I got your message that you had written that I promised you that I'll give you my notes That was not true because I did not promise you I just said probably I'll bring my notes tomorrow meaning on Friday evening Then I said Okay that's it We RRRWe went and then I also added that uh RRRthat is what I said therefore your promise according to the philosophy of language a promise it means a lot it means a lot There is a difference between promise and probability Therefore I said okay that's what I said Therefore you are wrong on that in RRRin writing that message in fact Therefore I said 
<$B> You RRRyou didn't promise her 
<$D> I didn't promise Therefore I still I RRRI asked her do you still want the notes Yes But I RRRI RRRI love to make you remember two incidents that happened in second year And you'll tell me whether or not I'm just finally giving you my notes
<$B> Okay
<$D> Then I started Okay one time I gave you my Mazrui notes in fact I had mentioned that thing in class on Thursday And I said okay I'll give you my notes What happened <O/> how RRRhow long did I stay with your notes I told her that uh you stayed with my notes for more than eight hours and each and every minute means a lot to me What was the end of the first incident Then the second one I told her about those uh notes she refused to give Said that I can't remember You know what I told her I'm very sorry I don't like this but I'm very sorry to have such a memorable mind I RRRI just I don't I just don't want you to remember things It's very unfortunate but I have a very vivid memory 
<$A> You mean clear memory 
<$D> Yeah A clear memory not a vivid one And then I said okay that's it 
<$B> That's the first uh one of the major decisions
<$D> Yeah And then she took off hungrily
<$A> And there RRRthere goes a friend but anyway you know what uh at the end of the day I was telling this guy Me I believe if you've done the right thing it's RRRit's okay because if that's the kind of a friend she is where IIIevery everything just rotates around and about her her interest then uh you are better off relegate her to an acquaintance 
<$B> Surely
<$D> Sure
<$A> And that's BBBand that'sRRR as much as it stands right now because if she comes back to <ea/>gus with you I mean I don't think you RRRyou would refuse her but still you'll you RRRyou'll RRRyou'll have established your limits you have established what kind of a person she is and uh that's the most important thing
<$B> And I think this a major I RRRI may presuppose that this a major tendency that uh most of our ladies here uh uh are fond of RRRof RRRof RRRof RRRof acquiring some sort of or RRRor using
<$C> You see they RRRthey RRRthey RRRthey are not out to assist you In most cases you find it that it's a one way kind of traffic kind of relationship uh She She's not 
<$A> But that's the society Everyone is just opportunistic you know
<$D> Why
<$C> Where RRRWhere can we place the blame now Because for one thing they have been fighting for equality and with this equality that they are fighting for me I believe that you first have to RRRto level the ground and make sure that everything is at par such that whatever she gets if she gets fifty I also get fifty And it should be what we've all worked for individually 
<$A> But you see there's RRRthere's this question yeah somebody was posing uh the Kenyan the RRRthe RRRthe Nairobian lady I mean we are working in the accounts department She earns as much as I do And she has the audacity to come and tell me Hi Oscar Hi How are you <ea/>nzuri Take me out You know I mean We IIIear uh We earn the same yeah Buy me lunch Let's go for Take me for a movie Please I mean it's not like I have any extra shillings above what she has yeah But they're always on the receiving end even when their salaries are the same you know they are getting the same <O/> and the same BBBthe sameRRR allowance or you know uh 
<$?> e t c 
<$A> I'm just a Kenyan anyway 
<$C> The problem is this they claim that One they have a lot of things which cannot be met by their salary Secondly they say that it's better they RRRthey utilise our money instead of us taking that money to a bar You see such kind of bizarre reasons 
<$A> But you see BBByou seeRRR yeah They always try to make it uh their RRRtheir us-conscience you know <ea/>ati conscience for us in RRRin saying that rather than you go to the bar and RRRand waste your money down there and you know you RRRyou stand a risk of let's say getting drunk being mugged and you know so instead of like even saying you bring your you put your money to something that's useful that's <slang/>gonna RRRgonna come back to you RRRyou spend it on them that's a better investment you know 
<$D> You know that therefore RRRtherefore you cannot say that this RRRthis gender equality thing I don't think <O/> it can work in anywhere in this world What we can have is gender equity There is no way she can come and claim that RRRthat to spend my IIImo your money on me that is a better investment it RRRit RRRit means implicitly that she's RRRshe's like just starting a business You invest too much in her 
<$B> And given the fact that some of them have been letting many guys uh down
<$D> Yeah
<$B> You might even invest the way they RRRthey take it to be And finally she RRRshe RRRshe gets married to someone else So you RRRyou end up losing 
<$A> By the way By the way that's RRRthat's RRRthat's normally how it is yeah I've come to realise they quite know You find <ea/>ati <ea/>ati I'm pushing with a certain lady We've gone out for a couple of years by the way This time me I am going out with her like let's say tonight we <O/> in RRRin a movie theatre Tomorrow I buy her lunch we walk in <O/> place and feeling many times there's another guy much older than me He's buddy busy reading a accounts or reading you know law he's RRRhe's RRRhe's finalising his profession <ea/>Ama he's busy now just entering into the profession <ea/>ama you know in his career He's setting <O/> And then once he get the he gets the economical you know the RRRthe financial standing Now you just come and <O/> her off from here and you know she goes and You can imagine how when you backtracked with this date <O/> And I was still shining with her and you know and someone was IIIre busy making you know colours <O/> for her and uh
<$C> I think we have a Somehow we have committed a fallacy We cannot generalise the talk because there is this thing called love Money can't IIIb RRRcan't buy me love 
<$A> Yeah but it's true but in RRRin RRRin the sense that she might not take the money because of 
<$C> love
S1A008K
<$C> Do you BBBdo youRRR imply BBBDo you implyRRR that relationships nowadays are structured on economic grounds 
<$B> No Not wholly We don't want to make generalisations We are taking
<$A> I didn't say that I said however much the <O/> relationships may not necessarily so much so be because of the economic bit of it it could be love but still the fact is the babe I'm pushing with today chances of me marrying her are not aIIIre not so high Okay probably for the age yes but you know those that teenage thing it's normally just popular you know You start Hey this is my babe Shortly you change to somebody else and then somebody else You know 
<$B> And me if RRRif such a thing would happen to me I don't abstain totally 
<$A> It's so natural why not It's just like you <O/> and then you came to <O/>
<$D> abstain from what Opela
<$B> From making friends <O/>
<$A> No RRRno I mean it's so healthy to it's there is no problem The only BBBThe onlRRRy fact is it's RRRit's a reality like RRRlike okay I've had a girlfriend Now the relationship is over I mean when RRRwhen RRRwhen we are the guys believe you me I'll tell you uh Us guys are getting married getting married you know We are into the real thing you know And things happen you realise Oh okay The marriage was postponed or rather put off 
<$?> Indefinitely 
<$B> Uh In this case what RRRwhat can you do You just indulge but you make sure that you don't indulge so much But the problem 
<$A> No you make You make friends you make uh You actually uh I personally I believe it's healthy I mean you learn so much So that when you have the RRRthe person you're really you know uh serious with you'll not be making some funny RRRfunny errors 
<$D> In fact that was what I 
<$C> I'm not a person who makes trials and errors You make a trial and it's the thing the real thing You are very serious about it And you play your part even if the part is not played by the other party Then it's not a mistake 
<$B> This is why I'm saying that there is a problem We RRRWe don't know where to draw the line between uh the RRRthe real the RRRthe BBBthe realRRR Okay if I may use the term courtship <O/> this discussion
<$D> Yeah
<$B> If we can't draw that line it RRRit is difficult to draw it and RRRand maybe to identify someone who is not wholly committed If it's the man he might be cheating the lady that oh you know whereby you are the one and RRRand you are mean a lot to me and RRRand such like sweet nothings if I may say so If it's the BBBIf it's theRRR lady she might also put all the BBBall theRRR all those kinds of words whenever they meet one another But finally one of them is going to disappoint the other yeah There's a problem you can you can't BBByou can'tRRR tell who is cheating and who is giving true love
<$D> Therefore you've identified the problem <O/>
<$B> You can't Okay this is what I'm trying to get from you I'm saying that it's hard for me to draw that line so what can you do 
<$D> Between a problem and a solution or between problems
<$B> Okay it is between uh uh Maybe you did not get me clearly or maybe I'm not the one who is getting you clearly I'm saying it's very difficult to draw a line between the one who is uh giving true love and one who is cheating the other
<$A> You are right Because me honestly speaking okay some relationships me I look at them like this uh I just wonder I mean uh is it for conveniences purposes or is it for the BBBfor theRRR fact that we are in this age so in this age people normally have girlfriends so even me I have one <O/> some just don't think serious you know Okay some look serious but you can just see that honestly is isn't it they are you know like uh skewed you know it's *bended> on one side and you know someone is I don't know
<$D> But on this line I think I can support ladies because most people who are serious about relationships <O/> courtships they are ladies <O/> Guys are never serious 
<$C> <O/> Can you BBBCan youRRR substantiate 
<$D> I have a lot of friends who tell me how they can probably uh This lady she's RRRshe's just there for a short short-term basis and then I RRRI know BBBI knowRRR the person I will marry Not this kind She's just here to I don't know The guy is biding his time Therefore but for ladies you approach a lady and ask her How do you think about your guy She'll tell you that RRRthat is the guy of my dreams probably imagining getting one of his sons or daughters They think very far But for guys I'm telling you they just see someone very close either just for marriage 
<$A> <O/>
<$D> I I'm saying most guys not all guys I'm making myself clear Most guys And most people who are serious I repeat once again are ladies about relationships Though if you find some who are not serious that is ladies then just regret why you fell in love in the first place Because they can torment you uh
<$A> 'Till all hell breaks loose 
<$D> Otherwise we'll have to wait and see Experience is 
<$B> the best teacher
<$D> Yes 
<$?> <O/> best lecturer 
<$D> the best lecturer
<$B> <O/> I think there's this thing we wanted to talk about What happens when a person dies 
<$A> <O/> uh see I saw BBBI sawRRR you in the BBBin theRRR student centre You came briefly and disappeared 
<$B> Yeah
<$A> What was not happening
<$B> What RRRWhat RRRWhat I expected was not happening 
<$A> What did you expect
<$B> I expected 
<$A> What did you get
<$B> Yeah surely and uh RRRand uh in this situation I thought that uh maybe it was supposed to be a meeting between those uh visitors from Makerere University 
<$A> they meant it to be a RRRa meeting uh and then
<$B> between Makerere students and uh RRRand <O/>officials or RRRor <O/> members
<$A> Okay
<$B> So and I went there and found out okay it was some kind of a RRRa just a general discussion okay involving uh students from all RRRall RRRall RRRall units uh I mean all courses and all associations within the university So I was not expecting that and RRRand therefore I paused for a for some time and tried to listen what they were discussing about and I could not catch up with it and I just left again
<$A> Uh we were BBBwe wereRRR discussing pan-Africanism IIIWha What do you think of pan-Africanism 
<$D> On pan-Africanism I can talk a lot courtesy of
<$A> Generally
<$D> Professor Ali Mazrui I know 
<$A> Shortly Briefly
<$D> Very briefly pan-Africanism should I say at initially it was a Negro movement but nowadays it's a movement of governments in Africa in the Caribbean 
<$A> Okay a movement of governments but IIIwha what are BBBwhat areRRR you going to boil down is that does pan-Africanism really exist truly speaking
<$D> You know it depends from which school of thought you are arguing from If you are a Eurocentric definitely you will say that this thing is a myth If you are Afrocentric you will say it's a reality Do you know why even these scholars we think that they RRRthey <O/> They have some kind of bias whereby if from a Eurocentric perspective you cannot argue that pan-Africanism is a reality Mazrui argues from an Afrocentric and says it is a reality and we have five types of pan-Africanism and goes out to RRRto delineate  this><+_these> kinds of pan-Africanisms whereby we have this IIIsub uh sub-Saharan pan-Africanism about the black country scene black Africa the so-called sub-Saharan Africa We have this other one which links us with these people who are uh Arabs 
<$B> The IIIno RRRthe northern
<$D> Yeah the northerners by arguing that though there is the Sahara desert in between 
<$?> <O/>
<$D> Yeah the this IIIbri this Sahara desert is more of a bridge than a death trap When you go to the IIICari Caribbean islands we find that there is this IIIwest western-hemispheric pan-Africanism whereby we have uh these people coming together having uh unions that can uh cater for their welfare because of being IIIensel enslaved together 
<$B> That is IIIwhi which region 
<$D> The western-hemispheric region Caribbean islands and that kind of things Then we have this kind of transatlantic pan-Africanism whereby the black Americans or the so-called African-Americans nowadays link up with  this><+_these> sub-Saharan and IIItransatlan IIItran trans-Saharan pan-Africanists and argue that uh we are all blacks We've been through hard times together These governments have been very rough to for us And then the whole thing is encompassed in the global pan-Africanism And that is what I think Oscar is asking about And therefore it RRRit all depends from where you are arguing
<$B> School of thought
<$D> Yeah 
<$A>But how is the consciousness Pan-Africanism viewed as  a> consciousness was a was more or less a psychic spiritual thing you know You are conscious of uh your values as RRRas RRRas RRRas blacks you know as uh RRRas you try to bring that unity amongst you a unifying factor which is a uh being from Africa being black and uh having finished you know marginalisation in terms of economic and uh political stress from RRRfrom the outside world yeah Just how much Just how much of that is in BBBis in theRRR BBBis in theRRR common man today 
<$D> One problem is that in Africa especially Africa IIIsou sub-Saharan Africa we have a problem with culture You know culture is a very simple word that people just pass by But if you sit down and analyse what culture is all about you come to realise that in sub-Saharan Africa we have a cultural crisis identity crisis whereby people disrespect their culture And this is unheard of BBBunheard ofRRR in any part of world People are very very uh serious about their culture But in Africa we have a problem People don't want to identify with their so-called traditional beliefs simply because they've been told IIIthe these beliefs are primitive uncivilised barbaric You name them Therefore without first of all sitting down and reconstructing what was destroyed by colonialism and its predecessor uh slavery and such kind of things or its successor neo-colonialism right now I don't think we are going anywhere This is a problem that faced African countries on the eve of independence Instead of these leaders sitting down and discussing how to reconstruct this culture that has been that had been at least destroyed by all those years of colonialism they embarked on trying to achieve economic dreams for example industrialisation without taking into consideration that these people have to be sensitised that they are black They have to be sensitised that they have a common cause with the other blacks in all those spheres Mazrui observes We just have to sit down and we say okay Minister of Finance do something about the budget Do something about this Therefore there is no way people can be conscious of pan-Africanism and yet we do not do something about our culture And that is why it doesn't have a a lot of adherents in Africa 
<$B> And just to add on what you are talking about maybe if I RRRI may go to RRRto the grass-root level that even to identify ourselves uh with our own nation-state has been a problem in some of the African states such that uh there is this factor that has been hindering this RRRthis consciousness at the larger level of I mean IIIpan-Akr pan-Africanism at RRRat that BBBat thatRRR level because one thing ethnicity is a major factor People do identify themselves in most cases with their ethnic groups and RRRand the ethnic origins rather than with their own nation as a whole first of all I mean nation-state And uh RRRand it's from this level IIIwhere whereby we uh RRRwe might come together and uh okay As a result of this *conscienceness> we might come together and uh RRRand uh be unified as blacks within Africa or blacks within the IIIeth ethnic continental level So ethnicity is a major hindrance 
<$D> Okay 
<$?> Okay we
<$D> What were they discussing there
<$A> Somebody presented a paper so-called a paper She talked about pan-Africanism Then
<$B> Was she from RRRfrom here
<$A> From Uganda Then uh the reactions from the floor where people criticised people added people refuted and uh basically that was it One thing is that at the end of my view was like I was really just wondering just how much pan-Africanists are we 
S1A009K
<$A> You know there are things like we wouldn't we would yeah BBBwe wouldn'tRRR uh you wouldn't take your grandpa to RRRto RRRto a grandfather uh grandparents' home That RRRThat concept hasn't quite dawned on African society And when they come visiting they'd still be treated with you know that kind of respect you know that that's the thing that's in uh that that's not physical culture as such But what remains like when you just look around Okay physical or uh uh the non-physical culture There's so much of it exists even like in this hall BBBthis hallRRR of ours If you just take each and every individual and you can quantify that okay he has this measure of culture our traditional culture in him still Just what you know What percentage of uh the population in let's say the students in this hall would RRRwould come up <O/> where they still hold our culture dearly and I mean from the onset you just look at it it looks like it's fast eroding It's eroding pretty fast 
<$B> Very fast in fact even the percentage is really insignificant You can't
<$A> Okay probably that that's RRRthat's uh regional uh But that as much as we are here we never see any of that But then when you do start travelling around you definitely see those huts IIIgra grass-thatched roofs you know and that's physical culture you see And then uh very many other things but you'd agree with me that in the first place yeah so much of it has been lost where like you RRRyou RRRyou RRRyou uh think about when uh some communities would go to the shrine to worship uh a certain traditional god You know when RRRwhen RRRwhen uh probably some RRRsome RRRsome cultures still hold it in that for them when someone dies there's just so much you know uh BBBthere's so muchRRR BBBthere's so muchRRR don't dos and dos that have to you know go about with the funeral but still at the end of the day they RRRthey RRRthey have changed yeah There's some dynamism in it It probably isn't what it used to be you know like for the Luo when they say they RRRthey really cherish funerals yeah but probably it's not what it used to be exactly you know taken back to three generations uh I think 
<$B> It it's quite different in a way
<$A> I think it uh funerals used to be something <O/> Well we can't blame anybody when there's a BBBthere's aRRR strong influence from another culture what RRRwhat would you expect Or what do you guys think
<$D> What I think about this whole affair of culture is that we're the problem In fact it's identified by Professor <name/> that when these people came they came with their own culture And the African culture was supplanted by this foreign culture And in order I think in order to try to re-establish what was in fact my IIIobje my prime objection is we miss immaterial culture erosion Not material culture as such Material culture has nothing to do with it What is immaterial is always more important because it reflects how you think how you respect people how you obey them such kind of things the RRRthe way you dress There is no problem with this European dress The problem is how we and when we wear these things because the 
<$?> <O/>
<$D> Yeah For example mini-skirts It was in the immaterial culture of the Africans most Africans that a lady should not display her thighs The European brought a long dress and a short one Now where is the problem If she wears the long dress she will have betrayed the material culture of wearing skins When she wears the short one she betrays both you see the material and immaterial culture This is where the problem lies 
<$A> Okay like now uh there's this BBBthere's thisRRR thing about wife inheritance In light of what you know would you BBBwould youRRR like uphold such a culture
<$C> There is no problem with wife inheritance
<$D> In fact I was at Mary's place 
<$B> Okay
<$D> and I had to run away from that discussion because it was Mary and another guy called <name/> They introduced that wife inheritance And I was quiet for around seven minutes listening to them
<$B> That's a very long time
<$D> because there was one day this the Philosophical Students' Association held this debate about <O/> and <name/> presented a paper yes And then we discussed that paper for around two hours and <name/> said this so-called wife inheritance is a connotation from a Eurocentric point of view What we have is a companionship He used very good words 
<$B> to refer to that practice
<$A> I RRRI RRRI think that is clothing quinine in sugar
<$D> We have uh Yeah 
<$A> <O/>
<$D> Therefore he said it's RRRit's wife guardianship family guardianship a lot of terms 
<$A> I think BBBI thinkRRR okay did he specify what RRRwhat the so-called quote unquote wife inheritance implies
<$D> The whole affair Briefly he said it like this A wife who is a widow uh may decide whether or not even according to the Luo traditional customs whether or not she will be inherited quote unquote And if she decides she will be inherited she decides among the brothers of the clan she is in You know he was arguing for 
<$?> <O/> 
<$B> I think no I think what RRRwhat it should be or what it used to be is this that it was RRRit RRRwas like this When RRRWhen the husband died the widow had no choice other than being inherited because for one thing she was regarded yeah she was regarded as the property I mean as RRRas the member a member of that family you see In fact he was married to 
<$A> <O/>even when BBBeven whenRRR he is alive The minute you get married in the African culture or rather in the BBBin theRRR Euro-culture we became part and parcel of the family where the man comes from
<$D> That is true That is what Mr <name/> said
<$B> Yeah he said so
<$A> To an IIIe BBBTo anRRR extent that when you die you cannot be buried by your dad You're buried by your in-laws Yes to the extent that when he dies someone has to Okay there RRRthere RRRthere are virtues that went with it This guy who inherited you was there to take over the roles of the brother providing for you you know uh taking care of you and his children And in any case fulfilling each and every role that goes with it
<$C> Yeah that is what I understand I can remember very well
<$A> But you see at the end of the day I <O/> He defended <O/> guardianship or what calling it wife inheritance is not a really Because after all uh what is inheritance When my dad dies I take over his empire yeah And it's a business empire for manufacturing textiles I take over and I'm the boss now I'm the man 
<$D> Yeah
<$A> And uh from henceforth the decisions that have <O/> are made for by me In other words I run the company So by me inheritance inherits the wife he assumes each and every role so to speak
<$C> Yes
<$A> And provide for the children and give advice Well you know after all your my wife <O/>
<$D> Yeah I remember that that discussion took two hours and when we were standing with Mr <name/> outside there in that corner then we discussed for another two hours The questions are these In fact Mary was asking <name/> <name/> is a Luo
<$?> Uh
<$D> A
<$A> Oh Mary Mary is a Luo uh
<$D> Yeah Does the present situation in the country call for such kind of customs to be continually you know practised by these uh You know the society has changed She was arguing the society has changed Therefore Does the present economic situation justify such a condition if at all the wife is in a position to sustain her family 
<$?> Uh
<$D> React to that 
<$A> What I would say is I mean you don't need we don't need the economic conditions as such to make us lose that one Supposing uh she was able to or supposing she was not able to Don't you think like the thought today's thought process who do you marry you marry I marry someone I love 
<$C> Yes that's true
<$A> You marry BBByou marrRRRy someone you love to the extent that your dad would tell you marry Jane You go and get your Anne wherever you fished her from Whatever is in her that made you like her whatever is in you that made her like you it's all up to the two of you it's mutual That's what matters You get married Now your younger brother here gets married to so and so Okay Yeah Now your younger brother's wife dies So would you inherit her even if it's not the economic factor With today's kind of reasoning and uh viewpoint towards <O/> First of all if uh RRRif you are for it then you'd be much so a IIIpro or RRRa potential polygamist to be able to think of having two wives yeah And then for me to think of taking my younger brother's uh wife to the full extent I mean we can help her that one is for sure I mean she's part of family Yeah if she really cannot economically we can chip in economically and help economically But not to the extent of bringing her to my house or you know integrating her into my blood family and You see 
<$D> Yeah I understand
<$A> It's also a matter of if RRRif RRRif you're marrying because I think before you you'd actually even know your RRRyour bride on the last day as in far taking it very much behind 
<$?> According to the African tradition 
<$A> You IIInev RRRyou never used to choose as such The ladies never did have a choice as such You are just being told uh you come from a RRRa family that is well known to be you know doctors There's another family there who are doctors as well or blacksmiths and blacksmiths and you know It will be done for you like I know he's got a very good son It's a reputable family and we'd like to have association with and you IIIha RRRyou have no choice You see at that time the individual wasn't really prepared
<$B> <O/> 
<$A> It was a social thing so that even if you BBBif youRRR You see first of all your wife was brought to you So if you are brought for another one then who cares <O/> you go out and choose And you say I just cannot have a relationship with Anne because she is x y z I can have with so and so because I like this thing about her I like this personality about her I love her You know Then when someone pours off another RRRanother lady to your side to RRRto call your wife you wouldn't accept it whether it's economical also or not you see You get my point 
<$D> Yeah we understand you 
<$C> You can Can you <O/> this yeah How about in a situation whereby somebody plans the death of this husband eyes the wife and conspires 
<$A> You see okay
<$D> Nowadays 
<$C> I don't care about nowadays

<$?> <O/> decided can I go back to my ranch 
<$C> <O/> were here in the morning uh <ea/>kawaa <ea/>tu <O/>
<$?> That guy is proud uh Imagine Uh The way he refused that appointment and decided to go back to the roots to his farm And in fact he was the one who was on top of the tractor ploughing <O/> he was even ploughing for his neighbours after he finishes <O/>
<$?> Ambush
<$?> He decided I have better become a farmer than to become <ea/>sijui the under-secretary of <O/> 
<$?> Yeah <O/> the guy who was his 
<$?> Oh I see I see the logic Because the chief secretary is ahead of all permanent secretaries is on the top of all ambassadors

<$?> 
<$?> 
<$C> This guy is just picking up a <ea/>nini East African Community <O/>
<$?> He was still going to be under the chief secretary And while <O/>
<$?> Uh 
<$?> The Chief Secretary is responsible for all civil servants all of them under him all irrespective of where you are All of them are under his IIIdir ultimate So shortly he will be made an ambassador from a chief secretary <O/>

<$?> 
<$?> 
<$?> Okay 
<$?> No he was a permanent secretary <O/> director of Public Service Commission

<$A> no RRRno no
<$B> Are you afraid
<$A> No I'm not
<$B> uh
<$A> I'm not
<$B> just you and me and then I go right after that
<$A> just you and me 
<$B> so every time now RRRnow I'm in fear
<$A> uh you're in fear
<$B> now I'm in fear not anticipation fear
<$A> you know I have never in all my life 
<$B> RRRaha 
<$A> uh caused any lady to RRRto be afraid
<$B> Okay first time
<$A> perhaps only only no RRRno RRRno RRRno only afraid that I might disappear <$B> I think that's called vanity
<$A> but not no RRRno not vanity 
<$B> RRRaha the truth 
<$A> is it
<$B> it's the truth 
<$A> it's the truth is it just a matter of a RRRa proper and accurate appraisal of oneself
<$B> RRRaha 
<$A> now if you have 
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> the best thing you should do is just uh but the only thing you should do is simply acknowledge say the facilities Oh my god
<$B> That sounds that sounds like 
<$A> Yeah it was yeah
<$B> 
<$A> It's along the same line 
<$B> that was good that really was but you know I still believe that's <O/>
<$A> <O/>
<$B> all RRRall parts remain constant but in order to 
<$A> No but it's true I wasn't lying uh there was a service in progress
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> You know those divine service things
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> a service  begin><+_begins> with a hymn scripture reading that kind of stuff
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> and then somewhere along the line uh the RRRthe pastor they were supposed to preach the sermon 
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> Now at the end of the sermon they're supposed to follow 
<$B> What is that
<$A> It is liver pie no it is kind of light I can't quite tell Is that colour right the texture
<$B> I don't know I'm not sure why don't you just leave all that those bits that look like that 
<$A> All that look suspect
<$B> Yeah at least until the ladies come back 
<$A> They're many
<$B> That look like that no the rest doesn't look like that 
<$A> The rest looks fine enough 
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> So now on the platform up by the pulpit there is this guy whose RRRwhose RRRwhose role was to RRRto call the last song the closing song after the sermon Now when the preacher stood up to do his thing he preached and preached and 
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> I don't know but he was boring or uh the RRRthe guy who was supposed to call the last was uh was tired
<$B> tired
<$A> But uh whatever the case the damn guy slept
<$B> 
<$A> He dozed he just went totally Now the preacher preached RRRpreached then somewhere in uh RRRin the middle of his sermon he UUUpulled probably for effect 
<$B> 
<$A> Now that quiet the sudden quiet must have uh jolted the man awake
<$B> 
<$A> and so thinking that uh his time had come that was his cue he stood up 
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> proceeded to the microphone and said And now brothers and sisters we're going to close with uh hymn number such and such
<$B> 
<$A> Then he realized wait
<$B> IIIsi silence
<$A> something isn't right 
<$B> Was it silence or a collective sigh of relief from the crowd
<$A> No RRRno RRRno it was silence it was a stunned silence more than anything else What is he up to And he was like why isn't that the customary movement 
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> shuffling of books then the turning of pages and someone getting to their feet Then he looked around and to his horror he saw that the pastor 
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> was right there 
<$B> RRRaha at the pulpit
<$A> no RRRno RRRno toward the end you know the front toward one uh RRRone RRR <O/> one he was a very able man He was he would move around with many theatrics 
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> And RRRand he was there just gaping wondering what is going on 
<$B>
<$A> It was a true thing a true incident 
<$B> And then you all looked down and as you <O/> and then go back to sit
<$A> And you know you are Christians so you are like uh 
<$B> 
<$A> you can't laugh at the guy though in other settings you had laughed at the top of your voice
<$B> 
<$A> the man was so thoroughly embarrassed 
<$B> then RRRthen sat down
<$A> I met someone who spoke to me that you are a rich lady
<$B> I'm a rich lady
<$A> yeah and that uh 
<$B> I have IIIsom someone who is BBBwho isRRR <O/> that's what happens
<$A> It's all right 
<$B> Okay
<$A> Remember in this Nairobi we have to boil water before we drink it so uh that water was not for drinking whatever is in the 
<$B> Is not 
<$A> Don't come into contact then I know you don't like water especially cold water 
<$B> 
<$A> time like this is a cold night

<$B> Is poor and maybe we could ask her what's wrong with it <O/> What time did your ladies go off
<$A> I don't know I just came in a few minutes ago I had gone to Wait a minute this can't be right or is it 
<$B> It could be because

<$A> uh but uh it's called a life-time interest that you may 
<$B> 
<$A> you may give away every interest that is in yourself but there is <O/> right 
<$B> RRRaha self-preservation
<$A> not that BBBnot thatRRR 
<$B> really 
<$A> a right that shall always belong to me it's like land Land belongs ultimately to the government 
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> so that uh one dies and uh and uh you have to BBByou have toRRR do what and one RRRone does like IIIwho whose whose land is it ultimately
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> you find that government steps in like RRRlike if we all die I have land I die I have no relative nobody to claim after me 
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> the land will have to go back to government So similarly
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> I do have I stand in a similar position 
<$B> As RRRas regards me
<$A> as  regard><+_regards> yourself that when all else fails 
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> it's something they cannot really give away
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> somebody belongs to me 
<$B> too much played too much to life
<$A> RRRMhm this is just the 
<$B> but
<$A> simple way 
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> to state uh 
<$B> you're clean
<$A> like
<$B> is it state or stake
<$A> no RRRno I'm not staking it 
<$B> just stating 
<$A> yes stating it but I'm restating it but I believe we 
<$B> have a wonderful 
<$A> before we RRRwe both know uh where we stand
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> so that for the benefit of society altogether who might uh RRRmight not know
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> know the law has a will protecting the innocent partisan
<$B> RRRaha just beware
<$A> IIIye yes somebody will be protecting the innocent partisan a party who <O/> for value without notice
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> right so to avoid that without notice but we are giving notice
<$B> 
<$A> about everything we have to say
<$B> they are not 
<$A> they are not 
<$B> they refused to wake up in the morning for aerobics 
<$A> does that count
<$B> Now you ask 
<$A> I always believed that aerobics are for ladies
<$B> no it's also for men 
<$A> the exercises are too they're too what they're too can't get the term they're too late 
<$B> let's do this 
<$A> I need something heavy
<$B> let's do this 
<$A> after all
<$B> you're heavy 
<$A> <O/>
<$B> you're tough you're hard 
<$A> oh <foreign/>brudica
<$B> yeah enjoy yourself
<$A> is a girl
<$B> to UUUbrudicaring
<$A> Whatever you want to talk about or uh or <O/> it's always a girl 
<$B> and who voices all these complaints for the small roles in this country 
<$A> are they 
<$B> about girls how come this year they're not UUUstocky 
<$A> well they
<$B> because Beijing is over
<$A> yeah I think so that's one then 
<$B> that would be really negative
<$A> probably the girls have discovered that one men don't exploit women 
<$B> oh really what do they do 
<$A> women too 
<$B> to be exploited 
<$A> not even be really they choose to be depicted in a particular manner 
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> now if they <O/> depiction is to RRRto weaken the position of the woman 
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> she has herself entirely 
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> to blame I hadn't sympathized with those who play the dominant position 
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> and then when it doesn't turn out too well they start complaining nobody forces those women to stand back there are they forced to 
<$B> no they're not all but the complaint was not for those who stand back it wasn't for that women in front of a car
<$A> RRRmhm
<$B> but they're not complaining for her They're complaining for that woman who never stood in front of the car but who will later be seen as a possession because of 
<$A> But what I ask is this why did that woman choose I mean so who is really to blame the person who called out to stand there or the person who stood there
<$B> It is uh BBBit isRRR both of them society RRRsociety
<$A> Society between the women folk
<$B> yes
<$A> So I've never heard anyone addressing specifically women and saying look women we are willing accomplices IIIac RRRaccomplices in this uh RRRthis whole process
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> Nobody ever points a finger 
<$B> They do they just have attended too many seminars and workshops on that 
<$A> Well they say that when they just want to I don't know 
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> wanting to have what
<$B/$A> a habit 
<$B> But I read a funny 
<$A> The easiest way I might win this battle
<$B> RRRaha
<$A> is simply <O/> that no woman 
<$B> How

<$A> it's love founded in struggle that whereby he's writing the poem is I RRRI wanted to is somebody who is far away further removed from whereby he's addressing and uh as we're talking about what it have it has happened take the people in Africa during RRRduring the age of uh and struggle against uh colonialism most people who are <O/> uh their families their relationships in the camp of <O/> So these days writing from a faraway place BBBfaraway placeRRR we can't tell a place where but there is any location to show that uh he is further removed from where his addressee and that wherever his addressee will be IIIha they will be have a special relationship holding together
<$B> there is also an auditory to ask question about you know his idea to be a contract worker <O/> get me know for instance that uh the RRRthe contract workers who are really BBBwho are reallyRRR workers who are in they RRRthey RRRthey were all they were not uh BBBthey were notRRR educated and these people were supposed to RRRto work really Their labour was contracted you know by the South African government so is like uh <O/> of it all during that period and through that period and at least they were working they were supposed you know they were supposed to work very hard and apart from that you know they were supposed to the money was taken away by the South African government and the South African government in turn will suppose were supposed pay now pay the Portuguese government and the Portuguese government again in turn you know contract uh deduct whatever it considered as tax <O/> RRRmhm yeah <O/> drawing from the pay yeah from the pay of this
<$A> I tell what it means they give the family to the <O/>
<$B> yeah
<$A> this was a regular manner
<$B> okay so is like uh this contract worker was RRRwas isolated as he put it but we know really that uh the contract workers were really working in South Africa so is like this RRRthis is a letter now I think as you rightly put it addressing to RRRto one of his lovers
<$A> RRRmhm <slang/>'coz I'm imagining BBBI'm imaginingRRR somebody's old factory they had to go home if at all they go home and he's addressing somebody who he's really loving one he loves but he's away from her
<$B> yeah so RRRso how can we identify the okay the RRRthe generally the pain of this particular point I wanted you I wanted to address you to RRRto this particular line on the a nameless pain which pursues me a nameless pain which RRRwhich is this pain he is talking about
<$A> of this pain which the <O/> want I feel a nameless pain which pursues me is it the pain of separation
<$B> yeah now that we have identified from what that what we have said we have already identified that uh that is isolation it is lack of education and the basic emotion here is love is it So perhaps we can say that uh that reference to a nameless pain has to do with uh that aloneness that this gentleman must be feeling wherever he is
<$A> due to their separation
<$B> I don't know that is maybe but you can make additions
<$A> I guess the pain he  feel><+_feels> hurt there is this person he loves very much but apparently is far for him and the RRRthe RRRthe use of the word pain it is not something that maybe he caused to happen it's not his fault that they are separated could be it is the system that was UUUwanted to  separation><+_separate> them that have to force people to get out of their homes go and work for long days or months without having to see their families so that pain of separation from especially somebody who loves
<$B> yeah let me just to make uh an addition it could also refer to the anguish that he feels within himself the anguish of uh what  have><+_has> happened the dream of life of him and his likes it becomes a constant stigma in terms that to feel that you just must be a contract worker that RRRthat is your destiny and that kind of feeling
<$A> and also that it has to relegating to that kind of life you know where how you <O/> that together you have to communicate this way you can never stay together anymore
<$B> and also this it is this destiny to hiding the nature of this contract not aiming at his memories not perhaps to something that is a bit BBBa bitRRR as he put it is a it is BBBit isRRR some anguish which is in the heart but apart from this that I think it is also something which is again uh so immense it is not just one there is other pains
<$C> yes I don't know
<$B> it it's a pain not as we know it in the ordinary sense this is a pain that is unique
<$A> is it why it is taken it is nameless this term nameless why has it been
<$B> yeah or <O/> express
<$C> there is something which I really <O/> if he says it pursues me which means it is constant in his life it is something that follows him night and day it is something that is in him will come really <O/> so it is uh I would say it is like uh a stigma and then again this is your point as you say you know he can't write and really the idea of this poem is that this guy wants to write a letter to whoever he loves but he can't write so what RRRwhat is your modification as in the context of this point Does he complain that he doesn't have education as a tool to help him communicate his emotions his feelings to the other person or does he look at it with uh with uh in a satirical manner as to say just that uh maybe perhaps he doesn't need it at all What is your view what is education is a very central issue during that particular time like in the camp of <O/>
<$B> you're really
<$C> there weren't some really complaints that he can't write and really wants to write Is it a complaint that he's putting across or is it just at it in a satirical manner Does it uh does he just want to bring up a humour Okay as in the RRRthe last few stanzas you have to agree on a very critical issue here when not is this a uh the best agents of RRRof you know conveying this particular love as the major role you know the major role BBBthe major roleRRR things in life like uh
<$B> the wind
<$C> the winds you know the cashew and the coffee trees even he talks about the  animal><+_animals> the hyenas and the buffalo so is like uh is like he's RRRhe's making uh some point about education here uh I wouldn't BBBI wouldn'tRRR really say that uh uh he does not really need this education
<$B> okay
<$C> I think he's part of this pain he's talking about is uh RRRis as a result of you know lack of his education that perhaps now that he has BBBhe hasRRR BBBhe hasRRR been uh rejected now that he has not he has been denied this particular education he is not too happy very much happy about it and perhaps is now resorting to another means you know of conveying the same message perhaps even winds will do it better than you know the RRRthe RRRthe written message
<$B> uh the nature of the finals of the final line I think it's very emphatic but I can't write to see that oh my hopelessness I can't write it I think it's very emphatic RRRemphatic as to suggest that uh but the way for this guy there is not to have education he feels some form of adoration from RRRfrom what perhaps he would like to be or something like that
<$C> now I also want to know really I wanted to bring attention to this particular line about the RRRthe addressee in this line the addressee also can't read the addressee can't read I know we know that the addressee is right RRRright back in the home country that is in uh RRRin RRRin Angola okay So what RRRwhat is your RRRyour view about you know the situation of RRRof the colonised
<$B> no now it RRRit RRRit they still would say that
<$C> I would say that uh in this a letter to from a contract worker so I think the trend was that uh these people were not supposed to get education because they were supposed to be contract workers if RRRif RRRif perhaps they got education they'll become more critical they will question the kind of thing within their RRRtheir lives They want to perhaps to have IIIsome uh something better than just being mere contract workers The so in turn you were missing that comes from this pains that uh the RRRthe destiny for RRRfor the uneducated in the context of Portuguese uh colonies was uh to become a contract worker you didn't have to bring anything else what else and this man looks at that kind of thing that kind of RRRof stereotyping and is what fills him the lot of anguish above on just the fact that he cannot communicate his message of love to RRRto his lover in a letter it's also that kind of he feels that uh uh this lack of education <O/> him lot and his like I mean the people the other contract workers of the other countries around him
<$B> and I wanted also to bring your attention to this okay to me it appears as if it is some paradox of some kind who is talking to the person in this case is lamenting that he cannot write yet at the end of the day he's written a poem What does it mean 
<$A> all he's saying really is his intention
<$C> well you see this is a reflection BBBis a reflectionRRR of society this poem that is a reflection of society you know you cannot you can't just write what you are not but what you can observe isn't it
<$B> yeah so he's whoever wrote this poem the <O/> was just uh a reflection on his society was this reflecting on that strains being in society the emotions that go through the minds of people how they feel about the systems
<$C> so RRRso in RRRin other words you are saying that uh the RRRthe person in this case is quite BBBis quiteRRR distanced from the RRRthe poet
<$B> yeah I would say because we know BBBwe knowRRR BBBwe knowRRR the poet BBBthe poetRRR is Antonio Jacinto
<$C> yeah
<$B> but now he's created he has created a person
<$A> yeah this person 
<$C> yeah I
<$B> so it is this I now who is not able to who is not able to write
<$A> yeah RRRyeah RRRyeah
<$B> he's just
<$C> so it is now recollecting on RRRon RRRon experiences in RRRin the society
<$B> yeah
<$C> it's just like uh RRRlike you would for example you look around and you see things happen in daily  surrounding><+_surroundings> some you really feel for them you feel is there something to suffering and you feel for him but at one time or another you identify his particular problem in the BBBin theRRR particular case you can't write a poem you're even just do it yourself you are sure one person would say <onom/>aye because you also feel that's RRRthat's the emotion that caused to <O/> that particular person
<$B> and it's also this other issue I wanted to bring your attention to okay especially the RRRthe second the last the second last stanza uh the sorrowful words of the letter <O/> you RRRyou RRRyou know that uh the words of this poem change from sorrowful
<$C> they really look sorrowful in the BBBin theRRR strictest sense of RRRof the word what RRRwhat 
<$A> let's RRRlet's me tell you just there is a point here the <O/> pitying <*_>or sharp soul from song to song lament to lament would lead to pure and hot the banUUU the sorrowful words are very talented to read to me I don't know what is the person of the 
<$B> okay as have you supported the RRRthe person is that acquaints some RRRsome anguish but then he wants to write a RRRa love poem uh a RRRa love letter to RRRto RRRto the addressee who is way back who is now very far back home uh and now he RRRhe in the first stanza he's talks about this nameless pain and RRRand now he is talking about you know the RRRthe intimate secrects and in a letter of memories of you okay then he goes on to RRRto discuss the RRRthe nature BBBthe natureRRR of this particular of the BBBof theRRR addressee her lips you know the hair the eyes you know the breast all this thing that caresses yet I was really wondering towards the end he is talking about the sorrowful words of the letter and you know that these words is he the RRRthe poet is writing or the person is writing are not even sorrowful 
S1A015K
<$A> It is okay
<$B> Yeah is okay
<$A> Which topic is that
<$B> Twenty-first academics You know all these things will just come as you talk
<$A> Yeah
<$B> Uh not all 
<$A> I think uh let's start with the philosophy of religion and especially uh this part whereby uh we are tracing the origin of religion 
<$B> Uh
<$A> in the society
<$B>Uh 
<$A> Have you attended any class in the uh
<$B> Yeah I have been at least I have been attending
<$A> But I think your classes have been colliding with uh the philosophy classes
<$B> Yeah and you know the uh philosophy lecturers don't want to co-operate Like you know the timetables changed while they are in need those were put for the private but you know is like they are not wishing anybody to do the private
<$A> Yeah most of them sure They want to see what they will get before the end of the week 
<$B> Yeah
<$A> And also do they clash with your <O/> your external courses also
<$B> No at least now because
<$A> You do external courses
<$B> Yeah
<$A> In town
<$B> Yeah in town
<$A> Which courses are they
<$B> <O/>
<$A> <O/>
<$B> for they shall grow in RRRin fact they just
<$A> Which section now are you in so far
<$B> Three
<$A> Section three IIIhey you must be fast After that uh you go to which stage
<$B> Four now section four Okay each part has two sections like part one has section one and section two part two section three and section four part three section four I mean section five and section six So each part has two sections Now I am in the third section 
<$A> Section three
<$B> Yeah
<$A> You are through with section one and section two
<$B> Yeah
<$A> You are now in section three
<$B> Yeah
<$A> So you at least qualified to be uh an accountant or something
<$B> Yeah
<$B> as an account assistant not an accountant An accountant is a bigger man
<$A> okay
<$B> Yeah
<$C> A chief accountant
<$B> Ah that one you must have finished section six
<$A> And that one I think is tough 
<$C> And where do this really applied PNC NCNC scheme
<$B> Okay SPNP
<$C> Uh
<$B> It used to be there a long time ago but it has uh replaced by KATC you know
<$C> uh 
<$B> Kenyan Accountants and Technicians
<$C> Uh
<$B> certificate
<$C> Uh
<$A> RRROoh
<$C> So which is the highest level which is uh or it can even be done up to a degree level
<$B> No what I am told you is that after you finish section six you can qualify for masters
<$C> For masters after finishing section six 
<$B> Yeah
<$C> This means this section six is equivalent to a degree a bachelors degree
<$B> Yes
<$A> a bachelors degree
<$B> It is equivalent to a bachelors degree
<$A> And so for somebody to obtain that one has to be very tough
<$B> Uh I don't think these things are because if you compare it with what we are doing here 
<$A> They are better off
<$B> Not better off They are easy
<$A> They are easy
<$C> RRRmhm
<$B> Because you know there you are taught you know compare being in a college and being in a university You know in a university you must read for yourself The lecturer is just advises you on how to work
<$A> <O/> reading and researching 
<$B> Yeah 
<$A> He will only give you twenty per cent of what you require
<$B> Yeah that means you have to research you know you go to the library but there
<$A> Uh
<$B> they really make sure that 
<$A> Uh
<$B> they teach you
<$A> In fact uh you have to get a lot of grasping
<$B> And you know all these colleges are competing among themselves

<$A> unlike the university you know in a university you are not competing with any other university why because they are autonomous
<$B> But you know all these colleges they are competing among themselves so that 
<$A> Uh
<$B> so that the best colleges
<$A> for quality
<$B> can attract so many students
<$A> They gear towards quality
<$B> Yeah they want to
<$A> They just want to produce uh quantity 
<$C> And maybe to attract more students
<$B> Yeah because they are 
<$C> commercial colleges
<$B> They are commercial colleges 
<$A> Which one are you in Which college
<$B> 
<$B> Yeah but is not very expensive especially
<$C> Uh
<$B> for even students you know people <O/> fear more when they hear school that is expensive but I don't think is expensive
<$C> Uh
<$B> because like in the evening class you pay like four thousand eight hundred for the whole semester
<$A> of three months
<$B> four months
<$A> four months
<$B> because two months' accommodation is left for 
<$A> RRRaha
<$B> you know there are times when you are course intensity that is what they call property development exercise
<$A> So boy you mean you stay around <O/>
<$B> Yeah I stay around 
<$A> Your parent is here
<$B> Yeah
<$A> So you mean that you are through with our academic programme in the university here and you still have a place to stay
<$B> Uh I just stick around
<$A> Uh You see such course will be hard for us because some of us have to live uh we just go to the city
<$B> But these colleges must be wherever you are.
<$A> But you see now we come from rural area some of us So you can't just find these colleges there and 
<$B> Check okay
<$C> Yeah
<$A> I would have BBBI would haveRRR registered for it because instead of picking economics 
<$B> Oh you are doing economics
<$A> No I'm no longer doing it I am doing political science and philosophy
<$B> But at times you are doing economics 
<$A> Can't you remember You have forgotten
<$B> No I used to think you're the one I use to meet in philosophy Although you are very familiar RRRba 
<$A> Yeah
<$B> So as I was saying I like university where you have to read on your own In such colleges they must make you pass <O/> who if they were to know where the exam will come from they will just teach you on how to pass it
<$A> RRRmhm
<$C> Uh
<$B> because they are just competing among themselves
<$C> This exam is set by the uh I mean is a national exam 
<$C> I think is a national exam
<$B> No is a national exam
<$A> Some thing then all the students must register for this course
<$B> Yeah
<$A> Okay so is something recognised
<$B> is recognised
<$C> It is very much recognised In fact they have specific dates for this exam 
<$A> So now boy can you comment on this issue how religion came into the society 
<$C> Okay I have not attended much of the classes but yeah give your general view about it your layman's understanding of it 
<$C> How religion came
<$A> Yeah you explain what Ottelo was trying to RRRto ask What is your conceptualisation of religion in the society Trace RRRtrace its origins How do you come that man need to come down and think about maybe having something RRRsomething supreme or something of that thing
<$C> Uh I think this religion must have come in when man discovered he had BBBhe hadRRR problems
<$A> RRRaha
<$C> and it was difficult to solve
<$A> RRRaha
<$C> You know first of all you have problem
<$A> RRRaha
<$C> And you don't know how to solve it Okay like from my own experience I only think of God when I have problem
<$A> RRRaha
<$B> It is good to be honest 
<$A> It is good to be honest
<$C> Yeah at times like I don't know there is a time I had a very pressing problem
<$A> Uh
<$C> And this time I promised God God if you assist me to solve this problem I will be saved 
<$A> Are you saved now
<$C> I am not 
<$A> So your problem was solved
<$C> The problem was solved
<$A> So you cheated God now
<$C> Yeah Yeah I cheated God 
<$B> If there is God
<$C> Yeah if there is God 
<$A> Of course God is there
<$C> Then I lied to him
<$A> That is the thing at least we commonly know that God is there we can't uh BBBwe can'tRRR achieve that 
<$B> Yeah
<$C> Uh
<$A> We know God exists How would you react to
<$C> The fact that we can't prove that god exists means he is not there
<$A> So we RRRwe try to prove and we can't uh BBBwe can'tRRR even convince this means BBBthis meansRRR is like we can't also if we don't have the material BBBthe materialRRR the linguistic material to explain or to express God's existence that means that God is not there God is still there I still believe that
<$B> You believe or you can prove
<$A> We can't prove because you see God is 
<$B> That kind of thing Believing I mean we need to believe you can't BBByou can'tRRR 
<$A> Uh
<$C> So that you can understand 
<$B> Have you borrowed it from <name/> 
<$A> I can't borrow it from <name/> but I read some of his works
<$B> Some time ago
<$A> Uh so but now boy I have still one question
<$C> Uh
<$A> Now that you told me that when you have problems
<$C> Uh
<$A> you tend to maybe remember God or such things are your problems really getting solved now as a result of you taking them before God or how does the solution of the problems come about
<$C> I think most of the problems have been solved 
<$A> By the power of gGd or by what power
<$C> All circumstances that came uh 
<$B> Yeah you RRRyou know all circumstance can come in but you tend to think that
<$C> Uh What happen there is another day in fact I don't know what really happen because you have you just see a coincidence and you RRRyou really don't know how it worked out Like assuming you are here
<$A> RRRaha
<$C> two minutes ago
<$A> RRRaha
<$C> then something tells you just walk from here go and stand there 
<$A> Uh
<$C> Then no sooner have you walked away from there than say a bomb erupts from here 
<$A> uh
<$C> Now how RRRhow will you BBBhow will youRRR explain that You know at least you 'll tend to think the power of God is working God is really with me
<$A> Uh
<$C> At least is God who told me to move away from here
<$A> Uh
<$C> because he knew something was going to happen
<$A> Okay now let me ask you some question there
<$C> Uh
<$A> So you want to tell me that those who have been perishing as a result of the explosion of this bomb
<$C> RRRaha
<$A> are not with God since you claimed you are with God and God has guided you to move from that point of disaster to a safer point so you want to tell me that those who perish there are not with God
<$C> And this is where I find religion to be uh
<$A> absurd
<$C> absurd and maybe to claim that it is God that guided you 
<$A> RRRaha
<$C> also to be absurd
<$A> RRRaha
<$C> because for one thing
<$A> Uh
<$C> God being the creator of all humankind
<$A> RRRaha
<$C> why should he decide to RRRto take away boy from a particular place where a bomb is RRRis 
<$C> almost exploding 
<$A> RRRaha
<$C> and leave the others to be BBBto beRRR knocked down by the bomb and perish uh
<$B> Yeah
<$C> This is the question I have been asking all these people who BBBall these people whoRRR claim that they are  saviour><+_saved> and they come to RRRto trying to RRRto save me also Or help me get saved I still don't understand Like there is a case Okay a certain relative of mine who died in a very BBBa veryRRR BBBa veryRRR 
<$A> RRRaha
<$C> what can I say I mean he suffered so much 
<$A> RRRaha
<$C> before finally getting finally dying
<$A> Okay there was much RRRmuch
<$C> Yeah much pain Now I am asking if at all God knew that this man
<$A> RRRaha
<$C> is finally going to die because at least we are all aware that God knows what is going to happen to someone and everybody if anything
<$B> Uh
<$C> Just like they say
<$B> Uh
<$C> Now even if we all know it
<$A> Yeah
<$C> Now how comes he can let one to suffer so much
<$B> Uh
<$C> before finally taking away his life Why can't he just take away his life early enough so that he does not suffer and maybe some kind of you see These are some of the problems that religion cannot answer
<$B> Uh
<$C> when we start questioning we ask more questions than they can answer So is part of the problem anyway is part of the problem
<$A> How do you constitution of it boy the whole idea 
<$C> Beautiful there is a claim that God has a plan for everybody
<$A> RRRaha
<$C> Like you know like there are at times Christians could come to me and how we need to get saved
<$A> RRRaha
<$C> So I use to ask them why is it that God is so I don't know which word to use <O/> he makes some people suffer while others enjoy
<$A> Uh
<$C> Yeah God is so discriminating
<$A> Uh
<$C> and they used to tell me that God has a plan for everybody 
<$A> He is a jealous god 
S1A016K
<$C> It appeared surprisingly the charge was reduced it from murder to manslaughter 
<$B> Uh
<$C> and then I don't know he's now only convicted for a few  month><+_months>
<$D> Which one is better Manslaughter is better I think
<$C> I think now he was convicted for around a year I'm not sure and you know 
<$C> He has already stayed in the prison for some time <O/> he was appealed for 
<$C> Yeah so you know the magistrate the judge was convinced that since he has already stayed in prison for some time
<$B> Uh
<$C> and he has now been convicted for a year
<$B> Uh
<$C> he should be released because at least he has already finished a year
<$B> Uh
<$C> So the girl was released 
<$A> He was acquitted
<$C> Yeah the girl self and you know what she gives them problems she gives them testimonies because she still gives them problems now
<$A> Uh
<$C> She just can't decide to get saved 
<$C> <O/> a white man who is a missionary in my place
<$A> Uh Would you allow me to release a <O/> from my own I will be coming just immediately
<$C> Yeah so I was talking about this missionary in my place that he was telling me that he comes from Canada I just want to visit him in his place but he lives in Nairobi
<$B> Uh
<$C> so he told me BBBhe told meRRR that you see in Canada people don't care about going to the church
<$B> Uh
<$C> because people they have basically everything for human existence that they need like a car almost everybody is having a car
<$B> RRRRRRaha
<$C> and there is just no much problems 
<$B> Uh
<$C> and some people will find no reason of going to church
<$B> Uh
<$C>So I told him so <O/> people are materialistic in your place
<$B> Uh
<$C> He said Yeah kind of kind of people are materialistic but you see
<$B> Uh
<$C> Yeah somebody can have that concept of God and you can know that God is there
<$B> Uh
<$C> but to bother to go to church or why go to church there is no need
<$B> Uh
<$C> <O/> unless
<$B> There are no problems
<$C> Yeah unless one is in full service that is the time he is going to take himself now to the church for
<$B> Uh
<$C> such purposes 
<$B> Uh
<$C> So I was trying to compare it with Africa so he said now in our case if you come to Africa so how do you find here
<$B> Uh
<$C> So he declined to comment
<$B> RRRaha
<$C> Sometimes I don't know due to personal reasons or what he declined to comment the
<$B> He is a foreigner isn't it 
<$C> Yeah he is a foreigner
<$B> Uh
<$C> But he was very good he was very social
<$B> It could be BBBit could beRRR he was declining because he does not know much about Africa
<$C> Yeah maybe because he was enquiring a lot of things from me
<$B> Uh
<$C> So
<$B> And for that matter what RRRwhat was he implying Was he implying that in Canada uh people are not 
<$B> people are not all that religious
<$C> Yeah
<$B> And then if they are it is just an insignificant of them
<$C> Yeah
<$B> Okay
<$C> Yeah they don't see it because people are comfortable
<$B> I see
<$C> So you bring a <O/> to them tell them that this is the new way
<$B> Uh
<$C> And they are already comfortable you see uh
<$B> They don't bother 
<$C> So the impact is just insignificant 
<$C> So to a very big extent or to a large extent
<$B> Uh
<$C> What <O/> was saying that uh
<$B> Uh
<$C> You see when you have problem is the time people rush to church I think is a 
<$C> is appointment to <O/>
<$B> Uh 
<$C> to hold water
<$B> Uh 
<$C> Uh
<$B> So you must be wondering why people must go to the church
<$C> Yes that is the question I have been asking myself for a very long time
<$B> RRRmhm
<$C> and I have even come to conclusion on subjective basis 
<$B> Uh
<$C> that I should not maybe consider myself as one of the people to go in the street because of any church I don't just love it
<$B> Uh
<$C> I have found that it is of no use 
<$B> Uh
<$C> In fact it is expensive
<$B> And is very expensive
<$C> and in fact <O/> are commercialising it and most of the people are not even 
<$C> Yes
<$B> This thing they call 
<$C> And with this money
<$B> RRRaha
<$C> and out of this money
<$B> RRRaha
<$C> the man can even buy some of the RRRthe his house properties
<$B> RRRaha
<$C> Uh and it is that money 
<$C> That is what she is going to <O/>
<$B> Surely
<$C> They don't misuse it
<$B> Uh
<$D> They are supposed to be not
<$B> No for the wedding 
<$B> <O/> collect some money to be used during the wedding
<$C>Yeah during the wedding
<$B> But you know these are <O/> because of the wedding 
<$C> Uh
<$B> then they find their houses and begin to
<$C> Yeah and even BBBand evenRRR 
<$C>And even develop a plot 
<$C>They can even develop a plot
<$B> I mean they have got this fund for their wedding or something else
<$C> Yeah
<$B> so is not fair to the people
<$D> Is not fair
<$C> And it is very bad by the time we are waiting for a class in the mph
<$B> Uh
<$C> and so there is a lady a certain lady who brought her another card for us I was sitting next to Kabuwe
<$B> Uh
<$C> so Kabuwe abuwe told us that if it is for wedding I am not going to contribute
<$B> Uh
<$D> Which class was that government class
<$C> We were waiting BBBwe were waitingRRR here we were in a BBBwe wereRRR in second year
<$D> Second year RRRaha
<$C> We were waiting for government class
<$B> RRRaha
<$C> The lady was so much embarrassed
<$D> Why
<$C> Usually because she was expecting that at least we contribute and then if uh we don't have money there and then
<$B> Uh
<$C> then we can write something and later on give him give her the money
<$B> Uh
<$C> But by the time we just put her off RRRey 
<$B> And it was pre-wedding card
<$C> Yeah pre-wedding card 
<$B> Things are commercialising these days
<$D> Uh
<$B> Too RRRtoo entrepreneur in nature
<$C> Yeah
<$D> So you decided not to 
<$C> Me I have come to a point whereby I don't think it is important to <O/> first the principle that the first principle that I have based on my rejection for wedding is that maybe people are taking it to be a kind of a show-off
<$B> Uh
<$C> Somebody wants to display how much
<$B> Uh
<$C> how much <O/> used in the wedding
<$B> Uh
<$C> And now you see it is like a competition such that
<$B> Uh
<$C> When you let's say for my case now if I don't have enough  fund><+_funds> to uh spend for the wedding
<$B> Uh
<$C> <O/> below that level 
<$D> And others RRRothers take it for prestigious purposes you see
<$C> Yeah others you see people have been 
<$D> That you RRRyou are all Christians and you've been going to church together and now somebody you can even hear somebody I mean 
<$C> Uh
<$D> carrying on some rumour that so and so <O/> this is the way he is that he cannot even hold a wedding he cannot and then they claim to be Christians you know is just to RRRto diminish others I mean relegate others
<$B> Uh
<$D> while you praise yourself you feel prestigious
<$B> It has become a matter of competition
<$D> Yeah and then 
<$D> They are distorting the meaning of the thing all together And this thing has discouraged many people from doing their weddings in churches because
<$B> Uh 
<$D> So in my case I don't know that is still a question I put to in suspense 
<$D> Anyway I have not decided which way to follow 
<$B> Uh
<$D> I can use the traditional way which is still fine 
<$B> Yeah
<$C> Or you RRRyou wed in 
<$D> Yeah these are all possibilities Maybe a time will come I will maybe get to I will <O/> it
<$B> Uh
<$D> Yeah about it
<$A> So let's go back to this issue of religion boy
<$B> Uh
<$A> You know I RRRey do you people believe in the existence of uh spirit <O/> spirit
<$B> <O/> spirit
<$A> Uh that when someone dies there are so many <O/> spirits there 
<$A> Even yellow spirit boy
<$B> <O/> spirit well I don't know 
<$C> <O/> being philosophical rather than being religious
<$A> Yeah the two must go together because you see philosophy asks why this
<$C> Uh and religion asks why this in philosophy
<$A> Yeah
<$C> in fact during medieval time the argument is that philosophy is a lot of religion
<$A> Yeah
<$C> And religious people argue that is now No I mean is the philosophy people are arguing that 
<$C> that religion comprises of philosophy 
<$A> That is the conflict between religion and philosophy
<$C> Yeah
<$A> Yeah
<$C> But I don't see anything wrong with it We can just discuss it for the sake of being I mean rationally and looking at things critically
<$A> Uh
<$C> without even basing our arguments on okay without even referring to those who are only religious people or those who are only philosophers
<$A> Yeah that is general now do you think this thing called soul does it exist Do we have Does human being have a soul
<$C> Now what do you mean by a soul
<$A> Is like in religion I have heard many people say that you see when you die your soul goes somewhere
<$C> Uh
<$A> or something for that <O/>
<$C> Uh
<$A> So I have tended to doubt there is one court house
<$C> Uh
<$A> So that thing they call that I don't know 
<$C> In fact in Plato Platonic sense
<$A> Plato that one will be different because I think they were pretty so
<$C> Uh
<$A> to <O/>
<$C> to psyche
<$A> Yeah I think so
<$C> RRRaha
<$A> In the mind
<$C> Yeah in the mind
<$A> That is why we think that you see when you
<$C> Uh
<$A> the soul goes to the world of the ideal world of RRRof forms
<$C> RRRaha
<$A> so that it goes back again into and  inhabit><+_inhabits> another body
<$C> RRRaha 
<$A> in the process of <O/> or so
<$C> Yeah
<$A> the Platonic kind of transfiguration or so
<$C> Uh
<$A> So that one I think you don't believe in I don't know but I think it was like <O/>
<$C> If we don't divorce philosophy do you think that can be equivalent of God you mean they mean the same thing
<$A> the ghost
<$C> I think a ghost has usually been RRRbeen taken in the sense that it means something that is Okay those spirits that are somehow evil
<$A> Uh
<$C> and they are not out for the main good of those who are still living now for a soul It is taken to be something that is RRRis something holy and when someone dies it will be going to either to hell or going somewhere where we don't know waiting for the judgement according to religion
<$A> So do you think a soul can be associated with something good or a ghost is
<$C> That is what I tend to think but I stand to be corrected I don't know
<$B> Yes of course
<$A> Me I don't think so because now if we associate a ghost to something negative that is what you imply
<$C> Yeah
<$B> Uh
<$A> Therefore it means that saying Holy Ghost if they say that God is Holy Ghost in Christianity
<$C> RRRaha
<$A> So what does then 
<$A> You see it is contradictory now 
<$A> Holy and ghost and then you say that ghost is something I mean is a spirit that is bad that causes evil on peoples
<$C> RRRaha
<$A> that brings things that are negative
<$C> Okay Yeah something of that nature how do you say about to such an extent I don't think I think I speak uh
<$B> Uh
<$C> So it can still be treated to a ghost
<$A> A ghost uh
<$B> Yeah then if at all a ghost then I think they exist because I have heard of stories where people say they saw so RRRso and so that died Have you heard of such a story
<$A> Yeah I have heard of such stories but I am still yet to understand how really it is You see you can't understand some of these things and you don't know how they come about 
<$B> Uh
<$A> How can somebody say that somebody died a long time ago and now she saw the ghost of the same RRRsame person also last night
<$B> Uh
<$A> You wonder what is really happening for that matter I think we can in fact
<$C> So we have a ghost that is what we conclude
<$A> A ghost and a spirit 
<$C> Uh
<$A> it is just the same thing These are synonymous terms
<$C> Yeah
<$A> so that we can have an evil spirit or an evil ghost and RRRand a good spirit you see
<$B> Or good ghost
<$A> Yeah maybe we could have such things 
S1A017K
<$A> What I'm saying is you said I should and I say I'm going to get married or I intend to later on but right now I think it just depends if the right person comes along Now this thing of being swept off your feet
<$B> Now let me suggest specify a certain point from here I get married at the twentieth of July after I leave campus
<$A> No but what's your right age to get married There is never a right day The right is I think is more the right time than the right age How do you know you're ready for a marriage <O/> uh the day my daughter was ready to marry if not you must be quite unfortunate 
<$C> it's true that's why I think marriage really it has to wait
<$B> Waiting with all the frog's faith your beauty create the prince
<$A> Why it has <O/> it has to be 
<$B> Well it happens to most of the people is that you know you can only take a case study of yourself
<$C> Now let's take a case whereby maybe your background at home you see marriages and you see directly what is happening in marriages You see them breaking up going towards divorce and all that Why should I look forward to marriage after I've seen all that
<$B> Well I believe here the situation is different
<$A> Yeah 
<$C> circumstance
<B> I also think that you can take the opponents of the work this institution work Look make a difference to be one it means 
<$C> To prove your points there are also some marriages which are very good still You know people live happily they UUUneed together understand each other I think the main thing here is just understanding
<$A> and get paid
<$B> my at least in I don't say <O/> when my brideprice enough
<$A> with any marriage
<$C> Yeah and I'm not going without that price being big
<$B> I think is this the prevailing situation You know things are changing for the better or for the worse or whatever so brideprice actually is uh what individualistic
<$A> culturally I think
<$B> so we should do our road
<$C> Well let's say your parents you might want to do it but your parents might not See after educating you all these years they may want to get something after the whole process 
<$?> But no right right now UUUdivisions are basic need
<$C> It is yes it's a basic need but the sacrifices your parents had you got it
<$B> More than this my husband is more educated than I am you have to be <O/> you know
<$C> He still BBBhe stillRRR has to pay for that kind of respective work when you are  took><+_taken>
<$A> I don't BBBI don'tRRR I just find <O/> it drags BBBit dragsRRR marriages and all like if I go without him being anything it's like have eloped and I wouldn't want to have that reputation that I eloped
<$B> I think uh Christianity authorists have off to claim peace My parents never paid that kind of brideprice in the fifties can you believe 
<$C> Yeah my mum would have paid for brideprice I think it was not the boys They are trying to set an example in a society where everyone else is doing this but still today when I meet my cousin <O/> my mum would have paid for your brideprice So if anything happens its opponents give in if that situation arises at you you have to pay 
<$A> But I okay thanks that setting communities whereby if like your mother has given that brideprice now when she dies there arises a problem your mother's people will come and claim that she is still their daughter <slang/>'coz they don't recognise your father
<$?> Yeah for us is a provision provided if yeah to get that lady instead where you have to pay an initial price of three goats Once you have three goats just three goats as it were RRRwere three goats in faith three goats nothing can separate you even if they go to the courts 
<$?> I see your father has to pay three goats
<$?> Three goats 
<$?> to your mother's people
<$A> I believe three goats yeah First when you're going to meet them you take beer and take four goats one the people eat and the other three are kept
<$B> Okay so that one has already cleared that
<$C> That's cleared that Now let's setting the stage for any other things that you would want to give your 
<$B> Is the first thing your father goes to your mother's home
<$A> No
<$B> Is it like an introduction Is it like to propose yourself a proposal like for the marriage or your mother is already gone
<$C> Okay first the two people might have met before the parents no long time it was used to be parents sometimes arranged from both sides But now in these days they meet by themselves and that's okay so Well much later they can do the tradition if they want to get married First we shall go through the custom the custom of really <O_><O/> your parents have the goat <O_><O/> there's a goat in your hand that you want to dig <O_><O/> So now it's up to your parents to say yes only to say yes when they have the goat they RRRthey go and bring the first goat and beer they did bring it it's called the beer step into the home
<$A> Yeah saying step in the home that beer both parents take First the lady takes the mother the bride's mother takes gifts to the bride's father After they take gifts their negotiations start if the <O/> go ahead means when they can go back and bring the goats At this stage the parents can still say no The parents now will have now they might have goat But the UUUops they obviously leave the RRRthe goats in their ropes 
<$B> RRRmhm that's we believe we're saying all the first time we never get married again
<$C> So that they have to just agree 
<$A> they have to agree
<$B> for every proposal what comes
<$C> for every proposal that comes I mean if a man is interested in you
<$B> okay
<$A> what is holding you back that's the way they used to live
<$C> it's like the girl has no choice
<$B> yeah that's right It's sort of like the girl has no say If the man is interested then she just has to go
<$A> she has to go yeah
<$B> whether she likes it or not
<$C> whether she like it or not
<$B> that's forced
<$C> yeah
<$A> to get married
<$?> they did initial three goats that are still alive They're supposed to be still alive They're not supposed to be killed It's only the RRRthe one that's slaughtered supposed to be three  goat><+_goats>
<$A> okay well at least it's shows promise you promise to take care of something
<$?> yeah
<$B> which will be accepted  But this really it's like
<$C> so even in the contemporary society another case right now examined interesting and we read out here obvious that will be the arranged marriages We read out here first he has to bring his four goats
<$A> okay nowadays you get these people where which would say come and stay whereby you move into your boyfriend's house and you stay You have your first kid second kid before he even meets your parents Now then one great day he just  meet><+_meets> someone else and he went dresses up from your house which you live in and then he goes to attend the wedding You only get to hear that your husband got married your boyfriend got married Now in this case he will leave you You don't have a basis on which to say that you are married but according to everyone of the neighbours you are married <slang/>'coz you used to live together
<$?> that comes still estate agencies yeah comes state nothing you need
<$B> now I'd rather say not go through that
<$C> at this stage they may think brideprice is not 
<$?> it's important
<$?> that's why I'm saying
<$?> it's a binding
<$?> it has to BBBit has toRRR be there There is no other way we can do We just walk up to be parents
<$A> no but on the other hand is the legal procedure that means you can either go to the DC and you declare you're married At least something to show Know that one day you'll just walk out and that is all
<$B> I don't know why I don't know why but have this feeling that this is the BBBthat this is theRRR register place It's not so bad but compared to the custom you can just wake up and say no forget it we are not into each other we're just bad But you see now before you get to separate and you've gone through the other custom of the brideprice the traditional manner then in a state of trying to reconciliate 
<$C> as in the it is a provision for that by the entrance
<$B> yeah you have to come if you decide to divorce will take a long process First you go to your mother-in-law You tell her why you want you don't want this man anymore in your life If she can't settle the thing you have come to the state you might just go back to your place to your mother's place if you go now the <O/> would come to your parents' home From then on you can sort things out and problems but and you can't go back  
<$A> now like let's say there are some cases whereby men take brideprice to be like binding and so they can beat you any time they're drunk they can send you home any time you 
<$B> no on that basis I'd rather not have brideprice
<$C> surely now it's become a punishing bargain because you never feel good
<$A> <slang/>'coz every time you do something they want to be paid brideprice or to get some proof when you didn't go and cut the tails from the goats like if RRRif RRRif you punishing him because of the brideprice you paid then reduce them So you go home and cut the tail from the goats so it becomes less for a cow so that I'm worth what I am 
<$B> is it a sort of idiom 
<$A> it's an idiom
<$C> it's an idiom
<$B> it's an idiom yeah you go and cut the goat
<$C> cut the tails
<$C> cut the tails so it is the worth that will count
<$B> my worth I'm worth what I am
<$A> okay
<$C> you do have to count that you bought him We are equal
<$B> but nowadays people don't pay with goats You go with money and other things
<$C> it's commercialised
<$A> it's commercialised It's a business
<$B> yeah sure
<$C> the more daughters you have it is the rich person Yeah in fact most  African><+_Africans> now the men nowadays they'd rather have daughters than boys as opposed long time when you get a daughter you go and throw it in the bush you don't want to reduce your <O/> In my country giving back two daughters only is supposed to give back two sons also
<$A> sounds very expensive
<$C> land you have to give them land
<$B> you have to provide for that brideprice
<$C> yeah you have to pay the brideprice In fact your father pays for you the brideprice
<$A> and let the other party I understand that is the lady who pays
<$B> the lady pays for the man and RRRand it's the lady who's the called head of the house
<$C> the head of the house 
<$A> why not no that you think to RRRto want to dominate
<$B> no it's however much I'll want to dominate I still want to see the man as the man not as the one I bought
<$C> still yeah like you can BBByou canRRR go anytime according to how you want it you can leave until you go plus the brideprice I don't want this is just the worst state he doesn't want you he doesn't want his bride rice back so you know that really is no way is no doubt about it he does not want you back
<$B> he does not write to you a word anymore
<$C> yeah or he brings another a second wife and then he says say I paid the brideprice at your home what is wrong with me paying brideprice at another home 
<$A> he gets all has all the money They can marry as many wives as they can depending on how much money you have Provided you can pay bride price it is okay You can even marry ten in the age of the grandchildren it's okay 
<$C> in fact the worst thing of the old man wanting to marry the young You know you marry someone that is younger than your own children much younger
<$B> much much younger
<$A> just because you know you have the women have no say in this you know
