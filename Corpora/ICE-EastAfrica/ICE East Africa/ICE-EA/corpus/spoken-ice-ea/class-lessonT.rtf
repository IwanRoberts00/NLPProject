\par <$B> <#/>Scramble means fighting for something

\par <$B> <#/>Scramble is }{\b\v <+_article>}{ competition against somebody
\par <$A> <#/>Yes you are some of you not far from the really <O/> <#/>At least there are ideas in there that is <#/>Maybe to put it clear Scramble is <O/> }{\b\v <&/>coughing}{
 or a competition or a struggle for something <#/>Now when you come to the term scramble for East Africa t<#/>his means the struggle for acquisition of territories in East Africa by the European powers <#/>And what about 
\par }{\b\v <&/>knocking}{
\par <$A> <#/>Come in <#/>And what about partition <#/>Yes
\par <$B> <#/>Partition means dividing the <O/> parts
\par <$A> <#/>Partition means dividing the 
\par <$B> <#/><O/> parts
\par <$A> <#/><O/>}{\b\v one sentence}{<O/> Okay by definition or partition it's also clear that to <?/>straight <#/>Do you have any idea
\par <$B> <#/><O/> division
\par <$A> <#/>Okay
\par <$B> <#/>Partition is a process of dividing an area according to the given or <O/>
\par <$A> <#/>O
kay you have advanced more than the previous one <#/>Okay maybe to put it clearly <#/>It's more or less the aim that is partition is the division when we refer to East Africa partition is the division of territories by the said given powers <#/>Now the pa
r
tition I mean the scramble and partition of East Africa took place as I told you before that it took place different from that of Africa <#/>So it took place for only about sixteen years <#/>It took place from eighteen eighty-four to ninteen hundred <#/>T
h
is is eighteen <#/>Now let us <-_>let us<-/> now see the causes or the major reasons for the scramble and partition <#/>Because we have seen that scramble and partition <#/>The European powers they are just scrambling for something for acquisition of some
thing <#/>Now what we have to mention is the reason for this scramble and partition <#/>We can have some of your views before I add mine
\par <$B> <#/>They <-_was><+_were> finding area for for investment and raw material
\par <$A> <#/>Yes
\par <$B> <#/>for their industry 
\par <$A> <#/>okay <#/>Yes <#/>What do you say <name/>
\par <$B> <#/>They were struggling for markets
\par <$A> <#/>For markets <#/>My colleague here has said areas for investment and raw materials }{\b\v <&/>knocking}{ <#/>Come in <#/>Another reason <#/>Yes
\par <$B> <#/>Cheap labour
\par <$A> <#/>Cheap labour <#/>Can you find the other one <#/>Yes
\par <$B> <#/>Markets for manufactured goods
\par <$A> <#/>Markets }{\b\v <&/>writing on blackboard}{
 <-/>Markets for their manufactured goods <#/>Now you have mentioned these reasons <#/>They are obvious but they all fall under the major reason which is titled the industrial revolution <#/>Now these are the demands which are created by the industrial re
v
olution <#/>That means as you read from the previous topic that there was the rise of the industrial revolution and this industrial revolution in Europe created a lot of demands and these are some of the demands which they wanted <#/>That is the European 
c
ountries wanted to acquire these demands in Africa and in East Africa <#/>So this is one of the <-_reason><+_reasons> as to why the European countries came to East Africa to acquire colonies or territories <#/>Another reason is the rise of monopolies <#/>
T
hat means the European countries wanted very much as <#/>The European countries wanted to acquire colonies in Africa and other parts of the world due to their ambition <#/>By then there was an ambition of European countries <#/>Most European countries <./
>want wanted to acquire colonies <#/>It was just as as we can say a prestige <O/> <#/>If some a certain country will be having a colony then it will be called a big nation }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 <#/>So this can we we can put <-_>we can put<-/> it here that the rise of
 monopolies as one of the major reasons <-_German><+_Germany> Britain I mean Italy by then and other European countries were struggling very much to acquire colonies together with Portugal as you read from the previous topic about the agents which were se
nt to Africa and the other parts of East Africa the explorers <#/>All these were agents <#/>They went there to see the potentiality or the potential of the land which will be explored in Africa }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 <#/>As we have can we have another reason so far if at all you can see or you can think about it <#/>Yes
\par <$B> <#/>The increase in population in their countries
\par <$A> <#/>The increase in population <#/>Somebody said that but to defend it needs a lot of explanation <#/>I may explain it just to put it clear <#
/>That is by eighteen eighty-four or by the century seventeen the seventeenth century it was there was a rise of population in Europe <#/>And the <-/>the population was much to the extent that these areas for investment let's say to establish plantations 
w
as very difficult <-_>was very difficult<-/> because the areas were all populated <#/>So the rise of population in Europe caused <-/>caused the European countries to send some of the <-/>the <-/>the population to come to Africa and other parts of East Afr
ica so that they can reduce }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 but this reason is always taken as a minor not major essential <#/>But it is one of the reasons due to the fact that once people were running bankrupt that means they didn't have money and they decided to <-/>to <-/>t
o come to East Africa so that they can be employed <#/>You know if a country is having a lot of population }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ then definitely there will be no employment <#/>But the employment by then were }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 only available in East Africa to run the admi
nistration administration activities and other uh employment or occupation <#/>So this population can be one but mind you if you put it as one of your reasons you must defend it thoroughly It needs a lot of explanation <#/>Even now by the moment I have ex
plained it in a short way <#/>But I think these are some of the reasons for the scramble for and the partition }{\b\v <+_of>}{\v  }{East Africa }{\b\v <&/>writing on blackboard}{
 <#/>The other reason which I may put it is that Britain by <./>eigh <-/>by eighteen eighty-four was already having the territories of Egypt and the Suez Canal }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 <#/>So as you know Egypt is using a lot of Let's say the population of Egypt is only centred along the river Nile <#/>So definitely the river Nile is essential to the lives of the popula
tion of Egypt <#/>Since then Egypt was using efficiently that river Nile and you know definitely that the river the source of the river Nile is East Africa and some parts in Somalia around Ethopia but a lot of water comes from East Africa <#/>When Egypt I
 
mean Britain controlled was running or <O/> Egypt then Britain is so essential or was responsible <#/>Actually it was just pretending as if that <#/>She was just <-_>she was just<-/> pretending as if that since we have taken Egypt we must also take parts 
of East Africa which the source of the river Nile comes from <#/>So we can put it that Britain wanted monopoly in East Africa since it had already occupied Egypt }{\b\v <&/>writing on blackboard}{
 Britain wanted monopoly in East Africa because she has already occupied Egypt }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ which use the source of the <-/>the river Nile which of which the source of the river Nile }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 is where <#/>In East Africa <#/>So that is these are among the reasons which you find but these are the major ones <#/>These are some books which are trying to explain }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 some other reasons but they tend to <-/>to mix up <#/>For instance the industrial revolution has got these reasons as independent but we can put them together as or we can arrange them adjacent <#/>Now we hav
e seen the reasons for the scramble for and the partition <O/> <#/>I want to go to the partition process <#/>As I told you that the partition process in Africa was somehow different from the partition of Africa <#/>Now the partition of East Africa went th
r
ough the mainly we can say two processes through the agreements of three countries namely Britain Germany and the Sultan of Zanzibar <#/>But for the agreements which we can consider now is <#/>We can consider two agreements that made for the partition of 
East Africa <#/>The first one is <./>Anglo Anglo-Germany Agreement of eighteen eighty-six and }{\b\v <&/>writing on blackboard}{
 the second one is Anglo-German Agreement of nineteen hundred <#/>Now let me show you how the partition was by using a map which I drew <#
/>The reasons for their agreement was of course that to settle their problems so that they cannot they can no longer go on scrambling or struggling for acquisitionof <-_colony><+_colonies> or territories <#/>They decided now the following British <-/>Brit
i
sh took the Kenya mainland except some parts that are indicated on the map <#/>This is Kenya but Uganda by then was not colonised or taken by any country <#/>It was free <#/>You remember the kingdoms were still dominating there <#/>For instance Presidents
 <name/> <name/> <#/>I mean <name/> etcera <#/>And <name/> together with <name/> was taken by Germany <#/>This is what they agreed <#/>The coastal strip this is }{\b\v <+_article>}{
 ten-mile coastal strip together with Zanzibar and in the following towns <nmae/> <na
me/> Mogadischu and <name/> <-_was><+_were> taken by the Sultan of Zanzibar <#/>This is what they agreed for the first Anglo-German Agreement of eighteen eighty-six <#/>For the first for the second Anglo-German agreement of eighteen I mean of nineteen hun
d
red they agreed the following <#/>This is the map which was obtained by eighteen <#/>I mean nineteen <#/>It is by eighteen nineteen nineteen <./>hund nineteen ninety-four <#/>I'm sorry <O/> <#/>This is nineteen hundred by nineteen I mean nineteen nought f
o
ur <#/>So they agreed the following but for this agreement the second agreement the Sultan of Zanzibar was no longer considered <#/>That means Britain took the whole part of Kenya Uganda together with the previous part which was obtained by the Sultan of 
Z
anzibar <#/>That is Zanzibar <#/>Zanzibar was now always given a certain part as is shown it is shown on the map here but this part was also under control under the control of though the capital of Zanzibar was given this part it was also under control of
 
the Sultan <#/>I mean the <-/>the British <-_German><+_Germany> was now given the whole mainland of Tanzania today <#/>So I say <-_German><+_Germany> was given Tanzania <#/>How do you take this all this <#/>I'm now waiting for your questions about the log
ic as a whole but I have a few comments on the <O/> }{\b\v <&/>background noise}{
 agreement which was <-/>was <?/>settled <#/>I was discussing with the previous uh class when they introduced another topic I mean another point they showed Helgoland <#/>This you may h
ave read this Helgoland or you have you may have read this Helgoland Treaty <#/>This Helgoland is just an island in the North Sea <#/>Do you know the North Sea where it is <#/>Where is it <#/>Anyway the North Sea is just near the Greenland in <-/>in near 
<
#/>It's near Greenland <#/>So it just an island in the North Sea <#/>Helgoland was by then not taken by either Italy or other parts I mean other countries except it was being scrambled by British by the British and the <-_German><+_Germans> <#/>So during 
t
he Anglo-German Agreement of nineteen hundred they decided that this part of I mean this island should be taken by the <-_German><+_Germans> <#/>That's why in other literature or in other books you find the Anglo-German Agreement of nineteen hundred is kn
own as Helgoland Treaty or Helgoland Agreement <#/>Now I allow you to ask questions
\par <$B> <#/>So you have said the second agreement the Sultan he was she was not <-_>she was not<-/> involved }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
\par <$A> <#/>Yes
\par <$B> <#/>Why with the first agreement he was very involved 
\par <$A> <#/>Yes
\par <$B> <#/>while the first agreement he involved Sultan }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ <#/>I don't know why
\par <$A> <#/>I have said that for the first time he was very much involved just because when }{\b\v <+_article>}{
 <-_German><+_Germans> came as I showed you on the map here he was <?/>apported a big actually a vast land <#/>So when the British and the <-_German><+_Germans> came they were supposed to consider also the area to be taken by the Sultan of Zanzibar <#/>Re
member the Sultan of Zanzibar Said Said shifted the capital from Mecca or Muscat 
\par <$B> <#/>Yes
\par <$A> <#/>Muscat
\par <$B> <#/>Yes
\par <$A> <#/>Okay Muscat to Zanzibar in the eighteen forties <#/>So it was this was very somehow very very very near or it shows when thi
s scramble for and partition by of East Africa by eighteen eighty-four by the European <./>count by the European powers then it shows this is far away from eighteen forties when the Said Said shifted his capital <X_>}{\v 
 So it means here that the capital was alread
y in Zanzibar and the bulk of this area was already occupied by the Sultan of Zanzibar So when they came when the Britain the British and Germans came they had to decide which share to be taken by the Sultan of Zanzibar }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{\v 
 and they agreed as I sho
wed you But during the second agreement they decided now to <-/>to neglect or to ignore the Sultan of Zanzibar just because by then the Sultan of Zanzibar was taking let's say a lot of products let's say coconuts cloves and he sent to Europe So Europe was
 the master of the Sultan of Zanzibar So during the second agreement they didn't consider him He was <?/>denied just like a child
\par <$A> <#/>Yes
\par <$B> <#/>So why did the scramble and partition in <./>Afr <-/>in East Africa differ from other places <O/
\par }{\b\v <&/> bell is ringing}{\v 
\par <$A> <#/>There is only one <-_>there is only one <-/>reason That is when the scramble for and partition of Africa came this was just during the Berlin conference That's why I asked you have you read anything about the Berlin Conference The Ber
lin Conference was the term or was just the term of how <-_>of how<-/> the African country I mean the African continent could be divided So when they came to East Africa they had <./>fi found already they found already the Sultan of Zanzibar was there So 
t
he Berlin Conference said it should take Tanganyika the Germans should take Tanganyika uh India should be taken <-_>should be taken<-/> by the British But the area was already occupied by the Sultan By then they started to scramble in a new phase So they 
started to scramble again and what they did they had to settle and make some agreements so that they can know everyone that who is to move where Is it clear 
\par <$B> <#/>Yes
\par <$A> <#/>Another question Any other question So the whole topic is clear If no question is placed <_O>}{\b\v two or three words}{\v <O/> of all what we are discussing today and you will be ready to answer my test So <-/>so if you 
\par <$B> <#/>I don't know as I see in your diagram there I haven't seen Burundi and Ruanda <O_>one sentence<O/>
\par <$A> <#/>So you want it to be put here or here
\par <$B> <#/>Yes 
\par <$A> <#/>By then generally you'll find that's the whole country There was no boundaries }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{\v  which would be let's say just after Lake Victoria you see the boundary like this These were the borders which 
were put just after some years after the partition So this these are that's why I <-/>I decided not to put the clear borders of these but they decided only to take shares by marking let's say rivers and there were <-_>there were<-/> no clear borders but f
o
r the case of Ruanda and Burundi as you can see on the map here it was also taken by the <-_German><+_Germans> by the but later on the French <-/>French people came to take it especially finally after the Second World War We know that the Germans were <-/

\par <$B> <#/>Yes 
\par <$A> <#/>That is where you can trace the <O/>
\par <$A> <#/>So then we can also cite our example to Egypt 
\par <$B> <#/>during Pharaoh
\par <$A> <#/>Egypt during Pharaoh <#/>Egypt during Pharaoh there was a kind of feudalism there <#/>So in the in terms of
 the expressions of our friend that there was no strong centralised power <#/>Do you get the point that Ghana has a weak centralised power <#/>Can you take the point that <O/> kingdom was or was not a centralised kingdom <-/>mhm
\par <$B> <#/>Centralised kingdom
\par <$A> <#/>It was
\par <$B> <#/>A centralised kingdom 
\par <$A> <#/>What about Egypt during Pharaoh
\par <$B> <#/>A centralised
\par <$A> <#/>It was centralised
\par <$B> <#/>Yes 
\par <$A> <#/>So in the case of Africa one can take a point that these kingdoms which we can refer giving
 examples were highly centralised but even our friends in Europe the <-/>the mode of production didn't encourage the centralisation the strong centralisation of state because if this was the land owned by one feudal lord <#/>This is the land <#/>You may t
ake an example that this land is <#/>There are routes somewhere <-_towni><+_towns> and the other portion nearby this is taken by another feudal lord so those people were leaders of these particular places <#/>Okay 
\par <$B> <#/>Yes
\par <$A> <#/>And once you cross t
his particular place you will find that some rules guiding that particular place <#/>And once you go to the left you'll find another different kind of rules guiding that particular place <#/>If it is just paying tax or tributes you will pay tribute in thi
s
 place or be <O/> a feudal lord or you'll also go on paying at <-/>at least in <./>ei <-/>in each <-_>in each<-/> feudal lord you give a tribute until you reach the place you'll stay <#/>So that's how our friend can substantiate his point that there was n
o
 strong centralised state <#/>There was no one who was at the <O/> <#/>Okay there was no one who was at the <O/> like the kings of <O/> <#/>So that's how we can deal with that one <#/>Anything which you may think that our friends' presentation is lacking 
or you make corrections <#/>Anything <#/>Okay another thing I think our friends did not discuss
\par <$B> <#/>}{\b\v <&/>inaudible}{
\par <$A> <#/>Louder please
\par <$B> <#/>They defined the term feudalism but they haven't explained the cause of this feudalism
\par <$A> <#/>The cause 
of feudalism <#/>What our friend is trying to say is that that group which presented didn't show what was the mode of production just above or just before feudalism so those of you that presentation started without introducing us what was the former mode 
of production }{\b\v <&/>writing on blackboard}{ <#/>What was the former mode of production before feudalism 
\par <$B> <#/>slavery
\par <$A> <#/>So those guys didn't show us that feudalism took place after slavery <#/>Okay <#/>Starting from the beginning what do you think were the reasons for the salient reasons for the collapse of feudalism <-_>of feudalism<-/> the salient reasons leavin
g those minor reasons <#/>What were the salient reasons which led to the collapse of feudal mode of production <-/>mhm <#/>Who can try <#/>Yes
\par <$B> <#/>Increase of population and the growth of society
\par <$A> <#/>There was an increase of population <-/>mhm <#/>Yes <#/>Once you refer to Uganda you find that it was highly populated and there are some reasons why it was highly populated <-/>mhm <#/>Another reason <#/>That's one
\par <$B> <#/>Increase in size in wealth 
\par <$A> <#/>Accumulation of wealth <#/>That is another point that people started to accumulate wealth and to privatise some kind of property <-/>mhm <#/>Another reason Another thing you <-/>you may think was the major reason for the collapse

 <#/>There was no surplus <#/>How could the lack of surplus facilitate the collapse <#/>Can you tell <#/>How did absence of surplus facilitate the collapse

\par <$A> <#/>So what was the outcomes }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ <-/>mhm
\par <$B> <#/>Let me <-_>let me<-/> finish <#/>When the hunger happened there were some people who were owning the surplus and so people who were <O/> they came to them }{\b\v <&/>inaudible}{

\par <$B> <#/>Specialisation
\par <$A> <#/><-/>mhm You tell me this is a reason for collapse

\par <$A> <#/>No there was no specialisation <#/>How did you tell this
\par <$B> <#/>Specialisation is the a what a communal mode of production 
\par <$A> <#/>A communal mode of production
\par <$B> <#/>Actually uh there was specialisation but after that specialisation c
ame into the into another stage whereby other specialisation didn't it didn't benefit some group of people <#/>For example there were some groups who were only uh <-_>who were only<-/> gatherers while others were toolmakers so we can see that the toolmake
rs became somehow somewhat <#/>They had wealth so the groups started
\par <$A> <#/>Do you get the point of what our friend is saying 
\par <$B> <#/>Yes
\par <$A> <#/>So this specialisation created an ample room for some people to own means of production and others not for
 those for instance those <O/> who gathered <O_> three or four words<O/> because they didn't settle after all they were just moving here and there looking for what they can consume <#/>While these ones who settled uh involved themselves in some activities
 such as those ones our friend have mentioned }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 so there was now creation of surplus <#/>Any other thing you can see that that can be the reason <#/>Now let me give you a question <#/>We still have some tribes in Tanzania such as Masai and we have

 <#/>Yes I asked you to go and prepare some answers but then before you start presenting your answer I mean presenting I would want to explain to you what themes are <#/>When you read any work of art be it a novel a

\par <$A> <#/>Now <-/>now that you know what themes are and what <./>character uh characterisation is I think you are abl

 <#/>The first theme <#/>Yes his good mates I think you can try to assist him <#/>You can assist him because he is not supposed to speak alone <#/>You have to work as a team <#/>Yes uh <#/>The first theme yes <#/>What has he mentioned as the first theme

\par <$A> <#/>}{\b T}{he theme of dilemma good <#/>What <-/>what is there <#/>Very good <#/>What is there in the theme of dilemma uh <#/>What makes it a dilemma <#/>What is a dilemma <#/>Actually I think you know what a dilemma is <#/>Yes <#/>Who can t

\par <$B> <#/>Traditional education
\par <$A> <#/>Traditional education <#/>That is something that causes a dilemma part of the <./>mai character uh traditional education <#/>What does it do <#/>What does traditional 
education do to cause a dilemma uh <O/> <#/>Can you tell us what the tradition does <#/>I mean what traditional education does to Ato in such a way that he's found a dilemma
\par <$B> <#/>It makes him argue with his wife 
\par <$A> <#/>uh yeah <#/>So dilemma you know what it is <#/>When Once a person is pulled on both sides <#/>When a person is pulled on both sides uh <#/>Say he has got to achieve this and he has got to achieve this one here so he is standing here inbetween uh 
<#/>He can't go in that way in the other way and that way <#/>He <-/>he wants to go to this direction at the same time he wants to even maintain this direction <#/>So this is you are saying western culture isn't it }{\b\v <&/>grammar/tag}{
 <#/>Western education }{\b\v <&/>writing on blackboard}{ education and then here you have what else here <#/>You have traditional customs isn't it }{\b\v <&/>grammar/tag}{
 <#/>So actually this is Ato <#/>He doesn't want to offend his parents <#/>Okay and at the same time he doesn't want to do away w
ith western education <#/>This actually keeps him in dilemma uh <#/>So you see and uh what makes it that I mean who can try to justify this dilemma uh <#/>Where is it said like this uh <#/>Where do we see ever expression indicating dilemma of that sort uh
 
<#/>I think you mentioned it <#/>You mentioned somewhere if I was fully aware <#/>You mentioned uh something like when uh Ato's mother brought the snails uh uh as a reward to her uh <-_>to her<-/> <-/>her children uh and what did Yurani say uh uh regardin
g those rewards <#/>What did Yurani say <-/>say uh
\par <$B> <#/>}{\b  }{She <-/>she was disgusted
\par <$A> <#/>She was disgusted and she <-/>she rejected those snails and they said after all seeing snails and eating snails are two different things <#/>I may have seen snai
ls at home in <-/>in United States but it doesn't mean I have eaten them <#/>So she threw them away isn't it }{\b\v <&/>grammar/tag}{
 <#/>So uh but when Ato is asked about this incident what does he say <#/>He tries to defend the United States <#/>After all he does
n't know how to cope with them you see <#/>So that means trying to defend what western culture because uh Ato's mother thought that all those rewards could be accepted without any question <#/>But you see uh they are rejected altogether <#/>And then here 
a
gain he tries to defend western culture <#/>And now again on the other example what does uh <#/>You mentioned it also that Yurani is married <#/>She hasn't <-_>she hasn't<-/> given birth to any child <#/>Okay <#/>And now what does uh uh what do the <./>pa
r I mean Ato's uh relatives say about this <#/>What do they say <#/>Yes the group neighbours
\par <$B> <#/>They want to wash the womb
\par <$A> <#/>They want to wash Yurani's womb isn't it }{\b\v <&/>grammar/tag}{ <#/>And what does he <-/>does <./>Yur <#/>Is Yurani ready I mean ready to be washed
\par <$B> <#/>No
\par <$A> <#/>She is not ready <#/>Okay <#/>But then what does Ato say about Yurani's barrenness <#/>Is he happy about the situation uh <#/>What does he say
\par <$B> <#/><O/>
\par <$A> <#/>He might have said Oh what's wrong with my wife
 <#/>So he doesn't agree with the concept of washing you know the idea of washing uh Yurani's stomach and what not <#/>After all uh both Yurani and Ato don't find it barrenness anyway<#/> They say they haven't yet decided to get the kid isn't it }{\b\v 
<&/>grammar}{
\par <$B> <#/>Yes
\par <$A> <#/>That's what they said <#/>So again we find even in a certain instance where Ato I mean Yurani insults uh Ato's relatives <#/>What does she say about Ato's uh relatives brothers and uncles uh <#/>Yes
\par <$B> <#/>They are uncivilised
\par <$A> <#/>They yeah <#/>She says they are uncivilised <#/>And what does Ato do uh responding to such kind of a thing 
\par <$B> <#/>He slaps her 
\par <$A> <#/>He slaps her <#/>So you see this is another <O/> you know <#/>Despite the fact that there is love between Ato 
and uh Yurani they <./>th <-/>they reach a point where Ato defends Yurani and at the same time uh Ato uh tries to even grow negative against Yurani <#/>For example when he <-_>when he<-/> slaps her uh <-_>when he slaps her<-/> <#/>This indicates that he i
s
 angered with what he was saying okay she was saying <#/>So this is a dilemma he doesn't know where to go <#/>He wants to go this way but he fails <#/>He wants to go that way he fails <#/>So he is somewhere inbetween <#/>Can you tell me another another th
eme <#/>That was one theme <#/>Another theme <#/>Yes
\par <$B> <#/>the theme of}{\b  }{conflict
\par <$A> <#/>Yes very good the theme of conflict <#/>How does uh <-_>how does<-/> the author uh explain uh this theme <#/>How does he explain the theme <#/>Can you tell me uh <#

 <#/>Then there is a theme of conflict <#/>What is said o
n this theme of conflict <#/>Yes I think you have read this uh and I told you to go and prepare this <#/>Yes <#/>What uh does the author say uh to show the conflict that is found in the in the book <#/>Think if you got uh yes
\par <$B> <#/>It started from the time they returned to the village
\par <$A> <#/>Yes uh <#/>Just as Ato visits I mean Ato and his wife decided to go back to their village is when we see uh the conflicts <#/>But what do this uh what is the conflict all about uh <#/>I think you remember that ther
e is <#/>This Ato is a Ghanaian who has uh got a European I mean Western education <#/>Okay <#/>And then his wife also is a graduate also <#/><-_>He<+_She> completed his her <-/>her uh degree course there in America isn't it }{\b\v <&/>grammar/tag}{
 and now uh Yurani is he's an Afro-American isn't it }{\b\v <&/>grammar/tag}{
 and then Ato is a Ghanaian person <#/>So once they come back from their workplace they come to pay visit to their village Ato's village we find that from the beginning that the ways that the ways of life
 that are there in Ato's village are different from the ways of life that are in America you see <#/>And this is what makes Ato uh fail to even cope with the lifestyles of the village there and it also makes Yurani very uh difficult to understand these th
ings }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ <#/>So he throws away those snails <#/>Okay it's one sign of conflict <#/>And then uh what else do we see <#/>She insults <-_>she insults<-/> uh Ato's parents <#/>So we see the conflict between traditional }{\b\v 
<&/>writing on blackboard}{ again it
 is traditional ways of life ways against <-/>against western ways <-/>ways of life <#/>But then if I asked you uh if I were to ask you can you tell me uh what are those traditional ways of life found in Ghana for example can you mention them uh as far as
 your understanding is concerned <#/>Can you try <#/>What are the traditional ways of life there in Ghana uh <#/>What are those traditional ways of life <#/>Yes
\par <$B> <#/>Barrenness is treated there
\par <$A> <#/>Yes barrenness is treated as a case <#/>Actually i
t's treated as a case and it's not even well taken in that society <#/>So they believe that once people are married they should bare children <#/>They don't have any idea of you know family planning and so on <#/>Any other things <#/>Thank you <#/>Any oth
er
\par <X_>}{\v <$B> <#/>The idea of birth <-/>birth control
\par <$A> <#/>The idea of birth control is non-existent you see uh What else You can mention many things example staple food uh how they eat how they dress how they uh behave <O/> social affairs found in you know Ghana uh
\par <$B> <#/>Women are not allowed to drink or smoke
\par <$A> <#/>Yes women are not allowed to drink or smoke but Yurani does smoke and drinks uh and this surprises uh Ato's parents isn't it }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{\v  What else Yes
\par <$B> <#/>Women are not allowed to sit while the men are standing
\par <$A> <#/>Women are not allowed to sit while the men are standing So men should sit first and women should sit later If there isn't any seat they should remain standing You see Then what uh and then you see Yurani used to sit while
 the men were standing outside So this was taken as a misbehaviour }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{\v  isn't it }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{\v 
 uh Okay So uh all these western ways of life such as those of sitting smoking drinking uh were treated uh very well by you know uh Yurani and then Ato was p
artly involved in those old uh traditional ways of life and then even modern ways of life or European uh ways of life So this uh brings a conflict or these two ways uh uh conflict <-_>to<+_with> <./>on each other Are we together Okay Now uh can we move on
 to another thing since our time is so limited Let's go to characterisation the group supposed to present on characterisation Can you speak up please

 Ato's wife and his <O/> The boy and the girl acted as two children in a village the boy being the ghost of Ato's former self Conclusion All of these are involved in action <O/> There is a close relationship among all these characters
\par <$A> <#/>Thank you very much Paul <name/> That's a good condensation Anything else to add on that presentation We have heard that there are how many characters
\par <$B> <#/>There are many of them
\par <$A> <#/>There are many But how many are they because we know their number I think
\par student:}{\b\v  }{\v Thirteen
\par <$A> <#/>Thirteen isn't it }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{\v  And uh Paul has been able to point out uh how many main characters 
\par <$B> <#/>two
\par <$A> <#/>Two Who are those
\par <$B> <#/>Ato and Yurani
\par <$A> <#/>Ato and Yurani isn't it }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{\v  uh And then we see two boys uh two persons uh a boy and a girl who are just like what uh They look like Ato's own self isn't it }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{\v 
 but split into two parts Okay You remember where he was saying that uh where where should I go east or west Something like he wants to go to Ghana but he fails He wants to go to
\par <$B> <#/><name/>
\par <$A> <#/>uh <name/> and fails What's the <O/>
\par <$B> <#/><O/>
\par <$A> <#/> <O/> he fails too So this is a dilemma all the same but we see that uh Yurani and uh Ato dominate as main characters Okay And uh of course these two women what are these two women doing these two women the first woman and the second woman
\par <$B> <#/><-O>}{\b\v two or three words}{\v </O>
\par <$A> <#/>They are gossiping
 You know to gossip Talk about other people's affairs uh even though it's in the in the village people's habitants Okay So they talk about Ato's family and they talk about Yurani as though they are very much concerned with their <-/>their lives So do you 
all have this habit of gossiping talking about the other people's affairs Do you do that
\par <$B> <#/>No
\par <$A> <#/>I think most of you do gossip especially
\par <$B> <#/>girls
\par <$A> <#/>No I haven't said girls It's you who have said it Girls do gossip right
\par <$B> <#/>Yeah
\par <$A> <#/>You agree that you gossip
\par <$B> <#/>no no
\par <$A> <#/>uh I know You cannot get me neither can you refuse S you are somewhere inbetween You are in a dilemma too Okay Any question on characterisation Any question Do you have a question there So is i
t clear uh on themes and and uh the characterisation Very clear uh <name/> It seems uh you have a question
\par <$B> <#/>No
\par <$A> <#/>You don't have a question No question Now suppose I ask you a question uh Suppose uh <name/> for example if you were Yurani what
 could you have done uh as far as snails are concerned and whatever Would you have eaten those snails No uh Would you have smoked uh and uh have <-_drank><+_drunk> some beers and what whisky before the Ato's parents your husband's parents
\par <$B> <#/>Yeah
\par <$A> <#/>Yeah}{\b\v  }{\v You would do that uh Suppose Karamoto you were Ato What would you have done against uh Yurani's not throwing away those snails uh You have kept quiet or you have reacted against that }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{\v 
 You could have reacted uh by beating her
\par <$B> <#/>no no
\par <$A> <#/>uh
\par <$B> <#/>I said no
\par <$A> <#/>You'd have beaten her uh Gilbert suppose you were Ato and uh uh Yurani threw away those snails uh Could you have kept quiet on that
\par <$B> <#/>because I love her I just give her a warning }{\b\v <&/>class laughs}{\v 
\par <$A> <#/>yes yes
\par <$B> <#/>because I love her I just give her a warning
\par <$A> <#/>uh because you love her you just give her the warning You can't slap her at all 
\par <$B> <#/>No
\par <$A> <#/>Who said they could slap her Throwing my my parents' uh presents away as though it was rubbish Actually this in the end deserves something uh So all of you uh because it's she is your lover you cannot uh grow harsh to her and keep quiet isn't it 
}{\b\v <&/>grammar}{\v  Now suppose uh you were Yurani now and I come to you Alice If you were Yurani if uh Ato slapped you just like the way Ato did to her uh <-/>to <-/>to <-/>to Yurani what could you have done
\par <$B> <#/>I slapped him too
\par <$A> <#/>You slapped him too
\par }{\b\v <&/>interruption
\par }{\v <$A> <#/>uh because time is out by first of all I want to thank all of you although it has not been yes
\par <$B> <#/>}{\b\v <&/>inaudible}{\v 
\par <$A> <#/>to call the first
\par <$B> <#/>the first woman and the second woman the boy and the girl minor characters
\par <$A> <#/>uh certainly in fact excluding Ato and Yurani the rest are the minor charac
ters all of them The major characters are those two and the rest are not are in the category of minor characters So you are right when you say the first woman the second woman and who is the other the boy and the girl all those are minor characters includ
ing Ato's relatives including the man and the old woman Thank you that's a good question Okay with that I thank you for your uh lovely participation although today uh you seem tired
\par <$B> <#/>after lunch
\par <$A> <#/>After lunch oh I see I understand that uh another thing is that you are not very well informed about this It has been so <O/> Thank you all the same and uh thank you our guest for having been with us
\par <$C> <#/>Thank you very much

 class production relation and modes of production <#/>Class production relation and modes of production <#/>So we shall start directly to define some concepts in this topic <#/>The first concept we should define is production

\par <$A> <#/>Yes come in
\par <$B> <#/>Good morning Sir
\par <$A> <#/
>Good morning <#/>So this topic is very important because any human being any human <./>bei <-/>human being needs in order to survive he needs three main things or in order to survive he needs three essential things <#/>What are they who can mention one <
#/>Yes <name/> 
\par <$B> <#/>Food shelter
\par <$A> <#/>I said who can mention one <#/>Okay food <#/>The other <-/>mhm
\par <$B> <#/>Shelter
\par <$A> <#/>Shelter <-/>mhm <#/>The last
\par <$B> <#/>Clothes
\par <$A> <#/>Clothes <#/>Good <#/>So all these will basically come as a result 
of work or as a result of labour <#/>So human being in the first time of his existence he found that he was <-/subjecteded> to the work and he was therefore in an attempt to struggle against two things <#/>In the first place the first human being struggle
d against }{\b\v <&/>stool pushed}{\v  }{two things }{\b\v <&/>writing on blackboard}{ <#/>Who can try to mention one thing things maybe the first human struggled against mmh
\par <$B> <#/>Struggled to get food
\par <$A> <#/>Struggled to get food <#/>Struggled to get food
\par <$B> }{\b\v <&/>door opening}{\v  }{Good morning Sir
\par <$A> <#/>Good morning <-/>mhm <#/>Another thing <#/>Yes try
\par <$B> <#/>He struggled to change his environment
\par <$A> <#/>struggled to change his environment }{\b\v <&/>writing on blackboard}{ struggled to change his environment <-/>mhm <#/>Now what can we do with these things is that the first man struggled in the first place against nature <#/>Okay }{\b\v 
<&/>writing on blackboard}{ <#/>He struggled against nature and struggling against nature is where the results of <O/> today }{\b\v <&/>stool pushed }{<#/>That human being had to survive and surviving needed }{\b\v <&/>lexeme}{
 him to <-/>to possess food and to possess food needed }{\b\v <&/>lexeme}{ him to involve himself in labour to produce so that he can gain some food <#/>So that was in the first place <#/>In the second place m
an was subjected in a position to struggle against his fellow man his fellow colleague <#/>So you find that man was subjected to nature and to his fellow man <#/>So after that is when after finishing that then we can proceed with giving some divisions to 
our terminologies or concepts
\par <$B> <#/>Please Sir
\par <$A> <#/>Yes
\par <$B> <#/>You have said that the man struggled against nature and then secondly his fellow man 
\par <$A> <#/>Yes
\par <$B> <#/>his fellow man how
\par <$A> <#/>Okay this man <#/>Anyway secondly before going back to answering the question of our fellow explained }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 who can try to think about how man can struggle against man <#/>Who can try to find something how man can struggle against another man <-/>mhm <#/>Anyone who can try <#/>Okay this man has to struggle to get relations }{\b\v <&/>writing on blackboard}{\b 
 }{<#/>Okay <#/>Relations between man or between man to man or relations among men <-/>mhm <#/>Who can tell me that all the members of the class are his friends <#/>Is there anybody who exists who can tell m
e that all of <-/>of these members of class are his friends}{\b  }{is it }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
\par <$B> <#/>Yes
\par <$A> <#/>They are your friends
\par <$B> <#/>Yes
\par <$A> <#/>But you definitely must have a friend of yours who is closer than others isn't it }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ <#/>That is one kind of relation <-/>mhm <#/>That's one kind of relation <#/>Am I wrong
\par <$?> <#/>No
\par <$A> <#/> That is one kind of relation <#/>But in the other way you will have some members of your class who}{\b  }{not like you }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{\b  }{or not love you }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{\b  }{<#/>Not necessarily that they can show you that they}{\b  
}{don't love you but they are there and they don't love you <#/>So that is still a relationship isn't it 
\par <$?> <#/>Yes
\par <$A> <#/>So you have all kinds of relationship <#/>So in the first place there was the human being had to struggle to get }{\b\v <+_article>}{
 harmonious or friendly relationship uh to his fellow man <#/>In the second place these people as they went on producing they found themselves that some were having new products others were not having products }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{\b  }{
And I don't think if there is a good relationship or friendly relationship between the one who is rich and the one who is poor <#/>Is that not true <#/>Do we have harmonious or friendly relationship between those two <./>pe kind of people
\par <$?> <#/>No
\par <$A> <#/>We don't have <#/>So these people were struggling against harmonious relationship which later has resulted into the formation of disharmonious or unfriendly relationship <#/>I think I have answered the question
\par <$B> <#/>Yes Sir
\par <$A> <#/>Any addition }{\b\v <&/>someone clearing his throat}{\v  }{any addition because I might have left }{\b\v <&/>lexeme}{ some <-/>some points and people who feel that I have left }{\b\v <&/>lexeme}{
 some points they can add <#/>Is there anything else I have forgotten <#/>So we said that two productive forces I think and probably it is definitely true that this is not the first place or the first time you see this terminology isn't it }{\b\v 
<&/>grammar/tag}{\b  }{<#/>I presume that this is not the first time you see this terminology <#/>Who can try to define what are the productive forces }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{\b  }{<#/>Who can try to define what are the productive forces }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
\b  }{<-/>mhm <#/>Who can try <#/>Anybody <#/>Yes <#/>Try
\par <$B> <#/>Productive forces in my consideration I consider that they are those facilities used in production
\par <$A> <#/>Good try <#/>Anybody who can try <#/>Anybody else who can try <#/>What are the productive forces }{\b\v <&/>writing on blackboard}{ <#/>What are the productive forces <#/>Yes }{\b\v <&/>stool pushed}{
\par <$B> <#/>I hope productive forces are those factors which are concerned in the creation of material
\par <$A> <#/>Yes }{\b\v <&/>stool pushed}{\v  }{<#/>It's very good <-/>mhm
\par <$B> <#/>Productive forces are the forces which are used in production of materials
\par <$A> <#/>Very good <#/>Okay I think through or by obse
rving those three views we can simply say that man has necessarily to live basically depending on producing food uh preparing shelter for his uh protection and clothes <#/>So because he wants these things he has to involve}{\b  }{himselves  }{\b\v 
<&/>grammar}{\b  }{to find }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{\b  }{
the productive forces things that can facilitate him to obtain these things <#/>Okay <#/>So productive forces are the things which can facilitate the activity of man to achieve these uh three essentials <#/>Any other view concerning the productiv
e forces <#/>Who can mention any way <#/>Who can try to give the examples of the what can be productive forces <-/>mhm <#/>I'm not interested in the one hand <-/>mhm <#/>Yes try
\par <$B> <#/>Land
\par <$A> <#/>Land <-/>mhm
\par <$B> <#/>Human labour
\par <$A> <#/>Human labour }{\b\v <&/>writing on blackboard}{ <-/>mhm Try

\par <$A> <#/>Capital }{\b\v <&/>writing on blackboard}{ <-/>mhm <#/>Any other example <#/>Yes

\par <$B> <#/>Specialization
\par <$A> <#/>Specialization <-/>mhm <#/>I <-/>I <-/>I saw another hand just behind you <-/>mhm <#/>Somebody was raising his hand <-/>mhm <#/>So 
\par <$B> <#/>Yes Sir
\par <$A> <#/>Yes
\par <$B> <#/>I think you do have <O/> which are which is the productive process but I think some of us have given a lot of definitions but we're coming to this <O/> where you <-/>you have been saying that yes we co
uld try try try but we don't know which is new 
\par <$A> <#/>about productive <./>for forces
\par <$B> <#/>Yes because I don't know which because there were great divisions so I don't know which is which 
\par <$A> <#/>I think in the after the definitions of from your colleagues I said that productive forces are things which facilitate the <O/> <#/>Okay So I said isn't it }{\b\v <&/>grammar/tag}{\b  }{
<#/>Only that you say you were busy so that you I said that productive forces are the things which facilitate a}{\b  }{
human being to acquire or obtain his basic needs <#/>You remember <#/>So it is for <-_>it is<-/> not for the benefit of our friend but even those that are <O/> here <#/>So after having seen what we can say about product
ive forces let's try to find some other possible concepts within the major concept of productive process <#/>There is one concept under productive process which is human labour <#/>Human labour <-_>Human labour<-/> <#/>I think human labour is supposed to 
be the component of the productive process <#/>It is the component or it is just one one among many which compose the productive process as in the definition some of our colleagues }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{\b  }{
where I said that enterpreneurship specialization all those kinds will be found in the course of our discussion on human labour <#/>So who can try to tell what can be uh what you can say about human labour or in terms of defining or giving some sort of ex
pressions what you can say <#/>What can you say about human labour giving expressions or descriptions or even if possible to tell the definition <-/>mhm
\par <$B> <#/>Human labour we can say is refered to as the form of work in production
\par <$A> <#/>The form of work in order to produce <-/>mhm <#/>Okay <#/>He has given such a definition <#/>Who can try Another one who can try <-/>mhm <#/>Another else }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ <#/>Try
\par <$B> <#/>Human labour is energy or ability 
\par <$A> <#/>Energy or 
\par <$B> <#/>ability
\par <$A> <#/>ability <-/>mhm 
\par <$B> <#/><O/>
\par <$A> <#/><-/>mhm Yes <#/>Okay human labour includes or in the first place human labour <#/>Yes }{\b\v <&/>door opening}{\v  }{<#/>labour is a purposeful or is a <./>purpos a purposeful or intended activity done by human being }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{\b  }{
which depends on a skill or man experience scientific and technical knowledge <#/>So human labour is as I have said is an intended activity done by human being }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{\b  }{and it is basically depending on skill experience }{\b\v 
<&/>writing on blackboard}{ <./>experi experience uh and scientific and technical knowledge }{\b\v <&/>sheep/goats bleating <&/>writing on blackboard}{\v  }{
<#/>For all those ones who might not have heard it properly it is an intended activity directed at the production it is an intended activity directed at the
 production of the necessary product and it is solely dependent on these factors skill experience scientific and technical knowledge <#/>Anybody who has a different concept or a different idea uh <-/>different idea from those ones which are given on the b
lackboard <#/>Anybody else who has something to add or something to express in addition to the subject <#/>Anybody <#/>So this one is clear <#/>It is clear
\par <$?> <#/>Yes
\par <$A> <#/>So after that let's go to another concept }{\b\v <&/>writing on blackboard}{ <#/>Objects
 of labour <-_>Objects of labour<-/> <#/>Who can try to think about what is what can object of labour mean <#/>Who can try to tell us what he feels this can be <-/>mhm <#/>Anyone who can try <#/>Yes

\par <$A> <#/>Yes any other <#/>Any other <#/>Any other <#/>Try <#/>You can try <#/>Who else can try <-/>mhm <#/>Are you satisfied with the <-/>the expressions of our colleague <#/>Are you satisfied 
\par <$B> <#/>Yes
\par <$A> <#/>So you want to say that what your colleague was thinking you as well were thinking it isn't it }{\b\v <&/>grammar/tag}{\b  }{
uh <#/>Who was seriously thinking another way different from <-_>different from<-/> our fellow's expressions <-/>mhm <#/>So you were thinking the same thing all of you is it }{\b\v <&/>grammar/tag}{\b  
\par }{<$B> <#/>Yes
\par <$A> <#/>uh Who was thinking the other way round <#/>Tell what you were thinking or what you think <#/>Tell what you think <#/>Yes
\par <$B> <#/>Object of labour are facilities to which the human skill and experience are directed
\par <$A> <#/><-/>mhm This is another fair definition <-/>mhm <#/>Someone was raising his hand <#/>We contribute various views
\par <$B> <#/>Object of labour includes man and his <O/>
\par <$A> <#/>Yes and still other views are here mh <#/>Any other contribution <#/>Yes
\par <$B> <#/>I think object of labour is any human activity to maximize production
\par <$A> <#/>To maximize production <#/>Okay <#/>Objects of labour are the things which are subjected to man's labour <#/>Objects of labour are the things which are subj

\par <$B> <#/>Land is one of those
\par <$A> <#/>Land good <#/>Land is something which is subjected to man's labour <#/>Good <#/>So land is the most important object of labour which is subjected to man <-/>mhm <#/>Who has some other views different from these ones <-/>mhm <#/>Is this clear 

\par <$?> <#/>Yes
\par <$A> <#/>It's important to note that these objects of labour are the things which are subjected to man's labour <#/>A good example is land <#/>Okay
\par <$?> <#/>Yes
\par <$A> <#/>Let us shift to another <-/>another concept <#/>This is means of labour }{\b\v <&/>writing on blackboard}{ <#/>I hope you can see what I write <#/>You can see
\par <$?> <#/>Yes
\par <$A> <#/>Means of labour <#/>If we have discussed about }{\b\v <&/>prep}{ human labour objects of labour what can be an appropriate expressions }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 for means of labour <#/>What can be an appropriate expression for means of labour <-/>mhm <#/>Means of labour <-_>Means of labour<-/> <name/> <#/>Yes

e
 working with different groups of people <#/>For example if you are working with children you wouldn't have uh acid as acid or alkali things like sodium hydroxide or nitric oxide things like that because kids are liable to taste anything placed in front o

\par <$B> <#/>Thank you very much indeed to them they are uh all teachers all of them together <#/>All of us here are participants <#/>Well before going actually what into what I'm expected to <-/>to present here first of all I\rquote 
ll have I must say thank you to all participants <-/>participants for good work that we have come out after four or five days of interruptions here between people and people between people and material <#/>They have been very active interactions and I
\rquote m sure the <-_unit><+_units> that have been written now will come out as uh documents that will help us in our work later in the classrooms when we go back into our schools and I\rquote 
m sure that these documents uh <#/>The office will work uh extremely hard t
o have them out as soon as possible so that uh we can use them as uh reference materials to our work in the schools <#/>So with that I must say thank you to all participants uh <#/>It is actually all of us here who are facilitators it was beyond our expec

<#/>It might also that <-_>It might also<-/> be that some of us have applied this approach in our 
day-to-day teaching and also it is possible that some of us have never used this approach in our teaching in the classroom <#/>So we tried to give a questionnaire <#/>We gave a questionnaire yesterday and uh thirty-three people responded to that questionn
a
ire or in other words evaluation form and I tried to go through the questionnaire and tried to summarize what you yourself commented on what you did in five days <#/>So the most interesting question to me and probably to my colleagues also were <#/>Do we 
h
ave a specimen of that questionnaire <#/>What did you like about this workshop and what you didn't like about this workshop <#/>These were very very important questions to us here as facilitators and they were also very important questions to you yourself
 participants but unfortunately uh most people didn\rquote t respond much in this uh <#/>Some people just put dash in that <#/>Some people say what you did like about this yes and what you didn\rquote t like about this workshop no <#/>That doesn\rquote 
t tell us anything or we have to investigate into that <#/>We have to do more inquiries into those answers <#/>Actually they couldn\rquote 
t help us much in getting a feedback from you actually <#/>Those were very important very crucial questions to you that we were expecting you to respond <#/>But however some gave their responses and I\rquote 
m quite happy to read them before you and the first question what did you like about the workshop <#/>I translated <-_>I translated<-/> that question into another form why we need inquiry <#/>Why we need 
inquiry approach <#/>It is almost synonymous to that why what did you like about this workshop <#/>Definitely you will point out a number of issues a number of things that interested you while you were in this workshop beside those of meals tea break and 
other things jokes that were highlighted during the presentations during the discussions during the workshop <#/>So the first }{\b\v <&/>interruption}{\v  }{
<#/>they are the main source of inquiry approach <#/>All those that said you liked them definitely they are the go
od side of the inquiry approach <#/>And in other words we can say those are the merits of the inquiry approach <#/>So listen to your response on the inquiry approach <#/>What did you say about it <#/>What are <-_>What are<-/> the good sides of the inquiry
 approach <#/>You say one it facilitates exchange of materials ideas }{\b\v <&/>writing on blackboard}{
 <#/>This is what you have said <#/>It facilitates exchange of ideas and materials and that is very true <#/>We have been exchanging ideas in the groups while doin
g activities and also during presentations we have been all the time we have been most of the time exchanging ideas and material between ourselves as learners because we are all learners <#/>You said that learners become creative }{\b\v 
<&/>writing on blackboard}{\b  <O_>}{\b\v two or three words}{\b <O/>}{
 and actually you were very very creative <#/>You were designing <#/>You were devising all sorts of methods ways and means to solve problems <#/>For instance today here this morning these people demonstrated to us how they could m
easure the size of the image to the size of the object <#/>That is creativity <#/>Maybe some of us we didn\rquote 
t know before how actually to measure that but there is just a simple method using ruler and pencil to measure the size of the image and the size of the object <#/>That is clear <#/>Then they said students }{\b\v <&/>writing on blackboard}{ }{\b <O_>}{
\b\v two or three words}{\b <O/>}{ <#/>Of course as you have said that syllabus has to be consider they are very long and I think they have been <#/>So actually of course when you go back to your schools you won\rquote t teach you won\rquote 
t select topics from nowhere <#/>You will be selecting topics from your syllabus <#/>So at least we are happy that you know this that you will have to consider your syllabus so we are in a very good position <
#/>Another thing is arrange participants on subject-based groups but very few commented on this <#/>I think only one or two <#/>Arrange participants on subject-based groups <#/>Well actually one of the tricks of the inquiry approach is to facilitate learn
i
ng between the learners <#/>You as a facilitator the teacher you have to facilitate learning between the groups so for instance here in this workshop we say okay you sit as biology teachers you this group as physics teacher this group as maths teacher <#/
>So the biology teacher has given light the topic light <#/>I think it won\rquote t have been appropriate actually in giving }{\b <O_>}{\b\v two or three words}{\b <O/>}{
 <#/>But the way you were you were sharing experiences <#/>One who knows gives his experience or her experience or that is shared to those who maybe didn\rquote 
t have that idea <#/>You discuss round that idea <#/>So the sharing of experience is very vital in the inquiry method and }{\b <O_>}{\b\v two or three sentences}{\b <O/>}{

t the initial stage the stage when you are prepared the stage when you are learning how to use the inquiry approach but once you are familiar with the approach and you already know what you want to do then time consumption becomes very much excess <#/>Tha

w

\par <$D> <#/>Dear teacher have you attended any science workshop before
\par <$E> <#/>On my part I have attended <-_>I have attended two times<-/> in eighteen eighty-nine as well as in nineteen ninety-two 
\par <$F> <#/>This is my first time to attend this science workshop 
\par <$G> <#/>On my part this is the second time to attend this science workshop <#/>At one time it was in eighteen eighty-nine and now it is nineteen ninety-two ninety-three
\par <$D> <#/>Do you think that this workshop is useful to you and the society in general
\par <$E> <#/>On my own behalf I think that this workshop is very useful to the student as well as to the society because it makes the student or one who <-_>take<+_takes> this method learns }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 by observing the specimen given learn how to raise <-_question><+_questions> }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 as well as planning how to experiment the experiment then experimenting <#/>In doing so he learns by creating direct experience and skill from the specimen provided 
\par <$D> <#/>How
\par <$E> <#/>By doing such experiments by himself <#/>He learns by creating direct experience from the experiment he is performing or he is experimenting 
\par <$D> <#/>Do you have any suggestions on the improvement of the science workshop in the future
\par <$F> <#/>uh yes I have suggestions <#/>First of all science workshop should be carried at least twice a year and instead of having one zone in one region we should sub-divide one region into areas <#/>For example in this North Pemba region we should have
 at least two zones whereby the workshop to be conducted }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ <#/>Second instead of just assembling secondary schoolteachers we also try to also <-/>to include primary schoolteachers because also science begins at the primary level
\par <$D> <#/>Is the approach applicable to <./>you <-/>to your students
\par <$F> <#/>Yes this approach is very applicable to students <#/>Though it has some defects on it but by learning the learner gets a permanent learning <#/>Since he is doing the experiment by himself he is le
arning how to observe he is trying to formulate or to frame out the question how to frame a good question so he is learning and he is getting a very permanent uh learning and what he <-_do><+_does> or what he does or what she does stays for long time in h
i
s mind <#/>Though it has some difficulties <#/>For example the teacher or the conductor of the experiment sometimes who <./>ha he has to have a good financial strength or financial constraint though the method is taking a longer time as well as in our cla
ss we have a dense population so in order to do <./>su such the teacher has to look forward on these three problems <#/>Then he can do it but it's very applicable and it is a very good approach 
\par <$D> <#/>What do you comment on the inquiry approach
\par <$E> <#/>
Science is a process and science is also a progress meaning we have to leave out the old traditional method and try to follow the modern method <#/>One of the modern <-_method><+_methods> the discovery of better right the inquiry method <#/>This should be
 conducted in schools first of all as Mr Khamis said it's makes }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{\v  }{
learning permanent and also the modern way of teaching is to make pupils or students participate in the lesson <#/>So inquiry method welcomes students to take part in the lesson <#/
>So they do things by themselves uh <#/>When doing things by themselves it takes longer time to forget than just traditional method of just chalk and talk on the blackboard <#/>Students or pupils can cram the facts and they can take them to the examinatio
n and pass but the examination is over and the facts are also over <#/>The inquiry method can substitute the old method
\par <$D> <#/>What other approach do you know to science teaching
\par <$G> <#/>Okay <#/>Well in science teaching the other methods in science teaching are lecture methods and project methods 
\par <$D> <#/>Do you have any other comments
\par <$G> <#/>Okay to contribute more comments I request the facilitators to organise visits to different schools that have attended this sort of <./>cour this short course to
 see how far this inquiry approach is being applied by the science teachers and where they come across any problem or difficulties they <-/>they deserve to give a helping hands to motivate and encourage the science teachers <#/>This will make room for mor
e science teacher to adopt this modern approach of science teaching in both primary as well as in secondary schools </I>

 and observe from their stalks and the result was we have seen the leaves divided into two <-/>two groups <#/>There are some leaves have }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ leaves stalks and others have not <#/>For example a diagram shown }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 these are the leaves having leaves stalk and one among those was not bear }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ leaf stalk like this one and we also do more observation from leaf stalk and we have seen that some of the stalk }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 are slender and look like sponge <#/>However uh another part leaf base }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ and parts were having }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ some holes inside <#/>Tha
t is hole <#/>When you say leaf with no margin there is no margin <#/>Also if you observe <ea/>Mvinja have no edge like others }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
\par <$E> <#/>Only one drawing is what you have labelled a leaf stalk <#/>What you have labelled are those leaf stalks
\par <$J> <#/>Yes leaf stalk and leaf base
\par <$E> <#/>Yes this is a leaf base and this is a leaf stalk
\par }{\b\v <&/>laughter}{\b 
\par }{<$B> <#/>And uh some papers and some other materials are back there so the problem is to find out all you can about the features that are there
\par <<$O> questions were what the materials are provided <#/>Number two What are the properties of materials provided <#/>Number three What are the dimension }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ of the different shape }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 <#/>Number four What are the sizes of angle }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ of different shape }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ <#/>Five What are the lengths of different shape }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 and six I'm sorry here there was a slip of pen <#/>It should read What other shapes can be obtained from the given shape <#/>Number seven Can we make congruent figure }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ from the given shape <#/>Number eight Can we make similar shape }{
\b\v <&/>grammar}{ from the given shapes <#/>So we were supposed to answer question number six <#/>What other shapes can be obtained from the given shape <#/>Here was the question num
ber six <#/>We have <O/> and pentagon by using a triangle and a square <#/>That is one shape which we form
\par <$?> Okay we can confirm
\par <$O> It is known a pentagon}{\b  }{\b\v <&/>lexeme}{ because it has got five sides <#/>Another shape which we <-/>we could have obtained from other shapes is we have use we have make }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 a partial structure <#/>From this we use one <./>hex <./>hex hexagonal shape structure with six triangles <#/>One hexagon with six triangles shape and a star <#/>Another shape was we use four squ
are four squares such as this one this one one two three four and then we use four rhombus two rhombus and two triangles and two trapezium <#/>We obtain a twelve-sided figure which the name of it which we couldn't get it }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 only the name of a twelve-sided figure
\par <$?> <#/>make further investigation
\par <$O> Further investigation okay <#/>Another figure which we have obtain }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ or another shape which we have obtain }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ is a pentagon using a square between two triangles one square between two triangle }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 <#/>This is one triangle and this is one triangle and this is a square <#/>Another figure which we obtain is an octagon <#/>We arrange four trapezium }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ <#/>These are trapeziums and four triangle }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ and a square <
#/>We end up with an octagon an eight-sided shape <#/>Another one was a decagon or a ten-sided figure by using four parallelograms two square two rhombus and one trapezium and one triangle we remain up }{\b\v <&/>lexeme}{\v  }{
with a <?/>decagon <#/>The last one we do was a <?/>hectagon an eight-sided figure by arranging three triangle }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ 
\par <$?> <#/>Seven
\par <$O> <#/>How many Seven-sided figure by arranging three triangles two parallelograms and a square <#/>We get a seven-sided figure which is known as <?/>hectagon and that is all
\par <$A> <#/>materials provided is pawpaw }{\b\v <&/>grammar }{baobao fruits orange grapes tomatoes uh the given fruits eaten by man
\par <$D> <#/>By using litmus paper blue and red identify the this is an activity identify the acidity and the alkalinity of a fruit <#/>We get many fruits are acidic
\par <$E> <#/>pawpaw baobaob fruits orange grapes tomatoes <#/>We squeeze the juice of each fruit and the juice of each fruit is added to the benedict solution in a test tube and then heated
\par <$O> <#/>Time for presentation uh I hope uh <#/>What we understand is that each group has given some part of the presentation in order to overcome the repetition
\par <$P> <#/>Our topic is fruit uh material provided pawpaw tomato orange coconut peas lime banana leech grapes baobaob fruit 
are the fruits provided in each group <#/>Number three All fruits provided have some the same internal structure <#/>Number four Do all fruits have the same taste <#/>Number five What will be what will happen when given fruit solution tested with A litmus
 paper B universal indicator C <?/>milo reagent D will answer question number three and question number four <#/>Question number three is do all fruits provided have the same internal structure <#/>Now we are talking about }{\b\v <+_article>}{
 internal structure of 
fruits which must be first of all a cutting and observing the internal structure of the fruit provided <#/>Now in our observation we know uh we see fruits have the same internal structure e g orange and lime tomato and <ea/>tunguja uh <#/>These fruit }{
\b\v <&/>grammar}{ have the same internal structure like this <#/>This is orange and this is lime <#/>Inside contains }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 seed <eh> and softer uh like this <#/>They divided into layers like that and <ea/>tunguja uh and lime also <#/>Now tomato and <ea/>tunguja
 also the same <#/>We get seed many seeds internal and <ea/>tunguja also and some fruits are different in their internal structure e g pawpaw <#/>The internal structure is if you cut the pawpaw we can see like this <#/>This is internal structure very soft
 <#/>This is uh part <#/>This is }{\b\v <+_article>}{ external part <#/>Now the internal structures of peas <-_>the internal structure<-/> of peas <eh> like that <#/>There is seeds internal like this and then the internal structure of banana }{\b\v 
<&/>grammar}{ <#/>There is some seeds }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ inside and baobaob fruits like this <#/>There is a seed
\par <$B> <#/>Now we are inviting questions additions or comments uh anything
\par <$A> <#/>While describing something for instance the position when we mean when we say the seeds are at
 the centre <#/>What do we mean by the seeds are at the centre and how are how they are arranged at that centre at that particular centre <#/>Are they arranged longitudinally or things of that sort <#/>The way they observe to cut they cut the orange acros
s
 section it definitely shows they are at the centre but only at a point and actually they are located longitudinally along the axis so this is a sort of observation that we have to make while observing the materials <#/>We have to be specific in describin
g how the thing is rather than at the centre
\par <$Q> Right and I emphasize that if you want to see the arrangement of a seed you must specify which ways of cutting so you can see the arrangement of seeds cutting longitudinally <#/>Also you can see another arra
ngement of seeds when you cut vertically <#/>So you <-/>you <-/>you don't keep it as you say just arrangement of seeds <#/>In what position of cutting is important
\par <$R> <#/>My colleague <-_say><+_says> the <-_seed><+_seeds> are concentrated more at the cen
tre <#/>Actually he means that the seeds are not found at the centre because when we say concentrated we mean that the seeds they may be at the centre and others will be a little bit away from the centre <#/>That is why he refer concentrated }{\b\v 
<&/>lexeme}{ }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 because most of the seeds they are found at that region <#/>They are not at the centre <#/>They are found in that region meaning that region and if you want to prove that we can cut an orange in any direction you will notice that most of the seeds
 are very near at the centre }{\b\v <&/>prep}{ <#/>They are concentrated very near to the centre <#/>That is my point 
\par <$S> <#/>Okay introduction first <#/>The materials are selected to be given the participant or say the students <#/>The type of material given wil
l depend upon the level of the students or participants or however <#/>So the reagents the food test reagents were given to the teachers because we assume that teachers know about the food tests and the litmus papers were given because we guess that was t
o
 be given <-_in><+_to> Form One students <#/>Form Two students Form Four students different available materials will be given <#/>For example if the material is to be conducted in Form One we shall <O/> these for Form One students first there should be an
o
ther one activity beforehand for the use of the reagents for example <./>differ different food substances will be given to students and they were allowed to play with reagents in each food reagent <#/>As a result the teacher then will tell or the if you r
ead on the reagent on to this type of food }{\v <&/>}{\b\v sense}{\v  }{<#/>It <-_mean><+_means> this type of food is starch or this is protein and something like this <#/>So you have to consider about }{\b\v <&/>prep}{
 the materials given to the students <#/>The level of the <-_>of the<_/> students of the learners will lead to the choice of material to be presented during their activities <#/>So we should not quarrel
\par <$F> <#/>underestimate the students because they can do something which you don't know <#/>So then we decide to give the things to the student we should understand uh I say this they want to they can do the wonderful things so let them do it }{\b\v 
<&/>grammar}{ <#/>And you are the teacher <#/>You have to live after this <O/> over but under inquiry approach we have to think very ca
refully on actually what we want to see and that can be facilitated by the question <#/>When you frame good questions then it is much easier for you to do investigations and when you frame bad questions then it is very difficult for you to make investigat
ions <#/>What I mean here we have good questions and we have bad questions you see <#/>So we have to be very conscious on }{\b\v <&/>prep}{
 the questions that we have to frame so as to lead us into observation <#/>We have to be very careful uh <#/>And that also will
 be the same <-_to><+_for> the students whom you are going to teach <#/>They will be framing questions <#/>It is better that when they are framing their questions you go around the groups and help them to modify those questions <#/>Definitely they must ha
ve an idea that they want to observe but it might be very difficult for them to frame a good question a good observable question so you have to go round them and <-/>and help them reframe their questions so that they will be given to investigation </I>
