\par }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <$A> <#/>Hello and welcome dear listeners to Investment and Trade in Tanzania <#/>The Tanzanian Tourist Board TTB has embarked on }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 ambitious project to boost up tourism in the country <#/>Besides attracting more tourist to visit our country Tanzania the board <-_intend><+_intends> to classify or categorise some hotels that cater for tourists <#/>This was the message from the 
managing Director of TTB Mr Credo Sinyangwe to local journalists at the Dar es Salaam International Airport immediately after TTB boss had arrived at}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057

this edition of Investment and Trade programme in Tanzania we'll bring you the first instalment of three <-_programme><+_programmes> in which Mr Credo Senyagwe outlines the highlight of his tour in Europe
\par <$B> <#/>Fellow Tanzanians it is a pleasure to be b
ack home to this great lovely country of <-/>of fantastic people like yourselves <#/>When I was abroad I met a number of tour operators wholesalers retailers and so on <#/>They were all very excited about Tanzania as the coming new destination <#/>Many of
 
them shared a viewpoint that really Tanzania is the best kept secret among the upcoming destinations <#/>So we have a lot to offer in terms of our attractions in terms of our culture our wonderful people <#/>One thing that became very obvious to me when w
e
 were speaking with people starting in Lisbon at the <?/>Aster Conference they all said they've been here before <#/>Then you ask them when <#/>They say in the early seventies <#/>So something happened between the early seventies and the early nineties <#
/
>Maybe we fell asleep a little bit and now we are waking up <#/>So we should wake this sleeping giant to roll again in the world of tourism <#/>So the rest of the world can count on us can expect the best that Tanzania is known to be offering <#/>We flew 
a
round Mount Kilimanjaro this morning <#/>It was magnificent <#/>Everybody says what a beautiful country you have <#/>They talk about Zanzibar our sister country <#/>They are very excited about Zanzibar the magical Zanzibar the spice island of Zanzibar the
 
culture of Zanzibar the beaches of Zanzibar <#/>They are very very excited <#/>They talk of Ngorongoro Crater <#/>They talk of the Serengeti <#/>They talk of the migration <#/>I was in Paris the other day and we visited a museum movie presentation almost 
i
n three dimension they showed Serengeti <#/>That place has been full since six months ago everyday <#/>It's very difficult to get a ticket <#/>Its capacity is about seven hundred people so Tanzania is popular abroad <#/>The number of things that we feel m
u
st be done back at home most of which don't <-/>don't demand or require excessive resources <#/>Most of them are legislative <#/>Most of them are policy matters <#/>I think we should not delay a minute in moving right ahead in removing the obstacles that 
n
ow face our industry <#/>One of them the visa issue the tourist visa issue <#/>Many of them said it's very difficult to obtain a tourist visa because you are not all over the world <#/>Tanzania is not well represented throughout the world so for many peop
l
e who want to come to Tanzania it's a struggle <#/>I'll give you my own experience <#/>Before going to Portugal it demanded director of marketing presence in Nairobi for an interview <#/>He came back <#/>It demanded one of our tourist officers going back 
t
o Nairobi to get the <-/>the stamp the visa stamp so with all that we started saying Mr Mwengua and myself maybe it's not worthwhile going to Portugal <#/>So you can imagine somebody who wants to spend a lot of money uh after having worked very hard for m
a
ny years saved some money wants to come and see our wonderful country <#/>I think we can facilitate by removing the tourist visa and if we cannot for whatever reasons that are not known to us here we could require that on arrival <#/>When you arrive at Da
r
 es Salaam Airport Kilimanjaro Airport Zanzibar Airport you get your visa right there <#/>No questions asked <#/>The days of checking for weaponry for spies and so on are really over <#/>Most of the world is trying to get together as one country <#/>Look 
a
t the European Union <#/>Even the conservative Sweden has joined in the European Union <#/>Look at America Canada Mexico <#/>So these are indications that we should learn from others as much as they learn from us <#/>You remember the days of <O/> Zambia Z
i
mbabwe they all followed the good example of our <-_>of our<-/> father of the nation President Nyerere <#/>So now we should also learn from others <#/>We shouldn't have our head stuck in the sand as they say <#/>We should always research see what are the 
b
est strategies to improve our tourism <#/>And at the conference we met with Richard Branson <#/>He is the chairman and owner of uh Virgin Atlantic Airways <#/>We made a special request <#/>We invited him to Tanzania <#/>We said come and help us develop ou
r
 tourism <#/>As you know uh a very important aspect of tourism is accessibility <#/>We've very few planes very few seats per year <#/>Now when you have very few seats from very few airlines like Air France KLM Ethiopian Airline and so on you cannot uplift
 
so many people to your country <#/>You only have that much capacity <#/>So we spoke with Richard Branson specifically <#/>We spoke with Intercontinental Hotels <#/>I met a colleague of mine from Cornell University uh Mr Roger Kakuu who is now regional vic
e
 president of <-/>of Intercontinental <#/>He was very very uh pleased to hear that we are inviting them back to this region and he said he will do whatever he can to help us <#/>I spoke to <name/> a chain of hotels <#/>These are people that President Cast
r
o himself invited to Cuba and now they have more than three thousand rooms in a matter of two years <#/>So we need to continue creating that uh enabling environment facilitate uh a number of investors in hotels in airlines <./>in infrastructure superstruc
t
ure make it easier for these tourists to come to our country <#/>Currently our capacity is only about <-_>two hundred<-/> two hundred thousand tourists a year <#/>That is a very small number and that is the number of tourists who come to our country <#/>I
 
can tell you today we can handle half a million and I think from the press release you have received there'll be tremendous increase in the number of tourists of this country <#/>I mean there is a figure here of forty per cent for the UK market but I can 
t
ell you today we had about two hundred thousand tourists last year or year before in ninety-three <#/>I think in ninety-four we'll have three hundred thousand and ninety-five four hundred thousand and by ninety-six we <./>shou <-/>we should reach half a m
i
llion figure <#/>Now how can we prepare ourselves for that <#/>One we need to encourage the airlines of all kinds all charters whoever wants to come to Tanzania it's open-door open-skies welcome to Tanzania <ea/>Karibu Tanzania from wherever you are <#/>W
e
'll make it easy <#/>We'll make it enjoyable for you <#/>We need to build more hotel rooms <#/>We don't have beach hotels in the mainland although we have plenty in Zanzibar <#/>So we need to encourage uh investors to come and build more hotels along our 
b
eaches <#/>We have more than eight hundred kilometres of beach and you only find two hundred or three hundred good hotel rooms <#/>That should not be allowed to continue <#/>We should immediately relax obstacles encourage investors from all over the world
 
<#/>I met a very interesting uh tour operator who already has hotels has charters to Kenya <#/>He's called Franco Rosso a company from Italy <#/>I met uh Mr Franco Rosso himself his son and daughter <#/>They invited me to dinner and said Credo we want to 
come to Tanzania he said in Italian <#/>I said welcome to Tanzania <#/>Come to my office Mr Gamba <#/><ea/>Mama <name/> and all the other managers are at your disposal <#/>We'll facilitate <#/>If we need to see}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{

/>If we need to see uh IPC uh Mr Kahama we'll see him <#/>If we need to see uh National Parks we'll see them <#/>These are all Tanzanians interested in the economic uh betterment future of our people <#/>So we are all as a team in this country <#/>So goin
g
 back to our WTM some of the successes we have had I think we did a better showing there <#/>People liked our stand which was half the size of Kenya <#/>People were very excited <#/>There was tremendous business <#/>There were so many tour operators <#/>S
o
me of them were not even part of our team <#/>They just came and said may we participate <#/>So although fourteen of us went but we had about twenty of them who came and said I belong to Tanzania <#/>I've a tour company in Tanzania <#/>We said but you hav
en't paid <#/>He said I'll pay on the spot so they paid cash there to belong to participate <#/>So a good news }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 next year instead of fifty square metres that we had this year we will have two hundred square metres of space <#/>That's four hundred
 per cent of the current space we took <#/>We asked them to give us a central position <#/>So I would like to say uh uh fellow Tanzanians brothers and sisters we have a good product we have a great country and we have good people tremendous economic poten
t
ial <#/>Let's make the best use of them <#/>Let us not allow anyone to obstruct our progress our economic growth <#/>I think destiny is in our hands so you have a role to play in informing our public that tourism is good <#/>We have a role to play in disc

\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 which you have just come back 
\par <$B> <#/>One thing we made abundantly clear to whoever we met is that Tanzania as a country our government and its polic
y has already accepted tourism as a very important sector very important economic sector <#/>We informed them that we are excited we are eager to welcome them back to Tanzania in tourism projects of any kind to work with us in building hotels in bringing 
more airlines talk of charters of scheduled flights <X_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
We were shocked for example before we left that Lufthansa pulled out I think it was a wrong decision I think they were ill-advised and we would like to discuss with Lufthansa to welcome them back I don't t
hink it makes uh strong business sense for them to pull out when our economy especially in the tourism sector is picking up We want them to be with us as they've stayed with us for a long time during the very difficult times Some of the evidence we feel w
i
ll accrue from our meeting Many people have been <./>abandably abundantly informed of Tanzania We were so well prepared as far as brochures promotion material While we were there at least ten new ones came out Ten new brochures promotion material They wer
e
 coming from the uh woodwork you know like ants suddenly you see ten new ones We said all right hear hear this is what we want to see So people are very well informed people have been encouraged We tell them our policy is friendly tourist-friendly uh We w
a
nt them to help us come to Tanzania We know for sure Franco Rosso will be here and he is one of the major tour operators in Italy He's the most prestigious He promised he is <slang/>gonna come here Richard Branson of Virgin Atlantic promised that he'll co
m
e here Intercontinental are very eager So they said when we meet with them in uh Spain in January during <O/> Tour <-/>we they definitely want to speak with us with respect to tourism uh development hotel development So there are a number of key uh divide
n
ds from our meeting there We met with the <?/>Aster Conference President She said she promised to Mr Mwengua and myself that they'll come to Tanzania and schedule meetings Now <./>wha what is the impact of that Economic impact is one When you have people 
of this reputation wanting to come to your country they place your country vividly in the tourism map and that counts to a lot of dollars million dollars

welcome again to our quarter hour programme of African development <#/>This is a programme which discusses the economic political and cultural development of African countries <#/>Also it features the economic development of regional or sub-regional group
ings in the continent of Africa <#/>Our programme this week looks at the recent history of Sudan and its economic development <#/>Stay tuned }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>music}{\f0\fs24  
\par <$B> <#/>Sudan is generally a flat featureless plain reflecting the proximit
y to the surface of the ancient little-disturbed basement rocks of the African continent <#/>The democratic Republic of Sudan is a vast country which covers an area of two million five hundred and five thousand eight hundred and thirteen square kilometres
 and the Nile waters which enter Sudan just south of Ajuba either evaporates or flows }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\f0\fs24  }{\f0\fs24 
three thousand kilometres until they reach Lake <name/> on the Egyptian border <#/>Borders surrounding the country are Egypt Libya Ethiopia Chad Central Africa
 Kenya and Uganda <#/>Sudan has a population of over eighteen point nine million people according to UN estimates of nineteen eighty-one <#/>The capital of the country is Khartoum 
\par <$A> <#/>According to recent history of Sudan its geographical position bet
ween the Mediterranean Middle East and Central Africa has played an important part determining the character and the politics of the country since the Biblical times <#/>In almost all the contacts between Sudan and the outside world Egypt has been the mos
t important link and especially since the rise of Islam the dominant one 
\par <$B> <#/>British rule was also extended to Sudan when the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement of eighteen ninety-nine laid the foundations of the new regime in Sudan <#/>This agreement was nomin
ally Anglo-Egyptian but was actually a British colonial administration headed by a Governor General in which all military authority was vested <#/>Sudan achieved independence in nineteen fifty-five <#/>Changes of governments took place with the problem of
 the southern Sudan which was inherited from the British colonial administration of which a search for a permanent constitution of the country is yet to be found }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\f0\fs24 
\par <$A> <#/>Despite many years of development efforts Sudan remains primarily an agric
ultural and pastoral country <#/>Agriculture contributes forty per cent of the Gross Domestic Product and its <O/> produces over ninety per cent of total exports which also employs about eighty per cent of the economically active population <#/>The manufa
c
turing sector is still small and it contributed about six per cent of the Gross Domestic Product in nineteen eighty-one eighty-two <#/>Exploration for petroleum has resulted in commercially exploitable finds <#/>It was planned that by nineteen eighty-six 
t
he country would have exported petroleum thus giving the country hope that some of its crippling problems could be solved <#/>However the deteriorating security situation in the south where most of the commercially exploitable deposits of petroleum are lo
cated has raised a major question mark over these plans 
\par <$B> <#/>}{\b\v\f0\fs24 <+_article>}{\v\f0\fs24  }{\f0\fs24 Main cash crops of Sudan are cotton which is the main cash crop and its exports can reach up to seventy per cent of total agricultural exports <#/>Others are groundnuts and sorghu
m <#/>The country's dependence on one major export crop especially cotton with wide fluctuations in price and quantity exported has caused political as well as economic instability in the country <#/>With such a traditional agricultural sector it is not s
u
rprising that Sudan has a low income per head which was estimated by the World Bank to be US dollars four hundred and forty in nineteen eighty-two <#/>The average density of population is low and there is no population pressure on the available resources 
<#/>In fact Sudan suffers from shortage of labour particularly during the cotton-picking season <#/>The country is large with large unproductive areas
\par <$A> <#/>The availability of water is the governing factor for agriculture in Sudan <#/>In most parts of t
he rain lands of Sudan drinking water for humans and animals is a crucial factor especially before the <O/> season when land is prepared for cultivation and after it during harvest season <#/>The cultivable land is estimated to be about eighty-four millio
n
 hectares and only eight per cent of this land is being utilised in agriculture and about two million hectares are under irrigation using Nile waters <#/>To the Nile Waters Agreement of nineteen fifty-nine the distribution of water between Sudan and Egypt
 was governed by an agreement of nineteen twenty-nine which allocated four thousand million cubic metre of water to Sudan
\par <$B> <#/>Cotton is the most important crop in the Sudan from the economic point of view being the major export chief foreign exchange e
arner and main generator of income for the country <#/>Three main types of cotton are grown <#/>The long staple <name/> for the export market the medium staple <name/> and the rain-fed short staples <#/>The difference in the cotton is seen in the cotton f
i
bres <#/>The main cereal crop is sorghum commonly known as <afr/>duna in Sudan <#/>It is the most important staple food and it is mainly grown in the rain lands <#/>Excellent harvests during the year nineteen eighty-one and nineteen eighty-two have encour
a
ged the development of sorghum into an increasingly important export crop <#/>In nineteen eighty-two sorghum aimed earned the Sudan Sudan pounds one hundred and seven million for its export to Saudi Arabia <#/>Wheat is grown mainly as a cash crop but with
 urbanisation and social developments the consumption of bread made out of wheat flour by the Sudanese people is increasing at the rate of ten per cent annually 
\par <$A> <#/>Products like the groundnuts <O/> rice sugar cane maize are also being produced in Sudan on }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>prep}{\f0\fs24 
 a reasonable quantity <#/>Sudan has an animal wealth which contributes on average about ten per cent of Gross Domestic Product annually <#/>In nineteen eighty-three it was estimated that the country had nineteen point six million cattle nine
teen point five million sheep twelve point nine million goats and two point five million camels <#/>Also production of milk was estimated to be over one million point five metric tonnes and meat was four hundred fifty-one thousand and fifty metric tonnes 
<
#/>The share of live animals hides and skins in total export increased by from two per cent in nineteen seventy-five seventy-six to almost <O/> per cent in nineteen eighty-two <#/>However this percentage was not expected to increase as the domestic consum
ption of this commodity continues to increase at a faster rate <#/>Also the government restricted the export of animal products in order to satisfy the local market
\par <$B> <#/>As far as the industrial sector was concerned the dealing of cotton encouraged the 
beginning of industry in Sudan early in the country <#/>With the expansion of cotton production the number of ginning factories also increased until the <name/> board alone has the largest ginning enterprise <-_until><+_under> }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>prep}{

 the world <#/>There are twenty-five spinning and textile factories <#/>Groundnuts are also partly processed with oil and cake dominating exports <#/>Minerals such as copper iron mica and chromite are exported in the crudest form <#/>With the exception of
 
soap soft drinks and oil processing industries large industries manufacturing import substitutes started only after nineteen sixty <#/>Following the shift of the economy in favour of more mixed economy more of the industries in Sudan were sold to the priv
ate sector 
\par <$A> <#/>The private sector has played an important role in the industrial development of the country <#/>In the period nineteen sixty sixty-nine the private sector invested Sudan pounds thirty-six point nine million in industry <
#/>The bulk of the investment has gone into the textiles soap oil-pressing sixteen hundred <O/> industries <#/>By the nineteen seventies the role of the private sector had increased <#/>The government has encouraged industrialisation by giving generous co
n
cessions to infant industries <#/>A new encouragement of investment act was introduced at the end of <-/>of nineteen eighty repealing the previous investment laws <#/>This act offered tax incentives such as <O/> land acquisition customs exemptions and fav
ourable freight and electricity charges 
\par <$B> <#/>Since nineteen seventy-three international companies have shown an increasing interest in exploring for petroleum in the Sudan <#/>More than eighty per cent of available concessions were allocated and compan
ies working in the Sudan including Standards Oil began to increase <#/>Potential government earnings from petroleum exports were estimated at dollars two hundred million annually in December nineteen eighty-two <#/>The oil pipeline between Port Sudan and 
K
hartoum was completed in nineteen seventy-seven <#/>It is designed for the transport of motor gasoline gas-oil and kerosene including aviation turbine fuel <#/>It has a capacity of six thousand hundred metric tonnes with a length of about eight hundred an
d fifty kilometres <#/>Chrome mining was being developed and a feasibility study into off-shore minerals in the Red Sea showed considerable deposits of iron ore zinc copper and silver and these were to be exploited jointly with Saudi Arabia

\par <$A> <#/>In this aspect Mr Kilimikwo says local government should know what type of life local people are living because environmental conservation and development are interrelated
\par <$B> <#/>The issue's that these two are so interwoven they are 
so interlinked that you cannot talk of development without talking about environmental conservation <#/>It is through the environment that people are making their own living <#/>It is through the environment through <#/>It\rquote 
s by destroying or improving the 
<./>enviro the environment that the community can either develop or underdevelop <#/>Now local government what does it entail <#/>Local government means that first they have to know what type of life they are leading <#/>Are they fishermen <#/>Are they <?
/
>headers <#/>Are they agriculturalists or whatever the case <#/>It depends what type of life that particular <./>lo local communities are leading <#/>If they are farmers then they <./>ha <-/>they had to involve the farmers themselves to know what type of 
farming methods are particularly in <./>su <./>sus can lead to sustainable environment in their areas because in most these cases it has happened that there are traditional farming practices which have been practised ever since from }{\b\v\f0\fs24 
<&/>prep}{\f0\fs24  time immemorial
 and these were pertinent to that particular time but I see the changes <#/>These people are supposed to change over time but now the problem is that the so-called extension officers the <./>ca so-called central government whatever the case have been impo
s
ing uniform solutions to different problems at different localities <#/>We all need to review and that's where the local government comes in because as I have already said different localities have got different problems and that's why you cannot <./>in <
-_>you cannot<-/> pump }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\f0\fs24  farming solutions to problems which are affecting fishermen <#/>Likewise you cannot pump }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\f0\fs24 
 from the top solutions for problems affecting miners mining communities to people who are dealing with harvesting say honey
 in forests <#/>We need specific problems <#/>Their problems are different <#/>Their <-_way><+_ways> of living are different <#/>Their cultural <O/> of life are also different <#/>So there's that question of sociological looking aspect 
\par <$A> <#/>I think th
ere is inadequate public awareness about environmental issues <#/>Mr Jumo Ngasongwa Personal Assistant to the President's Office Economic Affairs says one of the critical <-_role><+_roles> of local government should be to expand awareness because they are
 nearer to the people 
\par <$C> <#/>Local governments as institutions are nearer to the people where actually the environment is or where the environmental problems are and therefore they have a very critical role to play in terms one of expanding awareness uh 
among the communities the people with whom they are living together uh to understand that the environment is a very important aspect in their development 
\par <$A> <#/>Another aspect according to Mr Ngasonga is to mobilise funds for environmental projects
\par <$C> <#/>The local government as institutions have another uh important aspect in that uh they can mobilise resources uh resources which uh they can be utilised }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\f0\fs24 
 in uh implementing uh environmental projects which uh ensure that the environment is co
nserved uh <#/>Of course I do know that uh most local government institutions are constrained by a number of uh problems <#/>One manpower two financial resources uh three uh transport facilities <#/>But uh if we as a nation <-/>we can mobilise our resourc
es and make these resources available to the districts then they will be undertaking in a very most effective manner those activities which ensure to conserve }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\f0\fs24  the environment
\par <$A> <#/>The District Executive Director for Muheza Mr Diwani Omari Mzina says that the possible way to enable local government to fulfil their obligations and thus implement sustainable development is to strengthen the functions at the district level

\par <$D> <#/>I think the local government has a lot to play }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\f0\fs24  in sustaining conservation <#/>If you take our story in the past <#/>I think we had uh by-laws in the district councils which were dealing with }{\b\v\f0\fs24 
<+_article>}{\f0\fs24  preservation of soil uh of water sources and forests but uh when you get to the new system of decentralisat
ion I think most of the by-laws were ignored and nobody cared in fact what was happening <#/>I think if that at present we need to conserve uh soil forests and so forth we need to strengthen uh the function at the local government at district level especi
a
lly the staff their working implements and the by-laws uh creating by-laws which are dealing with conservation and then after initiating the by-laws and when they are already passed you need the machinery for enforcement and a great problem which we are g
etting now is uh the enforcement machinery <#/>You can have the by-law for conservation but you don't have the machinery to make sure that by-laws are being adhered to 
\par <$A> <#/>However Mr Maisala Mbezi District Executive Director for Nachingwea says the role of local government as far as environmental conservation is concerned is great but to enable them }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <+_to>}{\v\f0\fs24  }{\f0\fs24 
work properly the revenue collected from natural resources should be given to local governments
\par <$E> <#/>As we all know local governments cover all the country and in the districts actually it\rquote 
s where we have a great number of the local people who in fact are required or are needed to contribute much in the environmental conservation strategy or poli
cy <#/>In doing so uh the local people will contribute much by using their own efforts and the council in its on its side will use some revenue from its own sources to boost the efforts of the people <#/>But what is important to be emphasised here is that
 
the revenue collected by the central government from these natural resources some small amount maybe twenty-five per cent or twenty of the whole collection should be given to the local authorities so that this money can be used in this specifically marked
 effort of making sure }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\f0\fs24  that the environmental conservation policy package is a success
\par <$A> <#/>Mr Abdalla Abdi Executive Director for Ileje district supports the idea of setting aside more funds for conservation measures and also suggests that the councils should solicit funds from the international organisations
\par <$F> <#/>I think the government should allocate more funds from the <./>bu budgetary uh allocations <#/>Instead of the twenty-five per cent being given it should be raised to twenty-fiv
e to fifty per cent and also councils should solicit more funds from donor agencies <#/>In Ileje we have DANIDA and the EEC to finance some of these projects for conservation purposes
\par <$A> <#/>Mr Alan Kijavi working with the Ngorongoro conservation area authority also had some few comments to make regarding the role of local government in environmental conservation
\par <$G> <#/>So far as I know most of the conservation efforts which are geared towards environmental protection have been failing in the past few y
ears mainly because we didn't involve the local communities concerned <#/>It is now that we have realised that mistake and that we are now trying to tune ourselves }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\f0\fs24 
 to go into those local communities and involve them in the whole process of prote
cting the environment and in such a way the only way we can work easily with the local communities is to involve the local governments concerned because they are the ones who are working for the people and they are the ones who know the problems of the pe
o
ple and they are the ones who can assist us in implementing the strategies that have been proposed in the national conservation strategy for sustainable development <#/>So I think that by working with the local government we will make this whole exercise 
I mean successful <#/>Otherwise if you work in isolation as it has previously been }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>idiom}{\f0\fs24  then I'm sure the whole strategy will end up a failure
\par <$A> <#/>But some people are complaining that the goal of local governments in environmental conservation cannot be achieved because of lack of funds <#/>Let's hear Mr Kijavi Lupia 
\par <$H> <#/>Well so far as I see it is that the people themselves have to play a role in implementing the national conservation strategy for sustainable development wherever <-/>wherever possible }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>break in recording 
\par }{\f0\fs24 <#/>I think that people will contribute using their own initiatives and 
\par }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>break in recording next cassette
\par }{\f0\fs24 their own sources of funds while the central government can finance them with more funds to implement some of th
e major activities but I as I know that people if they are willing to implement the conservation strategy then will be able to mobilise themselves and implement those issues which can be accommodated within their <-/>their main financial positions and the
ir powers to implement }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>music}{\b\f0\fs24 
\par }{\f0\fs24 <$A> <#/>On the other hand people believe that local governments can do well in implementing sustainable development if they establish co-ordination that is for example formation of environmental committees in the village go
vernment to control and effectively use our natural resources <#/>The Biharamulo District Executive Director Mr Herbert Nyamugali supports the idea
\par <$I> <#/>So far environment has been taken for granted <#/>Trees are being cut water sources are being spoil
t <#/>There are <O/> bush fires every dry season and all sorts of destruction <#/>But if every village government was held responsible to protect the environment then we think people would be sensitised and would understand their role in the preservation 
o
f nature and conserving it <#/>So I think it is pertinent to the local governments to have different committees starting at the district level going all the way to the village governments and the formation of village environmental committees which would u
h <-/>would uh play the a role of preserving nature by different mechanisms say by having village by-laws and enforcing them so that everybody knows his role in the preservation of nature
\par <$A> <#/>Masasi District has not been very much affected by environmental degradation <#/>However the Executive Director of that area Mr Mbwija Tela Malende has something to contribute on the issue of local government
\par <$J> <#/>It's my sincere uh stand that the local governments are very much uh the appropriate authorities t
o handle this uh soil conservation or whatever to bring about sustainable development because they are the bodies which are very close to the people and they exactly know the problems concerning the conservation problems in the areas and because of that I
 
think they have their <-/>their role to play uh <#/>What local authority will do will of course depend very much on the local conditions which in one way or the other affect soil conservation and things like that uh <#/>As for my district I would say righ
t
 away we don't have very serious uh degradation problems but however there are areas where the authority has to play a part especially uh things like uh bush fires <#/>They are quite common <-/>common in <-/>in Masasi District uh <#/>There is this problem
 
of shifting agriculture which has been associated with the uh programme of Ondoa Njaa in Masasi in short Onjama and uh in the near future maybe cattle might also bring some <-_problem><+_problems> <#/>However we are already aware of this and we intend to 
take some uh regional measures as soon as possible
\par <$A> <#/>Some local communities they've already started conservation measures because they know that is part of their responsibilities <#/>A good example is Ileye district <#/>As Mr Abdalla Abdi confirmed
\par <$F> <#/>We have already started conservation measures <-/> in my district and uh particularly in the tree planting and conservation of <-/>of what are source areas by damming the rivers and also by constructing water intakes
\par <X_>}{\v\f0\fs24 <$A> <#/>Then there is a proble
m of funds in making environmental conservation success The Uherewe District Executive Director Mr Festo Baruwani says local governments should be prepared to mobilise the resources for the <-_activity><+_activities> that would enhance environmental prote
ction
\par <$K> <#/>I would say that the local authorities being so near to the uh <-_>to the<-/> situation in the environmental areas namely forestry uh land use uh agriculture uh fisheries they should be prepared to orientate their thoughts and plans towards t
he <-/>the idea of conserving environment and be prepared to mobilise their resources uh for the activities that would enhance the endeavours for protecting the environment while producing sustainable development
\par <$A> <#/>However Monica Kulia town Counsellor for Bukoba Urban talks of her experience concerning environmental problems in urban areas
\par <$L>In urban areas the problem is that some areas are not properly surveyed so the people tend to <-_>tend to<-/> select a special<-_>a special<-/> area of their i
nterest and they go building there without using the land plan of the town So this has caused the problem of squatters You find the squatters they have no latrines nor <-/>nor any developed system of services such as roads water and uh the place where I'm
 <-/>I\rquote m coming from }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\f0\fs24 
 is the Bukoba Town Council where the people tend to build the <-/>the <-/>the houses in the slopes of <-/>of hills and there there is no means of where there is no sewage system for controlling the waste products from the ho
uses So if it rains the running off water tends to <-/>to collect all waste products from the hills too and uh they these products are deposited in Lake Victoria so the lake or the water lake is polluted due to this waste from the hills
\par <$A> <#/>Researchers normally discuss a lot of things and suggest too the possible solution to the problem That is the same to }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>prep}{\v\f0\fs24 
 Mr Peniheri Yetuu Chief Research Associated in Environmental Press Foundation in Arusha who comes up with suggestions to enhance the role of local governments in environmental conservation
\par <$M> In fact uh on my part I feel the local government should be given the role of uh mobilizing the people in conserving }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <+_article}{\v\f0\fs24 > environment and in implementing the <./>polit <-/>the policy matters whi
ch the government or the central government rather should uh make on environmental conservation I also feel that the local government should uh start using the farmers' training centres which have long been neglected to train environmental aspects uh In a
d
dition to that schools within their districts should be encouraged to include environmental matters in their syllabuses Furthermore I would suggest that the district councils of the local government should embark on programmes like tree planting discourag
ing uh tree felling of trees uh within their districts and also discourage shooting up }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\v\f0\fs24  agriculture
\par <$A> <#/><O/> District Planning Officer Mr Mafure Nyirende also gives out }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\v\f0\fs24  his point of view concerning the role of local government in environmental conservation
\par <$N> First of all the local governments should be aware of the environment of which it exists within its environment especially for <+_}{\b\v\f0\fs24 article}{\v\f0\fs24

Saturday the twenty-eighth nineteen ninety-five the Tanzania Leprosy Association marked the World Leprosy Day by a seminar which was held at the Muhimbili Medical Centre which was officiated by Honourable Zakia Meghji the Minister of Health }{\f0\fs24 
<#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 In her opening remarks Zakia Meghji urged joint efforts towards elimination of leprosy which has ceased to be endemic }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
There are some two point four million sufferers in seventy-nine countries with significant number of cases as Doctor Ipugi the programme manager narrates as he presents the global leprosy situation and the World Health elimination strategy
\par <$B> <#/>Leprosy is a disease with profound causing profound disability and uh deformities and these are the ones which cause it to be feared and to <./>os uh to let the communities to ostracize its uh <-/>its victims }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
Now before nineteen eighty when MDT <-_>when MDT<-/> was uh instituted the leprosy was a big problem }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 But now after MDT the treatment which has proved effective cases are going down }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
If we look the first transparency please if we look at the leprosy burden at the current time uh there are about two 
point two million cases in the world which are spread in seventy-nine endemic countries and their registered prevalency of leprosy is about four per ten thousand population }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
Of <-/>of these uh cases most of them are distributed in subtropical out uh <./>sub in the subtropics as you will see in the later transparencies }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 And about six hundred thousand cases are detected each year }{\f0\fs24 
<#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 By nineteen ninety-four it is admitted that there are between two to three million people who are disabled with the leprosy }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
The next the as I said the group of pictures here shows that the most of the cases are below }{\f0\fs24 <#/>T}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 he next one please }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
The <-_>the most of the leprosy patients occur below the uh in the subtropical belt }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 So both in America <./>Af uh Africa Southeast Asia and uh the Western Pacific }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Uh the next }{\f0\fs24 
<#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <./>Mo most of the <-_>of the<-/> patients as we said are in the Southeast Asia region as you can see in the transparency there and in Africa for nineteen ninety-four there were only one hundred and
 thirty-seven two hundred and forty-nine cases }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 The coverage of treatment by MDT which is the most effective treatment for leprosy to date ranges from uh forty-seven per cent to ninety-four }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{
\f0\fs24\lang2057 The highest uh uh <-_>the highest coverage<-/> has been in 
the Southeast Asia uh in uh the lowest coverages are in Southeast Asia and uh in Europe but uh you see in Africa uh East Mediterranean and the Western Pacific are the ones which achieved much higher coverage <?/>net uh uh coverages }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{
\f0\fs24\lang2057 The completion of treatment by MDT by that year six <./>mi more than six and a half million almost six and a half million people had been treated by MDT which gave a cumulative coverage of ninety-one point seven }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{
\f0\fs24\lang2057 Now if you look on }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 the case detection which the fig
ures for nineteen ninety-three next show that still Southeast Asia detected much more of the new cases half a million while uh Africa as you can see it was just below forty uh thousand cases }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
So the case detection rate ranges from thirty-five per cent t
o less than one per cent and as you will see in the WHO uh strategy letter on what they <./>in uh intend you can see that to reach a case detection of uh one per uh one per ten thousand <?/>well some of the countries are much uh below that }{\f0\fs24 <#/>
}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Now I would like to look in detail of }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  some of the statistics which are prevalent in Africa }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
In uh in anglophone Africa as you can see we have uh the <./>prev prevalence per ten thousand ranges from uh as low as in Kenya and in South Africa which all have r
eached the <./>eliminate elimination phase of the WHO which is defined as uh less than one case per ten thousand population or ten cases per hundred thousand population and while other countries like Liberia uh uh uh are still in a much bigger problem }{
\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 And patients on MDT or MDT coverage you can see Tanzania uh South Africa Kenya Ghana Ethiopia and uh we have <-/>have achieved a hundred per cent coverage while others like Liberia is much much lower }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{
\f0\fs24\lang2057 Now in order to achieve the elimination strategy the
 WHO set uh World Health Assembly set uh prevalence rate of one per ten thousand and because knowing that leprosy is a disease of patchy distribution which means that the uh number of cases vary from country to country or even within the country }{
\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 And <./>the therefore the strategy to eliminate leprosy differ }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  from community to community }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
And this is the grouping of the countries in the world which has been made and group one uh which has only one case at this moment it's India and is define
d as <-_>case countries with the <./>pop more than a million cases of leprosy while you go down to group five which uh have eliminated leprosy as a public uh problem }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
Now group one to three are the ones where WHO is concentrating its efforts in eliminating leprosy because they have not yet eliminated uh the leprous as a public problem }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
And uh while in the group four which Tanzania belonged in that group }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 are the cases which would eliminate leprosy if the current activities of uh combating <
-_leprous><+_leprosy> are maintained }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 So it's important that we know we are in that group and we have to maintain the current uh situation }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
This grouping is based on both uh <-_>both epidemology that's the number of cases as well as operation issues like coverage of multi-drug therapy }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Now <-/>now if <-/>if you see the next transparency }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{
\f0\fs24\lang2057 The next transparency shows just in brief the <./>num the names of the countries which are involved in those uh groups and as I said Tanzania is in group four so what we are the WHO is concentrating now is in }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
<&/>prep}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 the top twenty-five countries }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 The next and in those <./>to top twenty-five countries because we're in Africa I wanted just to look more in detail }{
\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <+_at>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 the African countries which are uh involv

\f0\fs24\lang2057 This just tries to give again an overview of the whole uh registered cases in nineteen ninety-four }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
So ladies and gentlemen this is the global situation of the <-_leprous><+_leprosy> situation in the world }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Now as I said the WHO uh decided to set the
 target of eliminating leprosy by nineteen uh two thousand in uh the year two thousand because it was found to be quite feasible }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
Especially if efforts to spread MDT are <-/>are maintained in all countries and uh we achieve a hundred per cent coverage }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Now a number of priorities were set which would assure that leprosy is uh eliminated }{\f0\fs24 
<#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 The first one or the first and foremost is the political commitment of the countries which are involved in eliminating leprosy and one of the actions they have to d
o is to set a plan of action which indicates uh what activities are going to be done to achieve the elimination }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 The actions which have to be taken is }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{
\f0\fs24\lang2057 first to identify which problems we have }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 That's uh to see the big the size of the problem and where it is concentrated }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
And that's why we look at the registered prevalence of the cases and the absolute numbers as well as the rate }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Then you have to estimate the prevalence }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 This is a very difficult }{
\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 in leprosy because we <-/>we do not have a good criteria to estimate the number of cases in the community }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
But the annual case detection rate is a very useful measure because those countries which have an established <./>progra programme would show the numbers which they are 
detecting each year and with the population you can get the rate or the case detection rate }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Uh the estimated <?/>listing also is difficult to <-/>to ascertain }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
After knowing which size of the problem then you have then you have to ensure that leprosy control services are delivered properly and the MDT coverage which is uh low in some countries has to be improved and because some areas have uh low assessed <O/> }
{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 I mean the services are not well distributed }{\f0\fs24 <#/>Y}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 ou must make sure that these are avai
lable to all uh people and it depends on the health services you are using like in Tanzania we are using all the health services from the dispensaries to the hostels that's why we have a much wider coverage }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
In some or in the past when the leprosy specialised leprosy hostels were used this was a bit uh difficult }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
Then you have to look at social factors as uh some of our participants are going to <-/>to talk about which increase maybe uh stigma or reduce the uh uh <-/>the ability of the patients to com
e forward should be addressed also the community awareness should be increased so that people come forward for }{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 treatment }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <./>The then after the <-/>the following have to be uh ensured to occur }{
\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 so that we eliminate }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 I've mentioned political commitment then we have also to mobilise ressources }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
And this is where the co-operation of the government the non-governmental <-_organisation><+_organisations> and the donor communities like uh in this case uh in our case the German Leprosy Relief A
ssociation is important and then because the uh uh leprosy elimination strategies cannot occur in isolation we must make sure that our health services in general are better organised and consolidated so that we can maintain the current uh uh strategies we
 use in elimination in controlling leprosy }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Then the programme the activities in the programme should look at uh the information which they have }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
In the past before the MDT was introduced patients used to be treated for life }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 So the registers were showing cumulative numbers of patients }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
So we have to identify <./>whi which are really the registered patients }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 We should not count also patients who've been cured but they have disabilities }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 So we have to clean the registers 
}{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 It means remove those who do not require treatment }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
And uh this in countries like Tanzania has been achieved because all our registers now register only new patients and uh each year we count which number of patients we have }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 This will be presented by my colleague <
-_>my colleague<-/> in a few moments }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
Then after getting our information all countries who are uh looking forwards to eliminating <-_leprous><+_leprosy> should now ensure that all are being treated with MDT and we must ensure that we have enough drugs to give them }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{
\f0\fs24\lang2057 And this because they're expensive for countries like uh Tanzania and the other low income countries have again to look to the donor community and uh to make sure that you get the drug }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
Getting the drug in the country might not be a problem }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 The problem might be to distribute it to the patients those who need }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
And therefore the countries should ensure that those drugs really reach the patients }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 As the minister has mentioned in her speech that }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
our health services must ensure that those <-/>those services really reach the people }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 So when we will get the drugs in the store }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar/tense}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
we keep them and uh showing the register that we have the drugs is not enough and we have to listen when 
patients complain that they don't have drugs look at our system what mistakes we have to rectify to ensure that uh the drugs are there and this is the only thing which will motivate the donor community to continue assisting us }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{
\f0\fs24\lang2057 Now when you are treating the patients now that is the problem of detection }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 You have to ensure that your patient comes for treatment and completes the treatment }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
He can only complete the treatment if you handle them }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  properly you respect them and explain to them 
the rationale of the long treatment in these diseases and they should be able to uh <-/>to continue coming for treatment }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
And once you have achieved those to two uh number two point two and number two point three then you can aim at improving case detection }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
Because if you improve case detection without ensuring that those which you are going to detect are going to be treated you'll be wasting much of your time }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
Then knowing that leprosy is a disease which is associated with disability we must ensu
re that uh disabilities are prevented both in uh uh primary prevention and secondary prevention because most of our health personnel health care personnel are of middle and lower cadres }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
We must prepare simplify the guidelines which enable them to detect treat and prevent disabilities particularly nerve damage uh in leprosy patients }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
Then there are activities which have to be initiated which are to support these contra activities }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 The most important is training but uh as others said if you have not
 yet started training you can start the <./>el implementing while training }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 We do not to start training }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
all the workers and then start implementing }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 And then we must set therefore a system especially for uh things like uh disability care }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
You must know where the patient if he's such a problem will be referred from a dispensary level up to a consultant hospital level like Muhimbili Medical Centre }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
Because our main aim is to rehabilitate these people and to return them to their community we must at this stage initiate counselling of both the patient the family and the communities }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
And these are the activities which <./>shoul cannot be done by the people in the programme alone but when even either uh health workers the media personnel
 as uh uh the ministers there have told them in the <-/>in this gathering they should we should all aim at counselling the families to accept the patients }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
And finally to improve uh case detection it's very important that the community is aware of does not forget the signs of leprosy }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
Because as leprosy goes down people will uh health personnel will start seeing less and less patients }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 and will tend to forget how leprosy is presenting }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
<&/>grammar}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 and therefore we should continue to improve the awareness in the community }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
After we have <./>manage we have set the elimination strategy in motion we should evaluate our activities and this includes problem monitoring and evaluation which we are always doing in our control programmes looking at 
the case detection rate how they're increasing or decreasing and uh how case holding means treatment of the patient completing treatment and cure }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
Cure is uh uh progressing also disability grade if they are increasing or decreasing }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 You will see in a few moments when Doctor Mwengi presents about }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
the situation in our country }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Then we have to maintain awareness of the disease in the community }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
This uh is WHO elimination target which uh is set from nineteen ninety-three to nineteen ninety-four }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
At the moment in nineteen ninety-four we <-/>we are behind the schedule because the it was planned that it should be reduced to seventy per cent but there were still seventy-nine uh uh seventy-nine countries }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
So those countries which were planning or had planned at that time to eliminate leprosy <./>sh some of them }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
are behind schedule and they are still continuing the <-/>the activities }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 The number of cases should have progressed <O/> that year but as I told you in that uh year there were admitted two point two million cases }{
\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 So we are still uh lagging uh behind MDT coverage is also still behind but uh I hope in the next uh next five years or so we might be able to reach the proposed coverage}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <$A> <#/>That was Doctor Ipugi narrating the global leprosy situation and the WHO elimination strategy }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Over now to Doctor Mwengi who will be talking on the present situation of leprosy in Tanzania

\par <$C> <#/>Leprosy is prevalent in Tanzania with different per cent in the distribution of it
 but the most affected areas are deprived regions Alemne Idwala Mwanza Morogoro uh Ruwuma and Tanga as we might see later as the average number of cases per region and also the case detection rate by regions }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
And that's why we are so proud that the Tanzania has won against <./>lep leprosy }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
We used to have a bigger number of leprosy cases in nineteen for instance in nineteen eighty-five we had about over thirty thousand it is about thirty-six thousand cases but in nineteen ninety-three as you could see it's almost four thousand less }{
\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 cases of leprosy }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 So pleased we start with the health indicators }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
As you might see from the transparency on the wall uh we have the population of Tanzania }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 it's approximately twenty-seven million people }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
So the registered cases uh that's the prevalence the registered cases I mean in nineteen ninety-three at the end of December we had only four thousand one hundred seventy-two compared to thirty-six thousand in nineteen eighty-five }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{
\f0\fs24\lang2057 So the this is the registered cases }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 I mean the new cases and the old cases together at the end of that year we had only those cases throughout Tanzania }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
I when I say Tanzania I mean the mainland and also <-_the> Zanzibar all together }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 New cases detected that year is five thousand five hundred ninety-six }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
In normal cases we usually get uh around about three thousand cases but that year uh it has been a drop uh to a third }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 So the <-/>the prevalence of registered is towards fifteen twenty-five 
per hundred thousand which means if you collect the hundred thousand people and then you see there are new and old cases fifteen twenty-five cases or there are approximately sixteen people }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
Case detection rate was ten twenty-four as we've been told here
 that is very close to the WHO uh that means it's one point <O/> four per ten thousand So we all to have to fight these twenty-four then we declare ourselves with the uh <-/>the WHO figures The multi-drug therapy uh for us we use the <O/> with that with t
h
e combine <O/> the coverage is hundred per cent You have steady global situation it's uh it's between fifty-five to eighty-five but we have ten over to hundred per cent This was the case of Tanzania Uh post-bazillary relapses is one of the <-_indicator><+
_
indicators> that how much the <-/>the <-/>the people you treat and then they come back when the <-/>the disease has again come back So that's the relapses So post-bazillary we had only one hundred and nine multi-bazillary relapses and this was under <?/>d
u
bsom Those years we've been treating under <?/>dubsom we had ninety-one But for the new drug multiple-drug-therapy we only had forty-seven patients and the other uh group of multi-bazillary who had twenty-six So the cure rate is seventy-six for the multi-
b
azillary cases You know it takes two years to treat multi-bazillary cases and sometimes you get can get lost the sufferer can die in between but it is seventy-six it's good attainment And for post-bazillary it's almost ninety-two cases uh or even the mala
r
ia cannot treat up to that percentage It's a very high percentage So there is the our hope that we can cure leprosy uh as you can see the press people that we have ninety-two per cent who have had the leprosy can be treated and with multi uh post-bazillar
y
 would attain ninety-two per cent Okay so please give me the the other reading for the same indicators as you can see you will see those are the years over the years uh from nineteen eighty-three to ninety-one the <-/>the <-/>the long strips I mean the gr
e
en one is the <-/>the number of cases you see uh if you <-_>if you<-/> compare down to ninety-one you see the height is going down That's what explained there has been a very big fall for the registered prevalences And the red one is the uh <-/>the covera
g
e of the multiple-drug therapy in Tanzania At the end to the corner under nineteen ninety-one as you can see the <-_height><+_heights> are the same And that's what really we attain hundred per cent in that year Okay And the the line going down down and up
 
is the case detection As you can see it is slowly declining to to twenty but still uh it is our substantial hope that at the end probably leprosy will no longer be a a community problem or health problem to the community in Tanzania <?/>Heavy cases or man
y cases of leprosy you see Mtwara whereby of this number is four twenty-one comes to Morogoro Mwanza uh Ngoma}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Tanga}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <O/>}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
So in the middle you can see Arusha with only nine cases by this number Kilimanjaro very few I'm sure my friend you are happy Kilimanjaro they have no problem of leprosy there the same as in Mbeya and Lokwa}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057

than a hundred cases per year in that region where the heavy line is over four hundred cases okay The age how uh the <-/>the cases of leprosy you can see but the high peak is between It's between thirty-five y
ears to <-/>to <-/>to almost fifty fifty sixty-four years and that is very serious because that's a productive age group Specific for the age sex and <-/shortly> because of time I will just say uh males are more affected because of the exposure they go he

\par <$B> <#/>Health must act as a watchdog }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 When we talk of undernutrition environmental degradation industrial waste drugs we must relate it to health <#/>Health is a social economic political and a human phenomenon 
<#/>Now mass media is another watchdog <#/>Journalists and regular reporters must ensure that information and the right and correct information reaches the public <#/>Such information should be well presented so that it can sensitize mobilize and challeng
e
 policy makers international agencies health personnel non-governmental organizations women's groups the community and community leaders individuals in the public to take action <#/>You can name it all <O/> but it has to challenge to give information to t
a
ke action on various issues affecting the health of the two groups that is the women and the children <#/>Information must also be correct analytical and geared towards effecting things <#/>If wrong information is given then it has a negative effect <#/>T
h
is is because media people have worked very closely with organizations dealing with Aids be it governmental non-governmental or private <#/>So the media has played a big role it has educated the people to understand how Aids was caused how it is <O/> how 
it can be avoided and that's <O/> for Aids <#/>If media comes up and says that there is }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 cure for Aids it will mean that all efforts by different organizations will be wasted <#/>If media comes up and says }{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <O_>}{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>Kiswahili}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057 <O}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 /> then it will mean 
that all the exercise that we have done together be it the government the non-governmental organizations and the media it will mean that all is wasted because the people look up to the media and they listen to the media and they can change because of the 
<
-_>of the<-/> media <#/>However in order that correct information is given there is need for ministries and organizations concerned to be ready to give information <#/>This is very basic that information must be given <#/>Sometimes <-/>sometimes some of u
s
 leaders were afraid of media <#/>When you hear that there is a journalist outside your office you tell the secretary tell them I'm not here you know <#/>It is <-_>it is<-/> wrong <#/>I think you know it is very wrong that media people must have informati
o
n and must have access to information <#/>Then only <./>can they can do their work <#/>But if you don't give them information they have to write then they will write any information that they can lay their hands on <#/>Now there is a lot of information in
 
the country and outside the country and of which if we can be able to share with the media people then it can mean that this information can be well utilized <#/>As I have pointed out earlier development is measured through the position of women <#/>As jo
u
rnalists you should use your pens as grenades to portray in a right and meaningful way the status of women and children <#/>In Tanzania women and children's health is currently addressed through several policy documents and initiatives <#/>These include t
h
e National Population Policy March nineteen ninety-two the State Motherhood <O/> for Tanzania the Policy for Women and Children the Situation of Children in Tanzania the National Aids Control Programme Expanded Programme Organization and others <#/>Donor 
a
gencies for have also played a major role in women and health issues for example UNICEF UNSTA WHO and so on <#/>It is important when dealing with women's and children's health to look into all this and also to look at government contributions in terms of 
t
he budget <#/>And the standard situation in Tanzania is so but what I'm saying is that the budget of health is still low <#/>And that is why we <-/>we <-/>we have introduced other measures one of which is this cost sharing because to fill in to try to fil
l
 in it won't fill in all the gaps <#/>We'll do something but we won't be able to fill in all the gaps <#/>Therefore community involvement is very central when we talk of sustainability of programmes <#/>And uh I would like to emphasize this question of su
s
tainability as far as health is concerned <#/>Sometimes when we talk of sustainability we think in money terms you know <#/>We think that there should be you know the budget should be increased there should be more money and therefore we can have sustaina
b
le development <#/>But we don't think on the question of empowerment <#/>And this situation since we are talking of women and children we're talking of empowerment of women <#/>If women are given health education they can influence changes in the family <
#
/>For example as far as communicable diseases are concerned example to wash hands to wash your hands for example before eating the use of latrines to educate the youngsters on Aids and so on you know <#/>This is what I say <#/>I talk of sustainable in hea
l
th because it will mean that we have less disease and this is part and parcel of the prevention that we are talking about you know <#/>Women's picture must be portrayed as reproducers as producers educators home makers and also home nurses <#/>They have m
a
ny roles to play <#/>Women through the mass <-/>mass media I believe should not be seen to be retrogressive when it comes to highlighting health issues but should be bold enough you should be bold enough to report objectively on issues that have led to ba
d
 health of women and children for a long time <#/>There are many examples and here I would like to mention only a few <#/>For example what is the effect of the <-/>the problem of refugees in Rwanda on women <#/>Sometimes people do not understand us you kn
ow I was }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <+_at>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
a meeting when <./>UH <?/>UHCR <O/> organized a meeting at Kilimanjaro hotel and we said that there are certain things which are <?/>bearing to the women <#/>When you talk of refugees for example you cannot talk of refugees in totality <#/>Y
ou have to address also women refugees <#/>What are their issues in as far as health is concerned <#/>So these are important issues that I believe that the journalists can take up you know and bring up forward in front }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>idiom}{
\f0\fs24\lang2057  <#/>Effect of aids on health of women <#/>We know that apart from women being infected with Aids but we also know that it is women for example who are concerned of }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 taking care of Aids patients <#/>It is basic <#/>It is true <#/>It is women <#/>It is all the people all the w
omen who take care of the Aids patients and this is an effect also on the health of the women in this area <#/>So let we <-/>we should be able to look at the coins in these different ways <#/>The effect of Aids on women and the effect of those people who 
h
ave Aids but still it is the women who have to take care of the Aids patients <#/>What effect it has on the women's health and the children that this woman has to take care of <#/>I know that as journalists you have covered a number of health issues and I
 
would like to commend you on that you know <#/>You can read it in different papers Daily News Uhuru and others papers and it <-/>it is very good that today we have many papers in Tanzania you know and I do hope that this challenge will continue that more

 Ministry of Health is concerned you know we shall be ready and I will inform my people we shall be ready to remove all the unnecessary bureaucracies
 and there are certain documents for example you know which are transparent you know <#/>We are not saying that transparency means that everything you should have but there are certain documents actually you know you know sometimes they are made confident
i
al they are not supposed to be confidential <#/>So some of the documents I would like to say that perhaps you know they should educate the people but sometimes we censor them you know <#/>We censor them unnecessarily and when we censor them <-_unnecessary

<+_unnecessarily> it will mean that the journalists and the writers will not be able to get access to information <#/>This information which they can use actually to help the government <#/>Health is interstructural so when you need I hope when you need i

formation from other ministries because it relates to health then people will forget you know about unnecessary bureaucracy unnecessary red tape unnecessary fear also of the journalists <#/>When a journalist is outside your office we start saying I'm not 
h

<#/>For example as media people you need to use your institution to fight against harmful cultural practices such as female circumcision <#/>You should be concerned for it is the power of concerned and committed people and their organizations that can bri

o say we need to go further than that and say what has the ministry done on this what's the positive aspects and the negative aspects <#/>What has non-governmental organization has done }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 and international agencies done <#/>This is only fair <#/>A

<&/>music}{\b\f0\fs24  }{\f0\fs24 <#/>At the population growth rate of three point three per cent per annum Tanzania will have thirty-five million people by the year two thousand and the urban populations will have more than doubled thus compounding 
the housing problem <#/>This is what the Minister of State for Communications and Works <?/>Gandram <?/>Itatiro says <#/>He refers to the principal need for having serious efforts aimed at finding solutions for the pressing housing needs not only in Tanza
n
ia but generally in the whole African continent <#/>In fact <ea/>Ndugu <?/>Itatiro warns that if solutions were not found to the problem in the near future peace and stability and law and order would be at stake <#/>Tanzania for her part has been striving
 
hard since independence to provide not only enough but decent shelter for every Tanzanian but this task as many others would not be accomplished overnight because it entails a number of things to be considered and a lot of human and material resources to 
b
e expended <#/>Housing is first of all an aspect of development and for any development to be achieved there must be well weighed and adhered to strategies <#/>Then according to the government short and long term development plans and strategies the centr
e of the plans has been and is still in fact the people themselves and how they can put resources into best use <#/>Suffice it to quote President Nyerere }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <quote_> }{\f0\fs24 
<#/>Development brings freedom provided it is a development of people but people cannot be dev
eloped they can only develop themselves <#/>For while it is possible for an outsider to build a man's house an outsider cannot give the man pride and self-confidence in himself as a human being <#/>Those things a man has to create in himself by his own ac
t
ions <#/>He develops himself by what he does <#/>He develops himself by making his own decisions by increasing his understanding of what he's doing and why by increasing his own knowledge and ability and by his own full participation as an equal in the li
f
e of the community he lives in <#/>Thus for example a man is developing himself when he grows or earns enough to provide decent conditions for himself and his family <#/>He's not being developed if someone gives him these things <#/>A man is developing hi
m
self when he improves his education whatever he learns about <#/>He is not being developed if he simply carries out orders from someone better educated then himself without understanding why those orders have been given <#/>A man develops himself by joini
n
g in free discussion of a new venture and participating in the subsequent decision <#/>He's not being developed if he's herded like an animal into the new venture <#/>Development to a man can in fact only be effected by that man <#/>Development of the peo
ple can only be effected by the people }{\b\f0\fs24 <}{\b\v\f0\fs24 quote/>}{\v\f0\fs24  }{\f0\fs24 <#/>End quotes <#/>With that in mind then it's appropriate to point out that the Government of Tanzania is committed to make }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>grammar}{

 social and economic development the provision of decent shelter not excluded <#/>It should be noted that the housing problem in rural areas where the majority of Tanzanians live in traditional houses is not very acute n
or is it a serious threat to health but the government's efforts <-_is><+_are> still to help the rural population build better houses by means of better materials which can be found locally <#/>The thrust upon urban housing is to enable lower income group
s access }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\f0\fs24 
 to more decent housing and more so on self-help basis <#/>This is what the government has been doing especially since the second five-year development plan of nineteen sixty-nine up to nineteen seventy-four and thereafter in the succeed

build better and permanent houses <#/>The government will also along with parastatals and private companies consolidate plans for building hou
ses for their employees <#/>That is the long term strategy of the government towards solving the housing problem in Tanzania but our interest this week is mainly to see how Tanzanian architects contribute towards the task of housing the rural and urban po
o
r <#/>We shall consider the role of Tanzanian architects in the context of the umbrella task of African architects on solving housing problems affecting the majority of the people in the continent <#/>Perhaps the very objectives of the Architectural Assoc
i
ation of Tanzania AAT can serve as a starting point to illustrate not only the importance of architects in a given society like ours but also how such an association best tell us its objectives to suit the basic development needs of Tanzania and certainly
 Africa also <#/><?/>Mbeda <?/>Muli is the chairman of the Architectural Association of Tanzania whose main objectives include 
\par <$B> <#/>to inform the general public on the existence of the professional association through <./>pross press announcements etcetera <#/>Two to make official communications between the government and its board authorities like }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <+_article>}
{\f0\fs24  National Board of Registration of quantity surveyors <O/> quantity surveyors and building constructors and National Construction Council uh and t
o inform them of the valuable source of professional advice that is available to them through the association <#/>Thirdly to establish architectural brotherhood and relationship with other international architectural associations unions and internal relat
ed professional boards like Tanzanian Institution of Engineers and the profession centre 
\par <$A> <#/>Those are the principal objectives on which the Architectural Association of Tanzania justifies its existence but our consideration should also be on how orga
nisations like those of architects help governments in a number of areas <#/>The Prime Minister <ea/>Ndugu Salem Mohammed Salem who underlines the importance of local architects says they can contribute immensely <-_in><+_to> }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>prep}{
\f0\fs24  the formulation of th
e recovery policies of not only Tanzania but of other African governments as well mainly by ensuring that the building policies of various countries are formulated to suit concrete conditions <#/>However <ea/>Ndugu Salem emphasises that to make architects
 and what they advise the government sound more effective training must top among their priorities 
\par <$C> <#/>A training of professionals in the architectural field is a prerequisite condition to succeed in our objective towards an effective housing industry
 <#/>In many African states the number of registered architects is far below the national requirements <#/>In Tanzania for instance we have about one hundred and thirty registered architects <#/>We have to plan for the increasing demand for housing in bot
h
 urban and rural areas <#/>A few numbers of registered architects manifest the need for a consolidated training programme <#/>Tanzania has no institution which trains professionals in architecture <#/>However the Dar es Salaam art institute offers <./>sem
 semi-professional training programmes with a view to meeting the national requirements in the construction industry 
\par }\pard \qj\ri566\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {\f0\fs24 <$A> <#/>One reason which analysts <./>con concentrating on the housing situation in Tanzania and other African countries attribute to the 
not so excellent performance is that of inappropriate technology Minister <?/>Itatiro harbours the view that most African countries found themselves confronted with expensive and inappropriate architectural designs far beyond the reach of most people and 
}{\b\v\f0\fs24 <+_article>}{\f0\fs24  economy in financial terms <#/>Thus the problem of housing the poor is compounded <#/>With a need for low cost housing which utilised initiative resources and }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <+_article>}{\f0\fs24  creati
vity of the individuals and communities there is also the importance of }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <+_article>}{\f0\fs24 
 provision of appropriate designs which took into consideration the cultural heritage and aspirations <#/>Tanzania therefore needs a break-through in appropriate architectur
al design and building materials in order to make low cost housing available to the majority of the people <#/>To quote the Prime Minister <ea/>Ndugu <?/>Salem }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <quote_> }{\f0\fs24 
All over the world professionalism in architecture has mainly been urban centred <#/>In
 Tanzania and Africa in general the relevance of this system has to be reconsidered in the context of the environment where the overwhelming majority of the people live in rural areas }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <quote/>}{\v\f0\fs24  }{\f0\fs24 
\par }\pard \qj\ri141\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {\f0\fs24 <$C> <#/>These people cannot afford to pay the services of an 
architect nor can they adopt the specifications and the implied technology <#/>The government of Tanzania is taking steps by undertaking programmes to provide land for housing development giving support to institutions dealing with research development an
d
 production of local building materials and is also in the process of reviewing the colonial building by-laws <#/>All these measures are aimed redressing the above situation <#/>The architectural heritage which is not necessarily expensive should form the
 
basis of the architects' solutions to improve rural housing which not only with not only appreciable low cost but also with acceptable social orders relevant to the predominant African extended family model <#/>I therefore argue to study and understand va
r
ious cultures and technologies in our continent when designing for rural settlements <#/>As I said earlier most of our people live in the rural areas <#/>Most of them have scarce financial resources <#/>Nevertheless they need good shelter <#/>Acceptably t
h
is problem should be solved by the respective governments and architects therefore have to share the responsibility <#/>They've also the obligation to assist their governments to develop the rural areas with design solutions which will take into considera

 acute shortage of housing both quantitatively and
 qualitatively <#/>The reasons behind this are quite obvious and to mention but the two main ones are the unregulated rural urban migration and general population growth <#/>Shortage of housing in the urban areas <-_have><+_has> more often than not result

 unnecessary foreign influence in all activities of society is an important aim for Tanzania <#/>The construction policies of Tanzania stipulate in no uncertain terms that the aim shoul

 design construction and manufacture of construction materials inter alia by promoting domestic indu

a
ct that Tanzania is a poor country and there are enormous needs for development and improvement <#/>The problem for the government is to use the limited resources of the country to get maximum development impact <#/>The use of appropriate resources and ap
propriate technology for that matter in the architectural sector need not be emphasised <#/>The reasons are concisely clear 
\par <$C> <#/>As we know some of the structures we see in Africa today though they're impressive and appealing are very expensive to cons
truct and certainly also to maintain <#/>Architects engineers quantity surveyers planners and developers should therefore concentrate on cost saving designs taking into consideration <-/>consideration our environment and available building materials <#/>T
he expert of maintenance in the building industry plays a very significant role whereas maintenance of a structure is an expected reality it is a duty of architects and other involved teams of consultants to come up with }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <+_article>}{
\f0\fs24  design solution that will keep the maintenance cost to the minimum <-_>to the minimum<-/> <#/>May I also suggest that it should be their duty to draw up comprehensive maintenance schedules to enable developers }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <+_to>}{\v\f0\fs24  
}{\f0\fs24 keep realistic maintenance budgets <#/>Another aspect related t
o maintenance is linked with the necessity of involving local consultants at the earlier stages of designing where foreign consultancy is engaged <#/>Local consultants can play a positive role in helping the foreign consultants to come up with a sound des
i
gn which is both cheap and easy to maintain <#/>It would therefore be most desirable that local consultants be fully involved in all foreign consultancy projects <#/>At this stage I would like to assure the members of the <./>arch architectural community 
and the public at large that the government of Tanzania takes seriously the observations and recommendations that are forwarded by the associations through workshops seminars and conferences 
\par <X_>}{\v\f0\fs24 <$A> <#/>So according to what the Prime Minister <ea/>Ndugu Salem
 has just said the government in Tanzania in full recognition of how architects contribute immensely to the social and economic well-being of the society has always taken a keen interest in various recommendations sounded by the Architectural Association 
of Tanzania 
\par <$C> <#/>These include evaluation of education and professional qualifications review of registration procedures for individuals and farms review of method of consultant appointments evaluation of foreign firms' engagement and encouragement of 
use of local consultants materials and technology The government of Tanzania will see to it that such recommendations are fairly studied and wherever possible fully implemented

lable The President of the African Union of Architects Henry <?/>Santogo concurs that the challenge of the architect's profession is how it can contribute affectively effectively to the essentials of national developments in helping to preserve the qualit

\par <$D> <#/>The successful implementation of national development plans undoubtedly depends on many factors one of which is the essential architectural
 input to interpret and analyse effectively the requirements of research plans for the creation of the socially <./>effec uh economically and culturally acceptable environment Historically architecture has always served as a mirror that reflects the face 
i
n the form and thus the success of society for which development plans are formulated The image of such society changes as time goes on Therefore as a means of service architecture cannot escape the influence of contemporary problems facing Africa populat

\par <$A> <#/>The <-_Tanzania><+_Tanzanian> government spends a lot of efforts <-_in><+_on> }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>prep}{\v\f0\fs24  the research of housing and building materials The reason behind the research is to enable people in both rural and urban areas }{
\b\v\f0\fs24 <+_to}{\v\f0\fs24 > build low cost houses using locally available materials According to the reports by the minister responsible for housing their research was progressing well since nineteen seventy-seven }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>grammar}{
\v\f0\fs24  and by the year nineteen eighty some of the areas covered included the use o
f sisal-inforced concrete An intensive research on <?/>posolime and <?/>posolanas was also in full swing and promising results were reported and in fact specimen houses using modified local housing materials are evident in Morogoro Dar es Salaam Dodoma Ta
nga Arusha and Ruvuma regions The success of the research and its application couldn't be realised without the utmost co-operation of architects in the country but architects in Tanzania will play a much significant role }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>grammar}{
\v\f0\fs24  if they work hand in hand with their colleagues in Africa Hence the need for the architects' profession to be more consolidated and enhanced to serve the vast interests of the African continent 
\par <$D> <#/>How can architects in Tanzania in Uganda and East <./>Afri and uh other coun
tries work together uh move around so that an architect from Kenya can work in Tanzania so that instead of bringing in architects from outside we can look around within Africa to try to <-/>to work within the environments which are our own with designed b

ildings which people will feel are natural to them Now as to our organisation our union is organised on three on five regions We have divided Africa on the basis of five regions east west uh north southern and central Africa and each region is represented
 
by three people on the council one of whom is a vice-president uh East Africa is represented by Tanzania Ethiopia and Kenya and then West Africa you have Nigeria you get Senegal uh Sierra Leone and then we have in central Africa we have Cameroon Gabon and
 the Congo and then southern we have Mauritius Zambia and Lesotho And then we have other areas like the chairman of the <-_>chairman of the<-/> board of education who is from Nigeria We have the president from Uganda and then we have }{\b\v\f0\fs24

\v\f0\fs24  It\rquote s by nationally recognised <./>natio unions or instit

<&/>grammar}{\v\f0\fs24  big but in
 actual fact it's very small Out of the twenty thousand architects almost seventeen thousand <-_comes><+_come> from one country from Egypt and then we have about a thousand from Nigeria thousand from Algeria and you find that the remaining about two thous
and you can divide it }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\f0\fs24  among over thirty countries You have major countries without architects You have major countries without any rudiments of training uh <-/>training aspects
\par <$A> <#/>To solve the problems facing architects is to solve the pro
blem of poor shelter This is what Mr <?/>Santogo suggests The establishment of the union of African architects whose president is Mr <?/>Santogo was reflective of the dire need to improve human shelter in Africa in more concrete terms 
\par <$D> <#/>Uh We had T
he union started in a small way We started as as a regional Africa region <-/>region for the Commonwealth Association of uh <-/>of Architects <-_>Commonwealth Association of Architects<-/> of fifteen countries of Commonwealth <./>Afric uh Commonwealth cou

 the Africa as a whole So we thought it fit that we should expand the
 organisation to include the francophones who are not members of the Commonwealth and we set up a committee of about six countries uh uh Kenya Uganda Nigeria Ghana and Zambia and a few others who organised this meeting and we formulated a <-/>a constituti

n Then the association the union the Africa Union of Architects was inaugurated on the twenty-third May <./>nine nineteen eighty-one in uh <-/>in <-/>in Lagos Nigeria and was inaugurated by the former president of the Federal Republic of uh Nigeria Uh <na

 is to unite architects in towards the development of our own profession towards the development of our education of research technology and also of human habitation and also preserving 
our own architectural heritage We have so many buildings which are very precious assets of our nations which require to be preserved }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\f0\fs24  Then having uh had }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\v\f0\fs24 
 those priorities we looked around how }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\f0\fs24  we could properly formulate pol
icies how we could put these into effect You will know that uh architecture historically started in Africa in the pyramids in Cairo It is in the rock churches of Ethiopia but yet it is a profession within <./>archit within Africa which has developed very 
s
lowly We are very very few architects and even those few architects who are in the country we don't serve we serve a very small section of our population We serve only the bourgeois the <-/>the rich people in urban areas but then we don't serve about nine
ty per cent of the people in the rural areas So if we want some kind of education which will expand which will equip us equip the architects so that we can serve the greatest section of the people in rural areas in urban areas and also the low income }{
\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\f0\fs24 
 Shelter is a very important aspect without People with a shelter they are stable they feel secure they have a sense of belonging but a lot of our people are living in the most unhygienic uh houses How can an architect assist these <-/>these people to
 improve even the <./>hy the hygiene of the countries for them to have ventilation in a simple manner so that our people can feel that they are stable they have a sense of belonging In that way they can even improve their productive capacity 
\par <$A> <#/>That is the stark reality and in fact the challenge to Tanzanian and African architects according to the president of the Union of African Architects Mr Henry <?/>Santogo Our focus this week was directed on architects and how they can help bring 
about improved shelter for the rural and urban poor That's all from this week and join us again same time next week for yet another look at development issues and strategies in Tanzania }{\f0\fs24 </X><I/>

\par <$A> <#/>Hello and a please welcome to another programme of book review <#/>This week we are reviewing a book titled Gender and Development in Tanzania Pas
t Present and Future <#/>The book is compiled by Anna <?/>Nilea <?/>Inkia and Teresia <?/>Mruma <#/>It is published by the Women Research and Documentation Project Dar es Salaam and it's reviewed for us as usual by Edwin Semsaba
\par <$B> <#/>This book is a collection of articles that deals with different aspects of life as related to gender in Tanzania <#/>The authors also give their recommendations as }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <+_to>}{\v\f0\fs24  }{\f0\fs24 
what should be done to arrest the situation <#/>There is a consensus among the writers that a gender im
balance exists and this has not been caused by biological traits but by men in various modes of production that the world has gone through <#/>It is the women who are the victims of this imbalance <#/>The articles are concerned though not all in a uniform
 
manner with the reasons for the immemorial oppression of women in <-_the> class and pre-class societies alike <#/>The consequences of legislative affairs for the struggle for development in Tanzania and for what ends in the name of what values and ideals 
could society be inspired to fight against this <O/> inequality today <#/>B Koda and Anga Isa in their paper Gender and Relation Concepts state that there are diverse categories occupying the world and do exist }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\f0\fs24 
 in relationships which are sometimes not only contradictory but antagonistic <#/>Such relationships within social formations in which people live and of the production relations therein for example the political and economic }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
arrangements}{\f0\fs24  specifying who controls which resources and appropri
ates whose labour output <#/>It has already been established that the division of people is based on property ownership and is best identified on the basis of class race gender and age <#/>They argue that it has already been established that the respectiv
e
 social imbalances are embedded in given ideologies such as patriarchy capitalism matriarchy apartheid colonialism and even socialism and religion <#/>They state that gender is the first category of operation and will probably be the last category of libe
r
ation <#/>Their assertion is based on the historical nature of all oppressive categories by institutions social systems and communities that include global capitalism all of which have relied on the support of women at different levels including the house
h
old <#/>In that case and as long as the exploitation of labour by capital continues and male dependency on female roles persists including the burden of biological and social <-_reproductions><+_reproduction> gender will be the last category of liberation
 <#/>They end their article discussing paradigms that do inform }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\f0\fs24 
 on gender relations <#/>The second part deals with research methods with application to gender in which <name/> deals with data collection analysis and interpretation <#/>Part Three
 deals with the social aspects of gender whereby four people have contributed <#/><Name/> in her article Gender Bias in Language shows that there is gender bias in language <#/>She sees the implications of these women as serious and far-reaching <#/>The i
n
culcation of stereotyped images of women through language and other social institutions begins with childhood and continues until death <#/>This has facilitated the absorption of thoughts and beliefs hostile to women to the extent that these are taken as 
t
ruth by men and women <#/>Women themselves constantly use these images to describe other women and themselves <#/>This has greatly eroded <-_in><+_the> self-esteem and confidence of women in general <#/>A woman who is constantly interrupted in speech may 
f
inally believe that she has nothing to offer and consequently becomes silenced <#/>A woman who is constantly reminded that she is a sexual object created for the pleasure of men may decide that the best way to succeed is to serve men's needs and interests
 
<#/>She may therefore strive to behave in a manner acceptable to men <#/>Language thus serves as a powerful tool in both creating and maintaining the power relations present in society <#/>The author <-_say><+_says> changing language alone to make it more
 
positive towards women may be a difficult task if other areas of inequality remain intact but it is her belief that more gender eqality in social and economic spheres will result in a language that is less hostile to women and create an environment more s
u
itable for equality and change <#/><Name/> Omari Gendered Perceptions The Way We Learn About Them analyses some of the customs and traditions to see how they are being used in the socialisation process to impart and mould certain behaviours and the way of
 
doing things in our society <#/>Omari observes that the way human beings learn things and then internalise them to develop some gender relations which become part of our lives leads to gender inequality in our society <#/>Among the inequalities he names t
he bias seen in resource allocation based on sex <#/>Women are denied to inherit }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\f0\fs24 
 properties at household level <#/>In most African societies women do not inherit land <#/>It is conceded that because women are going to be married hence transferre
d to another social unit it is not proper for them to take with them the land which is considered a family property irrespective of their very significant contribution to agriculture production <#/>Richard Mbala in his article Gender in Tanzania Fiction r
eveals that there is gender bias by writers but not done }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\f0\fs24  intentionally <#/>Mbala sees that research in this field it }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\f0\fs24  is still minimal and recommends more research to be done }{

es music as very expressive in showing gender relations while <?/>Louis <?/>Buguni has outlined notes on the creative process in gender formative prejudices concepts and perceptions <#/>Part Four of the book deals with the economic and political aspects o
f
 gender in which Berta <?/Koda argues that there is limited women involvement in politics either as elected or appointed leaders <#/>In her article Women Participation in Politics and Public Life in Tanzania she sees the strategy adopted by women of optin
g }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\f0\fs24 
 work for political change out of the formal male dominated system is not to be taken as alternative but rather as a complementary system <#/>She suggests that women's decision making power and control at all levels is essential in the fight for
 gender equality <#/>Women are advised by Rose Shyo in her article Gender and Economics Analysing the Changing Roles of Women Participation in Economic Development to abandon the piecemeal economic project approach which they found themselves in and adopt
 
a long term co-ordinated perspective to planning <#/>She recommends that in this time of <ea/><?/>madiosi women should use the power of their words to bargain for more resources equal opportunities credit facilities and all other necessary <O/> measures n
o
w lacking <#/>Part Five of the book deals with legal aspects of gender and <name/> in Physical Violence Against Women and the Law in Mainland Tanzania suggests that both legal and extra-legal interventions should operate side by side <#/>This is to make e
ffective the bill of rights in the constitution which <-_lack><+_lacks> clear government policy for law reforms <#/><Name/> in his article Political Rights of Women in Tanzania at Catch}{\b\f0\fs24  }{\f0\fs24 
Twenty-Two says the challenge facing everyone engaged in the end
eavour to procure equal rights for and the exercise thereof by women is to concede and declare publicly the factors likely to limit the success of that endeavour <#/>A D <?/>Kwara in Gender Context in Tanzania's Health Policy addresses itself to the issue
s of gender in Tanzania's health system <#/>It deals also with <-_the> cost sharing in the context of structural adjustment and its impact on women's health <#/>It explores women's situation in society and its implications in the formulation of }{
\b\v\f0\fs24 <+_article>}{\f0\fs24  
gender sensitive health policy <#/>Among the recommendations <?/>Kwara puts forward is that if women are to be given their rightful position in the health policy of the country they must mobilise themselves for it <#/>Anna <?/>Nilea <?/>Inkia in her artic
le The Mass Media Gender and Development in Tanzania says the mass media plays little }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\f0\fs24 
 role in correcting the awareness concept the female gender is inferior <#/>She recommends that the editors and writers of fiction stories designers of advertis

o Part Eight that deals with agricultural and technological aspects of gender <#/>Part Nine deals with gender aspects of HIV AIDS where Justin Guma discusses the essential decision making in the context of AIDS and sees the need for women in parliament <#
/>Ellen Boma sees HIV AIDS as an economic and social challenge to women in Tanzania <#/>Boma observes that the effect of HIV infection and AIDS on women are }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\f0\fs24 
 more than medical issues <#/>They include the fact that women are placed at higher risk 
of contracting the disease through their social and reproductive roles gender inequality and <-_none><+_no> empowerment to make decisions on their own sexuality and health <#/>AIDS stigmatization is generally higher for women than it is for men <#/>For ex
a
mple it is generally assumed that a man who dies from HIV AIDS is not ashamed because he died while on duty <ea><O/> <#/>There are no similar statements directed to women <#/>In spite of having a higher risk of contracting AIDS most women have limited acc
e
ss to health information that could help them make right decisions about their health <#/>A future without gender barriers could not efface the struggle and surely the publication of this book Gender and Development in Tanzania past Present and Future is 
p
art of Women Research and Documentation Projects' effort to shift the terrain of struggle negotiation and often compromise from the private realm to the public sphere <#/>In this sense the book is addressed in some embarrassment to women as much as to men

 <#/>Kenya and Uganda have had a <-/>a <-/>a taste of multi-party elections <#/>Tanzania is in the process of

\par <$B> <#/>Zambia formerly the British colonial territory of Northern Rhodesia gained its independence on the twenty-fourth of October nineteen sixty-four <#/>It has a popul
ation of six point eight million occupying an elevated plateau country in south-central Africa <#/>It has an area of seven hundred and fifty-two thousand six hundred and fourteen square kilometres <#/>Zambia is a land-locked state and shares a boundary wi
t
h no fewer than eight other countries <#/>It is surrounded by Angola Zaire Tanzania Malawi Mozambique Zimbabwe Botswana and Namibia <#/>Seventy per cent of its population lives in the rural areas <#/>Zambia has more than seventy tribes the major ones bein
g Bemba Nyanja Tonga Lozi Lunda and Livale <#/>The capital of the country is Lusaka
\par <$A> <#/>The landscape of Zambia is dominated by the even skylines of uplifted plantation surfaces <#/>About four fifths of the country is covered by Savannah woodland of se
mi-evergreen trees <#/>Highest elevations are reached on the Nika Plateau on the Malawi border with a height of two thousand one hundred and sixty-four metres where uplift associated with the East-African Rift system is at maximum <#/>Elevation declines w
e
stward where the country extends into the vast Kalahari Basin <#/>This <-_lie><+_lies> in an ancient arm of the East-African rift system but the rifting which formed Lake Tanganyika and Lake Mweru through on the country's northern border is of more recent
 age
\par <$B> <#/>The recent history of Zambia shows that it came into existence on the twenty-fourth of October nineteen sixty-four when independence was granted by the British was granted to the British Protectorate of Northern Rhodesia <#/>This had been admi
nistered by the Colonial Office since nineteen twenty-four <#/>Before that the territory had been administered for a quarter of a century by the British South Africa Company <#/>The main impetus of British intrusion north of the Zambesi came from Cecil Rh
o
des a South African millionaire <#/>Rhodes wanted to see the High Plateau of Central and Eastern Africa under British rule settlement <#/>He also wanted to earn next to his personal mining empire the copper deposits of Katanga and gold deposits between Li
m
popo and Zambesi <#/>The British government concerned as it was with maintaining British supremacy at the Cape was anxious to prevent the Boers Portuguese or Germans from creating hostile alliances further north <#/>Thus in eighteen eighty-nine it granted
 
a charter to Rhodes' newly formed British South Africa Company giving it powers to make treaties and conduct administration north of the Limpopo <#/>In eighteen eighty-nine the British South Africa Company occupied the eastern part of what became Southern
 
Rhodesia south of the Zambesi and meanwhile it had obtained treaties and concessions from various African chiefs north of the Zambesi <#/>Rhodes' agents were unsuccessful in Katanga which fell instead to King Leopold the Second of Belgium but the agreemen
ts elsewhere saved most of what became Northern Rhodesia now known as Zambia <#/>The first president on achieving independence was Dr Kenneth Kaunda leader of the UNIP party
\par <$A> <#/>For the first six years after independence in October nineteen sixty-four 
the Zambian economy was one of the richest and fastest growing of Sub-Saharan Africa <#/>Gross domestic product in nineteen sixty-five prices increased by an estimated thirteen per cent per annum from nineteen sixty-four to nineteen sixty-nine the result 
o
f annual expansion in real output of five point five per cent to six per cent and an improvement in the terms of trade due to higher copper prices of seven per cent annually for the next five years <#/>From nineteen seventy the picture was more mixed with
 
wide fluctuations in national income at constant prices which rose moderately until mid nineteen seventies and than fell more sharply <#/>By nineteen eighty-two the capital output gross domestic product was estimated at about US dollars six hundred in rea
l
 terms some twenty-three per cent below the level of ten years earlier <#/>From nineteen seventy-four to nineteen eighty real gross domestic product was halved <#/>From nineteen seventy-five to nineteen eighty estimated private consumption per head declin
e
d in real terms by one third expenditure on government services per head by nearly one quarter and the government capital government expenditure per head by nearly two thirds <#/>The result by nineteen eighty was an economy in disarray with severe shortag
e of foreign exchange periodic shortages of basic goods including foodstuffs
\par <$B> <#/>The decline of the economy of Zambia was a result of <./>res recession on the price and demand of copper in the world Zambia has had only limited success in expanding a pr
ogramme on agriculture and industrial output in order to diversify the economy <#/>In nineteen seventy-five the president of Zambia called for a major change of strategy including a programme of rural reconstruction <#/>As a result the rural sector's perf
o
rmance in nineteen seventy-six and nineteen seventy-seven was relatively <./>co good with the production of maize which is Zambia's staple food reaching record levels <#/>Also in the harvest of nineteen eighty nineteen eighty-one there was a bumper season
 for maize and other crops such as millet and sorghum

 sharp upward trend <#/>If higher prices were maintained and if Zambia wa
s able to <-/re-shed> its foreign debts the country would have been able to start pulling out of its dire financial crisis by nineteen eighty-three provided that the government's austerity measures introduced at the of start nineteen eighty-three were con
tinued
\par <$B> <#/>Metal mining is the country's most important economic activity providing about ninety-five per cent of foreign exchange earnings and sixteen per cent to eighteen per cent of gross domestic product <#/>Owing to the continuing predominance of 
the copper industry and }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <+_article>}{\f0\fs24  grossly inadequate level of rural development the Zambian economy has an extremely dualistic structure characterised by }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <+_article>}{\f0\fs24 
 large disparity of income and living standards between mining and other workers between high level personnel including expatriates and most other Zambians and between persons on the line of rail }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>idiom}{\f0\fs24 
 and those scattered in other parts of the country <#/>Agriculture accounted for only about eleven per cent of the gross domestic product in nineteen eighty-two of which }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <+_article>}{\f0\fs24 
 subsistence output contributed about two thirds and the commercial sector about one third of which about one half came from European-owned farms <#/>The share of manufacturing output has greatly increased from unde
r six per cent in nineteen sixty-four to eleven per cent of }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <+_article>}{\f0\fs24  gross domestic product in nineteen eighty-two
\par <$A> <#/>Zambian agriculture is split into three sectors <#/>Production by a few hundred large commercial farmers mainly expatriates who i
n <-/>in nineteen seventy-nine produced about half of the total marketed agricultural output a growing number of small scale Zambian farmers and a mass of traditional farmers who are scattered throughout the country producing at low levels of productivity
 
and selling little to the market <#/>Crops grown in Zambia are maize wheat and tobacco <#/>Other crops are cotton soya beans sunflower sugarcane and rice <#/>They also keep cattle <#/>They import food to supplement local production but there is a large-sc
a
le production of wheat and expansion of sugarcane plantations <#/>The chief cash crops are maize groundnuts and tobacco <#/>Zambia's economy is totally <-_dependable><+_dependent> on the mineral sector as it contributes ninety per cent of its foreign exch
ange earnings
\par <$B> <#/>Zambia gained independence in October nineteen sixty-five from the United Kingdom <#/>Later it became a republic and a party state with Dr Kenneth Kaunda as its first president <#/>Despite his long defence of the one party system in t
he end he agreed to political <./>plural pluralism <#/>Mr Frederick Chiluba took over from Dr Kenneth Kaunda who was one of the most influential leaders in this continent of Africa 
\par <$A> <#/>President Frederick Chiluba was born in Kitwe on the thirtieth of
 April nineteen forty-three <#/>He completed his upper primary school in nineteen fifty-eight at Johnson Falls in Luapula province before entering junior secondary school at <name/> in the same province <#/>He started }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <+_article>}{\f0\fs24

Witchcraft according to Dr <?/>Mesack is the socially constructed reality which baffles many states ruining lives in Africa }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 It is known to be a critical factor in state societal 
<O/> in many African countries with consequential antagonisms between the individuals groups and law }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 It presents paradoxes and dilemmas }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
It has been established that witchcraft blocks progress }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 Law which believes in practices may in turn be generated by certain types of development }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
Bearing in mind the widespread nature of witchcraft in Tanzania Dr <?/>Mesack in his paper proposed to look at witch killings specifically in the Sukoma area where murder of old women are taking place }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{
\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 But why women
\par <$B> <#/>It has been customary to generalize that victims of the witch killings are mostly the stereotypical and eye red-eyed old women <#/>From my researches I have come to realize that it is not easy to provide any single circumspect expl
anation of this attitude <#/>It is not only because of the age of women which is said to be as old as <O_>}{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 two or three words}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
<O/> and has been very prevalent in many different kinds of social systems including as I have pointed out medieval Europe <#/>In the Sukoma however there are no high level vested interests involved as was the case in Europe in }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
<+_article>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  witch craze <#/>That is witch killings are not sanctioned by the powers that be <#/>It's a local phenomenon <#/>Sukoma witches as elsewhere have cer
tain attributes <#/>They are said typical to be old eccentric and given to unsocial <-_behaviours><+_behaviour> scolding cursing irritability and the like <#/>They are thought to be especially charactered }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{
\f0\fs24\lang2057  by their red eyes 
\par <$A> <#/>One point pe
rhaps worth mentioning is the fact that many Sukoma women have red eyes because of continuous use of cow dung as fuel of cooking and it is conceivable that this may contribute if only imaginary to their particular victimization in this context 
\par <$B> <#/>It
 should be borne in mind that not all women victims are red-eyed <#/>There are cases of women being killed on account of their success in business in life in general witchcraft being used only as a camouflage to conceal the real reasons <#/>A more powerfu
l
 effect in the Sukoma case may be the structural imbalance between men and women in the social system with accusations being some sort of expression of the subordinated status of women <#/>Sukoma's socialisation stresses the fact that women are inherently
 
prone to witchcraft and this has been authenticated by other researchers as well and also by <#/>I mean I have recent tests from one of my researchers who just come from the field <#/>If need be I can read that out <#/>In fact my idea might be to suggest 
t
hat all Sukoma women are likely to be the most susceptible targets weak and <O/> as they are for those who look for human scapegoats to explain the <-_shortenings><+_shortcomings> of society <#/>This was prominently established with the rise of the <name/
>
 groups known in Sukoma and <name/> areas by the name of <name/> <#/>This movement sought to eliminate some forms of insecurity and injustice consequently brought havoc for older women who saw the movement as a resurgence of traditional male aggression an
d
 oppression <#/><Name/> members being Sukoma themselves hated old women who are vulnerable to perceptions of ill omen Sukoma I mean in Sukoma communities <#/>However it is very difficult without detailed case material to confirm the mere assertion of the 
above theories 
\par <$A> <#/>However Dr <?/>Mesack states some of the reasons that has made him to establish }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  the witch killings in Sukoma land 
\par <$B> <#/>I have established that witch killings in Sukoma epitomise the cultural clash between idealised 
modernisation goals of the state and cosmology of the Sukoma people and the <name/> people and in Sukoma the political and economic change including the abolition of traditional rule <#/>Villagization and the development of commodity production has unleas
hed }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 the number of contending forces <#/>Crime homicides and especially killing of suspected witches can thus be viewed as an expression of this contest in an area where old cultural forms are still powerful <#/>The witch killings in Sukoma pose 
a threat to peace and security of course which are indispensable for }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 social and economic development of our country <#/>I relate to the particular significance of the preponderance of women as victims in this phenomena <#/>This <./>mis misogyny
 is unacceptable in the nineteen nineties and above all an anathema to the ideology of <ea/>ujamaa in Tanzania and the peace and tranquillity we have been enjoying all this long <#/>At the root of this dilemma of course is a question of belief <#/>It is i
llusory to think that beliefs and norms of people can be transformed while the basic social situation within which they act and react they remain unchanged }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 <#/>As such it can be hypothesised that witchcraft will continue to be a threat because the fact that witchcraft is flourishing remain }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  <#/>The state authorities }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <+_have}{
\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 > }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 shown evidence of the ability to control these factors }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>sense}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$A> <#/>After Dr <?/>Mesack\rquote s presentation the participants had a chance to present their views <#/>Professor Daudens Impangala <name/> Director University of Dar es Salaam emphasized the need to make more researches }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 
<&/>lexeme}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  on witchcraft because people say their beliefs are primitive they don\rquote t exist and so talking about them or doing research on them is wasting time 
\par <$C> <#/>So this attitude has developed in our society to the extent that it has also <-_influence><+_influenced> state organs <#/>The law is not very clear on this issue you see uh <#/>Actually I helped to realize a revival of <-/>of
 a big revival of interest on the research of witchcraft in Europe <#/>I was surprised <#/>There is a lot of research which has been done on Nigeria and Cameroon particularly West Africa and in fact in Nigeria and Cameroon uh the law is very clear on issu
es of witchcraft and how to deal with witchcraft but in our case here it is something which has to be secret <#/>It is to be secret because for this church to show that it is it believes that these beliefs or witchcraft activities are there }{
\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
<#/>No it is uh something bad <#/>So what I would like to say is that I think it is time because something which exists <#/>It's a belief which exists and which affects people such as such <-/>such big numbers of killings <#/>You can\rquote 
t just brush it away as something primitive <#/>It doesn\rquote 
t need our attention <#/>I think the initiative of Dr <?/>Mesack to do research on witchcraft should be widened so that we address this issue also from the academic and intellectual point of view 
\par <$A> <#/>Avemaria <name/> agrees with the reasons Dr <?/>Mesack gave on the paper on why women are murdered but she still had other points to add 
\par <$D> <#/>But I think there <-/>there is something which is missing because}{\b\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  few days ago we heard over the media that one 
woman was caught uh somewhere in <?/>okonga or whatever naked very early in the morning <#/>I don\rquote t know they said that she was doing some witches }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  around the house of somebody and again}{
\b\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\f0\fs24\lang2057  few months ago we heard that a woman in <-/>in 
Dodoma I think was again arrested because she had limbs of a human being <#/>That one again was through the media but when she was asked she said that the woman went for abortion and unfortunately she died so she was trying to <-/>to you know to conceal t
hat body but you know despite the fact that there are some cases of victimization but there are doubts <-/>doubts sometimes as to the you know to this accusation because like the case in uh <-/>in <?/>okonga I don\rquote 
t know maybe we need now to take action and see how that woman was blamed for or for just bewitching somebody\rquote 
s house <#/>And uh secondly in Sukoma what I came to discover again maybe it will be just an addition because when I was doing the research on environment we were faced again with the same 
problem but the explanation which we are given is that that system of uh you know young couples to stay with their parents-in-laws the family of their husband contributes a lot to this uh accusation when the mother-in-law now gets old because most of the 
mothers-in-laws treat badly their daughters-in-laws }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar/plurals}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
when they come to their houses <#/>They overwork them <#/>They accuse them <#/>They do whatever they wish to them so when they are liberated now they go and start their own household so
mewhere and then the mother-in-law gets old and uh she <-/>she has to go and stay with that uh family again <#/>That daughter-in-law in most cases is not happy to see that the very mother-in-law who was uh uh victimizing her now comes and stays there with
 their <-_>with their<-/> <-_>with their<-/> families and usually they just go and whisper to the <ea/>zunguzungus and the <ea/>zunguzungu will come and act <#/>They give an ultimatum if she doesn\rquote t move they just kill her 
\par <$A> <#/>Then Dr <?/>Mesack clarified on <name/> naked cases <#/>He said it is difficult to say on that because the law is not clear 
\par <$B> <#/>Our witchcraft treatise is very <#/>It\rquote s very ambiguous <#/>It's not <./>exp explicit as if you go and read the Ugandan witchcraft act of nineteen
 seventy-six which just states categorically that witchcraft does not include bona fide <ea/><O/> <O/> and stuff whereas in our case uh it\rquote 
s very ambiguous <#/>In fact it talks about sorcery and enchantment even in the case of you know limbs being found you know with this other person <#/>So it need a lots of reforming and also to be explicit <#/>It\rquote 
s not easy to <-/>to prove a witchcraft case and that\rquote s why for example that out you pointed out the case that most of these Sukoma and <name/> women would be l
iving with their grandchildren and they are living with them so that they can help you know in case of need and trouble and if for example they come the killers come and kill this old woman the evidence of the child who was in the house is not taken as ev
idence in law <#/>It\rquote s not <-_>it\rquote s not<-/> allowed in law because he is an under-age person who cannot satisfy <#/>Therefore again }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>laughs}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057

from Shinyanga and Mwanza regions <#/>One of them was Helen <name/> <#/>She expresses her feelings concerning the murder of old women 
\par <$E> <#/>I'd been uh <#/>A relative of mine who was killed as a witch and actually she's <-/>she's a younger sister to my grandmother so in Sukoma I just call her grandmother and so this woman was killed and actually I am also a medical uh person and I
\rquote m quite interested because it really frustrates me and I\rquote 
m glad that in his paper Dr <?/>Mesack mentioned the possibility of a correlation or linkage between what is happening and the epidemics like measles cholera and dysentery because just a few days ago I was talking to ano
ther old woman from my village <#/>She had come visiting and I was asking her about the status at home <#/>She was saying that people are dying a lot of children because of bloody diarrhoea but we are just waiting our time to be killed because whenever a 
c
hild dies there must be found a witch but actually this old woman is so brave she knows even some linkage <#/>So I was thinking maybe in our future plans we could see whether the increase in killings uh witch killings is somehow correlated to disease epid
e
mics to just to confirm probably some of the hunches we already have so that even if we are strategising then we know actually even how to teach people to educate people in this particular aspect because I actually I have a hunch that there is an increase
 in witch killings during a disease epidemic especially dysentery and measles so and Dr <?/>Mesack touched on this particular issue here and I also wanted to point out on }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 the villagization <#/>Actually it is really a frustration to the Sukoma community to have been moved and live }{\b\v\f0\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\f0\fs24\lang2057 
 in those villages because actually the population increased and there are lots of mixing and losing uh of the values which they had}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057  }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <X_>}{\v\f0\fs24\lang2057

 and also the <ea/>ntemi He mentioned the <ea/>ntemi My father was an <ea/>ntemi so and when I was growing up as my father being <ea/>ntemi I thought that my <-/>my village area was so peaceful I think in my own perception bu
t when I look at the Sukoma land particularly where I come from is <name/> it is I mean everybody is in turmoil People don\rquote t even sometimes want to go home because they don\rquote 
t know whether witchcraft is really a reality or a myth and probably we don\rquote t know 
whether it is a reality or a myth So the <-/>the changes in cultural practices have affected that because the <?/>intemi played a great role For <-/>For example my <-/>my father is so human a mediator and a person who used to bring people together to live
 
peacefully and to harmonize whatever was happening but after that with the new system and the new ways of living people just got sort of confused and I think there is a need to try and look into this issue more seriously and I am particularly very interes

admission of Mozambique into the club which increased its membership to fifty-three <#/>Mozambique unlike the rest of the club members is lusophone that is a former Portuguese colony <#/>It is non-anglophone <#/>The New Zealand summit came up with a numbe

 of resolutions on the international situation as well as problems with the club in particular the slow pace of democratisation processes in three West African countries Nigeria Sierra Leone and the Gambia <#/>In Nigeria the military authorities have been
 
reluctant to hand over power to a civilian government which they had promised to do in nineteen ninety-three <#/>The Commonwealth leaders were also irked by the Nigeria's decision to execute nine human rights' activists of the minority Ogoni tribe <#/>The
 
executions took place while the Oakland summit was under way <#/>In addition to suspending Nigeria's membership of the club the Commonwealth leaders also gave the authorities in Abuja two years until the next Commonwealth summit due to be held in Britain

\par <I> <#/>The first international conference on the elimination of leprosy held in Vietnam this month has ended with the adoption of the Hanoi declaration on the elimination of the disease }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
The declaration adopted unanimously by conference delegates from twenty-eight countries where leprosy is still endemic calls for stronger and decisive commitment of all interested parties towards fighting the dreadful disease }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{
\f0\fs24 The declaration stressed that the multi-drug therapy a combination of anti leprosy drugs as recommended by World Health Organisation represents an unparalleled opportunity to master the scourge of humanity which is thousands of years old }{
\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 We warmly welcome the Hanoi accord and hope that the WHO and the international community at large will attain the desired call of eradicating leprosy by the year two thousand }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
For centuries leprosy control consisted mainly of isolating patients and genuine treatment of the disease started in the nineteen fifties with the introduction of a drug called Dapsun }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
Within twenty-five years however the disease had become resistant to the drug rendering treatment increasingly ineffective }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
In nineteen eighty-one the multi-drug therapy was introduced on the recommendation of a WHO study group }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 The multi-drug therapy is a combination of three drugs for severe cases and two drugs
 for milder cases and since its introduction leprosy has been greatly reduced }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 During the first ten years since its introduction the disease was reduced by more than sixty per cent }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
To date the multi-drug therapy has succeeded in reducing the number of leprosy cases world-wide by some seventy per cent }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
The WHO says however that leprosy is considered to have been eliminated as a public health problem when its prevalence rate falls below one per ten thousand population }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 The organisation says the e
limination of the disease as a public health problem does not mean total eradication and that small numbers of cases will continue to occur beyond the year two thousand due to the long incubation period of the disease }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
It says leprosy cannot be eliminated unless the multi-drug therapy coverage is increased to a level exceeding eighty-five per cent and kept there for four to five years }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
If as the WHO puts it elimination does not mean total eradication cases of the disease could be detected even after the target of the year two thousand }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
Moreover there are only five and a half years left before the target date is reached }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 Now that the Vietnam conference has come up with a blueprint for eradicating leprosy we feel all the countries where the disease
 is endemic should devise ways of confronting the problem }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
Three years ago the WHO established a working group on leprosy control to advise on various issues such as increasing the participation of leprosy-endemic countries in disease control efforts an
d increasing support and co-ordination between various leprosy agencies }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
It is estimated that six to seven million cases will need to be diagnosed and <-_cures><+_cured> in the next six years to meet the elimination target }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 Leprosy affects countries mainly in the developing world }{
\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 South-east Asia region is the worst affected followed by Africa and Latin America }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 If at all efforts to eliminate the disease are to succeed countries with lepro
sy cases should start at the national level before moving to the international level }{\f0\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 For this reason therefore leprosy must be given high priority in a world that faces many problems <I/>
