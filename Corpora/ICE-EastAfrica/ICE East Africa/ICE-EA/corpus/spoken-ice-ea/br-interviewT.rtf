\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <I> <$C> <#/>Face the Mike <#/>This is a weekly question and answer ses
sion on national and international issues <#/>Cotton is the world's leading textile fibre <-_counting><+_accounting> for about fifty per cent of the global textile market <#/>The annual consumption of cotton as a textile raw material is about sixty millio
n
 bales the equivalent of fourteen million tons <#/>Tanzania is among the seventy-five countries which produce cotton in the world <#/>The large majority of world cotton producers are developing countries who have of late become consumers of their own raw 
c
otton due to their rapidly expanding textile industries <#/>Yet as is the case with Tanzania cotton is one of the highly placed foreign exchange earners for developing countries <#/>Also according to official statistics cotton consumption in producer coun
tries has more than tripled from two million tons between nineteen fifty and nineteen fifty-one to six million tons in the year nineteen seventy-four seventy-five <#/>Therefore most of }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057 
 textile industries of the developing world have home grown cotton available as raw material in abundant supply and at low cost <#/>However developing countries like Tanzania are facing a number of problems in their efforts to meet }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 
<+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  local and export needs of cotton <#/>The cotton industry in Tanzania has 
for many years been affected by such problems as failure to gin the crop and transportation but according to the general manager of the <-_Tanzania><+_Tanzanian> Cotton Authority <ea/>Ndugu Magnus Mdope a lot of effort is being made to improve ginneries a
nd to eliminate other bottlenecks <#/>This is undoubtedly only part of the responsibilities of the Tanzania Cotton Authority which are elaborated further by <ea/>Ndugu Mdope in this week's Face the Mike interview with Radio Tanzania's <name/> Mahmood

\par <$B> <
#/><-_Tanzania><+_Tanzanian> Cotton Authority was established way back in nineteen seventy-three as a corporate authority charged with the responsibility of promoting cotton production in this country <#/>Actually its history emanates from the former <O/>
 
marketing board which was charged with the responsibility of uh marketing cotton both internally and externally and in nineteen seventy-two with the decentralisation of the government machinery it was decided to form by this group authorities and as for c
otton TCA was formed
\par <$A> <#/>uh Let's now uh come back to uh this week you call Cotton Week <#/>What is the significance of the week
\par <$B> <#/>Well the significance of this uh cotton week is uh that uh this year for the first time we'll be having an interna
tional conference on cotton uh in Arusha uh both the International Cotton Advisory Committee and the International Institute for Cotton will be having their plenary sessions in Tanzania and we thought uh it <-_could><+_would> be a good idea if we if the p
ublic had some idea of <-/>of what <-/>what these institutions uh are all about
\par <$A> <#/>uh Are there any other activities you're going to show in this week or you'll be }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  only informing the public about the two international conferences in Arusha
\par <$B> <#/>Well we'll be talking mainly about those two uh international bodies and uh as usual the members of the public would like to know what's going on and we thought it <-_could><+_would> be a good idea if we could have uh a session whereby we could t
alk a little bit about cotton in Tanzania and internationally
\par <$A> <#/>What efforts are you putting }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057  to encourage cotton growers in the country 
\par <$B> <#/>Well that is a question which is being handled both by TCA in consultation with the governme
nt and as you know over the last couple of years production in Tanzania of cotton has stagnated around uh three hundred thousand bales whereas if you remember early in the sixties our production had gone up to almost half a million bales and what we've be
en trying to do is uh put emphasis on uh extension services by making sure that the farmers adhere to recommended practices of <-/>of }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057 
 proper growing of cotton and uh other incentives which have been taken uh have been uh by way of }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  increase in producer prices and increased efficiency in the processing and handling of the crop as a whole 

\par <$A> <#/>uh What is the main reason <-_of><+_for> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  the decrease of production 
\par <$B> <#/>Well one of the main reasons for the decrease in cotton production has been that uh you see most of this cotton in Tanzania is grown in the lake zone and uh there we have the problem of uh drought over a couple of years }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 
<&/>grammar/}{\b\fs24\lang2057 tense}{\fs24\lang2057  and uh this has had an adverse effect on the production of food crops <#
/>Now cotton being an annual crop normally when the time comes for planting farmers tend to uh pay more attention to food crops than }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_to>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 
cotton and hence the decline in cotton production <#/>One other reason for this decline has been poor husbandry practices by the farmers
\par <$A> <#/><-/>Mmh and crop authorities in the country uh have been engaged in }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  marketing of the crop instead of uh establishing their own estates or farms uh how do you foresee this problem 
\par <$B> <#/>Well it could be that question could be true in respect to several other authorities but as far as uh }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  cotton authority is concerned uh in fact since nineteen seventy-four we started }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\b\fs24\lang2057 /tense}{\fs24\lang2057  opening our own estates and as of today we have about uh fifteen esta
tes scattered all over the country mainly in the eastern cotton growing areas in Morogoro uh Kilosa and Tanga region Kilimanjaro and Arusha and also in the western cotton growing areas we have some farms in Singida Shinyanga <name/> and Mwanza region and 
Kagera <#/>So I wouldn't agree with your question that we haven't been uh addressing ourselves to that kind of problem 
\par <$A> <#/>That's very good and uh now <ea/>Ndugu Mdope sometimes }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  textile industry in the country complains of }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  shor
tage of raw materials while cotton is piled up in the regions' go-downs <#/>What is TCA doing to alleviate this situation 
\par <$B> <#/>Well that problem has occurred mainly I\rquote d say this year <#/>It's <-/>it\rquote s a very recent <-_phenomena><+_phenomenon> in the s
ense that in the past we used to have stocks to carry us through the season and this year because of the rehabilitation programme which is going on we had to stop our ginneries for maintenance some time in March and at that time we had stocks enough to la
st the local mills for about two months that's through to May and we thought uh given the fact that uh we would be having }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 a new season by June we would have at least had uh enough cotton to keep them going starting from the new season <#/>Normal
ly the mills are supposed to sort of close at least for a month uh to carry out some maintenance of their plants <#/>Now what happened uh particularly with respect to plants in Dar es Salaam uh French Textile Mill the their plants uh didn't tie with our p
lants and unfortunately it happened that they had to stop production some time in <-/>in May but they resumed production immediately after a month and now things are more or less back to normal
\par <$A> <#/>You mentioned about }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  the rehabilitation programme <#/>How far have you gone on that one }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$B> <#/>Well the rehabilitation programme uh has been going on for the last two and a half years now and it's funded by the Dutch government in co-operation with our government <#/>It's supposed to come
 to an end uh by mid next year and the plan was to rehabilitate about four hundred gins in the Western cotton-growing area U<#/>p to now we've managed to rehabilitate about three hundred and two gins and we hope to complete the task by <-/>by June
\par <$A> <#/><ea/>Ndugu Mdope <-_on><+_in> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  May this year you held uh had <-_>you held<-/> a workshop group <-_in><+_for> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
 cotton growers in the country uh <#/>What <-_were><+_was> the purpose of that workshop and what came out of it 
\par <$B> <#/>Well the
 purpose of that workshop uh actually was to try and address ourselves to the problems uh affecting cotton production in this country given the fact that cotton is one of the major export commodities in Tanzania <#/>So we had uh various people from uh the
 
party and the government from all cotton-growing regions assembled in Mwanza for a week and we discussed various problems which are affecting this production trend and one of the major issues which came out uh was that uh research seemed to be lagging beh
ind uh production and extension also wasn't uh very well catered for and uh the government is now taking serious measures to try and rectify this situation
\par <$A> <#/>And how about uh the peasants who are growing cotton <#/>What incentives are you giving to them 
\par <$B> <#/>We try <-_>we try<-/> to make sure that uh one the price the producer price it's uh adequately covers }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 their costs and that there that it leaves also a margin for them to keep going uh <#/>We also try and impress upon various authorities to make sure }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 that uh consumer goods are made available to these villages where cotton is grown uh <#/>We have examples whereby distribution systems have been uh a little bit uh unfair to cotton farmers in the sense that for example they 
grow cotton and one of the things which we always try and hammer home during our campaigns is that cotton it's }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 good for making cooking oil and uh uh uh textiles etcetera <#/>Now when the farmers produce this stuff and they don't get these commodities then uh it's <-/>it\rquote 
s a little bit counterproductive <#/>What we're trying to do is uh try and impress upon the various authorities }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 and make sure that these consumer goods are available to them and this <-/>this is sinking into people's minds and it looks as if we are on an upwards swing again
\par <$A> <#/>Yah and uh how about uh the competition in the world market <#/>How are we featuring 
\par <$B> <#/>Well <-_Tanzania><+_Tanzanian> cotton actually apparently happens to be one of those uh uh uh 
fibres which is <./>ver <./>ver very much in the mind and normally we have always fetched premium prices on the market because our cotton it's uh <-/>it's hand-picked and roller-ginned which is uh an old <-_phenomena><+_phenomenon> <#/>Nowadays you know w
ith mechanisation particularly in these big producing countries most of the uh harvesting and processing it's }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 uh mechanised and you don't get the same quality type of cotton like you get from our country and uh in that respect we haven't had any
 problems in selling our cotton except only when uh the market has been flooded with just too much cotton as the case is the case this year then we find some uh uh downward trend uh in the pricing uh mechanism 
\par <$A> <#/>How are we ranking in the world market 
\par <$B> <#/>Well we are a very very small producer Mr Mahmood <#/>We produce hardly zero point five per cent of the total world production of cotton uh that <#/>Three hundred thousand bales is just about that kind of percentage 
\par <$A> <#/>Yah
\par <$B> <#/>Yah <#/>The biggest producers as you know are the United States Russia China India and all these other Latin American countries 
\par <$A> <#/>Yah <ea/>Ndugu Mdope uh the General Manager of Tanzania Cotton Authority uh I understand that uh you'll be hosting two international conferences in Arusha uh <#/>Let us start with the International Institute for Cotton <#/>Who are the members and
 uh what are the activities 
\par <$B> <#/>Well the International Institute for Cotton in its short form it's IIC is a promotion and technical research organisation which was founded in nineteen sixty-six and actually it emanates from uh the ICAC which we'll be 
talking about later and its membership comprises <-_of> }{\b\fs24\lang2057 &/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  uh apparently Tanzania uh India Mexico Spain Sudan United Arab Republic United States Uganda Ivory Coast and a recent member it's }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 
<&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  uh Zimbabwe and I think we have also Greece on the list
\par <$A> <#/>And uh what <-_are><+_is> the purpose of this meeting which is going be uh held in Arusha 
\par <$B> <#/>Well this is an annual meeting uh where various topics will be discussed uh and they all concern about }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  major policy issues uh pertai
ning to cotton in various cotton-growing countries given the fact that uh cotton it's }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  one of the major export commodities for seventy-five countries in the world 
\par <$A> <#/>uh Where <-_were><+_was> the last meeting held and what were the recommendations
\par <$B> <#/>The last meeting was held uh last year I think in August in Memphis in the United States and at that uh meeting they discussed the annual budget and uh }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057 
 technical research and developing programme for the nineteen eighty-three eighty-four year and in the coming session we are going to have a review of what has been going on during the last year and discuss the programmes for the coming year 
\par <$A> <#/>And uh besides uh holding the International Institute for Cotton uh you have the forty-third plenary meeting of the International Cotton Advisory Committee that is ICAC uh <#/>Would you mind to }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 tell }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057  us uh a brief background about ICAC and uh what uh are you going to discuss in Arusha
\par <$B> <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Now Mr Mahmood uh 
ICAC is an association of governments uh having an interest in the production export import and consumption of cotton Its main emphasis is designed to promote co-operation in the solution of cotton problems particularly those of international scope It co-
o
perates <-_>it co-operates<-/> closely with uh UN FAO ONCTA etcetera and its main <-_functions><+_function> is to observe and keep close touch with developments affecting the world cotton situation and also it disseminates to member countries uh statistic
s uh on world cotton production trade consumption stocks and prices uh I\rquote 
d summarise and say therefore ICAC is there to afford a continuous understanding of the world cotton situation and provide a forum of international consultation and discussion 
\par <$A> <#/>uh Since the last meeting which was held in Memphis as you said uh what uh what <-_have><+_has> come out of it I mean 
\par <$B> <#/>Last year uh there weren't uh very many serious issues uh which were discussed apart from developments which have been going o
n by way of uh <-_legislations><+_legislation> for the cotton agreement under the auspices of ONCTA in Geneva As you might have heard we have come to more or less a stalemate position whereby that agreement is more or less not forthcoming and uh the big p
roducers I <-/>I won't mention names here are insistent that uh the <./>cot cotton if there is going to be any cotton agreement at all then it's got to be under the auspices of uh ICAC and not United Nations 
\par <$A> <#/><-/>Hmm Therefore they still regard ICC as uh
\par <$B> <#/>The major forum for discussing cotton policy issues 
\par <$A> <#/><-/>Hmm uh About this conference in Arusha I understand you are going to be host of that conference What preparations have you done <&/>}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 lexeme}{\v\fs24\lang2057  uh for that conference and how are 
we going to participate in that <-/>countr conference
\par <$B> <#/>We uh on our part as a host country we have made all the necessary arrangements We we're expecting about two hundred and fifty delegates from various parts of the world and uh we've made all th
e necessary preparations for their transport and accommodation and also sightseeing uh As you know Arusha is endowed with this uh rich uh heritage We have in this country Ngorongoro Lake Manyara etcetera and we hope these delegates after <-/>after their s
essions in uh <-/>in Arusha will have time to spare to go and visit the national parks and see <-_how><+_what> Tanzania looks like 
\par <$A> <#/>And uh for how long is this conference going to 
\par <$B> <#/>The conference is going to be about one week We'll have uh
 first the IIC on the thirteenth and fourteenth and fifteenth through to the nineteenth we'll be having the ICAC and in between we'll have a seminar whereby scientists uh leading scientists on <-/>on cotton will be tabling various papers on research

\par <$A> <#/>And uh can you give us just a breakdown of the programme <-_on><+_of> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\v\fs24\lang2057  the forty-third ICAC conference 
\par <$B> <#/>Well we expect the delegates to start arriving on the twelfth of uh this month and as I said earlier the thirteenth and fourteenth h
ave been designated for the IIC meeting and on the fifteenth we hope our His Excellency our President will be opening uh the International Cotton Advisory Committee meeting and this meeting is going to be chaired by the Minister of Agriculture and Livesto
c
k Development Professor <name/> uh One of the major <-_topic><+_topics> which is going to be discussed will be on the genetic environment and handling factors that affect the quality of cotton uh The agenda is fairly long and I wouldn't like to dwell on i
t because <-_it's><+_there are> about fifteen agendas and some of these typical annual meetings is going to be the budget }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057  for the coming <-_>for the coming<-/> year's programmes 
\par <$A> <#/><ea/>Ndugu Mdope I understand that the TCA is going to be transformed into a marketing board uh uh What does that imply 
\par <$B> <#/>Well as the name implies it means uh it's TCA is now going to change its name from Cotton Authority to Cotton Marketing Board and as the name implies uh we are going to be more concer
ned about marketing of cotton both internally and externally uh whereas as an authority we were charged with the responsibility of looking after the crop right from the fields to marketing Now that function is being taken The <-/>the production part of it
 
is being taken over by the Minister of Agriculture and Livestock Development and the primary marketing is going to be handled by the co-operative unions in processing and the Cotton Marketing Board will be solely responsible for export marketing and selli
ng cotton to local mills 
\par <$A> <#/>So what will be the role of the co-operative union in Tanzania 
\par <$B> <#/>Well the co-operatives uh will as I said earlier will handle primary marketing and also assist the villages or corporate societies in the provision of inputs hence production and also handle the transport and ginning of the crop
\par <$A> <#/>And what are the problems affecting cotton growers in the country at the moment and uh uh what is Tanzania Cotton Authority doing to help the farmers
\par <$B> <#/>Well we 
uh farmers have a host of problems I must say and as far as uh cotton production is concerned I think it's The main <-_>the main<-/> problem is the timely supply of uh cotton inputs At times you find because of the economic situation obtaining in the coun
try there are some delays in delivering these inputs in time and this does to a certain extent affect production uh What we try to do is in authorities to try and impress upon the various authorities in the <-_>in the<-/> government system to make sure }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057  that we have these inputs in <-/>in time for distribution to the farmers The other problem I think it's uh availability of uh }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 consumer goods There's no point in having so much money after having laboured all that time if there are no go
ods to buy with that money which has been obtained so again as I said earlier we're trying to impress upon the various uh government authorities to make sure }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 that at least some of those essential commodities are made available to them 
\par <$A> <#/
>Sometimes uh uh cotton growers or rather crop other crop cash-crop growers in the country have been complaining about uh these crop authorities that uh they buy the products but they don't give the money in cash uh Do you face these same problems 
\par <$B> <#/>Yes we do very much so uh At times it's <-/>it's just a question that we are overpowered uh when the farmers bring in their produce in large quantities and we have certain <-_limitating><+_limiting> factor factors uh which make us not provide }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057  uh enough money at the village go-downs Now what happens it's }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 uh In the past we used to buy cotton on credit arrangements and this was agreed uh with the various regional authorities We used to buy on credit for a week and then pay them a week
 later but that was thought to be counterproductive so it was thought that the best incentive would be to pay them as they delivered their produce but unfortunately because of these various <./>limit limiting <./>fac factors uh also transport fuel shortag
es we\rquote ve found ourselves at times landed with this problem whereby we can't cope with the situation but we try and make sure that money is made available immediately as soon as it's finished 
\par <$A> <#/><ea/>Ndugu Mdope you're also dealing with the <-/>the seed uh How do you handle uh seed marketing 
\par <$B> <#/>Well uh seed First of all we normally set aside seed for planting which is distributed between the months of uh August through to September and October and thereafter we whatever is left over it's }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{
\v\fs24\lang2057  uh allocated to the various uh oil mills for crushing depending on the their various capacities At the moment most of the installed capacity it's }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 mainly concentrated in the lake uh <-/>lake zone and in the coastal belt i e Dar es Salaam coast region Morogoro Tanga Kilimanjaro etcetera we have two big mills i e Mopoko and <?/>Rajan oil industries here in Dar es Salaam 
\par <$A> <#/>Do you have your own processing plants for the seed 
\par <$B> <#/>At the moment uh no I'd say we are <-_>we are<-/> looking after mills which were owned by the co-operative unions and these are going to be handed over by <name/> to the newly established co-operative unions We are at the moment also constructing
 one refinery in Shinyanga region and we have a stake in uh Morogoro Oil Mill Processing Company This is Morproco and we don't envisage to build }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 any more mills because the installed capacities are already more than adequate according to the available seeds 
\par <$C> <#/>The General Manager of the Tanzania Cotton Authority <ea/>Ndugu Magnus Mdope discussing the general performance of the cotton industry in Tanzania <ea/>Ndugu Mdope has also dealt <-_on><+_with> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>or dwelt on}{\v\fs24\lang2057  the various efforts made by the authority to maximise cotton production in the country Besides offering fitting incentives to peasants the move also aims at rehabilitatin
g cotton <-/ginneries> and finding solutions to chronic transportation problems which hinder the ferrying of cotton from villages to the <-/ginneries> hence to the textiles The General Manager has also pointed out problems which directly affect farmers li
k
e the failure to deliver agricultural inputs in time and the failure to pay them promptly These are some of the problems whose solution will be partly found in the reinstallation of co-operative societies which will among other tasks show their responsibi
lity of delivering inputs and effecting payments to farmers He was interviewed by <name/> Mahmood for Face the Mike }{\fs24\lang2057 </X></I>

Facing the microphone this week is Mr Sebastian Kingo the Honorary Secretary of the newly-formed Materials Management Association of Tanzania }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Mr Kingo maybe we could start our session by first listening from you }{\b\v\fs24 
<&/>lexeme}{\fs24  what made you to start}{\b\fs24  }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  such an association on materials management
\par <$B> <#/>Thank you very much uh Mr Mbunde for giving me this opportunity so that I can highlight some few items on Materials Management Association of Tanzania uh }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Materials Management Association of Tanzania has been formed uh officially registered }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar/tense}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 
on twelfth September nineteen ninety uh under the rules of uh societies and it has been recently inaugurated on thirtieth September ninety ninety-four with the patron being the Honourable Nalaila Kiula Minister for Works Communications and Transport

\par <$A> <#/>Mr Kingo what are the objectives of the association
\par <$B> <#/>First the main objectives of the Materials Management Association in Tanzania are mainly as follows uh }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24  }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 First one is to encourage the exchange of ideas among materials
 management professionals and practitioners and promote the image and development of the profession }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Secondly it's to arrange for periodical meetings of members delivery of lectures reading of papers on subjects of professional or topical interest and t
o disseminate by any other means information considered to be of value to members and generally to promote the interests of members not forgetting uh to afford }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24 
 as a means of communication between the association other professional bodies and authorities
\par <$A> <#/>Mr Kingo your being the Honorary Secretary of the Material Management Association of Tanzania that's MMAT having heard the objectives maybe our listeners now would like to know if you have any branches up country or in the regions
\par <$B> <#/>uh The association has just been recently uh inaugurated though it\rquote s since it\rquote s been registered since nineteen ninety }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Now after the official inauguration we are now trying to chart out the operations and of course we expect to operate throughout the country uh }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Right now we already have members uh }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
We have about seventy-five members as at }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24  thirtieth September nineteen ninety-four and these they come from different uh parts of the country }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 We have members for example from Tanga Sumbawa
nga uh and Mwanza now but our plan is that we are going to establish regional chapters as we go along
\par <$A> <#/>Well as you said that you are on your way to establish the regional chapters as you go along but maybe our listeners will also like to know uh who are the office bearers }{\b\fs24  }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 as up to thirtieth September nineteen ninety-four
\par <$B> <#/>uh Thank you very much Mr Mbunde uh }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 During the annual the first annual general meeting which was uh held on thirtieth <./>Sep September nineteen ninety-fou
r at the British Council Conference Hall the patron Honourable Nalaila Kiula the Minister for Works Communications and Transport remained the same while the following were elected in the governing council for the next four years }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{
\fs24 We have Mr uh Edwin Mkisi who's a management consultant with SMW Management Consultants as Chairman }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>T}{\fs24 
hen Ahmed Kilima the supplies manager of Tazara was elected as the Vice-Chairman and myself uh I was elected the honorary secretary }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Then we have a Mr Alfred Kinyundo a ma
nagement <-_consultants><+_consultant> with CTMS was elected as Treasurer and the other six counsellors were who were elected that day were as follows Mbesa Malambugi }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
She is a lecturer at IFM as a counsellor Odina Kalenga a senior supplies officer with TFMC a counsellor uh Veronica Mlowezi a senior supply officer with Tanzania Breweries }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 She is a counsellor }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
We have Thompson Kayuni a management consultant also as a counsellor <./>Benedic Benedict Semfukwe a supplies manager with Tanzania Breweries
 a counsellor and we have uh Mr O Msafiri the director of supplies and purchasing of Tanzania Harbours <./>Author Authority as a counsellor as well
\par <$A> <#/>Well Mr Kingo Sebastian people are now wondering that you have started this uh materials management association and there is the National Materials Board }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Does it mean that the Board is now phasing out to give way to your association }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Maybe now you will be in a good position at least to elaborate }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\b\fs24  }{\fs24 if there is any difference between Mater
ials Management Association and the National Materials Board
\par <$B> <#/>uh Thank you very much Mr Mbunde uh }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 This question is a common one we've been asked by several other people but we would like to elaborate }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24  that the National Board for Mater
ials Management is there to stay and the uh Materials Management Association of Tanzania is also a different <./>ass a <-/>a different body }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Now the main difference is that the National Board for Materials Management is uh a government institution which
 has been formed through Act Number Nine of nineteen eighty-one while the Materials Management Association of Tanzania is a voluntary association of materials management professionals }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
So <-/>so much for the difference but we also have uh some common areas whereby uh we share interests }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Now as I have already mentioned one of the objectives of the association is to afford a means of communication between the association and other professional bodies and authorities }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 In this case the MMAT will <-/>wi
ll provide a forum to materials management professionals so that they can come out and discuss issues of common interest with the National Board of Materials Management so that the development of }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 materials management profession can be afforded }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Now of course uh uh one would also try to uh go further and say we as professionals in our association we would like to make use of our association as I said as a forum to communicate with different authorities including the Board itself }{\fs24\lang2057 
<#/>}{\fs24 For example we have come to notice that uh the profession itself the materials management profession in the country has not been so much publicised and we think this is one of the duties which could have been done by the Board }{
\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Now let's say through common meetings with the Board we will discuss together }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24  and try to see how uh we can contribute }{\b\v\fs24 <+_to>}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 promote the profession together
\par <$A> <#/>Mr Kingo an additional question there }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 You have mentioned something which is very interesting maybe our listeners would like to know }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
You know running of an association this causes a lot of problems and I wonder whether MMAT or Materials Management Association of Tanzania has ever been facing}{\b\fs24  }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  any problems since its 
inception in nineteen ninety as you said
\par <$B> <#/>Now thank you very much }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 As we are we're we have recently experienced an inauguration and that means now we are ready uh to start our operations so that we can save our members and the public }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{
\fs24 Now our <-/>our main source of funds for financing our operations will mainly be through the uh entry fees of our members as well as annual subscription from our men }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
But apart from that we uh expect to provide uh consultantcy services in future }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Now throug
h these consultant services definitely we are going to charge fees which will be ploughed back in the association to keep the association running }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Now uh also since we are starting we <-/>we are going to of course approach uh the parent I mean the <./>M
inis <-/>the Ministry of Works Communications and Transport uh since it is the ministry concerned with the development of this profession maybe to give us uh uh help especially during this uh start-up stage which we need some help }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}
{\fs24  so that uh later on we can uh finance ourselves
\par <$A> <#/>Well after having that very <-/elaborative> answer Mr Kingo now maybe it is high time uh }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 We always know that among the questions that people have been asking on materials management in the developing countrie
s such as Tanzania is how are you going to educate the people on the mission of your association to both your members and the public at large because as you have said that your association it\rquote 
s very new and not many people that are aware that it's working }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Now do you have any strategies that uh can make your association be known }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  to the public so far
\par <$B> <#/>uh This is a very interesting question }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Now first of all I would like to say that it is very unfortunate that this profession has not
 delivered <./>ha has not delivered the expected goods to the people and uh it is also uh very unfortunate that today we are almost marking more than ten years of the existence of the National Board of Materials Management in Tanzania }{\fs24\lang2057 
<#/>}{\fs24 Now we feel that uh in the association that this the profession of materials management uh is has been uh very much misunderstood }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
For example uh we are we understand that our mission in fact is to try to help the users of our professional expertise to minimise the cost of their material inputs }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Since uh it is a professional fact that in the modern times the biggest cost factor in both production and service organisations is towards materials management and hence uh one would if <-/>if one would like to follow up }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
I mean through the financial statements of very of different organisations uh it can be seen that it is now almost more than sixty per cent of the budgets and to some extent if you take the construction uh industry it goes even up to eighty per cent of th
eir budgets uh in one way or another used uh uh in relation to materials management uh aspects }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 So the <./>misu I mean mismanagement of materials might mean uh a <./>non-atta attainment of of objectives of main organisations }{
\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Our mission our professional mission in materials management is to help the user of our expertise to minimise the costs of input of material inputs }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Now uh this mission has not very well been understood and as a result up to now I'm sorry to say we are I mean the profession has
 not been used uh to our satisfaction and it also shows that most of our would-be users of our professional expertise they're still uh not happy with our services }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
So one of our one of the first activities of <-/>of <-/>of Materials Management Association of Tanzania will be to try to create the awareness to the public }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>idiom}{\fs24 
 that uh the profession of materials management can really solve part of their uh uh cost elements and we think without creating this awareness then it will be very difficult for us to be accepted }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
As we know up to now our profession has been so much misused to the extent that the public and even the employers most of them have negative attitude to our people uh }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Negative attitude to our people in the sense that most of our people take us as you know there <-/>there is a common saying in the streets these are always I mean ten per cent people or <-/>or things of that sort }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Now so after creating the awareness through publicity I mean using the different types of news media then we would embark ourselves into}{\b\v\fs24 <&/>idiom/prep}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 uh providing consultancy services to those who\rquote 
ll respond to our uh awareness creation }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 So by doing this we think uh the public or the main users of our services who are mainly <./>emp <./>emp employers will understand us and they will need our services }{\fs24\lang2057 
<#/>}{\fs24 But all the same on the same line that the Board uh has been given a very powerful uh mandate by the act of parliament through Act Number Nine of nineteen ninety-one to control uh the the profession and
 the professionals themselves but uh we are most of the materials management professionals are really wondering what is happening after ten years of NBMM existence }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Still uh some especially the government institutions don't seem to care uh mostly in tha
t in <-/>in Act Number Nine of nineteen ninety-one there uh is part six which talks uh mainly on the effects of uh <-_>effects of<-/> registration and consequences of non-registration of materials management professionals Now this part has been uh }{
\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 As w
e say the Board has done a good job in training especially in training the materials management professionals but when it comes to monitoring what these people are supposed to do in the field uh we are sorry to say this has been the Board has registered a
lmost total failure }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Now this is one of the aspects which we think we have to sit down and <-/>and <-/>and sit together and discuss with the National Board of Materials Management how uh we can work together so that the profession can help the public the way it\rquote 
s supposed to provide uh the professional services
\par <$A> <#/>Mr Sebastian Kingo you being the Honorary Secretary of the MMAT or Materials Management Association of Tanzania you have been mentioning of }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24  professionalism in your association }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Maybe now you'll be in a good position at least to tell us what are the ethics of materials management professionals }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24 <$B> <#/>uh Thank you Mr Mbonde uh This is a very interesting question and in fact uh professional ethics or we have the <-/>t
he <-/>the uh a professional code of conduct which is administered by the National Board of Materials Management Now this is the place where I say that the National Board of Materials Management is supposed to to act like uh I mean a traffic to monitor <-
_
>to monitor<-/> all the people or all people who want to practise the materials management profession Now there is a process which is known as registration of professionals and this one as I have mentioned that this is what is uh <-_>what is<-/> stipulate
d
 in the Act Number Nine of nineteen ninety-one and <-/>and part six uh with sub-sections twenty to twenty-three Now in this area there is the stress of adhering to the professional code of conduct but up to now if you take our Tanzanian case you find that
 
I mean this <-/>this profession has been <./>practi is <-/>is <-/>is <-/>is still being practised by people who are not yet registered by the Board and just to give you uh a highlight is that uh in nineteen ninety-three after a very uh intensive follow-up
 
of by then uh the Deputy Minister of Works our Honourable Segema Msuimwa the Board that was once directed and reminded to <-/>to be I mean to try to enforce the implementation of <-/>of <-/>of part six of the Act but uh what the Board did is that it did a
 <./>co <-/>a <-/>a survey and to their good results }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>idiom}{\v\fs24 
 is that about five hundred <-_>five hundred<-/> employees were identified to <-/>to be I mean as practitioners who were practising without registration Now this uh uh <-/>this big number of peop
le who are working who are posing themselves as <-/>as <-/>as materials management professionals without registration and sometimes without even proper training and these are the people who really have helped to tarnish uh the good image of materials mana
g
ement and because these people you know it's they're uh <-/>they <-_>they are<-/> not <-_binded><+_bound> by the professional ethics then they are the <-/>the <-/>the people uh whom really they are free to practise everything So uh uh within that I mean t
h
e professional code of conduct is there and we would really remind the National Board of Materials Management that the time has come after they have identified those five hundred people since last year I mean the Act has said very openly that uh people wh
o are uh practising without proper registration and training as materials management profession }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24 
 they should be convicted but up to now to our surprise uh there is no employer neither employee or uh out of those five hundred who has been convicte
d So uh you can see how the honest <-_>the honest<-/> registered uh materials professionals are really very much concerned about this because their profession has is <-/>is <-/>is being misused uh by both I mean I'm sorry to say even some of the chief exe
c
utives in some organisations what they know is only using our professionals in the negative way I mean they would like since this is the part which uh <-/>which uh I mean uses the biggest funds of the organisations then our professionals sometimes they've
 
been subjected to act <-_unethical><+_unethically> by their chief executives Now taking all these uh we say as an association now we have said enough is enough We think time has come so that our profession cannot deliver the expected <-->the expected<-/> 
services to employers and any other would-be clients
\par <$A> <#/>If one wants to join your association the Materials Management Association of Tanzania what should he or she do and does she or he need to have any qualification for joining }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24  your association
\par <$B> <#/>Now our association as I say is a professional association and for the time being we uh <-/>we want to recruit as many members as possible and the minimum qualification to being member is anybody who has an Advanced Diploma in materials ma
nagement or first degree in materials management uh or its equivalent and it\rquote s very easy Somebody just has just to get a membership application and admission form and pays a <-/>a fee of five thousand five hundred shillings
\par <$A> <#/>And lastly although not the least what will be your future plans and if you have any call to both the users of the services of the materials management professionals and to the authority in the country and especially to your current ministry that
\rquote s the Ministry of Works if you have any call to all those
\par <$B> <#/>Thank you very much uh To finish off I would like to <-/>to <-/>to make a call to the employers that uh time uh they should now take up as let us try to start afresh and come up for consultancy services through the associ
ation so that I mean they can uh get }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\v\fs24  how they can better utilise the expertize of materials management professionals So let the employers or any other clients be free }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>idiom}{\v\fs24 
 to contact the association for consultancy services and also I would
 like to make a call to the National Board of Materials Management that the association has been formed not as an organ so that we can fight each other I mean this is uh an organ which is supposed in fact to work uh We would like to have a very close rela
t
ionship with the National Board of Materials Management so that we work together and make this profession deliver the expected goods to the people of Tanzania And maybe just uh to sum up I would also call to our to my fellow professionals to come up and j
oin the association uh in big numbers

<&/>grammar/aspect }{\fs24\lang2057 many people <#/>Interviewed are Doct

enty-eighth October nineteen ninety-four
\par <$A> <#/>First we should like to know uh what are }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  the objectives of the camp which will be organised on Sunday the twenty-eighth of October nineteen ninety-four 
\par <$B> <#/>The aim of the camp is to screen the general mass by }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  medical check-up by doing urine and blood sugar examination for detecting new cases <O/> examination of diabetic patients and assist them }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  by providing the detailed information for their problems 
\par <$A> <#/>Yah <#/>You referred to the general audience Doctor Duwari you mean <-_that\rquote s><+_that> everybody\rquote s invited uh to the camp
\par <$B> <#/>Everyone is invited <-_in><+_to> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  the camp so that uh this will help the general mass and this will help us also for detecting }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  the new cases 
\par <$A> <#/>And what prompted you to organise the camp specifically in Dar es Salaam <#/>You mean it's a <-/>a place with uh many cases of diabetes or something related to that 
\par <$B> <#/>No it is not like that <#/>Actually last time we have organised }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar/tense}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 
this camp and that was one of the most successful <-_camp><+_camps> <#/>We have tried to organise a camp in Lindi and Mwanza but uh due to the lack of <?/>chemical and some problems we could not organise the camp las
t year but this year we are planning to organise it in the up-countries <#/>The prevalence of diabetes <-_have><+_has> got no concern with the <-/>the township 
\par <$A> <#/>Yah <#/>What can you tell us about the arrangements so far <#/>How many doctors are we expecting in the camp this year 
\par <$B> <#/>There are a team of twenty-five doctors and uh there are <-_>there are<-/> specialists of different fields <#/>They will be also staying in the camp 
\par <$A> <#/>Yeah <#/>Can you mention the specific <-/>specific fields because what uh a common man like myself <./>underst understands is that uh each uh of the doctors will be connected with <./>diabet diabetes or something related to that 
\par <$B> <#/>I'll give you a general outline of the camp but all the general masses 
who so will come in the camp they will be passed through the screening by the general medical check-up then urine and blood examination for sugar <#/>Those <-_patient><+_patients> who are detected as diabetes as diabetic <-_patient><+_patients> and the kn
own diabetic cases they }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 will be sent to the consultant chambers <#/>The consultants are there for the medical specialities consultant surgeon consultant gynaecologist paediatrician dietician optomologist and in this way it means I can say all th
e consultant facilities are there and after the camp we will be providing them if uh we get the medicine the medicine will be provided to them free as well as one of the <-_book><+_books> which gives a detailed information for the diabetes that will be pr
ovided free 
\par <$A> <#/>uh Thank you Doctor Duwari uh but we would like to know generally what is diabetes }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$B> <#/>Actually diabetes I can say as everyone knows that a motor car needs <-_a> petrol to give energy to travel along the road in the sa
me way our body needs food which gives energy to work and play After eating they start containing food <#/>They are broken down into sugar in the digestive system <#/>Then it passes from }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  gut to }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  blood It's carried to different parts of }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  body to give energy In the <-_abdominant><+_abdominal> cavity of our body we are having }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 
<&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  an organ called <-_as> pancreas which produces a substance known as insulin <#/>This insulin in the people who do not have diabetes is produc
ed by the pancreas to help sugar to get inside the tissue and to keep the blood sugar level at }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  normal level but the person with diabetes has }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{
\fs24\lang2057 pancreas which is unable to produce insulin to unable }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  blood sugar to be used as fuel and to keep blood sugar normal so the blood sugar rises to }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{
\fs24\lang2057  high level <#/>This is known as diabetes 
\par <$A> <#/>I see it's a complicated system Doctor Duwari uh but uh one would wonder uh because you have mentioned that uh within the system
 what is uh involved is food uh <#/>You mean it's uh food which contains sugar or any type of food which can lead to such complications 
\par <$B> <#/>No actually you can say that mostly the starch food are excess }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  of sugar containing food 
\par <$A> <#/>Yah and uh what is actually the source of this failure of the pancreas to perform their duty 
\par <$B> <#/>Actually the cause of this is not yet known 
\par <$A> <#/>It can be as a result of some other side effects maybe 
\par <$B> <#/>No this can be a secondary cause 
\par <$A> <#/>So it means when we would like to dwell critically on what are the causes of diabetes }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  uh what can we find actually Doctor Duwari
\par <$B> <#/>Actually the causes of diabetes we do not know exactly what are the causes of diabetes }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 There are number of different causes which are not yet fully understood but obesity should be avoided in the diabetes 
\par <$A> <#/>uh You have so far mentioned that there are so many cause of diabetes but most <-/>most of them are not yet understood <#/>Do 
you mean whose task is it for uh <#/>Is it the task of doctors to carry out <./>res researches on these causes or how can you <-_>can you<-/> put it 
\par <$B> <#/>There are a lot of researches going on }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_on}{\b\fs24\lang2057 >}{\fs24\lang2057  }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  diabetes but uh no-one has yet established
 one cause that this is the only reason for <-_the> diabetes 
\par <$A> <#/>uh Let's cite the case of Tanzania <#/>Are we having any research }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  which is conducted on diabetes 
\par <$B> <#/>Yes in Tanzania we are having }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  a Tanzania Diabetic Association and uh it is the chairman of the Tanzanian Diabetic Association is Professor <name/> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 and he is doing the research on <-_the> diabetes 
\par <$A> <#/>And what has been the recent findings of their research 
\par <$B> <#/>That I think uh Doctor Ruisa can tell you because he is working with uh Doctor <name/> 
\par <$C> <#/>Well maybe what I can say about the findings although they are not completely <O/> it would seem that we\rquote re beginning to get more and more cases of diabetes <#/>Now I\rquote m not saying that it\rquote 
s increasing <#/>That could mean <-_>that could mean<-/> only that we are now patients are now coming they are turning up for treatment when they not used to do that }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 in the past <#/>So it's not <#/>The results are not yet out but I can say we <-/>we are <./>se <-_>we are<-/> seeing quite a number of patients turning up and as I said maybe it's because they are getting aware of their problems 
\par <$A> <#/>Yah and is it easy for a person to just <-/>to trace himself that he's having }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  that disease 
\par <$C> <#/>Yes there are some certain <-_sign><+_signs> and symptoms of the disease so like uh I can tell you the most common sign and symptoms like frequent urination excessive drinking of water weight loss weakness and 
irritability frequent infection of his skin and gums blurring of vision slow healing of wounds <#/>If someone is having }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 such <-_type><+_types> of problem that person the person should go and approach the doctor and get himself thoroughly investigated for diabetes and }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057 
 Tanzanian Diabetic Association is providing all these facilities <#/>They are free of cost to the patients 
\par <$A> <#/>Yah how long does it take for one to discover that he has contacted such a disease as diabetes <#/>Is it so sooner like wound say }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$C> <#/>No as soon as he notices this problem if he approaches a clinic it takes hardly I can say if we investigate him thoroughly it is a matter of half an hour 
\par <$B> <#/>Maybe I could add it's a bit tricky you know <#/>Sometimes the patient can come with wounds <#/>He's been having wounds }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 on the back on the buttocks for about a whole year maybe a few years maybe years }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 then only we are looking after the <-_>after the<-/> <-/>the <-/>the absce
sses we find out that he's actually diabetic so it can be as well that <#/>On the other hand it can be so sudden that your patient becomes unconscious he just got unconscious because of diabetes and you find that it's because of diabetes and he says that 
I was previously well maybe last the two weeks except that I was feeling a bit thirsty so it's quite variable I can't say there's a <-/>a fixed term you can put on it 
\par <$A> <#/>Now and is it infectious 
\par <$C> <#/>No it is not infectious <#/>It\rquote s just if you have that disease you stay with it you are not going to submit it to another person not even to your to your wife or anything it's not infectious 
\par <$A> <#/>I see and suppose I'm <-/>I'm having the disease }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  <#/>I'm suffering from disease I mean uh can my uh my <-/>my son or my daughter suffer all the same from the <-_>from the<-/> disease 
\par <$C> <#/>That that's comes from what Doctor Duwari has just mentioned in that there may actually be some genetic uh <-/>genetic element <#/>It can be inherited <#/>In some cases it <-/>it runs in }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057 
 family <#/>It's not <-_>it's not<-/> a very strong one as you'd say uh the father was dark skin the son will be dark skin but quite a weak association but there is a <-_tendence><+_tendency> for this disease 
to run in families and if there is an inheritable element therefore so that one of the children might have it from the grandfather or the father 
\par <$A> <#/>Yeah one also wonders how diabetes can be cured Doctor Ruisa
\par <$C> <#/>Now this there's no cure for di
abetes <#/>I think that's uh unfortunate to say there's no <-_>there's no<-/> cure for diabetes as such and uh except what I can say is sometimes in the early stages when you get the disease there <-/>there may be a period which we call the honeymoon <#/>
You see someone comes diabetes is discovered for the first time and then after about a few months he seems to be you know <-_>to be<_/> getting better <#/>In fact he may get off all the drugs and he says I\rquote 
m cured but we call this <-/>this a honeymoon and we are sure in a few <-_>in a few<-/> months it will come up }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057 
 and he becomes a diabetic permanently and we are not going to be able to cure this and this maybe might explain why that's what I think because there are some people who say they can cu
re diabetes actually even our traditional healers <#/>Now I I've been wondering whether this is not the honeymoon they are calling a cure I don\rquote t know <-/>don't quite <-/known> that but that's my fear about these <-/>these claims
\par <$A> <#/>uh I\rquote m worried Do
ctor Ruisa because we are talking in view of the camp which will be conducted on Sunday the twenty-eighth of <./>Octo <-/> of October nineteen ninety-four uh <#/>What makes me fear is that maybe uh because you've said that there is no cure as such for dia
betes then people\rquote ll just consider the camp as useless 
\par <$C> <#/>No that's <-/>that's not true uh It\rquote s <-/>it\rquote s even if you cannot cure you can control <#/>For instance if you got someone with a broken arm now if you <-/>you can produce you can make a hook 
and he can use that one a whole year and <-/>and do other functions <#/>For instance uh uh Doctor Duwari has said the pancreas is diseased it's not working but through <-/>through this intensive research which has been going on we know it is insulin which
 
is not effective which is not <-_>which is not<-/> present or it's not enough of quantities and through the same research we have it now insulin is available so maybe if you bottle it put in bottles the patient can use it by uh by <-/>by <-/>by injecting 
himself or <-/>or if I could just speak about the treatment of diabetes as such 
\par <$A> <#/><-/>Mhm
\par <$C> <#/>There are actually three approaches to this problem <#/>One of them is by diet the other one is you can use tablets uh to control uh the problem and t
he other one is you can use insulin as <-/>as an injection as an injectable form <#/>Now for diet the aim with diet is to keep the person <-_in><+_at> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
 a good weight to maintain a normal weight <#/>There are <-_>there are<-/> charts which show for the given height <-/>height and age this patient should have a certain weight
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Now with these charts you can know how <-/>how heavy the patient should have should maintain his <./>ex ideal weight and <./>one once that is made then even if he's diabetic it's
 better to <./>con it's easier to control it So that all the time should be looked after and every diabetic should be taken care of The next thing is use of tablets uh and there's a type <-/>type of diabetes actually there are two main types One will need
 
insulin completely another usually does not need the insulin It can be diet alone Now if that second type which does not need the insulin cannot be controlled on diet alone now this patient can be given tablets These tablets can do help a whole year with 
t
he insulin The insulin <-/>insulin which the pancreas has got can be raised in more and better quantities and in that uh <./>help helped to bring the sugar down and so the patient becomes more or less normal and for those patients who need insulin complet
e
ly who cannot do without insulin these are called the insulin dependent diabetics and these actually they are <-_>they are<-/> rather young people really starting from young children to something around twenty It's not very clear-cut but most of these wil
l be young people and all these ones }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 will need the insulin and the <-/>the doses <-_>the doses<-/> again differ the <-_frequent><+_frequency> of injections and the <-_>and the<-/> type of the insulin and the rate of injection this can only be de
termined of course by a doctor not by the patient but with these three approaches a diabetic can live an almost normal life So the <-/>the things are not <O/> Even though we don't know the cause the disease is part maybe among the few diseases we can almo
st completely control with more <-_>with more<-/> than therapy 
\par <$A> <#/>And will a patient ever be able to stop treatment with insulin or tablets 
\par <$C> <#/>uh Maybe I can put it this way I said before that some patients who don't need the insulin can be controlled <-_on><+_by> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 diet Now <-/>now you can move either way Some patients who are controlled on diet may get worse and need tablets On the other hand some patients who are on tablets may get better and need only diet Now going <-/>going to the 
question of insulin if we said a patient is insulin dependent now this patient by definition cannot do without insulin but I mentioned previously the honeymoon period In this period the patient might temporarily not need insulin but if he was insulin depe
ndent <O/> need the insulin and maybe the dose may be less and less but it is we need the insulin I think that is what I can say So there's }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 kind of shift from one to the other but of course I said there's no cure as such
\par <$A> <#/>And when you mentioned that one would probably think that uh the appropriate diet for somebody who is suffering from diabetes maybe it is something without sugar is it true 
\par <$C> <#/>I think that's certainly true The <-/>the <-/>main thing I can say about diet is the die
t should contain uh not the simple sugars maybe for <-/>for a general person you can say sweet <-/>sweet the sweet carbohydrates this sugar used for tea for glucose honey sweets chocolate the sweet cakes these should be avoided because they are they provi
de very rapid }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 sugar levels in blood and these are best avoided but however to <-/>to get energy one has to use <-/>use carbohydrates so you can use complex ones like starch and you say these days maybe the best carbohydrates are those which are not refined just <-/>ju
s
t maize ground maize without removing the husks is <-/>is the best I mean without <O/> and that's the best maize which can be should be used and <-/>and that's why Otherwise the other aspect of diet is we think as far as fats are concerned uh fats especia
lly the animal fats in diabetics have a tendency of causing }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 blood vessel disease and so it is recommended these patients should used should use uh if they are to use fat it should be these plant oils like from sunflower oil and <-/>and of course when they're using fat one has got to watch weight if he\rquote 
s underweight if he's overweight and then he's using fat he\rquote s going to get more and more fat That's the thing should be avoided 
\par <$A> <#/><-/>Mhm and what are generally the complications of the disease 
\par <$C> <#/>The complications of that if as I said before <-/>if the diabetes is controlled the patient can more or less lead a normal life but if it is not controlled or it is not diagnosed uh certain very serious complications can occur For instance as
 I said some patients can come for the first time in coma unconscious and so we call <-/>call this diabetic coma or diabetic <O/> Now this is a serious <./>com complication and the patient has be admitted and have insulin and many and quite a proportion o
f
 such patients will die even if you treat them The other one would have as I said before is the ulcers The diabetic somehow does not cannot fight other diseases normally so he'll get ulcers in the legs He'll get uh even <-/>even things like tuberculosis a
ctually find the <-_>find the<-/> diabetic quite a fertile soil so the other problem is this <-_tendence><+_tendency> to have infections which get serious but they wouldn't have <./>otherw otherwise gone }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 serious if he was not diabetic And then th
e others of course the especially the chronic in the chronic form if it's not properly controlled some patients lose their sexual strength some patients get kidney problems uh some patients get vascular disease of blood vessels and they get heart diseases
 
uh and in fact with the same heart disease blood vessel disease you can have uh strokes that is bleeding <-/>bleeding in the brain and a patient falling suddenly You can have high blood pressure It can affect the eyes and the patient may come with a catar
act this you get a white patch in the
\par <$A> <#/><-/>Mhm
\par <$C> <#/>in the pupil and many and even the retina the <./>sen <-/>the sensitive part for seeing light can be damaged because of bleeding and quite there are quite a <-/>a number of complications Maybe 
this <-/>this is quite a good list of what might happen if the diabetes is not properly controlled 
\par <$A> <#/>uh There is a general feeling Doctor Ruisa that not much attention has been directed to non-communicable diseases like diabetes Do you happen to sh
are the same feeling as regards this particular uh trend in which governments maybe are not paying the <-/>the attention which is deserved to non-communicable diseases 
\par <$C> <#/>Well it's true I must say understandably I mean you see usually we think about what is <-_>what is<-/> bothering us at that particular time Now if you got malaria you got }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 many <-_>you got many<-/> infections you got tuberculosis you tend to not think about these other problems and as you can see from previous medical <./>re reports if you go <-_>in><+_back to> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 the forties for instance you don't see <-_>you don't see<-/> diabetes being mentioned Even hypertension is not mentioned N
ow this is probably because there was preoccupation with other diseases or maybe the care as such was not able to detect the <-/>the patients were not seen as such Now <-/>now in this time }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 of course we <-/>we hope that we expect <-_>we expect<-/> that as we control these other diseases if you control tuberculosis and malaria and also increase our life expectancy By the way some of these diseases are for instance hypertension diabetes they 
}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057  are <-_>they are<-/> age dependent the more age }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 you tend to get more of this hypertension for instance Now as we control the diseases and increase our life expectancy these are going to be of our concern Maybe it's good that now we are trying starting to think about this because now it's bec
oming a problem I don't have to blame those in the sixties who did not pay very much attention Maybe there was they had more than enough of their share but now we should start erasing that now this is going this is also taking it's seen it's good <./>pol 
it's policy it's <./>mov it's shifting towards priorities and so we should start paying attention to this which is I think being rightly done at this time 
\par <$A> <#/><-/>Mhm uh Doctor Duwari maybe you can expand on why we should bother to control diabetes 
\par <
$B> <#/>You know one should try to control diabetes because a patient will stay free of symptoms and live a reasonably <./>norm normal life He will have more resistance to <-_the> infection He can prevent many <-_complication><+_complications> as explaine
d by Doctor Ruisa 
\par <$A> <#/>uh Suppose I'm suffering from diabetes uh what types of jobs should I avoid 
\par <$B> <#/>Actually diabetes does not affect the job responsibilities but uh it is best to avoid the job in which an insulin reaction could endanger the d
iabetic patient as well as the others A job with regular working hours is the best for the diabetic patient Usually therefore some of the jobs like uh working with unguarded or dangerous machineries The diabetic children they should be discouraged from cl
imbing the trees like that where it means particular attention is required This type of job should be avoided by the diabetic patients 
\par <$A> <#/>Yah and after uh the diabetic camp which will be organised by the Lions\rquote  Club of Dar es Salaam city on twenty-eighth October in nineteen}{\fs24\lang2057  }{\v\fs24\lang2057 ninety -four what can we look <-_at><+_in> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 
<&/>prep}{\v\fs24\lang2057  the future 
\par <$B> <#/>Actually after the camp those who are detected as a diabetic patient and as well as known diabetic patients they will be guided for the line of treatment and 
they will be guided to go and attend the clinic diabetic clinic assisted by the Tanzanian Diabetic Association and Muhimbili Medical Centre so that they can get <-_a><+_the> proper attention for their health and uh whatever the <-_complication><+_complica
tions> that come coming from the diabetes and they will be guided for uh uh uh maintaining their proper health and doses of the medicine and other things 
\par <$A> <#/>uh Thank you very much Lion Doctor Duwari from the Tanzania Occupational Health Service and D
octor Ruisa of the Muhimbili Medical Centre first of all for having spared your time to take part in our programme and for the interesting and relevant views you have volunteered to share with us in this programme You have been listening to Face the Mike

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <I> <$A> <#/>In today's programme of You and the Environment we have Mr William <?/>Kijoti of the Capital Development Authority CDA of the Dodoma <O/> who is the chief environment management officer <#/>Today we\rquote ll discuss on }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  the issue of afforestation and other environment protection projects <#/>What are the re
sponsibilities of your department under the auspices of CDA as the organ solely responsible for the development of this town
\par <$B> <#/>Uh the responsibility of my department is to make the city green by planting trees and ornamentals for purposes of erosion control visual enhancement recreation and eventually timber supply 
\par <$A> <#/>Uh I mean those uh those <-_seems><+_seem> to be much more of afforestation rather than protection environment <#/>Don\rquote t you have other projects to <-/>to enhance protection of environment
\par <$B> <#/>There are also other projects such as those of erosion control pollution control and advisory <-/>advisory services to people within the city on management of their environment
\par <$A> <#/>Now how was the situation of the Dodoma town before you started the afforestation projects
\par <$B> <#/>Before we started this project the town was bare dusty with the occasions of floods during the rainy season 
\par <$A> <#/>Uh and is it does it mean that those problems were mainly associated with the deforestation 
\par <$B> <#/>Sure <#/>Due to lack of trees or vegetation in general uh the city was experiencing a lot of uh strong winds carrying a lot of dust and during the rains a lot of soil was being carried from the hills into the city and so also too a lot of wat
er we ended up with floods
\par <$A> <#/>Now how many projects have you undergone since then 
\par <$B> <#/><-/>To date we have fourteen projects plus our forest projects and eight village projects 
\par <$A> <#/>I\rquote ve learned that your target is to make sure that Dodoma town is changing }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  from its semi-arid environment to a green belt <#/>Now how much successful }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{
\fs24\lang2057  have you been as far as that is concerned 
\par <$B> <#/>So far we've planted four thousand hectares and we've managed to conserve nine thousand hectares of forest <#/>That's natural forest <#/>Therefore we've a total of thirteen thousand hectares of forest developed <#/>Also in villages we\rquote 
ve succeeded to establish }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  trial plots or rather demonstration plots in eight villages and school woodlots in all these villages 
\par <$A> <#/>Yeah but you've talked of the conserved forest <#/>What do you mean by conserved forest and planting trees <#/>Does it mean that they are two different things 
\par <$B> <#/>Sure <#/>When we have an area which is complet
ely open I mean without any vegetation we have to plant so that we can establish a forest <#/>When an area has a <./>poten <-/>a potentiality of uh being protected up to years to become a forest by its own we call it a conservation project or rather conse
rvation forest 
\par <$A> <#/>I see <#/>Now what has been the people's response towards the whole plan 
\par <$B> <#/>At the beginning the response was negative in a lot of cases because people thought we were just trying to snatch land from their hands for no reason but later or gradually they started accepting but of course up to now it's not a hundred per cen
t because people need land for grazing and other uses so also due to lack of knowledge they don't realise the fact that also trees and other <-_vegetations><+_kinds of vegetation> are important in their environments 
\par <$A> <#/>Now if that is <./>th <-_>if that is<-/> the case uh what do you do to make sure that those people do understand 
\par <$B> <#/>We this is why we have an extension service whereby we visit villages and educate them on the environment and uh actually this has been quite effective 
\par <$A> <#/>Okay <#/>What problems have you been facing 
\par <$B> <#/>Our main problems have been financial and lack of people's participation 
\par <$A> <#/>Now what do
\par <$B> <#/>That means we've had limited funds to carry out the jobs and we've had little participation from people 
\par <$A> <#/>When you say you have little participation from the people and on the other <-_>on the other<-/> hand you said you've got what you call community forests where you <-/>you incorporate people how does it I mean how <-/>how is it possible 
\par <$B>
 <#/>We have projects where we try to utilise people's efforts but so far people have not co-operated so much <#/>What I mean is of course some people have appreciated but we still have a big number of villagers who don't appreciate the project and this i
s why I'm saying we still have a lot of work to do on extension services to ensure that people appreciate the importance of planting trees or rather protecting their own environment 
\par <$A> <#/>In some places when we have people who do not accept such projects we find the problems uh such as that the people would <-/>would set into fire }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\b\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 
the whole place let's say the whole conserved place or the whole <./>plan uh trees which were planted how about Dodoma 
\par <$B> <#/>That is also the case <#/>When people didn't like a project they tried to discourage it and that's why they tried to set fires and so forth but at least my experience is that this problem has gone down }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{
\fs24\lang2057  very much 
\par <$A> <#/>We all understand that environment protection and conservation is the world cry in our time and is the theme of everyone concerned every concerned people now what other projects are you involved in to match <-_with> that 
\par <$B> <#/>Other projects include purely erosion control on areas which are very much exposed to 
the problem and we cut up the job by say construction of check-dams planting of grass and other <-_vegetations><+_kinds of vegetation> which can survive in areas which have been very much destroyed <#/>Also we have pollution control programmes <#/>This is
 
where we involve industrialists in ways that they can control uh their <-_dispose><+_disposal> of residues from their industries and so forth also advisory services to villagers on how to protect their own environment is another project <#/>That makes abo
ut three programmes in addition to tree planting
\par <$A> <#/>In other cities such as Mwanza for example we've got the problem of those industrialists having no plans of uh <-/>of disposing their residues and leftovers from their industries and that <-_bring><+
_brings> us to the problem that they're disposing their waste materials <-_to><+_in> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
 the lake for example Lake <-/>Lake Victoria <#/>Now have you any specific plan or let's say specific area where you have instructed those industrialists to <-/>to dispose their waste
\par <$B> <#/>Sure <#/>For example for liquids we have the main sewer here in this town <#/>We have constructed a sewer which will <-_>which will<-/> transport all chemical residues all liquid <./>resid residues to uh an extension point out
side the city <#/>For <-_solidy><+_solid> residues we have set aside areas where those can be dumped into pits and then covered so that they don't cause much harm to residents of the city 
\par <$A> <#/>Some of the problems in other big cities is }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  th
at they lack proper plans for the development of their cities now and that has caused a lot of problems as far as protection of environment is concerned <#/>Now how have you go }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  about that 
\par <$B> <#/>For us this city is very well planned <#/>We a
ctually have a master plan <#/>Everything has got its own location and it has to be located there <#/>Therefore chances of making mistakes are very few <#/>For example very few cities have got this green belt project or rather uh even not only the green b
e
lt but even this <-/dispose> of uh residues from industries <#/>We find that most of the cities have not got this planned in advance but for us all these have been planned and implementation is according to the plan so there are no dangers or chances that
 we'll have such problems
\par <$A> <#/>Well as far as your explanation is that you have other projects <./>in incorporated in the environment protection and we have mentioned some few now what is your success story of uh those projects 
\par <$B> <#/>As far as }{\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057 
 protection of the environment is concerned I can say there is a lot of success because if one had <-_a><+_the> chance to come to Dodoma some ten or thirteen years ago the situation was really poor <#/>It was as I said plenty of dust }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 
<&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  in the city and so forth but right now the city is green especially for those areas which are planned and the belt has come up very nicely <#/>Of course we had problems but I can say it's quite a good success in general 

\par <$A> <#/>By the way who <-_finance><+_finances> these projects 
\par <$B> <#/>This project is mainly financed by the government but also we have had assistance from several organisations like UNDP WFP <name/> and <name/>
\par <$A> <#/>Now what is your general view <-_over><+_of> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  <-/>over the whole issue 
\par <$B> <#/>My view is that uh the issue of environment is very delicate <#/>The environment is very difficult and expensive to handle but if not protected we have no future <#/>It requires everyone's participation and a great effort to ensure furth
er <#/>People have to understand their environment and sort out better ways of exploiting it without destruction 
\par <$A> <#/>Well and that brings me back to the <-/>to <-/>to my worries <#/>When you've talked of the conserved forests it means that before the
 those forests were conserved those forests were catering for the people the people's needs as far as <-_woods><+_wood> for cooking let's say is concerned or charcoal-making and these <-_>and these<-/> sort of things <#/>Now what alternatives do you give 
those people instead of
\par <$B> <#/>Actually that is why I said we were convinced that it was important to have village forest projects so that we could assist people in planting their own trees so that they can get their own needs from their own land and if y
ou plant trees and take care of them you can use much less land to get enough of the requirements and also it's not only of course you are right it's not only that they were not uh I mean they were using the forest for <-/>for wood products but also for g
r
azing and so forth <#/>So we are also advising them to plant grass and tree species which can be used for as fodder and if you plant your own fodder you use much land <./>al less land also <#/>So even when we've taken so much land for forest people can st
ill get their requirements if they use their remaining pieces of land with wood plants 
\par <$A> <#/>We have learned in this city that there are those problems of uh soil destruction in the sense that people are <-_dugging><+_digging> out soil and some are doin
g that destruction on those planned areas for <-/>for residential use <#/>Now what do you do to <-/>to combat that situation 
\par <$B> <#/>There are several ways of combating the problem <#/>One is by using a bit of force to ensure that people don't get into s
uch areas and the force is exerted by the capital <O/> authority but also the villages have been assisted and they have been encouraged to try as much as possible not to allow people to get into areas which are not set aside for <./>exca excavation of san
d or <?/>marm etcetera <#/>Also we've set aside areas in which we've shown people areas where they can get their requirements and those areas do not pose any danger to our environment 
\par <$A> <#/>Does it <#/>Is it that those sand excavators are individuals or they\rquote re grouped into companies or other groups 
\par <$B> <#/>It's everything individuals companies <#/>All of them want to construct <#/>They want to build houses roads and so forth <#/>So they are all involved in the destruction of the environment
\par <$A> <#/>Now in forest conservation what is mainly involved 
\par <$B> <#/>In forest conservation the main the first thing is to get into an area and make a vegetation survey <#/>The vegetation survey is aimed at ensuring that the area has got desirable species
 If the number of desirable species is high enough to convince a forester that the area thus requires protection then it is conserved <#/>Now by desirable species I mean tree species which are desired regardless of their age valuable tree species in terms
 
of either recreation timber or erosion control or even fodder <#/>After ensuring that uh we've a reasonable number of <./>de desirable trees in the area then we declare it a conservation forest and the area is completely protected no grazing no harvesting
 no fires and any other types of destruction in the forest
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Therefore it's totally protected Then of course the other cultural procedures which can proceed in the forest such as singling This is a process where we reduce the number of trees because in a natu
ral forest sometimes you find that the trees are just too close So to encourage growth of the remaining trees we remove some of them to give them more space so that also they can also get their requirements without much competition In short that is what i
s mainly involved in a conservation forest 
\par <$A> <#/>And in planting how do you carry out your work 
\par <$B> <#/>When an <-/>an area has been put aside for planting the first thing is to remove unwanted vegetation such as <O/> patches and so forth After removi
ng those the second stage is peating and our peats are sixty centimetres by sixty That means sixty centimetres in diameter and sixty centimetres in depth After peating we apply a bit of manure about five litres in every peat That is cow dung manure This m
a
nure is mixed in with the soil which has been <./>exc excavated from the pit and then everything is put back into the pit again Then we have to construct our roads service roads in the forest before planting and during the rains we send the seedlings to t
he site with the trucks and at the beginning of the rains we start planting and of course the planting is done very carefully because the this area is very arid and if the planting is not done carefully you lose up }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{
\v\fs24\lang2057  almost all your trees 
\par <$A> <#/>What do you mean by carefully 
\par <$B> <#/>I mean we are very sensitive in terms of depth of planting and we observe all recommended planting techniques to avoid things like coiling of roots or probably injuring the seedling at planting or maybe putting too mu
ch pressure at planting and so forth Also even the choice of species for planting in this area is a very important thing You have to choose species which can survive the drought here in Dodoma A lot <-_>a lot<-/> of tree species cannot stand the type of c
l
imate we have here It's too harsh so we have to be careful enough to ensure that we choose the species which will survive this harsh climate and also species which have got enough uses say if they whether they could be timber trees could be fodder trees c
o
uld be ornamentals because we are planting around the city and we would like to have these trees used for uses other than timber only so we also choose trees which look nice and if where possible we also choose trees which can retain their leaves even dur
i
ng the dry season Also tree species like <ea/>lukina are used to improve the soil fertility because species like those can fix nitrogen in the soil and considering the poor soil quality in here in Dodoma it's very important also to include such species so
 that we can improve the soil quality 
\par <$A> <#/>Yeah the way you have explained the work it seems so bulky Now who <-_do><+_does> all those works 
\par <$B> <#/>For the capital development projects the work is done by employed labourers and supervised by our forest officers and technicians 
\par <$A> <#/>Now you have also mentioned something on community forestry Now how do you involve villagers or those institutions in such }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article}{\v\fs24\lang2057 > project 
\par <$B> <#/>When we get into a village the first thing is to discuss with th
e leaders to convince them that it's important to plant their own trees and protect their own environment When this is agreed we start with the process of establishing uh a sort of demonstration plot because you know most of our villagers here have never 
d
ealt with tree planting So we have to establish a demonstration plot so that villagers can see how the work is done Usually we use ten hectares So we clear a piece of land We plant trees the way we do in our own projects and villagers come there and work 
T
hey get the experience and during the process we also issue free seedlings to villagers so that they can plant at their own homes along their streets in the village in their farms And schools also in the villages are encouraged to collect seedlings to pla
n
t in their schools Institutions at the same time are involved in planting trees around their institutions and institutions like prisons <name/> I mean <name/> prisons have been doing quite a good job They've planted over fifty hectares now of very nice fo
r
est And in every village we have our extension officer or rather an extension technician who is permanently there checking the trees advising the people full time To make this work possible we have formed a team of experts to advise institutions and villa
g
ers on this subject of environment management and their work is to go to the villages and advise the villagers on all aspects of environment management of course not forgetting aspects like production of their own crops and we mainly deal with fruits and 
vegetables in villages because it is easier to convince villagers }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_to>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  do other things if also they think they can get uh other requirements like food 
\par <$A> <#/>Now what are your soil erosion control techniques 
\par <$B> <#/>Uh we have several techniques of controlling erosion here in our area Those include construction of dams These dams are meant to collect the water which <-_come><+_comes> from the hills so that they don't }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{
\v\fs24\lang2057  cause much erosion further down the slopes We also have these check-dams 
which are much smaller than the dams I talked about These are mainly meant to check the water speed These are established along the gullies so that as the water comes down it <-/>it it's <-/>it's stopped somehow and deposes most of the soil which has been
 
carried from up the hills and part of the water can proceed and is stopped again by another check-dam along the gully and if <-_it's><+_there's> a series of gullies along the I mean a series of <./>da check dams along the <-_>along the<-/> gullies in the 
end we find very little water coming down and very little soil carried by the water}{\fs24\lang2057  </X></I>}{\v\fs24\lang2057

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <I> <$A> <#/>In this edition Leila <?/>Schechashem talks about the Tanzanian Media Woman Association Crisis Centre running every Friday at Magomeni in Dar es Salaam 
\par <$B> <#/>The Centre has been operating for the past two years uh <#
/>We decided that it is uh important to have such a centre and the first of its kind in the country whereby we give uh legal advice we give counselling to victims of domestic and sexual violence <#/>The centre uh opens every day Monday till Friday <#/>Ini
t
ially we used to open on Friday afternoons and then the demand became greater and we decided to open on Monday Wednesday and Friday but now we open from Monday till Friday <#/>There is always a counsellor and a lawyer available at the Centre <#/>But uh ap
a
rt from uh offering legal uh <-/>legal advice and counselling to victims of domestic and sexual violence we also give literature on how to avoid such uh violence for to women and children <#/>For example we have an outreach programme where we go to school
 
and institutions of learning we visit factories and other places of work <#/>We give lectures on uh the issue of violence against women and children and we also distribute a lot of literature and we feel that uh with the increased awareness among the publ
ic on the very issue of violence that is one way of <-/>of containing the problem
\par <$A> <#/>For the first two years that you have been operational what would you say are the key problems that women come up with 
\par <$B> <#/>Uh you see initially when we started 
we were quite uh uh discouraged in the sense that uh most of the cases that we got dealt with inheritance custody and maintenance and we felt that we should not turn them away because that is a form of a problem although primarily the Centre was establish
e
d to help victims of domestic and sexual violence <#/>We felt that okay whoever comes along we're going to help them <#/>That also included victims of drug abuse <#/>That uh <-/>that also included uh victims of AIDS we offered them counselling and advice 
<
#/>But after a lot of publicity and I have to say here that Radio Tanzania played a very big role in helping us to publicise the Centre's work we got uh cases of domestic violence and sexual harassment and sexual abuse started trickling in and uh because 
o
f this raised public awareness that women should not feel ashamed that children should not be made to feel ashamed when such cases happen that they should come forward to get uh medical treatment and to get uh uh counselling and also rehabilitation and to
 
press charges against the assailant <#/>Somehow slowly <-/>slowly the cases started trickling in and in the past year we have been getting a lot more cases dealing <./>excluse exclusively with domestic and sexual violence <#/>And uh you see uh we have uh 
b
ecause the Centre is the first of its kind in the country really we were sort of groping in the dark because we didn't have a blue-print whereby we could operate such a centre but uh we had a lot of literature from other centres in the world for example i
n
 Zimbabwe our sisters there are quite advanced in <-/>in counselling victims of domestic violence and also in <-/>in Western Europe in America and in Asia especially South East Asia <#/>We got a lot of literature from them <#/>We wrote to them letters ask
i
ng them if they could send us their experiences on how to operate such a centre and from that we learned from them and we decided to adapt some of those uh <./>ex experiences to our own environment <#/>And uh as I said before we were groping in the dark i
n
itially but now in the since we started two years ago up to now we have sort of we are beginning to stand on our feet we are becoming more confident and uh we are more able to <-/>to offer help because now we sort of have devised a strategy and <-/>and it
's quite uh <-_>it's quite<-/> effective 
\par <$A> <#/>You told me earlier on that uh you have employed a multi-disciplinary approach to you know dealing with the cases at the Crisis Centre <#/>How do you operate 
\par <$B> <#/>We have uh counsellors uh from various
 uh fields <#/>You see we have experts <#/>For example we have lawyers <#/>We have social workers <#/>We have teachers <#/>We have journalists <#/>We have even <-_housewife><+_housewives> <#/>We have religious organisations different churches and so on uh
 
and all of us have something to offer the Centre <#/>All of us have uh experiences uh All of us have a form of expertise that can help in mobilising the <-/>the <-/>the public <#/>And uh each one of us contributes something <#/>For example you and I are j
o
urnalists we both we're both uh counsellors in the Centre and our help has been in giving information in uh <-/>in designing in editing in <-/>in putting down putting up the pamphlets that are part of the literature in the programme <#/>The others the soc
i
al workers for example they give counselling and rehabilitation <#/>The lawyers give legal advice <#/>The doctors come in they <-/>they help us with medical advice and so on <#/>So each one of us contributes something and uh uh what uh <-/>what uh <-/>wha
t
 has uh come up is that uh we have evolved this kind of team spirit you see among ourselves <#/>For example I co-ordinate the Centre but uh I'm not really a boss in the sense that I don't sort of give orders like uh this is what <-/>what should be done <#
/
>We always have good meetings <#/>We have a kind of group therapy which helps us a lot because counselling is very hard work <#/>Counselling requires a lot of concentration if <#/>We have to give up a lot of ourselves in counselling <#/>Sometimes our temp
e
rs become frayed <#/>Sometimes we <-/>we become nervous so we decided that we have to have a group work therapy and we decided that it is important to have a group therapy every month or at least every six weeks where we counsel ourselves and we <-/>we le
arn from each other and also to let off steam <#/>That helps a lot 
\par <$A> <#/>Someone might wonder where you get the time to do this kind of thing because I think the majority of you have your own salaried jobs <-_isn't it><+_don't you> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar/tag}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$B> 
<#/>Yes uh we all have uh we're all employed elsewhere <#/>For example I <-/>I edit a magazine <#/>I also do edit books <#/>There are some of us who work in <-/>in newspapers <#/>Some of us work in the <?/>Tanzananical Corporation <#/>Some of us work in d
i
fferent places teachers and so on <#/>Uh You see counselling is not a paying job because it <-/>it doesn't pay in terms of uh monetary value <#/>You <-/>you don't get <./>an you don't get much out of it <#/>If anything the stipend that one gets just barel
y
 covers the <-/>the transport to and from the Centre <#/>But we get <-_>we get<-/> a lot of satisfaction we get a lot of uh uh a feeling of achievement from having <-/>having helped people and also it helps us in the process because when we counsel <-_>we
 
counsel<-/> the <-/>the <-/>the clients who come there in the process we also exercise our own fears we also exercise our own nervousness our own inadequacies and it helps us a lot that way <#/>So as I said uh counselling pays emotionally it pays morally 
but not in <-/>in monetary form no it doesn't 
\par <$A> <#/>And in terms of uh uh maybe success stories would you be in a position perhaps to pinpoint one case or two that you thought was really outstanding in which uh the Crisis Centre emerged successful
\par <$B> <#/>Yes uh there are two kinds of successes here that I <-/>I think I should say that <#/>The first kind is where a woman whose uh <-/>whose husband was battering her and uh he was battering her all the time and she came to see us and we asked us we 
a
sked her whether she wanted to press charges in court whether she wanted to sue for compensation or whether she wanted a divorce and she said no that she was still in love with her husband and we felt that okay this marriage can be salvaged <#/>We <-/>we 
<
-/>we can offer counselling to the husband as well because batterers are also victims in their own way <#/>We called the husband forward and he came thank God he came there and we counselled him and we <-/>we went back to the root cause of the problem and
 
we discovered that his mother was also battered by his father and he thought that this is a way of life this is how husbands live with their wives and we tried to tell him that this is not how people live and slowly over <-/>over a period of time he came 
t
o accept that battering is bad and he was ready to reform <#/>So we felt that they had to come for <./>counsel <-/>for more counselling in the Centre but I think their marriage survived and I think they're quite happy now <#/>That is one success story <#/
>
The other success story is success in a perverse way because this girl got raped <#/>So I mean when you talk about success you can't say that this is a happy story <#/>It's a sad story but success in the sense that we got the <-/>the assailant the perpetr
a
tor of the crime to be imprisoned for seventeen years and thirty lashings and also to pay compensation to the girl <#/>But that was not success for us as much as when the girl because initially she was quite scared to go out on her own to go <-_>to go<-/>
 
on public transport because she felt that this could happen again you see the <-/>the abuse <#/>We counselled her and over a period of time she could come from her home in the district to the Centre on her own without uh somebody accompanying her <#/>But 
later on what made us very happy was the fact that she decided to go for further studies away from Dar es Salaam where she can go <-_in><+_to> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
 a teacher training college <#/>And I think uh that is success in a way
\par <$A> <#/>Would you say Leila such cases of rape uh are rampant say in Dar es Salaam or in the country general
\par <$B> <#/>You see uh rape doesn't have a particular face or a sexual harasser or a rapist doesn't have a particular face like he has a horn on his head or he has uh he's <-/>he's go
t blue skin or <#/>No any <-/>any good-looking smart intelligent educated man can be a rapist and those men who are sort of low income group dirty or <./>the they probably respect women and they take care of women and they know that rape is bad so he it d
o
esn't have a blue-print like you can tell your children or you can tell your sisters don't <-/>don't <-/>don't talk to such a person because he <-/>he could he is a rapist <#/>No he doesn't have a face <#/>What we discovered in our research and also from 
our work in the Centre is that uh <-/>that some girls or some women got raped by neighbours people they trusted or even by }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057 
 brother-in-law or by <-/>by an uncle people they trusted people that their parents would entrust them with <#/>Or you find
 that you'll find a stranger somebody who's far away from the family somebody you don't know probably he will come forward and help you <#/>So a rapist doesn't have a particular face <#/>What we what I always try to tell young girls and also women is to s
a
y that try not to walk in dark places try not to stay in the house on your own with a stranger or even if you feel that a person is becoming uh offensive put up a struggle or shout or get away from the house <#/>And also to small children we always tell t
h
em that uh you know like we have in our African society we're told that you have to respect your elders <#/>Whatever they tell you to do you have to do like you can send somebody somebody's child to the shop send somebody's child to the market It's accept
ed <#/>Sometimes we keep telling the parents that you be careful <#/>Tell your children to <-/>to respect elders but at the same time not to be too trusting <#/>So quite often we find that those children who have been abused it's by people they know

\par <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 They're
 people they trust They're called into the house or they're told come with me to the shop and then after it happens the <-/>the parents start crying and say if only we knew this man is somebody we trusted So we have to be careful all the time We're walkin
g
 a tight rope really You know like you can't say you <-/>you can't isolate your child all the time because that won't be healthy At the same time you can't give him too much freedom because that also would be unhealthy So all the time we have to devise st
rategies on how to deal with the issue like move with the tide I know it's difficult but somehow we have to find a way of coping with this problem

adio Tanzania
\par <$B> <#/>Thank you
\par <$A> <#/>Dr Kapiga you are a medical doctor at the University College of Health Sciences Muhimbili Dar es Salaam <#/>Maybe to begin with can you tell us a little bit more about yourself and the type of work that you do
\par <$B> 
<#/>Thank you Mr Tesha <#/>I am I lecture in the Department of Epidimiology at uh Muhimbili University College uh I<#/>'m teaching epidimiology which is mainly a study of uh methods and uh uh approaches which are used in investigation of diseases identifi
cation of risk factors and uh general principles of disease uh control
\par <$A> <#/>That is in as far as the type of work you are doing is concerned but how about yourself
\par <$B> <#/>Uh myself uh I am I started working at Muhimbili in nineteen eighty-seven and uh
 you know apart from my teaching I'm also working with the Ministry of Health uh in several activities related to family planning uh and you know mainly research but also dissemination of research findings
\par <$A> <#/>How did it come that you became interested in this particular field of work 
\par <$B> <#/>Uh well my interest dates back to the medical school days yah you know I became in general interested in reproductive health and family planning is obviously one of the key reproductive health issues and obvious
ly uh you know having gone through the courses seeing the population problems and the role which family planning could play uh I became interested to work }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  in this field
\par <$A> <#/>Dr Kapiga you are saying you are uh doing something relating to family planning services here in Tanzania <#/>What does this specifically entail
\par <$B> <#/>Uh there are several things I have done but probably the <-/>the most relevant for <-/>for this purpose is that uh the Ministry of Health and uh the Bureau of Statistic
s and uh the planning uh the population planning unit within the planning commission and Muhimbili Medical Centre they developed a sort of a presentation which uh shows uh population problems in the country and also it shows uh you know family planning us
e
 and some of the problems which are associated with uh particularly low family planning use and uh the idea is we are trying to generate uh uh we are using information generated in Tanzania to try to sensitise especially people as policy makers and the ot
her people who may facilitate uh uh who may give a helping hand in trying to raise uh family planning use uh in Tanzania
\par <$A> <#/>For <-/>for how long has uh this particular project been in existence and uh would you say you are making any success at all 
\par <
$B> <#/>uh this project uh is supported by RAPID project which is uh based in uh North Carolina and the US and uh receives funds from US-AID and it started last year <#/>What was done was to put together information from different sources from different r
e
search findings and uh making sense out of this uh information <#/>Most information as you know generated from research is you know presented in scientific fora and is not really uh in usable form for policy makers and other people <#/>So this attempt tri
e
s to bring this information in a much easier way uh which can be understood by people at policy level and hopefully we'll generate their interest and their participation in uh <./>r raising awareness and also promoting uh use of family planning methods <#
/>We have started the presentations about two months ago }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  uh although we have been less successful in uh making many presentations because uh you know we are not uh getting uh many information }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  about meetings which are happening <#/>So
 far we have made a presentation to the Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Health uh <#/>We also made a presentation to the uh uh Association of Statisticians the Bureau of Statistics and uh there are several planned sort of dissemination uh meetings 
which are planned in the near future
\par <$A> <#/>Well if you travel across Tanzania you will come a number you will come across a number of uh areas large areas that are uninhabited and this is the situation in quite a number of the other developing countries 
<#/>Now if this is the case if that is the case why should uh uh your project uh concentrate on uh this issue of family planning in a place like Tanzania when we know that we have areas which are large areas which are uninhabited
\par <$B> <#/>Yes that's a good
 question uh uh <#/>I think it's not the question of land uh that here you have land which is uninhabited uh <#/>I think it's more or less the issue of you know balance between resources and people you have uh <#/>Obviously we have a vast land but when yo
u
 look in terms of actual resources which are available obviously uh you know we have a serious stress in our you know economic capability to support this large sort of population so that is one aspect uh you know serious threat in the population and gross
 
imbalance uh between uh what the economy can support and what uh numbers you have in terms of people <#/>But there are also other uh health uh rationale for family planning uh you know high births uh you know many births which are not spaced are known to 
p
ose a high risk uh health condition among both the mother the family and also the babies who are born uh <#/>We know for example babies who are born very close uh together especially who are born within uh less than two year period from the previous birth
 
they are more likely to die uh <#/>We also know women who get their first babies uh you know at early age maybe before eighteen nineteen years they are also more likely to suffer pregnancy complications uh and so forth <#/>So these are some of the rationa
le uh for family planning use and if I just quote some figures here you know the <-/>the our population at alarming speed you know it was seven point seven million people in nineteen forty-eight 
\par <$A> <#/>the population in Tanzania 
\par <$B> <#/>Yes when the fi
rst census was uh done and this came to twelve point three million in nineteen sixty-seven and in the last census nineteen eighty-eight it was twenty-three point one million <#/>So you know our population has tripled in the last forty years
\par <$A> <#/>Could you also tell us about uh the people that you intend to pass this message to <#/>Whom are you targeting at}{\b\fs24\lang2057  }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$B> <#/>Yes uh you know traditionally most messages <-_has><+_have> been directed to potential clients of family planning you know women uh
 attending a service somewhere <#/>You know they are given messages about family planning and the other people who are potential clients and we have evidence that awareness among people in general has increased uh <#/>But we feel people who can make thing
s
 happen you know people who are in policy makers' position uh you know who can like say we need more contraceptives and they can take necessary actions to order more contraceptives or people who can say we need more messages disseminated to people or we n
e
ed this kind of resources uh <#/>We found these people are least informed and uh maybe this is one reason why they are not really participating to the level which we want them to participate <#/>So we thought why don't we target this level you know make m
e
ssages which are easily understood uh which can be presented in like thirty minutes <#/>These people are busy so like thirty minutes presentation and maybe ten minutes of discussion and hope at the end of that we'll generate their support and also their i
nterest in this uh field <#/>So it's really we appreciate these are the people who can make things happen and we feel it\rquote s important that they are also drawn in as uh partners in this effort
\par <$A> <#/>Now if you are targeting at }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  the Government bureaucracy the decision makers where is the ordinary man left 
\par <$B> <#/>Uh we have uh of course several activities within the Ministry of Health and I'm aware other ministries like uh women development uh <#/>We have you know ongoing uh in
formation education communication messages which are going on to these people and in fact they've been successful uh you know you ask people they tell you we know pills we know condoms we know uh whatever <#/>But uh we <-/>we feel that this other part the
se senior officials in different positions are probably less informed and we have assumed that they know but uh we feel that we need to give them more information and we need them to be more actively involved than they are at this stage 
\par <$A> <#/>Are you then saying that the situation is improving
\par <$B> <#/>uh Well I <-/>I would say no because uh you know in general we have found awareness is high <#/>You ask people they say yes we know pills we know condoms and so forth but when you ask th
em in detail how does a pill work how do you use a pill how does a pill prevent pregnancy and the other things you find there uh there are obviously serious gaps in knowledge <#/>So that is one aspect <#/>The other aspect is uh use of family planning is s
till low <#/>We have uh you know }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057 
 national average of about six per cent use of modern contraceptives and when you combine with uh traditional methods it's about ten per cent you know these ten per cent of women in reproductive age and obviously this is }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{
\fs24\lang2057  very low rate so I think the situation is not improving and in fact the situation requires uh immediate uh effort to try to raise uh family planning use in Tanzania
\par <$A> <#/>Thank you uh <#/>In order to be understood in order to achieve
 your objective there has to be some effective way of uh communicating uh between the project and uh those it aims at for example the decision makers the Government bureaucracy <#/>Now how do you get your messages across 
\par <$B> <#/>Uh we are planning to use
 uh you know method of presentation <#/>We have prepared a briefing booklet which summarises the messages we are trying to put across but also we'll need like thirty minutes presentation <#/>We'll make the presentation and there are two types of presentat
ions}{\b\fs24\lang2057  }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  <#/>One is a presentation which gives an overview of family planning in Tanzania and uh you know this uh in general it describes }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057 
 history of family planning uh and then it describes why family planning is important uh the current
 use of family planning and why the current use is low and then it ends with some suggestions for potential strategies which can be used to raise family planning use <#/>Uh the second presentation which is the RAPID model presentation uh this is uh really
 
looking at population and development so it's looking at population and its relationship to the economy and to the other indices of development <#/>So those are two presentations <#/>They are all <#/>We are going to use slides or we going to use computers
 
uh and you know uh projection material <#/>So those are the modes of presentation and we hope at the end of each presentation we'll have uh some few minutes to discuss and to uh you know raise some questions which you know we hope we will respond or you k
now the audience will uh participate in responding
\par <$A> <#/>Now apart from the two presentations you're talking about how about the uh seminars for instance face-to-face contact <#/>Don't you also use these types to get your messages across 
\par <$B> <#/>Yah ye
s you are right we are going to use these uh <#/>You know we have two approaches one is we'll actively see the possibilities of arranging like seminars workshops <#/>In fact one of the things we feel we need like uh seminar one day seminar for you know pe
ople who are working in the news media radio you know newspapers and so forth uh and you know we hope to arrange these meetings to other types of groups but the other approach is uh you know what uh we call }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{
\fs24\lang2057  opportunistic approach <#/>We'll try to utilise existing meetings so if there is an existing meeting we ask the organisers if we'll have }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 like thirty minutes within their programme and we make the presentation and so forth <#/>But also the presentation will take a form of one to one
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 You know we <-/>we may seek an appointment with the Principal Secretary as uh we did with Mr Shirima You know we went into his office and we had thirty minutes uh presentation and discussion 
\par <$A> <#/>in the Ministry of Health
\par <$B> <#/>Yes in the Ministry of Health
\par <$A> <#/>Now looking at uh available figures one observes that family planning tends to be low in our developing countries Tanzania included Now judging from the research you have been carrying <-/>carrying out for sometime are there any specifi
c reasons for that Why is uh current use of family planning low particularly in the developing counties 
\par <$B> <#/>Well several potential reasons may be advanced uh uh You know uh you are right use is low and there are several things One is uh uh in our societies uh in Tanzanian particularly there are still desire }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{
\v\fs24\lang2057  for large families people still uh you know want large families and obviously for several reasons people feel secure they have four five children and uh this is one reason why use is lo
w In fact in <-/>in <-/>in the surveys which have been done in Tanzania it seems over fifty per cent of women who were interviewed they prefer to have five children or above uh So that's one problem we have in general uh you know desire for large families
 
The other problem is uh you know there are serious misconceptions about family planning uh People think you know they promote promiscuity uh People think they may make somebody infertile so you know they question the reversibility of fertility after you s
top using them uh You know people associate contraceptives with many health risks which we know you know professionally that they}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057  <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 are not real risks And also we know that there are also problems with our service delivery points dispensaries heal
th centres Sometimes uh you know the attitude of people working in the dispensaries may uh make other people not willing to go to get the services Sometimes the services are not easily available They are at long distance }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{
\v\fs24\lang2057  and people you know the
y don't get opportunity to <-/>to reach those services and uh there are also other things timing uh You know most services are given in the morning and you know most people especially in urban areas they are at work and uh you know they come back at work 
}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  in the evening and the clinics are closed So these are some of the things which uh contribute to the low uh contraceptive use in our set-up
\par <$A> <#/>And now how do you react to such claims for instance you have uh those people who will equate uh family planning with abortion or impotence etcetera What is your reaction to people of this type 
\par <$B> <#/>Uh I think in <-/>in general the reaction is you know to <-/>to try to address this by talking to these people and uh you know using existing exampl
es You see you know in certain localities somebody might have been using contraceptives for the last four five years and they go on giving birth and these may be examples you use to convince people that in fact these are not true But uh uh we have found e
s
pecially in Kilimanjaro Region uh where prevalence is very high in fact it's about twenty-five per cent uh It's the highest in Tanzania We have found that uh you know sending messages which are individualised uh you know discussing with a potential client
 
one to one and understanding what sort of problems they have and uh addressing those problems or those needs which they have uh also makes them more confident and also makes them more interested in the service So probably the messages should be individual
ised Uh you know giving broad messages uh you know to everybody you may be giving messages which are not appropriate to }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 certain person within that broad uh group and you know this has worked in Kilimanjaro
\par <$A> <#/>And so in order to do uh the t
ype of things you are talking about you need to have uh competent people <-/>people who <-/>who know exactly what family planning is all about now uh can you tell us something about the nature the type of uh manpower you have in this particular project 

\par <$
B> <#/>Uh well this project itself has no manpower but obviously we are uh inputting in the family planning programme within the Ministry of Health and you know within the Ministry of Health family planning services are provided as part of the comprehensi
v
e maternal and child health services and you know we have uh MCH aids who are trained among other things in family planning uh skills but we have experience in several regions now that uh you know you may take people who are not necessarily nurses people 
w
ho had some sort of formal education and give them orientation and use them to move within communities and provide services uh So you are right that you need some kind of training but this training is not necessarily that you need to go to three four year
s it may be one month two months and people provide services quite well And uh in general <./>con most contraceptives are safe so uh you know sometimes people are worried that you need somebody who is a doctor or somebody who is uh trained for many years 
}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057  to administer these They are fairly safe and uh you know people can distribute them with fairly minimum sort of uh instructions
\par <$A> <#/>You have a country like Tanzania with uh there is this problem of lack of uh an effective uh family planning system How has this uh affected the overall national development of uh Tanzania 
\par <$B> <#/>Well uh that is difficult to <-/>to <-/>to answer but obviously uh we have several facts which indicate that lack of family planning effective family planning service
s use in Tanzania has serious negative uh consequences uh We see population growth uh You know population has increased from seven point seven million in nineteen forty-seven and now it's about twenty-three million and obviously the key determinant of inc
r
ease in population is fertility and uh we know in Tanzania on average a woman bears about seven children you know throughout her reproductive period uh which uh is the highest in the world and uh we know evidence from other countries that family planning 
uh is a most direct way to lower fertility and obviously uh to lower uh you know population growth }{\fs24\lang2057 </X></I>

k that }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  we'll have the second and last part in two programmes in a series on leprosy this week Dr <name/> will go on explaining on how leprosy is cured the symptoms of the disease the incubation period of }

 leprosy victims and who are the most affected with <-_the> leprosy <#/>She is beginning her explanations on ways to cure leprosy
\par <$B> <#/>Uh yes If you remember my previous statement I said in former years people didn't know uh if 
at all leprosy was curable because most of them they ended up mutilated <#/>But as a matter of fact as science went on uh the <?/>siphons were discovered so the patients were treated by <?/>Datson <#/>Now with the <-/>the treatment of <?/>Datson this is s
a
id to be a monotherapy when we say when I say monotherapy it's only one drug <#/>And one drug usually is not uh so efficient so the microbacterial lepry might develop <#/>Now how come the resistance <#/>A patient himself can be lazy because of the irregul
a
rity of intake of the tablets or the drugs Now by doing so uh the <./>bac uh the bacilli develop resistance <#/>Now the efforts of uh the <./>W WHO and other <./>scienti scientists they discovered other drugs which are more potent because we know that if 
you treat a case uh with two or more drugs uh the probability of the bacilli to develop }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 resistance is almost negligible <#/>So nowadays the patients are being treated with multi-drug-therapy and this multi-drug-therapy in Tanzania is uh iso-prot
ein with uh <O/> <#/>And in those days when they were being treated <./>wi with uh <?/>Datson the duration was too long and so many of them they }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  just dropped out and then they lost uh faith <-_on><+_in> }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  the treatment and they said that
 well they don't feel see any difference in their body but then through that uh the criteria of the bacilli developing resistance and also many patients dropping out so it was decided to use the multi-drug-therapy <#/>Uh the multi-drug-therapy reduces als
o the period of treatment <#/>In former years the post-bacillary cases took three years to five to be cured and the multi-bacillary cases uh took uh three years to fifteen that's }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057 
 lifetime <#/>But with the <./>mult uh multi-drug-therapy for the p
ost-bacillary cases it's only six months if the patient is regular and also uh twenty-four months that's two years with the multi-bacillary case if also one is regular with the intake of the drugs <#/>So we say that there's <-_a> very good progress in the
 management of leprosy <#/>So leprosy is curable <#/>Leprosy is not to be feared anymore
\par <$A> <#/>What <-_are><+_is> the incubational period of the virus of leprosy
\par <$B> <#/>Uh the incubation period of this bacilli or I mean the incubation period of this di
sease uh is rather an a controversy <#/>You see we can say six months to forty years or six years to thirty you know it varies <#/>So there hasn't been a <-_really><+_real> demarcation of saying this is an incubation period of leprosy <#/>So leprosy is st
ill uh difficult if you take it on that side of the incubation period because we don't have any vaccine to test uh and also we really don't know when one has the bacilli until the time the disease comes out
\par <$A> <#/>Dr <name/> can you tell me what are the consequences for a victim of leprosy
\par <$B> <#/>Uh Thank you very much <#/>You know the consequences of this disease is terrible <#/>It's only the consequences that make people build up the uh <-/>the stigma and with the association we are trying to remove th
at stigma <#/>Now uh the consequences of a badly managed case or a case which hides away and doesn't come for <-_the> help is disability <#/>When I say disability it's an area of the body uh being impaired <-_of><+_in> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{
\fs24\lang2057  its normal activities uh for
 example if one has got leprosy and doesn't come for uh to the hospital one will have the nerve damaged and then there's paralysis of that part of the body and if at all one doesn't turn up for uh help then that paralysis from being soft to will stiffened
 up <#/>So actually it's the disability which comes out as a bad consequence of this disease
\par <$A> <#/>Thank you very much Doctor <name/> <#/>Well we've just marked the World Leprosy Day very recently and why efforts has failed }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  to eradicate or to
 overcome the disease worldwide <#/>You being the vice chairperson of Tanzania Leprosy Association you can have a word or two on this }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>style}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$B> <#/>Well thank you very much <#/>Uh I think I'll talk more on Tanzania <#/>Uh as being a chair a vice chair
person of the Tanzania Leprosy Association I would say that Tanzania has set a pace forward because uh the number of cases which were being catered }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_for>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
 since the start of this programme in nineteen seventy-seven until now it's really uh we are
 very optimistic that the disease will one day be eradicated because from thirty-five thousand cases in nineteen-eighty-three to three thousand four hundred in nineteen ninety-three it's very encouraging <#/>So with this we haven't put our tools down <#/>
W
e are really working hard on it to try to see if at all we can uh fish out those who are still hiding out to treat them because it's through this way through the radios pamphlets and uh meetings that uh the health education can reach those who are really 
out <./>o of the city centre to come out and get treated <#/>So at least as I say with Tanzania that uh the progress is good as compared to the figures which I've just aired out }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$A> <#/>Dr <name/> we've been dealing with uh leprous cases for quite a long time <#/>Now d'you think who are the most affected }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  with the leprosy
\par <$B> <#/>Leprosy doesn't really choose <#/>Leprosy is a disease of man <#/>Leprosy affects the young and the old the rich and the poor a male and a female <#/>So it doesn't choose really
\par <$A> <#/>Doctor being a chairperson of Tanzania Leprosy Association what activities you've been doing }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  until now
\par <$B> <#/>Uh there are several activities which I've been doing <#/>The first and foremost for the Tanzania Leprosy Association is health education <-_to><+_of> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
 the public because we know that once the people get to know what is leprosy }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  they'll be in the position to present them
selves early to the health facilities for diagnosis and proper treatment <#/>And with our modern drugs we have already succeeded to treat }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 so many cases of leprosy that's why the number of cases have gone down <#/>There's a real good and clear decline of leprosy in Tanzania <#/>Uh now with that we haven't really uh we haven't stopped to give }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 more efforts to this <#/>Now we are trying to strengthen health education <-_to><+_of> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  the people because we wouldn't like to see anybody being uh disabled by leprosy
\par <$A> <#/>Thank you <./>mu very much Dr <name/> <#/>Now for a conclusion do you have any call to our listeners or the <./>pal I mean those who affected with the leprosy
\par <$B> <#/>Uh yes <#/>The community should be prepared to <
-/>to live with our leprous patients or to live with uh the patients who have been affected by leprosy <#/>When I say this when we live we stay with our patients or with our relatives who have been affected by leprosy one we can encourage them to take the
i
r drugs two we can share the love between us and third it will help them to <-/>to be good uh symbols of good uh examples to the others that I suffered from leprosy at one time but now I'm cured <#/>That is <-_a> pride because one has stayed <./>with with
in the community and got cured within it <#/>In other words I say that we shouldn't segregate patients leprous patients <#/>Uh another thing which I'm going to make it }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 uh clear is that leprosy is no longer to be feared because we've got very eff
icient drugs and they're available <#/>So it's a matter of those who listen and who <-/>who are aware of the uh <-/>the existing problem of leprosy to come forward for examination and then if they are confirmed to have }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{
\fs24\lang2057  the disease to be treated fully

the one which is considered to be uh anaemia
\par <$B> <#/>Uh you have mentioned the two technical names and these are haemoglobin and haematrocrit What are these words
\par <$A> <#/>Haemoglobin uh is a chemical substance which uh is protein in nature uh found in red blood cells and uh it is uh mainly concerned with the transport of oxygen in the blood <#/>While haematrocrit uh in simple <-_term><+_terms> is uh }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  percentage of blood which is uh red blood cells because we know that blood is made up of uh two 
major components the plasma and uh red blood cells with other blood cells but haematrocrit in short is the percentage or is the part of the blood which is covered or which constitute is constituted by RBC red blood cells
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 <$B> <#/>Now what are the causes of uh anaemia
\par <$A> <#/>Well there are many causes of anaemia but uh in short we can divide them into three to four groups <#/>The first group is uh due to decreased red cell production and uh examples of this uh can occur in uh failure of haemoglobin synthes
is uh and this <-_include><+_includes> iron <-_deficience><+_deficiency> <?/>talasemia <./>si <?/>sideroplastic uh anaemia and the anaemia of chronic diseases <#/>Another group uh in is the failure of DNA synthesis and uh the anaemia due to this uh }{

\par <$B> <#/>You have mentioned some two words that are also technical <#/>The first one is DNA and the second one is <?/>folit <#/>Now can you try to simplify these words to our listeners
\par <$A> <#/>Well DNA is a short term of the uh name deoxyribo-nucleic acid <#/>Deoxyribo-nucleic acid is a chemical substance uh which is found uh uh in the <-_>in the<-/> cells in particular in the nucleus and uh it is responsible uh <-_in><+_for> }{

also known as folic acid is uh one of the important vitamins which are responsible in the maturation of red blood cells
\par <$B> <#/>Now back to the causes of uh anaemia as have been mentioned you mentioned now only two <#/>What is the third cause
\par <$A> <#/>The
 third cause of anaemia uh is bone marrow <./>fair failure or replacement and this can occur in <O/> like <O/> anaemia infiltration due to leukaemia <./>mi miloma <?/>deforma <?/>casnoma or <?/>milhibrosis The fourth type of uh or <-_>the fourth type of<-

cy> anaemia and also infections like malaria can uh also uh cause anaemia}{\fs24\lang2057 </X>
\par <$B> <#/>What are the symptoms of a person who is having }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  anaemia
\par <$A> <#/>Well there are many symptoms of anaemia and these include uh easy <-/fatigability> and this means that the individual get }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 tired very easily and uh they have difficulty in breathing especially when they have uh reached the point of card
iac <./>fail failure <#/>They also have palpitations <#/>Sometimes they have chest pain which we call angina and uh also they have intermittent<O/> fainting and uh lastly swelling of the limbs especially the lower limbs
\par <$B> <#/>What is your main concern in case of uh anaemia Doctor Kitenge
\par <$A> <#/>Uh Well uh our concern as a physiologist uh is uh uh <./>st <./>s we are trying to study uh what are the physical changes which <-_takes><+_take> place in this patient with anaemia uh In patients with anaemia we
 have two major problems <#/>One is the reduction of oxygen load and the second one reduction of oxygen reserve <#/>The these two problems lead <-_into><+_to> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
 the inability of the blood to supply adequate oxygen in the tissues In normal individual
 adults the oxygen load to the tissues is about one litre per <-_minutes><+_minute> <#/>Uh but oxygen consumption uh is uh about two fifty mills per <-_minutes><+_minute> <#/>And therefore we have uh about uh seven fifty mills of reserve which we call oxy
g
en reserve <#/>This is the <-/>the <-/>the oxygen which is not utilised by the tissue per <-_minutes><+_minute> <#/>In anaemia the oxygen load is less than normal but the consumption remains the same <#/>And hence the reserve volume is reduced <#/>Therefo
r
e an individual will have less oxygen for exercise <#/>And therefore symptoms of anaemia occur when this individual is subjected to exertion <#/>In fact the cells become hypoxic when the haemoglobin concentration <-_fall><+_falls> below fifty per cent of 
t
he normal <#/>What are the <O/> for adaptation in anaemia <#/>Uh If an individual is subjected to a reduced oxygen load let's say by fifty per cent suddenly he will have a cerebral depression and cardiac disfunction <#/>But the individual with fifty per c
ent with the same fifty per cent chronic reduced oxygen load uh will have low cerebral disfunction or cardiac malfunction <#/>This difference I mean this difference is because of the compensatory mechanisms which <-_takes><+_take> place in }{

Individual with anaemia the cardiac output is increased because of vast <-_>dilatation<+_dilation> uh and also because of the uh reduced <./>visco blood viscosity <#/>The <-_>dilatation<+_dilation> uh is uh the result of uh
 oxygen uh <-_deficience><+_deficiency> in the tissues <#/>There is a <-_tendence><+_tendency> that when there is <-_a> low oxygen in the tissue the blood vessels in this particular tissue uh dilate and this is the one of <-_theory><+_theories> which is c

\par }{\fs24 <$A> <#/>It' time once again when }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  we invite you to another programme of Women's Half-Hour <#/>Today Dr Augustin Mas
awe lactation management consultant at the Muhimbili Medical Centre talks about breast-feeding <#/>He is being interviewed by Radio Tanzania's <name/> <#/>First he outlines the advantages of breast-feeding for children
\par <$B> <#/>One of the advantages which is well-known to all of us is that the best milk from the mother provides the <-/>the <-/>the best nutrient for a child during the first <./>si four months of life up to six months of life and mothers uh who have been 
a
ble to adhere to this their babies grow very well without adding anything to the milk things like uh glucose or water or honey and so on so that the other advantage is that <./>is uh for the child survival <#/>It is known that uh babies who are breast-fed
 
on mothers' milk they have got uh a protective effect against main infections including diarrhoea which for <./>exam which is the main killer of our children in this country and uh there are other <./>di infections like acute respiratory tract infection <
.
/>uri urinary tract infection <O/> all these are very common during <-/>during childhood and it has been known that uh even diseases like asthma uh eczema and uh uh uh rhinitis allergy are common in babies who have not been breast-fed during this period <
#/>Uh the other advantage is that we know that <-_baby><+_babies> they grow better }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 and they're <-/>they not only physically but they are mentally more intelligent <#/>Their the uh <-/>the mother provides a <-/>a very strong bonding and this bond
ing is <-/>is both an emotional bonding psycho-social bonding which is very important for the child's survival not only when he's young but uh to <-/>to <-/>to an adult <#/>Uh the other advantage of <-/>of breast-feeding in <-/>in these children is that u
h
 they even the dental development the jaws and so on disease of <-/>of the teeth they are less in babies whose mothers have been breast-feeding <#/>Studies done in developing countries and even in developed countries have <./>show surely indicated that uh
 
breast-feeding does protect a lot of the malnutrition <#/>Uh children who are not breast-fed they <-/>they are not well nourished and uh this is uh very important particularly when you know in this country uh a lot of children are malnourished during the 
f
irst two years of life and if the babies are breast-fed uh this milk provides not only the good growth of the child but also gives nutrients uh things like uh uh vitamin A are very important in breast milk and also uh other trace elements which are found 
in breast milk and <-/>and this provides better nutrient for the child and also better survival for this particular child
\par <$A> <#/>What about bottle feeding <#/>Does it have any effect <-_to><+_on> }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24  the baby
\par <$B> <#/>Oh yes bottle-feeding has got a 
lot of adverse effects in <-/>in <-/>in children in fact uh uh the uh <-/>the uh if you have read the literature on <-/>on <-/>on the history of bottle feeding uh Cecil Williams who is an expert on <-/>on bottle feeding from Australia uh clearly indicated
 
about fifty years ago that bottle is a great killer and we have found out in <./>develop <-/>in developing countries children who have been having bottle-fed uh when they are supposed to be breast-feeding they have uh adverse effects like they get <./>eas
 
<./>dis diarrhoea uh they get uh uh infections and also they don't grow well <#/>One of the uh disadvantages of bottle feeding is the economics of bottle feeding <#/>Children who are bottle-fed uh the parents have got to incur a lot of expenses to buy mil
k from the shop <#/>A child when he is having }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 diarrhoea or acute respiratory tract infection this child is admitted in <-_hostel><+_hospital> <#/>Parents have <./>go especially nowadays of cost sharing parents have got to buy medicine and the mo
thers have got to spend nights and days in <-_hostel><+_hospital> and this uh disturbs a lot of the economy of the family <#/>We know very well the money is going to spend }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 on the treatment of this child and uh it involves the government and the
 society uh in <-_>in in<-/> disturbing the economy <#/>The other problem which we know in bottle-feeding is that uh uh the mothers uh who have been bottle <./>feed feeding these children they don't again go back to <-/>to <-/>to <-/>to breast-feed their 
children which actually results <-_to><+_in> }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24  malnutrition and which is a big killer in this country
\par <$A> <#/>For how long a mother should breast her baby }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
\par <$B> <#/>Well uh it is recommended that a mother should breast-feed her baby exclusively that we stress that exclusive breast-feeding during the first four and six months <#/>There are babies who can get very enough milk }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 even up to six month without adding anything to the baby but we know that uh uh babies can be uh get accu
stomed slowly when they are already four months of age to the locally made available food-stuff at home like <ea/>uji in some uh or any type of cereal which the baby can get at home the uh and the baby should continue breast-feeding after starting the com
plementation and it's strongly recommended to continue up to two years or even beyond
\par <$A> <#/>Dr Masawe there is another problem that uh some mothers in this country or elsewhere in this world breast-feed their babies sometimes only three months and thereafter nothing is coming out <#/>What do we do to such women
\par <$B> <#/>That's a very good question uh <#/>This uh problem of the mothers stop breast-feeding }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  at uh around three months or even earlier there are some mothers even who breast-feed and 
after about one month they say they have not enough milk <#/>Well there are a lot of reasons uh which are <-_>which are<-/> due to this }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 <#/>One is that uh <./>educati lack of education <#/>The other thing is uh some taboos uh influence some mot
hers to breast-feed their children for only one or two months because they introduce uh other foods other than breast milk too early and therefore when the baby for example starts <ea/>uji at two months and the baby's stomach gets full up the child cannot
 
feed and therefore when we put the babies to breast then the baby <-/>baby can't suck the mother cannot produce milk and therefore when the baby sucks an empty breast he will automatically refuse because this mother gets then gets a vicious circle my chil
d
 is not sucking and the baby gets angry because the mother is not producing enough milk and therefore the mothers the mother and the child they are all stressed and they end up mother saying look I <-/>I can't breast-feed my child <#/>And that's one of th
e
 main <-_reason><+_reasons> and that's why we encourage mothers to get all the support not only uh in the <-_hostel><+_hospital> but home also the society can give support to these mothers yeah and they can continue uh doing so until they are two years <#
/
>I understand that there are mothers who are working <#/>Usually in Tanzania the maternity leave is very short uh for a breast-feeding mother <#/>This should be actually uh prolonged so that the mothers are able to provide this very important nutrient to 
their babies and even when they are uh <-_>they are<-/> working mothers
\par <$A> <#/>It is also believed that uh breast-feeding is best for mothers <#/>How is it useful
\par <$B> <#/>Well uh breast-feeding is actually very useful to the mother <#/>One or the best uh
 uh <-_examples><+_example> we can give is it provides a natural protection against uh early pregnancy <#/>If the child is exclusively breast-feeding the mother will get lactational <?/>mnoria and will get uh uh <./>pot uh uh a natural contraception and t
h
erefore will not get uh uh uh pregnant <#/>Two the mother uh gets uh love if particularly if the family is involved and in <-/>in taking care of a mother who is lactating and also it <-/>it helps the mother to remove the extra fat which she gained during 
p
regnancy which is important for ladies to remember this because even if you put on twelve kilos during pregnancy I can assure you that it will go away by the time you have been breast-feeding for the first six months but if you breast-feed for only two mo
nths uh is very difficult to uh remove all that fat which was laid down for the baby and also for you
\par <$A> <#/>Uh what about fathers uh breast-feeding is also best for them
\par <$B> <#/>Yes uh uh the fathers of course they should understand this <#/>If you have
 got a mother who is breast-feeding uh we have stressed the <-/>the <-/>the love the warmth the economy and the uh <-_>and the uh<-/> <-_>and the<-/> growth of the child both mentally and physically and uh if you have got a healthy child at home who is no
t
 going to <-_>hostel><+_hospital> because of diarrhoea because the mother didn't breast-feed the father will be very happy yeah and also not only that <#/>If the father is a supporting husband to his wife then uh this particular wife will also get this uh
 
very important support and the father will be even a happier father and <./>ac <-/>and they actually could spend more time at home instead of spending his money to drink away while the mother is busy breast-feeding and yet another thing with the fathers w
h
ich they should do to help the mothers so that they will be able to breast-feed is to make sure that the mother is resting having some rest during lactation because if the mother doesn't get enough rest then she does not have uh she does not produce enoug
h
 milk and uh she uses her energy to do other works which the father actually can help like looking for firewood water particularly in Tanzania whereby mothers they have got to walk miles even <-/>even <-/> even for hours and the <-_>and the<-/> father is 
<
./>si sitting at home <#/>And I think it's important for fathers to really give this nice support and they will be both happy and uh also if you can space your children yeah then you have got you have you can plan actually when you are going to have your 
children and these issues can only be discussed and uh and understood if the father also <-_take><+_takes> the initiative in learning the advantages of breast-feeding
\par <$A> <#/>I have another interesting question Dr Masawe that some tribes in this country like the Wagogo prefer to feed their babies using one breast <#/>Do you think that is the best way
\par <$B> <#/>No nature it's provided a human being with two breasts one on the left on the right <#/>Animals if they have got many puppies like uh <-/>like uh l<-/
>ike goats or even the lions they have got many more breasts <#/>This is a natural survival and human beings have been <-_>have been<-/> <-_>have been<-/> created by god that uh they have two breasts that means you have got enough too for that child and u
h
 <-/>and uh it's unfortunate that you <-/>you have actually found this in Dodoma <#/>Not only Dodoma in Singida in Coast-region and so on there is a belief among which is a <-/>a bad taboo and needs a lot of uh education looking deep into the roots and ca
u
ses of this but uh this is not the right way of uh actually practising this method <#/>Unilateral breast-feeding uh does produce uh insufficient milk to the child yeah <#/>Unless the mother has got a disease on one breast in a lot of breast-feeding it sho
u
ld be discouraged <#/>Taboos which are or uh bad cultures which are encouraging unilateral breast-feeding like in Dodoma and Singida should be discouraged and uh <-/>and uh these mothers are the ones <-_which><+_who> actually who should be be able to be e
ducated particularly the community where she lives <#/>So this culture can <./>slow slowly die away
\par <$A> <#/>Can you give us uh the trend of breast-feeding in this country <#/>Is it rising or declining or stagnant
\par <$B> <#/>Yeah the trend if you look at the 
trend in the urban areas the trend of breast-feeding is on the decline <#/>Figures quoted in from Dar es Salaam uh uh mothers uh uh who are in urban areas uh particularly the high income group the tendency to breast-feed has declined and in the rural area
s
 uh it is supposed to be about hundred per cent who breast-feed <#/>But what is very <./>impor what is very interesting is that the exclusive breast-feeding is also <./>i on the decline even in the rural areas and uh this could be the <-/>the introduction
 
of uh <-/>of uh urban <-/>urban culture into the villages where people have thought uh that bottle feeding is uh superior to breast-feeding and I think uh this should be uh known to all Tanzanians that this trend uh should be actually kept to the maximum 
t
hat our children are totally breast-fed that means <?/>close breast-fed and continue breast-feeding and that's why we have got uh uh this programme on uh educating health workers in particular and educating the community yeah and we'd like the mass media 
to <-/>to continue this nice programme so that the community can be well conversant with the advantages of breast-feeding <X_>}{\v\fs24 and uh we should not be on the decline now We hope in the future it will be on the increase
\par <$A> <#/>I <-/>I also believe that most of the women uh especially the young mothers are not aware <-_about><+_of> }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\v\fs24 
 the proper handling of the baby uh while they breast-feed and uh sometimes they might come to the clinic and saying the baby is not sucking well or the nipples are paining Now
 do you have a special <-_clinics><+_clinic> that might enlighten women on <./>lacta lactation management
\par <$B> <#/>Well thank you very much This is a very nice question Uh here comes the point we would like to stress very much in support of breast-feeding 
uh We have now started uh uh breast-feeding support group in uh <-/>in uh Muhimbili and uh we have uh covered several regions in training health workers on the advantages of breast-feeding on the lactation management and therefore we would expect these su
p
port teams should start in the <-_hostel><+_hospital> environment and even spread in the communities and even use uh uh uh uh different religious organisations uh gatherings like in the mosque uh in the <-_>in the<-/> church around the uh and uh even <-/>
e
ven the villages to form uh what there are called breast-feeding support groups and uh these can help a lot uh particularly in young mothers although we don't encourage adolescent pregnancy uh to be able to breast-feed their babies and continue breast-fee
d
ing and you are quite right young mothers particularly if they have never been taught the advantages of breast-feeding yeah they can't continue breast-feeding after <-/>after delivery if uh something wrong happens to them like uh a lot of the problems we 
h
ave just mentioned If a mother had got has got a crack nipple for example it is painful for the mother to breast-feed She needs support She needs encouragement She should be told why the child the mother had a cracked nipple For example one of the causes 
o
f cracked nipple is a bad positioning of the baby The baby if he sucks on the nipple he will crack the nipple and not only that Other problems like breast engorgement which is a very common complication for a <-/>a delay in initiation of breast-feeding an
d
 also uh uh uh feeding on demand uh <./>cou does produce breast engorgement and this is a very painful problem to the mothers and if <./>it left <./>un <./>un untreated <-/>by by expressing the milk and the baby sucking the breast the mother can develop u
h
 mastitis and even can develop an abscess and this becomes uh a big problem to the mother and uh this she has to be treated this is also uh very painful to the mother and uh may force to breast-feed on one breast while the other breast is <-/>is still sic
k
 until it recovers So it is very important that the education of the <-_>of the<-/> young mothers is done not only by the routine uh uh talking to mothers or teaching them but also it should be done by support groups <./>shou we <-/>we strongly advise all
 
health units in this country should have support groups in their <-_hostel><-_hospital> should have experts who can advise mothers what to do when they are in problems and mothers when they're in problems they should go to people who are experts on lactat
i
on in their particular area and that's why we are spreading all this knowledge to cover most of the uh areas in this country I am glad to <./>rep <-/>to report to you in with the help of the UNICEF which is in the forefront of campaigning uh this uh <-/>t
h
is uh uh uh important uh programme in breast-feeding in this country and also with the support of TFNC this is Tanzanian for Nutrition Centre we have now uh uh covered uh a number of regions now in training the health workers and hope this knowledge will 
t
rickle down to the villages and uh in each regions we have uh covered uh Probably if you want to know we have covered Kilimanjaro we have covered Tanga region uh Arusha region Dodoma Singida Dar es Salaam Coast Region uh Mbeya Iringa and uh we hope the ot
h
er regions should be covered by the end of the year and uh uh we think that by covering all these areas teaching health workers how uh <-/>how best they should form these support groups in their places of work then they can spread this knowledge uh to the
 community and uh recently we even got people from Zanzibar uh to <-/>to join our <-/>our programmes so that they can uh go back and train their people
\par <$A> <#/>What would you advise a mother who is breast-feeding while she has already conceived because this is a problem and most of our grandmothers say it's bad to breast-feed a baby while you are pregnant
\par <$B> <#/>Well our advice uh from the lactation management team is to uh if the mother is getting enough <-_nutrient><+_nutrients> Remember a mother who's 
lactating has got extra uh <-/>extra calories to <-/>to <-/>to breast-feed the child and for herself and if she's got if she is having }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24 
 another baby in the uterus she need <-_>she need<-/> also extra nutrients for this particular baby uh we enco
urage the mother if the mother is healthy to continue breast-feeding There's no harm on the child it doesn't cause diarrhoea and actually nature is so nice As the <-_mothers><+_mother> becomes pregnant when the pregnancy advances you'll find the amount of
 
the milk given through the breast is just a token so that uh by that time the child will just get a token milk We have seen mothers uh who deliver and the other child <./> wa <-_>is also<-/> was also sucking and <./>it <./>we you should not discourage mot
h
ers if they are willing to breast-feed and the grandmothers who advise the mothers to do that they know that probably it will kill the other baby or it will cause uh diarrhoea in this uh uh older child who is already born but uh as long as the mother is g
e
tting enough nutrients and as the mother has no uh uh problem which has been uh told by the grandmothers or friend or whatever we should not uh recommend mothers to suddenly stop breast <./>fee it has got a side effect on this particular child It cuts off
 the emotional bonding and uh this is not a very good sign for the child Let the child stops the breast-feeding itself <./>the It's automatic because as the pregnancy grows the milk supply will diminish
\par <$A> <#/>What are your views to women especially young mothers in making breast-feeding and proper waning practices in child survival development a success
\par <$B> <#/>Our advice to breast-feeding mothers uh is <-/>is to stress that breast-feeding uh does make your child survive better uh particularly when you s
tart weaning at the right time with the right uh weaning food and uh the right amount and given at right frequency We advise mothers to <-/>to use locally made food and also uh the child uh at around uh when the child finished four months should uh be int
r
oduced sort of what you say be really accustomed to the local diet uh <O/> sort of test the child with the <-/>the local <-/>local <./>a available food which is available at home like <ea/>Uji or <ea/><O/> and so on and uh this is uh important As the chil
d
 grows then the mother will learn actually the child will <-/>will feed on demand from the mother and also the mother will realise the child will need uh to increase the frequency and the amount and by the time the child is one year the child should be ab
l
e to take about five meals a day and <-/>and <-/>and thereby also continuing with the breast-feeding and by the time the child is two years old the child is <./>als already accustomed to even the <-_>even the<-/> adult food at home and <./>prob what we'll
 
advise mothers is that young children should have their portion maybe already so that they don't have to share with other children so that she knows exactly what amount of food the child has taken and uh when the mothers usually send the children they we 
a
dvise also <-_mother><+_mothers> to send the children to the clinic where they can <-_>they can<-/> check their weight gain and they also identify uh problems uh If you start your child weaning too early like in Dar es Salaam where we have found that moth
ers do introduce weaning foods around one month then we get into problems in the future of the child

\par }{\v\fs24 <$A> <#/>Dr Augustin Masawe lactation management consultant at the Muhimbili Medical Centre talking about the advantages of breast-feeding for mot

\par }{\v\fs24 <&-><$A> Presenter <?/>Penzi, m.
\par <$B> Doctor Louis <?/>Mlingi Director of Tanzania Occupational Health Services, m. }{\v\fs24 </&>}{\v\fs24 
\par }{\fs24 <I> <$A><X_> }{\v\fs24 <#/>held in Dar es Salaam recently <#/>He begins by outlining the objectives of the organisation in an interview with <name/> of Radio of Tanzania}{\fs24 </X>
\par <$B> <#/>Well Tanzania Occupational Health Service its major objective }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  is preventive services to ensure }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 healthy workforce in our industries <#/>So we have to think of the major objectives in ensuring occupational health amongst the work force and uh one of the
 objectives of ensuring occupational health amongst the workforce is uh uh uh <-/>is <./>light is enlightening the workforce from the <-_>from the<-/> roots and ways of preventing uh occupational hazards and where occupational hazards are not easy to prev
e
nt uh we happen to get a lot of injured workforce at the places of work <#/>So the objective of this short course was to equip uh employees as well as employers and those who are interested in uh safeguarding the life of an injured person with the knowled
ge and techniques of uh industrial first aid
\par <$C> <#/>Did you have specific qualifications for the participants who were involved in the course
\par <$B> <#/>Well we did <#/>We actually did because we did announce in our local media <#/>The Daily News uh the seminar when it was supposed to take place the dates the venue and the duration and in the announcement we did exactly specify what quality of pe
r
sonnel we needed to attend the course uh <#/>We wanted the industrial uh safety officers <#/>We wanted foremen shift supervisors uh <#/>We also wanted some individuals from the management of the organisations because uh industrial first aid provision is a
n
 expensive affair <#/>You've got to purchase some equipment <#/>You've got to have uh the gadgets ready available at the place of work so that you could provide industrial uh first aid <#/>So we <-/>we did specify exactly whom we need for the course and i
t
 is not actually very proper that you've got to have qualified individuals to do industrial first aid uh <#/>You can have anybody because industrial first aid or first aid as such is provided everywhere <#/>It's provided on the major highways <#/>It's pro
vided in industries <#/>It's provided at home <#/>It's provided even in offices <#/>It's provided well uh practically everywhere <#/>So it's proper that everybody every able adult should be able to know uh something about first aid as such
\par <$C> <#/>I would like also to know whether the course was a practical one or you just did it theoretically 
\par <$B> <#/>Well uh we <-/>we did manage to get a very good comment from one of the participants because we did actually manage to intermarry theory and practicals and 
we believe that the participants did actually benefit from both theory and the practicals which we did uh provide them }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
\par <$C> <#/>Can you tell us the what exactly made you to involve }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  workers only to attend the course
\par <$B> <#/>Well tha
nks Penzi <#/>You know the our clients who whom we give uh services in this organisation are mainly employees in industries uh <#/>The major question is I mean industries are not only those working with machines in factories producing you know uh finished
 
goods <#/>No agriculture is also an industry <#/>So when we say that our clients are workers in industry we don't mean only the workers working with machinery in factories we also mean uh every able person who is working uh <#/>So what we actually did it 
w
as not the intention was not to involve only the workers but our major clients whom we provide services in this organisation are employers and employees of the surrounding uh industries <#/>So we did target the workers of these particular industries to at
tend the seminar
\par <$C> <#/>It is so simple to say first aid but uh I think to medicine people it might uh mean or it might involve many things <#/>Now what do we mean by first aid
\par <$B> <#/>Okay thank you very much <#/>Well the definition of first aid is a bi
t complicated but we can easily just say that it is actually the initial but essential treatment provided to an injured individual as a step towards more competent hospital treatment <#/>So it is a life uh saving situation which a first aider is first wit
h on the initial step of uh ensuring the <-_>the the<-/> the saving of an injured the saving of life of an injured person
\par <$C> <#/>Is it possible for an ordinary person uh who is not a nurse or a doctor to provide first aid service
\par <$B> <#/>Well sure well y
ou remember at the beginning I said that it is very important for uh an adult to know something about first aid and the necessity why we think that uh every adult should know something about first aid is just imagine at home your child could most probably
 
grab a bottle of let's say drugs or poison accidentally and drink it and uh you don't know what to do but in the short course we had there was a topic of poisoning by mouth that is the participants were enlightened on what to do and how to handle an injur
e
d person who has been poisoned by mouth So it is very possible for an ordinary person <#/>It's possible for a mother <#/>It's possible for a father <#/>It's possible for a you know somebody who just is a street vendor to know something about first aid and
 to be able to provide first aid to an injured person
\par <$C> <#/>Let us now go more practically as far as first aid is concerned then how would one assist a person or while on duty his leg or arm is cut off by an object
\par <$B> <#/>Okay thanks very much Penzi uh
 <#/>That's an interesting question uh <#/>I remember when I was young my dad once told me that if you see somebody bitten by a snake what you do first is you <-/>you put a <?/>tonicate on the proximal end of the bitten limb in order to prevent the uh up-
f
low of the poison to the circulatory system uhm and then I think what he said was having done that you've got to get a razor blade or a sharp object and you make a thorough cut a deep cut on the bitten side so that the poison would uh ooze out <#/>Well yo
u
r question was how would one assist a person whose arm or leg has been cut off <#/>I think the major threatening of life in that aspect is the injured person is <slang/>gonna bleed to death because there are major blood vessels which are widely open after
 
the amputation of the limb <#/>So the first idea what I think uh a first aider should do is to ensure that there is no unnecessary blood loss uh to the cut-off leg or arm as you said <#/>So what he's supposed to do first is apply a <?/>tonicate <#/>Now yo
u
 apply a <?/>tonicate on the proximal side of the amputated limb in order to prevent uh blood loss and again you make sure that you rush the patient very fast to a nearby uh hospital where proper surgical toilet could be done and proper hemostasis so the 
blood vessels could be tied
\par <$C> <#/>Now what happens when a person who got an accident would not be able to get first aid service and let us say when life is threatened
\par <$B> <#/>Okay that's a good question because you said when life is threatened yeah <#/>
It's true uh let's look at it this way supposing somebody is involved in an accident and uh let us assume that he's got an artificial danger in his mouth and this artificial danger uh slips into the throat and most probably blocks the airway <#/>Well uh f
o
r a first aider when he observes such an injured person the first thing he's got to note is whether the <-/>the injured person is breathing or not breathing <#/>If he's not breathing the first step is to make sure that the injured person is breathing <#/>
S
o when he looks into the airways the nose the mouth he might find that there are these artificial dangers blocking the airway <#/>So the first thing he's got to do is to get it out and uh place the injured person in a manner that the airway's free so that
 
uh he or she can breathe easily uh <#/>Depends on the speed of how the first aider could do this uh injured person could start breathing normally  and in such a situation where life was exactly threatened the first aider has managed to save the life of th
e individual
\par <$C> <#/>I remember you told us that one of the objectives of the course was to equip the industrial or to equip industrial people with the knowledge on first aid uh <#/>Do you have other reasons that have prompted you to conduct such a course
\par <$B> <#/>Oh yes sure well uh <#/>It's a <-_>it's a<-/> question of being useful to the public uh Prevention they say is better than cure uh <#/>If you think I mean if you take into consideration the liberalisation nowadays of uh our industries and the lib
e
ralisation of the economy of the nation uh there are so many things which we are importing right now in terms of raw materials in terms of machinery and these raw materials and machinery do not take into account the safety of the workforce <#/>So the majo
r reason again why we thought that first aid is important amongst the workforce is to safeguard them with the pending idea that the safety of the work environment is uh endangered
\par <$C> <#/>I am sure most of the participants uh were those who have uh a bit of knowledge about health issues <#/>Now why should you involve such people in that course while they are already well educated about health issues
\par <$B> <#/>Uh not really I wouldn't say that all the participants were amongst the individuals with the knowled
ge on uh medical issues or health issues <#/>No we had some engineers and we had some uh shift supervisors <#/>We had some industrial safety officers and also we had the medical personnel and their nurses uh that is <?/>dent doctors in various workplaces 
b
ut this doesn't matter really because there is uh a proverb of which says that repetition is the mother of knowledge <#/>Well whether you are a doctor or a nurse and whether you passed through uh the academic ladders of classrooms you've got to keep on at
t
ending seminars attending workshops you know seeing new developments in medical field and uh the major reason I think why we did involve such persons with uh medical knowledge is we also wanted to share the experiences in their place of work and uh also w
e
 wanted to train them so that they can train others on the industrial first aid so it was a matter of a give and take affair <#/>Those who had something to give us we were very thankful we got it from them and those had something to get from us <#/>I thin
k we are also thankful that we managed to give them something
\par <$C> <#/>How successful is the course so far
\par <$B> <#/>Well uh we did evaluate the course <#/>We did evaluate <#/>We did some evaluation after the course and we did manage to get some comments fro
m the participants uh <#/>I would most probably mention a few comments <#/>One of the comments was that they feel that the course was rather short <#/>They felt that we could give it about two more days to make it at least a week or five days and uh also 
t
hey felt that some of the periods were too short to be able to cope with uh both theory and practical so they suggested that the periods could be a bit longer <#/>So if you got longer periods then you'll have more days of the seminar and again they some o
f
 them mentioned that they never knew that this organisation has the objective of ensuring health and safety at workforce <#/>So it was their pleasure to know that and uh they also managed to give us a pat on the back that the course should be conducted mo
re frequently and we did appreciate their comments <#/>So in conclusion we said that the seminar or the short course was very successful
\par <$C> <#/>So you have an intention of organising another seminar of the same kind in future
\par <$B> <#/>Well Penzi you know 
we organise such seminars every now and then and we've got a schedule We've got a total of three short courses which we will conduct in the course <-_>in the course<-/> of the year <#/>We have an industrial first aid for the uh low cadres and we have indu
strial first aid course for the uh trainers and we have health and safety at work uh for uh the industrial safety officers for the uh workshop officers for the production section and also for the resident medical officers <X_>}{\v\fs24 
and again we have the occupational 
health and safety courses for the uh managers which we conduct in the course of the year so this is just one of the courses we conduct normally and we are soon to conduct another one which we'll announce in the newspapers
\par <$C> <#/>What can you say about the number of injured workers Is it increasing or decreasing 
\par <$B> <#/>Well that's difficult to tell because uh you know when you say the number is increasing or decreasing you've got to have a baseline You've got to have done a research and get a fixed numb
er and you say that in the course of the year the number of injured persons let's say is this one and taking that number as your baseline if the number increases above that which you did <./>rese which you had earlier then you could say it is increasing a
n
d if it falls below that you would say that it is decreasing Well by that I would like to say that we haven't had a specific number of uh let's say accidents or injured individuals or injured <./>wor workers in the factories uh We do admit some injured wo
rkers in our wards in this in the hospital and the number has been fluctuating but I think before you would be able to say it's either increasing or decreasing you need to do more than that
\par <$C> <#/>People believe that prevention is better than cure Now what actions do you suggest that might help to prevent accidents at work place
\par <$B> <#/>Okay thank you Penzi Well I wish you could attend one of our courses in the occupational uh health and safety courses We've got uh a period in there which we actually expo
unded to a very big magnitude and together with that we also take participants to the uh industries you know to do some practicals What we actually do with that is we train the participants in the classroom what we say uh an eagle view of the problems in 
t
he work place That is you do some sort of inventory It's <-/>it's an inventory of uh the potential occupational hazards at the workplace So what we expect you to do is if you are one of the participants you go to the work place and you just see an employe
e
 working You see the machine he's working with whether it's safe enough you see the way he's dressed whether he's got protective <-_gears><+_gear> You see the position ergonomics how he is working uh You see the lighting You see the ventilation You see th
e
 temperature you know then you <-_>you you<-/> come and sit down and say okay if that employee is working on his feet for eight hours a day I mean how long what problems is he going to have and how could we do that how could you <-_>how could you<-/> sugg
e
st Could you suggest a method of you know getting rid of that problem and uh if so when you look at that environment you try to pinpoint what are the possible dangers what are the possible occupational hazards which can befall <-_on> that employee in the 
c
ourse of his work for the next you know three four five years Okay having been able to identify the problems that is taking the inventory of the problems at the place of work you then sit down and think what are the remedies what can be done Can the light
i
ng be improved Can ventilation be improved Can the environment the temperature environment be improved Can the ergonomic position of the employee be improved Can the machine if it's not well guarded be improved Protective clothes should be provided of wha
t
 nature of what choice uh so many things So uh when you are able to do that when you are actually able to prevent the potential danger which can befall uh the employee now that is prevention as such You wouldn't expect let's say industrial accidents and u
h
 if you can prevent industrial accident then most probably you'll need industrial first aiders So you'll see that there is actually an equilibrium between uh ensuring health and safety at work uh being aware of the occupational hazards and if you are able
 
if you are aware of those and you can prevent them then you don't expect any industrial catastrophe and as such you wouldn't need industrial first aid but with the current situation where the industrial safety is not in its right I mean is not in the top 
gear then you expect industrial hazards you expect accidents to happen and so industrial first aid is important
\par <$C> <#/>Do you encounter any problems in providing health service with your clients
\par <$B> <#/>Well you know this organisation from its very incep
tion in nineteen sixty-seven had its resources from donor countries and donor individuals Well currently there is this what you call donor fatigue and such assistance is not easy to come by nowadays so we actually depend on the member companies you know t
o
 run this organisation in the sense that they pay for the services which are provided to their employees uh So this one the development of this organisation depending entirely on the services provided to the employees uh of industries is not enough actual
l
y to develop this organisation further So we actually run into problems with the uh employers to uh assist this organisation in the sense of you know paying their bills promptly and uh donating here and there so that we develop this organisation and we ar
e still pursuing this course of soliciting more aid from the member companies from well-wishers from donors to assist us in the end in order to develop this organisation further
\par <$C> <#/>Uh finally what are your views to people on applying first aid whenever accidents occur
\par <$B> <#/>Well my views are that the ministry of health should take this as a challenge uh We can begin with the drivers you know driving buses in towns
 up-country buses uh They've got to have first aid equipment in their buses and most probably the drivers and their conductors should be trained in first aid knowledge and uh the ministry of health should take the challenge also to ensure that those worki
n
g in the dispensaries and in rural health centres they know something about first aid provision you know at home uh in the <?/>fields You know there is first aid in the snake-bite There is first aid in accidental poisoning and at homes There is first aid 
i
n a you know pesticide poisoning agriculture uh There are so many things the ministry can do and it can have trained people you can have trained people in industrial first aid and place them you know in various uh places target places to educate the other

 for the year discussed or for five years
\par <$B> <#/>Thank you <#/>Oral health goals for Zanzibar year two thousand and three are comparable with similarly oral health goals for mainland Tanzania mainland 
<#/>I mean we have divided these goals in three primary secondary and tertiary <#/>The primary goals requiring preventive educational and investigative activities <#/>Goal number one The percentage of five to six years old who will be caries-free is tenta
t
ively fixed at fifty per cent <#/>That is goal number one <#/>Goal number two The prevalence of endemic fluorosis needs further investigation before the <./>revel revelance of goals can be determined <#/>Goal number three Twelve-year-old children will on 
average have no more than two point five DMFT that is decayed missing and filled teeth <#/>Goal number four In twelve-year-olds <O/> bleeding will occur in no more than two sextant <O/> CPITN index <#/>Goal number five in primary goal }{\b\v\fs24 
<&/>grammar}{\fs24  Eighty per
 cent of population should retain all their teeth excluding molars at the age of eighteen Primary goal number six <#/>More data on the level of <?/>edentulousness within the age group thirty-five to forty-four and fifty-five and above are needed before se
tting a goal if uh there is any <?/>edentulous at the age of thirty-five uh <#/>You know the meaning of the word <?/>edentulous Toothless mouth uh }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>chuckles}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 
<#/>Primary goal number seven All uh <-/>all mothers attending MCH clinics and all twelve-year-ol
d primary school pupils will receive oral health education as part of general health education programmes <#/>Also there's these secondary goals which require curative activities <#/>In <./>primar in primary goals we need only preventive educational and i
nvestigative only but in secondary we require curative and this one is much expensive }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 in implementing <#/>Goal number eight we continue Seventy-two per cent of the DMFT index in twelve-year-old children will be composed of the decayed component 
<#/>Goal number nine Twenty per cent of the DMFT index in twelve-year-old children will be composed of the missing component and number ten eight per cent eight per cent of the DMFT index in twelve-year-old children will be composed of the filling compone
n
t and the third tertiary goal this requiring administrative activities <#/>Goal eleven from this tertiary goal the entire population will have access to <./>equitable equitably distributed emergency and preventive oral health services within less than hal
f a day's journey from their place of residence and the last goal <#/>A data-based system for monitoring changes in oral health and the implementation of oral health programmes will be established
\par <$A> <#/>Oh Thank you very much <#/>What I have observed or 
what I have heard from you is that your oral health goals suggested for the year two thousand and three have been formulated in accordance with World Health Organisation recommendations regarding health for all by year two thousand
\par <$B> <#/><-/>uhu
\par <$A> <#/>Is that okay
\par <$B> <#/><-/>uhu 
\par <$A> <#/>And uh they are nearly the same as the Tanzanian mainland
\par <$B> <#/><-/>uhu
\par <$A> <#/>So what uh or rather let's say which strategies or do you have any strategies which can be applied in order to approach the goals for the year two thousand and three
\par <$B> <#/><-/>uhu At present there are few data available on this particular age group for goal number one I mean 
\par <$A> <#/><-/>uhu
\par <$B> <#/>Because we have divided each goal and the strategies so it will therefore be necessary to carry out }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 clinical <./>epidemi epidemiological survey to set an accurate goal uh <#/>The provisional percentage is a rough estimate derived from the corresponding goal of sixty to sixty-five per cent for mainland <#/>Achieving awarene
ss of oral health and disease as well as daily oral hygiene habits in young children and their mothers through oral health education in the MCH clinics is going to be }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 main contribution for this age group throughout the current five year period <#/>Okay <#/>Should sign of sustained increase of caries arise}{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 <./>com combined with a change in the pattern of caries progression to other occlusal surfaces a fluoride intervention programme might be considered in particular the feasibility of 
fluoridation of piped drinking water in Zanzibar town <#/>As in goal number two this strategy is about fluoride <O/> <#/>Existing level of naturally occurring fluoride in drinking water are known }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 for Zanzibar town only because there <-/>there is no proper data <#/>In order to decide on }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 proper means of dental caries prevention mapping of fluoride contents of drinking water should be undertaken as a minimum in areas suspected of dental <
?/>fluorosis for example the coastal area between Uwa and Jambiani <-/>uhu <#/>Okay No question <#/>From goal number two uh and goal number three and four these usually go together <#/>The DMFT for children aged twelve to thirteen begins around two point 
five Therefore the goal of two point five for that two <-/>two thousand and three <O/> and<O_>}{\b\v\fs24 two or three words}{\fs24 
<O/> of status quo <#/>And as for <?/>periodontal disease the goal has been set arbitrarily using the mainland criteria although recommended by W
HO uh the CPITN for this age group has not yet been introduced <#/>But in Zanzibar like in many other countries the twelve-year-olds have been selected as the main group
\par <$A> <#/>uh I'm sorry to intervene you have said that what is the meaning of CPITN
\par <$B
> <#/>This is a the <-/>the special index we are using to represent community <?/>periodontal index of treatment needs <#/>On examination of these pupils or these <./>chi children we are using this reflecting index to detect their problem in their mouth <
#/>Okay I think you get it 
\par <$A> <#/>Yah
\par <$B> <#/>As I said Zanzibar is a country where twelve-year-olds are the pilot <-/>pilot group okay for prevention or intervention as you know <#/>Primary or level number two will be <O/> with the aid of this age grou
p that means twelve-year-olds <#/>Actually combined with twelve-year-olds standard four to five mainly standard four to five <-/>uhu
\par <$A> <#/>Well I think uh I've got the strategies and I think there are so many but uh from the few which I have got I think uh you know as a health officer here in charge I think you are in charge here have you taken any trouble on }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{
\b\fs24  }{\fs24 visiting areas very important areas like schools because I've heard that you mention pupils or in rural areas to <-/>to give them any dent
al health education because what I have noticed from your point uh is that the age you mention there range }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 from five years old to fifteen to sixteen years old and uh if you go there to visit uh those pupils uh what do you recommend them to do and how far you are going there }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 to maybe <-/>to check if they are uh doing what you are telling them to do
\par <$B> <#/>Well up to now from where we've set these goals we are facing }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  many problems especially these financial problems <#/>To set goals it is very simple you know because it's just to sit on a table }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{
\fs24  and then writing
\par <$A> <#/>Yah
\par <$B> <#/>but in implementing you're going to face a lot of problems <#/>As you know the problem comes like transport <#/>First of all to reach to }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24 
 the <-_>to the<-/> schools or in clinics for example in poorer rural areas it is difficult for us uh <#/>We're having }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 this problem of transport and once you have this transport and you reach there sometimes you can find that they a
re not well prepared to <-/>to meet us because the information maybe was not proper but we are trying to reach them and mainly we are trying to go to these clinics MCH clinics because we want to start to give mothers oral health education because when you
 
treat a <-_>treat a<-/> woman when you treat a woman you treat a family as you know <#/>So we are trying to teach mothers how to take care of their of the teeth <-_>of the<-/> of their children and then because this it costs less I think you can say that 
just the transport will be enough to reach }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 but when you want to go to schools you need more things <#/>You need to teach the pupils to do some pretty things like tooth brushing and then let's say play <-/>play these games because you have so man
y activities in schools but in MCH programme you can see they're just <-_>they're just<-/> talking and I think we are trying to communicate with these DANIDA so they can help us supply these things so we can implement properly these goals we have already 
settled I think I have answered your
\par <$A> <#/>Yes but uh I don't think I'm prying on your matters }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24  but uh after all who is the <-_>who is the<-/> donor maybe of this programme because what I know is that uh things like dental health care or any othe
r thing I think they are connected with big uh organisations in donor countries 
\par <$B> <#/>As I said actually these Danish I mean DANIDA are sponsoring }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  <#/>They promised us to supply many many things so we are waiting but we <-/>we have already 
started to do these things which can be implemented without having transport attending MCH clinics which are very nearby including towns or schools which are in towns <#/>But the problem actually is uh the children in schools because our problem main prob
lem is once you go to school you teach uh the pupil how to <-/>to clean your teeth <-/>uhu how to know which tooth is bad which is good <#/>Once they\rquote ve found out they have got a bad tooth then they'll come
\par <$A> <#/>to your clinic
\par <$B
> <#/>and I think there are going to be many many pupils because we have <./>sta <-_>we have<-/> started to visit town schools primary schools in town <#/>And as you know in town there is much more dental caries than in rural <./>area areas I think you kn
ow why
\par <$A> <#/>No
\par <$B> <#/>This is because of sugar consumption in towns <#/>They've got these <O_>}{\b\v\fs24 two or three words}{\fs24 <O/> and so on <#/>That's available in town then so
\par <$A> <#/>But in rural areas I think they have things like sugar canes and maybe other things
\par <$B> <#/>Actually sugar cane is not uh you <-/>you <-/>you wouldn't call it as a <O/> food because when you chew uh let's say when you chew this sugar cane you will chew until finally you're going to brush your teeth with the <-_>with the<-/> what yo
u call uh after you have chewed the 
\par <$A> <#/>remainder 
\par <$B> <#/>yah yah <#/>I mean the remainder of the <#/>You are going to brush your teeth with that <#/>So as you know the dangerous sugar we are saying here is these <ea/>pipis chewing gums because they are sticking }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
\par <$A> <#/>Well then I think I have to thank you very much for providing me or supplying me with this information Thank you very much

 tremendous efforts towards children's development <#/>In this in
terview with Radio Tanzania's <name/> Mungumi the Director of the Centre Mustafa <name/> outlines the main activities of the organisation <#/>He begins by telling us the kind of rights they're fighting }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_for>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 for the children in Mwanza 
\par <$B> <#/>
Well what we're trying to do is fight for all the rights of children in Mwanza <#/>Uh if you take into account the UN convention for the rights for the child which Tanzania has already signed uh there are about eighteen rights that are encompassed in that
 
<-_>in that<-/> convention uh <#/>These include rights for a child to have access to good health services access to education especially primary education access to uh uh <-_>to their basic <./>nee having their basic needs met and that includes having she
lter access to a loving respectful environment and access to a place to play a place where they can come and children can call their own and make it whatever they would like to make it make of it 
\par <$C> <#/>And uh which <-/>which type of children do you concentrate <-_with><+_on> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$B> <#/>Okay currently we're working mainly with street children in Mwanza and by street children I mean those who have been completely abandoned and are on the streets of <-/>of Mwanza who are not with any adult uh who are
 trying to make do with life on their own 
\par <$C> <#/>And why the street children alone because we have the orphans and those coming from poor families and uh I think they all need to get their rights <#/>What is so special to }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  the street children 

\par <
$B> <#/>Well the issue really is <-/>is a voice I mean street children children in general are not very well heard in our society and they <-/>they <-/>they tend to be neglected they tend to be put on the side when they have a suggestion to make you say u
h
 you're just a child stay away from me but when you look at the issue of street children because even among children you have different hierarchies well street children are the most marginalised of all children <#/>Their voices are not heard uh <#/>They a
r
e often interpreted in very negative ways <#/>Either they're thieves they're trouble makers uh in Swahili <ea/>wajambasi in all kinds of ways which <-/>which portray them negatively so when they try to say something let's say look we need access to educat
i
on we need access to shelter we need access to uh <-/>to a good place to have a shower for all that it matters nobody listens everyone is quiet <#/>There's not a single group in <-/>in <-/>in <#/>There's not very many groups that have taken up their issue
s
 and said we'll work with you we'll work with you we'll fight together with you we'll fight for your rights <#/>Unfortunately because this is a world that is <./>adul that is interpreted through adults' eyes and adults' voices the children need adult supp
orters to be with them so that their voices can be heard and <?/>Koleana is an organisation which is here to do that to be with the children so that they can fight for their own rights 
\par <$C> <#/>That's very interesting Mustafa but uh I would like also to know how many children do you provide them }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  with the accommodation at the centre 
\par <$B> <#/>Okay the accommodation as I said before is just very basic stuff <#/>When we started we didn\rquote t intend to have accommodation <#/>We were <-_>We were<-/> hopi
ng to make the street safer for the children but that hasn't worked uh partly because the adult world is so hostile to the children so what we have provided are bamboo <-/>bamboo beddings which are very popular here in Mwanza and we put them on the verand
a
 and the children sleep on them and they have a bedsheet to cover them with <#/>Uh but it's open-air sleeping full of mosquitoes <#/>We've put some mosquito coils but uh we still have a lot of malaria infection <#/>We're not intending to put up anything b
i
g because it's extremely extremely expensive to build and one mattress for example the cheapest mattress here in Mwanza costs something like fifteen or sixteen thousand shillings <#/>Multiply that by hundred and you have a massive figure and the number of
 children keeps increasing so we would like our capacity to work with children not to be limited uh by providing them with full-time shelter 
\par <$C> <#/>That is at least an accommodation and rather than sleeping <-_in><+_on> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  the pavements <#/>Anyway 
now what do you do to them next <#/>Do you send them to school or what do you do in order to make them feel as part and parcel of the society 
\par <$B> <#/>Well there's a whole lot of issues <#/>The first and most important thing is all their basic needs are m
et here <#/>By basic needs I mean they have access to a <-/>a good toilet system <#/>They have access to good showers <#/>Some of them have access to lockers <#/>We're in the process of building more lockers more cupboards for the children to keep their c
lothes in <#/>When you think of how people get really angry when they give a child some clothes <#/>The child was on the streets and you see them throw away their old clothes and put on the new ones and just keep those old clothes away }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057  but then w
hen you think about it they threw them away because they have no place to keep them and here in Tanzania it's too hot to have two pairs of clothes on at the same time if you want to preserve them so what we are trying to provide each child with is a safe 
s
pace to keep their extra clothes some of their extra belongings because you need that if you want to survive on the streets uh <#/>More than that they have access to basic health services <#/>As you know health services are no longer free in Tanzania but 
s
treet children often don't have the money to access these services in the first place so what we are providing through help from UNICEF and uh uh a German group called Action Medior is we provide them with free medical services right here at our centre <#
/>There's an assistant medical officer who helps us with these issues 
\par <$C> <#/>Uh when I was walking around I met with }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  some of them and they said you just provide them with shelter but no food why is that so 
\par <$B> <#/>Okay that's always uh a big i
ssue <#/>A lot of people in the community have confronted us with about it uh <#/>The issue is this when we first started this work we did we didn't just start it by putting up a centre and deciding what was best for the children <#/>We talked with the ch
i
ldren <#/>We found out what was important in their lives and we also followed them around to find out how they were surviving and one of the <-/>the issues is street children are incredibly resilient they are incredibly creative about finding ways to surv
i
ve and one of the things we found out was each one has very legal jobs that they were doing to get food for themselves and our intention here at the centre is to build on what the children already know what the children are already doing rather than takin
g
 away all of what is important to them and <-/>and saying we know what is best for you <#/>We don't know what is best for the children <#/>The children themselves know what is best for them So they work in food stores They work selling uh chewing gum and 
s
weets <#/>They work at <-/>at making <O/> <#/>This is Mwanza <#/>We have a big lake so they are the ones who have fishing lines and go and fish because you can fish in <-/>in two hours you get enough fish to <-/>to get money for three <-_>for three<-/> go
o
d meals that particular day <#/>So they are doing very well on their own <#/>We do provide food for those who are very young <#/>We have children who're four years old five years old all the way to children who are about eight <#/>We provide food to all t
h
e children who are on medical care and we provide food for children who are on specific programmes like those who are going to school <#/>They get breakfast and lunch but they still have to after their homework they have to go out and work to get money fo
r their dinner uh <#/>Other than that what we try to do is make sure that the child is getting good nutritious meals wherever they're working 
\par <$C> <#/>Okay can you tell us uh how old is the youngest uh as well as the oldest one at the centre }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$
B> <#/>The youngest one as I said Hamisi is four years old <#/>He's been on the streets for about a year now uh <#/>The oldest one is fifteen and that's only because we have set a limit <#/>There are street youths we're working with that we have some kind
 of relationship with they are about uh twenty twenty-one and they go onwards because there are a lot of people who've been on the streets for a very long time but we work mainly with <./>four I mean with all children up to fifteen years of age 
\par <$C> <#/>uh you know Mustafa street children have already used }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  to go to roam about in town and uh sleeping <-_in><+_on> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
 the pavements now how did you manage to convince them to join you with the centre 
\par <$B> <#/>Uh it was actually quite easy because what we did was we worked in the streets ourselves <#/>Uh lots of people in town who knew we had been to university and we had studied thought we were crazy spending all our time on the streets sitting in the
 
hot sun on a pavement with the children but what we did was build relationships with the children showed them that we were there we were their friends and then we started talking with them getting to learn what was important to them so if they needed heal
t
h care we accompanied them to the government hospital uh <#/>For those who had been arrested under the hooliganism and vagrancy act and taken to prison we'd be there in the courts defending them <#/>So slowly they realised that we were with them we were s
u
pporting them and we wanted to work with them <#/>So up to now at this centre often people ask us how do you round up the children <#/>Well we don't round up the children <#/>The children come on their own <#/>They're free to leave when they want to and t
h
ey're free to come in when they want to <#/>New children aren't <#/>We don't go out on the streets looking for new children to pull in <#/>Other children who are already members of our programme when they see a new child on the streets will immediately sa
y look if you want a nice place to shower a nice place a warm place to sleep well why don't you come to <?/>Koleana and we\rquote 
ll get registered <#/>So the children themselves bring other children in <#/>That's what the name of our organization is all about as 
well <#/>We're called <?/>Koleana which means supporting one another nurturing one another and that is one thing that the <./>chi <-/>the street children have always had because they don't have adult supporters in this world they at least have }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  
support of each other <#/>Of course you see them fighting and doing things like that but ultimately they know they're in it together not with <#/>It's not the adults who are important it's <-/>it's each other that's most important 
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 <$C> <#/>Okay how are they progressing probably schoolwise or healthwise 
\par <$B> <#/>Okay their health has improved tremendously I mean you we can see a difference The children are growing far more than they used to uh There are less infections Of course still other tropical diseas
es invade as I said malaria is always a constant problem here But in terms of their own needs in terms of hope because often when you're on the streets you don't have much hope in terms of self-esteem there is tremendous improvement The children now have 
h
ope now before when I used to ask them where do you think you'll be three years from now they said I don't know or maybe in jail but now no now they say uh I'll be a mechanic or I'll be driving this bus and there's a popular bus with a video in town The s
c
hoolchildren are doing remarkably well Twelve children are going to school six of them placed in the top five of their classes in <-/>in the last term So they're doing amazingly well and uh let me just tell you one story that has affected me that shows a 
l
ot about what kinds of progress we've been able to make There's one child that was brought to us while we were working at home uh with a huge belly very thin uh very reticent and not willing to co-operate with anyone including the street children who had 
b
rought him in It turned out that he had a very long-term infection Everyone thought he was crazy he was dirty because he didn't wash but often not taking a bath not taking a shower not even jumping into the lake is an issue of self-esteem When children do
n
't care about themselves don't care about their bodies they don't shower uh What happened with <-/>with Fella we renamed him Fella his name is Felician but we renamed him Fella Fella was properly treated for all the infections he had He was severely malno
u
rished but slowly we began to add protein into his diet He's doing amazingly well He <-/>he <-/>he got a job as a domestic servant He's about seventeen now so he's as a domestic servant he worked for a while but he said no I'm tired of taking orders from 
people uh He hadn't talked for four years so he used to come at home <&/>}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 prep}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 at night just to talk with us and after two hours we said Fella can you stop talking now and he says no no no no no I have not <-_>I have not<-/> talked for the last five years an
d you can't shut me up now uh Well what Fella is doing now is he <-/>he sells uh groundnuts He has found a place where he about four hours drive from here where you can buy very good very popular groundnuts So he buys them but he doesn't buy them he doesn
'
t just go with money to buy these things he takes things that are used in that village uh which he knows are needed in that village like chewing gum Sweets sell at a very high price in that village So he goes sells it to all the store owners there and whe
n
 he's back he buys groundnuts from the money he makes there comes here sells the groundnuts at about five hundred per cent profit uh and he does so he's doing very well He's about in about I think in about three months' time Fella is going to go off the s
treets He's looking for a room right now and he's making enough money to afford three thousand shillings rent a month right now 
\par <$C> <#/>Uh that's a big achievement and uh I hope the centre can be a good example to others in the country because the problem
 of street children is not in Mwanza alone but it's a national problem and we need to do something for them Anyway we have heard also that the centre is conducting }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 AIDS programme now how do you go about to bring }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057  awareness to children about AIDS issues 
\par <$B> <#/>Okay our one of the primary focuses of our AIDS programme is working with young people involving them respecting their views and then building up on what their views already are uh But let me just talk since we've been talking
 about street children about what we do with our street children because in many ways they are most vulnerable to the HIV virus uh Life on the streets means that children become sexually active much earlier than <-/>than other children We have children wh
o
 are ten years old who are already sexually active Now that may shock some of you of the listeners here but it's just the reality that we're dealing with So what we do is <-/>is there's a very nice video developed by an organisation called Streetkids Inte
r
national called Karate Kids which has been uh <-_>which has been<-/> translated into Swahili extremely well using slang using street language and we show this video to them and after the video or during the video we stop it every once in a while and get t
h
em to talk about certain issues Now with the <-_>with the<-/> street children they also have their own language to talk about sex and what we have managed to do is after seven months of intensive work the children told us what the language is what words t
h
ey use to talk about sex and until we had that language they weren't responding very well So what we now do is talk with them about language about <-/>about how to <-_>how to<-/> avoid certain situations uh how to take care of each other how not to play s
e
x with someone who is not willing because that was happening quite a lot as well and what we're giving them is alternatives to sex as well We <-/>we when you're occupied a lot of this these issues were about not <./>hav having too much time to do lots of 
t
hings so you experimented When you have <-_>when you have<-/> any kind of sexual urges you want to explore them and there is no-one to tell you that this has to be explored in certain ways and not in others So what we do is talk with them A lot of it is j
u
st talking really we talk with them We discuss it often in groups of three or four and they tell us about some of their feelings and what it involves is unless you have a relationship where the child trusts you sees you as an adult but not like they see m
o
st parents where they're afraid to tell their parents certain issues where you have a relationship of openness sometimes I've discussed my own sexual life with them just so that they can talk with me about it and they don't feel like they're talking with 
someone who hasn\rquote t experienced anything or who doesn't understand what their needs are So I say no it's okay it's okay for you to have these feelings and then let's talk about how <-/>how to get around it 
\par <$C> <#/>And sometimes people believe that seminars and workshops can help Do you impart uh such knowledge to them using that method 
\par <$B> <#/>To some extent but as you can imagine seminars and workshops often go on for a long time I mean for <-/>for six hours seven hours eight hours Ask anyone who\rquote s been 
a parent that if they'll try to hold the <./>the attention of their child for over two hours and they'll tell you it's an extremely difficult job The group we work with is mostly eight to twelve years old and we work around their time not around our time 

\par <$C> <#/>How is their response <&/>}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 idiom}{\v\fs24\lang2057  when you bring such subjects before them 
\par <$B> <#/>It's good initially very shy I found that when there were women in the group and I'm talking with street boys no response When I have talked to street girls and I'm
 there no response So what we try to do is our women staff who've been trained by the by some of the people in our AIDS programme they work with the street girls and some of the men I have trained them so that they work with the street boys uh but to try 
to mix sexes and then you get very different responses }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$C> <#/>Uh some people also believe that the street children is an environmental problem What can you say about it 
\par <$B> <#/>Well uh they are an environmental problem Most people when they 
think of street children probably think of street children as being the problem and that they've been attracted by <-/>by an atmosphere of bright lights big city and come into the streets So often people when you talk with people they say there's a pull-f
a
ctor children are pulled onto into the cities but what we found out after we've talked with the children we've built up a relationship with them is children more often than not are pushed onto the streets and through our work we found out that there are s
e
veral related factors that push children onto the streets and it's <-/>it's <-/>it's the social environment that <-/>that <-/>that does that to them Poverty because we live in an extremely poor country poverty is always always always an underlying factor 
T
here's only one child out of the hundred and twenty we're working with right now who comes from a wealthy family The rest come from extremely poor backgrounds but the question to ask then is most people in Tanzania eighty per cent of the people are very p
o
or and their children aren't ending up on the streets A very small percentage of children in poor families are ending up in the streets so what are the factors in those families that are pushing the children onto the streets and we found out that violence
 
is a big big big issue for families that can't cope for families that often don't know how to be with children or families that are overwhelmed with lots of children The one way they cope the one way they the word used is discipline their children is by p
i
cking up a stick and beating the child and children will take it children have a very clear sense of justice They know what is right what is wrong and when they feel that their rights are being denied and it's going on for too long they will say <ea/>bas 
enough I'll try to make do of with my life on my own not with the support of adults 
\par <$C> <#/>Uh Mustafa we\rquote ve been talking much about your activities but mind you any success needs <-_>fund><+_funds> Who is funding you or is funding the centre to run all these activities for example the AIDS programme 
\par <$B> <#/>Right uh we have a whole bunch of funders uh A big chunk especially right in the beginning was the Mwanza community In very many ways people in the Mwanza community have been very responsive and ofte
n not directly they haven't given us cash but they've given us lots of things in kind clothes food uh marker pens colour pencils things that we need to run make keep the centre going We've also had people like the Catholic church provided us with personne
l
 for the first four months People we've taken on as full-time members later on when we had the funding but before the Catholic church paid for them for four months so we've had support like that from around the community uh but our primary funders now are
 UNICEF It\rquote 
s a <-_>is a<-/> big funder of both our children's programme and our AIDS programme uh <name/>NORAA the Norwegian Aid Agency is funding our children's programme to a <-_>to a<-/> big extent as well The <name/> fathers have also paid rents for us 
and helped us in building funds uh There's a group called EDF European Development Fund that is also helping us build a new centre bigger centre for the children There's another group called I mean the Irish Embassy is supporting our <-/>our work as well 
u
h The Ford foundation is helping in a big way with our AIDS programmes and then there's another Dutch group called HIVOS which is also providing quite a bit of help So we have a lot of people lot of good support lot of people from the community are coming
 together to fund us We don't we're not dependent on any single donor uh Rather we're working with a whole bunch of people a whole bunch of donor groups to support our activities 
\par <$C> <#/>Uh the way I can see Mwanza has many street children but for the time being you cannot accommodate all of them Now what are your future plans to enable the centre }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_to>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 accommodate as many street children as possible 
\par <$B> <#/>Well that's a tough one What we're hoping to do is uh maybe in the future have community centres
 throughout Mwanza where children who are on the edges of becoming street children can be accommodated can because my feeling is that more and more children will be coming from Mwanza municipality itself and if we have community centres in different neigh
b
ourhoods in Mwanza where before the children end up on the streets they can have an environment they can go to a place they can talk with someone who is <-_>who is<-/> an adult counsellor who can deal with some of the issues that are important to them uh 
I
 won't be I'll be honest with you and I don't think that we'll be able to manage to accommodate all the children Because of HIV uh because of AIDS already about half the children arriving at the centre at present you know the current figures are from fami
l
ies that have been affected by AIDS and our lowest projections show that by the year two thousand there'll be five thousand children on the streets of Mwanza <?/>Koleana alone is never going to be able to deal with this What it needs what the children the
m
selves talk about a lot is a united community effort to do this work and it shouldn't be expected like <-/>like it was expected in Nairobi that one organisation can handle the situation of children Even in Dar as Salaam right now there are seven organisat
ions working with street children and that's the kind of effort that would be needed <*e/>Koleana alone or the community alone or any other organisation alone will never be able to work with the children 
\par <$C> <#/>Uh you have been concentrating much <-_with><+_on> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\v\fs24\lang2057  the street children uh what about in the future would you think something about the other victims for example mixing with the orphans 
\par <$B> <#/>Well one of the issues I personally am very concerned about is <-/>is I think that the idea of 
child rights and how do you go about protecting a child a child's right for anything is not very well developed is People don't know how to go about it People don't know what exactly to do when we say a child's rights need to be defended When you ask some
o
ne what do you think a child's rights are even there you get very vague answers so my hope is that sometime in the future to be working with the whole a team of people throughout Tanzania where child rights is introduced in school curriculums Where I <-/>
I
 know it's I think it's <slang/>gonna be extremely difficult to involve adults into talking about child rights but if we can prepare our children to be more conscious about what their own rights are well <-/>well then my hope is that they will be able to 
h
elp they will be able to be better parents better caretakers of their own children So this whole issue of child rights I think needs to be explored much more needs to be discussed much more and people need to understand what the consequences of denying th
e child its rights are all about

}{\fs24 Welcome to the programme 
\par <$A> <#/>The centre was established in nineteen seventy-three being entrusted by }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24  the task of training rural medical aides to man our rural dispensaries }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
This particular centre recruits class seven leavers who receive a three-year course in various medical subjects }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 The Songea based Rural Medical Training Centre currently has a total
 of one hundred and seven students who are eager to finish their courses and work with the rural people }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
The centre's operations will come to light after talking with the centre's administration members of the staff and students }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 To set the pace in m
otion the centre's principle Dr <name/> summarises the <-/>the centre's activities and set-up
\par <$B> <#/>Uh this institution was uh <-_found><+_founded> in nineteen seventy-three uh by the following objectives training village health workers at a dispensary level }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Uh we have several departments in this training institution uh }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 To start with we have }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 principal's office which deals with the administration finance management students' curriculum implementation }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 We have the next <./>dep department which is uh }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 vice principal's office which is uh co-ordinating the studies which are uh uh running }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  around the <-/>the <-/>the institution throughout the <-/>the duration of uh <-_instructions><+_instruction> }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{
\fs24 Then we have the <./>st staff office }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Here is where the different tutors are uh supposed to meet and prepare for their lessons before they move to their classes }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
We have the finance office whereby the finance matters are being uh taken care of }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  and then w
e have others like typing pool stores and we have several drivers who all in all help us greatly to make uh to facilitate the activities which are going around }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24  in this institution }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Uh we have about as I have said already we have about one hundred and seven students uh uh }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 First years uh about thirty-seven students }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
We have uh thirty-eight students second year students and thirty-two students uh who are the finalists in this institution }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Uh the training course uh is of a three year period or three year instructional period uh }{
\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 We have first years uh <-/>second second year and third year }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
In the first year the students learn uh in the current first six months they learn English medical mathematics simple sciences including biology 
physics chemistry and patients' care uh just to make them become much more orientated to the language which they are going to uh uh <-/>to use most of the time when they go or they move into the next block }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
The second years this is the clinical year when uh different clinical subjects are being taught to them uh subjects like environmental sanitation communicable diseases pathology surgery }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Uh these are the key subjects together with the pharmacology which <-_is><+_are> the uh key subjects to make the
m clinically orientated so that they will go and uh help these people in the villages and we have uh after finishing after <-_>the a successful finishing of the training uh these students are supposed to be posted by the ministry to different uh regions i
n this country uh and therefore the ministry is responsible for posting them to different regions and especially at different villages to work as village health workers }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Thank you 
\par <$A> <#/>That was Dr <name/> the centre's principal }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 To follow in the 
footpaths of Dr <name/> the administrative structure now is the office of the vice principal Dr <name/> who's also the centre's academic officer who apart from his administrative duties and teaching also makes hospital rounds }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{
\fs24  to attend to the patients }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Our second step now is to know about the regulations of recruitment of students and academic aspects of the centre Dr <name/>
\par <$C> <#/>Well as a registered medical <./>off practitioner the regional medical officer of this region assigns to me some duties both in the hospital wards and in the different clinics just like other medical officers }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Uh in this school I'm the vice principal who assists the principal in all administrative duties and <-_take><+_takes> over the administration in the principal's absence }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
A vice principal is the chief academic officer so I have to study the school curriculum very effectively prepare all the class timetables allocate the teachers and tutors who come from in and outside the school <./>know as the known as 
part time teachers and tutors }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 I have always to see that weekly and monthly tests are conducted as planned }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
I also have to prepare all the student rosters which <-_assigns><+_assign> them some practical duties in the hospital wards and outpatient departments and also conduct all the tutorial sessions in the hospital }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
And also twice every year I have to move in }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24  the villages with the second and third year students to do a community survey prepare the community medicine rosters and then sup
ervise the maternal and child health clinics in the district health uh <-_>in the district health<-/> centres }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Uh sometimes I do face some problems particularly regarding transport uh fuel and the bad roads during the rainy seasons and sometimes shortage of food }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
And this always <?/>points to the students that uh they would complain to the school authority that the fuel allowances are insufficient }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Well uh even all these are like this the success has been so nice as uh forementioned }{
\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Thank you very much 
\par <$A> <#/>That was the vice principal of the training }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
In order to ensure that there is harmony between the administrators and students there is a bridge in between in the name of warden he is <ea/>Ndugu <name/> who painstakingly follows up all issues involved }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
How does he go about it <ea/>Ndugu <name/>
\par <$D> <#/>Well on my side as a warden uh there are some responsibilities which I actually uh they }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 My responsibility is uh are successful when I'm co-ordinating between the students and the 
<-/>the school administration or the institutional administration }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Now for better co-ordination between the staff and the students that means discipline is the paramount thing which should be observed }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{
\fs24 Now regarding discipline as such actually my duty is just to <-/>to <-/>to try and maintain and see that the students are they are in line with the school regulations uh as provided by the ministry }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
So in short we have <-_>we have<-/> <-_>we have<-/> some regulations which I can't mention all here }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
It might take too much time but just to <-/>to <-/>to <-/>to <-/>to point out some of the important disciplinary aspects is that we have to observe that uh students are within the school premises at defined times or that the students are fo
llowing the periods as co-ordinated by our institutional co-ordinator as well as the timing maybe for meals should be punctual in such a way that they don't interfere with the uh time allocated for different periods and then not forgetting again on the di
sciplinary aspect is that unless the students have no problems regarding maybe studies or regarding their welfare uh so we should expect that there might be some problems }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Now some of the problems could be uh maybe we could say <-_>we could<-/> tell }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24  as domestic problems }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Now these problems could be uh something to do with the meals It could be something to do with the health }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 It could be something to do with learning materials and even the security of the students }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
So in all these aspects there could crop some problems }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24  }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  and now how do I get }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24  these problems from the <-_>from the students<-/> }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Now we have the as in our government we have <O/> leaders but here we have leaders in each dormitory so they are t
he people who are actually to some extent they are vested with the responsibility to <-/>to keep some of the regulations going well and when they uh single out any problem the first person to <-/>to face is going to be the warden so actually I'm getting }
{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  the first hand information whenever possible }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 But as you know sometimes the information can skip }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24 
 me according to the <-_>according to the<-/> magnitude of the problem }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 So on those respect }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24  }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  there are some probl
ems which I can solve but if there are problems which are beyond my capability then I have to send these problems to the higher administrative organ }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Now }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>coughing}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 
there could be some disciplinary behaviour such as maybe a student is too late to come or to report }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 or maybe some students have slept out of the campus or maybe a student is not attending classes well or sometimes even the uh <-/>the meal regulations or timing is not observed }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 So all these problems they }{\b\v\fs24 
<&/>grammar}{\fs24  are first uh directed to me and I try to solve to my capacity }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 and then actually most of them would be uh solved and then there is the co-ordination between students and the staff and students and the other subordinates }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 That is again requires }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 the co-ordination of various jobs to these subordinates uh }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
That means I have to arrange the duties of maybe the drivers sometimes the duties for the cooks the duties for office attendance so that generally we have a calm and uh surrounding which is more or less in peace and maybe tranquillity so to say }{
\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Also there are health problems that means as a warden I have to produce a roster for our clinic }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 We have a clinic and then I have to produce a roster uh in which uh one doctor or a medical assi

Formerly I mentioned <-_about> people like <O/> leaders but other than those leaders from each do

to }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057 
 public its activities uh including the safe and <-_efficience><+_efficient> use of pesticides in Tanzania <#/>We therefore expect to broadcast uh this programme very soon uh in Radio Tanzania so that especially farmers will understand what uh
 we are doing at TPRI and lastly uh we disseminate such information through research findings<#/> Findings uh are published uh in various papers which uh such information }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 could be easily disseminated by uh say extension officers uh to the farmers in the rural areas 
\par <$B> <#/>Let us now go back to the registration process <#/>I would like you to give us more elaboration }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057 
 on how you make a follow-up to ensure that the registered pesticide which is intended for public use is the one which is imported 
\par <$A> <#/>On the <-_arrive><+_arrival> of uh imported pesticides uh TPRI staff uh usually conduct inspection and take samples say three to five for every twenty uh kilogram or twenty thousand uh litres depending on the type of packing and form
ulation uh <#/>The main purpose of taking samples is to perform analysis in order to verify }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  quality of the pesticides being imported in the country 
\par <$B> <#/>We have been talking about the TPRI and the farmer but what is the main relationship between uh TPRI and the farmer because TPRI is making a research }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057 
 on pesticides and the farmer is just a person who is cultivating the land <#/>Now what is the main relationship 
\par <$B> <#/>uh What Tropical Pesticides Research Institute that is TPRI doing }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 uh <#/>We are conducting research on different pesticides against uh economic pests uh <#/>The findings uh which we get through research findings uh are used as a guidel
ine to the farmers and actually uh the findings <-_indicates><+_indicate> which type of pesticides could be used to bring <-_a> significant or positive results against economic pests which we believe uh through such information the farmer can be uh can ge
t an advantage }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$B> <#/>Some pesticides <?/>flourines like sulphur which is mostly used by cashnut growers are said to have acid which is harmful <-_for><+_to> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
 the land <#/>What is your advice to the farmers <#/>Should they continue using it 
\par <$A> <#/>uh Yeah <#/>There are various reasons which can cause uh a pesticide to be harmful uh and one of <->it><+_them> uh for example if a pesticide is not used according to its direction <#/>We therefore expect that uh such kind }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 
<&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  of pesticides could bring harmful effects to uh the person who is using it and its environment <#/>Therefore before making any conclusion }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057  we need to make investigation }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057  whether what the farmer farmers uh uh the farmer\rquote s complaining is true 
uh <#/>In this way we will be in a better position to advise farmers <#/>Meanwhile farmers should seek advice through their relevant agricultural officers that is at regional and the district level uh in their respective regions 
\par <$B> <#/>uh Some people are complaining that pesticides affect the health of the farmers but whether we like it or not the pesticides will continue to be imported for public use <#/>Now what are your comments to <-/>to the clients 
\par <$A> <#/>Yeah <#/>You mean uh the advice to farmers on the safe use of pesticides in Tanzania 
\par <$B> <#/>Of course 
\par <$A> <#/>uh Okay farmers should be educated on different issues uh related to safe and efficience efficient use of pesticides in Tanzania through uh radio programmes <#/>As I have said before
 that TPRI uh uh has prepared a programme to explain to the public uh the kind of activities which occurred at TPRI and uh we expect that uh most farmers uh will get uh useful information and secondly uh such information could be disseminated to farmers t
h
rough TV <#/>For those who have TV and magazine seminars and uh conducting different courses <#/>As I have said before at TPRI uh we are conducting a pesticide a pest management course uh which was started in nineteen ninety-three <#/>The main purpose of 
uh this course is uh to inform pesticides\rquote  dealers uh on the safe and efficient use of pesticides uh in Tanzania and as I have mentioned before we expect that because pesticides\rquote  dealers they }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 usually uh have <-_a> contact with farmers through se
lling of their products sometimes in the rural area <#/>So we expect that they will be able to uh disseminate such information to farmers <#/>The things which they have learned from TPRI uh they'll be able to uh disseminate to farmers uh in the rural area
s <#/>And lastly I would like to say that the farmers should always seek advice uh <-_to><+_from> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
 experts or people who will assist them on the safe and efficient use of pesticides in Tanzania <#/>And also I would like <-_>I would like <-/>also to 
encourage farmers to use uh integrated pest management uh <#/>You see you cannot only depend on uh using pesticides to control uh pests uh <#/>Farmers should also use other uh ways of controlling pests such as <./>biolo biological means physical means and
 etcetera }{\v\fs24\lang2057 In this way uh I mean by using other uh uh control methods uh it will also uh assist in reducing the risks which are caused by the uh pesticides in Tanzania

<#/>Welcome once again to another edition of Women's Half Hour <#/>Today we bring you an interview with <ea/>Ndugu Chito Ram chairperson of the national committee on traditional practices affecting the health of women and children about female genital mut
ilation }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>music}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 
<#/>Female genital mutilation is one of the traditional practices which is said to affect the health of women and children <#/>Female genital mutilation is still practised in most African countries including Tanzania <#/>In this programme 
today are interviewed }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 <ea/>Ndugu Chito Ram chairperson of the national committee on traditional practices affecting the health of women and children <#/><ea/>Ndugu Chito will talk about among other issues measures taken by the committee to elim
inate female genital mutilation the recommendations made for female genital mutilation to enrich the African platform for action at the Dakar conference and how female genital mutilation affects a woman in terms of her welfare and development <#/>She begi
ns by telling us how is the situation }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  in Tanzania so far as regards female genital mutilation 
\par <$B> <#/>The situation of female genital mutilation in Tanzania uh is a bit bright in the sense that we have started to embark on the campaign against
 female genital mutilation in one region that is Dodoma region and in Tanzania out of the twenty-five regions twenty uh seven regions out of twenty mainland practise female genital mutilation <#/>This equals to thirty-three point three per cent of the pop
ulation <#/>so the situation we will call it bad }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 but not grave and uh fortunately we have received some funds from IWDA that is International Women Development Agency from Australia and we have started on the sensitisation project against female
 genital mutilation in Dodoma region which so far from last year nineteen ninety-four the situation }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 appears to be very encouraging in a sense that out of the four <-_district><+_districts> in Dodoma we have reached in those four districts forty
 villages that is ten <-_village><+_villages> in each district and then we have sensitised whom we call our focus group <-_discussant><+_discussants> or <-_facilitator><+_facilitators> and we have conducted seminars <-_to><+_for> }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{
\fs24  them and in }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24 
 the grassroot level <#/>so these people in return are sensitising their fellow villagers on the adverse effect of uh female genital mutilation uh <#/>As you are aware I'm we are calling it FGM because it's not circumcision <#/>A woman has not no organ 
to be circumcised except she's being mutilated 
\par <$A> <#/>uh <ea/>Mama Chito you <-_was><+_were> one among the participants at the Dakar conference and the FGM was one of the key issues which was discussed at length <#/>What can you say about the discussion
 <#/>Has it shown that FGM in Tanzania is a big problem compared to other African countries 
\par <$B> <#/>uh other African countries or you will find the whole population of that country is practising FGM <#/>So in Tanzania it's seven regions out of twenty so 
that is not a very bad situation indeed and uh in Tanzania they wait until the girl is about ten years old or after they have started their menstrual period whereas other countries in West Africa they }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 mutilate a baby a child when they are just 
one year old or two years old and that is most cruel <#/>It is cruel even to do it on a twelve-year-old child but it is worse when you do it on one and a half year child <#/>So our situation is not as bad as in other parts of Africa 
\par <$A> <#/>The problem is now on the increase and of course it needs immediate action to stop it <#/>So what <./>rec recommendations have you made to enrich the African platform for action which will be discussed in Beijing 
\par <$B> <#/>In Dakar we strongly uh condemned and recommended this horrendous and cruel practice should stop }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 as the government leaders or heads of state have <./>adher uh they should adhere to the convention of the right of the child and to the convention of uh human rights so as they have signed all 
those <-_convention><+_conventions> they should adhere to those <-_convention><+_conventions> and institute laws to prohibit this <-_>to prohibit this<-/> practice and also for those who violate this human <./>rig basic human right they should be punished
 
severely <#/>We said this practice is very dehumanising to women and when you dehumanise a person they feel they are worthless human beings or creatures they feel they have no use or purpose in this world therefore their role is to remain inferior <#/>so 
this we condemned in Dakar very much and we forwarded our areas of concern to be discussed at the Beijing meeting in September this year 
\par }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>music}{\b\fs24 
\par }{\fs24 <$A> <#/>The fifth African regional conference on women held in Dakar Senegal in the mid of November last yea
r revealed that some women in the West African states Sierra Leone in particular have now made female genital mutilation <-_as> a project to earn their daily bread <#/>What are <ea/>Ndugu Chito's opinions on this 
\par <$B> <#/>Well it is true in Tanzania also <#/>It is true in Tanzania also because those people who practise or who are the perpetrators of this FGM practice they }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 get a lot of money for doing one FGM <#/>For example in one village we were told the person gets up to ten thousand shilling
s for doing FGM on one child <#/>On top of that they will get a cow or a goat or chicken and many other <-_present><+_presents> flour maize flour or a sack of maize etcetera etcetera <#/>You name it they get it <#/>They're the most well-fed well-dressed a
nd to them this is an <-_economical><+_economic> trade or <-_economical><+_economic> venture <#/>So uh in our groups of <-_facilitator><+_facilitators> one was }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 FGM practitioner and she said now you people are going to make me very poor because I have got to lay down the tool and actually this lady her name is <name/> and she is in <name/> village in Dodoma she }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 was very open about it very positive about it <#/>She said I was doing it to other people's children but I didn't do it to my 
own children <#/>Neither will I ever do it to my own children but now she has vowed to work hand in hand with our national committee on traditional practice to work <-_against><+_towards> }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24 
 abolishing this terrible practice of mutilating young female girls 
\par <$A> <#/>Okay coming back to the African platform for action <#/>Now how the national committee on harmful practices will implement }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  what you have recommended on the African platform for action before the Beijing conference 

\par <$B> <#/>Ye
s another recommendation at Dakar was that every government should be asked to institute or enact a law to prohibit this practice <#/>so one way which we are going to work through is the Ministry of Health Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare and Youth a
n
d Ministry of Community Development Women and Children's <-_Affair><+_Affairs> including Ministry of Justice so that uh we can be instrumental in bringing this change in those harmful traditional practice because this is one of those harmful practices whi
ch needs to be abolished but we will preserve the beneficial traditional practices 
\par <$A> <#/>You have started with Dodoma alone <#/>Now what are your strategies to enable your service to or to extend your service to other centres the other seven regions 
\par <$
B> <#/>Our next strategy is to proceed to Singida region which also out of the three districts two <-_district><+_districts> practise this harmful practice of uh FGM namely Manyoni district including Itigi and all the suburbs around it Singida urban and S
ingida <./>rur rural <#/>It's only Iramba district which does not practise FGM <#/>So this is our next target 
\par <$A> <#/>I understand earlier you told us some of the measures which have been taken by the committee to eliminate the practice <#/>Has it been successful <-_to><+_in> }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24  those areas you introduced the project 
\par <$B> <#/>Yes we have made }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24  follow-up in all those villages where we <-/>we <-/>we spotted the facilitators and whom we <-/>we gave them }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  orientation <-_seminar><+_
seminars> by uh conducting role plays and community involvement <#/>So we made a follow-up and by asking first the community themselves whether these facilitators after their seminars they have done any job and even from a small child we were told }{
\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24 
 the facilitator has been very busy conducting meetings and condemning FGM practice <#/>So we feel that they are doing a very good job of advocacy for us and very good campaign against FGM in their area and also we went to the community and asked this sea
son has there been any circumcised child or circumcision ceremony which accompany}{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 this FGM practice <#/>They were all very scared and they <-_say><+_said> no because this facilitator is very aggressive and the village leadership or government of 
the village is very very strict <#/>If any parent is caught then they are taken to the local gathering there and they are either fined or they are even taken to the district courts <#/>So we feel that uh something is really being done not just through wor
ds but through deeds as well and it is through collaboration of the whole village leadership as well as district leadership 
\par <$A> <#/>And now tell us in brief how FGM affects a woman in terms of her welfare and development as well 
\par <$B> <#/>First of all there are uh immediate effects <#/>Then there are mid-term effects <#/>Then there are long-term effects <#/>The immediate effects is }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 profuse haemorrhage or excessive bleeding at the time when the cut is made to circumcise 
her or to mutilate her external genitalia <#/>By external genitalia what is being circumcised is the whole clitoris and the two labia minora so the girl can bleed profusely even she can faint or death could occur immediately and then oedema of the whole c
ircumcised or excised area until it obscures her <-/>her ability to urinate or to pass urine and then the bladder gets extended or distended and then she can't urinate then she gets infected and after that she can get very high fever etcetera <#/>Then }{
\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 mid-term effect is from that scarring tissue which <-/>which heals now there's a big fibrous or a big celloid <#/>A big celloid is a big scar like potato which forms on the genitalia and then it again obscures even her menstrual flow her urination a
nd uh when she grows up even coitus with the spouse or the husband will be very painful and very difficult for her <#/>Now the long-term effect when she now <-_conceive><+_conceives> during labour this scarring tissue will be so hard and it won't give way
 by stretching as <-/>as the vulva does uh under normal circumstances during labour so the baby's head is delayed to be delivered }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 and she keeps on pushing she gets herself exhausted until she may have a very bad uh vaginal and <?/>perennial tear
 which can extend up to the anus and then cause many many other <-_manifestation><+_manifestations> like uh what we call <O/> vaginal fistula or recto-vaginal fistula whereby the <-/>the tear has extended from }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 vagina urinary tract up to the ana
l tract so the urine and faeces will be mixing together and this is a very very painful and traamatic experience both physically and mentally and the healing also is very painful because they may have to undergo operations about two operations or three op
e
rations in order to <-/>to cure this condition completely or sometimes they never get uh cured completely So here the mother is affected and the unborn baby is also affected <#/>The baby may get brain damage <#/>By getting the brain damage the baby will b
e born mentally retarded or even get a dead baby }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  So the baby can be still-born as we call it or a dead baby on hand so these are all disastrous to the mother 
\par <$A> <#/>uh some people say that the female genital mutilation can also lead to divorce <#/>Is that not a loss on part of a life 
\par <$B> <#/>Well it is because when one gets married the objective is to lead a happy normal everlasting life not to end in uh divorce or disaster like that <#/>So it is very traumatic psychologically socially sexua
lly and uh from any aspect of uh one's normal life it is disastrous 
\par <$A> <#/>uh <ea/>Mama Chito I'm also interested to know how you approach the women the <ea/>njakangas those old <ea/>bibis who are supposed to <-/>to mutilate our young girls <#/>I think it is difficult to convince them to stop the practice isn't it 

\par <X_>}{\v\fs24 <$B> <#/>Yes in our long term project or plan we had decided after we got the follow-up evaluation that uh the next seminar will include traditional birth attendants traditional healers and th
ese so-called <ea/>njakangas or circumcisers of female genital mutilation so that we put them all in <-/>in one table on one table }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>idiom}{\v\fs24 
 discuss fully and make them aware of the prevailing problems regarding their trade and the hazard it poses on the health of women and children as a whole 
\par <$A> <#/>uh What are your views in general to the government or to the ladies the old <ea/>bibis who are still practising the female genital mutilation 
\par <$B> <#/>At the moments we should join hands This is a communit
y problem therefore it should be tackled first from the within the community itself then the region and then nationally we should really join hands and support the effort of this committee so that we don't continue violating the basic human rights neither
 
the <-/>the <-/>the convention of the <-_right><+_rights> of the children because if we have signed at international level then we should adhere to this pledge and promise and be in the forefront of implementing proper human rights and convention of the c
hild uh of the <-_right><+_rights> of the child

\par }{\fs24 <I> <$A> <#/>In this week's programme we carry an interview with Mr Ladislaus Salema the general manager of the National Engineering
 Company NECO and also President of the Institution of Engineers in Tanzania <#/>In this conversation with Radio Tanzania's Eda Sanga Mr Salema dwells on a wide range of activities related to the National Engineering Company the engineering profession in 
Tanzania and its contribution to the national economy
\par <$B> <#/>uh The National Engineering Company sometimes referred as NECO was established in July nineteen sixty-seven uh as a result of nationalisation of a business formerly owned by a Dutch company know
n shortly as TOM <#/>Now TOM owned a machine shop and a foundry and TOM was engaged basically in uh repair of uh various pieces of equipment from the industrial sector mostly from the sisal industries <#/>So after nationalisation in nineteen sixty-nine th
e
 TOM business was also amalgamated with <name/> who was basically engaged in steel construction So the National Engineering Company of today has uh three main activities <#/>It has a steel fabrication and erection section a machine shop and a foundry <#/>
N
ow in the steel fabrication we are mostly engaged in the production of uh fuel storage tanks building of depots construction of steel bridges trusses grain girders and various other steel fabrications <#/>In the machine shop we are involved with machining
 
various components for industrial spare parts and some components that are required in our own constructions particularly of uh the fuel storage facilities <#/>Uh In the foundry we have a foundry equipped with <O/> and <O/> furnace <#/>We are able to prod
uce cast iron castings steel castings and <O/> castings <#/>Now we produce parts that are required in the industry as spare parts but sometimes as components for }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 assembly of new products and we undertake repair services uh parts that are require
d to be reconditioned particularly for motor vehicles in our machine shop <#/>So in short those are many areas of our <O/> and as to how relevant they are to the country economy <#/>I don't need to emphasise that fuel storage and distribution is very very
 
important to the functioning of our economy and the NECO is the biggest key-player in Tanzania in as far as construction and storage facilities are concerned <#/>And we do produce spare parts for instance for a ginnery which are used for the ginning of co
tton We do produce spare parts for the sugar mills <#/>We do produce components sometimes even for the breweries
\par <$C> <#/>Taking into account that this company started immediately after the nationalisation process in nineteen sixty-seven and looking at where we are now uh would you say the company is operating to its set aims and objectives
\par <$B> <#/>uh After nationalisation what was inherited was basically all the pieces of equipment and there has been rehabilitation particularly in}{\b\fs24  }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24  nineteen seve
nty-nine and eighty-two period in the steel shops and in the foundry and the capacity of steel fabrication was then raised considerably so that to date we are able to fabricate on a single-shift basis up to one thousand two hundred pounds a year <Our fabr
i
cators of steel <#/>And with the recent investment on the induction furnace we can comfortably produce about a thousand pounds of castings a year <#/>Now this <-/>this makes NECO foundry one of the biggest <#/>This makes our steel fabrication section one 
of the biggest in the country <#/>And uh there has been a gradual replacement of some pieces of equipment also in the machine shop but we still are really short of the <./>man many equipment }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 that we require to be more competitive particularly in
 the now unfolding market situation particularly in the machining area <#/>But we are confident that we will be able to uh make these investments in the future and we are confident that we shall be able to grow <#/>We have been operating on profit since n
ineteen seventy-six to date and we have been in the competitive market <O/> another time when Tanzania was only }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 planned economy we were competing with even external firms so we are confident that the National Engineering Company should be able t
o survive <#/>We are also looking ahead towards maybe some kind of co-operation with people or firms with higher technology levels so that we can move in new products
\par <$C> <#/>Would you know how big your staff is and how much is local and how much is uh maybe foreign
\par <$B> <#/>Well we are about three hundred and fifty people uh with about twenty-four engineers and uh we are all local all Tanzanians <#/>We've had <-_an> assistance from Germany since nineteen seventy-five to nineteen ninety }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{
\fs24  <#/>We 
have had uh this assistance starting with eleven expatriates in <./>vari various areas of engineering and management uh reduced gradually to about three in nineteen ninety and then it phased out completely <#/>So now we are hundred per cent local and we a
re managing
\par <$C> <#/>Do you have a working relationship with the Engineering Faculty of the University of Dar es Salaam
\par <$B> <#/>Yes yes we work <-_>we work<-/> quite closely with the Engineering Faculty in the sense that we do send our people to consult th
e experts there sometimes <#/>We also have a kind of programme going on with experts in production particularly of castings in the foundry who come to advise us on how to improve our quality and on }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 personal basis we know most of the professors and senior lecturers in the university so we have this kind of interaction uh even on }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24  personal basis
\par <$C> <#/>Since you are the biggest in the country and in your capacity as President of the Institution of Engineers in Tanzania there has been 
of late some discontentment on the part of the public on the performance of engineers in Tanzania <#/>Would you have any comment
\par <$B> <#/>uh I <-/>I would <-_>I would say<-/> <-_>I would<-/> say the public is justified to be to feel concerned <-_>to feel concerned<-/> <-_of><+_about> }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24 
 the performance of the engineers in the country but I would hasten to add that the public has not been fully informed and we are trying now in our <-_>in our<-/> engineering promotion activities to get the public infor
med of the role of engineers in Tanzania uh what they have done and what is happening because basically the discontent you might be now hearing about is uh on the road construction and uh most of it most of this is not really done by local engineers <#/>M
o
st of this is done by foreign firms or locally registered firms but which are not really local in nature <#/>And we have also discussed this as an institution with the Minister of Works for instance trying to see how we can <./>up upgrade the locally regi
s
tered contractors for instance so that they can improve their performance to avoid this uh discontent from the public which in my opinion is quite fair <#/>The public has a right to <-/>to <-/>to demand to get uh <-_>to get<-/> the service that they are r
eally paying for
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24 <$C> <#/>In terms of uh training Mr Salema how would you say your company fairs?
\par }{\b\v\fs24 <&/> break in recording
\par }{\v\fs24 <$B> <#/>... craftmen for our vocational school training and we give them in-house training on the job This normally would range for a 
period of about three years and from that usually they turn out to be quite good craftmen Now for the professionals the professional people we give them in-house training but we also uh sponsor them for further training outside sometimes postgraduate work
 sometimes study tours sometimes very specifically tailored programme for a specific work like we have been sending people to Germany...
\par }{\b\v\fs24 <&/> break in recording
\par }{\v\fs24 ...acceptable so they could perform independently in the economy And we have realised this in th
e board in the Institution of Tanzania and in the board recession board and we are trying to come up with a programme where a crash programme will be created to train most of the people so that they can reach the necessary level of professional competence
 And I'm pleased that the World bank has accepted to finance this programme and we hope it will start early next year
\par <$A> <#/>That was Mr Ladislaus Salema the general manager of the National Engineering Company NECO and also President of the Institution of
 Engineers in Tanzania talking about his company the engineering profession in Tanzania and its contribution to the national economy He was interviewed by Eda Sanga of Radio Tanzania
\par <$A> <#/>This is Investment and Trade in Tanzania In this week's programme we bring you the second and last instalment of the interview with Mr Ladislaus Salema who is the general manger of the National Engineering Company NECO and also the President of t
h
e Institution of Engineers in Tanzania The last programme as you may remember dwelt on a wide range of activities related to NECO and the engineering profession in Tanzania Today general manager Ladislaus Salema talks about the problem of maintaining engi
neers in Tanzania He talks with our reporter Eda Sanga }{\fs24 </X>}{\v\fs24 
\par }{\fs24 <$C> <#/>Would you say you're facing problems of maintaining the engineers that you have you trained you know those who go for greener pastures elsewhere
\par <$B> <#/>Well occasionally <-/>occasionally we 
will have somebody wanting to change a job basically because of better <-_remunerations><+_remuneration> elsewhere uh but I would say the situation in the national engineering is stable uh because <-/>because I think there is more job content more enginee
r
ing in NECO and it's more satisfying too if one is really intending to develop a career in engineering it's more satisfying to work uh for an engineering firm for an engineer instead of just running out to some people who might pay you better but not give
 
you very very good challenging jobs <#/>But on the whole engineers in this country are not as well paid as they should be <#/>In fact I should say they are <-_>they are<-/> not even considered along with other professionals <#/>Well I don't want to compla
i
n about doctors getting better pay than engineers but I thought when the government was considering professionals like doctors they should <./>re actually think of engineers because no other profession and I repeat no other profession can operate without 
engineers
\par <$B> <#/>In terms of uh spare parts uh Mr Salema how did you come to innovate the department of making of spare parts so that the country at one point is self-sustaining instead of using foreign exchange to import these spare parts
\par <$C> <#/>Now spare part production spare part production or component production I would say isn't }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 very very old thing in the country and many many companies have started by A getting a component a broken component or one-out component and trying to copy it a
nd then produce one and try to fit it and this has been quite difficult <#/>In fact it is the wrong way of doing it <#/>The right way of doing it would be to get a drawing an engineering drawing from the designer with all the specifications including mate
r
ial specification and then produce according to the specifications <#/>That way is a <-/>a better way a surer way of making sure that you produce the right part <#/>But you see as you know most of the equipment in this country is very old and even when it
'
s new drawings are not normally made available <#/>We import a lot of machines to this country but nobody has ever demanded that as part of the supply contract drawings should be supplied for spare parts <#/>So people have been importing equipment  and th
e
 only thing they have managed to have is a manual for parts so they <-_>so they<-/> could continue to order <#/>Now we have international company attempted to make spare parts using <O/> metals copying the sample where when they are available using the dr
a
wings or where a new sample is available taking the new sample for user drawing and use the drawing <-_>and use the drawing>-/> for producing the parts and sometimes even reuse the drawing on a repetitive order <#/>But I must <-_>I must<-/> say that uh th
e
 country as a whole the production of components of spare parts is still a long long way towards fulfilling the demand for there isn't that information of the spares that are required <#/>It's simply not available <#/>People talk about we need spare parts
 
but if you ask them do you have the drawing which are the spare parts you want what are the material specifications they wouldn't know they wouldn't know so it's quite difficult it's quite difficult to really go fully into the import substitution for spar
e parts in the country in the near future 
\par <$C> <#/>uh Talking about these components and spare parts how is the market system }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>idiom}{\fs24  because uh one of the complaint has always been that when you buy a locally made component or spare part it is sometimes
 more expensive than the one that has been imported from abroad
\par <$B> <#/>It <-/>it could actually be true but it could also be untrue <#/>A bit true because if you are ordering a casting and you only want one piece or two pieces the cost of producing these
 two pieces is certainly going to be very high because the process is the same as if you order a thousand pieces <#/>So because you have to make a pattern you have to make a mould uh you'll have to make a drawing maybe the process is the same for one part
 
as it is for one thousand parts <#/>So if you had large quantities the price is going to be low and uh if we had if a certain optimum quantity is ordered the prices local prices are usually very low in comparison with imports uh <#/>On the question of qua
l
ity it could also be true but it could also be untrue <#/>If <-/>if the order did specify the specifications were given on the material and the dimensions were correctly given I see no problem in one producing <-_casting><+_castings> particularly the simp
l
e <-_casting><+_castings> like cast iron or steel castings to the required specification and dimensions uh the <->the I'm saying I've started by saying it could be true and it could be untrue <#/>It could be untrue in the sense that people get used to imp
o
rting spare parts People have been importing spare parts since the beginning of time in this country and people are reluctant to change <#/>People won't accept this change <#/>So people would still want to go back to their old suppliers <#/>The suppliers 
who have been selling are pressurising to sell so it's easy to jump by and say look we don't want the spare parts because they are poor quality and we should import but }{\b\fs24 <+_with>}{\fs24 
 a number of <-_profession><+_professions> we have established that local some local spare parts are even of higher quality than some imported spare parts
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24 <$C> <#/>Apart from the many problems that you have already given out }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\v\fs24  uh what other problems are there and what would you suggest the government does so as to alleviate t
hese problems and also to make you work more efficiently 
\par <$B> <#/>You see Tanzanian has a very very small industrial sector whichis not integrated at all and we will have a lot of problems We'll have to live with the problems for a long time until we deve
lop a well integrated industrial sector and this will take us a lot of time and in this I would really recommend that the government has to play a leading role A to create an industrial policy B to supervise the <-/>the implementation of this policy on a 
l
ong term basis I <-/>I don't subscribe to the idea that the government should now pull out and become a referee I'd rather say the government should be a coach The government should train the players and be a coach and maybe referee but <-/>but not just b
e a referee on the side because nobody is going to invest in certain areas of metal industry and uh here I refer to }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\v\fs24  engineering industry Now in }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\v\fs24 
 engineering industry the gestation period is long the investments require large investments and uh only governments or such bodies would be able to raise that  kind of resources in that <-/>that sector of the economy }{\fs24 </X></I>

<I> <$A> <#/>This is Face the Mike and welcome to the programme <#/>Many people including Tanzanians are perhaps unfamiliar with Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology a public organ which was established by the Tanzania Commissi
on for Science and Technology Act Number Seven of nineteen eighty-six <#/>Formally known as the Tanzania National Scientific Research Council this parastatal organisation effectively and efficiently co-ordinates and promotes scientific research and techno
l
ogy development in Tanzania and also acts as chief advisor to government on science and technology policy and on all matters pertaining to the development of science and technology in their application to social economic development in the country <#/>Wit
h
 this background in mind why a commission for science and technology Why is this discipline key to the development of any nation <#/>These are but a few of the many questions I asked the Director General of Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology P
rofessor Abdul Rachman Salim Msangi <#/>But first why is science and technology so important in the development of mankind
\par <$B> <#/>The wealth and the development of a nation is much more dependent on the level and application of science and technology in t
hat country and that is why today we find that the rich and developed countries of the world are not those with rich natural resources but those with a very high level of science and technology development <#/>A typical example is uh if we compare say our
 
country Tanzania and Japan <#/>From the natural resources point of view Tanzania is very much richer than Japan in almost all aspects of natural resources agricultural and mineral uh water resources and so on but it's everybody's knowledge that Japan is a
 much more developed country today than Tanzania and the simple reason is that <./>Japane Japan is very much more advanced scientifically and technologically than Tanzania
\par <$A> <#/>Then what efforts has Tanzania done }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057  in ensuring that science and 
technology receives the attention it deserves <#/>Do you think that these efforts are adequate If not what do you think should be done to improve the situation
\par <$B> <#/>Well Tanzania uh compared to other <./> develop developing countries in Africa I think 
can be said to be putting a reasonable effort in the development and application of science and technology as an important means for socio-economic development <#/>Uh I wouldn't say that the effort is adequate because we are very far behind when we are co
m
pared to well other newly developed countries or countries which are generally grouped as developing like ourselves uh like Korea uh India and such like countries South American <-_country><+_countries> like Brazil <#/>These are grouped with us as develop
i
ng countries but they're far more advanced than us because their science and technology capability is more advanced than ours uh <#/>The uh awareness of the importance of science and technology uh as a means for socio-economic development in Tanzania uh b
e
gan only about uh two decades ago <#/>The both the Organisation of African Unity OAU and also the United Nations in various fora during the past two decades have been emphasising the need for countries to devote a reasonable amount of their financial reso
u
rces towards the development of science and technology in the form of science and technology education in the form of scientific and technological uh research institutions and also in the application of scientific research to economic development activiti
es <#/>Uh currently Tanzania is spending just about zero point five per cent of its gross <-_natural><+_national> product <-_towards><+_on> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
 the development of science and technology and this is far less than was recommended a decade ago in nineteen
-eighty by the Lagos plan of action which uh agreed that member countries of the OAU should as soon as possible provide for at least one per cent of the GNP towards the development of science and technology and Tanzania was a signatory to this agreement <
#
/>So the pith of it is that more than a decade later well we still haven't achieved even half of that target <#/>So this is the situation at present Tanzania amongst other developing countries of Sub-Saharan Africa is still lagging far behind the <./>deca
d the <-/>the <-/>the target that was recommended by the Organisation of African Unity and by the United Nations uh Conference on Science and Technology for Development
\par <$A> <#/>And uh what is the problem apart from the fact that we don't have the resources What other problems are there
\par <$B> <#/>Well the other <./>pro uh resources themselves in the way of say finance is not adequate <#/>You have to have uh adequate <./>man scientific and technological manpower and this manpower can only be generated from uni
versity institutions and the university institutions are supported by the school uh uh the <-/>the school programmes so that uh a balanced science and technology development in the country requires first that we have you have good a very good school syste
m right from the primary through the secondary to the tertiary level so that your scientific manpower }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057 
 very strong background in science and technology <#/>Now in almost all these levels we need to pull up our socks very much <#/>Uh at present time }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>idiom}{\fs24\lang2057 
 we have something like I think a hundred fifty to two hundred scientists and technologists per one million of the population and the target set by the United Nations is that you can only have meaningful science and technology development in th
e country if you have something like two hundred thousand scientists and technologists to one million of the population <#/>So we have a very long way to go
\par <$A> <#/>Would that be the reason maybe why the government at last in the nineteen nineties has decided to amalgamate higher education with science and technology
\par <$B> <#/>Yes I think this is one of the main reasons uh <#/>The creation of a Ministry of Science Technology and Higher Education is in fact a response <-_to><+_of> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  government <-_of><+_to> }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
 a recommendation that was made by the Tanzania scientific and technological uh community in a national workshop that was held in Arusha in eighteen in nineteen eighty-five which recommended among other things that in order to enhance the dev
elopment and application of science and technology in the country it was necessary even though the workshop realised at that time that uh the country was facing several uh problems economic development problems but still thought that science and technolog
y
 was so vital was such a vital factor a vital stimulus in the development of science and technology that uh even though the situation was not so favourable in the country it was necessary for such a ministry to be created <#/>So the Tanzania science and t
echnology uh community are very grateful very appreciative to }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  government that at last it has heeded to }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\b\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 this uh recommendation
\par <$A> <#/>Normally as a rule uh science subjects in schools maybe beginning from secondary level up to higher level is considered }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 to be a dull subject is considered to be difficult and people many people actually students don't want to associate themselves with the subject <#/>As a result maybe uh we've performed poorly in this area <#/>Is there a way t
hat uh the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology could come up with innovative ways of teaching this subject so that it is interesting and attracts more students
\par <$B> <#/>Yes as a matter of fact we are already doing something in that direction in 
that we uh sponsor uh school science competitions through the Tanzania uh Science Teachers Association <#/>They hold uh exhibitions annually for secondary schools whereby the secondary school students uh display their capability in uh scientific subjects 
u
h all scientific subjects biology chemistry physics mathematics uh and we help them in giving prizes to the winners <#/>This has been a very great stimulus to the uh <./>cult uh developing of interest in science uh in <./>second <-/>in secondary schools u
h
 <#/>Recently also we've been uh co-operating with uh uh what they call science camps <#/>This is an activity that was recently developed by the University of Dar es Salaam whereby they go out into the country and hold camps for primary schools secondary 
s
chools whereby they do various scientific activities uh it could be collecting materials from the environment from the land from the sea and examining these under the microscopes and trying to relate how these organisms that they've collected uh grw and h
ow they are adapted to the environment from which they were collected
\par <$A> <#/>Now I also understand that uh our country has already evolved a national science and technology policy <#/>Could you elaborate and highlight on }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  this policy
\par <$B> <#/>Yeah
 uh the science and technology policy I think was uh passed in nineteen uh <./>work worked out in nineteen eighty-five and was uh uh incorporated into the national economic development policy in the following year <#/>With the <-/>the uh <-/>the policy si
m
ply says that in view of the fact that socio-economic development is dependent on the application of science and technology that all uh national economic development plans should include a chapter on science and technology as a support base <#/>Uh if we t
a
ke for example the uh policy on agricultural development then we all know that in so far as the current national economic development plan is concerned agriculture is given the highest priority I think rightly so <#/>It allocates I think thirty per cent o
f
 the GNP and uh the <./>sci we uh the scientific and economical community of the country are saying in order to make that policy meaningful we must also say that the bulk of science and technology research and development effort should be equally uh biase
d
 <#/>That is to say the bulk of it the bulk of research and development activities should also go the lion share should go to agricultural production <#/>Uh that is to say research aimed at enhancing agricultural production Industry and energy I think is 
the next one and uh twenty per cent or so and we are saying the same that that is to say that the national economic development plan should be parallel to the national science and technology policy
\par <$A> <#/>Now as a nation I'm sure you'll agree with me Professor Msangi that uh we don't have a culture such that uh takes us uh to be }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>idiom}{\fs24\lang2057 
 in harmony with science and technology <#/>Now as the Director General of the institution that has been charged with the responsibility of promoting science and technolog
y in the country and facilitating the evolution of a science and technology culture in the general public can you explain how you're going to carry out these functions
\par <B> <#/>Well first of all uh the development uh of <-/>of science and technology the in 
the uh national institutions like I said before we try to influence the science and technology activities in schools uh in universities we as I said <-/>we helped finance science uh and technology shows for schools or science camps uh uh <#/>In the uh gen
e
ral population we have as one of those activities that are aimed to encourage and help to develop a science and technology culture in the general population we annually uh try to identify amongst the <-_Tanzania><+_Tanzanian> population at all levels peop
l
e who have indicated uh that they have a capability in science and technology uh <#/>It might be ordinary people who <-/>who <-/> whohave who are innovative who have devised uh mechanisms of or <-/>or <-/>or devices appliances for easing say human labour 
u
h appliances for replacing imported uh products and when we recognise such talents we encourage them to develop by uh providing a reward to the innovators <#/>So we give what uh <-/>what we call uh <./>Ta Tanzania Award for Scientific and Technological Ac
h
ievement <#/>If we can uh <-_>we can<-/> <-_>we can<-/> uh if we get a person in <-/>in even uh a lay person who has made some uh appreciable innovation we recommend these people for the award and this award is given uh on May Day the first of May each ye
ar by the President of the United Republic and this is how we encourage uh the development of science and technology culture in the community
\par <$A> <#/>Uh but there are some people again from the public who complain that uh awards to these uh people who have
 made some innovations simply end up as awards <#/>You don't hear a much about them later on as a way of follow-up whether they've done something more uh I mean some advancement to where they were uh whether whatever technology they have put <-_in><+_on> 
}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
 the market is appropriate whether they are finding any problems as far as marketing is concerned whether information is trickling down to the people who need that technology <#/>What do you have to say about this
\par <$B> <#/>Well it's not very easy it's not so easy for a theoretical model to be put into practice <X_> }{\v\fs24\lang2057 
It takes time but we're doing something about that uh You probably remember that about two years ago or two or three years ago one of the people who received 
the TAST award in this country <./>wa was a person who had innovated a wooden duplicating machine a duplicating machine which was almost entirely made of wood and which would be very useful in outer districts the people or country uh schools in the countr
y
 where they don't have electricity and so on and when we recommended this innovator and he got an award It was somebody from Ifunda Technical College and we have since that time being trying to commercialise that <-/>that kind of duplicating machine and w
e
 are working with uh our collaborators <O/> in Norway and this uh wooden duplicating machine is being developed and we hope that in a few years it <-/>it will be possible to have it in the shops and to have it in <-/>in schools and uh in offices uh in <-/
>in the district in the rural areas
\par <$A> <#/>I'm also personally interested in knowing whether you have any uh thoughts about putting solar energy <-_into><+_to> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\v\fs24\lang2057  use in this country
\par <$B> <#/>Oh yes that <-/>that is one of our future activities We'r
e very interested not only in solar energy but in the whole group of new uh sources of energy new and renewable sources of energy which include solar wind the geothermal and such like Uh we have a field station uh uh a station rural energy project which i
s
 based in Dodoma and it's our intention to expand this uh Currently it's mainly uh centred on the application of biogas the use of biogas uh in <-/>in rural communities and I think you've heard a lot about it uh uh People who keep cattle they can use the 
c
ow dung to generate uh biogas which can be used for lighting and for cooking Now we uh as you know Dodoma is an area where they get a lot of sunshine and also the wind and uh in the neighbourhood you also have geothermal and our intention is to develop th
at into an important uh new and renewable energy centre which will deal with uh solar uh wind uh geothermal and will continue with also <-/>with the <-_>with the<-/> biogas
\par <$A> <#/>Well Professor the world through science and technology is increasingly bec
oming one and Tanzania is lagging behind in science and technology as we've already discovered uh well and that is compared to other developing countries What steps is the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology going to take in order for us to ben
efit from other countries that are better off in the field
\par <$B> <#/>We are taking various steps in that direction Uh first starting nearer home we have uh standing agreements with uh our neighbours uh Kenya and Uganda uh which as you remember were partner s
tates in the former East African Community We uh have agreed that we should uh share our experiences and co-operate in the development of science and technology in the various sectors of the economy uh and taking advantage of the former co-operation that 
w
e had under the East African Community Uh or example we have agreed that uh in the area of public health uh because we have common problems in public health I mean malaria is uh number one problem both in <-/>in the three countries and we have agreed that
 
in so far as research on the control and uh cure of malaria uh should be co-ordinated so that uh we do not uh duplicate the efforts of one another uh so we have charted out a programme whereby we can share the various uh uh tasks in <-/>in research in mal
a
ria and uh every so often say once in two years we meet and exchange ideas uh and <./>exchan exchange experience uh We can also exchange scientists Now in so far as the African region is concerned we have standing agreements with certain countries for sha
r
ing experience We have standing agreements with uh uh coastal states uh in <-/>in Eastern Africa in what we call uh North and Western Indian Ocean whereby we co-operate in research in marine resources with Somalia Kenya uh Mozambique uh Seychelles and Mau
r
itius Uh in the South so far as the South is concerned that is in the <./>oth uh in the sector of developing countries we have the South Commission which is <-_>which is<-/> very well known and we are very active participants in the South Commission There
 
have been very far-reaching recommendations made by the South Commission as to how the South could co-operate in utilising science and technology as fully so as to try and catch up with the North uh We are thinking of co-operative arrangements with countr
i
es like Brazil with India uh and also with uh uh Korea So far as uh the North is concerned the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology has uh standing arrangements and agreements with various agencies from developed countries including Scandinavian
 countries For example we have uh }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 standing agreement with uh uh Swedish Agency for Research Co-operation or SAREC with Norwegian Agency for Research Co-operation NOAREC We have standing agreements with uh IDRC with Canada that is International D
evelopment Research Centre uh We have standing agreements with the we are and we're active members of the Commonwealth Science Council which is based in London and which brings together all the Commonwealth countries uh in a co-operative effort in science
 and technology And we also are active members and benefit from uh the services of such international organisations as uh UNESCO FAO UNIDO and such like uh Right at present time }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>idiom}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 we are working out at a <-/>a co-operative project uh in establishing
 a centre for technology transfer which would help very much in the industrialisation of this country Uh we're working uh on a co-operative project with uh UNIDO uh in this regard and we have many other such co-operative efforts uh At the non-governmental
 
level as you know uh recently uh we have participated and this country has established uh an international science and technology village uh as a non-governmental science and technology development organisation and we are active participants in this <-/>t
his uh we have recommended and we hope this <-_is> recommendation is going to be taken seriously that the international science and technology village should be recognised by the South as one of the twenty centres of excellence
\par <$A> <#/>The Director General
 of Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology Professor Abdul Rachman Salim Msangi telling us about the functions of the Commission for Science and Technology its constraints and bottlenecks as well as its international linkages He also hinted about

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <$A> <#/>This is Face the Mike and facing the mike today is Professor L K Shayo International Village for Science and Technology Project Co
-ordinator <#/>Perhaps to begin our discussion Professor you could tell us why International Village for Science and Technology in this country
\par <$B> <#/>Well uh I think this village has come about as a result of our experiences over several years uh and es
pecially our experiences uh in the in our participation uh in the activities of the International <./>vil International Centre for Theoretical Physics which is in Triest <#/>Uh We have proved beyond doubt that uh when a scientist or a technologist or in f
a
ct any thinker gets a place where he or she can concentrate the results of such concentration are really very encouraging uh <#/>Our experiences show that whereas for example we have been teaching in the University of Dar es Salaam for uh a long time and 
e
ven if you take the <./>exp <-/>the uh experiences of other scientists who've been teaching in African universities you find that a lot of the work they have done in research a <-/>lok of a lot of the breakthroughs have been done outside in an environment
 which is conducive to discovery and innovation <#/>And the idea of creating this village is precisely to <./>cu to provide such an environment to our scientists and technologists
\par <$A> <#/>Perhaps you could uh give us some more insights as to what is the environment like
\par <$B> <#/>Uh maybe very briefly the village is uh one could imagine a village to be uh a botanical garden a very large botanical garden <#/>Inside of that garden will be various institutions <#/>Uh there will be two types of institutions one 
is a tiny wing of the village which will be composed of uh schools uh for talented children and innovators <#/>Then there'll be the research's wing which will be uh aimed at those people who have already completed their training and they are uh maybe doin
g
 they're working in various institutions like the universities or research institutions and they will be coming to the village to do research in the various research centres <#/>Uh there will be research centres in all disciplines of science and technolog
y
 uh maybe not a <O/> as I've said uh I could mention just a few <#/>There will be an international uh centre for physics chemistry biology biotechnology uh an international centre for science equipment <#/>There will be an international centre for A-scien
c
es and uh for mathematical sciences <#/>Uh these are just some of the few centres which will be in the village And each of these centres will actually be uh in a mini forest <#/>When you are in any one of these centres it will be completely isolated from 
the rest in terms of uh you'll not be able to see the other centres when you are in any one of the <-_>any one of the<-/> centres
\par <$A> <#/>Uh I'm just wondering why you decided to call it international village and maybe not international centre
\par <$B> <#/>Wel
l uh it's because it's a village <#/>I mean the way <-_>the way<-/> it is uh envisaged is to be a village <#/>It's a village of centres <#/>Okay <#/>The <./>int the <-/>the village is going to be a village of international centres <#/>So that's basically 
why we call it international village but maybe let me say the word international is there because this village is going to be uh open to all peoples of the world I mean specifically from Africa but really it is open to everybody
\par <$A> <#/>So you are giving me the impression that the village has not as yet started operating
\par <$B> <#/>Uh well it has started operating in a sense because uh over the last uh four years we've been mounting international workshops at the University of Dar es Salaam as preliminary act
ivities to the <-/>the village <#/>Uh we have for example uh already located the uh physical <-/>physical space for the <-_>for the<-/> village <#/>We have also uh some offices at the International Conference Centre in Arusha for the village <#/>So really
 it has started but of course we have to start uh in phases and what we are doing now is really to set up the infrastructure to get ready to continue with our activities
\par <$A> <#/>Uh now since you began some four years back what are the hitches some of the hitches that you have uh encountered
\par <$B> <#/>Uh by hitches you mean uh setbacks or
\par <$A> <#/>Yeah constraints
\par <$B> <#/>constraints
\par <$A> <#/>Yeah
\par <$B> <#/>Of course there have been several constraints because uh the first constraint really has been uh a cons
traint in our <-/>our desire to build a village in people's minds first because uh we <-/>we were really struggling to build this village in the people's minds so that we can get the necessary support <#/>Uh of course we have been using Radio Tanzania and
 the newspapers and giving uh various public lectures here and there uh but still we <-/>we are really <-_>we are really<-/> not we've really not managed to reach everybody and I think even a programme like this one is one of those
\par <$A> <#/>Uh yeah well I u
nderstand that uh in Tanzania we have a lot of research institutions and uh technology programmes or projects going on <#/>How are you going I mean as International Village for Science and Technology how are you going to complement efforts with these rese
arch institutions in the country so that there is no uh duplication of efforts
\par <$B> <#/>Uh the village is going to provide what <-/>what cannot be provided under the existing infrastructure <#/>Uh we don't have an infrastructure at the present that can prov
ide a person with uh a continuous uninterrupted period of concentration <#/>Uh you see I <-/>I <-/>I <./>wi <-/>I normally compare research and innovation to uh the process of <-/>of <-/>of <-/>of drilling for oil I mean when you drill for oil or even if 
<
-/>if you drill for water uh you find that the <-/>the <-/>the deeper you drill the harder it gets but then you but you have to dig deep enough to actually get the oil or the water <#/>So we <-/>we are in a situation whereby the environment which we live 
i
n does not really allow for deep digging in terms of innovation <#/>Uh therefore the village will provide really what cannot be provided by the existing infrastructure not only in Tanzania but the <-/>the whole of Africa I believe <#/>So that's one way an
d
 uh we are going to complement the efforts of these institutions by providing a place where the visitors and the scientists and technologists in these institutions can actually visit the village for extended periods of say one month three months six month
s
 to complete whatever they may have been they may have started wherever they are <#/>Uh I can give an example for example a professor in the University of Dar es Salaam or Sokoine University of Agriculture who has <./>dev has an idea or who has uh done so
m
ething but he needs a period of uh an uninterrupted period of time <#/>He can come to the village to complete whatever he's done uh <#/>In order to ensure that we don't have duplication we have uh we <-/>we <-/>we really uh <-/>i <-/>i involved the <-/>th
e
 institutions of higher learning in the in writing of the memorandum in the course of the association of the village which is really the constitution that guides the village <#/>Uh In our membership the University of Dar es Salaam is a member of the villa
g
e <#/>The Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology the Sokoine University of Agriculture there they were they are members of the village and this was done deliberately in order to make sure that there is no duplication <#/>That is the objectives of 
t
he village do not duplicate the objectives of these institutions And all along we <-/>we <-/>we intend to uh operate with uh to incorporate all institutions which are dealing with research and innovation in this country uh <#/>The Tanzania the <-/>the Min
i
stry of Science and Technology uh Science Technology and Higher Education will also be involved In fact we have also we have talked to the <-_>to the<-/> minister and the he is fully in support of the initiative <#/>Uh in short really we are trying to ens
ure that we don't duplicate the efforts of the institutions rather we complement those efforts in that we try to make uh whatever those institutions were created for be realised in more concrete terms
\par <$A> <#/>Do you have uh specific policies that will govern the running and operation of the International Village for Science and Technology
\par <$B> <#/>Uh maybe if you elaborate by policies what do you mean
\par <$A> <#/>I mean uh whether you're going to be a non-governmental or you're going to be a department within the Ministry of Higher Education and Science and Technology
\par <$B> <#/>Well uh the village has been registered as a non-governmental international organisation uh <#/>That
 was necessary because there's no way you're going to have an international organisation as <./>par as a department of a ministry or a department of any institution in a country uh <#/>That was necessary also in order to make sure that the village can act
u
ally uh have minimum bureaucracy uh <#/>Really bureaucracy is one of the things which really make people unable to move <#/>Uh maybe if I elaborate there <#/>It is our feeling that if for example a scientist were to make an innovation in the village that 
maybe gives the village ten million US dollars <#/>Well the village wouldn't mind to give }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 the guy maybe even a million dollars <#/>I mean there's no <-_>there's no<-/> doubt about it <#/>But I think if you are in a bureaucratic institution or if
 you are a department of a ministry or a department of uh another institution I think such things may not be possible because of bureaucracy uh <#/>Our aim is to make sure that a scientist or a technologist when he <-_come><+_comes> or she comes to the vi
l
lage he or she is completely free uh in terms of his brain is completely free to discover and is not impeded by anything at all <#/>This is really our <-/>our ultimate goal <#/>And I think this is the <-_>this is the<-/> environment which our counterparts
 in developed countries are having }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  uh <#/>People in Japan in United States in Britain they're having }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 the scientists there <#/>They have these environments and that's why they are making a lot of discoveries uh <#/>And when our people
 go there they also make breakthroughs <#/>In fact some of them when they go there to do their PhDs they get <-/>they <-/>they do better than their counterparts there but only when they come back home when I mean home I don't mean just Tanzania but all ov
e
r the Third World when they go back home they find that they cannot continue this research or even if they continue they really don't make the breakthroughs which their counterparts who completed their <-/>their studies abroad with them uh do <#/>So the p
o
int of departure is after completing our studies <#/>Otherwise as far as the brains are concerned I think each country has its own uh <-_>its own<-/> uh brains it has its own uh uh talents <#/>I think the <-/>the if <-/>if for example one were to do a <./
>statistic a statistical analysis of the distribution of talents on earth I'm sure one would really <./>gi find that the distribution is the same <#/>But then the point of departure is after finishing training
\par <$A> <#/>You mentioned uh innovators and uh discoverers performing better in uh other environments I mean other than in Tanzania
\par <$B> <#/>Or in Africa
\par <$A> <#/>Okay in Africa uh <#/>In your International Village for Science and Technology how are you going to motivate these uh innovators and discoverer
s because past experience has shown that uh these people end up getting the prizes and then you don't hear anything else about them
\par <$B> <#/>Uh I think uh <./>tha that's one of the problems we want to solve because giving a person a prize by itself does not really uh I mean that's a temporary thing uh with <-/>with us we are having }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 the continuity that the village is always there and whenever you've something to discover you are invited to the village <#/>So that the <-/>the innovator even if the
 innovator gets a <-/>a reward for a discovery today he knows he can go there tomorrow and do the same and get the same uh <-_>the same<-/> <-_>the same<-/> uh uh reward I think the problem of giving a prize for a single invention and forgetting is uh it 
i
s uh I think it <-/>it cannot be avoided so long as we continue with uh the <-/>the present situation uh the <#/>What I'm saying is that the scientist or the technologist will know that there is a place where I can go and bang my head and uh I <./>wha I'l
l be rewarded accordingly uh because really uh of course innovations uh an innovation <-_depend><+_depends> <#/>There are uh innovations which are not uh <-_>are not<-/> marketable but really if you can do an innovation }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{
\fs24\lang2057  that is marketable you should be able to rely on that innovation for the rest of your life <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
uh So I <-/>I think the motivation is going to come out of giving a reward that is commensurate with the innovation and making the village available to the scientist or to the technologist Mi
nd you in order to come to the village you don't have to innovate first I mean you all <-_what><+_that> you need is to say you have something to do and then you'll be invited to the village And while you're at the village our aim is to take care of you co
m
pletely while you are there Of course if you come for one time and you play around surely you won't you will not have a chance to come again And because you know that you won't have a chance to come again if you play around then you'll be serious and when
 you are serious you'll always get out something That's what I believe 
\par <$A> <#/>Okay and uh where are you going to get uh funds to ascertain that the scientists and the technologists are comfortable when they come for their uh researches and whatever
\par <$B> 
<#/>Initially uh in the beginning there's going to be some problem in funds fund-raising We are trying to get funds from the business community governments and non-governmental organisations etcetera uh these <./>in <-/>these are in terms of donations So 
i
nitially the village will have to be uh depend on donations It will have to be created out of donations but we are building within the village a certain element of self-reliance That is we <-/>we would like the village to be generating funds out of its ac
tivities as time passes by so that eventually of course one would be would like to be completely self-reliant uh So I <-/>I say initially we shall depend on donations and grants and so on but later on we expect the village will be self-reliant
\par <$A> <#/>You 
told me earlier on in our conversation that you are going to motivate uh a participatory approach because you believe it's the people who can give you uh moral support or whatever I'm interested to know more Are you talking about normal ordinary people or
 are you talking about researchers scientists and technologists and all those people who are in one way or another interested in the cause
\par <$B> <#/>I think I mean everybody uh Let me tell you uh in the beginning uh last year it was last year we received a <
-_donations><+_donation> of six thousand shillings from the <name/> the people's <O/> Dar es Salaam Now really this was very encouraging six thousand from people whose <-/>whose incomes are so low. Uh We also have received a donation from Abdul Mwalim gav
e
 his <./>donati first donation of one million shillings uh His Excellency <./>pres uh President Ali Hassan Mwinyi has given one million shillings We are really talking about assistance or concern of everybody uh There's no discrimination whatsoever in thi
s issue
\par <$A> <#/>And you also uh want to make the children participate How are you going to do this
\par <$B> <#/>Uh maybe let me uh extend this not to just children but uh for example school <-/>school children We've <-/>we received a donation of ten thousand s
hillings from <name/> girls uh these are uh young girls with no income uh We <-/>we <-/>we are going to have participation of children in the village uh in the village primary school of talents There's going to be a primary school which will admit only ta
l
ented children Uh we are <-_>we are<-/> embarking on a study that will give us a report on how do you identify a talented child under the environment of the village in the cities in <-/>in Africa for example Once we identify these people we would like the
m
 to join the village primary school where they will be given uh education in uh modern terms They will be given their education in an environment that is similar to what other children of that calibre of that uh level of that uh ability uh get in <-/>in <
-/>in <-/>in developed countries The aim here is to really see how we can develop whether we can develop our talents to the level of uh comparable to that in the US or Japan or so So that we really can get the best out of our brains
\par <$A> <#/>From your experience is a scientist born or developed
\par <$B> <#/>I would say both A scientist is born and developed because uh if you have a talented child who is not developed surely there is no way You have to give the child uh the ability or the environment to develop S
o the scientist is born and developed In fact uh I can tell you that most of the children we see play around in the streets some of them could have been geniuses But then they didn't get the opportunity
\par <$A> <#/>That's why I asked the question because look
ing at the schools that are in the villages even if the teachers wanted to teach them science in innovative ways they wouldn't because they don't have the tools they don't have laboratories Maybe they don't even have the competent teachers to teach the su
bject
\par <$B> <#/>Right
\par <$A> <#/>Uh in such a case don't you feel that we might be leaving out talented kids right in the rural areas of Tanzania simply because they don't have the opportunity to show what they can do
\par <$B> <#/>Uh actually what you are saying you are really in uh one way or another justifying the village because the aim of the village is to actually go to the village and try to find out }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 the talents and give them the necessary the training uh Of course the village will have its primary s
chool but the programmes of the village will be available too They will be disseminated to other schools The problem here is really that of ability If for example our country was rich enough it would have provided uh the all the facilities to all the scho
o
ls But given that we are not rich then we have one option either to say that we don't develop any talents at all and therefore give uh some type of education that does not develop talents at all and then we remain where we are forever or we say that we gi
v
e we identify <-_certains><+_certain> real talents and provide them with uh some <-/>some uh I mean groom them so that they become the leaders of science and technology of <-/>of this country in the years to come Uh we have that <./>dou that double choice
 and that's in given the circumstances I would say that we have an obligation at least to develop a few talents who will show us the way uh in the future
\par <$A> <#/>Now on uh fifteenth of February nineteen ninety-one Professor I understand you are holding a meeting Perhaps you could tell us what the meeting is all about and what its aim and objective is
\par <$B> <#/>Yeah uh okay since uh since Mwalimu uh became the patron of the village that is in May nineteen eighty-nine on the sixth of May nineteen eighty-nine u
h we have had a number of people really volunteers who have participated in one way or another in promoting this initiative the village initiative uh notably all the members who served on the uh the village provisional council or the members who served on
 
the secretariat on the scientific board and uh all the subscribers who signed the memorandum in that course of a session of the village and therefore enabled it to be registered Now these people have done this job purely on a voluntary basis because we re
a
lly have no employees up to now I mean we <-/>we I mean people are working on voluntary basis And we thought that it is time now that we meet our patron and uh and receive his challenges get challenges from him and words of wisdom because we think that we
 
need such challenge in order to move ahead This is really the purpose of the meeting tomorrow But we have taken this opportunity uh considering the position of Mwalimu and his leadership and his reputation in the world and so on We have taken this uh uh o
pportunity to invite uh a number of people from the public and private sector and the government uh so that uh they can listen to Mwalimu and actually also hear more about this village So this is really the objective of the meeting tomorrow
\par <$A> <#/>And uh as uh project co-ordinator Is this supposed to be a full-time job for you
\par <$B> <#/>Nope I'm having all my full-time responsibilities at the University of Dar es Salaam I have classes to teach This is purely uh something I do outside my normal working hours In fact uh
\par <$A> <#/>How do you balance your time then
\par <$B> <#/>Well sometimes we have to work to work to work up to midnight and beyond midnight in order to achieve this and sometimes you have got to work all night Uh I don't think there is another way on
e could have done this if not by really stretching oneself and uh in fact not myself but there are quite a number of other people who uh devote their time uh to <-/>to <-/>to do something for the village
\par <$A> <#/>Well you've decided to come up with such a 
project at a time when I believe the times are really hard for Tanzania economically and uh I dare say even politically and uh the twenty-first century is just a few years away Uh what challenges do you see coming up for the International Village for Scie
nce and Technology in rendering the best of services for the people of Tanzania
\par <$B> <#/>The many people of Tanzania and the people of Africa let me say the following that uh the we okay we <-/>we said time is we are in a difficult time economically I agree
 uh but as Mwalimu said some time ago I remember listening to one of his speeches he said uh you should not consume your seeds I mean if you have seeds to plant you should not just eat that seed because you are hungry because it means then and he fears th
a
t you'll die you have nothing to eat uh We have a challenge here I think as a nation we have a challenge uh to decide whether to really tighten our belts and uh build something like this that will really uh take us to the twenty-first century or we simply
 
say we are poor and this and <-/>and just don't do much I mean uh the success of this village depends to a large extent on the commitment of every Tanzanian uh Some time ago I did a calculation and say and found out that if every Tanzanian were to give us
 
two kilograms of sugar per year we shall really build this village with very fast And if when the village is built if we were to get about half a KG of sugar from every Tanzanian every programme of the village will run Now if one tells me now this is too 
m
uch for <-/>for a Tanzanian uh to commit to science and technology and to the future generation of Tanzania and Africa in general I really don't agree Uh again let me say we are poor but when you read in our newspapers of how much money is squandered in t
e
rms of being lost and being stolen and so on and being misused then this question of being poor again I <-/>I question it I think we <-/>we are poor but uh sometimes we tend to <-/overstretch> ourselves uh There is uh <-_>there is<-/> uh a UNESCO recommen
d
ation which uh also is made in the uh report of the South Commission for every country to commit at least one <-/>one per cent of the GNP to science and technology and I think this is a very small figure uh Some countries are committing up to three per ce
n
t Now when we say we are poor and we cannot do such things I wonder what we mean uh This is really relative <-_>is really relative<-/> and I think we have a moral obligation to <-/>to <-/>to give some funds to <-/>to such an initiative uh despite the fact
 that we are poor and so on But it is our moral <?/>base to the future generation of <-/>of <-/>of Tanzania and Africa in general
\par <$A> <#/>Well Professor you talk about uh commitment from members of the public I have a feeling this commitment will be terrib
ly lacking unless you give them an educational package why they should be committed to the international village for science and technology In the first place I am just wondering how many people at village level know of the existence of this village and w
hat benefits they could accrue from such a project
\par <$B> <#/>Uh I think I agree with you uh and that's why I said in the beginning that we <-/>we really wish <-/>wish to build this village in people's minds first before building it on the ground Uh this is t
he what we <-/>we <-/>we is the challenge before us and we are going to take it up and try to make sure that everybody as many people as possible hear of the village and have a chance to make a <./>cor to <-/>to contribute ideas on the village
\par <$A> <#/>Well thank you very much This has been uh Face the Mike and we had Professor L K Shayo who is International Village for Science and Technology Project Co-ordinator }{\fs24\lang2057 </X></I>

\par <I> <$A> <#/>However up to the end of nineteen eighty-one the plant was administered by both the Ministry of health and National Chemical Industrie
s so as to facilitate the smooth transfer <#/>This event marked the beginning of the plant as a parastatal conducted <O/> on a commercial basis rather than a non-profit service
\par <$B> <#/>Now in a nutshell <name/> how many divisions are there within the administrative network of the company
\par <$A> <#/>Well we have first we have the production department I mean <#/>We have the production department <#/>Well we have two divisions the tabletting divisions and the divisions concerned with the production of infusion
s <#/>Also we have uh the administrative administration department <#/>We also have the commercial department <#/>We have uh accountancy department and uh lastly uh we have the technical department
\par <$B> <#/>uh So you are the head of infusions division and what is it all about
\par <$A> <#/>Well the infusions division as such is concerned with the preparation of sterile products these being the intravenous fluids or in other words they are known as infusions <#/>These are solutions which are <-/>inde injected dir
ectly into a vein and therefore the solution is introduced directly into the <-/>bood blood stream uh <#/>The large whole of injections often called infusions or rather the intravenous <-_fluid><+_fluids> they are frequently needed to replace body fluids 
lost from circulation as a result of shock or severe burns vomiting diarrhoea haemorrhage and other certain diseases
\par <$B> <#/>uh Well uh I'm a bit swayed by the application of technical terms I can say uh but uh uh learning from what you have told us is that you\rquote re dealing with infusions 
\par <$A> <#/>yes
\par <$B> <#/>uh and that means uh as you <-/>you called them intravenous fluids uh would you take us to the process uh which necessitates the manufacturing of such fluids I mean the materials you use 
\par <$A> <#/>Wwell as I already said that these products are sterile products so in fact even uh the process of manufacturing these fluids they\rquote re a bit complicated
\par <$B> <#/><-/>mhm <-/>mhm 
\par <$A> <#/>We need uh qualified personnel who are really much committed to their work and uh the environment <./>which where we are working has to be very clean and to allow as minimum as possible the inclusion of other let\rquote 
s say bacteria or dust particles and so on 
\par <$B> <#/>uh and where do you get the raw materials
\par <$A> <#/>Usually the raw materials are all imported with exception of water }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 
which is our main uh uh <#/>I mean the major quantity of the uh I mean the product itself is water <#/>Apart from that the rest of the raw materials are imported <#/>We get them from diffe
rent countries from mostly from Netherlands uh from France from uh and some other few countries I can say
\par <$B> <#/>You have just referred to uh clean working conditions and uh you said that uh that is generally meant for limiting bacteria uh <#/>Can you sa
y how <#/>Can you tell us how uh such things like <./>en <-/>like <-_bacterias><+_bacteria> can be limited from uh from affecting your <./>y <./>aff affecting the materials that you produce
\par <$A> <#/>Well first of all we must have a minimum number of people working in that area 
\par <$B> <#/><-/>mhm
\par <$A> <#/>You know the area must be very cleaned thoroughly cleaned throughout the working I mean throughout the working time so even the personnel themselves have to be very clean and the materials we are using the u
tensils we are using have to be very clean and usually the room which we use for the preparations <#/>I mean the atmosphere has been sterilised by using ultra-violet light which we switch on overnight so at least we find that the bacteria is minimised in 
<./>th <-/>in those areas 
\par <$B> <#/>And uh would do you elaborate a bit on the sections in which uh the material passes before you get the final products
\par <$A> <#/>Oh well we have uh three main sections in our production area <#/>We have the preparation sect
ion <#/>We have the clarity section and also the packing section <#/>The preparation section uh deals with distillation of water <#/>We have double distilled water <#/>This is uh also one of the main steps we are taking in ensuring that the product is uh 
uh at least sterile 
\par <$B> <#/><-/>mhm
\par <$A> <#/>distillation of water I mean uh the water is being heated by steam 
\par <$B> <#/><-/>mhm
\par <$A> <#/>and uh the condensed steam is then uh re-distilled so at least the water we are using is double distilled water and 
before using it we have to make sure that uh it is maintained at high temperatures not uh so as to avoid growth of bacteria it is not less than eighty degrees centigrade and uh before using this water for the preparation we have another department the qua
l
ity control department which deals with ensuring that uh this <-/> this water is fit for the preparation of some of our products and uh preparation section deals with the mixing of the products <#/>I mean all the ingredients together with the water <#/>Se
c
ond we have the clarity section <#/>This is really concerned with uh clarity of the product because this solution has to be clear and colourless <#/>The third station is packing where the finished product after being filled into the bottles it has to be l
abelled well-labelled and packed <#/>So there are the three main sections we have in our division 
\par <$B> <#/>and what are the packaging materials <#/>You mean only bottles
\par <$A> <#/>Well for the time being we used to have glass bottles but due to <./>mhm many disadvantages we have opted for using uh plastic bags <#/>They\rquote re of uh certain quality known as polypropylene so we use polypropylene bags 
\par <$B> <#/>And for somebody who is a layman like myself when you refer to such a term as <#/>What did you term it }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>laughter }{\b\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <$A> <#/><./>Poly <./>poly <#/>It's polypropylene the bags <#/>A certain material of plastic anyway which can resist high temperatures because before I mean after filling the solution to the bottles
\par <$B> <#/><-/>mhm
\par <$A> <#/>in order to <./>ass <-/>to ensure that this bottle is sterile it has to be sterilised so you have machines used for the sterilising of these products <#/>The bags are then subjected to very high temperatures and pressure so as to at least to kill
 
all the bacteria which might have been introduced <#/>Now these plastic bags at least they can withstand that high temperature because the sterilising temperature is one and a half hours at two hundred and twenty centigrade so at least the material of the
se bags they can withstand }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  such high temperatures 
\par <$B> <#/>And uh after packing has been performed what is the next <./>de destination of the product 
\par <$A> <#/>Well after being packed this product is being sent to the storage department where i
t is kept under <./>quan quarantine because there are other tests which <-_has><+_have> to be performed by the quality control department before this product is released for use <#/>So the quality control department has again to ensure that this product i
s
 sterile and fit for use <#/>So what it does is that it has to do some tests analysis to make sure that uh this product has got the active ingredient it is supposed to have and also to perform the sterility test to make sure that there are no bacteria ins
ide <#/>So after these tests have been performed and they found that they qualify to the <./>go <-_>to the<-/> specifications then this product is then released for sale 
\par <$B> <#/>So you mean the quality control department is within the uh production division or how are they related in fact 
\par <$A> <#/>Well in fact two divisions they are related I mean the I mean the departments of production together with the quality control department <#/>They\rquote re two different departments but they\rquote re all related
\par <$B> <#/><-/>mhm <-/>mhm
\par <$A> <#/>so wherever we produce this is starting from the raw materials the quality control department is concerned to make sure that this raw material is fit for the preparation of these pharmaceuticals and at the same time during the differe
nt stages of preparation the quality control department also has to ensure that uh this product has more than normal qualifications all the specified qualifications before we proceed to another step <#/>So <./>inp so wherever the other areas let\rquote 
s say perh
aps doing the weighing there must be some small areas maybe in the weight so the quality control department is concerned about the quantity or the percentage content of the ingredients we are using so at least it will notify us that either we have to add 
some more or else we'll have to add some more water or some more of the salt before filling of the <-_>of the<-/> product 
\par <$B> <#/>And <name/> head of the infusion divisions <name/> Pharmaceutical Industries uh limited uh you have uh told us uh more about 
uh how you <-/>you produce the materials you call I mean the products you call infusions <#/>Now uh one would also like to know uh what are the qualifications before one is considered to join your division for that matter 
\par <$A> <#/>Well uh as a pharmaceuti
cal industry at least we would prefer that all who are working in this area or in this place have to have basic knowledge in pharmaceuticals <#/>The head of the division like myself I have to be <-_>I have to be<-/> a pharmacist 
\par <$B> <#/>by profession
\par <$A> <#/>by profession <#/>So myself I\rquote m a pharmacist and I\rquote 
m <O/> pharmacist and uh there is also one pharmaceutical assistant who is at least working under me and in my absence he can head the division <#/>The main qualifications of other staff is that they
 have at least to have Form Four education uh <./>preferring preference with uh science subjects and uh these have to undergo some in-plant training of pharmaceutical production so these are usually called production assistants and uh where with these we 
have other production attendants who are usually concerned with the packing section so at least in the preparation section the staff has <-/>has to be they all have to be production assistants with minimum qualifications of Form Four education
\par <$B> <#/>And how does the production pattern look like <#/>I mean uh do you produce against customers\rquote  orders or uh you <-/>you <./>pro produce enough stocks for <-/>for future orders or something like that
\par <$A> <#/>Well we produce these according to the national demand but unfortunately we can\rquote t meet the demand cause of other small problems
\par <$B> <#/><-/>mhm which are the <./>po problems
\par <$A> <#/>Well the main problems we are facing in the division for the time being is uh sometimes that we have a need of raw materials 
\par <$B> <#/><-/>mhm
\par <$A> <#/>Secondly the machines <#/>Of course all the machines are also imported so sometimes little frequent breakdowns of the machines we are stuck and we produce uh lower quantity of products than expected <#/>Thirdly we have other prob
lems such as water cuts and electricity fluctuations which are very common here nowadays so that these are the main <./>produc uh <-/>main problems we are facing in the division 
\par <$B> <#/>Yeah how is generally the impact of the shortage of raw materials as a problem Is it affecting you so much to an extent that you <-/>you find it quite painful I can say }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$A> <#/>Really but uh fortunately for the last uh two years we haven\rquote t faced the problem of raw materials
\par <$B> <#/><-/>mhm
\par <$A> <#/>yeah but the main problem in the meantime is electricity fluctuations and uh the breakdown of the machines whereby we have to also <-/>to import the spare parts some of them which may not be available here }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{
\fs24\lang2057  so <O/> we are forced to stop production but uh not quite <#/>I can say we haven\rquote 
t stopped <./>comp I mean production completely unless there are there is no electricity but we have uh very competent personnel in the technical department
\par <$B> <#/><-/>mhm
\par <$A> <#/>who are usually doing their best so as uh not to allow the frequent <./>mach machine breakdown to stop the production 
\par <$B> <#/>And what about water <#/>You mean you don\rquote t have a reserve tank 
\par <$A> <#/>We do have but sometimes we also use water for the production of steam I mean uh water is not enough <#/>We need plenty of water for the washing and also as a raw material for the production
\par <$B> <#/>And how do you generally tackle the problem of electricity <#/>Maybe you have a generator machine something like that
\par <$A> <#/><-/>mhm Well we haven\rquote t uh yet had a standby generator so these uh electricity cuts and electricity fluctuations they really do affect us a lot in the production <#/>We don\rquote 
t have any alternative but uh we now have another new unit whereby we have proposed to have a standby generator in case of these
\par <$B> <#/><-/>mhm <-/>mhm 
\par <$A> <#/>electricity fluctuations
\par <$B> <#/><-/>mhm <-/>mhm is a timely move
\par <$A> <#/>yeah
\par <$B> <#/>yeah and one wonders also how you go about uh delegating tasks to the staff under you <#/>How is the process
\par <$A> <#/>Do you mean yes we have uh three as I've already said we have three different sections in the division <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 and we also have the daily production target so starting from the preparation section those who are concerned with the d
istillation of water they know how much bags }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 have to be produced per day so from that they know how much water has to be distilled for this particular day so even for those who are in the preparation section they know how much they have to prep
are so <./>the obviously they know how much they have to weigh how much have to be mixed and how much how many bags have to be filled so this is uh how we are working in each department and also in the let\rquote 
s say packing section they also know how much how 
many bags have been produced so they prepare themselves for the quantity of boxes they need to pack their labels and all the necessary facilities they need for the packing of that amount of uh those this amount of bags being produced
\par <$B> <#/>yeah I unders
tand that you are not dealing directly with the production of tablets but uh probably you know something which uh would be of uh particular benefit to our listeners at this time uh I mean the process whereby tablets are also produced 
\par <$A> <#/>yeah In the tablets division we have also varieties of tablets but we can't produce all the types of tablets The production procedures are a bit different from the ones we have in the infusions division 
\par <$B> <#/><-/>mhm
\par <$A> <#/>We also have different sections It depends on the type of products I mean the type of tablets they\rquote 
re producing They have uh the weighing section mixing drying section They have the compression section and they also have their packing section These are the different sections in the tabletting 
division and uh usually uh the production procedures <-_differs><+_differ> <-_from><+_with> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\v\fs24\lang2057  the type of tablets they\rquote re producing In the infusions division it\rquote 
s different because we always use the same procedures but uh in the tablet division some
times they have to mix the powder with water then they have to dry the powder in the ovens Then there is another <./>pros process where we call granulating They have to granulate this powder to make it then into small granules and uh this granules after b
eing dried they\rquote re then compressed into tablets and uh which are later packed into tins or into plastic bottles so at least we have uh a very big difference in the processes of production in these two divisions 
\par <$B> <#/>Oh I see and you uh pointed out earlier on that uh the government or for that matter the nation is the sole customer of your products Can you explain how 
\par <$A> <#/><-/>mhm We usually after producing our products we sell them to the central medical stores These are then concerned with the dis
tribution of these products into government hospitals into development dispensaries in Dar e Salaam and also up-country but uh sometimes we do uh sell our products let\rquote 
s say directly to Muhimbili Medical Centre when there is a need of doing so maybe they're in an emergency out of some products which they find that they can't until they\rquote 
re being sent to the central medical stores so they can buy from us directly but usually we don\rquote t sell them to private customers 
\par <$B> <#/>I see I was about to ask you as to how you monitor the uh suitability of your products uh after they\rquote re out of your company\rquote s premises 
\par <$A> <#/><-/>mhm Well in case of problems let\rquote s say maybe because of packaging problems especially with our bags we find that most of the bags <./>w uh maybe they uh <./>theyb <./>theyb they are being uh well what can I say they\rquote 
re not <-_>they\rquote re not<-/> reaching the customers maybe in good condition Some of them may be broken down }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\v\fs24\lang2057  because of their packaging or maybe their boxes and all that so w
e sometimes get complaints from the customers or sometimes we visiting them and find how our products are being stored because sometimes even the storage conditions they affect the suitability of our products 
\par <$B> <#/>uh How should they be stored 
\par <$A> <#/>uh Most of these products especially the tablets they have to be stored in dry cool conditions so you find that most of the storage places in the dispensaries they don\rquote t <-_they don\rquote t<-/> have proper <./>sp places of storing }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\v\fs24\lang2057  these products You find that it's <-/>it\rquote s too hot and uh sometimes you find that when the containers are opened they\rquote re not closed so they\rquote 
re introducing some moisture and uh this is then a good media for the bacterial growth so you find after some time these products are being contaminated by bacterial growth so we <./>hav the so there is this minor problem of storage 
\par <$B> <#/>Yeah given that uh the products are stored under safe conditions how are they guaranteed to last without losing their suitability 
\par <$A> <#/>}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\v\fs24\lang2057  Well in most cases we don\rquote t produce to satisfy the national demand so you find that as long as <./>the <./>mo <./>the I mean the quantity we are producing it won\rquote t last time }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>idiom}{\v\fs24\lang2057  before it uh it is all consumed but uh well we can make some tests If we're told the product hasn\rquote 
t been used for some time maybe three years or so we have some tests to make sure that this product still maintains the same uh content and other qualifications 
\par <$B> <#/>And <name/> somebody who is just listening to us would 
also wonder as to which uh particular diseases uh you <-/>you take into consideration during the preparation I mean the production stages of your injectables and tablets What are they What particular diseases are they going to tackle You mean all diseases
 found uh in the tropics
\par <$A> <#/>uh No not really Well there are varieties of uh medicines but we are <./>n <-_>we are<-/> unable to produce all of them so we only produce the essential drugs which we are capable of producing them }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{
\v\fs24\lang2057 
 For instance uh when we prepare these uh infusions these are very commonly needed for the replacement of the fluid in the body which has been lost maybe from circulation as a result of shock severe burns vomiting diarrhoea haemorrhage and other diseases 
which are which may cause the loss of uh fluid from <./>c circulation and on the other hand in the case of tablets we also can\rquote t produce all the tablets but we\rquote 
re only producing those which are commonly treating uh the most most of the diseases in our count
ry For instance we prepare anti-malarias We have uh analgesics which are pain killers for instance for example Aspirin or Panadol We have these uh antibiotics such as Tetracycline We have other types of uh tablets such as the vitamins vitamin C ferrosulph
ate which is used in the manufacture of blood and other vitamins such as vitamin B1 vitamin K These are all used they\rquote re commonly used in our country 
\par <$B> <#/>Yeah you also said that you\rquote re not yet uh }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_able>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  to satisfy the national demand what do think should be done in order that the demand is satisfied
\par <$A> <#/>}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\v\fs24\lang2057  I can\rquote t say for the time being because it depends uh well let\rquote s say if we can increase the number of uh pharmaceutical industries or let\rquote 
s say if we can improve the existing pharmace
utical industries in terms of machineries in terms of uh availability of uh raw materials and also sometimes uh the personnel if <./>w also they <./>m may who may be interested in working in pharmaceutical industries I think after some time we may be able
 to meet the country demands of pharmaceuticals }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$B> <#/>uh maybe there is something special uh which you <./>hab you have in stock for the future progress of your division that is the infusions division within the <name/> Pharmaceutical Industries 
\par <$A> <#/>Yes uh we have planned we had planned earlier to improve uh the division in terms of quality and quantity and by the aid of the DANIDA we were able to I mean to expand our unit and uh we\rquote 
re hoping that trial production may start in April late April or early May because in the meantime the I mean the main builders' work is already completed and uh the installation of machines is in full swing so we\rquote 
re hoping that by end of April or early next uh month I mean early May we may start the trial production using more modern machines and uh I think we may be able to at least meet the country\rquote s demand because we\rquote 
re hoping to produce more of uh uh better quality also
\par <$B> <#/>Well we wish you all the best I think that will be also for the good of the na
tion as a whole I thank you very much I this programme of Face the Mike we had a very auspicious moment to have our guest speaker <name/> who is head of the infusions division within the <name/> Pharmaceuticals based in Dar es Salaam and thank you very mu

<I> <$B> <#/>For the past year we've uh been working on uh our normal programme which includes counselling giving free clinical advice and uh social rehabilitation to victims of domestic and sexual violence <#/>But we've also been conducting our outreach 
p
rogramme where we whereby we visit schools we visit uh community centres religious organisations and so on to discuss the whole question of violence and what it entails and how the society can come together to fight it <#/>We've also been conducting works
h
ops for police officers which is uh part of the <./>initia <./>ini of the initiative started by the former Minister for Home Affairs uh uh Honourable Mrema when he made a call to TAMWA to conduct police workshops for police officers on gender sensitisatio
n to <./>es especially to help victims of domestic and sexual violence <#/>We've also opened sixteen new centres in and around Dar es Salaam which are at the moment quasi autonomous but we're hoping that in the future they'll be fully autonomous
\par <$A> <#/>I'm interested to know more about uh the research that you conducted for the police force <#/>How did this come into uh inception
\par <$B> <#/>Uh uh on the eighth of March uh this year in nineteen ninety-four the Minister the former Minister for Home Affairs uh 
Honourable Mrema visited the crisis centre as uh part of uh as part of the festival to mark the International Women's Day <#/>And when he visited the centre he made a donation of one million shillings and made a call to the centre in TAMWA to conduct work
s
hops <-/>workshops for police officers in Dar es Salaam as part of a gender sensitisation initiative so that police officers become sensitised on the issues of violence and uh against women and children and how they can help women and children when such i
n
cidents occur <#/>Therefore we <-/>we conducted a series of ten workshops whereby thirty police officers from eleven centres police uh stations in uh Dar es Salaam that included men and women and uh the workshops uh included uh subjects like counselling p
a
ra-legal skills uh gender sensitisation the whole issue of human rights and so on <#/>And at the end of uh three months we presented them with certificates and we are glad to say that we have kept in close contact with police officers because we feel that
 uh the centre uh the crisis centre that it has a very important role to play in society and so do police officers we believe that we have to work very closely together in order to eradicate violence against women and children
\par <$A> <#/>And how do you feel the subjects or things were taken by the police force
\par <$B> <#/>Uh well the first of all the whole concept of gender sensitisation was a bit uh strange for them in the sense that they were not aware of certain concepts for example of concepts of equality bet
ween men and women when it came to the home <#/>They <-/>they it usually <-_happen><+_happens> in the offices where you can find a woman <./>office police officer who has a subordinate with a male but in the home they could not imagine that a man and a wo
m
an are equal and that a woman has <-/>has equal rights and also in terms of human rights for the woman and children <#/>Women and children have uh <-/>have the right to the whole notion of human rights <#/>So we introduced uh concepts of human rights to t
hem in part as part of this gender sensitisation initiative <#/>After that we <-/>we <-/>we went full-scale into subjects like para-legal skills and counselling management and so on Initially we started with the whole notion of human rights
\par <$A> <#/>Okay and I believe you also told me that you opened some branches of the crisis centre up you know in the suburbs of Dar es Salaam
\par <$B> <#/>Yes we did <#/>We opened sixteen new centres uh in uh <-/>in the three districts of Dar es Salaam <#/>But we also opened th
em we went beyond to Coast region <#/>We opened for example at <name/> at uh <-/>at uh <name/> at uh <name/> at <name/> and so on <#/>And we also trained counsellors from those centres <#/>We trained about twenty-five counsellors from those centres so uh 
on skills like counselling and para-legal so that they know how to <-_>they know how to<-/> operate the centres
\par <$A> <#/>How did you identify these areas
\par <$B> <#/>We approached them through the <name/> offices and we <-/>we <-/>we asked them to identify wom
en who have shown initiative in terms of campaigns and when we met with these leaders these women we talked with them we talked to them about the whole issue of violence and then some of them put uh came forward and came up with the idea that they would l
ike to have centres in their own areas <#/>And uh we decided that they needed training <#/>So we trained them for three months and then went to open the centres
\par <$A> <#/>Do you feel Leila after doing all this work the groups that you've trained so far really understand the whole concept of violence against women and gender sensitisation
\par <$B> <#/>Yes they do because you see it's part of the training <#/>During the workshops we conduct skits which are very short uh dramas based on real life experiences <#/>We 
<-/>we show skits of domestic violence <#/>We show skits of sexual violence whereby a woman is <-/>is put in a situation uh where she is put in a situation as a victim and what happens when she is a victim <#/>So when they watch the skits sometimes they d
o take part in the skits themselves uh they can internalise the whole concept and it becomes even more realistic to them
\par <$A> <#/>And uh what else did you do I mean for NGOs perhaps
\par <$B> <#/>We trained about uh six other NGOs from different parts of the cou
ntry from Mwanza from Mbeya Njombe from uh Tabora from uh Singida from Same on NGO management para-legal skills and counselling so that they can also open centres in their own areas
\par <$A> <#/>Was this a request by them
\par <$B> <#/>Yes it was a request by them because uh part of the initiative in the centre is to produce literature on uh our <-/>our work in the centre as well as on concepts of violence what the law says about violence which we call them }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  uh legal <-/>legal literacy <#/>They some of th
e groups got hold of the pamphlets and got hold of our address and they wrote to us and asked us if they could come and train with us <#/>In fact we trained about sixty people from the <./>dif from the other NGOs and we trained about thirty police officer
s
 and we trained about twenty-five people from the new <-/>new crisis centres the smaller ones <#/>So you find that we've been doing a lot of training this year which means to a large extent we've been sort of the centre has had a multiplying effect <#/>We
 have had new centres opening up and we hope that in the future many many more centres will be opened up throughout the country
\par <$A> <#/>People might argue that uh perhaps TAMWA is expanding too much because now you are training people as far as Mbeya also <#/>How do you make follow-up for instance
\par <$B> <#/>Well uh the groups in Mbeya are autonomous <#/>They have registered in their own <#/>They've their own constitutions <#/>They have their own uh uh framework of operations and so on <#/>But uh what we do i
s we give them skills that we learned the hard way <#/>See in TAMWA we didn't really have a blueprint with uh we had to learn by through <-/>through trial and error <#/>And uh what we learned through trial and error we put down in <-/>in the form of notes
 
form of workshops participatory workshops we call them <#/>So what we do is we share our experiences with others <#/>And they <-/>they <-/>they learn from us but they also go to adapt what they learned from us to their own according to their own environme
n
t and situation <#/>And you find that it has a multiplying effect what they learned from us they go to the villages and they teach people there and the people in the villages go and teach others <#/>So you find that we have this very huge network <#/>A lo
t
 of them are autonomous and independent but we have a network in the sense that we are all closely emotionally connected and they write to us and we write to them <#/>Some of them got promoted and they wrote to me and said that they've got promotion <#/>S
ome of them became friends some of them uh contribute to <name/> magazine <#/>Some of them help to distribute our booklets our pamphlets and so on <#/>So we have a very big network
\par <$A> <#/>What are some of the problems that you encountered in the course of training and conducting these workshops
\par <$B> <#/>Uh I think the problems mainly have been in terms of concepts <#/>A lot of the concepts for example a lot of the notes that we've got from secondary sources were written in English <#/>So we had to translat
e them into Swahili in order for the village person people from the rural areas to understand <#/>Some of the concepts are really aren't <./>trans uh you cannot translate them into Swahili that would be very apt <#/>So we had to <-/>to <-/>to do skits to 
e
xplain some of the concepts for to them to for them to understand <#/>We had to sort of mime and do plays and skits <#/>But uh eventually they did understand <#/>For example the whole issue of violence in terms of gender sensitisation how do you transmit 
t
hat into proper Swahili so that a person from the village would understand what gender sensitisation means <#/>And uh you can see uh things like that but uh later on we came up with our own jargon <#/>I think we ought to put it in the Swahili dictionary s
o that it can be accepted but people understood and uh a lot of the ideas came from the participants to the workshops
\par <$A> <#/>And I mean you had these uh resounding successes you know conducting workshops and also getting letters afterwards that people had
 been promoted and also those wanting to get in touch with TAMWA <#/>Now how do you <-_vision><+_envision/envisage> you know the coming year <#/>What are you going to do
\par <$B> <#/>Well uh we want to uh conduct the outreach programme nation-wide <#/>So far w
e've conducted the outreach programme in Dar es Salaam Coast region and uh Coast region Dar es Salaam in Morogoro Tabora Kilimanjaro and uh some parts of uh Tanga and Zanzibar <#/>But we want to conduct the <-/>the <-/>the outreach programme throughout th
e
 country <#/>What we want to do is we want to have an outreach team that would be based in Dar es Salaam that would train people from those areas to come <#/>Others the outreach team goes travels to that area and trains <./>tea local teams because they'll
 
be more adaptable they'll be more acceptable to their own people there they would know the area more train them on outreach techniques so that they can conduct the outreach programmes <#/>We also have plans to open hundreds of centres throughout the count
r
y but uh our constraints are funds and also in terms of linkages <#/>How do we link with these people because the people have to come forward to ask us to help them establish a centre <#/>We just can't go from Dar es Salaam and go to a strange area and sa
y we want to open a centre <#/>We wouldn't be accepted in that area <#/>The idea has to come from the people themselves
\par <$A> <#/>So far the crisis centre has used the approach of multi-disciplinary }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  <#/>How do you hope to involve maybe the youth 
so that they can also be part and parcel of this and grow up you know with the concept of you know self-advancement in terms of uh violence against women
\par <$B> <#/>We have a programme here which we're <./>go <-_>which we are<-/> going to start in January uh
 <#/>In fact the co-ordinator is not here <#/>It's <name/> <#/>She is co-ordinating a programme on the child labour <#/>It's called a programme on child labour <#/>And on this programme we're going to use the young people to talk to the young people <#/>W
h
at the what TAMWA will do is to provide training for the outreach team on outreach techniques pamphlet production and so on <#/>And then we're going to get the young people to go and talk to the young people about the rights of the child about uh human ri
ghts regarding the child about uh child labour about uh child uh abuse child defilement child sexuality about drug abuse and so on
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 <$A> <#/>And uh looking at it all what would you like to say Leila about the crisis centre
\par <$B> <#/>I'd just like to say thank
 you to all the counsellors in the centre because it is the result of team effort I mean I I'm being interviewed here but I <-/>I don't work alone in fact we are a team of about thirty people And all of us have contributed equally towards eradicating dome
stic and sexual violence in this country

<#/>Sadolin's Tanzania Limited is a paint
 making factory which is situated along Pugu Road not very far from the Tazara Mechanical Centre <#/>The firm which is privately owned has its headquarters in Copenhagen Denmark and receives the bulk of its technical aid from the Scandinavian countries <#
/
>Apart from manufacturing paints for various uses it also produces glue and other related products <#/>One aspect which attracted the producers of this programme when they visited the factory premises is the efforts being undertaken by the factory's manag
e
ment to resort to the use of local materials in the production process which amounts to sixty per cent <#/>This wisdom arises from the fact that the nation is currently plagued by lack of foreign exchange <ea/>Ndugu Adabo Moshi has served thirteen years w
ith the company and knows a lot about the company's operations <#/>How did the Sadolin's Tanzania Limited come into being <ea/>Ndugu Moshi 
\par <$C> <#/>Uh Sadolin's paints started in nineteen uh sixty-three near uh <O_>}{\b\v\fs24 three words}{\fs24 <O/> in the north and uh we <-
_shift><+_shifted> from uh from that place it was a go-down we <-_shift><+_shifted> from there in nineteen sixty-eight we <-_start><+_started> a new company Sadolin's 
\par <$B> <#/>How did it come up }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24  <#/>We are told that there are <-_>there are<-/> branches outside the country also <#/>Is there any connection between the those branches and this particular one 
\par <$C> <#/>Uh this company that is a branch from Nairobi it was in Nairobi and our <-/headquarter> it was }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  Denmark and there is a bra
nch in Kampala and a depot from Mwanza but they <-/>they just uh can't get Mwanza they're now Sadolin's 
\par <$B> <#/>What types of paints uh does your factory produce 
\par <$C> <#/>Uh we produce water paints oil paints automotives uh <O/> paints emulsion paints <#/>We use a local raw material now because of shortage of foreign kinds we don't have so we decided to find another way of <-/>of this 
\par <$B> <#/>What types of uh raw materials are used in the manufacture of paints 
\par <$C> <#/>We have uh different types <#/>Some of them we get them }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  from abroad and a few of them we get here in Tanzania as a local material
\par <$B> <#/>Which of those do you get from abroad and uh and which uh <-/>which are locally produced 
\par <$C> <#/>Really we there is oil paints <#/>Oil paints you don\rquote t have here and uh some of the powders we get them from abroad of which here we can get them but we have uh few of the powders we can get here }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
\par <$B> <#/>I'm told that uh you are also embarking on a programme of using raw materials because of the constraints of foreign exchange <#/>Uh could you tell us something on this programme
\par <$C> <#/>Uh really we'd send our <-/>our report getting the raw material quantity we need from the Bank of Tanzania but we didn't get }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  <#/>Then 
we are now using some other companies which uh they need paints they just bring us uh the quantity of paints they want <#/>Then we can we write down uh a list of raw material we need for making that <-_paints><+_paint> and then they just send a letter to 
the Bank of Tanzania that\rquote s just to cover foreign currency then they bring the materials then we make the paint for you 
\par <$B> <#/>Apart from the raw materials you get from abroad <ea/>Ndugu Moshi I'm particularly interested uh in knowing what types of local materials you use in the manufacture of paints 
\par <$C> <#/>Uh here we use some of them we have only powders and uh there is our glue which we are getting them }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  near and uh few of them but not as uh now we are using local material sixty per cent a
s the general manager told you 
\par <$B> <#/>What do you do say about the standards and quality of your paints you produce }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
\par <$C> <#/><ea/><O_>}{\b\v\fs24 several words}{\fs24 <O/> in uh we have uh these oil paints <#/>There are three types of paints we have and uh wate
r paints we have about uh four in number <#/>We have first quality second quality and third quality and fourth quality 
\par <$B> <#/>uh What would you say uh compared to international standards what is the standing of your paints you produce }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  here
\par <$C> <#/><O/> our stand of producing paints if we get uh raw material we can make uh good quality <#/>If we don\rquote 
t have uh raw material so we just produce less <#/>From more local material we get from here in Tanzania we get powders like kaolin which we get 
from <O/> mining and uh we have these pigments <#/>we get them from Mwanza and and there is other things like glue we get them from uh <-/>from <O/> Limited from Tanga uh and there are some <O/> for filling pens some of them we get from <name/> and some o
f them others we get from <name/>
\par <$B> <#/>uh Does the quality of the paints change whether you use local or materials imported from outside 
\par <$C> <#/>Yes there are some changes because uh you see we make a test first when we receive the local materia
ls here and then we compare with the imported raw materials <#/>Then we <-/>we can put some percentages of uh local material and the imported raw materials so you can <-_>you can<-/> see that we have uh we use a little raw material from abroad and use a l
ot local raw material yes
\par <$B> <#/>uh Would you briefly <ea/>Ndugu Moshi tell our listeners uh the production line this stage the first stage in the manufacture of paints 
\par <$C> <#/>uh The first <./>import the first stage of uh manufacturing paints first of 
all we <-/>we take uh small containers <#/>Small containers that is the big containers and the small containers <#/>We put them in a scale <#/>That's the first thing and then after that we take a formula of all raw materials which needed }{\b\v\fs24 
<&/>grammar}{\fs24  to make a paint and then we weigh it <-_in><+_on> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24 
a scale through their kilos written in the formula <#/>Then after that we send it to the mixer machine <#/>You stir it <#/>There is time of stirring them }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  and then putting step by step }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 <#/>Then you end up the paints 
\par <$B> <#/>How are your training programmes }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>idiom}{\fs24  as the uh training officer of Sadolin's uh factory 
\par <$C> <#/>Well you see there is those illiterate people they don't know how to to read and then but after training t
hem they know how to write and read and some of them uh they know how to talk English because some of our raw materials are written in English so they have to know how to read English and uh I've sent some of the people here too from abroad one of them bu
t he's not here <#/>He has already resigned and uh one from Nairobi and uh we are training others people from <O/> to go to some other places like <ea/><O_}{\b\fs24 >}{\b\v\fs24 several words}{\fs24 
<O/> for practice uh and there are others we send them from metal engineering from <name/> you know <name/> for training on maintenance on machines and uh I think it does
\par <$A> <#/>That was <ea/>Ndugu Moshi who apart from being the factory's supervisor is the training officer <#/>Juhata branch chairman and raw materials' controller <ea/>Ndugu 
Resa Ganji is the assistant production manager who is a chemical engineer by profession <#/>Although he has been with the company for a very short spell he was able to furnish us with the factory's details <#/>Here is <ea/>Ndugu Ganjii narrating the whole
 procedure of producing paints 
\par <$D> <#/>Well we have basically two kinds of paint here uh <#/>We make emulsion paint which is water-based and uh we make oil paint which is oil-based or alkyd resin-based <#/>I'll talk a little bit on the emulsion paint firs
t which is water-based <#/>Basically the water paint consists of uh the emulsion which is water and a glue and the pigments which give us the colour finally <#/>Uh first uh this process as such is a physical process <#/>We start by adding all the powders 
m
ostly the pigments and the extenders plus the glue in a <-_>in a<-/> vat which is a sort of a drum a pre-measured drum <#/>All these ingredients are weighed and then put inside the drum mixed with water <#/>That's basically our process <#/>The formulation
 
indicating the quantities of which ingredient is already tailor-made and uh it is conceived in Denmark Sadolin's uh headquarters there in the main lab <#/>So what we basically do we got to just take the formulation read the formula which is already made a
n
d do the mixing of the paint here <#/>The same thing applies uh with the <-/>the oil paint <#/>It's just that the ingredients are different <#/>There in the oil paint we don't use water we use mostly the the resins but the pigments are just the same <#/>A
fter the mixing of the paint the paint is subjected to some tests which are again prescribed by the Sadolin's headquarters in Denmark uh <#/>We carry <-_on><+_out> tests uh for such as viscosity tests uh density specific gravity drying time and opacity 

\par <$B> <#/>And how is the colour of the paints determined 
\par <$D> <#/>uh The colour of the paints <./>determine we have an equipment called a colour-meter which measures the colour of the paint <#/>The colour of the paint of course is imparted by pigments various pigments and uh mixing of various pigments as well 

\par <$B> <#/><ea/>Ndugu Resa Ganji as the assistant production manager of Sadolin's uh factory uh apart from the uh manufacture of paints what also does the factory engage in 
\par <$D> <#/>Well uh apart uh from manufacturing paints we manufacture spot putty <#/>I mean putties <#/>We manufacture varnishes as well and uh I think that's it now 
\par <$B> <#/>And <-_how><+_what> is the structure of the Sadolin's Tanzania Limited 
\par <$D> <#/>Well uh we have the managing dire
ctor followed by the general manager and the factory manager who's in charge of the factory area <#/>The factory manager of course is assisted by <-/>by me and uh a mechanical engineer who looks after the machines you know
\par <$B> <#/>Uh what is the factory's production capacity 
\par <$D> <#/>The factory's uh capacity is about uh twenty thousand litres per annum <#/>That\rquote s combined output including oil and emulsion paint <#/>But at the moment because of the constraints in foreign exchange which have resulted in uh
 lack of raw material we are doing about uh <-_eighty><+_eighteen> thousand litres 
\par <$B> <#/>uh In fact <ea/>Ndugu Moshi just mentioned the constraint of foreign exchange <#/>In fact I wanted to know <-_at><+_to> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24 what extent would you say uh lack 
of foreign exchanges affected your operations and what are you doing about that 
\par <$D> <#/>Well uh the lack of foreign exchange has affected our operation as it has in <-/>in many industries <#/>Our <-/>our capacity now is almost sixty per cent but uh we ar
e trying to uh make efforts to find a local substitute of raw material which will fit into our formulations and in this field I <-/>I can say that we have made some progress <#/>We have uh for instance in our emulsion paint the pigments consumed <-_is><+_
are> for about sixty per cent locally available uh and right now we are experimenting on some other pigments which are also locally available 
\par <$B> <#/>uh Does the fact that you are now getting uh in local raw materials uh does it change the quality of your paints in any way
\par <$D> <#/>uh No so far our quality has remained consistent despite the fact that we are substituting local raw material <#/>Of course uh when we are substituting we are going very cautiously and uh making a lot of research }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24 
 before we conclude any product but so far we have had no problems with our product 
\par <$A> <#/><ea/>Ndugu Resa Ganji despite the elaborate plans of the company's training programme some workers are yet to learn to speak English the so-called language of civilisa
tion <#/>But that is not a handicap because they know their work <#/>Here is one of them <ea/>Ndugu <name/> who mixes the raw materials for paints production in its early stages <#/>What does he do

 <-_professionally><+_professional> number <#/>I measure the requirements and work on them <#/>After that the experts come to assist and to check my work <#/>When I'm through I send it to my next colleague who passes it to the mixing machine

\par }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>noises}{\v\fs24  
\par }{\fs24 <$A> <#/>From there the next stage in the production line is the tinting section where the colour of the paints is determined <X_>}{\v\fs24 Basing on specification <ea/>Ndugu Mohammed Omari is well conversant with what takes place in this stage

\par <$A> <#/>Apolinari James of the finishing department}{\fs24  }{\v\fs24 <#/>The last point is the stores where the paints are stored when they are ready for sale <ea/>Ndugu <name/> has the story 
\par <$H> <#/>}{\b\v\fs24 <&/>Kiswahili}{\v\fs24  }{\b\v\fs24 and}{\v\fs24  }{\b\v\fs24 translation from Kiswahili> }{\v\fs24 
This is the stores department where paints are stored ready for sale <#/>There is a certain pattern of storage <#/>The emulsion and the oil types are stored in tins and plastic containers following specific orders from customers <#/>We used to have retail
 customers but now the Minister of Industries has banned retail sales because of the shortage of paints 
\par <$A> <#/>That was in a nutshell paints production <#/>Another important link in the overall chain is the sales department <#/>When our producers entered this office they encountered <ea/>Ndugu <name/> who was supposed to educate the masses }{\b\v\fs24 
<+_about>}{\v\fs24  how his department operates but to our amazement he became dumb and protested that he was in no position to explain his duties <#/>Nevertheless after his unca
lled-for behaviour we approached the general manager who was more than eager to furnish us with the details of the said sale department <#/><ea/>Ndugu Rajani who combined with other responsibilities that fall under him 
\par <$I> <#/>We have two people working 
at the moment in the sales department uh One is especially uh appointed to look after the the sales to the parastatals the government and all the <-/>the project people whereas we have the other salesperson looking after the sales to the uh construction p
e
ople projects and dealers to ensure that all our goods are very well distributed all over Tanzania that is all parts of <-_the> Tanzania and wherever possible uh equal distribution uh The function mainly of the sales department is to <-/>to look into the 
availability of the stock and to actually distribute it to <-/>to various projects parastatals and important uh developing institutions to ensure that uh all the important places are distributed with the paint which is very little available }{\b\v\fs24 
<&/>idiom}{\v\fs24  due to the poor economic condition of this country 
\par <$B> <#/>Uh <ea/>Ndugu Rajani uh what do you have in the company in the line of uh welfare for <-/>for the workers of the company 
\par <$I> <#/>We have we sort of give allowances in respect of the transport lunch a
nd yah milk and uh uh we also give things like gifts uh during the uh annual Christmas During the Easter holidays we give some sort of bonus uh we also uh uh <-/>we <-/>we also have a non-contributory uh endowing scheme whereby workers are not contributin
g from their side On their behalf the company is contributing uh }{\b\v\fs24 <+_to>}{\v\fs24  the endowing scheme uh We have uh }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\v\fs24 
 ten <-_yearly><+_year> bonus for a worker who completes ten years We also have a twenty <-_yearly><+_year> bonus We have a twenty-five year
 bonus system whereby a worker is encouraged to continue and work harder We have also now looked into the possibility of giving some sort of incentive in terms of uh achieving the target of the company in terms of volume and the quantity of the manufactur
ed goods
\par <$B> <#/>Do you face any uh challenges in the paints industry given the fact that there are other paints factories in Dar es Salaam 
\par <$I> <#/>Quite frankly uh we are not facing any such challenges to start with because our product is superior and p
eople like our product uh Number two there could be a very good reason for not having a challenge because of lack of raw materials You know almost of the most of the paint companies are working almost at ten to fifteen per cent capacity In other words the
 demand is more where the availability is very little indeed As such obviously I'm not in a position to really say whether you know uh the reason is uh uh a competition or really the demand
\par <$A> <#/>After the general manager's reflections we approached the accounts department where the chief accountant <ea/>Ndugu Nathan narrated the tasks undertaken by his department 
\par <$J> <#/>It is the function of the accounts department it\rquote s to control all the finance of the company and look after the company's uh welfare and the finance You know the chief of the accounts department is mainly concerned with}{\b\v\fs24 
 <+_article>}{\v\fs24  checking of all the delivery of orders all the cash sales daily to see that the correct prices have been charged to the customers and later on the cheque is being filled }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24 
 and later banked and banked And this is recorded in the receipt cashbook And there is also a payment cashbook in which all payments which is }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24  all the cheques and payments are made are recorded in that <-_books><+_book> a
nd these are later posted in the main ledger and a trial balance is later extracted at the end of each month 
\par <$B> <#/>Uh <ea/>Ndugu Nathan how does this department differ from the sales section 
\par <$J> <#/>The sales department is mainly concerned <-_of><+_with> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  }{\v\fs24 
the sales of the items When a customer comes for any request of the paint he has to attend the <./>cust <-/>the <-/>the sales department first to give him his request If the goods are available then he\rquote ll write him a delivery order or uh cash
 sale uh provided he has brought uh sufficient funds to meet his demand because all our cash our sales are on cash basis mostly on cash basis except for the government and the parastatals and the ministries We give them a proforma invoice and the cheque i
s followed later on Now the sales department is looking  }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24 
 after the stock of all the finished goods and they have maintained a ledger of each <-_items><+_item> to see that whatever stocks in goes in the fresh goods <-_is><+_are> recorded in the s

you an interview with Professor Anna <?/>Tbeijuka about the National Women Council BAWATA <#/>Stay tuned }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/> music}{\b\fs24\lang2057 
\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <$A> <#/>The National Women Council BAWATA which was registered recently was established in July nineteen ninety-four but it is a known fact that }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 
majority of women in this country still do not know the aims and objectives of the council <#/>Professor Anna <?/>Tbeijuka interim chairperson of the council elaborates
\par <$B> <#/>Well the objectives of the uh National Women's Council or BA
WATA is to unite all women you know in their struggle for equality <#/>The idea here there are many women groups there are many women individuals who are concerned you know <-_by><+_about> the unequal position of women in society <#/>So the council is her
e to act as an umbrella organisation and provide a united forum where women can meet and discuss their position and lay out strategies on how to proceed 
\par <$A> <#/>The council is still new to most of us <#/>Now can you please tell us the organisation's structure and the membership procedures 
\par <$B> <#/>Well uh BAWATA was formed actually in July last year by }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057 
 National Women's Conference which was held at the University of Dar es Salaam where about four hundred women met Every region was presented by 
about seven representatives <#/>The idea was to capture a broad spectrum of women interest groups uh you know there were for example women from the ruling party women from the opposition women from uh the Islamic community women from the Christian communi
t
y women from economic NGOs <#/>They all assembled in <?/>Kuruma last year at the <?/>Kuruma Hall University of Dar es Salaam and unanimously decided to form this umbrella organisation which is called BAWATA you know <#/>So it is a new it is newly register
e
d but it has been operative now for the last nine months <#/>Uh it is true that it is a as a new organisation many people have not heard about it but actually its origin is that it has <./>membersh members founder members are found all over Tanzania <#/>I
n all regions of Tanzania BAWATA has founder members <#/>So it is an idea which will spread very very quickly throughout the <-_countryside><+_country> 
\par <$A> <#/>Now can you tell us the membership procedures in case one wants to join <-_with> the council 
\par <
$B> <#/>Yes the organisational structure of BAWATA actually starts from the grassroots <#/>It's a grassroots organisation <#/>It has a structure which we can call which is vertical in the sense that you have village to the district to the region and then 
to the national level but then it is also horizontal <#/>It is horizontal structure }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 in the sense that women can join as individuals or they can join as groups so for example if you have a group of women who are interested in raising chicken in a
 village and others who are maybe sewing who are sewing who are doing handicraft they can also their groups can also join BAWATA <#/>So you have what you call a horizontal co-ordination of women activities at village level or at district level at national
 
level and then you have a vertical structure so that you have a democratic representation <#/>So it is a democratic institution in the sense that you reach the grassroots so that the national leaders have contact with the grassroots <#/>Horizontal that wo
m
en can talk with each other even if they have different interests <#/>It is a non-partisan women's organisation in the sense that it does not <-_>it does not<-/> discriminate anybody <#/>Women from different political parties can join <#/>In fact the wome
n
's sections in political parties can join UWT for example can join BAWATA if they like <#/>The women members in CHADEMA can join BAWATA if they like Their section can join BAWATA so it does not discriminate <#/>Women lawyers can join <#/>Professional wome
n
 groups can join BAWATA <#/>So the <-/>the procedures then for joining will be that when the branches are <-/>are established in uh <-/>in districts and in regions and then finally in the villages uh women will just apply for membership <#/>The membership
 
fee is only two hundred fifty shillings <#/>It is the <./>low that is a minimum and the idea is to make it to keep the fee accessible to most of the women so the fee that it must be something that the majority of women can afford <#/>So you apply for memb
e
rship and if twenty-five people in a <-_>in a<-/> <-_>in a<-/> village are necessary and fifteen people at a place of work like Radio Tanzania <#/>You need fifteen women to open your branch but if you are not <-_>you are<-/> <-_>you are not<-/> enough you
 can invite your neighbours you know surrounding offices can also join your group and you can open your branch <#/>So the procedure for membership is very simple <#/>Registration forms will be spread }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057 
 and women can just you know twenty-five or fifteen women gather up }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057  and form a branch <#/>It is as simple as that 
\par <$A> <#/>But uh from my experience sometimes it is really impossible to change somebody to something which she has used to do }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  <#/>Now what methods are you going to u
se to convince these women to join with the council
\par <$B> <#/>Yes well I should explain very clearly here that uh actually BAWATA is an umbrella organisation so women don't have to give up anything to join BAWATA <#/>They just add BAWATA onto the list of ac
tivities they are doing <#/>So as an umbrella organisation you <-/>you can still keep your <-/>your membership in TAMWA for example in your case <#/>You <-/>you <-/>you would still <./>rem remain a member of TAMWA <#/>In fact that is <-_>that is<-/> the T
a
nzania Media Women's Association for example <#/>I am assuming that you are a member of that association <#/>So that you don't have to give up that association to become a member of BAWATA <#/>You just join BAWATA and uh in fact even that association can 
j
oin BAWATA because if that association for example wants to send a representative to the National Congress then they have to join BAWATA and I <-/>I would like to believe that the women's association a professional women's association like TAMWA would lik
e
 to be in the national congress then they would join BAWATA <#/>So you don't this is something that you just become richer you add something onto yourself <#/>You <-/>you don't lose anything else <#/>I think it is really selling itself but all the same we
 are going to spend a lot of time on education you know informing the people what this organisation is all about making clarifications <#/>We have to clarify things which I was saying it's a new thing so you have to clarify 
\par <$A> <#/>So if the UWT member ca
n join BAWATA the <?/>Chedema woman can join BAWATA the <name/> girls can join BAWATA <#/>Now are you not afraid that the CCM woman can bring CCM ideas or the <?/>Chedema woman can bring the <?/>Chedema ideas <#/>Are you not afraid that uh chaos might hap
pen or might erupt on the way 
\par <$B> <#/>Actually uh the idea of a non-partisan wom
en's organisation of course people will still remain with their ideas but you see people join BAWATA well because of the importance of meeting as women to discuss our problems the <-/>the common line the <-/commonalty> that as women we are discriminated <
#/>So for example women from different political parties will join BAWATA because they would like to have a forum where they can breathe in space leave back }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057 
 party positions ideology and things like that and just talk as women you know <#/>So defi
nitely those who are not yet enlightened will be enlightened that this is a forum which is non-partisan where everybody is equal and where everybody is valued <#/>And women are not a homogeneous group <#/>For sure they have different views <#/>They see th
i
ngs differently but we are united in the <./>dec to fight the discrimination against us <#/>That is the whole point so that we do not really foresee with the proper education we <./>shoul we'll not foresee any problems because our members will be enlighte
n
ed that we are meeting here that the whole purpose of joining BAWATA you know is to leave behind you know party positions and party heckling and you know fan being a fan you know being excessive <#/>You <-/>you are coming in a forum where you can keep coo
l and discuss the problems of women and the strategies to solve such problems 
\par <$A> <#/>Professor <?/>Tbeijuka you can talk at length about the <-/>the council but uh so long as they are not going to benefit anything }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  from the council they won't 
be able to join with uh BAWATA <#/>Now can you tell us what is the difference between the council and the other women organisations such as UWT 
\par <$B> <#/>Well you see the UWT is a women <-_>a women<-/> section in a political party and I think the <-/>the <
-/>the <-/>the <-/>the political parties are also establishing you know their women wings <#/>So I think CHADEMA is also trying to establish its own and <name/> is trying to establish its own etcetera etcetera etcetera and the UWT of course is a <-_>is a<
-
/> <-_>is a<-/> quite a big organisation <#/>It has been here for quite some time and uh during in the old system they were you know they were a machinery you know for a voice for all the women <#/>Now they're a voice for all CCM women <#/>BAWATA is bring
i
ng all those voices under one house under one umbrella as I say hence the name of an umbrella organisation <#/>The difference uh between the <#/>First of all I should clarify that there is no competition between BAWATA and UWT <#/>It is honorary collabora
t
ion uh UWT and many other similarly placed women sections in political parties these are women who are aspiring for political leadership <#/>They are a member of a political party <#/>It's because a political party by definition is a group of people who w
a
nt to get the powers of the state to govern <#/>BAWATA is a civic organisation <#/>It is not seeking governance per se but it is seeking good governance <#/>So BAWATA is an <./>organis is a civic society what we call civic society uh <#/>BAWATA is not uh 
i
s promoting women but this under our constitution now this can only be done within political parties so for example BAWATA we are encouraging women to come up and <-/>and <-/>and <-/>and <-/>and contest the next election <#/>They cannot do it under BAWATA
 
for the constitution that we have <#/>This they have to do within political parties so BAWATA is very easy busy trying to encourage women in CCM in CHADEMA in UTP <name/> etcetera etcetera please go forward make sure that your parties propose you for a ca
n
didate you see <#/>So BAWATA is a civic society organisation <#/>It is not seeking to get state power but UWT is a group of women leaders women who are aspiring for political leadership while the BAWATA women want good governance <#/>I think you can see t
he difference there

Yes BAWATA was established only last year but I'm sure you have been doing something to promote women's development <#/>What are the current activities of the council 
\par }\pard \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright {\fs24\lang2057 <$B> <#/>Yes uh since we started uh the women who founded B
AWATA this was at the <?/>Kuruma Hall University of Dar es Salaam they decided that four issues were very important <#/>The first issue was a question of land rights for women land rights for women and BAWATA has followed up this issue very closely uh <#/
>
We asked uh some uh experts at the University of Dar es Salaam and I was myself able to participate in that capacity as a professional woman <#/>We were able for example to present a paper at the National Land Conference which was held in Arusha and Minis
t
er <?/>Luasa was kind enough to <-/>to you know give us an audience in that <-_>in that<-/> conference and our argument was that women should get full land rights that time has come for women to get full land rights <#/>Another issue emphasised by the fou
n
der members and I think by many many women in Tanzania was the question of inheritance rights <#/>As you know many women many widows are really being you know being dispossessed by the relatives of <-/>of <-/>of <-/>of their diseased husbands <#/>This sit
uation now is increasing }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057  as the traditional uh uh kinship networks traditional customs break down <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
You know these are breaking down under the pressure of modernisation so that you find that uh people who were supposed to protect the widows are now the ones who are very busy grabbing away }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 the property and taking it away so that the customary traditional traditions which used to protect widows have <./erod> have been eroded Most of them have collapsed Society has changed So that we think t
hat it is now high time that the government came in to reform the law of inheritance We have been following up this issue very closely with the law reform commission you know chaired by Judge <?/>Maikasu we have been following it up very closely and they 
h
ave <-_>they have<-/> now just uh completed their <-/>their recommendations We have we are studying that those recommendations very carefully We have our own team of experts both men and women who are following up issues on our behalf So we are following 
u
p that <-/>that issue Unfortunately the idea was that they should reform these laws before the elections but I think that they were lagging behind in paperwork you know so I don't think now we are going to be able to realise this but then that makes it an
 election agenda so our women will be asking the contestants what is their position on women land rights what is their position on inheritance }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 We are also following up the issue of course of uh sexual violence against I mean violence and sexual 
harassment <-_for><+_of> women This is a very serious problem which is again increasing because of the modernisation You know urbanisation is going very fast Poverty is <-/>is spreading you know the society is sometimes the society is living under great s
t
ress so as a result you find that violence is increasing and violence against women particularly you know young girls and sometimes even boys below fifteen years is now a very serious problem So we are you know <-_>we are>-/> following up that issue with 
t
he government the relevant authorities to see that certain measures should be taken against the you know <-/>the <-/>the perpetrators and uh we are of course uh following up very closely with the relevant in-sector ministries the question for example of u
h
 proper budgeting you know for social <-/>social sectors the social services are very are closely watched by BAWATA What happens to health spending What happens to education for girls in these days of cost-sharing We are watching with concern the poor per
f
ormance of girls in <-/>in <-/>in <-/>in education This is not because girls are not intelligent but because girls you know are exposed to a lot of housework You know that girls for example have to help their overworked mothers and uh if you go around and
 look at some of the conditions in <-/>in girls' secondary schools for example they leave much to be desired you know So <-/>so we are following up these issues and we have been following up these issues and we shall continue 
\par <$A> <#/>Apart from the two problems that is land rights for women and inheritance for inheritance rights for women what are the major issues are you }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 concentrating <-_with><+_on> to promote the advancement of women especially on the economic side 
\par <$B> <#/>Yes as I said actually land rights for women is for us a tool of economic empowerment You see you cannot liberate a woman when she has no land That is the means of production 
\par <$A> <#/>You're correct 
\par <$B> <#/>Yes
\par <$A> <#/>Okay now what are you doing
\par <$B> <#/>Yes What we a
re doing is we are fighting for the reform of the laws which inhibit the women from getting access to land you know the ownership of land You know I know many cases where a woman for example goes to the bank and gets credit and starts a <-/>a small projec
t
 but in the evening they have a very big fight maybe you know a family disagreement and then you know maybe her spouse can't take it that I don't want to see your little hut here on <-/>on my premises That is the end of an economic venture for a woman who
 has not own land }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057  So because as I said BAWATA is itself an umbrella organisation women we are going <-_>we are going<-/> to encourage that women should form }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{
\v\fs24\lang2057  economic groups BAWATA itself is not meant to run these small projects like 
raising poultry or economic ventures BAWATA itself will not take up economic ventures by itself but we encourage members to organise themselves into <-_economical><+_economic> groups so that's the way of economic empowerment I mean this is a huge uh organ
i
sation with a structure from all villages so you can see here that you'd <-/>you'd run into a very big bureaucracy if you tried you know to organise your own economic ventures but you want to encourage your <-/>your members where they are you know to<-/>t
o start such ventures and support them For example you can support them with marketing with credit with professional advice with how to write projects write-ups and stuff like that 
\par <$A> <#/>We're still on the economic empowerment We know that most of the women in Tanzania are poor We can say that they are poor They have no capital to start uh small businesses Now do you have any plans to provide loans for these women
\par <$B> <#/>BAWATA itself I mean as I said this <-/>this <-/>this is the <-_>this is<-/> a civ
ic organisation you know fighting for rights uh It would not be correct to say that we are going to start distributing credit programmes but I understand I think the Ministry of Women Affairs has a credit fund for example but BAWATA would encourage women 
f
or example to organise themselves and establish a credit fund and BAWATA would solicit that the government for example replenishes the funds if they get exhausted So you can see it is a policy uh institution policy instrument It is not actually itself goi
ng around now to distribute credits to women but seeing that institutions exist to provide that service to women 
\par <$A> <#/>Now on the political side you know that we have the general election in October what are you planning to do for women 
\par <$B> <#/>Yes fo
r October we have very big plans actually We have our big operation uh uh voter education project We have what we call a contestant in voter education project for BAWATA women and uh for women generally so that uh in the case of contestants women who want
 
to run for the elections in constituencies BAWATA is encouraging women to go to the constituencies We are aware that we have some reserved seats but we don't think that is That is supposed to be a temporary measure you know while we are because we are sti
l
l very weak but we are more interested you know in the women who are really going to the constituencies to grab those seats and we are encouraging women from all political parties to come forward and we are very happy to say that many women are coming for
w
ard from CCM from CHADEMA from <name/> We are getting letters from the countryside We received a letter from Mwanza from a woman who said I want a campaign manager for example I'm running for this constituency and I need help There was a woman who was run
n
ing somewhere in Morogoro she was just saying that she wants to run that she wants assistance you know so we are <-_>we are<-/> helping women who are contesting the election They should you know campaign management for example how do you manage a campaign
 
How do you behave in public How do you handle sexual harassment heckling You <-/>you shouldn't you know so that women won't easily feel intimidated you know and forget what they are supposed to say You know we are trying to <-/>to <-/>to <-/>to empower th
e
 contestants but then we have voter education women ourselves you know what whom should we vote for We have a <-/>a <-/>a very clear election agenda Our agenda is very known I've just narrated it land rights inheritance rights good quality education for g
i
rls and things like that But uh this agenda the women must understand this agenda You know I'm <-/>I'm talking now for example of the village women the women the housewives they should be able to understand this agenda and women we <-/>we should be able t
o
 ask the questions to all these people aspiring for political leadership that what is your agenda on the women what is your position on land rights you know what is your position on family values what's your position on customs traditions which discrimina
te women These are the kinds of questions that we would like women to ask so the idea is to galvanise the electorate the women electorate you know to be together as a block women as a block can get through the agenda 
\par <$A> <#/>I understand that uh BAWATA has done <&/>}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 lexeme}{\v\fs24\lang2057  a number of activities within this short period Now what achievements have you made so far 
\par <$B> <#/>Yes well I think our achievements first of all even the registration itself was an achievement because you see it is a process which has 
taken nine months but it was a process in which we have you know uh conducted seminars all over the country in every region It is a <./>pro uh period in which we went to Dakar for example as you know we were together in Dakar we were trying to do research
 
to collect information about other women machineries in other parts of Africa That was a mainly you know besides uh joining the Tanzanian delegation we were also you know on a research mission trying to see what was happening there and through this we hav
e
 now been able to finalise our constitution and we have registered our association so that was quite uh you know some <-/>some <-/>some work to be done because we wanted BAWATA to be founded on a very firm foundation a solid foundation An umbrella organis
a
tion cannot function if it doesn't have a solid foundation You know you must have rules You must have a very clear constitution You must know the procedures You cannot allow you know this improvising here and there otherwise the thing will <-/>will collap
s
e You'll have to be very firm and very clear on what you are doing That is our one of our <-_achievement><+_achievements> for these nine months and then as I said that in the case for example the question of land at least we <-/>we were able to participat
e
 in the National Land Conference where the policy was uh <./>sug was recommended to the government I have seen the draft which was issued by the Ministry for Lands by and uh <-/>and uh this stated very clear the government position now is that women shoul
d
 get full land rights and this was of course we were building upon the work by Professor <name/> with the land commission but the government before had not you know taken a stand on that issue so BAWATA together with the UWT and other women who were there
 were able to push through such an agenda and I think we so those are the main achievements and I consider them some fundamental achievements 
\par <$A> <#/>Professor <?/>Tbeijuka we are all aware that uh BAWATA is still new to most of the women in this country and whenever you introduce a new thing there are problems here and there What are they 
\par <$B> <#/>Yes I can say that our challenge now I would call it a challenge rather than a problem I think our challenge now is to disseminate you know education so that w
omen can you know <-/>can see the reason why they should join BAWATA and as the branches are opened are <-/>are <-/>are opening up of course our structure is This is a huge organisation We have problems of finance We are trying to raise funds you know fro
m
 donors from the government who are assisting us So far we are getting quite a good response you know so we you know our <-/>our <-/>our challenge right now is making sure that this machinery reaches the women the target the beneficiaries whom we are tryi
ng to reach 
\par <$A> <#/>Finally what are your views }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\v\fs24\lang2057  to women as far as BAWATA is concerned 
\par <$B> <#/>Well my <-/>my appeal to women as far as BAWATA is concerned is that uh uh I hope they are hearing }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057  these voices I hope they are reading
 We shall really be on a you know a <./>mobil a mobilisation campaign that they will be open that those who have questions will come forward you know openly so that we can discuss We are operating on a principle of transparency and accountability that peo
p
le should come forward and give their views Those who have some grievances or some doubts can come forward because you see this machinery uh in the other countries where the women machineries work very well they operate on those principles you know transp
arency accountability and following the rules

\par }{\fs24 <I> <$A> <#/>Please welcome to another half-hour of the programme Be My Guest <#/>Our guest today is Professor Leonard Shayo from the University of Dar es Salaam <#/>Leonard Shayo is a mat
hematics professor and also a project leader of the International village of Science and Technology based in Arusha <#/>Professor Shayo is with us now here in the studio and he chats with my colleague <?/>Sekunje <?/>Kitoye 
\par <$C> <#/>Professor Shayo my first question is uh how did you bring yourself where you are
\par <$B> <#/>Thank you Mr <?/>Kitoye uh <#/>I only started my primary education in nineteen fifty-four at a grammar school known as <name/> <./>prim middle school <#/>No I started at a <-_>at a<-/> nat
ional <-/>national native authority primary school and then I joined the <name/> middle school in <./>nine middle school <-/>in nineteen sixty-two <#/>Let me say that the schools in those days the middle schools of those days were really like the secondar
y
 schools of today in the sense that uh the education was of a very high quality and really we had only one thing in mind just to pursue education with all our might <#/>So we managed to pass the class eight examination and then I went to <name/> Secondary
 School where I stayed until nineteen eighty-six nineteen sixty-six sorry <#/>And then I went to <name/> School where I started I studied pure maths applied maths and physics uh <#/>Those <O/> combinations were there }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammmar}{\v\fs24  }{
\fs24 #/>Today they are not there <#/>And let me again say that again we had only one thing in mind and that is just to pursue knowledge uh <#/>After that uh when I reached form six in nineteen uh uh in nineteen sixty-eight after filling }{\b\v\fs24 
<+_in>}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 the forms to choo
se our career I selected to become a mechanical engineer that is to go to Nairobi because I thought being an engineer is a good thing <#/>But uh maybe by that we were visited by a professor from the university of Dar es Salaam Professor <name/> <#/>He was
 
a professor of mathematics by then and he gave us a lecture in mathematics and I was very much impressed to see how elegant he was and how he made <-_>how he made<-/> his nice presentation <#/>So immediately I went to my headmaster and told him that I wou
l
d like to <-/>to join the university of Dar es Salaam and pursue education <#/>But I was made to go to my headmaster after asking that professor how can one become like you <#/>And he simply advised me that if you want to become like me uh select to go to
 
the University of Dar es Salaam and take mathematics and education that is enter into becoming a teacher and that's what I did <#/>And uh after doing my examinations then I joined the university of Dar in nineteen sixty-nine <#/>But because my aim was to 
b
ecome like this professor I had to study very hard when I was at the university because I knew that if I did not perform well then I would have been I would have gone to teach in the schools which I really <#/>My aim was to become like professor <name/> <
#
/>So that's uh why I studied very hard and after finishing my first degree I got my first class and immediately I was given a scholarship to go to Britain University of London <#/>Again I knew my ambition was to become like professor <name/> so I knew I m
ust get my PhD and after that I got my PhD nineteen seventy-seven at <name/> University and of course since then I've been working hard and there you have to work hard and publish to get promoted and so on
\par <$C> <#/>uh Exactly what do you do as a professor there at the University of Dar es Salaam
\par <$B> <#/>Of course there we uh the main responsibility there is to teach mathematics and also do research in mathematics <#/>But at present really and maybe since nineteen eighty eighty-seven I've been very busy in p
romoting this uh the International village for Science and Technology which I started then after spending my sabbatical leave at the International Centre for Theoretical Theses for two years <#/>That's nineteen eighty-five to eighty-seven <#/>And since ei
g
hty-seven then I've been very busy with this village <#/>So I must say that of course I do the teaching and also promoting this village whose objective is to bring about the scientific and technological revolution in Tanzania in particular and Africa in g
eneral.
\par <$C> <#/>You have been talking of the International Village for Science and Technology in Tanzania and uh my next question is about that uh which is uh the village is at Arusha <#/>What is this village all about
\par <$B> <#/>Well let me say that the con
cept of the village is at Arusha because really we have just started conceptualizing this village uh <#/>We have not really built the village as such <#/>The village is more now it's more in terms of projects and programmes <#/>We realize that it really t
a
kes a long time to build a whole village <#/>So we have started to run programmes <#/>After all <-_>after all<-/> really the village eventually has to be uh a set of programmes and projects because even if we build the buildings the buildings by themselve
s
 will not <-_construe><+_construct> the village <#/>So after we realised that it will take us a long time to get the land to build the village and the buildings to <-/>to I mean to be constructed <#/>So we have realised the village now in terms of just ru
n
ning the programmes which can be run without buildings <#/>At Arusha we have a small office which is the international conference centre which coordinates the programmes with the village <#/>Myself I'm at the University of Dar es Salaam <#/>I continue tea
c
hing at the university while at the same time <./>coor coordinating the activities of this village <#/>We hope that after we get the land which we are looking for which is about twenty-five square kilometres of land we shall forest this land and then mayb
e construct an international primary school for the talented kids and then we go on constructing other structures in <-/>in a priority basis
\par <$C> <#/>And about this Village of Science and Technology many people don't understand uh science and technology <#/>I mean these two words and what is the difference between uh these two words science and technology <#/>Can you elaborate on that 
\par <$B> <#/>Yah I think very briefly <-_>very briefly<-/> that science is the theory behind technology uh <#/>Technology has yo
u know is realized from implementing the theories of science <#/>For example uh a simple example is the theory behind the <-/>the water engine is <-/>is science but uh the realization of that theory into uh an engine which works is technology So technolog
y
 is the is what happens after you transform theories into <-/>into practical gadgets uh <#/>The theory for example the uh if you discuss for example a disease like malaria uh the <-/>the technology uh the <-/>the medicine that is made to cure malaria is w
hatever it is it's technology <#/>But the theory behind that medicine is science.
\par <$C> <#/>Uhu <#/>There is a question of food importation in our country and uh there are some problems in <./>import <-/>in importing these foods from outside the country whic
h some foods are <./>expired have <-/>have expired <#/>Now Professor Leonard Shayo why don't we use the technology and science because we have the experts to make our own food or can our own foods here in Tanzania 
\par <$B> <#/>Well let me say that that questi
on really it's <-/>it's complicated in the following sense that the technology of food production is when technology there is really very little to be discovered <#/>Of course our scientists are being sent here and there but if really the issue is just to
 
produce food well almost all the technology we need here is available <#/>It's available and what is maybe surprising is why don't we use this technology <#/>And in fact really one can discern some maybe bad motives in all this exercise <#/>Why should a c
o
untry like <#/>Why should our countries I mean African countries but <O/> in particular we have all the resources to produce all the food we need <#/>The rivers flow all the year taking water to the sea and if you go back in history you'll find that in al
m
ost all countries where there are rivers civilisation started in those rivers <#/>The people in Egypt for example depend on the River Nile to irrigate the agriculture so one question uh which really is not a question to be directed to a professor like mys
e
lf is a question that should be directed to the businessmen and the people's firms <#/>Why don't they use that the money they have to open big firms and produce the food in Tanzania rather than import the food from outside <#/>I mean that's a question tha
t
 can be asked to people with firms and those people who are <-_>who are<-/>importing food uh into the country in the name of business <#/>Why can't the same business people invest in the in producing food in Tanzania when we know we have plenty of land we
 
have so many rivers we could use to irrigate <-./>irrigat agriculture <#/>Why <-/>why are they not doing that <#/>So that's a question that maybe I would say maybe in terms of the radio why don't you call them here and ask them why are they preferring to 
i
mport food from outside rather than producing the food here in Tanzania or in Africa <#/>For one thing it is not profitable to produce food <#/>You know if you're investing in producing food you'll get more money than if you import the food and the proof 
i
s very simple <#/>Why are those farmers in America producing food and exporting to us <#/>It's because it's more profitable <#/>Otherwise they could have imported the food from us <#/>So they produce the food and sell to us because it's more profitable <#
/
>And with that argument why aren't our businessmen investing in food production and make more money if the aim is to make more money <#/>So personally if you ask me I'll say any <-/>any move to import food into the country is more directed to us by very b
a
d motive <#/>I'll <-/>I'll <-/>I'll maybe uh make one exception <#/>When there is a drought serious drought which you see then one can say let's import food from outside to save people from death but that's the only exception <#/>You see if you look at ma
n
y of our countries the trees are green the grass is green meaning it rained <#/>If <-/>if <-/>if for example you tell somebody there's drought in this country the answer is you don't know what a drought is and if you want to know what a drought is you sho
u
ld go to Israel go to the deserts of the Sahara then you'll know what a drought is <#/>So my <-/>my <-/>my<-/>my impression is that although we say there's a drought in this country what we should say is there's drought in parts of the country but not in 
t
he whole country <#/>You travel from here to Dodoma it's all green on both sides of the road and there's no food growing maybe grass and trees <#/>You travel from here to <-/>to Arusha it's almost all green <#/>The whole of the <name/> region is green and
 
yet there is no food and people are importing food <#/>So my challenge to you people on the radio call the businessmen ask them why do they import food into the country rather than investing in the rich land we have along the river valleys in this country
 and produce food for this country and make more money <#/>That question they should answer 
\par <$C> <#/>Professor Leonard Shayo maybe don't you think it's uh because of the policies of the government that it doesn't give room to these businessmen or men who want to invest in the country to <-/>to I mean to acquire big land so that they can farm.

\par <$B> <#/>I <-/>I <-/>I don't think I would say it is a policy of the government as such because I don't think there is anybody who has wanted land in this country to p
roduce food and he's been denied that <-/>that land <#/>Unless this person goes to land which is already occupied by some peasants <#/>Of course that's not acceptable because the very good land that can be producing without much energy can be left to the 
peasants <X_>}{\v\fs24 
The land which needs investment that is the land which is not suitable for peasant agriculture is the land which should be used by these businessmen And therefore what I'm saying is that I don't see there's a businessman who has gone to land which 
is really lying idle and there's a lot in this country and denied that land }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24 
 I don't think that is true but again let me say I am not in government but I believe it's not true and maybe to prove that I know we have some people from Iran who have
 being farming in this country We have the <-/> the people from I think it's Chinese who have assisted us to produce some food The Japanese help In <-/>in the lower <-/>lower Moshi area there's irrigation farming by the Japanese So what I'm saying is I do
n't think the businessmen of Tanzania actually made a serious initiative to produce food for this country And again I will repeat my challenge to your people Call them here and debate with them Let them say why they are not investing in agriculture
\par <$C> <#/>Well that's a good challenge
\par <$B> <#/>Well really I spend maybe almost all my spare time I don't know whether I have spare time because I find twenty-fours hours to be very little The responsibility of promoting this village of science and technology unde
r the conditions prevailing in this country are }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24 
 very very demanding so I find almost all my time is being spent to see how basically to do things in such a way as to realise this village in the shortest possible time So I don't have spare time 
If I have maybe I listen to music Maybe I sit down with my family and children but spare time is really hard to find In fact for that matter I will say there's no reason why anybody in this country should have spare time We are too poor to have spare time
 
The Japanese don't have spare time and the Americans <O/> Some time ago they <O/> spare time There's no reason actually why we should want spare time in a country which is so poor and for that matter I <-/>I really did not like it when I even heard that S
a
turday is not a working day We should have Sunday as a working day Even to say that people should work until three that is crazy fort a country like Tanzania I think we should work until maybe late night if at all we want to bring a revolution in this cou
ntry So I think if we are talking of Tanzania this question of spare time and leisure time should really come when we've worked so much and are too tired to work then you can have spare time 
\par <$C> <#/>Professor Leonard Shayo what is your view on the possibility of promoting science and technology through joint ventures here in Tanzania
\par <$B> <#/>Yah uh first of all let me uh say a few things about this business of joint venture Joint venture is uh is not a new phenomenon in <-/>in the world I mean it's someth
ing that's very bold uh is very <O/> but it really depends on how you take it Mind you joint venture is a business <-_>is a business<-/> and unless you are smart enough your counterpart in the <-_>in the>-/> <-_>in the>-/> venture may be too smart to <-/>
t
o really make sure that you don't uh get much out of uh that venture So I my first reaction is that there is a lot of benefit to promote uh science and technology in Tanzania through joint venture provided that we are prepared really prepared uh to make s
u
re that that we benefit out of that uh business But my problem I think my problem uh in the way we have uh approached the whole issue of joint venture in this country is that I think we really stand to lose because if really we want a joint venture in the
 
real sense we should have granted priority to the local people I could say for example when the Tanzania Breweries went into venture with the South Africans I don't believe at all that the for example the <?/>Sukomas in this country could not have given a
l
l the foreign money needed by the Breweries or even the <?/>Hayas or even the coffee brewers they could have completely given all this money because they earn a lot of money in terms of dollars I think So my question is why invite people to joint ventures
 
on the things which we already had built You don't invite uh somebody on a joint venture on a project which you already had The joint venture which I would have encouraged is a joint venture where somebody maybe two people a Tanzanian and uh maybe a Europ
e
an agree to <-/>to start a new industry There there is no problem But I'll say for those industries or those enterprises which we already had we should have <?/>given the joint venture We should have the idea was to make the government to remove the out o
f
 control so really the idea would have been to enable the local people to have to produce All that they need is to be able to do the amount of foreign money they need And even if you say you <-/>you are forcing them to a tender okay after getting the tend
e
r for example somebody from Germany says I'll give you four million dollars another one from Austria says ten million dollars the next step for us would be to ask the <?/>Sukumas or the <?/>Hayas do they have ten million dollars and if they help they get 
t
he <O/> So I <-/>I really don't agree at all just it's not something that we should do go into this joint venture <?/>branch It's very dangerous <-/>dangerous move uh That's really my reaction And I would say if I were to promote science and technology th
r
ough the joint venture I'd better get prepared get my scientists and my technologists who are really able to negotiate with the other side because those guys are really advanced and they can make you feel you are going to benefit and only find out a few y
ears later }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24 
 you'll have lost and they'll have bound you completely legally that you will have nowhere to go For one thing Maybe I will ask you a question really why did we fight for independence Before independence the British were in charge of t
his country We had no problems I mean we had a problem of <O/> but they were running all the industries and they would have built all industry for us So why did we ask for independence if we are told we are asking them to run our industries So my thing is
 
I think joint venture is good but between equal partners Equal partners in terms of intelligence and <O/> and perceive what is going to be the outcome of the venture Otherwise you go into joint venture like for example I go I am a professor of mathematics
 and I take a primary school <?/>team and I go into a joint venture with that <?/>team I can cheat that <?/>team and the <O/> thinks he's <O/> but he's not because I'm more <O/>
\par <$C> <#/>Professor Shayo you are reminding me about our state of economy in this country Our economy depends too much on aid from outside To what extent do you think aid is important in promoting science and technology
\par <$B> <#/>Well again I would say first status quo I would really want to hear as follows Does this country receive an
y aid to promote science and technology Maybe that's a question to be asked Do we receive aid in that direction And I think I would say if we do get aid to promote science and technology it's very minimal compared to the aid which comes in to promote othe
r
 things and I would dare say that a lot of money a lot of foreign money in our country is being <./>dir directed towards those areas which are of benefit to those people who need aid For example I'll <-/>I'll simply go to the area of information technolog
y
 uh You know information is power Once you have information about a group of people or of anything you can use that information to manipulate that group in the manner you want And really what is happening now is that there is a lot of uh <-_>a lot of<-/> 
u
h <-/>of aid or a lot of <./>mon foreign money coming into our country in various avenues to collect information and unfortunately this information is the type of information that is being used by the same people to oppress us later uh For example when uh
 <-/>when uh <-/>when we were told that we must go multi-party or when we are told that we must devalue our currency These <-/>These advices }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24 
 are coming because they've already studied all of us and unfortunately we are the ones who collected thi
s information for them who collected this information for them we bind it and they give a computer and laser <-_>a laser<_/> printer so that the information that you produce is very readable and nicely produced and we bind this information and give it to 
them They go and use this information and they come back to you and they tell you what you must do because they know every thing about you

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <I><$A> <#/>for those who are just listening this week facing the microphone is the chairperson of
 the Mathematical Association of Tanzania Dr <name/> Massanga <#/>Dr Massanga you have said that MAT or Mathematical Association of Tanzania is a non-governmental organisation NGO and such organisations they do have }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{
\fs24\lang2057  some relationship with other non-organisations outside the country so far <#/>Has MAT involved in any of the international organisations the non-governmental organisations this year <#/>What is the organisation
\par <$B> <#/>Uh <./>MA uh MAT <-_have><+_has> got uh correspondences with sim
ilar organisations in other countries <#/>We subscribe our bulletin to some similar organisations in Britain in uh USA and recently we are trying to have a link uh with some <./>organis uh mathematical association in Italy and uh there is some corresponde
nce with uh Namibia
\par <$A> <#/>And how does MAT meet its objectives
\par <$B> <#/>Uh for the first twenty-five years MAT has been striving to improve the average rating levels and standards of performance in the subject through various activities <#/>For instance 
uh in order to develop to share and to disseminate the original knowledge in the subject MAT publishes a bulletin <#/>The bulletin is called the Tanzanian Mathematical Bulletin and two uh issues come out annually <#/>This is for members <#/>Then there is 
a
 junior bulletin for students which is published uh once a year <#/>So far over forty-two volumes of the bulletin and over <./>for <-/>over ten issues of the junior bulletin have been published <#/>Next for improving the quality of existing teachers and k
e
eping them abreast of the subject matter and uh informing them of the latest development in the subject and in the maths education MAT conducts seminars and in-service training MAT has organised over twenty-four seminars at national level over fifteen sem
i
nars at grammar level and over seven in-service courses <#/>Thirdly in order to develop and stimulate interest of mathematics in students as well as to sharpen special ability and skills among gifted students in the subject MAT awards prizes to best-perfo
r
ming students in the National Examinations at Ordinary and A level <#/>It organises contests at national level and awards prizes <#/>It organises and sends students to international competitions <#/>MAT forms math clubs in schools and organises inter-scho
ol math fairs and exhibitions and uh also it organises research competitions
\par <$A> <#/>Dr <name/> Massanga you have also mentioned of the twenty-five years since the inception of the MAT or Mathematical Association of Tanzania <#/>And it is believed too that you are on your way that may be not very far that you will be celebrating 
the twenty-fifth anniversary. <#/>Could you just give us a hint as to what will be done during the celebrations
\par <$B> <#/>During the forthcoming celebrations uh we are going to hold uh exhibitions uh students' exhibitions on mathematical objects uh as well a
s games and puzzles <#/>We are going to the book display of mathematics books published by MAT and MAT institutions and others <#/>We are going to have a display of posters on the history of mathematics and the history of MAT <#/>Then we are going to have
 
our usual annual seminar <#/>In that seminar we are going to have uh lectures on different topics we are going to have a panel discussion on uh research uh mathematical research going on in the country <#/>We are going to have uh guest speakers who are go
i
ng to talk about the educational systems in other countries and current trends and we are going to have a lecture of the year which is usually a topic that has not very much to do with mathematics <#/>And uh we are going to hold our annual general meeting
 
in during which we are going to deliberate on problems facing the teaching and learning process in mathematics and uh we are going to come out with resolutions and recommendations which we usually send to policy makers policy implementors and uh the other
s who are concerned in the teaching process
\par <$A> <#/>Well before I take you to the problems or setbacks that are pressing the association Dr Massanga maybe I should ask you something on the celebrations <#/>I would like to know as to where and when are you going }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{
\fs24\lang2057  to have your celebrations and who will be the guest of honour
\par <$B> <#/>Our celebrations are going to take place at the Klerruu Teachers College in Iringa <#/>And this the opening ceremony will be on the sixteenth September nineteen ninety-one <#/>That is next Monday and uh in the afternoon we\rquote 
ll continue with a seminar which will end on the twenty-first of September nineteen ninety-one <#/>We are not yet sure about the guest of honour
\par <$A> <#/>And now back to the problems and setbacks Mathematical Association of Tanzania being a non-governmental organisation <#/>I\rquote 
m sure it has its successes but before we reach to success may you please give us a hint on what are the problems or setbacks that MAT is facing
\par <$B> <#/>As usual many subjects ar
e facing problems of textbooks problems of inadequate teachers and so on and so forth <#/>Mathematics is hard-hit because it is not easy to retain mathematics teachers in the teaching profession <#/>And uh to be able to tackle the problem of uh lack of re

e tried to raise funds through charity work and other activities and by so doing they could acquire teaching materials and uh make teaching material using locally available material <#/>But this is very inadequate <#/>To publish books people have tried to
 
write manuscripts but they face the problem of having these manuscripts published <#/>Again the standard of teachers themselves is not adequate <#/>To do to be able to raise it one has to organise in-service training courses <#/>Now these have been organi
sed on }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057 
 ad-hoc-basis because the finances were not there <#/>So when we get a little bit of <-_finances><+_finance> from some donors we do that <#/>So our major setback has been lack of funds and the budget allocations to the ministries to whom w
e run for <-_finances><+_finance> has been getting tighter and tighter and this has caused a decline in the amount of resources we could get from them
\par <$A> <#/>Dr Massanga you being the chairperson of the Mathematical Association of Tanzania we understand}{\b\fs24\lang2057  }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  that the problem when}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_it>}{
\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 is known and a solution is found then you get successes <#/>But before you reach to successes may you first just tell us have you ever received any assistance from some of the outside non-governmental organisations 
like MAT and especially on the problems that you have mentioned or the setbacks that you have mentioned because the biggest you have mentioned is the finance <#/>Is there any international non-governmental organisation that has given you any assistance fi
nancially
\par <$B> <#/>Uh in the past we used to get uh very little funds }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 
from various donors like the International Centre for Theoretical Physics and uh UNESCO and the others to finance our <./>seminar our annual seminars <#/>But this was very litt
le indeed <#/>But recently we have entered a contract with the Harold Macmillan trust of London and uh this is for a three-year project <#/>This project is for publication of our teaching material that is book }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{
\fs24\lang2057  for secondary education as well as
 uh bulletins and news letters <#/>Also it is for in-service training which is to be spread throughout the different zones <#/>The project is half funded by the European Community <#/>We are still looking for the other half
\par <$A> <#/>Thank you very much <#/
>Now to the successes <#/>I understand that having problems and having solutions of solving these uh problems then come successes <#/>I wonder whether the Mathematical Association of Tanzania has ever met with any successes so far in the in its twenty-fiv
e years of its existence
\par <$B> <#/>Well it is not easy to measure the success particularly where uh the number of mathematics students is increasing much more rapidly than the number of the teachers <#/>Even the number of the increased teachers is not retain
ed in the teaching <#/>But we feel without the efforts of MAT I think the situation would have been worse because the seminars we organise annually attract a lot of the teachers and teachers gain a lot from them because they are some kind of an in-service
 
training <#/>The bulletins we produce are reading material to the students to <-/>to the <./>pu <-_>to the<-/> teachers The junior <-_bulletin><+_bulletins> also are reading materials to the students <#/>The well we talked about the bulletin and uh the co
n
test we <-/>we organise the prizes we award these competitions and all that <#/>They stimulate interest in the students <#/>And uh I feel that MAT has done quite a lot towards uh sustaining the subject and they're trying to interest more students <-_into>

\par <$A> <#/>Dr <name/> Massanga before we end this <./>pro programme uh I have something uh in person and that is about yourself <#/>You being the national chairperson of the Mathematical Association of Tanzania maybe some of the me
mbers who do not know uh you well would like at least to know your historical background <#/>We have just told them that you are the senior lecturer at the Mathematics Department at the University of Dar es Salaam <#/>But people may like to know more abou
t you <#/>May you now give us a hint as to where did you study and what did you take while you were in your university or any other uh institution
\par <$B> <#/>Yes well I did my primary education in Mwanza and then my secondary education <name/> Secondary Schoo
l and then <name/> College which was there later <name/> Secondary School <#/>Then I did my A levels at <name/> Secondary School <#/>I finished my <O/> nineteen seventy-two and started my Standard One in nineteen sixty-six <#/>Then I joined the University
 
of Dar es Salaam in seventy-three after coming from <O/> National Service <#/>And there I took uh mathematics physics statistics first year <#/>Second year I majored in maths and uh physics <#/>Then I <./>jo immediately after my completion I joined the Ma
t
hematics Department as a tutorial assistant <#/>That was in July uh April nineteen seventy-six <#/>And in nineteen eighty I left for West <-_>German><+_Germany> where I did a language course and uh of German and then joined the Technical University of uh 
Berlin <#/>And I did my PhD in free dynamics at the Technical University of Berlin <#/>Then I returned home and continued teaching <O/> in mathematics
\par <$A> <#/>Dr <name/> Massanga thank you very much for that uh brief historical background of yours But now 
maybe again another personal question <#/>And this one is on the problems your personal problems in lecturing and especially lecturing in mathematics <#/>A lot of people uh very fear }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 that maybe for a woman to take such a field as a lecturer in mathematics uh some of us may think that women always are having }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 a lot of things to do <#/>How do you combine your personal or private work and these well the job of lecturing at the mathematics department in the University of Dar es Salaam
\par <$B
> <#/>Well uh what I can tell you is that uh when I joined the university my whole first year academic year I was pregnant <#/>And uh I combined that with my studies and I got my baby and uh the second year was tougher because I was breast-feeding and I h
a
d to go to the university and come home uh downtown to look after the <-/>the child <#/>And I got my son uh just when I registered for my Master <#/>That was my second child <#/>My third child I did my PhD exam today and the following day I was admitted f
o
r delivery in hospital <#/>So uh what I want to say is that I got three children while I was doing my three degrees <#/>Uh it was not uh as easy as one could think of but I feel one can combine the two ideals and I succeeded <#/>My major problem actually 
is not uh all the maternal and marital responsibility which I have uh <#/>My major problem is all the prejudice <#/>The prejudice which is there that you\rquote re a woman it\rquote s not easy for you to do mathematics you have to prove beyond 
\par <$A> <#/>doubt
\par <$B> <#/>doubt that you can do mathematics <#/>This problem I felt it }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  a lot more when I was in <-_German><+_Germany> because I had to look for a supervisor and I went around and it was not easy to get one 
<X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 When I got one I mean I went to one person who sai
d look mathematics is very difficult It's difficult for even for men You see for Blacks they're more difficult Now from Tanzania mhm and a woman for that matter You see that means I was 
\par <$A> <#/>Yeah you were something in brackets
\par <$B> <#/>Yes and my level is the lowest point on the curve because I\rquote m a woman Yeah such kind of things such kind of prejudices uh throughout the system be it in Europe be it here and these are greater hurdles to meet because you don\rquote 
t know this other person\rquote s attitude and it is 
uh you have to change his attitude before you are accepted or acknowledged Now definitely the <./>mat maternal problems also affect one's progress because when you have a child you are breast-feeding you cannot attend conferences as the others You cannot 
go for study tours You have to think twice before you do that Definitely that affects your profession But uh I think I would like to encourage my fellow women that this can be done this can be combined and uh I wouldn\rquote 
t like to give up my maternal responsibilities as well as not to give up my professional responsibilities
\par <$A> <#/>Dr <name/> Massanga senior lecturer Mathematics Department of the University of Dar es Salaam and the national chairperson of the Mathematics Association of Tanzania we thank you v
ery much for that very good and nice uh brief especially on yourself Back now to our conversation And this time I would like you to tell us what are the future plans of the Mathematical Association of Tanzania
\par <$B> <#/>Yeah The future plans of MAT are firs
t we would like to find an effective way of getting across our recommendations and resolutions to the policy-makers You see because we also act as an advisory body to these people because really we are the people who are actually with the students who are
 
actually in the teaching So the problems faced there are best known by the mathematics teachers We have made recommendations year in year out and very little has been done A number of researches have been made by our members for instance on why do teacher
s
 run away from certain regions why do they run away from teaching and all that The researches have been done recommendations have been made sent to the policy-makers but we feel very little is being done That is one Second our future plan our second futur
e plan is self-<-_sufficience><+_sufficiency> in resources I mention resources This project with HMT which is co-funded by the European Community aims at paving }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 way to financial self-<-_sufficience><+_sufficiency> through members' initiatives And we will concentrate on production of books on }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 commercial basis and production of other materials of mathematical materials on }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  commercial basis and we hope that in the near future we will be self-sufficient These are the two future plans

the government intends to bring development among the people in this s
ociety <#/>That kind of a research was therefore conducted in Shinyanga rural district between nineteen ninety and nineteen ninety-two <#/>Ave Maria <name/> was one of the members who participated in the research <#/>In this interview with Radio Tanzania'
s Tenzi <name/> Ave Maria talks among other things }{\b\v\fs24 <+_about>}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 the objectives and what has been discovered out of the research
\par <$B> <#/>uh The major objectives of the research was first }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 to produce a gender profile on issues concerning women such a
s socio-economic and cultural and traditional elements of the area <#/>And secondly was to <O/> of energy supply and use of water <./>supp energy supply and useand water supply <#/>Thirdly it was traditional management and control strategies of the natura
l
 resources uh <#/>Fourth it was to look at the constraints for women participation in the management and control of the environment or land such as land water forest etcetera <#/>And fifthly it was to propose action plan for women in Shinyanga Soil Conser
vation and Aforestation Project which is SHISCAP 
\par <$C> <#/>We hope with Ave Maria such a research might be useful in future in case the possible solutions are found to bring about change in the society <#/>Now what major environmental problems have you discovered still affecting people in Shinyanga

\par <$B> <#/>Uh to be sincere because we went there for a special task so the first thing which we discovered in Shinyanga this was during our pilot study in nineteen ninety <#/>First o
f all we found that at least the problems which were announced there uh <#/>The staff were just left to know they're just <./>gradua they're foresters <#/>They are technical people foresters and nobody cared about giving them the human element how to go a
b
out dealing with uh people you know <#/>So it was really difficult for them to <./>co <-/>to communicate the message to the people so that it was the first issue which we discovered <#/>Secondly it was uh this problem of socio-cultural boundaries you unde
r
stand because the Sokumas are very closed society <#/>So in order to penetrate them uh you really need to <-/>to be among them <#/>This thing was really difficult for project people in Shinyanga because first they lack transport to go there and also some 
u
h incentives to make them go and spend more time in the villages <#/>So it was again another constraint towards achievement of these programmes <#/>Thirdly we found that uh most of these projects were <?/>top down <#/>We found that people just sit somewhe
re and they think that these people they have this problem }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 now how are we going to solve them <#/>You just send them uh sent people to introduce maybe <?/>central conservation without prior consultation with the people <#/>So you find that peopl
e participation was lacking <#/>Uh and uh fourthly you find that women were not involved in }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 planning of this project while at the end they were supposed to be implementers and this in <./>ma <-/>in most cases was due to the fact that the Sokuma
 culture is you know it's biased against women women are not supposed to appear in the public <#/>So whenever there is something to discuss and decide it is always men who <-_does><+_do> so <#/>So that was another constraint <#/>And uh fifthly when we wen
t
 there we found <#/>that there were too many uh institutions and projects which were dealing with uh the same issue of environment but there was no coordination between them <#/>So we found that this is a problem because you find that today it is <?/>Hash
i
 going there tomorrow it is uh World Vision International <#/>So it was like competing on the same person <#/>So instead of helping it was like you know sabotaging each other's work which we didn't see as a <-/>a healthy situation <#/>So we're seeking may
b
e a coordinating body to be installed in the area <#/>And sixthly it was that those conserved <-_area><+_areas> lacked protection because we went there <?/>Hashi was spending a lot of time and uh council district council spent a lot of time and resources 
t
o establish these <?/>central conservation <-/>conserv conserved areas but you find that after they regenerate people now start sending their cattle there and you find that personnel you find in every division <#/>I think there was only one personnel who 
i
s not enough to <./>sa <-/>to ensure the security of these uh uh reserved uh plots <#/>So for us that was a constraint but also for this uh we can link it with the people's participation because if they were really involved in the whole process they were 
supposed to be the uh <-/>the security to provide the security for these <-_area><+_areas> <#/>So those are the main constraints which we discovered and which took us to the main study now which took us uh two years to complete
\par <$C> <#/>Apart from the constraints you mentioned I'm sure talking to the respondents they might probably uh mention certain measures they take to conserve the environment or to control environmental problems <#/>What are they
\par <$B> <#/>Uh there are some individuals who you know when w
e are talking about these problems but uh they were not universal <#/>They are people who really benefited from these programmes especially from uh uh Roman Catholic Mission from <?/>Hashi and from district council <#/>You find some individuals who have s
t
arted uh <?/>central conservation within their plots <#/>They are those who have uh decided to start agro-forestry on their personal plots and you'll find some who have decided to prepare these controls and what-not in <-/>in the process of just trying to
 
conserve the land from erosion <#/>And there are also some institution which decided to pick up from <?/>Hashi and started to mobilize again the people at the societal level <#/>And here I would like to cite an example of Mipa Catholic Mission in Mondo Di
v
ision <#/>Uh this church there are two padres there who are Sokumas but not from that area but after seeing that problem they decided to mobilize these people and for them first they used uh these used clothes <ea/>mitumba <#/>So after some time that thin
g
 became internalized in them and uh in fact it is a very successful project which is co-owned or co-managed by the church and the village government <#/>Uh out of that conserved area the villages managed to purchase uh a milling machine from the village f
o
r that solving another problem which we are facing uh the people there because they didn't have a milling machine before and now they are trying to solve water problem by creating a dam because they have a season uh <-/>season river which passes through t
h
eir village but unfortunately it is dry during the dry season <#/>So they were mobilizing the mission was trying to mobilize some funds because it is very expensive to build a dam to get some external sources of funding so that they can establish that uh 
d
am <#/>So so far you find that there are some <-_institution><+_institutions> which have decided to take up these issues from these technical people and some individuals also who have decided again to <-/>to solve this environmental problem on the family 
level <#/>So this is what we discovered 
\par <$C> <#/>These are your personal efforts Ave Maria but I would now like to know what are your recommendation as far as environmental problems are concerned
\par <$B> <#/>Uh what we recommended even for that very SHISCAP p
roject first of all we said people's participation was very crucial <#/>Uh we said first those people who were involved in those projects should go and see traditionally how these people were managing their environment because when we were there people we
r
e talking about some other methodology whereby they used to <-/>to conserve the land to conserve the soil <#/>So I think it was unfair for somebody just to come and say you have to introduce a <?/>central conservation you have to plant maybe lucina or wha
t
 <#/>So you said maybe go back to the people discuss with them about their <-_method><+_methods> and then try to improve on them <#/>That was first <#/>Secondly it is the type of trees to be planted <#/>Many people there were reserved in fact about the ty
p
e of trees which were provided by these environmentalists <#/>For them they would prefer traditional trees which uh commonly and have wider use <#/>So for them this lucina was really very not very uh <-/>very good for them but uh they wanted eucalyptus an
d
 what these trees which can produce maybe timber uh which can provide fodder for their animals something like that but I don't know what was their reservation about lucina but they were really against lucina <#/>Uh another thing which we proposed again is
 
that uh for water sources maybe it is better to go back again and reintroduce the <?/>melanpo because it is very difficult to separate Sokuma from uh his or her <O/> <#/>So always when we were talking about Sokuma we are talking about him her and her <O/>
 
<#/>So to us for us we propose that maybe the <?/>melanpo system be reintroduced in the village so that they can manage to participate because up to now you find that during the dry season young men migrate with the cattle southwards to go and look for pa
s
ture there while here now are left back women and old people <#/>So this is really another problem because you know the family is not together throughout the year <#/>So that was uh another recommendation which we proposed <#/>And again thirdly we said th
a
t there was a need to coordinate these environmental management uh projects and for us we said since <?/>Hashi was farther than Shinyanga it was best because it was in the position in fact if empowered it is in a position to coordinate even this church or
ganization or whatever because for the <./>per they started I think they were on the right track provided that they are given some uh <-/>some uh powers <./>economic economically }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>laughter}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 
empowered at least to carry out their activities because they wer
e really constrained in terms of resources <#/>Even the district council uh they couldn't do much because the district forest officer I think natural resource officer had a motorcycle while those in the division had bicycles which is really cannot manage 
the harsh condition of Shinyanga }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  <#/>So those were some of the <-_proposition><+_propositions> which we made and because others were very specific to SHISCAP project
\par <$C> <#/>I have another interesting question Ave <#/>You know that whenever you
 do a research you have hopes of a possible solution to the problem <#/>Uh now how did you manage to convince people in Shinyanga that their problems are getting to be solved soon
\par <$B> <#/>In fact uh during that research we were doing both uh sensitization and research <#/>So during our research we used also to try and educate}{\b\fs24  }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24 
 them the importance of having those projects like <?/>Hashi within their locality and uh the importance of them <./>particip their participation fully because we said these people of <?/>Hashi you are just blaming them for nothing because first of all th
ey are not Sokumas <#/>Their region doesn't have this desertification problem <#/>They are here to assist you so unless you cooperate if you think this methodology is not good for you sit down and discuss with them but not to start sabotaging }{\b\v\fs24 
<&/>grammar}{\fs24  <#
/>In fact if you are sabotaging a <./>pro <-/>a programme it means you are just sabotaging your development <#/>So we used to go and campaign like that <#/>So for us we think that people's participation is more crucial and nobody can go and solve the prob
l
em of uh environment in Shinyanga except for Shinyanga people themselves <#/>Others will just come to assist and give them direction but the problem will be solved by themselves <#/>So this is what we used to campaign to them and in fact for these few who
 
have decided to take up this environmental management on their family level we decided to take them as an example in fact <#/>Even during our dissemination seminar we invited them and they gave their personal you know views <#/>So it was really of help be
cause they say ha so this is my colleague he's my neighbour and he's doing wonderful things to solve his or her problem <#/>Why not me <X_>}{\v\fs24 
So we used that methodology to try to enlighten others on the importance of <./>particip participation in the management of the environment}{\fs24 
\par }{\v\fs24 <$C> <#/>Since we started sensitizing people about the environmental issues we used different methods uh research is one of them making researches uh Seminars in the workshops to create awareness to people about environmental issues have 
also been conducted But we have not achieved much so far What are your comments to the government
\par <$B> <#/>Uh that is very true and the main reason maybe is that after doing our research in most cases those reports end up <-_in><+_on> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\v\fs24 our shelves or <-_in><+_on> }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{
\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\v\fs24 
the ministry's shelf and what not That is the end of that research But in our case first of all before producing the final report we decided to organize a dissemination seminar in Shinyanga And there we invited uh representatives f
rom all the villages we visited which <-_was><+_were> in Shinyanga rural district And also we invited some few outstanding uh environmentalists people individuals we identified during the research We invited the institutions which are dealing with environ
m
ental management and the government people They are in the district and uh regional level And we discussedwe presented our findings there and we discussed with them We made some addition and uh you know things which we they thought that are not to appear 
i
n our report and then we produced the final report That was stage one Stage two we are now in a process of publishing that report When we because you know when you are being commissioned and you are given terms of reference you have to act according to te
r
ms of reference And our report is very thick and huge Anybody who sees it you know can <?/>repair But uh now we are in a process in fact of publishing it in both Swahili and English The English version is aimed at first to provide literature at the univer
s
ity level and secondary school where they want to start these environmental studies And the Kiswahili version is mainly will <-/>will mainly concern trying to educate we uh people about the problem which Shinyanga is facing In fact we are on this book whi
c
h we are planning we are we want to try at least to add the experience of one or two more regions on this very issue and we are going to use the same pattern of information gathering techniques which we used in Shinyanga <O/> so that when we produce at le
a
st it becomes a representative sample So there are issues which we are going to take from this huge report and publish it in Swahili And it is our expectation that after being used maybe the regions which are still okay environmentally the environment is 
s
till balanced they might take measures before it is too late because up to now if you go southward in Iringa in Mbeya Rukwa and Ruvuma the rate of tree felling is very high I think we need to disseminate information that even in Shinyange that is how they
 
started They started by saying that we are reclaiming our uh you know this thing uh tsetse fly control Then it came as we are felling trees for cotton production But now it is semi-desert and it is going to be the same in those regions unless this informa
tion is communicated people might just take it for granted So that is our future planning and we are trying we have already started working up on it and looking for possible funding
\par <$C> <#/>What are your comments here also as far as gender and environmental management is concerned 
\par <$B> <#/>Uh on that uh issue I think we are still very far }{\b\v\fs24 <+_behind>}{\v\fs24  because equality on that issue is yet to be achieved While we find men the major uh depleters of the environment you know when we are talking about }{\b\v\fs24 
<+_article>}{\v\fs24  timber uh business it is men's business When we are talking about }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\v\fs24 
 charcoal business it is men's business and these are the major <-_source><+_sources> of environmental degradation in our country But when it comes now to the management the cons
ervation <./>mea <-_>the conservation<-/> measures that is where women now come }{\b\v\fs24 <+_in>}{\v\fs24  You find that whenever you start }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\v\fs24 
 environmental management <./>pro programme always ah we want to have the women component in it So in every village which we 
visited we found that ah there is a women wood lot there and a village wood lot there But the major labour force behind both uh village wood lot and the women wood lot it is women again So I think there is no equality as far as environmental management is
 
concerned So this is to me uh I think uh a very big bottle-neck and in fact I would uh <-_>I would<-/> rather advise those people who are concerned with these environmental management programmes or projects to try and see how men will be <-_>will be<-/> i
n
volved more because up to now they are just involved in uh cutting trees and what-not But when it comes to conservation measures which are non-profitable they don't have direct profit for those who are conserving the environment men are not there because 
e
ven in this conserved woodlot you find that after they regenerate it is men who send their cattle there Women cultivate and weed those plots When they regenerate men take their cattle to feed there Men are given permit to go and cut poles from those wood 
lots but women will be banned from taking uh firewood from those conserved <-_area><+_areas> So I think we are still biased against women on that issue Gender balance is not yet achieved
\par <$C> <#/>The problem of fuel wood is inevitable and I think women in the rural areas will keep on walking a long distance to search for firewood Do you have an idea of}{\b\v\fs24  <+_article>}{\v\fs24 
 alternative source of energy probably a traditional one 
\par <$B> <#/>Uh to be sincere during the term of this study we were talking about environment
al conservation but at least we are hopeful uh when we referred to uh Tanesco's claim that rural electrification by the year two thousand So we hope that when the rural areas the electricity <-_reach><+_reaches> the rural areas at least this domestic uh e
n
ergy would be solved the problem of domestic energy would be solved and uh in fact would be in a better position to conserve the environment because even in town I think the major users of charcoal are people in the urban areas But uh for that time we pro
pose that maybe if it was possible and if <O/> was really serious we propose that they <-/>they try to look for }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\v\fs24 
 alternative source of energy meanwhile and we propose that maybe they build a briquette uh factory in Shinyanga These briquettes usua
lly briqettes are made out of uh this uh refuse and other uh wastes which are pressed together to come out as pieces and they are used as }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\v\fs24 
 source of domestic energy But unfortunately that seemed to be a very expensive project then they were not in fact it was out of our terms of reference because we were not asked to suggest }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\v\fs24 
 alternative source of energy but in fact we just decided that this was very important if you <-/>you are really serious about the issue of environmental conservat
ion and management in Shinyanga district So the use of briquette is another proposal which we proposed Thirdly we said maybe we sell an idea to scientists to go and see how they can <./>impro improve on <<ea/><O/>this cow dung which is widely now used in 
Shinyanga but it is really very toxic to the user because it produces a lot of smoke heavy smoke and it is smelling }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar/aspect}{\v\fs24  you know badly So those who are using }{\b\v\fs24 <+_it>}{\v\fs24  usually they have red eyes }{
\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24  If you've been hearing }{\b\v\fs24 <+_of>}{\v\fs24  women in Shinyanga being killed because of uh being accused that they are having red eyes }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar/aspect}{\v\fs24 
 and for that matter they are witches So witch-killing is very common in Shinyanga and in most cases is due to this environmental <-/>environmental problem which is there }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24 
 In fact the explanation is more than that but that uh shortage of fuel wood also <-_add><+_adds> to that So that is part of another of a suggestion which we made Maybe scientists should look on the way to improve <ea/><O/> which 
is a bit cheap and more affordable to people in Shinyanga

\par <I> <$A> <#/>let's join <name/> as she interviews the unit's coordinator Mrs Georgina Bundala who begins by giving us a two-pronged approach to involve women in economic activities
\par <$B> <#/>The first approach is involvement of women in the development projects which are taking place in the region by mobilizing them to participate in uh identifying planning implemen
tation and evaluation of the development projects which are taking place in their region <#/>Such a development project involves the road and the housing construction work-up project primary health care agriculture food and nutrition project authorization
 project and the education approach project <#/>The second approach is to establish specific projects for women <#/>These are income-generating projects shops restaurants <O/> and the other agricultural projects 
\par <$A> <#/>You also mentioned that the women a
re also involved in the road and the housing project and the <#/>we normally know that the road and housing projects are meant for men <#/>How did you manage to convince women to involve in road and housing activities
\par <$B> <#/>Actually according to the rou
te of approach there is no project which is meant for only for men <#/>I think every project meant for both women and men <#/>Actually here what we want to solve is the financial constraints which women are facing in the rural areas <#/>So when we are mob
i
lizing women to participate in these road works and housing construction we meant to try to raise their incomes so that they can afford to assist their families <#/>For example for paying of uniforms for their children to work with a supplement to help pr
ovide food for healthy living and so forth 
\par <$A> <#/>Uh it's nice to know that here we have certain projects and one a group of women wants to establish but it's sometimes capital that stumbles the group <#/>What efforts are you taking to save such a programme
\par <$B> <#/>The efforts which were taken to to solve such problems is to establish a fund within the programme <#/>This fund is used to support the income-generating projects which are established by women <#/>The women are mobilizing themselves at villag
e level and then come up with applications to our office and then our office go back to the villages to assess what is going on at the village level and then the women uh are asked to fill in our forms and those groups which qualify for support they are g
etting the support from this fund
\par <$A> <#/>Mrs Bundala we know that the <name/> region is a very large region or a very large area which has four districts that is Mkasi Mpanda Sabarandarua and Sabarandaaban <#/>Okay apart from the town centre you are suppo
sed to go to the village to mobilize women or to sensitize women to involve in income-generating activities <#/>Now how far have you succeeded to sensitize these women to involve themselves in income generating activities
\par <$B> <#/>Actually we <-/>we uh hav
e the communicative development department which is supposed to mobilize the women for involving themselves in the income-generating activities <#/>We at the regional level we have the women in development roster within the regional communicative developm
e
nt office <#/>At the district level we have got the women in development roster within the district communicative development office down to the what level <#/>Every <-/>every ward should have one communicative development assistant who <-/>who is familia
r with the task of mobilizing women <#/>Up to now we have about one twenty groups which are already supported from our <O/> funds
\par <$A> <#/>Designated for women in <O/> <#/>How do you manage to make sure women benefit from the project
\par <$B> <#/>As a women's c
oordinator within this programme my role uh to help to advise the regional planning officer and the rural coordinators as well on what resources are needed to improve the situation of women in the region <#/>And secondly my role is to make sure that every
 
established project has direct benefits to women and that every project roster has a plan to involve women from identification planning up to the implementation of the project <#/>From my desk I prepared the policy document and at a great length which is 
assisting the department to know how they can plan the activities which are gender sensitive
\par <$A> <#/>Can you give us examples of the projects which you were meant for men but you are trying to make it to make sure that the women also benefit 
\par <$B> <#/>For example within the programme we have got the district development fund which was was established to support the infrastructure projects which are taking place in the districts <#/>Those infrastructure projects include the construction of vill
a
ge offices the construction of dispensaries at the village level the construction of uh clinics the construction of a school classroom teachers' housing and so forth <#/>When the fund was introduced when we are going up to the village to mobilize the peop
l
e for coming up with their applications for getting support the people at the village level uh through seminars and workshops are encouraged to establish the projects which are beneficial to both men and women <#/>For example the men can come up with the 
i
dea that they want to construct the office for the village <#/>While at the same time there is no health services in the same village <#/>So we try to advise them that they should at least consider the women who are struggling all day to find health servi
c
es for their children <#/>So we advise the villages to come up with a proposal for constructing the dispensary rather than the village office <#/>Another example is that for example if they they want to construct the dormitory to the secondary school <#/>
There is both male and female students at the secondary school <#/>So when they they want to establish uh to construct the dormitory which is their both dormitory we try to advise them to also to consider the female gender when constructing the dormitory

\par <$A> <#/><X_> }{\v\fs24 Socialism and literature It's a very big subject and it isn't surprising that we didn't say all tha
t we felt that we would like to last time but we did get on to a number of questions which we hope it will be of interest if we continue on and raise in from perhaps rather different points of view and one of the questions that we discussed last time was 
t
he whole question of the development of Swahili literature which we agreed was the key question because after all the main thing about literature in any country is that people should read it be able to read it and should read it in their own language beca
u
se they will never be feel the same towards any other language and why should they and so we want to get back to this question of the development of Swahili literature and uh whereas last time I did most of the talking I hope this time that the Tanzanian 
members of the group whose language this is are are going uh to do most of the talking so I\rquote m going to ask Mr Shija if he he\rquote ll develop some of the points which he made last time about the need to develop confidence in Swahili literature}{
\fs24 </X>
\par <$B> <#/>One fa
ct is predominant and that is that Tanzania has a good amount of literature written in Swahili <#/>Now our aim should be first to increase this literature and the second point should be to enrich the language uh of our literature <#/>Now before uh the fac
t has been that people have tended to <-/>to deny the use of Swahili or they tended to <-/>to treat it as being less of an important language <&/>}{\b\fs24 grammar}{\fs24 
 <#/>Therefore I feel that Swahili should be the medium of <-/>of our literature in Tanzania <#/>Uh I un
derstand that uh we have to consider the role of Swahili in developing literature and culture above all <#/>We understand that at the moment we have some books written in Swahili <#/>We have good poetry written in Swahili but the problem is one of making 
i
t understandable to most of the people <#/>Now as we last I mean last week we tried to talk about the question of adaptation and translations and today we want to move it a bit further and that is get people to write in Swahili and consider the problems t
hat there might be when we ask them to write in Swahili
\par <$A> <X_>}{\v\fs24 <#/>}{\v\fs24 What do you think those main problems are uh Do you think that it\rquote s largely a matter of confidence or do you think uh that there are real objective difficulties in developing Swahili as literary language}{\fs24 </X>

\par <$B> <#/>I feel that a writer who is going to use Swahili as a medium of uh of his literature uh will feel more confident uh in using the language and on the other hand I feel that uh this literature will be read by a greater number of 
people in the country and uh we also feel that English or French should uh kind of be limited because uh the <-/>the trend has been that uh most people have tended to use English as the medium of instruction and medium of <-/>of literature not because the
y don\rquote t feel confident in using Swahili but because they feel that their books will have a <-/>a larger market
\par <$A><X_>}{\v\fs24 <#/}{\v\fs24 >}{\fs24 Y}{\v\fs24 ou feel it\rquote s largely that do you that they they they they feel they will have a bigger audience if they write in English or French}{\fs24 </X>
\par <$B> <#/>Yes I think so
\par <$A> <X_>}{\v\fs24 <#/>}{\v\fs24 In Africa included because there is a problem here isn\rquote t there that in many parts of Africa uh much of the literature for some time is likely to be written in either English or French}{\fs24 </X>
\par <$B> <#/>Well as far as the 
<-/>the situation is in Tanzania is concerned we ought to be first of all proud of this language Kiswahili and we should <-_>we should<-/> be able to <-/>to make use of our intellect and uh literary creativeness to <-/>to <-/>to utilise this language enri
ch it and expand it
\par <$A><X_>}{\v\fs24 <#/>}{\v\fs24 Can you think of any particular ways that would help in giving people more confidence in the use of their own language What do you think Mister <name/> Njoroge}{\fs24 </X>
\par <$C> <#/>Uh I <-_>uh I<-/> fully endorse the idea of helping
 people to write in Swahili because primarily most of the people in Tanzania speak Swahili <#/>And those who know English are only confined to a very small number who go to school <#/>Now while encouraging the idea of helping people to write Swahili we ha
ve to realise the problems that we are facing and that is first of all we do not have an adequate training }{\b\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  for one to write in Swahili and while I will accept Mr Shija\rquote 
s point that some might be I mean might be writing in English or French purel
y for economic reasons and wanting an international audience I think there is also this question of one's feeling comfortable in the medium of expression and for some of the themes that the writer might want to write about might want to <-/>to express him
self some of them are so modern and they're confined to a very narrow segment of the society
\par <$A> <X_>}{\v\fs24 <#/>}{\v\fs24 Is this a linguistic question do you think that uh I mean would you suggest that Swahili uh as a language uh isn\rquote t so flexible as to be able to include modern experience}{\fs24 </X>
\par <$B> <#/>I don\rquote t think it\rquote s a question of flexibility because I believe that a language will develop if people keep on using it and finding new venues for it but at the moment there is not that sense of direction <#/>We are now recov
ering it and I think it\rquote s going to be profitable in the end
\par <$A><X_>}{\v\fs24 <#/>}{\v\fs24 I feel sure that this must be right I\rquote m I\rquote m quite certain uh from the little I know of the Swahili literature of the past that it has a tradition which uh uh Africans can draw on with
 great value and I would've thought that it was largely a question of developing practice and confidence uh and uh that this needs actual leadership and political decisions taken It isn't sufficient I would've thought just to say we ought to have more Swa
hili there must be practical ways of encouraging people to write now I wonder if Mister Shija has anything to say about that}{\fs24 </X>
\par <$B> <#/>One of the things is the Ministry of Education should be concerned with this affair that is it must encourage the use o
f Swahili in all schools in Tanzania and the teachers who are going to <-/>to teach the language should be people who are well versed in the language itself <#/>They should be able to <-/>to know the <-/>the how <-/>how <-/>how well it can be used uh in t
h
e literature how well the grammar can be used in <-/>in the writing of <-/>of the language itself because I feel that the there is a hangover from the colonial past whereby people have tended to regard English and French as being superior to Swahili <#/>N
o
w this is the time when people should feel uh uh cautious of the fact that this language should be developed <#/>They should feel concerned and they should be committed to <-/>to using Swahili as a medium of <-/>of their literature <#/>Otherwise I fear th
at <./>lit the <-/>the language of <-/>of Kiswahili will not develop or will not expand from the <-/>the boundaries of Tanzania
\par <$A><X_>}{\v\fs24 <#/>}{\v\fs24 In other words you need not merely uh people who want to be writers but committed people people who uh feel a responsibility uh in their writing uh towards the development of their own national culture}{\fs24 </X>
\par <$B> <#/>Here lies the <-/>the main point <#/>In fact that's <-/>that's quite true that people should feel proud of this language <#/>People should be able to express
 themselves with a confidence in this language and <-/>and people should be committed to using Swahili as a medium of <-/>of <-/>of <-/>of literature 
\par <$A><X_>}{\v\fs24 <#/>}{\v\fs24 Do you see uh many examples yet of uh books poems articles in Swahili that are beginning to have a wide and inspiring effect on young writers}{\fs24 </X>
\par <$B> <#/>Yes for instance at the University College people are having }{\b\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  a <-/>a literature class where we will learn and discuss the <-/>the works of writers such as Shaaban Roberts and Mnyamp
ala <#/>Now this is a very good training for would-be writers in the future and uh we <-/>we also tend to find that it's easier we understand this literature more than uh the literature we used to learn in <-/>in uh English and we feel that this is more r
elevant to the culture of past and <-/>and what we aspire to in this country
\par <$A><X_>}{\v\fs24 <#/>}{\v\fs24 You'd agree with that would you}{\fs24 </X>
\par <$C> <#/>I would agree and I would only add this that we\rquote ve got to have a living tradition of Swahili and this has to be built and one thing which ought to be encouraged and I'll pick up some of Mr Shija\rquote 
s points is that we have a <./>nee <-/>a dire need for teachers who have been trained to <-/>to teach linguis
tics and these are the people who are I mean who can create a desire among the peoples themselves to <-/>to use Swahili and write Swahili and debate in Swahili very confidently 
\par <$A><X_>}{\v\fs24 <#/>}{\v\fs24 Well I'm very glad that in the course of the discussion among oth
er things the question's been raised uh of the teaching of Swahili literature at the University College because I get the impression that a good many people in Tanzania think that literature is just a subject uh in which we study the rather remoter works 
o
f English uh and of course this isn't true We are trying more and more to develop in the University College an approach to literature which is centred on what's relevant to Africans uh and among this is the uh development of Swahili literature and now our
 students take as part of their course uh a the uh programme that Mister Shija has mentioned uh which is specifically on uh literature in Swahili and this whole development is one which we consider very important}{\fs24 </X>
\par <$D> <X_>}{\v\fs24 <#/>}{\v\fs24 Well I'm sorry I must break in
to your discussion once again gentlemen uh you have been listening to a discussion on literature and socialism I'd like to thank Professor Kettle for presiding over the discussion and thank Mr <name/>Njoroge and Mr Shija for their valuable contributions B
