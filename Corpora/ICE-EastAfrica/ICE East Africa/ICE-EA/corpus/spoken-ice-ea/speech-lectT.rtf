this seminar <#/>Your Excellency the theme of our seminar has a convocational background <#/>In my presidential inaugural address delivered at the nineteenth general meeting of the convocation in August nineteen eighty-nine I had exclusively dwelt on the 
c
risis in our welfare state and had urged at that time that the convocation holds a seminar to address the crisis <#/>In that address Your Excellency I had pointed out that at time when the governments step fast commitment to the provision of free social s
e
rvices had suffered serious setbacks in the face of a debilitating economic crisis a free public service dependency syndrome had in turn entrenched itself in the social structure of our nation <#/>That dependency syndrome has given birth to mass demands a

 quality and this importance and this significance to the people of Tanzania and we think it earmarks uh a series of events which will gradually help transfer some of the social evils that we suffer from by action being taken appropriately at the appropri

 that I stand before you to thank his Excellency the President and the Chancellor of this university for their speeches just delivered this morning }{<#/>}{\lang2057 There are several reasons we ought to thank you Your Excellency Mr President }{<#/>}{
\lang2057 First and foremost we thank you through your deliberate leadership for creating a conducing environment in Tanzania for these types of discourses }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
It is the mark of the existence of a climate tolerant of free expression so central to democratic institutions }{<#/>}{\lang2057 For as you may 
recall the prophetic saying of the American president Abraham Lincoln delivered at Gettysburg in eighteen sixty-three to the effect that the Pilgrim Fathers brought forth to the American continental shores a people who yearned for democracy and therefore 
ready to lay down their lives and to call to him that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that the government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth and <O/> }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
What we see today Your Excellency is an attempt to relive that famous and wise statement made one and a quarter of a century ago half a world from us }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
We thank you for encouraging this sense of freedom to organise and express ourselves this way in the hope that this particular seminar organised by the Convocation will live up to the expectations of its members as well as those of the nation }{<#/>}{
\lang2057 Secondly we thank you for not only allowing this free expression of viewpoint so central to democratic society but for your personal involvement 
in the process your willingness to come to this university to meet and address members of Convocation the sole expression of your stand in this matter }{<#/>}{\lang2057 You could have chosen to turn down the invitation to open this seminar }{<#/>}{
\lang2057 You could have decided to ask someone else to address us but you did neither }{<#/>}{\lang2057 We are sure that this action of yours will inspire us for the duration of the seminar and for very much longer beyond these two days }{<#/>}{
\lang2057 Finally we thank you for the message contained in the text of your address }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
This set the tone for the rest of the seminar and through the ripple effect for any other seminar organised by Convocation in its zonal meetings across the length and breadth of Tanzania }{<#/>}{\lang2057 Indeed in the order of orders given the nature of 
this university former students are to be found in all corners of our earth }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
Finally on behalf of the Convocation on behalf of this august <O/> you have just addressed and on behalf of the whole university community we shall say <ea/>asante <ea/>sana <ea/><O/> }{<#/>}{\lang2057 Thank you Your Excellency </I>

t
reaties <#/>This workshop has thus come at an opportune moment Mr Chairman <#/>The expertise kindly provided by the World Intellectual Property Organisation and the wide representation offered by participants should enable this workshop to come up with re
c
ommendations that can help the government of the United Republic of Tanzania to review the copyright role and approach the treaties relating to intellectual property with greater clarity <#/>At this juncture I wish to commend the steps already taken by th

 National Arts Council the steps taken by the cultural sector to review the <./>copy <-/>the copyright act of nineteen sixty-six both of which have come up with proposals for updating the act and suggesting and suggestions for proper <./>admin administeri

r
sary <#/>Twenty years is not a very short period of time especially for such an important institution of higher learning in a young nation like ours which is in the process of implementing important development goals <#/>This university has an important r

n
ia and Strategies for More Sustainable System in the nineteen nineties is both timely and relevant <#/>This theme is relevant because the provision of essential social services to the people has been the <./>cons <-/>the consistent commitment of the gover
nment of Tanzania since }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article}{\v\lang2057 > }{\lang2057 
nineteen sixties <#/>In implementing that policy the government has invested substantial resources in the field of education health housing water supply and sanitation <#/>That was done with the valuable support and assis
tance of friendly countries some of which are represented at this seminar <#/>We thank them all for their assistance <#/>The results achieved are spectacular <#/>In the first two decades of our nation's history we managed to attain provision levels which 
r
eceived world-wide recognition In the field of education a massive universal primary education programme and adult education managed to raise our average literacy level from a low ten per cent in nineteen sixty-one to the present enviable level of ninety 
p
er cent <#/>The number of enrolment in primary schools as a <./>per <-/>a percentage of the school age has increased from twenty per cent to ninety-three per cent <#/>The spectacular expansion of this university is a good example of the government's commi
t
ment to promote higher education in our country <#/>The expansion has been in both the number of enrolment and in the number of faculties <#/>The University started with five faculties and one institute <#/>Today it has seven faculties and five institutes
 
<#/>In the field of health and nutrition an extensive facility network based on the cost on the least cost preventive approach was set up <#/>A health system based on village workers dispensaries rural health centres district regional and referral hospita
l
s was established <#/>The number of rural health centres rose from twenty-two to two hundred and sixty <#/>Dispensaries increased from eight hundred and seventy-five to four thousand six hundred and seventy-six and hospitals from one hundred and nineteen 
t
o one hundred and forty-nine <#/>That system greatly improved the access of all Tanzanians including those in the rural areas to modern health services <#/>The population served by one physician improved by twenty-two per cent and dropped from two <./>tho
u
s twenty-four thousand seven hundred to nineteen thousand two hundred and eighty <#/>The population served by one nurse improved remarkably and dropped fivefold from eleven thousand eight hundred ninety to a mere two thousand one hundred and <./>fo and ei
g
hty-four <#/>Generally life expectancy at birth improved from thirty-five to fifty years <#/>Infant mortality rate was reduced from about one hundred and ninety about to about one thirty-seven per one thousand live births <#/>As for water sector the objec
t
ive was to <./>prov to provide clean water to all the population in a thirty year programme spanning between nineteen seventy-one and two thousand and two <#/>It was hoped that by nineteen eighty seventy five per cent of the rural population would be serv
e
d with clean water <#/>Although this target was not reached by nineteen eighty eighty per cent of the urban population and forty-five per cent of the rural population had access to modern water services <#/>Mr Chairman in brief the achievements made in th
e development of those vital social services are remarkable <#/>Unfortunately the severe economic crisis which our country has been experiencing over the last decade has greatly eroded our ability to maintain them and have }{\b\v\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{
\v\lang2057  }{\lang2057 therefore sharply dete
riorated <#/>The manifestation of that deterioration are not hard to find <#/>The poor state of our physical infrastructure especially road and railways is a constant reminder of the <./>infa uh unfavourable economic situation prevailing in our country <#
/
>The networks of health services now perform poorly because of the lack of medicines and equipment <#/>Most water projects no longer function for lack of spare parts <#/>Equally affected by the economic crisis are our schools and universities which are fa
c
ed with an acute shortage of teaching aids and books <#/>As part of the Tanzanian community the University of Dar es Salaam has not been spared from that effect of the current <-/>current economic crisis <#/>That could be seen from the delapidated buildin
g
s and deterioration of essential services to the university community <#/>I'm pleased to note that work to rehabilitate those buildings is going on well <#/>Mr Chairman the persistent economic decline compelled the government to take difficult economic ad
j
ustments and recovery measures with the hope of reversing the negative trend <#/>I know that members of this audience are well versed with the measures taken <#/>Some of you have even conducted an assessment of the success of those measures <#/>So I will 
n
ot waste your time by repeating them <#/>However I would like to point out that implementation of those measures has produced positive signs for economic recovery <#/>Implementation of the first phase of the economic recovery programme ERP has especially 
h
elped to improve both agricultural and industrial production <#/>That has greatly reduced widespread shortages of essential commodities <#/>The spectacular increase in agricultural production has enabled our country to achieve food self-sufficiency and in
c
rease the volume of export commodities Industrial production has also increased by five per cent <#/>As a result of the increase in <./>agric agricultural and industrial production our gross domestic product has registered for the first time since ninetee
n
 seventy-eight an average of annual growth rate of four point one per cent well above the two per cent rate of population growth <#/>It is obvious from the foregoing that during the first phase of the ERP greater emphasis was placed on the improvement of 
p
roduction <#/>That was done in order to avert the danger of widespread hunger and to reduce the shortage of industrial goods <#/>In view of the limited resources at our disposal it was not possible to allocate adequate resources for the rehabilitation and
 
improvement of social services at the same time <#/>As a result people continued to <./>expe experience hardships <#/>That unfavourable situation compelled the government to adopt the priority of social action programme as a second phase of the ERP <#/>Wh
i
le in the first phase emphasis was put on improving production in the second phase emphasis is put on the rehabilitation and improvement of the greatly deteriorated social services <#/>In short the priority social action programme is intended to achieve t
h
e following objectives <#/>One to make institutional management and reforms which can improve the delivery of social services by creating an <O/> environment for improved efficiency accountability and mobilisation of community support and hence sustainabi
l
ity <#/>Two to restore an adequate supply of and effective demand for basic instructional materials in schools and to improve the learning environment by <./>reheb rehabilitating the delapidated buildings including those of this campus <#/>Three to restor
e
 an adequate supply of essential drugs and health care equipment in order to safeguard standards of provision of universal basic health services <#/>Four to rehabilitate the existing water facilities in order to provide improved access to safe water <#/>F
i
ve to improve the <./>distrib the <./>re the distribution of food from surplus areas to deficit areas so as to reduce the wide <./>mark marketing regions margins between producer and consumer prices for staple foodstuffs <#/>Six to accelerate the creation
 
of employment and income-generating activities in small-scale manufacturing and services <#/>Seven to support community-based public work schemes to create employment opportunities for low income people and improve their access to food and other essential
 
goods and services with preference being given to women <#/>Eight to provide nutritional safety nets if necessary for families who are unable to earn enough to buy on adequate an adequate amount of food <#/>Mr Chairman the government recognises that imple
m
entation of this phase as was the case for the first phase requires a massive injection of resources <#/>Unfortunately the country's revenue <./>reg uh generating capacity especially foreign exchange has not improved sufficiently enough to enable the gove
r
nment to allocate adequate resources to the social sector <#/>Our ability to earn sufficient uh foreign exchange continues to be affected by the persistent decline in world prices of our major export commodities and sharp increases in the prices of essent
i
al <./>impor imports including those required to improve social services <#/>It is therefore a matter of great satisfaction that the friendly countries and international <-_organisation><+_organisations> which gave us valuable <./>exper uh assistance duri
n
g the implementation of the first phase have also agreed to continue to help us with the implementation of the second phase <#/>For that reason I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of the government and people of Tanzania and on my own behalf t
o
 express our deep gratitude to those countries and <-_organisation><+_organisations> for their valuable assistance <#/>I would like to stress however that as much as we do appreciate the available assistance from our friends the rehabilitation <./>impro t
h
e rehabilitation improvement and maintenance of our social services remain the primary responsibility of the Tanzanians themselves each and everyone of us <#/>A more sustainable strategy for social service delivery must therefore be based on the active mo
b
ilisation and utilisation of our local resources and the intensification of our own efforts in compliance with our policy of socialism and self-reliance <#/>It is for that reason that the government continues to put great emphasis on communities' own resp
o
nsibility for their basic social services through self-help schemes <#/>Mr Chairman the priority action programme is now in its second year of implementation <#/>Those of you gathered here may wish to conduct a critical review of the progress so far made 
i
n the implementation of the programme <#/>Such a <-_>such a<-/> review would indeed be appropriate because this seminar has fortunately attracted participants from the <./>don the donor community the regions academicians participants practitioners and hig
h
 level public officials who are well versed with the crisis in our social services sector <#/>I feel confident that your review will help to identify those bottlenecks which hinder progress and recommend implementable measures which would help accelerate 
p
rogress towards better services to our people <#/>I wish to ensure you that the government will give serious consideration to all your recommendations <#/>I therefore wish <-/>wish you fruitful deliberations and declare the second seminar of the Convocati

\par <I> <#/>so uh yeah so I'm going to to try to give an analysis on the future of cooperatives with the development of <O/> }{\b\v <&/>cough}{\v  }{
agriculture in Tanzania uh <#/>My presentation will be divided into three parts <#/>The first I always try to expose the problem itself <./>re relating to the future of uh peasant cooperatives <#/>The second will be trying to show }{\b\v <+_article>}{\v  
}{historical perspective of the position and the role of peasant cooperatives and then the third will be just a conclusion as to what I think will be the future in terms of position and role of peasant c
ooperatives <#/>So beginning with the first part uh one aspect which is quite obvious to those who have come across the history of peasant cooperatives or development of cooperatives in Tanzania is that }{\b\v <&/>cough}{\v  }{
from the nineteen fifties uh during the per
iod of <./>Ger British colonialism uh peasant cooperatives assumed at least began to assume a monopoly a monopolistic role in the marketing of peasant crops and particularly uh the export crops uh <#/>Before that of course uh the people who were going int
o
 the marketing of peasant crops were private traders uh the so-called middleman traders who used to purchase peasant crops uh and sell them to the big uh export companies and that was the structure from the period of German colonialism to the first phase 
o
f British colonialism but in the nineteen <./>fif fifties the cooperatives began to take over particularly in the area of export crops the so-called cash crops that is coffee tea cotton pyrethrum tobacco cashnuts <#/>So that's where they began to assume t
h
e monopoly <#/>Now this has continued this <-/>this monopolistic tendency has continued uh up to the nineteen nineteen eighties so with the structural adjustment programme liberalisation in the privatisation programmes which we have been discussing here s
i
nce <-/>since yesterday <#/>So changes have begun to take place and these changes include uh now that private people again uh <./>where whereby the cooperatives in from the nineteen-fifties took over uh from the private traders <#/>Now they come in <#/>Th
e
y <-/>they come in again to play the same role they used to play in the past uh the marketing of peasant crops uh which means that uh from the mid-eighties uh up to now we have this development whereby uh private traders side by side with cooperatives uh 
a
re competing <#/>But there is a need to qualify the extent of that competition the extent to which that competition has reached up to this stage uh <#/>It is still at its lower level of development in the sense that much of the export <./>crop crops tradi
t
ional export crops have developed a system which is such that uh it's not easy for the private traders just to get in uh certain infrastructure structures <#/>If you have tobacco uh the <-/>the <-/>the cooperatives or the marketing boards own uh the proce
s
sing plants so a private trader to take over the marketing of tobacco will not be that <-/>that much easy <#/>Then there are <O/> <./>coff the beginning of <-/>of <-/>of <-/>of cotton uh and and other crops so <-/>so the level the extent to which uh the p
rivate people are entering into the competition very much depends on the <-_>on the<-/> nature of the crop uh on the circumstance of a particular area <#/>This one }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{\v  }{is as such most of them the competition has much more developed }

rms of fruit crops rather than in terms of uh traditional export crops <#/>Although even in that area still there are struggles uh <#/>For instance just by last year uh the regional governments of <name/> and <name/> uh decided to allow private traders to
 
enter into the marketing of cashnuts which up to now are still under the monopoly of cooperatives the <name/> Cooperative Union and the <name/> Cooperative Union who sell to the uh regional cashnut uh <./>pro product uh marketing board so that possibly th
i
s year the nineteen ninety-three ninety-four year uh the private traders are expected to be allowed to enter into that competition and in <name/> for instance the private traders have managed to take over completely the marketing of of cacao <#/>Now cacao
 
is a new <-_>a new<-/> crop there so it's not yet developed into a larger scale so it has been easy for the private traders Mohammed and Enterprise Limited has taken over completely from the <name/> and <name/> marketing union <#/>So <name/> and <name/> m
a
rketing union are remaining for the marketing of rice and uh uh coffee and uh cacao has been taken over by a private firm <#/>So uh this <O/> just some sure examples to show the way the process is going but then in the area food although also there <-/>th
e
re are some <-_>there are<-/> <-_>there are some<-/> <-/>some problems uh <#/>For instance in the four so-called four big <./>reg <O/> regions of <name/> Mbeya Rukwa and Iringa uh much of the maize for instance which is <-_>which is<-/> sold to Dar es Sal
a
am is bought by private traders there but part of it is still through cooperatives who sell to the National Union Cooperation you see <#/>So you you still have in the fruit crop area uh this competition in developing <#/>Now the <-/>the uh <-/>the actual 
p
roblem is is <-/>is <-/>is that uh uh first on the part of the cooperatives <#/><-_Historical><+_Historically> the cooperatives were particular cooperative unions were abolished nineteen seventy-six and then the uh crop authorities took over the position 
o
f crop uh uh cooperative unions so that it was the crop authorities which were now buying crops from primary cooperative societies in the villages which were now part of <O/> the development <O/> <#/>So the <-/>the effect of that abolition in nineteen sev
enty-six and then re-establishment of the <./>co <./>co cooperative unions in nineteen eighty-two uh uh after the act of nineteen eighty-two resulted <-_into><+_in> }{\b\v <&/>prep}{
 a situation whereby the cooperative unions began anew on a very weak capital base b
ecause when they were <-_>they were<-/> abolished they were abolished that <-_>sudden<+_suddenly> by <-/>by <-/>by the order of the government and then all their uh property financial uh movable the movable property was handed over to crop authorities <#/
>
So when they were re-established maybe they could get again the immovable property such as buildings uh but the movable and the <-_>and the<-/> financial capital uh was no longer there and therefore they had to start at a <-_>at a<-/> very weak position <
.
/>cap in terms of capital base to be able to to market peasant crops <#/>So the result of that they had to depend now borrowing from the National Bank of Commerce and the uh Cooperative Rural Development Bank in order to get financed to be able to purchas
e
 uh crops from the peasants <#/>So this tendency developed to the extent that uh because of the high rate of <-/>of <-/>of interest which they had to pay and also coupled with the corruption which developed within the cooperative unions themselves so the 
u
h <-/>the <-/>the there was a rapid rise of debts to the extent that by nineteen eighty-nine about eighty-fifty <./>eigh uh uh a survey of only seven cooperative unions amounted to a debt of fifteen billion shillings uh <#/>The cooperative unions could no
t pay and therefore the banks began to be strict }{\b\v <&/>prep}{ the cooperative unions so they had now to buy crops on credit so you <-/>you <-/>you <-/>you go to the peasants uh uh uh in fact by <-/>by last year the their cooperative unions }{\b\v 
<&/>noise}{\v  }{were negoti
ating very seriously to convince the peasants uh to <-/>to <-/>to sell their crops uh to the cooperative union on credit and you heard then their coffee is <-/>is <-/>is <-/>is sold on the world market <#/>When the money comes then they can pay the peasan
t
s <#/>And this has created a lot of problems in terms of relationship between the peasants and the cooperatives <#/>So this is uh one problem on the side of the cooperatives <#/>And then on the side of the private traders uh a rough survey indicates that 
o
nly <-/>only very few traders with strong capital base uh such as Mohammed and Enterprise and others but the majority are just petty traders who have very weak capital base <#/>So it is feasible when you go along the many roads to collect the maize to col
l
ect I don't know what uh and then uh sell it to the areas uh where they are demanded <#/>Now the problem is that uh these traders have not been able to satisfy uh the <-/>the <-/>the <-/>the <-/>the marketing needs of the crops <#/>For one because of the 
t
ransport infrastructure problem <#/>If they go uh deeper into the <-_>into the<-/> villages where you have got problems of transport that means uh transport expense will be very high and therefore they only choose areas where you have got easy access of t
ransport and therefore they can only uh purchase uh crops from one part of the peasants but the majority of the peasants have no access to these traders <#/>So this is uh one problem <#/>Given the weak capital base they can\rquote 
t buy large quantities <#/>So the
re have been cases where the cooperatives because of this also the cooperatives having financial problems they could not purchase crops from the peasants such as maize and because again the private traders have the weak capital base most of them they }{
\b\v <&/>grammar/subject}{\v  }{
could not satisfy uh uh the <-/>the supply of <-/>of crops from the peasants <#/>So you have a crisis situation and uh there are and and up to now there is no clear <-_>there is no clear<-/> government policy or guidance to regulate this typ
e of competition <#/>So this is uh one of the aspects of the problem <#/>But the other uh is that also connected with the private traders is the fact that the private traders are only interested in the crops while cooperatives had two roles purchasing cro
ps from the peasants marketing them and then ensuring that the peasants get uh some <./>ne <./>nec necassary inputs such as fertilizer uh and other uh necessary inputs <#/>But uh private traders have no interest <-_on><+_in> }{\b\v <&/>prep}{
 that and therefore thei
r interest is just to buy the crops <#/>So where cooperatives withdraw <-/>uhu the peasants have got a problem of getting inputs and the example I've told you about the cacao is facing that problem so that the Mohammed Enterprise Limited uh is only intere
s
ted in the buying of the crop and exporting it rather than helping the peasants also to get seedlings and other necessary items <#/>So anyway in short I wanted just the first part to expose this the nature uh of the problem itself <#/>So coming to the sec
o
nd part is that cooperatives and this I will be just brief the history of cooperatives peasant cooperatives in Tanzania begins uh from the nineteen nineteen-twenties and it begins through the initiative there of the <-/>the <-/>the farmers themselves the 
p
easants particularly the peasants who were involved in the production of export crops and this is partly as a struggle against the middlemen traders <#/>The peasants <./>com perceived that the middlemen traders were responsible for giving them very low uh
 
prices for their crops and therefore they were exploiting them so consequently uh peasants began to organise themselves so that they could take over the marketing of their crops <#/>So peasant associations began to be formed so that by nineteen twenty-fou
r
 you had the <./>Ba <-/>the uh uh <-/>the Bukoba Bahara Union nineteen twenty-five you had the Kilimanjaro Native Planters Association uh later on you had the <name/> Association Iringa you had the Meru Growers Association uh and uh in Mwanza you had also
 
Cotton Growers Association <#/>These were organised by the peasants themselves independent of the government <#/>So that was the beginning <#/>So this was the first stage in the development of cooperatives <#/>So when the British colonial government saw t
h
at development uh it found that it was not easy uh to abolish this uh mushrooming of peasant associations and uh given the fact that at the same period the British had also this policy of establishing peasant cooperatives in other colonies <#/>So they fou
n
d it's <-/>it's better to controls to control the associations peasant association instead of leaving them independent and autonomous <#/>That was a threat to the whole uh colonial system uh particularly the economic system and therefore in nineteen thirt
y
-two uh the British government decided to enact a law uh the Cooperative Societies Ordinance of nineteen thirty-two which made sure that all peasant associations had to be registered as cooperative uh organisations under that law <#/>But then the process 
o
f registering uh was not complete <#/>That's why you still had some other independent associations being formed up to around nineteen fifty-two <#/>So between nineteen thirty-two and nineteen fifty-two only two uh peasant cooperative associations were <-/
>
were registered as cooperatives and that was uh the Kilimanjaro Native uh Cooperative Union uh which was The <-/>the Kilimanjaro Native Planters Association was now registered and changed its name into the Kilimanjaro Native Cooperative Union nineteen thi
r
ty-three and nineteen thirty-six uh the <O/> Cooperative Union uh uh which was also registered under this <#/>So up to nineteen fifty-two these were the two <#/>Otherwise others were still independent and autonomous peasant associations <#/>So by nineteen
 
fifty-two the government made sure that all these associations uh had to be registered as peasant cooperatives and uh this time coincided with also the nationalist movement which also encouraged the formation of more peasant cooperatives uh because they v
ery much supported the nationalist movement and therefore you had a rapid expansion of peasant cooperatives between nineteen fifty-two and nineteen sixty-one to the time of independence <X_>}{\v 
So but then uh what it was the conception or perception of British colo
nialism uh on the peasant cooperatives The peasants themselves their perception was that they had to use these cooperatives uh to liberate themselves from the exploitation uh by private traders and also to use these cooperatives to uh facilitate the impro
v
ement there of their production of their crops But then the British of course had also that perception of improving uh the <-/>the <-/>the production of peasant crops uh but particularly improving the export crops and particularly given during this time t
h
e nineteen fifties uh when you had condemnance of uh this <-/>this <-/>this modernisation fury uh and therefore improving peasant and cultural production in terms of export crops was very much emphasised and particularly given uh the fact that after the <
-
_>after the<-/> Second World War the British had to use her colonies to <-/>to revive <./>ec <./>ec economy in Britain So that was the perception of uh of the British as far as the peasant cooperatives were concerned and that therefore it was necessary to
 
subordinate them uh to <-/>to <-/>to this <-_>to this<-/> law Now after independence there wasn't much change In fact the the fury of modernisation continued to play the significant role through the advice of the World Bank uh The World Bank report of nin
e
teen sixty-one was very <./>in instrumental making sure uh that at least the nature of uh agriculture particularly peasant agriculture uh continued to be on the pattern uh of the nineteen fifties and precisely more production of export crops and they deci
d
ed also the use of peasant cooperatives and therefore the result was that between nineteen sixty-one and nineteen sixty-seven uh you had a double in the number of cooperatives and particularly given the fact that since the cooperatives like trade unions p
l
ayed a very significant role politically during the struggle for independence to support TANU to achieve independence So they were also perceived after independence as also important instrument uh to consolidate the <./>po position uh of <-/>of <-/>of the
 
ruling party and the new nationalist government uh among the peasants in the rural areas So that uh nineteen sixty-two a regulation an amendment of the cooperative societies was made whereby cooperative societies could be established even in areas where t
h
ere were no crops for sale So every district had to have a cooperative union uh so whether it was viable or not viable So that uh uh the number of cooperatives expanded very very uh <O/> between nineteen sixty-one and nineteen sixty-seven So the new phase
 
of the in the development of cooperatives after independence begins with the Arusha Declaration Now the <-/>the <-/>the state begins to perceive cooperatives not only in terms of improving the agricultural production facilitating agricultural production W
e
 can also the nineteen sixties actually one of the steps which were taken by the uh <-/>the new government was to <./>os use cooperatives not only for marketing but also as institutions that could facilitate uh the <-/>the provision of credit facilities u
h
 to the <-_>to the<-/> <-_>to the<-/> peasants particularly those involved in the production of uh <-/>of cash crops So that's why the <-/>the Cooperative Bank established uh you had uh so many other institutions uh which were necessary to facilitate the 
u
h <-/>the credits the <-/>the provision of credits uh <-/>credits to <-/>to the peasants although uh not very much succeed Eventually uh the credit system collapsed So the new phase after nineteen sixty-seven the perception is to use cooperatives as insti
tutions to facilitate socialist transformation of agriculture uh in the rural areas and in fact one of the I\rquote 
ve quoted here a statement by the late President Nyerere when he was addretting addressing the Cooperative Union of Tanganyika which is an APEX orga
nisation in nineteen seventy-one He said that the policy of TANU for cooperative movement was transformed during <ea/>Ujamaa into production based multi-purpose cooperative societies and encouraged the spirit of cooperation among peasant farmers uh among 
p
easant uh <./>pea <./>pea <-/>peasant farmers The party saw the need to change the setup of primary societies because their members did not cooperate fully They only cooperated as far as marketing of their produce was concerned but how to produce then uh 
u
h <-_>how to produce then<-/> came about what was <-/>was <-/>was <-/>was every <O/>'s own business So this is uh the new perception that now they have to be uh play the role of producer cooperatives in the <ea/>Ujamaa <O/> but then besides various statem
e
nts the prime minister and other ministers made a lot of statements but then there wasn't a clear uh policy statement as to how these cooperatives are going to function as producer cooperatives uh in the <ea/>Ujamaa village so that it was until nineteen s
e
venty-five uh when the <ea/>Ujamaa and the <ea/>Ujamaa <O/>Act uh uh <ea/>Ujamaa and <ea/>Ujamaa Village Cooperative Societies Act was passed uh which to greater degree recognised <O/> to be the role uh of these cooperatives but then that role was namely 
t
o be the role of primary societies because the <-/>the cooperative structure in Tanzania has been such that you have primary societies in the village level and it's a number of primary societies come under a cooperative union which can be at district leve
l
 or regional level and then at the top you have the cooperative union of Tanganyika the APEX organisation So that is the structure but then the <-/>the <-/>the <-/>the <-/>the <-/>the level which had played this role socialist transformation was at the le
v
el of primary societies and according to this act of nineteen seventy-five so every village had to be registered as a primary society and every man <./>ab above the <-/>the year of <./>eight the age of eighteen had to be automatically a member of that pri
m
ary society There was no Now the question of <-/>of being free to choose to become a member of the society or not to become and there and then the societies now as cooperatives they had no longer that freedom which they had in the past of electing their o
w
n leaders the chairman of the society and the council because it was now the village chairman who was also chairman of that primary society but that village chairman or the party chairman and also head of the village government So that what you see at thi
s
 stage is the total subordination in the control of cooperative organisation so that after this uh <-/>this law the cooperative unions were not sure of their position so that's why by nineteen <./>seven in fact they had begun questioning this even before 
uh that period so that\rquote 
s why by nineteen seventy-six the government found that uh the cooperative unions had to be abolished So you had now the abolition of cooperative unions in nineteen seventy-six So what you had now is cooperative societies and then abo
ve them instead of cooperative unions uh <./>rel relating with cooperative societies in the marketing for crops now you have cooperative societies which are also very strong subordinate to the government uh related now to crop authorities which were now p
a
rastatal organisations not no longer peasant uh organisations So that was now the structure which had to <-/>to <-/>to operate so that situation continued So instead of solving the problems of cooperatives this structure having made the problems even wors
e
 So the crop <./>auth authorities cooperative unions even if you had the development of corruption at least uh they had an interest on the peasants uh in the sense that because they were uh <-_>they were<-/> uh <-_>they were<-/> the <-/>the institutions w
h
ich came about as a result of the peasants themselves because they were peasant organisations but now crop authorities were not So their interest was just to buy crops uh so the peasants in fact uh one of the factors if you observe very clearly which was 
a
 certain reason for the decline of field production in the <-_>in the<-/> <-/>the seventies was the resistance of peasants against crop authorities So that the crisis continued to the extent that the government had to decide to bring back cooperative unio
n
s in nineteen eighty-two That's why you have the law the new cooperative societies Act So cooperative unions had to come back uh as I said they had now to start at a very weak uh uh uh uh capital base uh Most of them started being formed nineteen eighty-f
o
ur By nineteen eighty-nine ninety you had a very big crisis of the cooperative some of them failing to market the peasant crops uh and uh so on and so forth So this is uh that is the situation So that uh the question now if now I can move now to our third
 part uh given this historical background given the existing <./>pre present problem what should be the future of these cooperatives So uh I start by saying that uh I open this the discussion }{\b\v <&/>laughter}{\v 
 I open this to the discussion but uh while opening t
his to the discussion uh let me make uh two main observations One is what's the conception of the peasants themselves now concerning cooperative organisations such I mean uh as you have confusion in terms at the level of policy uh the peasants themselves 
a
re not also very clear but certainly they still perceive the cooperatives as their organisations but there is also uh they are also very bitter about the problems which the cooperatives are facing particularly at the level of the unions the corruption uh 
the selling of <O/> and <O/> means uh the cooperative <-_>the cooperative<-/> can <-/>can borrow money from the bank uh and <-/>and <-/>and pretend to buy crops which do not exist so that the money is <O/> }{\b\v <&/>laughs}{\v 
 So uh despite these problems the peasant
s see the cooperatives if they were transformed uh if <-/>if <-/>if <-/>if <-/>if <-/>if the cooperatives would be transformed uh into better cooperatives if they could play a better function eradicating corruption and being committed to the peasants as t
h
eir organisations certainly the peasants would prefer cooperatives also to continue This is uh perception rough perception of the peasants and then uh the second observation is the nature and the character of the Tanzanian peasantry given the present situ
a
tion So the Tanzanian peasantry uh is at a situation whereby peasant agriculture uh basically is still stagnant uh as <./>mo most of our discussions and presentations here as we have seen uh with some few exceptions in some few regions at least where peas
a
nts have made a step in <-/>in <-/>in <-/>in <-/>in <-/>in getting into modern type of agricultural production uh at least enabling them to earn a reasonable income but the majority of Tanzanian peasants are still poor using primitive methods of productio
n
 uh and uh in the end <-/>end <-/>end as <-/>as <-/>as we have heard from quite a number of parts the structure adjustment organisation achieves So this is another observation we have made Now given these two observations uh really my view is that coopera
t
ives are still needed but they are needed only under conditions that they are greatly transformed and this transformation has to be at <-/>at <-/>at two levels first at the political level There is need for a serious democratisation of the cooperative org
a
nisations that they have to be controlled by the peasants themselves and that they have to be autonomised enough and that they have to have committed into serious leadership to ensure that they serve the peasants so that is at the political level and at t
h
e economic level they have to be economically strengthened their <-/>their their capital base financial base and all that have to be strengthened so that they can really serve the peasants And even their orientation instead of being pure marketing coopera
t
ives I think they can play much more a much more serious role in facilitating the transformation of peasant agriculture uh from this stagnant primitive stage uh into a modern type uh of agricultural production So that these are the two conditions which ar
e
 needed uh but then even even then of course uh in that form that the cooperatives can be in the position to compete now with the private traders to avoid the suffering which the peasants have begun so whereby where <-/>where a private trader cannot uh do
 the marketing uh at least the cooperative should be there and therefore the process can continue Thank you }{</X></I>

m <-/>I'm the only person in a way in this room a bureaucrat who is <slang/>gonna try to act the academic so I thought I'd say something just from that perspective uh and I'll do that by looking at the <-/>the changing <O/> of state o
f agro-pastoralism and the agro-pastoralism I\rquote 
m referring to is this term in which agriculture and livestock keeping have almost an equal uh social economic and uh political value to the people that practise it as opposed to mixed farming where there could
 be livestock and <./>re real farming and uh as has been presented already in previous presentations changes in Tanzania since independence uh have been tremendous <#/>We had over ninety per cent of our population living in the rural areas <#/>Now we are 
told it\rquote 
s less about eighty per cent so with a growing urbanisation uh the population that is living in the rural areas is getting smaller but it is still predominant and quite significant and uh at independence agro-pastoralism was limited to a number of p
laces like Karange Mwanza Shinyanga <O/> Iminara region among the <name/> and then among the <name/> then we had only a number of <O/> and then the Turu and all these places we have agro-pastoralists but then we have the pastoral peoples according to rese
a
rches in the sixties by colleague <name/> and that is among the Barbaig <-_>the Barbaig<-/> who are groups who are still pastoral <#/>You have the Massai <#/>They are pastoral <#/>Of course the Arusha agro-pastoral around Mount <-/>Mount Meru so you have 
<
./>agro-pastoral agro-pastoralists in certain areas pastoralism in others and cultivators shifting cultivators in other areas and when you look at the tribal the so-called tribal map drawn in the late fifties it could show you where the Sukuma are living 
w
here the Haya are living where the Massai are living all over the country and you could be told they are <O/> they are <O/> et cetera et cetera so you had a landscape which was very clearly limited in terms of geographic collocations of these people so th
i
s production system in Tanzania three decades ago was limited to particular areas which were known and in other places like southern Tanzania the biggest in <name/> was the goat <#/>They've never seen cattle and some of them saw cattle for the first time 
in the <-_>in the<-/> seventies through government policy and actually they were afraid of milking these animals <#/>Now uh what we have now in the three decades is the expansion of <./>agro <-/>agro agro-pastoralism <#/>That\rquote s why I\rquote 
m talking of a changing
 landscape in the sense that agro-pastoralism the map we have now is different from the map we had at independence of this production system <#/>The agro-pastoralism has now burst its borders in terms of the Sukuma who were known to be in Mwanza and Shiny
a
nga <#/>They have systematically moved through the <name/> area into some <name/> plains and into the <-/>into Morogoro region where they are keeping herds of cattle and practising <O/> <#/>We have the <-/>the <-_>We have the <-/>the<-/> Arusha people who
 have moved into a mostly entire Massai land where they are practising cultivation in the higher potential areas like we were told the mountain areas or the highland areas where you have <-_>you have<-/> <O_>}{\b\v\lang2057 two or three words}{\lang2057 
<O/> <#/>These have been occupi
ed or colonalized by agro-pastoral Arusha in Massai land but they practise agriculture <#/>So on the one hand we have the migration and expansion of agro-pastoralism where it has <-_>it has<_/> been moving physically by people of those communities which w
e
re located particularly as in the past moving out with their herds and with their agriculture into new areas so we have some plains which have been occupied now by the Sukuma <#/>We have the Mwanzi moving to those areas and in <-/>in Morogoro area where w
e
 have quite a substantial amount of people from those <-/>those places <#/>So this is one phenomenon <#/>The other one is where you have pastoralism emerging in former pastoral areas agricultural development and uh pastoral communities have been known of 
c
ourse to consume agricultural goods for a long time <#/>People travelled through Massai land in the <-_>in the<-/> eighteen-eighties <#/>We are saying that the Massai were exchanging their <-/>their pastoral products for agricultural goods <#/>Even during
 war they will <-_>they will<-/> send their women to collect agro-pastoral goods <#/>So it\rquote 
s not a phenomenon that is new depending on some of agricultural produce but they never produced these crops themselves <#/>They bartered again with other communities
 and other people and literature on the <name/> or in literature sometimes they are called <name/> they were cultivating and after the wars of the Massai in the eighteenth century they were looked down }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_on>}{\v\lang2057  }{\lang2057 
as people practising agriculture by the other M
assai because these were infiltrating <#/>These are keeping livestock and nothing else and these others are doing some cultivation and uh so you have this division <-/>division now there is a trend to move <O/> agriculture in the pastoral areas not depend
i
ng on the food <O/> but being able to grow them themselves <#/>So what I am studying here is not the well-known fact that agriculture has been transported into pastoral areas by land-hungry cultivators agro-pastoralists and commercial farmers and the stat
e
 projects <#/>I am looking into process in which hitherto pastoral communities have or are gradually taking up agriculture for their purpose of dealing with their different needs <#/>The reasons are new <#/>One Mr Chairman is that productivity of their pa
s
toral system has declined in many parts of Tanzania for many reasons <#/>One is the scarcity of land <#/>If the high potential areas have been taken over by the cultivators then the system is ready to sustain itself so there are returns on <-/>on labour a
l
one <#/>Again there has been the decline of livestock for many reasons <#/>One is of course the shifting of pastures but another is that through government switching from being a provider to a facilitator in the past all the dips and all the <./>livest ag
r
icultural no no the animal health facilities were given for free and suddenly during the crisis the government is unable to provide these services so suddenly the services are not available and then there have been so many debts from this switch from prov
i
ding to facilitating <#/>People are required now to buy sites and borrow other services <#/>Some can some cannot and those who can they <-/>they avoid it <#/>They have been used to getting it for free <#/>They are not yet doing that <#/>So people lost liv
e
stock and this process we have uh documented that information <#/>We find that people gradually are becoming more dependent on agricultural foods <#/>Whereas in the sixties the people from Ngorongo were dependent on agricultural foods for only twenty per 
c
ent of their food intake uh in <./>mid-eight <-/>in mid-eighties they were dependent on agricultural foods for fifty-three per cent of their food intake so they need nutritional value <#/>The way they can combine their foods has been getting you know poor
e
r and poorer uh but another thing is that in the seventies Mr Chairman one head of cattle could purchase could be <O/> for eight bags of maize but today you uh one <-/>one bag of three bags of maize can <-/>can be bought by a head of cattle one big head o
f
 cattle so the terms of trade have been working against pastoralism against animal production so whereas they could barter more they could barter for more bags of maize or other forms of grain by less heads of cattle they are paying less for more heads of
 cattle to barter and get maize so there\rquote 
s been some economic motivation that if you can grow the food yourself then you save your <-/>your herd from deflation but on the other hand is there is this <-/>this feeling that uh for <-/>for decades the people ha
ve been bombarded by the ideological bullets of the nation state <#/>Of course we bureaucrats have been going around telling people you must become <./>agricult agriculturalists you must grow food crops you must grow cash crops and this over a few decades
 
seems to be catching up with the pastoralists and uh in uh all this the Barbaig who were pastoral a few decades ago they are now agro-pastoral <#/>You have other people <#/>The Massai themselves now are becoming pastoral <#/>So the trend is moving on <#/>
T
here are those people who are not cattlemen for example but they have taken to agriculture for the cash for a different motive <#/>Rather than deflate your <O/> for food you grow that food but then by selling the surplus which you may have acquired from <
-
/>from the produce you can buy more <O/> of cattle and do more things with in this way <#/>So there are people who are <-_>who are<-/> pastoral <-_>who are pastoral<-/> but now aren't pastoral not because they are <-_>they are<-/> losing cattle or they ar
e
 unable to feed themselves sufficiently but because there is this amount <#/>So the ideology of the state has been catching up with these people but what does this mean in terms of pastoralism in this new trend <#/>It means all the high potential areas th
a
t were vital for agro-pastoral for pastoralism because you needed the territory where you can get water salt lakes you can have pastures you can <-_>you can<-/> uh all the other things that you need but now the high potential areas are being taken over by
 individuals from the <O/> because in this system everything that has been put under agriculture becomes kind of <O/> individualized by the individual cultivator but <O}{\b\lang2057 _>}{\b\v\lang2057 two or three words}{\lang2057 <O/> place as long as it
\rquote s out there people will be will have access 
to it <#/>It belongs to them all <#/>But once you <O/> you <-/>you take it over and there is this process now that the high potential areas are being taken over now by the outsiders cultivators agro-pastoralists but also pastoralists themselves the Massai
 
are having cultivation so they are also transforming their own resources in that pattern that which <-/>which used to transform and contain these processes uh <#/>To go quickly through these things what <-/>what I what we have now is you have agro-pastora
l
ism in the former pastoral areas <#/>You have agro-pastoralists moving on their way into the new areas so this landscape having changed what is <-/>what is what does it mean what are the implications <#/>More so in terms of policy <#/>More so in terms of 
h
istory-making <#/>When we were studying an area say Massai land you are looking at the problems of that particular area sometimes an exclusion of all the other problems around <#/>When we are dealing with pastoralism you are looking at the pastoralists th

Already in some areas local people are raising concern over the way in which migrant agr

m saying now this opportunity has moved in this area to what extent can it be a potential for changing development The increasing dependence on agriculture and the subsequent tak

ewood has increased significantly There are studies to verify this in <name/> and other parts that more time more labour time is spent on firewood and on cooking than <they used to spend before on pastoral foods The tree cover near pastoral settlements ha

of influence <#/>In both cases some views are read others are not <#/>Some views are heard others are not <#/>That is what the process of selection is about and that is where the influence flows <#/>In these circumstances what I am calling upon the media 
t

s
s issues and not personalities <#/>On the record so far it seems to me there has been a visible tendency for contributors to go for the person rather than the argument for abuse rather than ratiocination <#/>It is important to remember that we are not emb
a
rked upon a public contestation of patriotism <#/>We should be engaged rather in a comprehensive reasoned analysis of the political economic social and constitutional circumstances now obtaining in our country the problems they give rise to and the kinds

 the official media <#/>The official media's editorial comments tend to be seen by the average person to reflect official view in every respect and on every occasion <#/>Now you and I know that that cannot be the case <#/>The M

q
uite ambitious development programmes <#/>Right after independence we started to chart out long-term development strategies <#/>First we had three-year development programmes followed by five-year development programmes <#/>In all these programmes transpo
r
t and particularly road development featured very highly <#/>Several new roads were built to a bitumen standard <#/>These included the Tanzam highway nine hundred and fifty kilometres and the Chalinze - Segera and the Mkumbara - Kisangiro roads three hund
r
ed kilometres Mtwara - Masasi two hundred kilometres which were built between nineteen sixty-eight and nineteen seventy-five <#/>Thousands of kilometres of gravel roads were also constructed <#/>Throughout these plans our emphasis was on development which
 
was synonymous with new construction <#/>Little attention was given to preservation and maintenance of the transport infrastructure <#/>Efforts by the government to try and address the problem of road maintenance started in the late nineteen seventies wit
h trunk road maintenance projects which were supported by the World Bank <#/>These however turned out to be half measures and did not succeed to arrest }{\b\v\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\lang2057 
 the fast deterioration of the road network <#/>Your Excellencies and distinguished guests by 
the mid nineteen eighties it had become evident that the deterioration of the transport infrastructure was cause for alarm <#/>The manifestations can be summarised as follows
\par <#/>A The condition of most rural roads was poor and transport to villages restricted to dry seasons
\par <#/>B The trunk road network had deteriorated to such an extent that only about forty per cent of the trunk road network was in good condition severely increasing the cost of transport and curtailing the movement of goods
\par <#/>C The truc
king sub-sector which accounts for over seventy per cent of agricultural produce haulage from rural areas had been allowed to deteriorate due to lack of foreign exchange to replace the aged fleet as well as to maintain the fleet in <./>rutti <-/>in runnin
g condition with spare parts and tyres 
\par <#/>E Inadequate trucking capacity coupled with low operational efficiency of }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\lang2057  parastatal trucking fleet had prevented the trucking sub-sector from coping with the surge in agricultural production following
 implementation of the Economic Recovery Programme
\par <#/>F The two railways which are strategically located to carry}{\b\lang2057  }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\lang2057  majority of long distance domestic and transit traffic were able to carry home only fifteen per cent of the total goods movement 
in the country and 
\par <#/>H Due to deteriorated berth and equipment the ports were unable to adequately accommodate the import and export traffic of the country nor compete effectively against other regional ports for transit traffic of neighbouring land-loc
ked countries <#/>As a consequence of this pathetic state of the transportation infrastructure and the resultant unsatisfactory operational efficiency progress on the government's Economic Recovery Programme was stalled <#/>It was against this background 
t
hat the government convened the transport sector donors' conference in December nineteen eighty-seven here in Arusha <#/>At that conference documents entitled Programme for Transport Sector Recovery outlined the basic policy institutional changes and reha
bilitation requirements of the economy <#/>Also a draft national transport policy was presented to the donors <#/>Your Excellencies and distinguished guests the nineteen eighty-seven Arusha strategy for the transport sector entailed the following
\par <#/>A Systematic efforts to be made to improve the operational efficiency of the sector
\par <#/>B Financial performance and cost recovery to be improved throughout the transport sector
\par <#/>C Increasing resource allocation to the transport sector particularly for roads
\par <#/>D Improving the utilisation of existing asserts through improving the management and operations
\par <#/>E Concentrating future efforts on rehabilitation and maintenance of the basic road network
\par <#/>F Adjusting institutional structures consistent with effectively carrying out the required rehabilitation maintenance and operations
\par <#/>G Top priority to be given to maintenance funds' allocation for roads which had fallen far short of requirement in the past and
\par <#/>H To secure the maximum possible foreign exchange allocation for road maintenance as well for current operational requirements of trucking railways and aviation sub-sectors
\par <#/>Looking at the individual sectors and sub-sectors <#/>The railway subsector <#/>At a separate donors' conference in February
 nineteen eighty-seven the government and TRC adopted the Emergency Recovery Programme aimed at rehabilitating and strengthening the operations and management system for Tanzania Railways Corporation <#/>Under the programme it was agreed to concentrate al
l
 investments in the rehabilitation of key assets and to improve operating capacity through managerial improvements under a ten point programme TAZARA since nineteen eighty-four has been implementing a ten-year development plan with donor support for twent
y
-three project items to bring up its operations near to the effective installed capacity <#/>The port subsector <#/>Your Excellencies and distinguished guests the strategy for the port subsector was to continue with the modernisation of the Port of Dar es
 
Salaam which had started in nineteen eighty-five and included the rehabilitation of the berths and cargo handling equipment coupled with training and technical assistance to improve efficiency in cargo handling for both container and general cargo <#/>As 
for the <./>avie aviation subsector the government economic recovery strategy in the civil aviation sub-sector included measures intended to improve the condition in the <./>subjec in the subsector as follows
\par <#/>A Carrying out a study to rationalise Air Tanzania Corporation's overhead and support structure to improve its productivity including possible need of technical assistance
\par <#/>B Formulating a staged programme to increase fares for domestic market to ensure full cost recovery in the provision of services by ATC and introduce a more flexible mechanism to enable fair adjustment on a timely basis
\par <#/>C Limiting capital investment by ATC until such time as a rational development and financial strategy could be developed
\par <#/>D Pursuing an open-sky policy allowing local charter airlines to provide domestic scheduled services to meet the demand for air transport
\par <#/>E To improve and rehabilitate aerodromes within the framework of recommendations of a development study to be undertaken
\par <#/>The road transport s
ubsector <#/>Your Excellencies and distinguished guests the strategy for the trucking subsector focused on the importation of requirements including an accelerated replacement programme for aged trucks and continued support for importing spare parts fuel 
and raw materials for tyre production to alleviate rural transport and }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\lang2057 
 marketing of agricultural commodities In the short term the government agreed to allow market forces to determine the appropriate level of interregional trucking tariffs with
 a view to allowing the operators to recover their operating costs and to realise a reasonable return on their assets <#/>And in the long term to review the role and function of RETCOs and other state-owned transport agencies <#/>The roads' subsector <#/>
The roads' subsector strategy comprises a comprehensive approach which entailed integrating the implementation of key road investments with major policy and institutional reforms such as
\par A Rehabilitating and improving the priority trunk and rural roads essential for evacuation of agricultural products
\par B Strengthening the administration and management of trunk and regional roads in order to maintain the rehabilitated roads network in satisfactory condition
\par C Enhancing road maintenance capacity in the country through promotion and use of local contractors
\par D Improving the availability of road maintenance equipment through encouraging the establishment of commercially operated plant pools
\par E Improving resource mobilisation and allocation in order to provide for adequate maintenance of truck and regional road networks and 
\par F Re-orienting public expenditure to increase the overall size of the road budget and to allocate adequate funds for road maintenance and rehabilitation 
\par <#/>Achievements of the strategies under t
he programme for transport sector recovery <#/>Your Excellencies and distinguished guests I'm glad to report that since nineteen eighty-seven the government has taken a number of key policy and institutional actions that are needed to attain the physical 
targets spelt out in the transport sector recovery strategy <#/>In particular in the railway subsector under a memorandum of understanding between TRC and the Government TRC has been allowed to operate on }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\lang2057 
 commercial basis thereby setting salaries and taking other decisions without reference to government <#/>It is heartening to note that since }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\lang2057 
 fiscal year nineteen ninety-one TRC has been making an operating profit <#/>With regard to the port subsector in order to recover the investmen
t under the port modernisation project and to cope with the fall in the value of the shilling the government has allowed THA to increase tariffs which had not been changed since nineteen eighty-four <#/>Furthermore measures to commercialise THA are under 
w
ay and towards this end the Dar es Salaam port development master plan study and the <./>commer <-/>the commercialisation study are planned <#/>Turning to the aviation subsector in March nineteen ninety-two the government made several important and bold d
ecisions on the future of ATC as follows
\par <#/>One ATC shall continue to exist but shall operate on a commercial basis generating a profit
\par <#/>Two Government will absorb a large part of AT's debt in order to make corporations' balance sheet attractive to private investors
\par <#/>Three Allowing ATC to sell some of its <./>ass assets generating funds to pay off creditors and to improve its working capital position
\par <#/>And Four Giving ATC the autonomy to <./>to set tariffs and the mandate to gradually withdraw its s
ervices from the loss-making roots <#/>The civil aviation board has implemented the open-sky policy by granting operating licences to other operators to compete with ATC <#/>And government has commissioned a study to look into the restructuring of the dir
e
ctorate of civil aviation and the creation of a national airports authority to manage operate and maintain the major airports <#/>However government will continue to provide for the uneconomical airports especially in the remote areas <#/>With regard to t
h
e road transport subsector the availability of vehicles transport inputs and spares has been greatly enhanced through the liberalisation of imports of vehicles and spare parts using own or the open general licence funds as well as direct support by donors
 
and grants from friendly countries <#/>And the government has endeavoured to improve passenger and goods transport operations in rural areas by exempting all vehicles of carrying capacity of over three tons and buses of twenty-five passengers capacity fro
m
 import duty and sales tax <#/>Furthermore the government has allowed UDA and the private operators to earn a reasonable return on their investments <#/>Turning to the road sub-sector investment priorities have been re-oriented to road rehabilitation and 
m
aintenance <#/>Furthermore and this is very important the budget re-allocations for road maintenance are being increased annually <#/>For instance government funds for annual routine and periodic road maintenance have increased by two hundred and fifty pe
r
 cent from about <./>U United States dollars four point nine million in fiscal year nineteen eighty-seven eighty-eight to US dollars seventeen million in fiscal year nineteen ninety-two ninety-three <#/>Since nineteen ninety-one ninety-two fiscal year rev
enue for road maintenance is being collected mainly from road users through the imposition of a levy on fuel consumption which is deposited into a designated roads' fund <#/>In }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\lang2057 
 Ministry of Works the institutional framework for planning managing and maintaining the roads networks has been restructured through the following measures
\par <#/>One The creation of the division for roads and aerodromes
\par <#/>Two The decentralisation of authority for implementing road maintenance and works to the twenty regional engineers offices
\par <#/>Three Under IRP various donors are funding technical assistance teams in eleven regions to strengthen the execution capacity for maintaining the roads by the Regional Engineers' offices
\par <#/>Four Under the IRP umbrella donors are su
pporting well-defined programmes at the University of Dar es Salaam Engineering Faculty Technical Colleges of Dar es Salaam and Arusha Ministry of Works' Training Institute at Morogoro and at the National Institute of Transport 
\par <#/>}{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\lang2057  Execution c
apacity for maintaining the road network is being improved through the REO's by gradually increasing the contracting out of road maintenance works <#/>Also under UNDP ILO support a programme to train local contractors in rural road rehabilitation and main
t
enance using labour-based methods started in Kilimanjaro region in nineteen ninety-two and the programme will be extended to other regions soon <#/>And Ministry of Works roads building equipment has been transferred to a plant and equipment hire company w
h
ich started hiring to REO's and contractors at commercial rates with effect from July nineteen ninety-two <#/>What has been the impact of the programme for the transport sector recovery <#/>Your Excellencies and distinguished guests much progress has been
 made in the last six years of the implementation of the programme for the transport sector recovery <#/>}{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\v\lang2057  }{\lang2057 
Assessment of the impact of the programme on the economy shows that mobility has increased dramatically where road conditions have improved 
and that crops cereals and fresh fruits and vegetables are now moving more easily from the farms to the processing and storage centres and to the markets <#/>In specific terms the impact can be said to be as follows <#/>Within the railways the haulage of 
t
ransit traffic which earns foreign exchange for the country has improved more than a hundred per cent since fiscal year nineteen ninety-one <#/>Also there are significant improvements on the movement of export commodities such as coffee <#/>With regard to
 
the ports the average ship stay time in port has gone down to three days as opposed to eight days before the implementation of the port modernisation project <#/>The overall productivity of the port has improved appreciably <#/>The average gang output for
 general cargo is now two hundred and fifty tons per shift compared to about a hundred tons in the mid nineteen eighties <#/>The average container dwell time has reduced }{\b\v\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\lang2057 
 from about fifty days to an average of only about thirteen days <#/>In a nut
shell the improved productivity of the port which led to savings in transit costs has made the Dar es Salaam port much more competitive with other regional ports <#/>With regard to the roads and road transports improved road conditions have led to shorter
 
travel times <#/>This has been most significant along the Tanzam highway between Dar es Salaam and Zambia and along the Northern route to Kenya through Chalinze Segera Moshi and Arusha including the branch to Tanga <#/>In fact the travel time between Dar 
e
s Salaam and Arusha six hundred and fifty kilometres is now less than nine hours compared to fourteen hours before implementation of the IRP <#/>Additionally buses are now travelling regularly to many regional and district centres which were isolated befo
r
e road works and maintenance started under IRP <#/>Also traffic volumes have generally doubled on those forecast in the feasibility studies for sections that have undergone rehabilitation under IRP which shows the impact of good roads on personal mobility
 and freight movement <X_>}{\v\lang2057 
Regional Road Rehabilitation has increased economic activity in the areas of influence There is timely movement of agricultural inputs and the produce and the movement of cereals and food <./>fr from production to deficit areas and to 
the main markets is very much easier Your Excellencies and distinguished guests the achievements we have been able to recall are to a large extent due to the great support we have received from the donor community General support for IRP was received from
 
sixteen donor agencies under the co-ordination of the World Bank These include the IDA DAINIDA the Governments of Germany and Italy FINIDA ODA UNDP NORAD the Government of the Netherlands USAID EEC the Governments of Switzerland and Ireland the African De
v
elopment Bank the African Development Fund the Saudi Fund and the Government of Japan On behalf of the Government and the people of the United Republic of Tanzania and on my own behalf I wish to take this grand occasion to express our again our sincere th

 and I request your Excellencies here present to convey these sentiments to your governments and peoples who have shown real concern and understanding of Tanzania's development n
eeds general and the IRP in particular You have indeed been friends in need Turning now to the IRP Second Phase Your Excellencies distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen having elaborated on the progress and success of the programme for transport sector
 
recovery I wish now to turn to the main issue of our gathering here today the second phase of the integrated roads project The focus of IRP Two will be to continue the momentum to achieve the policy institutional reform and physical targets that had been 
a
greed at the nineteen eighty-seven Arusha Conference Details of the components of the Second Phase of IRP will be presented to you in the next two days by senior officers of the two ministries However permit me to mention the highlights of IRP Two compone
nts as follows
\par A Restructuring of the Ministry of Communications and Transport The restructuring of the Ministry of Communications and Transport will provide additional impetus in improving overall administration of the transport sector as well as in the re
gulatory co-ordination and monitoring role of the Ministry The main focus will be two-fold One complete to complete the process of separating model operations from the functions of the parent ministry and two to assist parastatals in becoming financially 
s
elf-sufficient and commercially more productive through where appropriate associations with private firms The specific components include technical assistance and training to improve overall transport sector planning policy formulation budgeting and perfo
rmance <./>maint monitoring and }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\v\lang2057  provision of up-to-date office technology and equipment and training 
\par B Support for road transport services Under this component donors are requested to provide financing for }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\v\lang2057  procurement of vehicles an
d spare parts for rural and urban freight and passenger services NTC will procure the vehicles and spare parts on behalf of the Government and private dealerships will sell the items to both private and public sector operators I will read that again NTC w
i
ll procure the vehicles and spare parts on behalf of the Government and private dealerships will sell the items to both private and public sector operators As Your Excellencies and distinguished guests are aware NTC has successfully performed this role un
der bilateral programmes in the past several years To meet the requirements for vehicles and spare parts based on the demand and supply studies would require about United States dollars seventy-two million over a period of three years
\par C Rehabilitation and r
estructuring of civil aviation The main international airports at Dar es Salaam and Kilimanjaro particularly the latter suffer from inadequate safety equipment and navigational aids Donors are requested to finance the rehabilitation works as well as the a
c
quisition of safety and navigational aids accordingly Also under IRP Two the Government is committed to implementing recommendations of an action plan on policy regulatory and institutional reforms to improve competition in the provision of air transport 
services and to operate the major airports on a commercial basis 
\par D Village level travel and transport pilot programme Throughout Tanzania many villages are cut off during the rainy seasons and transport is undertaken predominantly by women head-loading The
refore in order to improve the accessibility of rural villages and to provide demonstrations of workable solutions to rural travel and transport problems through sustainable self-help schemes donors are requested to support a pilot project in one or more 
districts The project will be implemented on }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\v\lang2057 self-help basis and will include }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\v\lang2057  rehabilitation and maintenance of local rural roads and tracks }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{
\v\lang2057  use of intermediate means of transport and non-transport interventions aimed at }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\v\lang2057  reduction of }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\v\lang2057 
 effort and time spent on travel and transport by households Ten districts have been assessed for this pilot phase 
\par E Road network strategies The focus of IRP Two will be to sustain the momentum to achieve the road condition targets as well as to reinforce the process begun under IRP One to decentralise }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\v\lang2057 
 implementation of road rehabilitation and maintenance activities to regional level through appropriate organisational changes and through }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\v\lang2057  increased contracting out of works and services Specific components are

\par One Policy and institutional support consisting of management systems' development career development and training and }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\v\lang2057  development of the construction industry
\par Two Upgrading rehabilitation and periodic maintenance of road sections costing about US dollars six hundred million The works will include the following Rehabilitation of ab
out nine hundred and seventy kilometres upgrading to paved or double surface dressing standards of about six hundred and thirty kilometres and spot improvements on a further one thousand and fifty kilometres of trunk roads Rehabilitation of about one thou
s
and eight hundred and twenty kilometres of selected essential district roads and about one thousand one hundred and ninety kilometres of regional roads Carrying out backlog periodic maintenance on about four hundred and fifty kilometres of trunk roads and
 
about one thousand three hundred kilometres of regional roads and rehabilitation of bridges culverts and ferries on both the trunk and regional road networks Your Excellencies ladies and gentlemen as I said earlier the market progress achieved under IRP O
n
e is a result of the close co-operation between donors and the government not only in the provision of the required funds but also in the form of consultative group meetings sector donors' conferences subsectoral donors' co-ordination meetings and worksho
p
s Your continued co-operation and support will be even more crucial for successful implementation of the second phase of IRP Your Excellencies and distinguished guests the people of Tanzania are beginning to see and appreciate the need for good roads They
 are therefore ready to co-operate with the Government in safe-guarding these roads They are also ready to contribute to their maintenance through road user charges The government will endeavour to continue educating the public and other road users on }{
\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\v\lang2057 
 proper use of these roads so as to ensure sustainability of maintenance efforts Indeed it is my sincere belief that with the present level of government commitment the proposed restructuring of the administration of the transport sector in general a
nd the re-organisation of the road administration in particular the orderly behaviour of law-abiding road users and the support of the donor community the road transport sector in Tanzania will assume its rightful role of being the engine of our economic 
r
enaissance Your Excellencies distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen once again I thank you for your dedication and I wish you every success in your deliberations during these two days It's now my pleasure to declare this donors' conference for the seco
nd phase of the integrated roads project formally opened Thank you }{\lang2057 </X></I>

 Honourable Horace Kolimba to officiate }{\b\v <+_at> <&/>prep}{ the opening of our sixth Tanzanian Association of Parastatal Organisations Symposium }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
Honourable chief guest the audience in front of you are essentially the chief executives of parastatal organisations in Tanzania }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
TAPO was founded in nineteen eighty-one principally to promote co-ordinated efforts in managing our economy and to create a forum for improved communication and dialogue between the government and our parastatal organisations with an 
overall aim of promoting corporate excellency and effectiveness }{\lang2057 <#/>}{It has been customary for us to hold every year a symposium to review and exchange ideas on current issues which have particular bearing }{\b\v <&/>clearing his throat}{\v  
}{on the performance of our organisations }{\lang2057 <#/>}{The theme for this year\rquote s symposium is <-_on> }{\b\v <&/>prep}{ commercialization of parastatals in Tanzania }{\lang2057 <#/>}{Recent years have seen }{\b\v <+_article>}{
 increased interest not only <-_on><+_in> }{\b\v <&/>prep}{ the performance but also <-_on><+_in> }{\b\v <&/>prep}{ the
 justification of public enterprises in Tanzania in the wake of their discernible inability to assist in propping up our ailing economy and the recognition that they\rquote re in fact substantially accountable for the present ills of the economy }{
\lang2057 <#/>}{Our <./>symp symposium last year therefore focused on searching for various options and conceptual frameworks under which our troubled parastatal organisations could be restructured back into viable entities }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
Indeed we managed to cover valuable ground in respect of gaining a deeper insight <-_of><+_into> }{\b\v <&/>prep}{ the factors at the root of our problems their complexity and }{\b\v <+_article>}{ possible direction we ought to be moving }{\b\v <+_in>}{
\v  }{to redress uh these particular problems }{\b\v <+_article>}{\v  }{\lang2057 <#/>}{Inadequate play of market forc
es in the operational environment of parastatal organisations in Tanzania however stood out through and through as one of the more basic and major <-_constraint><+_constraints> affecting performance }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
Studies in countries grappling with a similar phenomenon have indicated that this is not a problem peculiar to Tanzania }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
It is a typical problem and certainly the leading factor which has retarded economic growth and even brought about turmoil among centrally planned economies dominated by state-run enterprises }{\lang2057 <#/>}{There is now a consensus that }{\b\v 
<+_article>}{ transformation into market friendly economies with a greater dictation of market driven forces in determining their location of resources and economic activity <-_many><+_much> more participation in the 
state in business and the increasing exposure to domestic and international competition hold the key to the infusion of innovation efficiency and improved productivity among public enterprises and their economies at large }{\lang2057 <#/>}{In this year
\rquote s symposium we have thus chosen to extend our last year\rquote 
s discussion on parastatal restructure by examining in greater focus the aspect of parastatal commercialization which is seen as an important vehicle towards comprehensive restructuring and one having }{\b\v <&/>lexeme}{ poten
tially rapid dividends in rehabilitating our parastatal organisations }{\lang2057 <#/>}{Honourable chief guests }{\b\v <+_article>}{ commercialization of parastatal organisations will characteristically entail }{\b\v <+_article>}{
 dismantling of all forms of government non-tariff protection or any preferential treatment or insulation of our parastatals against domestic and foreign competitors }{\lang2057 <#/>}{It will also call for }{\b\v <+_article>}{
 significant withdrawal of government interference in the management of parastatal organisations with parallel concessions on parastatal autonomy }{\lang2057 <#/>}{One is happy to note that we have made some modest beginning }{\b\v <&/>idiom}{
 in some of these matters albeit in patches and within a disjointed and ambivalent policy environment }{\lang2057 <#/>}{It is still a fact however that effective
 commercialization of a parastatal organisation is an important if not a necessary transient step before embarking into <./>comprehe comprehensive restructuring which has to deal with the complex and emotive issues of closure play-offs divestiture privati
zation and has in any case to move cautiously and in phases }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
Commercialization should also be able to facilitate attraction of joint-venture partners and private investors into rehabilitating our ailing parastatal organisations and even enhancing the value of their equity sale }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
In view of the urgency to get our economic enterprises to contribute to the growth and development of our country however we have to move away now from mere conceptualization of the problem at hand into developing and urgently a
 concrete action programme for commercializing and restructuring our parastatal organisations }{\lang2057 <#/>}{We need however to have an appropriate operating framework to guide us in doing this exercise successfully }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
A plausible framework in developing a sound action programme for restructuring public enterprises in Tanzania will have to reflect an evolutionary and a total systems approach process }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
Five systematic stages which I consider basic in this <./>pro process are problem identification fixing desired obj
ectives uh setting up implementation strategies identification and planning of tactics and finally diagnosis and action implementation requirements }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
The first stage towards developing a sound commercialization or restructuring packages for <./>im imbattled parastatal organisations is to identify the specific problems and factors behind poor performance for each respective organisation }{\lang2057 <#/>
}{This these factors will be sustained operating losses for instance or non-competitiveness in the domestic or international markets or excessive cost to the consumers etcetera etcetera }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
Once the problems are known it will be possible then to move to the second stage which involves pinpointing objectives of the intended remedial action }{\lang2057 <#/>}{Some of these objectives for r
estructuring will be efficiency competitiveness profitability <./>elib elimination of subsidies or disengagement from excessive bank borrowing uh dependence }{\lang2057 <#/>}{The third stage comprises <-_of> }{\v <&/>prep }{
evaluating and selecting appropriate strategies for achieving each parastatal organisation\rquote s major objective uh restructuring }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
The fourth stage focuses on developing specific tactics needed to carry the sale of shares that equity shops sell to local or foreign <./>investm investors etcetera }{\lang2057 <#/>}{The fifth 
and final stage in this process is consideration of the implementation requirements }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
Both comprehensive restructuring and prior to that commercialization of <-/>of parastatal organisations in Tanzania call into play important implementation implications
 which will have to be addressed effectively in the interest of drawing up a viable action programme }{\lang2057 <#/>}{Chief among these is the need to create a central organ preferably }{\b\v <+_article>}{
 parastatal reform commission to develop policy and to plan co-ordinate and supervise the implementation of parastatal commercialization and restructuring in Tanzania }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
The complexity of the exercise <-/>exercise imposes uh <O/> some organisational deman
ds and nothing short of a strong and independent body capable of looking at the <./>prob problem globally <./>comprehensive comprehensively and systematically in well-conceived phases can assure us success }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
The introduction of <-_an> appropriate and ade
quate financial intermediaries such as merchant banks stock exchange and capital markets which take time to set up and function will have to be carefully planned and made to move harmoniously with the programmed restructuring }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
There is also the question of ethnic balance in equity ownership which deserves due attention as well as how to promote indigenous entrepreneurs to participate fully in the uh privatised or semi-privatised uh enterprises }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
Further down there are issues of evolving appropriate legislation and defining areas for institutional and infrastructural building by the central government in order to create an enabling environment for corporate excellence }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
All these will require the co-ordination and direction of a <?/>PAFU central organ }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
The other critical implementation requirement in the process of commercialization and ultimate comprehensive restructuring of parastatal organisations in Tanzania is the backing of a strong political wing and }{\b\v <+_article>}{
 unambiguous commitment <-_over><+_to> }{\b\v <&/>prep}{ these measures <-_by><+_of> }{\b\v <&/>prep}{ the government and the party }{\lang2057 <#/>}{In all fairness these elements are presently in serious ><-_deficience><+_deficiency> }{\b\v <&/>idiom}{
 although there have been some <-/>some uh <./>dis discussions in the last few uh <-/>few days }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
An improvement in posture is extremely vital and for a start it could be reflected by the government and the party addressing more seriously the question of setting up the stock exchange market by say in Tanzania getting experienced
 professionals as the International Finance Company Corporation IFC to undertake a thorough study and make recommendations on }{\b\v <+_article>}{ needed course of action instead of the present haphazard handling of the matter }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
Honourable chief guests these are but a few uh pertinent observations that should not be overlooked in our endeavour to <./>re restructure our parastatal organisations }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
Much more and in <-_a> finer detail will be taken up in the following papers to be presented and discussed in this symposium }{\lang2057 <#/>}{

making <-_a> gradual <./>progr progress in promoting foreign investment <#/>Although in the seminar you will be discussing the ways to promote further investment opportunities and the deployment of our own resources it is also important to focus on the hi
storical background of our economic development <#/>We all know that after attaining independence our economic sector was <-_under><+_in>}{\b  }{\b\v <&/>prep}{ }{\lang2057 
private hands and mostly foreigners <#/>The state therefore took control of all major means of production after the launching of }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\lang2057

 control of the state <#/>Our country also became a one-party state <#/>The major me
ans of production which were nationalized after independence were as I said predominantly in foreign hands and they were geared towards the colonial interests <#/>The nationalization exercise therefore was aimed at directing the economic sector to serve t
he interests of the majority of }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\lang2057  Tanzanian population <#/>And this was a vital step }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_in>}{\v\lang2057  }{\lang2057 
implementing our policy of socialism and self-reliance <#/>Nationalization therefore enabled }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\lang2057  Tanzanian population to enjoy free social services
 <#/>Free education free medical services were provided by the state out of the nationalized economic sector <#/>Nationalization was therefore the only <./>idea ideal way to distribute equitably the national cake among the majority of the poor <-_Tanzania

<+_Tanzanian> peasants <#/>Although the exercise was welcomed and supported by the majority of poor Tanzanians it was faced with problems <#/>After nationalization we experienced the problem of lack of expertise to manage the economic institutions <#/>Bot
h
 managerial technical skills were lacking in most of the nationalized institutions <#/>Apart from this problem the sector was faced with the problem of capital investment <#/>The industries therefore produced below capacity due to lack of sufficient input
s
 power failure poor infrastructure mismanagement coupled with the embezzlements and sabotage <#/>This trend therefore led to the collapse of some of our parastatals <#/>Bora Shoe Company stands as a good example <#/>The economic performance under state co
ntrol became worse in the late nineteen seventies because of the following factors <#/>There was severe drought which forced the government to spend the major foreign <-_reserve><+_reserves> to import }{\b\v\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\lang2057 
 food instead of agricultural or industrial imports <#/>The collapse of }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\lang2057 
 East <-_>of East African<-/> community forced the government to re-allocate the major resources to form our own organizations airways harbours railways post and telecommunications <#/>Another factor which contributed 
to the worse economic performance was the war with Idi Amin of Uganda <#/>The government had to deviate }{\b\v\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\lang2057 
 our national resources from economic ventures to finance the war which although we eventually won left the country in economic pledge <#/>The control of the economy by <-/>by }{\b\v\lang2057 <&/>clearing his throat}{\v\lang2057  }{\lang2057 
the state therefore did not accelerate the expected economic progress <#/>The economic performance remained poor <#/>And this in turn led to the poor services service provision in the social sector 
<#/>Unfortunately the private sector both indigenous and foreign which could have filled the gap had been largely discouraged to operate alongside with the public sector }{\b\v\lang2057 <&/>coughing}{\v\lang2057  }{\lang2057 
<#/>You may here recall that the Arusha Declaration had forbidden anybody aspiring to be a leader to own any economic venture however small it could have been }{\b\v\lang2057 <&/>grammar/tense}{\v\lang2057  }{\lang2057 
<#/>This concept therefore led to the potential individuals to fail }{\b\v\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\lang2057  to contribute to the national economic growth <#/>}{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\lang2057 
 Agricultural sector which was the backbone of our economy did not perform well because of various factors <#/>The majority of peasants could not improve and increase their agricultural output because of the high costs of imports and falling prices of the
 
agricultural goods in the world market <#/>The farmers became victims because they were forced to accept the low prices for their coffee cotton sisal and other agricultural products <#/>Farmers unlike the industrial producers were not able to control the 
prices of the agricultural goods <#/>This means therefore that even their great <./>agr agricultural sector performance was not very good for reasons explained <#/>This analysis therefore helps to explain why our economy remained <-_under><+_in> }{\b\v

 as leaders and try to see who is a leader }{\lang2057 <#/>}{We are all leaders and we are all seated there as leaders }{\lang2057 <#/>}{So probably when I describe a leader you have the freedom to accept or to reject that }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
First I say that a leader is lazy letting others in the group do the work }{\lang2057 <#/>}{Two the leader is crazy believing that others will do the work }{\lang2057 <#/>}{Third the leader is stupid attempting impossible tasks even after the final no }{
\lang2057 <#/>}{A leader is ignorant always a student asking stupid questions eager to learn }{\lang2057 <#/>}{A leader is foolish working hard dedicated receiving little material reward }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
A leader is brazen stepping forward when others shy away putting duty before career }{\lang2057 <#/>}{A leader is <_/impetus> daring to question the validity of the underlying assumptions of sacred cows as their relation to the past present and future }{

A leader is <-/indisciplined> and individual in the absence of orders initiates and executes the right course of action }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
A leader is incompetent seeking help when needed no matter what light it throws on the leader's competence in getting the job done }{\lang2057 <#/>}{And lastly a leader is weak letting those around be individuals by allowing them to have the <

Honourable Minister ladies and gentlemen at this concluding ceremony of

all the business which started on Monday twenty-fourth <./>ninetee January nineteen ninety-four to such a successful conclusion }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
The deliberations of our workshop and indeed those of the region's executive committee meeting have opened a new chapter in the development of disabled people in the whole of eastern Africa }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
The workshop came up with very interesting and practical <-_resolution><+_resolutions> whose implementation by all parties concerned will definitely ensure a new life for disabled people a life which they have been denied for a long time in the region }{
\lang2057 <#/>}{For decades eastern African countries have been undergoing all kinds of social economic political and in some cases religious problems and under such conditions and throughout these decad

Therefore through this EAFOD we now have a powerful and loud voice of disabled people in the part in this part of the world }{\lang2057 <#/>}{Through unity we are going to make that voice ever louder and stronger }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
Our governments in the region need to receive and accept all the resolutions which were made by the workshop participants }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
On behalf of all my colleagues in eastern Africa I would like to thank uh the government of Zanzibar and the government of Tanzania for all the support that }{\v <+_}{\b\v they}{\v > }{have given us and to enable us successfully }{\b\v <+_to>}{\v  }{

With this short conclusive remark honourable guest of honour on behalf of EAFOD and on behalf of the participants of the workshop I would like to read to you and to all those present the resolutions that were adopted uh at the workshop }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
These resolutions are supposed not to be uh papers to be filed in the files but these are going to be papers that have to be you know to be implemented for the benefit and development of disabled people in the region }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
So these are the resolutions which are adopted }{\lang2057 <#/>}{Preamble }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
This first Eastern African Federation of the Disabled meeting of training of trainers workshop which brought together thirty delegates from eleven EAFOD member countries to discus

ave created for them }{\lang2057 <#/>}{

Aware of the discrimination unfair treatment and exploitation to which people with disabilities have been and continue to be subjected in all areas of social political and economic life and participation as well as their marginalisa

Reaffirming again the need to involve people's disabilities and their organisations in all matters affecting them especially at decision making and policy formulation levels national planning and social 
reconstruction on matters affecting disabled persons }{\lang2057 <#/>}{We therefore would like to part to put forward the following resolutions and uh put to the government of the east African region and uh to the following demands }{\b\v <&/>structure}{
\v  }{with }{\b\v <+_article>}{ urgency they <-/they> deserve }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
One EAFOD should take a long road to ensure equal and full participation of women with disabilities in all its structures which will eventually permeate their total involvement and participation at local national and regional <-_level><+_levels> }{
\lang2057 <#/>}{Mindful that in some countries in the region women including women with disabilities have no right to <-/>to inheritance EAFOD has resolved to fight for this evil practice to be abolished be it set up it\rquote s }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 backed by legislative or traditional law }{\lang2057 <#/>}{Two EAFOD should fight with their respective governments in the region for their rights to education health employment housing transport information etcetera }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
Number three United Nations and its agencies sho
uld unreservedly condemn and isolate regimes which allow the violation of the rights of disabled people such as dragging disabled people from villages to urban centres to turn them into clubs of beggars for the benefit of those perpetrating the <-/violato
rs> }{\lang2057 <#/>}{At the same time the United Nations and its agencies and governments should take every necessary step to ensure that child labour which has been on the increase in recent years is pulled to a halt }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
Four Governments in eastern Africa in consultation with national associations of the deaf should accept and develop }{\b\v <+_article>}{ sign language as an official language of deaf persons }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
Five Governments in eastern Africa should take it as their obligation toward ensuring that people with disabilities are provided with free and appropriate assisted devices for <-_the> independent living }{\lang2057 <#/>}{Six Having disagreed with }{\b\v 
<+_article>}{ WHO definition of CBR CBR means Community Based Rehabilitation which is <O/> the participants emphasised the need for DPI}{\b\v <&/>cough}{\v  }{
and its structure to redefine the present CBR concept so that its components embody total development of disabled people their full participation and rehabilitation of the community }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
Seven EAFOD should take every necessary step to run their day to day activities democratically }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
Those with experience should impart knowledge to the young and emerging leaders as well as avoid dictatorial tendencies of having lifetime leaders }{\lang2057 <#/>}{Eight EAFOD should strive for total unity of disability groups and the org
anisation of eastern Africa through exchange of information and visits training programme sharing of resources and promoting marketing of products produced by the disabled people }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
Nine EAFOD should strive for increased development of eastern Africa and southern African co-operation in all fields of development as a step towards the formation of a Pan African Federation of the Disabled }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
Ten which is the last but not least resolution EAFOD should through its national governments and authorities in the r
egion formulate and enforce comprehensive legislation to promote and protect the rights and interests of disabled persons and thereby ensure disabled persons of access to all community services }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
These are the ten point recommendations or resolutions rat
her which were adopted by the uh <-/>the participants of the workshop and uh these of course are going to be distributed to all governments of the region and then we'll have to <-/>to make a follow-up to see that these resolutions don't end up in dustbins
 
as it happened in some countries where the world programme of action concerning disabled persons was put in the dustbin up to the mid-term evaluation when other governments were <./>eve <-/>were not even aware that that United Nations document was availab

do feel at home <#/>Mr Chairman I don't need to stress the urgency of this workshop at this stage of Zanzibar's tourism development since tourism is now the world the world's fastest growing industry and according to the nineteen ninety-two report of the 
W
orld Travel and Tourism Council between nineteen seventy and nineteen ninety the number of tourists travelling in the world grew by nearly three hundred per cent <#/>It is expected to grow by half again before the turn of the century <#/>Tourism is now in

 <#/>The very trust to economic organisation made by the Zanzibar government over the past ten years is an attempt to diversify <-_>to diversify<-/> <O_>}{\b\v two words}{
<O/> of isles away from the from its earlier dependence on the mono-<O/> economy <#/>The touris

 is trying her }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ best to make sure that those two monstrous <./>hin <./>hin hindrances are solved as soon as time could allow }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 <#/>Esteemed delegates it may be good to mention that other segments of the tourism industry are also developing to keep pace with the increase of tourists arrivals which have risen by twenty pe
r cent per year since nineteen eighty-five <#/>This is about uh sixty-four thousand tourists in nineteen ninety-two <#/>Recently fifteen of Zanzibar\rquote

with a capacity of seventy-two students <#/>Mr Chairman as partly concern amounts over the growing threat of the global environment and attention focuses on the need to manage the major resources more sustainably the human <./>com community has now to ass
ume a more conscious attitude and the operations of the world's major industries must now come under increasing scrutiny <#/>It is important therefore to bring tourism as one tool in }{\b\v <+_article>}{
 global and growing industry within the general debate for sustainable development <#/>It <-/>it\rquote 
ll <-/>it is the intention of the Zanzibar government to develop a high class environmentally <./>cons environmentally sensitive tourism industry that brings benefit thus to the <-_>to the<-/> national economy and to the <

of this history being the Zanzibar Old Stone Town }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 with all the urge to restore the life of all the palaces and castles in both Zanzibar and Pemba <#/>The old mosques and the archaeological findings will all be put into view <#/>Very rare species

the process of producing plans for the <./>esub for the establishment and management of nature conservation areas <#/>These have the potential to channel money from the tourism industry <O/> into the conservation of some of Zanzibar's richest and most imp

<O/> to the local culture <#/>While it is not easy to <./>da deny the fact it would be wrong to magnify it beyond proportion <#/>Tou

 <#/>Chairperson again on my behalf and on behalf of the government of Tanzania I wish to congratulate you for the formation of <-_a> regional co-operation <#/>You have taken the right channel to form the Eastern Afr

n
g identified their skill gaps as regards knowledge skill and attitudes as you have said yourself in the resolution now they need special attention <#/>Some societies had disregarded them some time ago and some still segregate them <#/>Chairperson I'm glad
 
to say that our country Tanzania is aware of the problems facing this group of persons <#/>We have been trying our best to integrate them in all our social and economic development activities according to our economic ability <#/>During the fiscal year of
 nineteen ninety-two nineteen ninety-three about two hundred and twenty-two disabled people attended courses in different special training institutions for }{\b\v <+_article>}{
 disabled <#/>They were trained in agriculture animal husbandry crafts-making electronics 
carpentry etcetera <#/>Chairperson I'm glad to mention that Tanzania is also ahead in caring for its disadvantaged people as follows <#/>About seventy-three people I mean disabled people were employed <#/>Two hundred and fifty-six were assisted self-emplo

 were given motorbikes <#/>Fifty were given three-wheeled bikes <#/>Fifty-one were given artificial legs or arms shoes and guidesticks <#/>Two hundred disabled in Iringa village were given loans to the tune of seventeen uh million to enable them }{\b\v

be trained on in vocational training centres and other trade schools <#/>All this will be done in collaboration with UNDP ILO SHIA and all who intend to raise a revolving fund for the disabled for <./>sitt for setting up small business projects to assist 
t
hem under the Community Based Rehabilitation Scheme <#/>Chairperson I have only been trying to show how Tanzania our country is striving to assist and accommodate the disabled person <#/>Much of this data is based on Tanzanian mainland experience but also
 in Zanzibar here I was also told that the government has tried its <-/>its best <#/>It gave them an office so that they make it as }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 <-_headquarter><+_headquarters> <#/>It also gave them one flat so that they can rent and get money so that they c
an generate funds for themselves and uh most of their let us say seminars sometimes they get some funds from the government so it shows both Tanzania mainland and Tanzania island are taking care of our disabled people <#/>So I believe all our countries wi
l
l do the same <#/>Chairperson another area which requires extra effort from all areas especially among the disabled <-_person><+_persons> themselves is that of social equity <#/>Everywhere we have of late heard of social equity which advocates equitable d
istribution of benefits in <./>develme <-/>in development throughout the society <#/>However people in the rural areas and the disabled persons rarely benefit <#/>This has to be rectified and those who are supposed to advocate for }{\b\v <&/>prep}{
 this change are t
he disabled persons yourselves <#/>Chairperson here I need also to mention the plight of the disabled women <#/>Women in general have struggled very hard to be where they are now and they still struggle to get their rights and recognition <#/>I've no doub
t disabled women in our societies are more disadvantaged than their male counterparts }{\b\v <&/>applause}{
 <#/>Many of them are left behind and they are not given the chance to participate in decision-making and taking other leadership roles <#/>Disabled women are 
denied the basic human rights of education training economic independence and participation in society compared to their fellow disabled men <#/>Social cultural attitudinal and structural barriers play a significant role in undermining the women's develop

 <#/>I've <-_>I have<-/> also been informed that Disabled Peoples International of which you 
are a part of has a solid stand to see to it that in all its governing councils and representations right from the grassroot level there is an equal representation between male and female gender }{\b\v <&/>applause}{
 <#/>This is very encouraging and I congratulate 
these bodies for realising this deficiency <#/>Chairperson during your <O/> meeting with the <-_participant><+_participants> here you have exchanged a lot of information and some of you have developed that important human link of friendship <#/>But friend

 honest and genuine relationship when those who regard themselves are far apart <#/>This is the right occasion to prove that the friendship you have cultivated is an honest one <#/>Dear participants this can be done by

Mr Chairman statistics show that the Tanzania parastatal <-_>the Tanzania parastatal<-/> cannot be ignored in planning our economy }{<#/>}{\lang2057 The parastatal sector has th
e capacity to contribute significantly to the economic well-being of our country }{<#/>}{\lang2057 Unfortunately it also has a capacity to drag the economy of our country backwards }{\b\v\lang2057 <&/>idiom}{\lang2057 
 and thus harming the aspirations of our people }{<#/>}{\lang2057 Mr Chairman there is evidence that the parastatal sector can exhibit a great deal of creativity efficiency and a sense of accountability }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
Unfortunately there is also evidence of some parastatals that are the sick creatures of our economy and the worst examples of lack of imagination inefficiency and irresponsibility }{<#/>}{\lang2057 This is the parastatal predicament }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
This is what makes the behaviour of the parastatal sector so unpredictable }{<#/>}{\lang2057 Mr Chairman consider the following phenomena }{<#/>}{\lang2057 In nineteen eighty-five a hundred and thirty-eight parastatals had their accounts unaudited }{<#/>}
{\lang2057 What a situation }{<#/>}{\lang2057 In nineteen eighty-nine parastatals in this category were reduced to <./>eigh <-/>to eighty-five from hundred and thirty-eight }{<#/>}{\lang2057 This is quite an achievement but certainly not a complet
e achievement }{<#/>}{\lang2057 Nineteen eighty-five in nineteen eighty-five thirty-seven point uh one per cent of }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\lang2057  parastatals received clean certificates from the auditors }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
In nineteen eighty-nine this figure jumped to <-_nineteen><+_ninety> fifty-one point one per cent }{<#/>}{\lang2057 This shows a capacity by the parastatals to improve significantly their handling of accounts }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
In the view of the topic chosen for this year\rquote s uh uh <-_>chosen for this year\rquote s<-/> TAPO\rquote s symposium we should note the importance of pro
per bookkeeping and financial management and discipline that a parastatal ought to have if it is to be commercially viable }{<#/>}{\lang2057 On the whole we have cause for hope }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
Reading through the reports of the <-/>the Tanzania Audit Corporation the number of uh <-_>the number of<-/> uh uh certified uh of clean certificates <-_>the number of clean certificates<-/> were reduced dramatically }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
No the number of no-opinion certificates were reduced dramatically from sixty-five to three in the period nineteen eighty-fi
ve to nineteen eighty-nine and partially clean certificates uh dropped from hundred and fifty-nine to forty-one during the same period }{<#/>}{\lang2057 Mr Chairman I repeat Tanzania cannot afford to ignore the state of the parastatal sector }{<#/>}{
\lang2057 As for the party and the government the parastatal sector will continue to be important because of its double-track impact }{<#/>}{\lang2057 Uh consider the revenue enjoyed by the government through taxation }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
In nineteen eighty-seven eighty-eight parastatals contributed shillings four point nine billion to }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\lang2057  treasury }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
In nineteen eighty-nine ninety the treasury enjoyed a revenue of uh shillings ten point five billion }{<#/>}{\lang2057 On the other hand losses in the parastatal sector rose from shillings uh two <-/>two 
billion point eight uh in nineteen eighty-five to shillings twenty-nine billion point one in nineteen eighty-nine }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
The National Milling Corporation alone is said to have cost the government treasury about uh eight billion <-_>eight billion<-/> shillings during its lifetime }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
Let me make a political statement about this predicament of the status of the parastatal sector in our economy }{<#/>}{\lang2057 The party will not be so foolish as to ignore the positive aspects of our parastatals in terms of their contribution
 to investment mobilization growth of }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\lang2057  national productive capacity }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\lang2057  supply of essential goods and services availability of employment }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
Nor will the party ever ignore the parastatal role in providing the necessary competition to th
e firms in the private <-_>in the private<-/> sector and to balancing the ethnic question of ownership of means of production and <./>dis distribution in our country }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
Mr Chairman on the other hand CCM and its government can no longer hesitate to take th
e necessary measures to counter the negative economic manifestations in our parastatals such as perpetual losses in some of them disorganized management systems and dependence on <-_the> government money or bank loans that are not paid }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
Mr Chairman today in this symposium of }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\lang2057  <-_Tanzania><+_Tanzanian> Association of Parastatal Organisation you are discussing }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\lang2057  commercialization of the parastatals in Tanzania }{
<#/>}{\lang2057 Let me quickly agree that that is indeed what is happening in Tanzania }{<#/>}{\lang2057 I believe that the intensity towards such commercialization will grow and not lessen at all }{\b\v\lang2057 <&/>break in recording }{\lang2057 
that the insensitivity towards such commercialization will grow and will not lessen at all }{<#/>}{\lang2057 There is no future in Tanzania for economic
 parastatals which cannot stand on their own but are perpetually bailed out by the taxpayers through subsidies from the government treasury }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
I cannot see any future for training parastatals which cannot or will not make profits from their operations }{<#/>}{\lang2057 Mr Chairman such parastatals are doomed }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
Yes Mr Chairman and members of TAPO our parastatals must go commercial and must make profits }{<#/>}{\lang2057 It is clear that the people of Tanzania have exhausted their patience with respect to parastatals which believe th
at they have a right to exist even if they are not earning that right or are not even trying to earn it }{<#/>}{\lang2057 I believe ideology alone is no longer a <O/> alibi for loss-making parastatals to shield in }{\b\v\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\lang2057  }{
<#/>}{\lang2057 The party and the government I believe that the <-/>the people as well are now no under no illusion that loss-making and subsidy dependent parastatals are a liability and not an asset to our efforts for economic recovery }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
Such parastatals are a discredit not a credit to the policy of socialism and self-reliance }{<#/>}{\lang2057 Tanzania is going through a sea change right now uh not unlike that which is occurring in the world around us }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
The sea change will <./>no <-/>will demand political reforms but also particular changes in economic perceptions prospectives and values }{<#/>}{\lang2057 In this situation men of <-/>men and women I must say men and women I wrote men here}{\b\lang2057  }

They will and I think they are being discarded }{<#/>}{\lang2057 In economics and business Tanzania has already reached a stage of giving great appreciation to results on the welfare of the people and not just to forms of ownership of an enterprise }{<#/>
}{\lang2057 Appreciation will go to the <./>enper enterprise that delivers at least cost <-_>that delivers at least cost<-/> and with efficiency regardless of whether it is a public or a private institution of an <-_>of an<_/> <./>enter enterprise }{<#/>}
{\lang2057 I believe Mr Chairman that }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\lang2057  time has arrived and ought to arrive the time for giving the parastatal monopoly status is gone }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
The <./>ti <-/>the time for <./>follo <-/>for allowing competition on serving the public has come }{<#/>}{\lang2057 The time for tolerating a sluggish manageme
nt in the parastatals that cannot seize investment opportunities that cannot cut costs even when <./>opport opportunities exist that cannot compete in the marketing functions that cannot motivate its labour that will not make necessary but difficult decis

\b\v\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\lang2057  policy }{<#/>}{\lang2057 They are implied in the decisions of the party to promote equally both the public and private investment through the investment code }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
They are implied in the liberalisation of external and internal trade }{<#/>}{\lang2057 They are implied in the decisions of the <name/
> commission report with its emphasis on opening up to the public purchase of shares stocks and ventures including those in the banking sectors }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
These positions are already being implemented in the decision to ask loss-making parastatals to seek salvation not from the Treasury but from the private investors through such schemes as joint ventures uh partnerships and indeed <./>privat privatization 
}{<#/>}{\lang2057 Mr Chairman let me tell you my friends from the parastatal sectors those who have eyes to see would have <./> see <-_>would have<-/> already seen those with ears to hear will have heard and those with }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{
\lang2057  audacity to seize new <-_opportunity><+_opportunities> will see the situation as not threatening but definitely challenging }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
Let me say that the drive for commercialization of our parastatals must be accompanied by measures that enable parastatals to play this <./>ro <-/>this role }{<#/>}{\lang2057 You have yourself mentioned some of them }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
These policy and practical measures must include a real granting of autonomy to parastatal enterprises and <./>indepen <-/>and companies }{<#/>}{\lang2057 It is vital that most decisions that affect their performance and discretion must be restored }{
\b\v\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\lang2057  to the management and boards of directors of the parastatals themselves }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
These should include decisions on employees' morale and motivation quality quantity and prices of goods and services produced financial decisions etcetera }{<#/>}{\lang2057 Such types of decision must no longer reside outside the parastatals }{<#/>}{
\lang2057 I hope our friends from uh <-/>from uh <name/> are not too worried about this statement }{\b\v\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\lang2057  }{<#/>}{\lang2057 I also believe that in certain cases especially where there is <-_a> s
tiff competition from external producers government should review taxation policies including level of sales tax for home-produced goods and of customs duties for imported goods }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
All these measures should create the right environment for parastatals to apply themselves with full vigour on the basis of normal commercial principles and practices }{<#/>}{\lang2057 
There may be these and other measures which are necessary to make a success of <./>pri <-/>of privatisation of the <-_>of the<_/> parastatal sector }{<#/>}{\lang2057 <ea/>Nd

\par <I> <#/>I would like to thank the minister very much for his contribution of these personal views about multipartism because I believe he did not speak as a minister but as a human being who is free to contribute his i

\par <#/>I'm Pastor Christopher Mtikila uh uh <#/>I agree with both the two previous speakers to a large extent except where it touches on the feasibility of multipartism in Tanzania <#/>Maybe to be more precise and to be better understood I should define what
 
is the meaning of human rights of civil rights of democracy and a political party <#/>I understand human rights to be the rights of human beings be them blue green or white wherever they are provided they have not resigned from humanity to become other th
ings <#/>Then there <O/> a separate entitlement to those rights <#/>Civil rights is what we were fighting for under the umbrella of TANU way back in the late fifties and achieved them I think on the ninth}{\b  }{\b\v <+_of>}{\v  }{
December sixty-one or sixty-two <#/>I don't k
now what we got in each in both the years but the two years consolidated our entitlement to civil rights <#/>And what TANU was actually fighting for was not good roads was not bread butter and cheese <#/>I think we had plenty from England those days and v
ery cheaply }{\b\v <&/>laughter}{
 <#/>It was nothing <#/>It was only the human right to participation one's participation in his own country and we said we were by then nine and a half million people so all of us were human beings <#/>So each one of the nine and a h
alf human beings had entitlement to that civil right <#/>Anyway a few breaths away uh a smaller group from the nine and a half million people grabbed that right from the rest of the people <#/>That's what I understand }{\b\v <&/>laughter}{
 <#/>I always have difficulty <-_of><+_in> }{\b\v <&/>prep}{
 merging reality and diplomacy when I deliver my speeches <#/>You can do it to suit your own understanding anyway <#/>Now democracy there people talk about multiparty democracy and one party democracy <#/>But I read English I think
 as much as you did <#/>I want to think that democracy is the right to freedom of opinion and the right to freedom of expression of that opinion and the right to freedom of participation in the ruling in the governing in the running of one's own country t
h
rough that freely opted-for opinion <#/>So when we talk about a democratic country we talk about a climate a political climate where we have got so many freely opted-for opinions <#/>So here it is important to know what a political party is then <#/>A pol
i
tical party is supposed to be one such opinion one political party is one such opinion which is shared by a group of individuals of a particular country who commit themselves fully to that opinion making an identity between that opinion and their own virt
u
es <#/>It is an entitlement <#/>So I would oppose anybody who would say for the shortcomings economically and socially in our country we do away with the party which is responsible for this <#/>It would be very sinful because they have their entitlement <
#
/>They must be there and I was sent to defend them and join them if they <-_>if they<-/> change <#/>But that would not give me entitlement to grab other people's similar right because after all our banner is human equality <#/>So when we talk about multip
a
rtism we should be careful about bringing in the word feasibility <#/>In the sixties we had a bitter war which we fought using the United Nations and so many international fora <#/>We were trying to convince people in the west to reason with us that we ar
e
 as equal human beings as they are <#/>We were rejecting their suggestions that we were <./>un uncivilised we were a cursed race even when they tried to equate us intelligently and diplomatically to monkeys <#/>We resisted it in the strongest terms until 
t
hey came to agree with us that we were on equal status <#/>So those people are human beings and they decided to agree also that we were also human beings <#/>So the united the <-/>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights under articles nineteen <./>twent
 
twenty-one twenty-three sections one to three and twenty-five section one which describe which enshrine the sacred human rights of every human being wherever he is and to which our system here is signatory <./>force forces those people to help us remember
 
that we agreed we are going to be as equal human beings as them <#/>Now since they observe human rights in their homes in Europe and America etcetera etcetera we should do the same here <#/>So if we turn to them and say <-/>uhu we understand that we fough
t for this equality very much but as for human rights we shall have to think about it if is feasible in our country because we don't have only human beings we also have got other things other than human beings <#/>Is that to say so }{\b\v <&/>idiom}{
 <#/>We cannot t
alk about economy we cannot talk about social uh eventualities and justify them to deny us the rights civil rights in the country or human rights <#/>We cannot talk about events in other countries which led to their search for human rights in their own co
u
ntries because we have entitlement here whether or not there are changes in Europe or in Eastern Europe <#/>It is an entitlement be ourselves be us educated or not we need to feel part of the population of this country <#/>So if it is a human right for an
y
 human being wherever he is in his or <-_>in his or<-/> her own country to have a share in the governing of that country of being elected to government or electing then if I'm denied here automatically and straight away without any compromise <#/>I'm bein
g
 denied ingredients of my humanity which I probably should seek elsewhere <#/>I don't know whether I should cross borders and go and seek my human rights in other people's countries <#/>So I appreciate all the changes taking place elsewhere in the world e
v
en in South Africa for that matter where we <-/>we have been I think in the forefront fighting apartheid because we are not racists we say because the majority were denied civil rights in their own country <#/>They had more bread more butter better houses
 
better education better everything but they felt more comfortable when they came here as refugees because they found us enjoying civil rights which they are denied in their home at their home <#/>Whether they were denied the rights because of pigment or n
o
t I remember our country has always supported people who were denied such rights by the people of their own <./>pigm pigments in their own countries <#/>So I would say there is a another version of apartheid in other countries that apartheid is of a group
 of stronger people who grab all the power }{\b\v <&/>laughter}{
 from their fellow citizens like our system here that is black to black apartheid <#/>So what we are doing now is we should not debate on whether human rights would be good for those who have been polit
ically deprived <#/>People are misunderstanding us and I'm misunderstanding myself and even those the integrity of those people who say so I freely say and that uh I cannot lose touch with reality <#/>And even the commission I thank the first speaker and 
o
ur chairman <#/>He's praised it very much and has told told us the sense of the commission being there <#/>I totally disagree with the idea of forming that <-/>that commission if it's for looking for views as to whether human right would be good suitable 
f
or the human beings of Tanzania because that would justify what the western has used to say that we are a barbaric race etcetera etcetera <#/>Today we have lost the privilege of defending ourselves by forming such commissions <#/>But if it were a commissi
on to go and prepare and look out how we shall reinstitute human rights in our country I would write an application to the chairman of CCM to be included in that commission }{\b\v <&/>laughter}{
 <#/>So we should not go away we should not mention any other thing <#/>
Even thieves and murders if they are they have nation if they have got citizenship anywhere they are they are entitled to civil rights <#/>Their crimes are very very different they cannot sabotage their rights they cannot take them away <#/>They have also
 got their civil rights to imprisonment if they fall criminal }{\b\v <&/>laughter}{ <#/>But we are not going to deny them <#/>That is the most important thing we should talk about <#/>The second speaker mentioned about }{\b\v <&/>prep}{\v  }{
the Zanzibar revolution <#/>Maybe that
 was very good because it helped me explain a little about the democracy that we have and the need for multipartism in our country <#/>The problem is not that people did not think about their rights their civil rights in this country <#/>They have always 
been knowing }{\b\v <&/>grammar/aspect}{
 that they have the right and our constitution also states very clearly that we have got these political rights to multipartism <#/>There are so many contradictions in our constitution and there are people who try to walk in t
hat constitution to to demand their civil rights <#/>We know what happened to them <#/>They were tortured victimised and imprisoned etcetera etcetera until one man <./>out outside the constitution said that we can now debate the human rights <#/>He is not
 
sure whether we are really human beings to deserve human rights <#/>So that <-/>that <./>con convinces me to believe that a monoparty state a monoparty a supreme party is a personal property because the man at the top can never be opposed <#/>The <name/> 
p
arty in Iraq can never oppose Mr <./>Saba <-/>Mr Saddam Hussein and so many other examples <#/>So with our union it is very difficult <#/>I think what we should be discussing is how we should amend innovate our constitution to be suitable to suit the chan
g
es which we desire because with a union I <-/>I doubt very much if the commission would even come out with anything because the parliament in parliament one a <./>six uh sixty thousand Zanzibaris islanders are represented by one man <#/>So all of the <-_>
o
f the<-/> people in the islands are represented <#/>If we take the same ratio to the mainland we find that in a population of twenty-four million only twenty-three million and four hundred thousand are represented in parliament <#/>If we take we <./>tran 
t
ransfer that under the umbrella in the principle of equality the same representation in Zanzibar we take it to the mainland so we see even there the democracy is so loose <#/>I'd not see it because we take sixty thousand people of mainland Tanzania and pi
c
k a representative for them <#/>So we shall have all of them representing only six hundred thousand like the Zanzibaris <#/>So all others are unrepresented <#/>There are all these things and we talk about national consensus on in all our national uh decis
ions <#/>I would not remember to have had }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ one national consensus for the union anyway because I remember the former president said that what we are going to discuss about }{\b\v <&/>prep}{
 is not the question whether we need one party or many parties but how we are going to institute a one-party system 
\par }{\v <$X> No no no
\par }{<#/>So there was no consensus national consensus there <#/>That's what he said <#/>He said we are not going to discuss about }{\b\v <&/>prep}{ whether multi-partism is good or monopartism no <#/>We are only going to discuss about }{\b\v <&/>prep}{
 how to institute a one-party system <#/>National consensus is out there <#/>Even the union as <-/>as actually for the union I've got a very very funny idea about it all
\par <X_>}{\v <$B> <#/>Can you please be brief because uh if w
e talk at this rate you will be the only one who participates in this discussion You notice even this morning the remarks were very brief indeed and I'd like as many people to participate in this discussion as possible I don't want to cut you short
\par <$X> you are right 
\par <$B> <#/>but let us be precise and uh to the point and let others also have a chance to air their views Please}{</X>
\par <#/>Yaah actually I have almost finished what I wanted to say only that on the question of the union again there was no national con
sensus <#/>It was something that was done single-handedly by one person although he had some good reasons to assign to his decision which does not uh <-_>does not<-/> tally with democracy anyway so multipartism is true democracy because it represents the 
i
deas and the thinking of all other people such that even economically and socially we had antagonised the ideas some very positive ideas of people because they thought outside the framework of the one party so we threw away what they had to offer to this 
c
ountry because they should offer it under an <./>um a political umbrella of a party <#/>So the country's fallen casualty to all the <-_predicament><+_predicaments> that every one understands <#/>So human rights civil rights and democracy and the meaning o
f a political party should guide us in thinking about whether the commissions are right or not and whether we should have any debate on human rights at all because we'd be resigning from humanity if we do so </I>

\par <I> <X_>}{\v Thank you Mr Chairman It was }{</X> For a number of reasons I decided to restructure my paper <#/>Although the title is the same <#/>It's on recent land changes in land tenure and its implication in the livelihood comm
unities in the drylands of Tanzania <#/>Now there is a myth in Tanzania that land is so abundant uh that uh we don't have to worry and yet there are tenural shortages and these tenural shortages is }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 especially acute in the areas of the dryland mainly because of the <./>appro <-_>because of the<-/> conflicts between the appropriate type of conventional theories regarding dryland use and two because of the social dimensions of the problems of }{\b\v 
<+_article>}{ livelihood of pastoralists and agro-pastoral
ists <#/>The importance of land even to people in the drylands cannot be exaggerated because land gave people identity it gave them their basic resource uh and above all it was a method of both livelihood and survival of the community <#/>In terms of the 
l
and use I think the nineteen twenty-three uh land ordinance of Tanzania was extremely important because it introduced a duality system uh of tenure in which there was a deemed right versus the title rights <#/>And what is interesting is that this duality 
m
oved at Independence and it is now being tried to be justified under the liberalisation uh model that Tanzania is trying to adapt or adopt <#/>Now putting changes in land tenure in context in the socio-political changes that have taken place in the countr
y I think are }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 extremely important and it is in here that one of the reasons why I'm particularly interested in this is that the country as a whole is more agrarian based rather than pastorally based <#/>The arid lands <#/>The climatic boundaries
 define where it is roughly an area of uh between six hundred and eight hundred millimetres of rainfall where permanent agriculture is not possible and there are various uh figures given as to how big this area is the semi-arid is <#/>The figure varies fr
o
m between twenty-five to seventy-five per cent of the country and between thirty-five and seventy-five per cent of the country <#/>Those are two <-/>two extremes really <#/>If you notice the figure of seventy-five per cent that does not occur all <-/>all 
<
-/>all the time and so I think critical are the twenty-five and thirty-five per cent of the country <#/>Roughly speaking this is in the centre of the country <#/>To me the heartland of the dry areas are that boundary there but when we talk about seventy-f
i
ve per cent it could be once in every five or seven years or eleven years depending uh you'll find that the boundary extends to this other extreme giving us our seventy-five per cent <#/>Now most people regard the drylands as homogeneous <#/>The fact of t
h
e matter is that none of this thing none of the drylands are really homogeneous and it is in here that for example we'll find juxtapositions between pastoralists you have people practising irrigation <#/>And yet the general practices in the country partic
ularly uh with the abolishment of the uh <-_>of the<-/> uh customary rights these things uh are completely distorted to give an impression that we're dealing with a homogeneous system <#/>Changes which occurred in the tenural system I think uh are at }{
\b\v <+_article>}{ present moment under great uh they are under great uh uh pressure to conform <#/>African governments both and the people are <-_in><+_under> }{\b\v <&/>prep}{
 enormous pressure to conform to western norms and number one to remain as primary producers and two 
to extend into non-traditional exports for example flowers vegetables citrus etcetera which tend to move into the semi-arid areas and into the arid areas <#/>And lastly you've got to look at these changes in terms of progression growth and settlement <#/>
W
e are not only dealing with numbers but access to basic rights <#/>In the drylands it's not only land alone but I'll argue that it is a cluster of resources that uh we've got to be concerned with which once again tenure does not look at uh adequately <#/>
For example in the semi-arid areas and arid areas land water pasture cattle all go together <#/>In fact you can have ownership of uh cattle not only <-_to><+_by> }{\b\v <&/>prep}{ individuals but also <-_to><+_by> }{\b\v <&/>prep}{
 the whole society <#/>There has also been concern about the marginality of improvement to the productivity of both agriculturalists as well as among the pastoralists the interventions for example have led to further scarcities <#/>These scarcities have o
c
curred both naturally as well as because of societal pressure <#/>For example if we look at land in Tanzania although they say a lot of it is available by nineteen forty-eight per capita the distribution was roughly eleven point eight hectares <#/>By nine
t
een eighty-eight it's down to three point nine <#/>And not only that but we'll find that one of the main pressures in fact on the land use because of state ownership is that twenty-five per cent of the country is either in terms of national parks game res
erves and an increasing amount under urban areas uh <#/>Thirdly there's this conflict between game-controlled areas national parks uh for example in the <-_>in the<-/> Maasai area out of the total uh area of sixty-three thousand square kilometres by }{
\b\v <+_article>}{
 nineteen forties only twenty-seven thousand <-_was><+_were> left to the Maasai and today even that twenty-seven per cent uh sorry twenty-seven thousand square kilometres <-_is><+_are> under dispute <#/>If you look at this thing a bit more closely in t
erms of the uh what is available for people you get this picture uh <#/>The purple border there is supposed to be the semi-arid area almost a half of the semi-arid areas and look at the amount of land that has gone into national parks uh into game control
l
ed areas and uh the large game parks like sorry the game reserves like the <name/> <#/>One thing which has still not been considered but which is fundamentally of importance in Tanzania still today are these tsetse areas including oddly enough even in the
 
part of the uh <-_>of the<-/> uh pastoral areas and this is where a lot of the problems with the Barbaig have occurred because in the past uh it meant clearing of the bush in order to uh get rid of the tsetse <#/>Now land should be looked into <#/>The <-/
>
the context of land ownership in Tanzania is based on number one customary rights which are user based <#/>The nineteen twenty-three ordinance as I said allowed a multiplicity of customs to <-/>to <-/>to be to <-/>to still be perpetuated but I think at th

 same time although we tend to treat customary rights as something uh uniform in fact that's not true at all <#/>By nine the nineteen forties land in certain parts of the country was already being sold it was being redistributed it could be owned communal
ly etcetera <#/>Two as I've already indicated right at the start }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{\b /}{\b\v tense}{\v  }{
there is this continuity of the dual system <#/>At Independence uh you might wonder why we're making such a big fuss about the state abolishing customary rights uh now wherea
s we didn't say anything at Independence because by then also the idea of state ownership began to come in <#/>What I'm trying to say is that both during the colonial period at Independence and at }{\b\v <+_article>}{
 present moment the idea of state ownership is there }{\b\v <&/>idiom}{
 implicitly <#/>It was first threatened in a major way by villagisation and I think now it's being threatened again by liberalisation and a factor which we have talked very little about I think also bothered by environmental factors including
 uh disease <#/>I'd like to elaborate on this by stating that customary land rights <#/>The origin of it is that uh there are modes of ownership which were based on entitlement <#/>There was no question in traditional society that there was a scarcity of 
i
t uh <#/>If there was a scarcity you moved you spread uh but uh everybody had a right to it and there were three modes of ownership one as a clan member two as an individual of the household three as a collective ownership of men and lastly there was also
 
a special dimension which uh was very important in terms of collective ownership of the pastoral people <#/>Now whether you belonged to one or the other or a combination of all of them depended on the political system of the tribe and the leadership of th
e
 clan the family <#/>For example among the <name/> it was the individual who decided to move into new areas and they allowed him because if he became successful he would have more people coming in and so settlements could be fairly large depending on the 
i
ndividual <#/>It would also depend on the scarcity or abundance of cultivated land and after the colonial period a great deal depended on the economic crops that were being grown <#/>As a result for example of economic crops both in Bukoba and in Kilimanj
aro uh land began to have a very serious market value <#/>For many reasons uh the British period did allow or it was imposed because it served the purpose of the state <#/>People became smallholder producers and it is in here }{\b\v <&/>idiom}{
 that I think there is
 a rather interesting development by the state until villagisation for example uh the government was <-/>was uh encouraging this this dual ownership because suddenly uh the state ownership <./>conp uh concept was not only reinforced in nineteen sixty-two 
b
ut it also allowed the state to pose as a developer <#/>And because it was failing to develop it decided to get involved with villagisation <#/>But there is another element too why the dual system uh was simply being tolerated in fact encouraged by the st
a
te and that is because it became a producer uh <#/>NALCO is Natural <O/> Company <#/>Millions were spent on it but it was it accounted for less than one per cent of the total national product despite spending millions into it and large tracts of land were
 actually taken away <#/>It became involved in food production NAFCO and of course all the problems that were associated with <O/> the sugar development etcetera <#/>It is in here }{\b\v <&/>idiom}{
 too uh that one must look at land use and state intervention <#/>Th
e state intervention business really started not in the drylands <#/>It started in areas of problems like the <name/> flood plains nineteen sixty-nine <#/>In nineteen seventy they decided to use the same techniques in other words civil servants deciding w
h
ere people should remain and what they should be doing and that was implemented in Dodoma in the villages and the Dodoma operation then became the operation for the whole country between nineteen seventy-three and nineteen seventy-five <#/>The results of 
t
hat were insecurity decline of productivity and a central control and a lack of participation in all the communities <#/>Now in the post-liberalisation period what we are beginning to see is the continuation of the breakdown of primary production systems 
l
oss of output unless it is externally generated <#/>For example uh the loss of <-/>of output in cashew nut production has been quite dramatic uh from a hundred and twenty-five thousand tons we are producing less than thirty thousand tons entirely because 
o
f villagisation because now the fields were very far away the trees were uh abandoned uh they caught on fire quite easily and so unless you have uh external inputs the chances of recovering are very very low <#/>There has been also a change of the type of
 
uh <-/> of uh <-/>of uh productivity demanded and that is for example you can produce a lot of cotton uh but if uh the markets and infrastructure is not there then I'm afraid that a people cannot really benefit <#/>In a liberalisation period too we're tal
k
ing about market forces but these have been so imperfect uh that uh we cannot rely too much on them and then lastly I think what liberalisation is bringing out very very strongly is centralisation versus the de-centralisation of uh <-/> of production <#/>
It's in here }{\b\v <&/>idiom}{
 that it is within this context of what I've said <#/>I'd like now to spend the rest of the time talking about the implication of Act Number Twenty-Two uh on the livelihood patterns <#/>Villagisation as I said was a major upheaval and 
it was not a question of land tenure but more a process of structures they created which were both contradictory in policy and in reality <#/>Now the Act is trying to legitimise these contradictions <#/>Number Two the contradictions in fact led to a great
 deal of corporisations of people <X_>}{\v 
For example there is now more and more emphasis put on the National Parks on grazing the land etcetera so that among the pastoralists although the pro capita numbers <-_has><+_have> declined one would say in the nineteen si

\par <I> <#/>Thank you very much <-/>oh <#/>Thank you ver
y much for uh inviting me to this seminar uh <#/>As you might uh see in the paper which I've just circulated uh uh I <./>do I think you're going to be scared by the slight change in the title <#/>The paper's entitled Interactional Features in Writing Disc
u
ssions of <O/> Writers and The Role of Imaginative Composition <#/>I think it's just a change of form rather than substance so I think it won't very much <O/> for after all I'm dwelling on exactly the same thing <#/>Now this paper is based on uh uh some r
e
search that I did for my uh doctorate but of course I just adapted part of it and the basic uh point was to look into the role of interactions on writing so I tried to look into how the various patterns of interaction may affect uh the <./>writ the politi
c
al writings in secondary schools <#/>Now I'll begin first of all with a general view of the developments in the time <#/>Now as is well known uh during the last two decades especially in the United States and Britain there has recently been an <./>int an 
i
nterest in trying to view writing not only as uh something that has got to be marked as something uh that is an end-product but as something which is involves both cognitive and social processes and therefore there is a reason a need for trying to study h
o
w collaboration among learners or collaboration between teachers and pupils on the one hand and between pupils and pupils themselves might enhance the process of learning <#/>Now this paper therefore is going to focus on the role of interaction in learnin
g
 first and then we will see how this discourse affected uh the writing <#/>I'll now <-/>I'll <-/>I'll first of all try to look into the discourse in learning <#/>Now communication in the classroom is seen as a gently and too shallow constructed activity <
#
/>However it's now evident from studies done that teachers are seen to monopolize the classroom talk <#/>As a matter of fact according to Flander's uh study Flander in nineteen seventy he's found that teachers talk most of the time seventy per cent of tea
c
hers' <./>utt of utterances in the classroom are found to be uh teachers' utterances and uh the classroom becomes a sort of a power arena where power is exercised by the leader of authority who in this case is the teacher <#/>Now this is seen very much of
 
course in the way the teacher allocates turns because in most cases the teacher allocates turns very rarely to pupils and that he does uh monopolize most of <./>th <-_>most of<-/> those turns <#/>Now in view of this it has been seen in some academic circl
e
s that uh group work could somehow help us towards uh uh creating an atmosphere which would probably lead to <O/> <#/>Let me <-_>let me<-/> now dwell a little bit on the role of pupil - pupil discourse <#/>How pupils could enhance their own learning throu
g
h their own discourse <#/>Now most of the literature on pupil - pupil discourse that is uh talk between pupils and pupils <-_have><+_has> tended to hinge on the official benefits <#/>Most American studies have hinged on the <-/>the official benefits which
 
derive for example it is assumed that uh if <-/> if learners interact among themselves they can be self-confident and they can also learn to trust each other <#/>However studies done in Britain have given group-work some sort of backing by regarding it as
 
a socio-cognitive dimension a socio-cognitive uh arena where students are able to exchange ideas where they are able to <O/> each other argue and therefore come up with something that is likely to enhance learning <#/>Now there is therefore a general cons
e
nsus that group interaction <-_lead><+_leads> to structured and modified comprehensible input measured through certain interactional features as clarification requests uh cognition checks comprehension checks and repetitions <#/>Now these interactional fe
a
tures later lead to language acquisition according to studies done by some of the authors uh whose references are cited in the paper <#/>Now there are a number of psychological and psycholinguistic studies that have been done to uh reinforce this point of
 
view chief among which are the works of uh <name/> and Piaget <#/>Now uh I don't want to deal at length here with this uh Piaget's theory for example of cognitive conflict presupposes that when learners are trying to perform a task together the fact that 
t
hey sometimes uh do not agree creates a situation where uh by reaching a consensus they're able to come out with some uh brighter and more articulate ideas <#/>Now <name/> on the other hand the Russian psychologist and linguist sees co-operation transacte
d
 between the learner and an adult the centre of interactions and that this subsequently leads to learning and uh <name/> however does see that uh the child before the child reaches a stage where he's able to solve his own problems he needs to interact wit
h
 others <#/>In other words here he says this is a point which he calls the learner proximal development <#/>On the other hand however the tasks which learners do do very much help to promote learning <#/>Now you have tasks for example the one-way-task uh 
<
-_task><+_tasks> which do not uh enable in us to interact among us or in solving problems may not seem to be well predisposed towards learning whereas tasks which enable learners to interact or to solve problems may <O/> to help promote learning <#/>There
f
ore tasks not only interaction but also tasks it's the nature of the task that they should learn in the classroom will help very much to promote a sort of uh interaction uh the sort of learning that is felt to be appropriate <#/>I will now dwell upon writ
i
ng on talk and see how talk as a base of interaction does could help literacy <#/>Now pupil talk has been perceived as contributing to uh you know promoting ideas before pupils are able to learn <#/>Now such work by people like Britten Graves and others h
a
ve added to this sort of conception <#/>Now some of these studies into the role of talk and writing have merely looked into interactional patterns of training teacher - student or student - student writing uh for example without stating for example how th
e
se teachers affected writing <#/>However there are a few studies which have been done and which have shown that uh when teachers I mean when students interact uh in other words when they offer each other requests and when they also engage in interactional
 
features such as uh confirmation and so on they're able to provide themselves with uh the language that they might probably use later to uh linguistic meaning and therefore be able to write something coherent <#/>Now uh in view of this therefore what were
 
the bases of the study <#/>Now this study was intended to look into the interaction of patterns which emerge once students are engaged in discussions about writing <#/>An attempt was made to determine which interactions lead to high quality discussions an
d
 which ones led to low quality discussions by relating them to compositions written after discussion <#/>In other words the study sought to examine whether or not the interactional features of the discussions have a bearing on the discourse and hence led 
t
o interactional features as products which means that uh basically I was trying to look into how these patterns of interaction which were likely to emerge as students were working together could help them write uh their compositions <#/>Now in so doing th
e
m uh I devised my research design this way <#/>I had a target sample of twenty-four high-ability average and low-ability pupils of secondary schools who were selected after an English cloze test had been administered <#/>Now the tasks which the students d
i
d were of two types <#/>Some of these tasks were teacher-fronted that is the task was conducted mainly or directed by the teacher and the other tasks were done in groups in pairs or various groups pair being two pupils and groups being made of six pupils 
<
#/>The tasks were involved descriptive compositions and active compositions <#/>Now if you look at the appendix which I provided because you'll find that uh there're two completely different compositions uh which were assigned <#/>One was the teacher-dire
c
ted composition and the other was uh a fundamentally different composition because of pair work <#/>Now if you look at the pictures you find that uh <#/>Have a look I don't know if you can <#/>Yeah the picture you have the pictures uh <#/>This is called <
.
/>teach teacher-fronted <./>com composition <#/>Have it there <#/>Okay <#/>So this was the teacher-fronted composition task that was <O/> by the teacher <#/>So the teacher had to describe something and then the teacher the pupils merely wrote something <#
/
>Then appendix b <-_>appendix b<-/> we have the instructions and the task follows <#/>This was the pair work where the pupils collaborated to do some work <#/>In other words they had pictures and they developed the topic of the pictures and then they trie
d to talk out </>am among themselves to see what comparison they could make of the picture <#/>You can see for example appendix b in this picture there are two pictures <#/>In one picture this <-/>this picture the picture above looks }{\b\v\lang2057 
<&/>lexeme}{\lang2057  to be somewh
at similar to the picture below appendix b but uh we can find that there are some objects which are missing in one of the pictures so that pupils had to talk and therefore this was seen as uh being able to promote some sort of talk I mean among <-/>among 
t
he pupils <#/>Now the other one was a narrative task <#/>This again was done was levied by the teacher and was also led uh by uh also done by the pupils themselves <#/>Now after the pupils when the pupils were working I <-/>I took some audiotaped transcri
p
ts <#/>So audiotapes <O/> related to the study are collected using a cassette recorder <#/>Now when the lesson ended what I did was I took the tapes of the conversation preceding the tasks and then I analysed the transcripts of the discourse that had take
n
 place between the teacher and the pupils and among the pupils themselves <#/>Now if a teacher did the coding of utterances and of the <O/> coding scheme was used <#/>Now how the <-/>the <-/>the operation coding scheme was worked you can see in appendix d
 
and e <#/>So I used appendix d and e to code the uh uh <-_>to code the<-/> interactions which took place while they were talking <#/>Then they I also coded the activities of listening reading and writing <#/>Now an additional coding scheme was designed to
 
observe the frequency of both teachers' and pupils' behaviour as they interacted during writing lessons <#/>Now talking listening reading and writing features were further divided into discourse acts which helped shape the interaction in the classroom <#/
>
Now some of the discourse acts uh are the ones which you can see in appendix f <#/>In other words uh these were somewhat based on pictures and therefore I tried to code the interaction for example if he's requesting if he's repeating or simply giving info
rmation <#/>So I tried to code the interactions on the left-hand side of the transcripts you know to find out what the students were trying what utterances the students were trying to make 
\par <X_>}{\v\lang2057 <$B>After c there's another page 
\par }{\b\v\lang2057 <&/>general talk and background noise}{\b\lang2057 </X>}{\b\v\lang2057 
\par }{\lang2057 
<#/>Now I'll dwell on the results of the study <#/>Now I processed the <-/>the data by you know when the transcripts had been written I <-/>I counted manually the frequency of these acts and later I went through the written compositions to see if the 
features noted in the verbal transcripts were observable in the original compositions and how these features could have been probably uh could have helped to convey information which was uh put by the students in their compositions <#/>I took a sample of 
t
welve subjects uh <#/>These were six good performers and six bad performers <#/>Now the results of the study <#/>Now the results of the study indicated that uh the teacher's requests for students to clarify content or language form involved pupils merely 
c
ompleting teacher's utterances in that they are restating what the teacher had said <#/>In other words what I found was that uh if you look at the transcripts of the students uh which are provided in uh in one of these if you look at this sheet of paper w
hich has got uh twenty-one that's page twenty-one <#/>You have the interaction of the students <#/>For example it does compare here <#/>I don't know if you have this
\par <X_>}{\v\lang2057 <$B> <#/>twenty-one}{\lang2057 </X>
\par <#/>Twenty-one of this small sheet of paper this one <#/>Good <#/>Now w
hat I found out what we found out is that uh in this transcript you have the students trying to exchange ideas about something they are doing and now what we see is that the students are merely repeating the teacher's utterances and that what transpires l
ater as they write their composition }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_is>}{\v\lang2057  }{\lang2057 that they merely repeat what they have been actually what they've been saying in the in their discussions <X_>}{\v\lang2057 
Now what <-/>what actually this reveals is that uh students generally tend to be unaware of the differences
 between uh the spoken mode and the written mode And therefore it's in view of that that they're not very <-_>they're not very<-/> competent in being able to write something uh in line with the conventions of uh of written discourse Now another observatio
n
 in six two six point two on page four you'll find that requesting explanation of content or form and the repetition seems to have been a common feature of both the high performers and the low performers with the repetitions of content being prominently a
 
feature of the finished composition Now the nature of request for example as a discourse act varied Request for clarification led to high level talk while the request for explanation did not Now this would be due to the fact that when requesting clarifica
t
ion for example one is likely to learn new words or structures While a request for explanation may not necessarily lead to uh a <O/> explanation Now what I mean is that uh as students are you know are requesting for explanation the student the other stude
n
t may be able to provide an explanation but this explanation did not necessarily lead to high quality of talk in the sense that what the student uh <-_provide><+_provides> as explanation may not be helpful in making the student write properly Another obse
r
vation six three point six three on <./>pa on page five was as regards the organization of the work itself of group work What I found was that the group work which involved six students sitting together afforded students better opportunities to expand on 
t
heir statements to incorporate new ideas and subsequently to <-/>to incorporate them in their writing themselves Now this might show that uh probably group work is more ideal than pair work but possibly in view of the fact that when you're pairing two stu
dents both of whom are not competent in the language they may not be able to sustain the conversation }{\b\v\lang2057 <&/>background noise}{\v\lang2057 
 whereas if you're pairing students in a group there is a possibility of these students at least two or three of them being able to be 
competent enough Not all of them will be incompetent Now the impact of this on written composition is that the <-_composition><+_compositions> which were written generally uh reveal that the factors of interaction which the students displayed in their dis
c
ussions were also discernible or were seen in their compositions However this interaction factor did not seem to have to result in good compositions In other words although they interacted it was not really clear to see if the interactions did in a way he
l
p the students very much And I think this is uh primarily because of the pupils' failure to differentiate for example between spoken language or spoken discourse and written discourse Now this can be seen in an appendix if you look at the percentage of ut
terances in these charts They've got these uh shall I call them bar graphs or }{\b\v\lang2057 <&/>laughs}{\v\lang2057 
 You have these <-_>you have these<-/> the graphs which represent the discourse acts which the students engaged in uh Sorry you'll have to share You know these graphs Ye
ah that's it You have one figured you have figure one two three and four Figures one two three and four <-_Figure><+_Figures> one two three and four <-_shows><+_show> the interaction that took place in teacher-led discussions one and two teacher-led discu
s
sions whereas three and four <-_shows><+_show> the interactions which took place in student-led discussions Now the symbols uh have been described uh have been explained there GIC for example means giving information on content EV means evaluating <O/> sp
e
culating and reasoning and therefore you'll find that the <-/>the <-_>that the<-/> sort of interaction that the students engaged in merely involved mostly giving information and did not in any way lead to uh high-quality discussions In other words they fa
i
led to engage in uh <-/>in such uh interactional patterns as reasoning or speculating or clarifying which could have uh probably helped them when they went on to write their compositions Now what then are the implications of this study Now from this I cou
l
d tell that the implications of this study that teachers need to be careful in assigning tasks which engage learners in <./>explora <-_>in exploratory talk In other words uh they should be able to design tasks that will anyway sustain discussion make the 
s
tudents talk and not merely tasks that will probably make them think or tasks which will uh hinder them from being able to exchange ideas with their friends Secondly the implication of the study is that secondary school pupils should not be regarded as ha
v
ing nothing to contribute to one another because of lack of proficiency in English In other words there is a tendency for most of the teachers to regard these students as I mean they are incompetent in the language and the they take it for granted that th
e
se cannot interact in learning because after all they have got a lot of lexical and grammatical errors which they could learn from each other and therefore they have nothing to contribute to each other Now third <-/>third thirdly I think there is a need t
o
 look into the whole pattern of you know arranging students' work In other words there is <-_>there is<-/> currently the desire to making students learn together We've had this for a long time But then what we found out is that there is a need for example
 
to decide how to <-/>to arrange students together how to pair them together on the basis of ability Should we pair them in yeah should we put them into groups of two students who are equally competent in pairs or should we mix them up in groups with other
s
 who are a little bit more uh I mean more fairly competent Then finally the implication of this study is that syllabus designers need to structure learning and write books that promote both talking and writing skills In other words uh here I think we have
 
to go back to the communicative aspect the nature of function of all sort of activities uh which have been suggested by <name/> and others in the sense that uh probably some of these activities could in a way promote <./>acti uh <-/>promote sort of intera
ction among pupils than <&/>}{\b\v\lang2057 grammar}{\v\lang2057  the tasks which we simply I mean are assigned by merely writing a topic on the blackboard and letting students learn }{\lang2057 </X></I>

there is growing interest in the language of political leadership among linguists and uh in this we may quote Atkinson nineteen eighty-four <#/><name/> Atkinson discusses Reagan Thatcher Kinnock Martin Luther King and he goes back actually to Hitler Lenin
 
and so on <name/> discussing the political leadership styles in the US nineteen eighty-seven <#/>And Wilson nineteen ninety uh attempts what he calls political leadership uh styles uh you know political speaking politically speaking in western settings an
d
 of course there you know is <-/>is more recent work by Daphne and Kolinsky on uh <./>leader leadership uh political leadership styles in terms of language styles of course language speaking styles oratory styles <#/>Of course in the UK West Germany then 
a
nd <-/>and <-/>and France uh in much of the work the interest has arisen or has coincided with the major global socio-political changes that have taken place since the oil crisis nineteen seventy-three uh which culminated in the assumption of political le

dership by strong and highly personalized political figures in several countries in Western Europe for example Thatcher in the UK Mr <-/>Mr Mitterrand in France and in North America Mr Reagan and the <-/>the <-/>the impact of these personalities <O/> espe
c
ially in terms of western scholarship as occasioning this interest among linguists uh <#/>Here in <-/>in Africa in the shadow of these political changes uh we at least in Tanzania have witnessed also we have also witnessed major personnel changes especial

<+_article>}{\lang2057  technical process though of course requiring }{\b\v\lang2057 <+_article>}{\lang2057  supportive political environment and I'm sure those of you who attend conferences maybe every now and again on market-oriented performance they }{
\b\v\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\lang2057  hear this word political environment a lot so <-/>so that
 development is principally a technical process a process that economists know better how to enter not politicians but at the same time politicians are needed to create the <?/>inappropriate political climate in which these technical people could perform 
t
heir <-/>their duties <#/>So it is that sort of background I mean which has occasioned you can see uh on <-/>on <-/on> the handout which is the number the page number one ninety uh which has occasioned the kind of concerns that we thought uh and still bel

do as you can see there about five we've selected variation uh you know in the deployment of the following language forms for instance <./>proprosody features which affect pausing intonation subordination and some human behaviour like laughing <#/>We <-/>
w
e thought you know those could merit you know investigation by linguists by a linguist and then also syntactic devices like the use of existential and passive clauses which help in the staging of message chunks <#/>Existential uh clauses would be for thos

 who are not linguists I see uh uh clauses that have been introduced by there <-/>there are for instance <#/>There are those who etcetera <#/>There are those who you know where you know uh you know that would be along the same sort of lines as uh you know

r
e you'd have passified and left out I eat food or people eat food and then the vocabulary choices resulting in the nouns versus verbs ratio <./>character characterising human message chunks where you know as uh Halliday Michael Halliday in the nineteen ei

<#/>there will always be a difference between the spoken and written language not usually a clear distinction between two different languages although this can happen and used to be common enough uh <#/>Nowadays the two are generally closer together and w

\par <#/>Okay <#/>You know Halliday went with others to suggest that uh written discourse would be characterised by a

ning which is of relevance to a linguist you see <#/>And then uh number five pronominal selection which manipulate which is manipulated to realise face management or politeness pronominal selection <#/>Here we mean the use of pronouns like I or we or he o
r they and so on okay which are <-_>which are<-/> in a such selection }{\b\v\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\lang2057 
 as is manipulated to create either you know to reduce the extent to which people's faces are threatened in a negative or positive way I mean in the sense for instance if I wan
t to order villagers and I'm a president to put manure into their farms I might say We have to put manure in our farms although I don't have a farm actually I'm just telling them to do it you see but I'm reducing the extent of distance between myself and 
t
hem by including myself in the people who are going to put manure in the farms <#/>So the use of we uh you know is manipulative and then these dimensions we suggest they're you know you know that these dimensions along with the use of linguistic forms tha
t vary would include the speech mode dimension <#/>For example the style of speech delivery would vary according to whether the speech was scripted or unscripted again bringing in }{\b\v\lang2057 <&/>background noise}{\v\lang2057  }{\lang2057 
<-_>again bringing in<-/> the idea you know <O/> by Hall
iday of speech versus you know written versus spoken discourse okay <#/>The study showed that the scripted the study by <name/> nineteen ninety-two shows that the scripted versus unscripted distinction tended to mirror the extent to which features that ty
p
ify written discourse are <./>deplayed deployed in the given spoken texts scripted oratory deploying more written discourse features than unscripted oratory irrespective of the speaker and I mean and you know we want to suggest that you know much as we mi
g
ht notice a lot of substance <./>dist differences between Nyerere and Mwinyi there are certain stylistic features that <-/>that they share <#/>And then the audience dimension <./>distinct the audience design dimension uh which is to say the influence whic
h
 is exerted on the speaker by the socio-political profiles of the participants of the speech event for example whether the audience consists of village peasants senior political senior national political leaders or a mixture of peasants workers and politi
c
ians you know who we usually call the mass you know <#/>This audience design dimension influencing the you know the style is neatly shown in the work that uh my colleague <name/> has done uh on you know say <-/>on parliamentary language where code switchi
ng you know which is done there more <-/>more often than it would be done by the same politicians if they are speaking }{\b\v\lang2057 <&/>grammar/tense}{\v\lang2057  }{\lang2057 
to a village audience or you know uh when especially in the past when say Julius Nyerere as the president would go out to the regions he will call }{\b\v\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\b\lang2057 /}{\b\v\lang2057 tense}{\lang2057  he will speak }{\b\v\lang2057

 more English there more code switching into English <#/>And when we go to a public audience a public square you know we red
uce the extent to which we code switch into English again you know showing that the audience design you know the people you are addressing influence the kind of language you might use <#/>The finally the physical dimension where you know indirect influenc
e
 is exerted on your speech delivery by factors such as whether the speech is delivered in an assembly hall uh in an open field in a village in a town football stadium or a city square <#/>Okay all these are factors that definitely might uh might <-/>influ
e
nce the language the style that is <#/>Now uh very quickly maybe it will not be possible to go through all the sort of observations we've arrived at I will uh quickly go through some of the observations that are striking you know deriving from the work by
 
<name/> ninety ninety-two on the on what he has called Tanzanian political <./>Ki uh Tanzanian political Kiswahili uh Tanzanian presidential <-_>Tanzanian presidential<-/> Kiswahili political oratory where you know it's looking at the language of presiden
t
s when they give speeches <#/>Now a number of observations you know have been you know found and the most telling you know are the following okay uh <#/>One can make a series of points relating to the <./>inter <O/> speakers' variation within the presiden
t
ial speeches in Tanzania <#/>Firstly Julius Nyerere whose style of speech ever <-_tend><+_tends> to be bookish <#/>Julius Nyerere's style tended to be bookish and bombastic was also one we incontestably qualified as the foremost ideology builder you know 
a
nd <-/>and therefore this is uh contrasted in terms of the observation with Ali Hassan Mwinyi whose speeches whose style is analysable as colloquial and now I'm using the word colloquial very carefully as it is used by <-/>by <name/> to mean that it is le
s
s bookish in a positive sense actually uh right and <O/> that is used by <name/> tended to play more the role of an ideology player and less that of an ideology builder okay and a very good example in terms of vocabulary for instance would be Mwinyi's use
 
of <#/>He interpreted phrases <#/>You know Mwinyi tended to interpret the collocative meaning range of ideologically important nominal expressions such as <ea/><O/> for instance in <-/>in you know <name/> okay or <ea/></O> and you find <ea/> is an express
i
on for capitalist in <name/> <#/>When he uses the word <ea/><O/> in <O/> where he uses <ea/><O/> for <O/> <#/>One sort of <ea/><O/> does not translate incontestably into <-/>into <ea/><O/> you know <#/>He's casting negative connotations <#/>But Mwinyi on 
t
he other hand has sought to reinterpret the terms <O/> for instance to mean you know being assertive you know and as a manager ever knowing what you are doing etcetera <#/>And also indeed actually you find <O/> Mwinyi <#/>In nineteen ninety-one I think sp
e
ech to elders of Dar es Salaam which was itself actually a bit of a problem because you know I mean it was built as a speech to elders of Dar es Salaam but actually it was organised by the businessmen and he used the occasion to reinterpret the meaning of
 
businessman to say that you know there are three categories of Tanzanian not just two you know <ea/<O/> but you'll also find <ea/><O/> where previously <ea/><O/> was interpreted to mean you know a category a subcategory of <O/> you know meaning you know a
 worker in the private sector you see <ea/><O/>
\par <#/>So now you know obviously in a way since these are terms defined clearly in <-/>in documents that he would himself actually owe allegiance to or at least owe legitimacy to then it would seem that Mwinyi wa
s in a way uh you know blurring the meaning the sort of distinction range you know and encouraging a more liberal laissez-faire you know attitude towards these documents as well as their definitions okay <#/>And very quickly you know in <-/>in terms of id
e
ology builder like Julius Nyerere uh we would say that he tended to use laughter and other prosodic features to humour his strictures against fellow political leaders whom he tended to harangue more than to lecture <#/>And I think we have an example there
 of Julius Nyerere there on the <-_>on the<-/> handout with the page one four seven <#/>There he says <ea_>}{\b\v\lang2057 sentence}{\lang2057 <ea/> humour there okay audience laughs <ea_>}{\b\v\lang2057 sentence}{\lang2057 <ea/> }{\b\v\lang2057 
<&/>laughter}{\lang2057  because obviously he's playing on humour I mean and there is a whole range of activities about humour <ea_>}{\b\v\lang2057 sentence}{\lang2057 
<ea/> and yet while he was saying <ea/><O/> this was some time later in the speech it can be added that the issue wasn't picked up by the media <#/>He was encouraging the media to pick up what he was saying <#/>This is why he kept turning to it again and 
again one of sacking corrupt co-operative union bosses some of whom were with him on the speech platform because this was a speech he was giving for <name/> day in <name/> and you know I remember you know <name/> was there <O_>}{\b\v\lang2057 sentence}{
\lang2057 <O/> and he kept refer
ring to him you know I mean and one can and he wasn't the president then actually he was only the chairman so one can imagine he was trying to push them to do something using their speech but you know couching such you know <-/>such strictures in humorous
 
text so as you know not to offend some kind of uh face management you know device and he's very good at that <#/>Again and again there are many examples when he would you know he would want for instance say things which are you know like I mean once for i
n
stance he was giving a speech in Dodoma <#/>This is after the conference in nineteen eighty-six where Mwinyi in December said a number of things needed to be changed and there's <name/> in eighty-seven giving a speech celebrating twenty years of <O/> Arus
h
a he then started by saying you know I too think there must be a few changes in <name/> and everybody clapped even those on the platform including the president of course Ali Hassan Mwinyi okay <#/>And then he followed that you know by saying you'd be ama
zed at the kind of things I'm going to suggest ought to be changed and then following that by saying we needed to have a bit of editing to remove things reference to TANU CCM <name/> }{\b\v\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\lang2057 
 which obviously having I mean he was telling <#/>Because Ali 
Hassan Mwinyi's speech had been prominently put in the papers you know which he gave to a conference <#/>So oh yes you can't tell me as a linguist analysing you know calmly <name/> wasn't trying to say no move away from this idea of change although we kno
w
 subsequently of course there was the Zanzibar change okay <#/>So perhaps maybe people are going to wish to discuss and my colleague here has agreed to <-/>to chip in at the end maybe <#/>I will say one more thing about Ali Hassan Mwinyi so that you can s
e
e the contrast uh <#/>President Mwinyi tends to use involvement markers such as the use of hearer inclusive we the first person <-_singular><+_plural> pronoun and the use of a greater proportion of verbs than nouns to construct the message chunks <#/>His 
s
peech style is in perfect accord with the trends towards ideology <?/>bearing which seems to have gradually become a distinct characteristic of the political disposition of the Tanzanian government ever since the acute economy crisis of the seventies forc
ed it to accept them and with strictures <X_>}{\v\lang2057 
<#/>It is perhaps relevant to discuss uh to point out okay that uh this tendency on the part of Mwinyi itself is a <-_>is a<-/> tendency which characterises also a lot of the speeches of politicians like Thatcher and
 Reagan and Mitterrand to some extent the use of hearer inclusive we etcetera and projecting an image of uh <-/>of all-inclusiveness of a fireside chat of being all together of blurring power relationships so if you see if you you know you are listening t
o
 a speech say of a president you may in this particular kind of style be made to believe you are equal and obviously you are not <#/>So the outcome is that there are who have suggested that this is a sort of synthetic democratisation y<-/>synthetic <-/>sy
n
thetic <-/>democratization <#/>Synthetic in the sense that it is not genuine to blur again yet again to blur power <-/>power relationships power from a distance <#/>That might work in a situation where you are thinking in terms of a small government gover
n
ment which only is just as hopeless as everybody else and you know can't be expected to do a lot of things etcetera etcetera as n outlook not you know not created not popularized not necessarily caused by a particular leader say Ali Hassan Mwinyi but rath
e
r by the times <-_>by the times<-/> <#/>As for Julius Nyerere there are <-_<there are<-/> certain parts certain areas in his style which seem to <./>coin to be sort of similar to the sort of style one would associate with senior academic senior lecturing 
b
y those in academia who are insurrectionary if you like who are seeking to undermine existing perceived wisdom okay <#/>And you know a study by Alfred Marshall an economist who uh he uh you know those who study economics obviously know Marshall he's a fam
ous you know nineteenth century early twentieth century economist <#/>A study of Marshall's lecturing style has this to say }{\b\v\lang2057 <&/>quote}{\v\lang2057 
 <#/>Marshall's eyes lit up now talking easily now chuckling over some story now questioning his class now pausing impressiv
ely with rapt expression his eyes in the far corner of the room now speaking his solemn prophetic tones of some problem of the future <#/>Humour played an important part in his lectures <#/>He had good stories <#/>No one enjoyed their fun more than himsel
f
 meaning he obviously laughed <#/>Now one would not have thought that a lecturer would do that but I suspect Professor Marshall adopted that kind of style in the later part of his academic career when he began to question a lot of the wisdom he himself ha
d
 actually uh you know helped to <-/>to become received wisdom okay <#/>So what I'm saying uh all we're saying is that the idea of an ideology by someone seeking to push a particular ideology and set it up as distinct from all others okay being associated 
w
ith something bookish and at the same time <O/> that bookishness with being <O/> would seem to be ironic you know but that <-/>that is indeed what is being found <#/>On the other hand the idea of a president who encourages collective leadership listens to
 everything you know and so on and also being more using more verbs making more distinctions and you know as you can see from example the example there on page one you know the one one ten one ten that is Mwinyi there saying <ea_>}{\b\v\lang2057 sentence}
{\v\lang2057 <ea/> <#/>This is a
 speech Ali Hassan Mwinyi President Ali Hassan Mwinyi gave on the occasion of ex-President Nyerere getting the Lenin prize you know ironically uh getting the Lenin prize and here sort of you know President Mwinyi was giving an eulogy you know praise of th
e president and he says <ea_>}{\b\v\lang2057 sentences}{\v\lang2057 <ea/> <#/>You see and you can see you know the avoidance of uh using adjectives there in describing things you know using things <ea_>}{\b\v\lang2057 words}{\v\lang2057 
<ea/> <#/>This is a trait which seeks to describe activities rather than to use 
adjectives and so <#/>So I'm saying you know those are <-/>are the kinds of points you come up with and obviously we could go on but we've agreed that we'd say little and then in the cause of your the discussion my colleague will also chip in bring in som

\par <I> <#/>My understanding of uh what the <name/> co
mmission has done or has said insofar as civil organisations are concerned <#/>There are there is one or two points which I thought are preliminary points which I thought I should make before I go looking at the particular aspects <#/>The first one is tha
t
 I was actually very much impressed uh by the thoroughness of the report which was prepared by this particular commission <#/>But after going through the <-/>the book <-/>book one okay I started wondering whether or in that particular in their <-_>in thei
r
<-/> zeal the commissioners had whether the commissioners in their zeal had not actually exceeded uh their <-/>their limits which were set out in the terms of reference <#/>For instance my impression was that the commissioners actually attempted to either
 
rewrite a history on <./>poli party on party politics or at least they have given an honest impression or honest <O/> of party politics and I say this particularly as regards the history of CCM <#/>I have been educated in here from primary school up to th
e
 university level and I remember in primary education and secondary education when it came to teaching us about the history of party politics they usually started with Tanganyika African Association uh <#/>In this report I was delighted to find that at le
a
st they have gone a step back and looking at African Associations which in other words simply emphasises the fact that the political parties which came to be formed in our country had started or had their beginnings in civil organisations as such <#/>Afri
c
an Association was a civil organisation and it answered all the <#/>It had all the necessary elements which distinguish it as a civil organisation and it is from this particular organisation African Association that we have uh political parties such as KA
N
U coming into existence <#/>It is actually a progenitor to this particular party KANU and also it is a progenitor to the <name/> party of Zanzibar <#/>This is something which comes out quite clearly in the report and it shows quite clearly that civil orga
n
isations are quite important <#/>That is the first thing which impressed me insofar as the historical aspect of this particular report is concerned <#/>I The <-/>the second thing which I should make as a preliminary observation is actually a point which c
omes out in almost all report writings <#/>In almost all report writings the people who are set <-/>set out to write that particular report after collecting various data collecting data and all that when it comes to writing and the }{\b\lang2057 <-_>}{
\b\v\lang2057 several words}{\b\lang2057 <-/>}{\lang2057  it 
is very difficult to avoid putting out their views instead of those which were supposed to be uh which were actually given by the people <#/>Now in this <-_>in this<-/> regard what I'm saying is that what is stated in this particular report is not confine
d
 merely to systematisation of the views and points which were given by the people generally but actually I can detect that it reflects the report itself reflects the views which were held by the commissioners <#/>Well I'm not saying that this is a bad thi
n
g only that I'm saying that here we are where we are supposed to write to systematise <#/>I mean the report the whole intention was actually of the commission was simply to systematise the views and opinions of the people concerning whether they want to h
a
ve one party or multi-party and how to widen democracy in our country but I fear that what has come out is more than that only that in this particular aspect the commissioners may have had held these particular views whether they were actually expressed b
y
 the people or not <#/>As I have noted that this is not a bad thing only that it is a reflection of what we <-/>we have <#/>This is even more prominent in cases of politics that is politicians will not want to put up a suggestion <#/>They will normally sa
y
 that the people say this and that but actually they are the ones who are saying it uh <#/>I'm interested in part three of the fourth term of reference which in my uh independent interpretation the report is written in Kiswahili at least the first book uh
 
and the second is written in Kiswahili except for the third which concerns law <#/>That one is written in English as usual uh <#/>In the first part I'm interested in the fourth term of reference which is discussed in detail in book one <#/>This part talke
d
 about the purpose of <O/> <-/>term of reference is that the commission was required to suggest ways in which democracy could be increased <#/>And also the commission was supposed to <-/>to suggest ways in which they could instil either what is known as a
 
political culture or democratic culture in the country irrespective of the form of government <-_>the form of government<-/> which is meant to be suggested by that particular politic by <-/>by the commission <#/>In other words the commission was required 
t
o give suggestions on how the democracy could be increased <#/>Okay they <#/>It is an admission that it was novel that democracy was a little bit uh restricted did not not altogether not existing and the commission was required to suggest ways in which th
i
s particular democracy could be increased in our country and also the purpose <#/>I mean another thing which was supposed to be presented or to be suggested by the commission was actually instilling what I fail to get the proper word but it's either polit
i
cal culture or democratic culture into the society how this is going to be instilled in the society <#/>Now it is upon this that the element of civil organisations comes into play <#/>It has been noted <#/>It has been stated in various parts of this parti
c
ular report that and actually the my colleagues who have <O/> earlier on that is the day before yesterday have actually stated quite clearly that democracy is not assured by simply having several parties political parties <#/>Political parties alone canno
t
 ensure that there is democracy <#/>Now in realisation of that particular fact then the commissioners in my understanding of this particular report were required to look into ways of either strengthening or instilling that particular democratic culture in
t
o our country <#/>That aspect as I have noted earlier on is <-/>is asked on page from page fifteen on of the first book that is part two of their report <#/>This report deals with aspects <#/>I mean the <-/>the this particular report deals with <./>asp th
i
s particular aspect that is of civil organisation s and it is titled again in my interpretation political situation before and after independence <#/>Obviously there are some other parts which are discussing this particular element of civil organisations 
b
ut in the main the historical aspect or the historical part is discussed in this uh <-_>in this<-/> particular part that is from page fifteen onwards of the first book <#/>The first thing which comes out quite clearly is that the <-/>the report tries to l
o
ok at three things <#/>Okay <#/>It tries to answer three basic things <#/>That is why when and how these organisations came into being <#/>Okay there 's particular civil organisations in plus political organisations came into being and here as I have said
 
they discuss the origins of political parties and they note quite clearly that they had their beginnings in civil organisations <#/>I don't think I have to go into the details of what was stated in there but there are some features which are quite importa
n
t and they come out quite clear in that particular report <#/>The first one was that it is the circumstances existing at that particular time for instance in nineteen twenties up to nineteen thirties the economic hardships okay which brought together the 
p
eople various people who felt the need to establish civil organisations <#/>It is the circumstances which were obtaining at the particular time which compelled the people to form civil organisations <#/>The second thing which is quite important is the spo
n
taneity of these particular organisations <#/>No one came to tell the people that you should form organisations <#/>They felt the need <#/>They organised themselves and they organised themselves on the lines of that particular need <#/>Okay here's a group
 
of people who had a problem a common problem <#/>And they thought that if they wanted to resolve that particular problem or at least to mitigate its effects then they had to come together and establish something which will reflect their interests <#/>You 
s
ee <#/>Now the element of spontaneity is quite important in the sense that we have organisations which start at the grassroots <-_>at the grassroots<-/> level instead of having organisations that started at the top as is quite fashionable right now <#/>We
 
have organisations which have started at the top and they're supposed to cater for the needs of the people with definitely uh failure which is quite evident <#/>This is the second thing which was is quite important which comes out of that particular histo
r
ical analysis <#/>And then there is a third thing which is also important <#/>And this is one is the problem of putting demarcation between the roles objectives aims and goals of civil organisations and political activities <#/>I mean it's very difficult 
t
o put a very clear demarcation between the aims objectives and goals of civil organisations and political goals <#/>Now this had two-fold effect <#/>The first one is that it led the governments whatever whether it's colonial or the independent governments
 
to actually try and either control or suppress these civil organisations <#/>The lack of demarcation the <-/>the fact that the aims of these civil organisations however they were defined or whatever their aims or goals were meant that in the final analysi
s
 they came to be interpreted as political goals <#/>The lack of definition or the lack of demarcation between these two definitely meant that these organisations uh were actually a subject of either separation by the governments both the colonial and inde
p
endent governments or at least </O> try and control them <#/>This is something which comes out quite clearly in this particular report <#/>Now the colonial government had various had started actually they had simply started and this came to be done even w
i
th more efficiency by the independent government and trying to control this they used mainly two ways <#/>First by enacting <-_legislations><+_legislation> passing legislation pieces of legislation which could at least either suppress or control the parti
c
ular these civil organisations or in cases of Zanzibar for instance there was outright force in eliminating these uh civil organisations <#/>The statutes which are discussed in this particular report which were used by the colonial government and later on
 
adopted and modified and even perfected one could say by the uh <-/>the independent government include such <-_legislations><+_legislation> as trade unions ordinance co-operative ordinance and co-operative various co-operatives acts which were passed by i
n
dependent governments uh the trade unions' ordinance society's ordinance and the rest <#/>I mean there are quite a number of statutes which are discussed by this particular report and they all show one thing that is they either want to suppress the <-/>th
e
 <-/>the civil organisations at least if they can be if they cannot be suppressed altogether then they are aimed at being eliminated by <-/>by the <-_>by the<-/> governments in power <#/>The reasons why these uh <./>soc the civil organisations were actual
l
y particularly those which had goals which <./>tend tended <-/>tended to interfere or which had very little demarcation between politics and their <-/>their objectives was the fact that these political these civil organisations tended to threaten the gove
r
nments in power an this was something which could not be accepted by these governments and therefore they tended to want to suppress them as I have noted <#/>Now there are a number of things which emerged particularly after independence <#/>There are a nu
m
ber of trends actually which emerged after independence uh which are quite important and they are <./>determ and they are discussed quite at length in this particular report <#/>The first one which is quite pervasive in its <-_>in its<-/> influence is the
 doctrine of white supremacy <#/>}{The fact that the party wanted to assume the powers of discussing all issues or dealing with all issues which arise and all matters which had to be discussed by the people had to be done under the umbrella of the party }
{\lang2057 <#/>}{I
 believe the this is something which was discussed quite at length by my colleagues the day before yesterday so I won't go into the details of that particular element but it's important to note that it is very difficult and this something which was realis
ed then and it has actually been pointed out quite clearly by the <-_>by the<-/>report that one political party or so many political parties cannot effectively represent the interest of various people }{\lang2057 <#/>}{I'll give just one example uh }{
\lang2057 <#/>}{People in <name/> area are terrorised and actually they are being harassed out of existence by lions but then there are people here in Dar es Salaam mainly and Arusha who say that lions are quite important as a tourist attraction }{
\lang2057 <#/>}{Therefore if one organisation wants to r
epresent the interest of the people of <name/> and at the same time they want to represent the interests of people who are living in Dar es Salaam and who view the lions as uh an important inheritance or heritage which needs to be preserved for the future
 generation then we'll definitely have problems }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
And secondly the fact that these people are talking about they may be talking about lions that element can also develop into I mean the intention in putting forward their views they will definitely want to
 put and come up with a policy and once they want to put up the policy then they'll definitely fall in the domain of politics and in that case the difference between the mere aspect of looking at lions will turn into a political issue and the demarcation 
between a pressure group which wants to either to eliminate lions or to preserve the lions become }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ a political issue and as such each wants to be dominated by the <-_>by the<_/> political party }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
That is one thing which comes out quite clearly 
in this particular report that one political party or even so many political parties cannot represent the interests of so many people who have diverging interests and they want to put them in a different way or to express them in very different ways and m
anners }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
Now if only one political party or several political parties for that matter want to have a monopoly of this particular business of talking or representing the interests of various groups in the society then uh definitely democracy is being snuffed out }{
\lang2057 <#/>}{
The other element which uh is quite responsible which a trend which has been shown which was quite unfavourable to the development of serious or very serious civil organisations is are the policies various policies which are enunciated by the pa
rty particularly the policies of what is known as developmentism }{\lang2057 <#/>}{These are the policies which were enunciated particularly with uh much vigour from nineteen sixty-one up to nineteen sixty-seven }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
Now the policies of developmentism had one effect in that they tried to interfere into almost every sphere }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
Now if these particular policies are coupled with the <-/>the party supremacy then we have the government wanting to put its finger into almost everything uh in such a way the civil organisations are actually snuffed out }{\lang2057 <#/>}{
There <-/>there are very good examples here insofar as these policies of developmentism are concerned and this is the relationship between the government and <O/> federation of labour for instance something which is discussed quit
e at length in part two of this report }{\lang2057 <#/>}{And also there is relationship between the government the party and the government and <_/>comparatives><+_co-operatives> <X_>}{\v 
Okay this is also discussed quite at length insofar as this particular report is concerned 
The other element which <-/>which is also the which also comes out quite clearly in this particular report is the fact that these the elements the <-/>the <-/>the fact that the party has assumed all the powers to talk for the people instead of I mean to t
a
lk for the people representing all their interests has actually had such a pervasive influence that even after the party had started releasing some of these particular powers had started actually allowing some organisation for <-/>for particularly co-oper
a
tive societies and the pace at which they have been accepted back has been actually very slow And the <-/>the commission notes that this is something which was to be expected because after a long period of time where people have been working under control
 
then leaving them I mean leaving that particular control then it will take time before people really recognise and appreciate the fact that they are now free to form their own free co-operatives and as such they can go ahead and do whatever they want Mayb
e
 I should talk only about I mean we should concentrate I see I have already used more than twenty minutes I think I should talk about the statives which have been discussed in this which directly relate to the civil organisations The first thing is the co
n
stitution Article twenty of the constitution provides for this necessary freedom of association I believe this is something which had also been covered by my colleagues uh last <-/>last I mean the day before uh <-_>the day before<-/> yesterday and I don't
 
have to think I don't have to waste time on that But there are other statutes which are quite important apart from that basic law that is article twenty or section twenty of our constitution There is for instance this notorious statute society's ordinance
 
Okay this is discussed uh in this particular commission I mean in this particular report and it appears in section in part three on page forty-four Now what interested me is that the <-/>the commission recommends puts up a general recommendation Okay afte
r
 discussing some of the provisions of which are actually hindering the freedom of organisation of these I mean the civil organisations and showing that this particular statute is particularly bad insofar as it hinders civil people to organise themselves <
&/>}{\b\v grammar}{\v 
 <-_It's><+_It> merely says that that particular ordinance I mean that particular ordinance ought to be amended for instance but then I thought it should have gone farther and stipulate very frankly that uh society's ordinance as it is a bad thing
 and therefore what we need is simply a register okay whereby these various organisations which are formed should be registered just like the register of births and deaths I mean a person when he's born he's supposed to be registered but then the <./>regi
 
<-/>the person who registers you doesn't have any control in your life right And what we would need is actually such a thing Instead of having a law which will stipulate that if you do this then the society's abolished and so on and so forth That can be l
e
ft up to the general laws Rather what is supposed to be done is to have a very simple statute and a very simple institution which is simply supposed to record this existence of these <./>commis I mean civil organisations I thought that one would have been
 
a little better than uh the <-/>the <-/>the having anything which is in the lines of this particular statute Instead of having some very few cosmetic changes to this particular statute we should have actually a very simple statute which simply seeks to re
c
ord the number of these civil organisations in whatever form they may <-_>they may<-/> <-_>they may<-/> take The second statute which is discussed in this <./>ord uh in this report is trade unions ordinance You will note that even in the part three of thi
s
 particular report the discussion on trade unions occupies a very small portion And I was also surprised by this fact simply because the statute is actually superfluous whether with or without amendments Now that we have the organisation <name/> for insta
n
ce and all those trade unions which can be registered actually are <name/> unions I mean there is no need of having this particular statute at all because what <-/>what is it going to actually register or what is it that it is going to supervise All thing
s
 are supervised by <name/> and the rest Therefore I would say that there is uh no need of having this particular statute at this particular time If we want to seriously have trade unions independent trade unions then we would need another type of <./>re a
nother type of legislation and I would suggest that it should take the form of uh uh just like I have said yesterday <&/>}{\b\v grammar}{\v 
 society's ordinance something which is quite simple and it doesn't have the powers which are vested in the registrar of uh these
 particular trade unions Yah I'm reminded by the chairman that I should be winding up but I think there is another element which is discussed quite at length in here and I thought I should just take two minutes discussing it and this is the <name/> Act It
 
is also discussed in this particular report uh The <-/>the commission comes up with very important <-_conclusion><+_conclusions> and I think I should refer to it It appears on page eighty-two of the <-_>of the<-/> report that is the third book It says Rea
d
ing and I quote Reading from the Act closely one can simply say that <name/> cannot be said to be a trade union Now that is quite an important remark I have noted in various particularly in <name/> a newspaper which is issued by <name/> that they have tak
e
n a lot of pains to show that <name/> is a trade union I have come across one issue I've forgotten the <-/>the date on which it came out where the heading which I mean the secretary general of that particular organisation had said that <name/> is a trade 
u
nion and that appeared in very bold uh <-_>very bold<-/> print But then the content of that particular story was quite short and I was quite surprised that the heading was larger than the story itself simply because they had nothing to say I mean they cou
ld not show that this particular trade union is a trade union And after all if one can see then it <&/>}{\b\v grammar}{\v 
 doesn't have to shout that I can see Okay once you start shouting that you can see then it means you have problems with your eye-sight}{\b\v  <&/>laughter}{\v 
 I mean that is why it is quite obvious and it came out quite clearly in this There is something else which was discussed in this report with permission of Mr Chairman I think and this is the Industrial Courts Act number forty-one of nineteen sixty-seven 
and this was the former permanent <O/> trade union act And in that particular statute that is the statute which discusses strikes Now strikes have always been problematic and I'd like to <-/>to refer well I will refer only very briefly to what <name/> had
 said as regards strikes In one instance when he was speaking at the first annual congress of <name/> that was in ninety sixty-five he said and I quote }{\b\v <&/>quote>}{\v 
We believe that the strike weapon is to workers what armaments are appear to be to nations a <.
/>su a symbol of security and strength in a stupid world which you can only use only at the price of destroying the thing you are trying to protect in this case the well-being of the workers and just as we do not believe there is any special virtue in wag
ing a war on a country we believe there is virtue in avoiding it where possible So we do not regard the right to strike as a special gift to mankind We rely therefore upon other means of securing this objective 
\par Now those are the words which were spoken by 
<name/> at uh the annual conference of <name/> some time in nineteen sixty-five on twenty-fifth of March of nineteen sixty-five Now he was quite consistent in the sense that he actually went ahead and uh initiated the moves to enact a piece of legislation
 
which did not uh make strikes illegal Rather what they did was to make the procedure of striking legally so cumbersome that it became impossible uh The <-/>the procedure which is stipulated is tied in such a way that well I won't have the time to go throu
g
h it but actually the <-/>the whole procedure which is provided in the Act that is Industrial Courts' Act is such that it's almost impossible for someone to legally strike Now what the people have <-/>have devised is another way around Instead of striking
 
they <-/>they hold meetings Well I think Mr Chairman there is one aspect which I thought I should simply mention in passing and this is uh the local governments Okay and their aspect which they hold insofar as <O/> democracy is concerned This is an aspect
 
which has always been uh skipped uh This is an aspect which has not been receiving enough attention or the attention which it deserves And in this particular report I was quite happy to note that it was it has received the necessary attention uh in the pu
b
lic I mean in the in these local governments it is where the people use their power to manage their own affairs Now what happened in our in our history of thirty years is that this particular institution has been messed up by the central government that i
s
 the people who want to interfere into almost everything have gone so far to such an extent that they have virtually abolished this particular right Even after nineteen eighty-two when these governments were reintroduced after being abolished the their pe
r
formance has not been so good because of the interference and the fact they have <-_>they have<-/> been uh so mutilated out of context to such an extent that they cannot function properly But this is something which is also noted in here Now you wonder wh

\par }\pard \qj\nowidctlpar\tx7371\tx8505\adjustright {<I> <#/>Well as professor <name/> mentioned I'm going to talk about uh Zanzibar and particularly the question of ethni
city in the context of the revolution and the aftermath <#/>In nineteen sixty-four barely a month after Zanzibar achieved independence from Britain there was a bloody revolution <#/>It was one of the first <-_>one of the first<-/> coups in Africa of which
 
now we've become very familiar we've become used to it uh <#/>In Zanzibar which was a very small country at that time with a population of less than three hundred thousand quite a large number of people were killed between three thousand and thirteen thou
s
and and many others went into exile many onto the mainland and others further afield <#/>Now they're scattered all over the world <#/>Now this revolution at the time was described as the overthrow of an Arab minority by the African majority and that inter
p
retation has more or less remained <#/>It was the interpretation which was picked up immediately in the newspapers and some of the social science uh work which was being done at the time <#/>And this is what I would like to deal with uh to what extent the
 
<-/>the Zanzibar revolution was an overthrow merely of a <-_>of a<-/> racial minority because if the revolution was occurred to solve a racial problem in Zanzibar then it would not have been necessary thirty years later now for us to discuss the revolutio
n
 because it would have been an aspect of history maybe for the historians to deal with <#/>But the problem is that until today some of the fundamental problems of Zanzibar the conflicts internal political conflicts still persist <#/>So it must raise a que
s
tion <#/>What did the revolution do <#/>What did it try to solve and why do we have <./>consis persistent problems <#/>And my argument would be that the racial conflict was merely a thin veneer over much deeper social problems linked with Zanzibar <#/>Mos
t
 of the analyses of Zanzibar particularly the ones that have taken a racial interpretation start with the last census of Zanzibar which uh gave a racial breakdown of the population of Zanzibar <#/>And that census showed that there were seventy-six per cen
t
 so-called Africans and I'm putting that in inverted commas <#/>I will expect it will become clear why <#/>Seventeen per cent were Arabs and seven per cent were Indians and other minorities <#/>But it was very obvious to anybody who knows about Zanzibar i
s }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 that the African majority of seventy-six per cent will not act as a single social and political group <#/>So very quickly the people who had begun to adopt a racial interpretation an ethnic interpretation began now to try to see further sub-di
visions <#/>So then they began to make a distinction between the indigenous Africans who constituted something like fifty-six per cent and the mainland Africans who are something like nineteen per cent <#/>And then once you start on an ethnic interpretati
o
n we begin to slip even further and among the indigenous Africans you get further sub-divisions into the so-called tribes <#/>And I don't need to give you all these details <#/>The question is whether these racial pigeon holes which the social scientists 
a
re fond of whether they speak of a stable historical reality in the case of Zanzibar <#/>And this question comes up particularly if you bear in mind the history of Zanzibar over the previous two thousand years <#/>Zanzibar is located as the rest of the Ea
s
t African coast as a <./>peri <-_>as an<-/> area of interaction between Africa on the one hand and the Indian Ocean on the other hand <#/>For two thousand years the two worlds have been meeting along the coast and this is where it makes it difficult to uh
 
<-/>to have an ethnic interpretation <#/>If you look for example if you just start with the censuses themselves in answering the question whether these racial categories speak of any historical reality you'll find that there is one ethnic group which I di
d
 not mention which is the Swahili and everybody knows that Swahili is spoken along the East African coast and there must be people who are <-/>are Swahili <#/>The census of nineteen twenty-four showed that there were thirty-four thousand Swahilis in Zanzi
b
ar <#/>The census of nineteen forty-eight showed that they had disappeared from history <#/>None at all or a very small number <#/>There is another category called the Shirazi <#/>These are the people who are considered the indigenous Africans of Zanzibar
 
<#/>They numbered twenty-six thousand in nineteen twenty-four increased to forty-one thousand in nineteen thirty-one <#/>And yet when we come to nineteen forty-eight they had disappeared from the list <#/>I will <#/>Unfortunately I wasn't able to make eno
u
gh copies but if you could just share these around you can see from the graphs how these two ethnic groups commit ethnic hara-kiri as they would say and just disappear <#/>The reason why these ethnic categories are not stable is precisely what I said abou
t
 uh the long history of interaction between different people of different ethnic origins that had been living along the East African coast <#/>There has always been a considerable amount of intermarriage among the people themselves <#/>People who would uh
 
be considered African by one will be considered Arab by another <#/>We even have a category in <-/>in Zanzibar they say <ea/><O/> <#/>In other words people have to swear that I'm an Arab because otherwise he would not be recognised as an Arab because of t
h
e long history of uh intermarriage of adoption of the Swahili culture <#/>Most of the Arabs in Zanzibar until the revolution hardly could speak Arabic most of them were Swahili speaking and some of them <O/> as much as major literary figures in Swahili <#
/
>But ethnically they would be considered as people of Arabic origin <#/>So there was a lot of intermarriage uh between these various people <#/>Uh obviously intermarriage doesn't erase all distinctions <#/>There are class distinctions uh distinctions of o
r
igin and so on <#/>But the brief point is that ethnicity in Zanzibar is not a biological category not something that you can count in terms of the percentage of Arab blood that somebody has <#/>It is much more of a sociological dimension <#/>There are dif
f
erences there are distinctions in society <#/>These are sometimes expressed in ethnic terms but very often they reflect class relations within the society distinctions of culture and a number of other aspects <#/>Now what does origin then <#/>Why was ethn
i
c consideration taken to be as important in Zanzibar uh <#/>And I think something that this process that I've been describing of interaction between various uh groups that had been going on throughout all its history and particularly in the nineteenth cen
tury that when we come to the colonial period there is a certain degree of freezing of these ethnic categories which can be traced to the colonial policies <#/>I know this has become sometimes a <-/>a clich\'e9
 but it is still nevertheless true that the colonial rulers wherever they could they }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{\b /}{\b\v subject}{\v  }{
tried to divide the society into races and various ethnic groups for ease of <-/>of government <#/>So in the case of uh Zanzibar these were categorised as races and each of these races was given an app
ropriation of uh labour <#/>So in the case of Zanzibar the Arabs were described as landowners the Asians as merchants and the Africans as uh the workers <#/>After independence a lot of these colonial categories were questioned throughout Africa and even Z
anzibar <#/>But for quite a few social scientists they had }{\v <&/>}{\b\v structure}{\v  }{
difficulty accepting this easy <-/>accepting or rather rejecting the easy interpretation of the history of Zanzibar <#/>They tried to experiment with other labels like using Marx' cate
gories of class <#/>So they said okay races are not uh usable for tribes but uh classes are <#/>They are perfectly acceptable <#/>So if Arabs are landowners then you are talking about classes <#/>But the problem is that race and class do not coincide that
 all the racial all the ethnic uh boundaries cut across class-lines <#/>And again I might <O/> distribute another graph <#/>And I'll try now to explain how these different classes emerged not merely just taking }{\b\v <+_it>}{\v  }{
as it occurred at the particular time <
#/>I think basically you can say that the pattern of social differentiation in Zanzibar as I said began to develop during the nineteenth century when Zanzibar developed two sectors of the colony which were very important throughout the history <#/>One tha
t it was a centre of trade for the whole of Eastern Africa for various reasons that we don't really need to go }{\b\v <+_into>}{\v  }{
<#/>But all the trade of Eastern Africa of Kenya Uganda Tanganyika and in parts beyond it was generally through Zanzibar <#/>And that gav
e rise to an important merchant class which monopolised the trade and from which they benefited <#/>This merchant class was to start with uh Arab led by the Sultan of Oman at that time Said Said <name/> but it was also joined very early on by the Indians 
w
ho had come there <#/>They joined uh as merchants partly because they did not have an opening into land ownership <#/>That I will mention later on <#/>So these began to constitute a merchant class from the nineteenth century <#/>But what is important here
 
to remember is that although this constituted an important merchant class the whole of the commercial empire that Zanzibar built up in the nineteenth century began to break down with the colonial partition of Africa <#/>So the merchant class living in Zan
z
ibar no longer had control over its hinterland over Kenya which became British Tanganyika which became German and so on <#/>And therefore the merchant class in Zanzibar began to be impoverished <#/>Many of them migrated to the mainland <#/>Those who remai
n
ed in Zanzibar many of the sons had to change their profession from <./>mu from trade into civil service become teachers and so on <#/>Some of them went into lending money to the landowners <#/>But the important thing I want to leave you with is that this
 merchant class that had developed in the nineteenth century 
\par <X_>}{\v <$B> <#/>May I please interrupt you
\par <$A> <#/>Yes 
\par <$B> <#/>Would you please explain <O_>}{\b\v inaudible}{\v <O/>
\par <$A> <#/>Yes I will <-_>I will<-/> come to it Yes I'm sort of leading up to it uh when I read the second part I assume it's a bit too early I'm sorry }{</X>
<#/>So this merchant class began to disintegrate and a large proportion of uh the <-/>the former merchant class had actually been reduced to small shopkeepers civil servants teachers and so on artisa
ns <#/>So that was one sector of the economy on which Zanzibar had thrived in the nineteenth century and how the classes had begun to disintegrate <#/>The second was the plantation sector <#/>During the nineteenth century uh Zanzibar developed as a major 
p
lantation area growing cloves the spice cloves for which Zanzibar became famous <#/>And that plantation of course economy was based on slave labour coming from the interior of Africa <#/>Initially the <-/>the big landowners were Arabs uh particularly Oman
 
Arabs who had come with the Sultan and who were given large parcels of land <#/>But cloves like anybody who knows about Zanzibar and the clove economy the clove economy is very unstable uh <#/>Production fluctuation very very widely from year to year and 
t
he prices accordingly also fluctuate <#/>So it <-/>it was a very dangerous venture for any land-owning class <#/>So even during the nineteenth century the merchant class and the land-owning class was unstable <#/>Many of them were getting impoverished <#/
>
To add to these normal problems two events occurred in the eighteen seventies which broke the back of the land-owning class <#/>The first was a major hurricane which hit Zanzibar in eighteen seventy-two which wiped out almost the whole of the uh clove pla
ntation area almost the whole of it <#/>So all the clove trees had to be replanted <#/>Now that hurricane was in eighteen seventy-two <#/>In eighteen seventy-three }{\b\v <+_article>}{
 slave trade was abolished so that no fresh supplies of labour could come in <#/>N
ow under these conditions the land-owning class which is already precarious now had problems of dealing with shortage of labour and the problem of replanting <#/>And the net result was that they were not able to do it <#/>Not all of them were able to do i
t
 <#/>Many of them were forced to sell part of their land in order to <-/>to buy or to get labour to replant <#/>Many of them got heavily in debt <#/>And in this process of trying to re-establish themselves as uh <-/>as clove producers they were forced to 
apart from selling the land they were also forced to make arrangements with the local peasant population in Zanzibar and the two islands of <name/> and <name/> in order to get labour without having to pay money because they didn't have money <X_>}{\v 
and at the same
 time peasants like peasants in many other places when they are not enmeshed in a money economy they have no use of a lot of money They prefer to work on their own plots of land So they would not sell their labour power Instead they were prepared to <-/>t
o
 provide to cultivate to replant a plantation with clove trees and then have a share of the land itself which sounded very unusual to me When I read it the first time I said this can't be I can't imagine the land owner replanting the plantation and then g
iving half of it to uh <-/>to the peasants who helped clear the land and plant it but this system persisted }{</X></I>

a thing or person <#/>Now in this seminar uh we'll define social problems according to different writers emergence of social problems causes and their social control <#/>We'll take truancy poverty homosexuality unemployment and criminality as our case s

u
ctural functionalist and Marxist approaches uh <#/>The social problems as defined by <name/> in his book known as Social Problems nineteen-seventy are those conditions which have a negative impact on individual and social well-being as identified by socio
l
ogical analysis of the organisation and functioning uh of a <-/>a society <#/>Another sociologist <name/> in his book Social Problems defines a social problem as a condition which is defined by a considerable number of persons as a deviation from some soc
ial norms which they cherish <#/>Also according to }{\b\v <+_article>}{
 Encyclopaedia of Social Sciences social problems are described as perplexing questions about human societies proposed for solution <#/>So from these definitions we can simply say that a social p
roblem is any condition which affects the majority of the members of society negatively <#/>The most common social problems existing in many societies are drug addiction alcoholism criminality poverty teenage pregnancy uh delinquency prostitution marriage
 
and divorce problems mental illness and homosexuality <#/>And uh in this particular uh seminar the focus will be on truancy unemployment homosexuality poverty and crime uh <#/>Now let's begin with uh the emergence of social problems uh <#/>Something only 
b
ecomes a social problem when people see it as <-_a> threatening and undesirable <#/>For a social problem to emerge there must be people saying that uh something is wrong and that they want it stopped <#/>Hence the reaction of the significant group is cruc
i
al uh <#/>There must be some socially significant groups declaring an action or a condition to be a social problem <#/>But also there must be more through institutional support uh for instance church against abortion or mass media to publicise the problem
 
educate the people and making it open to public opinion <#/>Without institutional or mass media support a social problem uh may never emerge <#/>This can well be uh illustrated by uh smoking <#/>Many people believe it is bad and dangerous but they get lit
t
le institutional or mass media support uh but uh nowadays at least there are some uh uh institutional support and mass media that smoking is uh dangerous <#/>You'll find that in many places they write in buses or cars in public places you find uh that smo
king is forbidden smoking is not allowed no smoking and so on <#/>But as this must occur for something to emerge as a social problem uh a loss of interest and concern can lead to }{\b\v <+_article>}{ disappearance of }{\b\v <+_article>}{
 social problem <#/>For example in Nor
th America now with regard to premarital sex where there is little strongly organised criticism among groups with social power or influence <#/>Also in some societies social drinking does not become a social problem because many people do it and they do n
o
t want to be criticised <#/>They have controls placed over their right to drink <#/>But the best reason for this is that there is an institutional support <#/>Traditionally social drinking is a custom of many tribes in Africa uh Tanzania included but in s
o
me it is not and so it is a social problem <#/>For example in Zanzibar uh social drinking any alcoholic drinking is undesirable <#/>It's not allowed <#/>It's not known <#/><./>There uh Therefore a social problem is uh not <./>trans transferable I mean fro

 one society to another <#/>It is only a social problem in a particular social context and another good illustration is the smoking of marijuana <#/>It is legal in Jamaica but it's illegal in many other societies <#/>However most societies have pretty muc
h
 the same social problems <#/>Now let us see what are the general causes of social problems uh <#/>There are some general causes of social problems which differ among various interest social groups and they need to be identified in part <#/>First of all d
eviance <#/>By deviance it means any act which goes against the norms and values of a particular society by an individual or corporate members of a group which disregards to flout the norms and values }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 uh <#/>This is the major constituent of soci
al problems <#/>With society not being blamed the individual is not the only one uh to blame for most social problems uh <#/>What has frequently come to be blamed is one institution the family <#/>Most people belong to families but the families are not or
g
anised collectively anyway <#/>So they are easy to criticise and have no means of fighting back <#/>The family often gets blamed for such deviant behaviour because apart from reproduction the primary function of this institution is the inheritance of cult
ure uh morals norms and values to the new members of society <#/>It is its responsibility to make sure that the uh children do not deviate from the culture <#/>They conform to the norms and values of the society <#/>We must also confess that }{\b\v 
<+_article>}{ fam
ily is not the only institution responsible for culture maintenance uh <#/>There are other secondary ones like schools and religious institutions <#/>Well from the structural and functionalist approach uh when a member of society deviates from the culture
 
this indicates that one of the institutions responsible for shaping the behaviour of the individuals does not operate effectively <#/>Hence it is argued sometimes that uh social problems are there because of irresponsible members of society and these are 
o
ften irresponsible parents and elders <#/>Through the socialisation process uh individuals acquire certain uh behaviour <#/>Well uh <#/>On the other hand it is sometimes argued that uh heredity that is the transmission of physical traits from a parent to

 Marxian perspective it can be argued that division of labour can lead to some members of society having little wealth <#/>If the wealth is not distributed

 the view that uh there are social problems because there are ill-mannered and uh irresponsible lazy people <#/>Poverty <#/>It is the condition of those men and women who lack one or more of the essentials of human life <#/>It is believed by some people o

bly how far have minority rights been dealt with in international law international convention as well as domestic law and the third question is to what extent did the <name/> report address itself to minority rights in Tanzania and finally I would look a
t
 what are the rights of the minorities that require special attention <#/>Mr Chairman the concept of minorities is one of those different concepts to define and I dare say so far even in the international fora there is no universally accepted definition o
f
 what a minority group or a minority community is and I would say uh whether a given community is a minority or not is not a question of law it is a question of fact <#/>Now the nearest definition that I have is the definition given by the international c
o
urt of justice way back in nineteen thirty when they were giving their opinion on the question or on the dispute between Greek and Bulgarian emigrants and in that opinion which is dated thirty-first of July nineteen thirty the international court of justi
ce said }{\b\v\lang2057 <quote_> }{\lang2057 
A minority group is a group of persons living in a given country or locality having a race religion language traditions of their own and united by the identity of such race religion language and traditions in a sentiment of solidarity with 
a view to preserving their traditions maintaining their form of worship securing instruction and upbringing of their children in accordance with the spirit and traditions of their race and mutually assisting one another}{\b\v\lang2057 <quote/>}{
\v\lang2057  }{\lang2057 <#/>Now briefly what we see 
in that definition is that a minority is either an ethnic religious or linguistic or cultural group which is numerically smaller than the rest of the population of the state to which it belongs and which possesses cultural physical or historical character
i
stics either a religion a language which is different from the rest of the population and it is the difficulties of having a clear-cut concept that has made the question of minority a little bit uh tense and controversial in Africa In fact most of the Afr
i
can countries do not accept that they have what anything called minority communities or minority groups Now in the context of Tanzania my question will be uh do we have minorities and if so which are these minority communities and my question would be hav
e
 you heard about people called the <name/> <name/> <name/> who in my opinion in my view fall very closely to the definition that is given in this uh international court of justice opinion <#/>So it would appear from the definition that in order for there 
t
o be a minority in a given state you see the three basic elements are that first <-/>first that the minority should be a non-dominant group in the population and it should possess a culture a language or a religion which is so specific to itself very much
 
different from the rest of the population and the second characteristic or element would be that the community should be sufficient in number not too small sufficient in number to deserve the preservation of such traditions or characteristics and that tha
t
 minority should be loyal to the state within which it is living <#/>So that sort of definition avoids the question of succession or separation by some communities and so forth <#/>Now how far <-_>how far<-/> have minority rights been preserved internatio
n
ally and so forth <#/>Formerly this concept and the <-_conflict><+_conflicts> that has that have arisen about minority groups can be seen much more clearer if we look at the history of Europe from right in the seventeenth century up to to date and we hear
 
we still hear a lot of conflict ethnic conflicts and so forth <#/>Now I will not go into the history because it is going to take us extremely long but all that I can say in a summary is that if you look at the seventeenth century you will find that the co
n
cept of minority rights was very much used to preserve religious minorities against persecution you see so you'll find throughout Europe the concept is being used by those who belong to minorities in terms of religion to try and preserve their religion an
d
 in many cases the concept was also used as a pretext by some countries to invade other countries where they felt that religious minorities were not being given the freedom to worship <#/>For <-/>for <./>in <-/>for instance you'll find England intervening
 
in France in <-/>in sixteen fifty-five uh Holland intervening in France also to protect the so-called Calvinists and Sweden intervening in Poland in seventeen <?/>sixty-seven in order to protect Protestants so-called minorities in terms of religion <#/>No
w
 coming to the eighteenth century you'll find that several treaties are being concluded in Europe and the concept of minorities is being broadened not only uh being restricted to religious minorities but also to questions of languages the linguistic minor
i
ties uh racial minorities and so forth <#/>So a number of treaties are being concluded in Europe <#/>You have the Treaty of Vienna in eighteen fifteen between Austria and the Netherlands containing special protection for Belgian Catholic ethnic minorities
 
<#/>You have the final act of the Congress of Vienna signed in Vienna in eighteen fifteen by Austria France Britain and Portugal and Russia and Sweden where they are trying to safeguard the interests of national minorities particularly the Poles and the P
o
lish language and you have another convention the Treaty of Berlin in July eighteen seventy-eight between Germany Austria Hungary France and Britain and Italy which abolishes religious discrimination and so forth <#/>And the story goes on until you come t
o
 the twentieth century <#/>You have a lot of treaties and conventions to try to protect minorities <#/>So coming to the African continent and particularly in Tanzania the first thing that we can note both in terms of the constitution and domestic laws is 
t
hat there is no recognition in the internal law of the rights of ethnic and linguistic minorities <#/>As you remember I said there are minority communities in Tanzania which require special protection and the argument has been that this is the country of 
p
eople who are equal there are no language <-/differentiations> and according to the government we cannot distinguish the people of Tanzania by linguistic groups because there are so many linguistic groups and within the bigger linguistic groups if you say
 
the Sukoma you still have some dialects which <-/>which differ from one Sukoma area to another so you cannot really define the people of Tanzania in those terms <#/>That is the government argument and therefore the question of protecting a minority who ha
p
pen to be in a different linguistic group does not arise but I don't think whether that is true and I as I did say the question of whether you have minorities is really a question of fact and not <-/>not a question of law <#/>Now if we come down to the <n
a
me/> report volume two uh where you have the terms of no volume one the terms of <O/> <name/> report which are about seven there is no specific reference giving the commission in the course of its uh deliberations to look or to take into account the right
s
 of minority communities <#/>The only <-_>the only<-/> reference which is very very ambiguous appears in what the <name/> calls <ea_><O/><ea/> which I consider to be guidelines because there is <ea_><O/><ea/> <Ea_><O/><ea/> is probably terms of reference 
<
#/>Then there is <ea_></O><ea/> which would be some guidelines presidential guidelines to the commission and if you look at paragraph four sub-item five you see there is some mention there that the commission should try to incorporate the views of minorit
y communities that would be my definition but in Kiswahili it simply says <ea_>}{\b\v\lang2057 sentences}{\lang2057 <ea/> <Ea/><O/> etcetera would include }{\b\v\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\lang2057 
 these linguistic communities <#/>Probably members of the commission will tell us to what extent did they consult comm
unities like the <name/> and the <name/> to see whether their interests their special interests have been taken care of by the commission because it is my argument that these people belong to very different cultures to very different linguistic <-_group><
+
_groups> and their way of life is very much different from the <-_>from the<-/> rest of the population in Tanzania <#/>I will give you examples <#/>In nineteen seventy-five during the villages and <name/> villages exercise the government attempted to mode
r
nise the <?/>Sandawe by collecting them in villages establishing schools and teaching them farming <#/>And do you know what happened <#/>If you go there you'll find schools without children farms without the <?/>Sandawe and it is all a relic of a disaster
 
because these people are essentially food gatherers and hunters and that is what all that they know about <#/>So to try to modernise them by actually destroying their culture is in fact to more contrary to some of the accepted internationally accepted con
ventions about the protection of minorities }{\b\v\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\lang2057 
 <#/>And if you look at the constitution <-_>if you look at the constitution<-/> in the Bill of Rights article thirteen sub-article one article twenty-one sub-article two and article nineteen sub-artic
le one you see there is express provision that the government <-_>the government<-/> must always take account of the freedoms and liberties of people such as the ones I'm talking about to make sure that they have the freedom of religion and the freedom to
 
live the way they are used to and by no means to enforce them to live the way the government thinks they should live because that was because that will always prove a disaster <#/>Now in the <-_>in the<-/> UN convention on the prevention and punishment of
 genocide it is provided that any attempt <-_>any attempt<-/> whether deliberate or otherwise to try to change the conditions of way of life of an ethnic community is genocide because you are destroying them <#/>Mr Chairman I will stop there </I>
