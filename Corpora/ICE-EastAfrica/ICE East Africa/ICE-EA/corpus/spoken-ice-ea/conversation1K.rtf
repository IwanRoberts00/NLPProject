\par <$E> <#/>By the way you know if you really value

\par <$E> <#/>Okay <#/>That is confidentiality which okay <#/>But what I\rquote m saying is there are those moments of course there are those things you discuss the two of you and those are stories betw

\par <$A> <#/>No there are some of these things are highly confidential
\par <$E> <#/>Bu yeah But some of these that's what I'm saying like now this one }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>overlap}{\fs24\lang2057  they are not that confidential
\par <$B> <#/>But you see Francis unless I tell you this is a secret and don\rquote t tell anybody even Jwan <#/>You will always think that it's not very serious so you will go and tell anybody even Jwan
\par <$A> <#/>No but you see
\par <$C> <#/>Do have any 
\par <$A> <#/>You see what happens here is that there can be a time where a topic can arise and maybe you want to compare like and like <#/>But I'm just not going to come from the blues and oh Olivia was saying this and this <#/>We 
can't gossip like that <#/>That is tantamount to gossiping
\par <$E> <#/>No it\rquote s just that <#/>You know that day <#/>Yeah You know why we said that <#/>In fact we remember after discussing that story so we said We told Alex uh <ea/>haki }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&_>Kiswahili: really<&/> }{\fs24\lang2057

\par <$B> <#/>No me I don\rquote t believe in that
\par <$E> <#/>I\rquote m telling you from a scholar\rquote s point of view
\par <$B> <#/>Uh Yeah <#/>But because I have seen so many people who

\par <$B> <#/>No <#/>Let\rquote s continue in this particular
\par <$C> <#/>Do you know what you feel <#/>That is exactly what it is <#/>Those are the <./>physio physiological needs <#/>When you hungry you are starving
\par <$A> <#/>You know like <#/>You know a physiological need now from psychological point of view is that one which you must satisfy in order to acquire another one
\par <$A/$E> <#/>to move to the next the next yeah
\par <$B> <#/>But <-/>but you can acquire others before you satisfy sexual }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>overlap}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$C> <#/>A physiological need No

\par <$C> <#/>Not along those lines
\par <$B> <#/>That is uh
\par <$C> <#/>Not along those lines
\par <$B> <#/>Uh Because like you want maybe to uh <-/>to uh <-/>to acquire status or something like that for instance or security <#/>You don\rquote t have first of all to have a <-/>a sexual partner to <#/>Uh It\rquote s not necessary
\par <$E> <#/>Not really in that way }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>overlap}{\v\fs24\lang2057  <#/>Not exactly in that way but 
\par <$C> <#/>No not in <#/>You see In every line I think a psychologist is here he can tell us a lot more <#/>When I was doing psychology we were taught that <-/>that sex is a physiological need So 
\par <$E> <#/>Which it is
\par <$C> <#/>Uh It is yeah <#/>That\rquote s the truth <#/>You see
\par <$E> <#/>You just <./>don <#/>You okay you see }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>overlap}{\v\fs24\lang2057  <#/>The thing is okay the thing is you see the thing is by the way <#/>We are not saying that you have to have it in your life to move on or to you know 

\par <$B> <#/>That\rquote s what I meant
\par <$E> <#/>But it is a physiological need that you need to satisfy before you move to the security needs and to the <./>se social needs and up to the other needs
\par <$B> <#/>But you see Olivia I\rquote m <-/>I\rquote m saying uh You know it\rquote s like food you can you cannot do

\par <$B> <#/>You can even do without sex forever <#/>You can abstain forever
\par <$A> <#/>No 
\par <$B> <#/>Yeah <#/>You can
\par <$A> <#/>Don\rquote t trust these people who go telling you they don't do it
\par <$B> <#/>Me I trust them
\par <$C> <#/>Don't give me example of priests
\par <$E> <#/>And who <-/>who tell you that they abstain 
\par <$A> <#/>Because those are the worst }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$C> <#/>Let me give you an example of a priest

\par <$C> <#/>I don\rquote t give you an example of a nun

\par <$B> <#/>Let me tell you I don\rquote t like that idea of people generalising since one priest is doing that because you have to look at them as human beings

\par <$E> <#/>And to err is human by the way
\par <$C> <#/>That\rquote s true

\par <$C> <#/>That is very true
\par <$B> <#/>But I <-/>I would always want to believe that they don\rquote t do it <#/>And I am satisfied with that
\par <$E> <#/>Which is a wrong belief
\par <$C> <#/>It\rquote s true 
\par <$B> <#/>No <#/>Because that is It\rquote s just like you tell me <ea/>ati uh us we're married but we don't do it you see I would always want to believe that since you are married you do it
\par <$C> <#/>Yeah I see
\par <$E> <#/>Or }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>overlap}{\v\fs24\lang2057  But you see by the way it\rquote s all in the head <#/>It\rquote

hree <-/>three days <#/>These three days that have <-/past> I made two major decisions <#/>Booting friends <#/>You have the wish to keep them but your <-/>your mind stroke brain wants to boot them because they are kind of infringing 
\par <$B> <#/>Your principles
\par <$D> <#/>Yes exactly
\par <$A> <#/><./>Whe <./>Whe When they do uh uh you will just have to but you take a choice you know
\par <$D> <#/>What can you do <#/>For example let me <-_>let me<-/> give you a very practical example <#/>It's like this <#/>You give somebo
dy your notes personal notes <#/>Then you tell her please bring these notes tomorrow morning <#/>She brings them in the evening <#/>Then what happens is this once she brings them in the evening you ask her what happened <#/>She tells you that I had not fi
nished with your notes <#/>Is that a <./>jus <-_>is that a<-/> very good reason for not returning your notes <#/>Then what happens is this when I go for a Kiswahili lecture and then I bounce a <-/>a philosophy lecture I come and tell her }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\fs24\lang2057  Can yo
u <./>Ca <-_>Can you<-/> give me your notes so that I can go and copy<#/> In fact it was the lecture about the end of a human act <#/>Then she says no reason <#/>She gives no reason <#/>Then today I told her very early in the morning that that time you we
re telling me that you <-/>you will have that <#/>There was some reading going on here 
\par <$B> <#/>Okay I <-/>I know the <-/>the <-/>the <-/>the situation }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\fs24\lang2057  <#/>I decided to keep away
\par <$A> <#/>You <-/>You read between the lines yeah
\par <$B> <#/>Yeah
\par <$A> <#/><O/>
\par <$D> <#/>He had to do because I <-/>I called her and then I told her that I want to talk to you but <#/>Yeah <./>let let's talk <#/>Uh Therefore I told her like this 
\par <$B> <#/>And then you received her }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>overlap}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$D> <#/>Very simply it's lik
e this <#/>You requested my notes <#/>I got angry when I got your message that you had written that I promised you that I'll give you my notes <#/>That was not true because I did not promise you <#/>I just said probably I'll bring my notes tomorrow meanin
g
 on Friday evening <#/>Then I said Okay that's it <#/>We <-/>We went and then I also added that uh <-/>that is what I said therefore your promise according to the philosophy of language a promise it means a lot <#/>It means a lot <#/>There is a difference
 between promise and probability <#/>Therefore I said okay that's what I said <#/>Therefore you are wrong on that in <-/>in writing that message in fact <#/>Therefore I said 
\par <$B> <#/>You <-/>you didn't promise her 
\par <$D> <#/>I didn't promise <#/>Therefore I still I <-/>I asked her do you still want the notes <#/>Yes <#/>But I <-/>I <-/>I love to make you remember two incidents that happened in second year <#/>And you'll tell me whether or not I'm just finally giving 
you my notes
\par <$B> <#/>Okay
\par <$D> <#/>Then I started <#/>Okay one time I gave you my Mazrui notes <#/>In fact I had mentioned that thing in class on Thursday <#/>And I said okay I'll give you my notes <#/>What happened <#/><O/> how <-/>how long did I stay wit
h your notes <#/>I told her that uh you stayed with my notes for more than eight hours and each and every minute means a lot to me <#/>What was the end of the first incident <#/>Then the second one <#/>I told her about those uh notes she refused to give <
#
/>Said that I can't remember <#/>You know what I told her I'm very sorry <#/>I don't like this but I'm very sorry to have such a memorable mind <#/>I <-/>I just I don't I just don't want you to remember things <#/>It's very unfortunate but I have a very v
ivid memory }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$A> <#/>You mean clear memory 
\par <$D> <#/>Yeah <#/>A clear memory not a vivid one <#/>And then I said okay that's it 
\par <$B> <#/>That's the first uh one of the major decisions
\par <$D> <#/>Yeah <#/>And then she took off hungrily
\par <$A> <#/>And there <-/>there goes a friend but anyway you know what uh at the end of the day I was telling this guy Me I believe if you\rquote 
ve done the right thing it's <-/>it's okay because if that's the kind of a friend she is where <./>every everything just rotates around and about her her interest then uh you are better off relegate her to an acquaintance 
\par <$B> <#/>Surely
\par <$D> <#/>Sure
\par <$A> <#/>And that's <-_>and that's<-/> as much as it stands right now because if she comes back to <ea/>gus }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&_>Kenyan English slang: talk<&/> }{\fs24\lang2057 with you I mean I don't think you <-/>you would refuse her but still you
\rquote ll you <-/>you\rquote ll <-/>you\rquote ll have established your limits you have established what kind of a person she is and uh that's the most important thing
\par <$B> <#/>And I think this a major I <-/>I may presuppose that this a major tendency that uh most of our ladies here uh uh are fond of <-/>of <-/>of <-/>of <-/>of acquiring some sort of or <-/>or using
\par <$C> <#/>You see they <-/>they <-/>they <-/>they are not out to assist you <#/>In most cases you find it that it\rquote s a one way kind of traffic kind of relationship uh }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>overlap}{\fs24\lang2057  <#/>She She\rquote s not 
\par <$A> <#/>But that's the society <#/>Everyone is just opportunistic you know
\par <$D> <#/>Why
\par <$C> <#/>Where <-/>Where can we place the blame now 
<#/>Because for one thing they have been fighting for equality and with this equality that they are fighting for me I believe that you first have to <-/>to level the ground and make sure that everything is at par such that whatever she gets if she gets fi

\par <$A> <#/>But you see there\rquote s <-/>there\rquote s this question yeah somebody was posing uh the Kenyan the <-/>the <-/>the Nairobian lady <#/>I mean we are working in the a

\par <$D> <#/>abstain from what Opela
\par <$B> <#/>From making friends <O/>
\par <$A> <#/>No <-/>no I mean it's so healthy to <#/>It's there is no problem <#/>The only <-_>The only<-/> fact is it's <-/>it's a reality like <-/>like okay I've had a
 girlfriend <#/>Now the relationship is over I mean when <-/>when <-/>when we are the guys believe you me I\rquote ll tell you uh <#/>Us guys are getting married }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\fs24\lang2057 
 getting married you know <#/>We are into the real thing you know <#/>And things happen you realise <#/>Oh okay <#/>The marriage was postponed or rather put off }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\fs24\lang2057

\par <$A> <#/>No you make <#/>You make friends you make uh <#/>You actually uh I personally I believe it's healthy <#/>I mean you learn so much <#/>So that when you have the <-/>the person you're really you know uh serious with you\rquote ll not 
be making some funny <-/>funny errors 
\par <$D> <#/>In fact that was what I }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>overlap}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$C> <#/>I\rquote m not a person who makes trials and errors <#/>You make a trial and it\rquote s the thing the real thing <#/>You are very serious about it <#/>And you play your part ev
en if the part is not played by the other party <#/>Then it's not a mistake 
\par <$B> <#/>This is why I'm saying that there is a problem <#/>We <-/>We don't know where to draw the line between uh the <-/>the real the <-/>the <-_>the real<-/> <#/>Okay if I may use the term courtship <O/> this discussion
\par <$D> <#/>Yeah
\par <$B> <#/>If we can't draw that line it <-/>it is difficult to draw it and <-/>and maybe to identify someone who is not wholly committed <#/>If it's the man he might be cheating the lady that oh you 
know whereby you are the one and <-/>and you are mean a lot to me and <-/>and such like sweet nothings if I may say so }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\fs24\lang2057  <#/>If it\rquote s the <-_>If it\rquote 
s the<-/> lady she might also put all the <-_>all the<-/> all those kinds of words whenever they m
eet one another <#/>But finally one of them is going to disappoint the other yeah <#/>There's a problem you can you can't <-_>you can't<-/> tell who is cheating and who is }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>overlap}{\fs24\lang2057  giving true love
\par <$D> <#/>Therefore you've identified the problem <O/>
\par <$B> <#/>You can't <#/>Okay this is what I'm trying to get from you <#/>I'm saying that it's hard for me to draw that line so what can you do 
\par <$D> <#/>Between a problem and a solution or between problems
\par <$B> <#/>Okay it is between uh uh <#/>Maybe you did not get me clearly or maybe I\rquote 
m not the one who is getting you clearly <#/>I'm saying it's very difficult to draw a line between the one who is uh giving true love and one who is cheating the other
\par <$A> <#/>You are right <#/>Because me honestly speaking ok
ay some relationships me I look at them like this uh I just wonder I mean uh is it for conveniences purposes or is it for the <-_>for the<-/> fact that we are in this age so in this age people normally have girlfriends so even me I have one <#/><O/> some 
just don\rquote t think serious you know <#/>Okay some look serious but you can just see that honestly is isn\rquote t it <#/>They are you know like uh skewed you know <#/>It's <-/bended> <#/>on one side and you know someone is <#/>I don\rquote t know

\par <$D> <#/>But on this line I think I can support ladies because most people who are serious about relationships <O/> courtships }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar }{\fs24\lang2057 they are ladies <O/> <#/>Guys are never serious 
\par <$C> <#/><O/> Can you <-_>Can you<-/> substantiate }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>overlap}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$D> <#/>I have a lot of friends who tell me how they can probably uh <#/>This lady she's <-/>she\rquote s just there for a short short-term basis and then I <-/>I know <-_>I know<-/> the person I will marry <#/>Not this kind <#/>She's just here to I don
\rquote t know <#/>The guy is biding his time <
#/>Therefore but for ladies you approach a lady and ask her How do you think about your guy <#/>She'll tell you that <-/>that is the guy of my dreams probably imagining getting one of his sons or daughters <#/>They think very far <#/>But for guys I'm tell
ing you they just see someone very close either just for marriage 
\par <$A> <#/><O/>
\par <$D> <#/>I I'm saying most guys not all guys <#/>I'm making myself clear <#/>Most guys <#/>And most people who are serious <#/>I repeat once again are ladies about relationship
s <#/>Though if you find some who are not serious that is ladies then just regret why you fell in love in the first place }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\fs24\lang2057  <#/>Because they can torment you uh
\par <$A> <#/>'Till all hell breaks loose }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$D> <#/>Otherwise we'll have to wait and see <#/>Experience is

\par <$D> <#/>Yes 
\par <$?> <#/><O/> best lecturer 
\par <$D> <#/>the best lecturer
\par <$B> <#/><O/> I think there\rquote s this thing we wanted to talk about <#/>What happens when }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>overlap}{\fs24\lang2057  a person dies

\par <$A> <#/>What was not happening
\par <$B> <#/>What <-/>What <-/>What I expected was not happening 
\par <$A> <#/>What did you expect
\par <$B> <#/>I expected 
\par <$A> <#/>What did you get
\par <$B> <#/>Yeah surely and uh <-/>and uh in this situation I thought that uh maybe it was supposed to be a meeting between those uh visitors from Makerere University 
\par <$A> <#/>they meant it to be a <-/>a meeting uh and then
\par <$B> <#/>between Makerere students and uh <-/>and <O/>officials or <-/>or <O/> members
\par <$A> <#/>Okay
\par <$B> <#/>So and I went there and found out okay it was some kind of a <-/>a just a general discussion okay involving uh students from all <-/>all <-/>all

\par }\pard\plain \s16\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<$A> <#/>Uh we were <-_>we were<-/> discussing pan-Africanism <#/><./>Wha What do you think of pan-Africanism 
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang1031 {\fs24\lang2057 <$D> <#/>On pan-Africanism I can talk a lot courtesy of
\par <$A> <#/>Generally
\par <$D> <#/>Professor Ali Mazrui I know 
\par <$A> <#/>Shortly Briefly
\par <$D> <#/>Very briefly pan-Africanism should I say at initially it was a Negro movement but nowadays it's a movement of governments in Africa in the Caribbean 
\par <$A> <#/>Okay a movement of governments but <./>wha what are <-_>what are<-/> you going to boil down is that does pan-Africanism really exist truly speaking
\par <$D> <#/>You know it depends from which school of thought you are arguing from <#/>If you are a Eurocentric definitely you will say that this thing is a myth <#/>If you are Afrocen
tric you will say it's a reality <#/>Do you know why even these scholars we think that they <-/>they <O/> <#/>They have some kind of bias whereby if from a Eurocentric perspective you cannot argue that pan-Africanism is a reality <#/>Mazrui argues from an
 
Afrocentric and says it is a reality and we have five types of pan-Africanism and goes out to <-/>to delineate <-_this><+_these> kinds of pan-Africanisms whereby we have this <./>sub uh sub-Saharan pan-Africanism about the black country scene black Africa
 the so-called sub-Saharan Africa We have this other one which links us with these people who are uh Arabs 
\par <$B> <#/>The <./>no <-/>the northern
\par <$D> <#/>Yeah the northerners by arguing that though there is the Sahara desert in between 
\par <$?> <#/><O/>
\par <$D> <#/>Yeah the this <./>bri this Sahara desert is more of a bridge than a death trap <#/>When you go to the <./>Cari Caribbean islands we find that there is this <./>west western-hemispheric pan-Africanism whereby we have uh these people coming togethe
r having }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>noise }{\fs24\lang2057 uh unions that can uh cater for their welfare because of being <./>ensel enslaved together 
\par <$B> <#/>That is <./>whi which region 
\par <$D> <#/>The western-hemispheric region Caribbean islands and }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>overlap}{\fs24\lang2057  that kind of things <#/>Then we h
ave this kind of transatlantic pan-Africanism whereby the black Americans or the so-called African-Americans nowadays link up with <-_this><+_these> <#/>sub-Saharan and <./>transatlan <./>tran trans-Saharan pan-Africanists and argue that uh we are all bla
c
ks <#/>We've been through hard times together <#/>These governments have been very rough to for us <#/>And then the whole thing is encompassed in the global pan-Africanism <#/>And that is what I think Oscar is asking about <#/>And therefore it <-/>it all 
depends from where you are arguing
\par <$B> <#/>School of thought
\par <$D> <#/>Yeah 
\par <$A> <#/>But how is the consciousness <#/>Pan-Africanism viewed as <-_a> consciousness was a was more or less a psychic spiritual thing you know You are conscious of uh your values
 as <-/>as <-/>as <-/>as blacks you know as uh <-/>as you try to bring that unity amongst you a unifying factor which is a uh being from Africa being black and uh having finished you know marginalisation in terms of economic and uh political stress from <
-/>from the outside world yeah <#/>Just how much }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>interruption }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>Just how much of that is in <-_>is in the<-/> <-_>is in the<-/> common man today 
\par <$D> <#/>One problem is that in Africa especially Africa <./>sou sub-Saharan Africa we have a problem wit
h culture <#/>You know culture is a very simple word that people just pass by <#/>But if you sit down and analyse what culture is all about you come to realise that in sub-Saharan Africa we have a cultural crisis identity crisis whereby people disrespect 
their culture <#/>And this is unheard of <-_>unheard of<-/> in any part of }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article> }{\fs24\lang2057 
world <#/>People are very very uh serious about their culture <#/>But in Africa we have a problem People don't want to identify with their so-called traditional beliefs s
imply because they've been told <./>the these beliefs are primitive uncivilised barbaric <#/>You name them <#/>Therefore without first of all sitting down and reconstructing what was destroyed by colonialism and its predecessor uh slavery and such kind of
 
things or its successor neo-colonialism right now I don't think we are going anywhere This is a problem that faced African countries on the eve of independence <#/>Instead of these leaders sitting down and discussing how to reconstruct this culture that h
a
s been that had been at least destroyed by all those years of colonialism they embarked on trying to achieve economic dreams for example industrialisation without taking into consideration that these people have to be sensitised that they are black <#/>Th
e
y have to be sensitised that they have a common cause with the other blacks in all those spheres Mazrui observes <#/>We just have to sit down and we say okay Minister of Finance do something about the budget <#/>Do something about this <#/>Therefore there
 is no way people can be conscious of pan-Africanism and yet we do not do something about our culture <#/>And that is why it doesn't have a a lot of adherents in Africa 
\par <$B> <#/>And just to add on what you are talking about maybe if I <-/>I may go to <-/>t
o the grass-root level that even to identify ourselves uh with our own nation-state has been a problem in some of the African states such that uh there is this factor that has been hindering this <-/>this consciousness at the larger level of I mean <./>pa
n
-Akr pan-Africanism at <-/>at that <-_>at that<-/> level because one thing ethnicity is a major factor <#/>People do identify themselves in most cases with their ethnic groups and <-/>and the ethnic origins rather than with their own nation as a whole fir
st of all I mean nation-state <#/>And uh <-/>and it\rquote 
s from this level <./>where whereby we uh <-/>we might come together and uh okay <#/>As a result of this <-/conscienceness> we might come together and uh <-/>and uh be unified as blacks within Africa or bl
acks within the <./>eth ethnic continental level <#/>So ethnicity is a major hindrance 
\par <$D> <#/>Okay 
\par <$?> <#/>Okay we
\par <$D> <#/>What were they discussing there
\par <$A> <#/>Somebody presented a paper so-called a paper <#/>She talked about pan-Africanism <#/>Then
\par <$B> <#/>Was she from <-/>from here

We talked about culture <#/

\par <$D> <#/>Okay I understand <#/>I think you are talking about the material culture <#/>You fail to identify that we have two types of culture <#/>The material culture is what we want to establish to re-establish in fact 
\par <$A> <#/>Yeah I mean I too <-/>I <-/>I touched on that and I see it yeah <#/>The <-/>the part of our culture that remains is probably our unity in the extended family <#/>That\rquote s not really material as such is it

If you just take each and every individual and you can quantify that okay he has this measure of culture our traditional culture in him still <#/>Just what you know <#/>What percentage of uh the population in let\rquote

u
h a certain traditional god <#/>You know when <-/>when <-/>when uh probably some <-/>some <-/>some cultures still hold it in that for them when someone dies there's just so much you know uh <-_>there's so much<-/> <-_>there's so much<-/> don't dos and dos
 that have to you know go about with the funeral but still at the end of the day they <-/>they <-/>they have changed yeah <#/>There\rquote

\par <$A> <#/>I think it uh funerals used to be something <O/> <#/>Well we can't blame anybody when there's a <-_>there's a<-/> strong influence from another culture what <-/>what would you expect <#/>Or what do you guys think
\par <$D> <#/>What I think about this whole affair of culture is that we're the problem <#/>In fact it's identified by Professor <
name/> that when these people came they came with their own culture <#/>And the African culture was supplanted by this foreign culture <#/>And in order I think in order to try to re-establish what was in fact my <./>obje my prime objection is we miss imma
t
erial culture erosion <#/>Not material culture as such <#/>Material culture has nothing to do with it <#/>What is immaterial is always more important because it reflects how you think how you respect people how you obey them such kind of things the <-/>th
e way you dress <#/>There is no problem with this European dress <#/>The problem is how we and when we wear these things because the 
\par <$?> <#/><O/>
\par <$D> <#/>Yeah <#/>For example mini-skirts <#/>It was in the immaterial culture of the Africans most Africans 
that a lady should not display her thighs <#/>The European brought a long dress and a short one <#/>Now where is the problem <#/>If she wears the long dress she will have betrayed the material culture of wearing skins <#/>When she wears the short one she 
betrays both you see the material and immaterial culture <#/>This is where the problem lies 
\par <$A> <#/>Okay like now uh there's this <-_>there's this<-/> thing about wife inheritance <#/>In light of what you know would you <-_>would you<-/> like uphold such a culture
\par <$C> <#/>There is no problem with wife inheritance
\par <$D> <#/>In fact I was at Mary's place 
\par <$B> <#/>Okay
\par <$D> <#/>and I had to run away from that discussion }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\fs24\lang2057  because it was Mary and another guy called <name/> <#/>They introduced that wife inheritance <#/>And I was quiet for around seven minutes }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>overlap}{\fs24\lang2057  listening to them
\par <$B> <#/>That\rquote s a very long time
\par <$D> <#/>because there was one day this the Philosophical Students' Association held this debate about <O/> and <name/> presented a paper yes <#/>And then we discussed that paper for around two hours and <name/> said this s
o-called wife inheritance is a connotation from a Eurocentric point of view <#/>What we have is a companionship <#/>He used very good words

\par <$A> <#/><O/>
\par <$D> <#/>Therefore he said it\rquote s <-/>it\rquote s wife guardianship family guardianship a lot of terms 
\par <$A> <#/>I think <-_>I think<-/> okay did he specify what <-/>what the so-called quote unquote wife inheritance implies
\par <$
D> <#/>The whole affair <#/>Briefly he said it like this <#/>A wife who is a widow uh may decide whether or not even according to the Luo traditional customs whether or not she will be inherited quote unquote <#/>And if she decides she will be inherited s
he decides among the brothers of the clan she is in <#/>You know he was arguing for 
\par <$?> <#/><O/> 
\par <$B> <#/>I think no I think what <-/>what it should be or what it used to be is this that it was <-/>it <-/>was }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\fs24\lang2057  like this <#/>When <-/>When the 
husband died the widow had no choice other than being inherited because for one thing }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>overlap}{\fs24\lang2057 
 she was regarded yeah she was regarded as the property I mean as <-/>as the member a member of that family you see In fact he was married to 
\par <$A> <#/><O/>even when <-_>even when<-/> he is alive <#/>The minute you get married in the African culture or rather in the <-_>in the<-/> Euro-culture we became part and parcel of the family where the man comes from
\par <$D> <#/>That is true <#/>That is what Mr <name/> said
\par <$B> <#/>Yeah he said so
\par <$A> <#/>To an <./>e <-_>To an<-/> extent that when you die you cannot be buried by your dad <#/>You're buried by your in-laws <#/>Yes to the extent that when he dies someone has to <#/>Okay there <-/>there <-/>there are virtues th
at went with it <#/>This guy who inherited you was there to take over the roles of the brother providing for you you know uh taking care of you and his children <#/>And in any case fulfilling each and every role that goes with it
\par <$C> <#/>Yeah that is what I understand I can remember very well
\par <$A> <#/>But you see at the end of the day I <O/> <#/>He defended <O/> guardianship or what calling it wife inheritance is not a really <#/>Because after all uh what is inheritance <#/>When my dad dies I take over his empire yeah <#/>And it\rquote 
s a business empire for manufacturing textiles I take over and I'm the boss now <#/>I'm the man 
\par <$D> <#/>Yeah
\par <$A> <#/>And uh from henceforth the decisions that have <O/> are made for by me <#/>In other words I run the company <#/>So by me inheritance inherits the wife he assumes each and every role so to speak
\par <$C> <#/>Yes
\par <$A> <#/>And provide for the children and give advice <#/>Well you know after all your my wife <O/>
\par <$D> <#/>Yeah I remember that that discussion took two hours and when we were standing with Mr <name/> outside there in that corner then we discussed for another two hours <#/>The questions are these <#/>In fact Mary was asking <name/> <name/> is a Luo

\par <$?> <#/>Uh
\par <$D> <#/>A
\par <$A> <#/>Oh Mary <#/>Mary is a Luo uh
\par <$D> <#/>Yeah <#/>Does the present situation in the country call for such kind of customs to be continually you know practised by these uh <#/>You know the society has changed <#/>She was arguing the society has changed <#/>Therefore does the present econ

\par <$D> <#/>React to that 
\par <$A> <#/>}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>overlap }{\fs24\lang2057 What I would say is <#/>I mean you don't need we don't need the economic conditions as such to make u

 by the South African government and the South African government in turn will suppose were supposed pay now pay the Portuguese government and the Portuguese government again in turn you know contract uh deduct whatever it considered as tax <O/> <-/>mhm y
eah <O/> drawing from the pay yeah from the pay of this
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang1031 {\fs24\lang2057 <$A> <#/>I tell what it means they give the family to the <O/>
\par <$B> <#/>yeah
\par <$A> <#/>this was a regular manner
\par <$B> <#/>okay so is like uh this contract worker was <-/>was isolated as he put it but we
 know really that uh the contract workers were really working in South Africa so is like this <-/>this is a letter now I think as you rightly put it addressing to <-/>to one of his lovers
\par <$A> <#/><-/>mhm <slang/>'coz I'm imagining <-_>I'm imagining<-/> somebody's old factory they had to go home if at all they go home and he's addressing somebody who he's really loving one he loves but he's away from her
\par <$B> <#/>yeah so <-/>so how can we identify the okay the <-/>the generally the pain of this particular p
oint <#/>I wanted you I wanted to address you to <-/>to this particular line on the a nameless pain which pursues me a nameless pain which <-/>which is this pain he is talking about
\par <$A> <#/>of this pain which the <O/> want <#/>I feel a nameless pain which pursues me <#/>is it the pain of separation
\par <$B> <#/>yeah now that we have identified from what that what we have said we have already identified that uh that is isolation it is lack of education and the basic emotion here is love is it <#/>So perhaps we 
can say that uh that reference to a nameless pain has to do with uh that aloneness that this gentleman must be feeling wherever he is
\par <$A> <#/>due to their separation
\par <$B> <#/>I don't know that is maybe but you can make additions
\par <$A> <#/>I guess the pain 
he <-_feel><+_feels> hurt there is this person he loves very much but apparently is far for him and the <-/>the <-/>the use of the word pain it is not something that maybe he caused to happen <#/>It's not his fault that they are separated <#/>Could be it 
is the system that was <?/>wanted to <-_separation><+_separate> them that have to force people to get out of their homes go and work for long days or months without having to see their families so that pain of separation from especially somebody who loves

\par <
$B> <#/>yeah <#/>let me just to make uh an addition <#/>It could also refer to the anguish that he feels within himself the anguish of uh what <-_have><+_has> happened the dream of life of him and his likes <#/>It becomes a constant stigma in terms that t
o feel that you just must be a contract worker that <-/>that is your destiny and that kind of feeling
\par <$A> <#/>and also that it has to relegating to that kind of life you know where how you <O/> that together you have to communicate this way you can never stay together anymore
\par <$B> <#/>and also this it is this destiny to hiding the nature of this contract not aiming at his memories not perhaps to something that is a bit <-_>a bit<-/> as he put it is a it is <-_>it is<-/> some anguish which is in the heart bu
t apart from this that I think it is also something which is again uh so immense it is not just one there is other pains
\par <$C> <#/>yes <#/>I don't know
\par <$B> <#/>it it's a pain not as we know it in the ordinary sense this is a pain that is unique
\par <$A> <#/>is it why it is taken it is nameless this term nameless <#/>Why has it been
\par <$B> <#/>yeah or <O/> express
\par <$C> <#/>there is something which I really <#/><O/> if he says it pursues me which means it is constant in his life it is something that foll
ows him night and day it is something that is in him will come really <O/> so it is uh I would say it is like uh a stigma and then again this is your point as you say you know he can't write and really the idea of this poem is that this guy wants to write
 
a letter to whoever he loves but he can't write so what <-/>what is your modification as in the context of this point <#/>Does he complain that he doesn't have education as a tool to help him communicate his emotions his feelings to the other person or do
es he look at it with uh <-/>with uh in a satirical manner as to say just that uh maybe perhaps he doesn't need it at all <#/>What is your view what is education is a very central issue during that particular time like in the camp of <O/>
\par <$B> <#/>you're really
\par <$C> <#/>there weren't some really complaints that he can't write and really wants to write <#/>Is it a complaint that he's putting across or is it just at it in a satirical manner <#/>Does it uh does he just want to bring up a humour <#/>Okay as in t
he <-/>the last few stanzas you have to agree on a very critical issue here when not is this a uh the best agents of <-/>of you know conveying this particular love as the major role you know the major role <-_>the major role<-/> things in life like uh

\par <$B> <#/>the wind
\par <$C> <#/>the winds you know the cashew and the coffee trees even he talks about the <-_animal><+_animals> the hyenas and the buffalo so is like uh is like he's <-/>he's making uh some point about education here uh <#/>I wouldn't <-_>I wouldn'
t<-/> really say that uh uh he does not really need this education
\par <$B> <#/>okay
\par <$C> <#/>I think he's part of this pain he's talking about is uh <-/>is as a result of you know lack of his education that perhaps now that he has <-_>he has<-/> <-_>he has<-/
> been uh rejected now that he has not he has been denied this particular education he is not too happy very much happy about it and perhaps is now resorting to another means you know of conveying the same message perhaps even winds will do it better than
 you know the <-/>the <-/>the written message
\par <$B> <#/>uh the nature of the finals of the final line I think it's very emphatic but I can't write to see that oh my hopelessness <#/>I can't write it <#/>I think it's very emphatic <-/>emphatic as to suggest t
hat uh but the way for this guy there is not to have education he feels some form of adoration from <-/>from what perhaps he would like to be or something like that
\par <$C> <#/>now I also want to know really I wanted to bring attention to this particular line
 about the <-/>the addressee in this line the addressee also can't read the addressee can't read <#/>I know we know that the addressee is right <-/>right back in the home country that is in uh <-/>in <-/>in Angola okay <#/>So what <-/>what is your <-/>you
r view about you know the situation of <-/>of the colonised
\par <$B> <#/>no now it <-/>it <-/>it they still would say that
\par <$C> <#/>I would say that uh in this a letter to from a contract worker so I think the trend was that uh these people were not supposed to
 get education because they were supposed to be contract workers <#/>If <-/>if <-/>if perhaps they got education they'll become more critical <#/>They will question the kind of thing within their <-/>their lives <#/>They want to perhaps to have <./>some u
h
 something better than just being mere contract workers <#/>The so in turn you were missing that comes from this pains that uh the <-/>the destiny for <-/>for the uneducated in the context of Portuguese uh colonies was uh to become a contract worker <#/>Y
o
u didn't have to bring anything else what else and this man looks at that kind of thing that kind of <-/>of stereotyping and is what fills him the lot of anguish above on just the fact that he cannot communicate his message of love to <-/>to his lover in 
a letter <#/>It's also that kind of he feels that uh uh this lack of education <O/> him lot and his like I mean the people the other contract workers of the other countries around him
\par <$B> <#/>and I wanted also to bring your attention to this <#/>Okay to me
 it appears as if it is some paradox of some kind who is talking to the person in this case is lamenting that he cannot write yet at the end of the day he's written a poem <#/>What does it mean 
\par <$A> <#/>all he's saying really is his intention
\par <$C> <#/>well you see this is a reflection <-_>is a<-/> reflection of society this poem that is a reflection of society you know you cannot you can't just write what you are not but what you can observe isn't it }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar/tag}{
\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$B> <#/>yeah so he's whoever wrote this poem the <O/> was just uh a reflection on his society was this reflecting on that strains being in society the emotions that go through the minds of people how they feel about the systems
\par <$C> <#/>so <-/>so in <-/>in other words you are saying that uh the <-/>the person in this case is quite <-_>is quite<-/> distanced from the <-/>the poet
\par <$B> <#/>yeah I would say because we know <-_>we know<-/> <-_>we know<-/> the poet <-_>the poet<-/> is Antonio Jacinto
\par <$C> <#/>yeah
\par <$B> <#/>but now he's created he has created a person ..
\par <$A> <#/>yeah this person 
\par <$C> <#/>yeah I
\par <$B> <#/>so it is this I now who is not able to who is not able to write
\par <$A> <#/>yeah <-/>yeah <-/>yeah
\par <$B> <#/>he's just
\par <$C> <#/>so it is now recollecting on <-/>on <-/>on experiences in <-/>in the society
\par <$B> <#/>yeah
\par <$C> <#/>it's just like uh <-/>like you would for example you look around and you see things happen in daily <-_surrounding><+_surroundings> <#/>Some you really feel for them you feel is there something to suffering and you 
feel for him but at one time or another you identify his particular problem in the <-_>in the<-/> particular case you can't write a poem you're even just do it yourself you are sure one person would say <onom/>aye because you also feel that's <-/>that's t
he emotion that caused to <O/> that particular person
\par <$B> <#/>and it's also this other issue <#/>I wanted to bring your attention to okay especially the <-/>the second the last the second last stanza uh the sorrowful words 
of the letter <O/> you <-/>you <-/>you know that uh the words of this poem change from sorrowful
\par <$C> <#/>they really look sorrowful in the <-_>in the<-/> strictest sense of <-/>of the word what <-/>what 
\par <$A> <#/>let's <-/>let's me}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 
tell you just there is a point here the <O/> pitying <?/>or sharp soul from song to song lament to lament would lead to pure and hot the <?/>ban <#/>the sorrowful words are very talented to read to me <#/>I don't know what is the person of the
\par <$B> <#/>oka
y as have you supported the <-/>the person is that acquaints some <-/>some anguish but then he wants to write a <-/>a love poem uh a <-/>a love letter to <-/>to <-/>to the addressee who is way back who is now very far back home uh and now he <-/>he in the
 first stanza he's talks }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 
about this nameless pain and <-/>and now he is talking about you know the <-/>the intimate secrects and in a letter of memories of you <#/>Okay then he goes on to <-/>to discuss the <-/>the nature <-_>the nature<-/> of t
his particular of the <-_>of the<-/> addressee her lips you know the hair the eyes you know the breast all this thing that caresses <#/>Yet I was really wondering towards the end he is talking about the sorrowful words of the letter and you know that thes
e words is he the <-/>the poet is writing or the person is writing are not even sorrowful <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 <#/>So do <-/>do don't you think that is a paradox <-_>a paradox<-/> such a man this 
\par <$C> <#/>I wouldn't really call it a paradox as such
\par <$B> <#/>also we have re
ally established the background of the person that uh he's a contract worker so definitely considering that particular burden of his he's a person with enough problems now for example if you are removed from the people that you really love you at times wa
nt try to <O/> much kind of life time you're going through what <-/>what experiences you're going through
\par <$A> <#/>besides saying
\par <$B> <#/>yeah <#/>I'm certain that uh wherever he is life isn't just that so good the pain that I have known in whatever and th
e conditions of life aren't just very good so is he perhaps he also wanted to say that in the letter to point out to the <-/>the conditions of his life wherever he is in their minds <#/>Okay I'm saying that in the context of this particular poem
\par <$C> <#/>yeah uh because we're realise in the poem that uh is it uh the <-/>the experiences he describes here especially of the <-_>of the<-/> heart
\par <$B> <#/>you know this is <-_>this is<-/> sentimentalising <#/>I would call it you know when you look back at something that you miss and you have your feelings to <-/>to talk about it it's just mere the sentiment of life say you have nice <O/> here what 

\par <$A> <#/>but besides that
\par <$B> <#/>besides that the main point is this guy's a contract worker and that is just what forms the background of the very letter that he wants to write his experiences and even the experiences <-_who><+_which> are well worth writing 
\par <$C> <#/>so all those was supposed to }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$B> <#/>even whereby he's <./>wri he is writing to he does n
ot have any education when he feels I would write a letter that person wouldn't be able to read <#/>See that so I <-/>I using that uh <#/>Okay part <-/>part of what was written in the letter was uh this nameless pain this sorrow
\par <$C> <#/>and I think you know <-_>and I think you know<-/> <-_>you know<-/> these words <-_>these words<-/> are there as I <-_>as I<-/> pointed and are saying to us are }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article> }{\v\fs24\lang2057 
form of sentimentalisation <#/>Now the <-/>the core of it is the emotion the basic emotion that stems 
from the fact that the person is a contract worker you see that I don't know if I get the sense of loneliness and the context in which he works as a contract worker yeah imperialism and colonialism is it and the kind of feelings this system inspires in th
e
 person you see that is what he basically wanted to communicate <#/>These two people are separated because of the system you know that that is the first factor you have to establish <#/>It is a system that has separated him <#/>The Portuguese are selling 
this guy's labour to the person's labour to South Africa
\par <$B> <#/>exactly right
\par <$C> <#/>without his consent
\par <$B> <#/>yeah without his consent
\par <$C> <#/>because I <./>w <-/>I to me I was assuming this poem is this is a letter <#/>It is the letter the person 
had <-/>had set out to write and these are the words of the letter so I had wanted us <-_>I'd wanted us<-/> <#/>Okay <O/> he's saying that these are the sorrowful words of the letter he's noting in a letter which he <-_don't><+_doesn't> <?/>need is such i
n this particular letter which is now in the form of a poem
\par <$B> <#/>I don't think it's this one because he says I wanted <-_>I wanted<-/>
\par <$A> <#/>yeah this is not the letter
\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <}{\v\fs24\lang2057 $C> <#/>is it he hadn't written because he's unable to write
\par <$A> <#/>can't write
\par <$B> <#/>he can't write I wanted <-_>I wanted<-/>
\par <$A> <#/>so that is how 
\par <$C> <#/>his wish
\par <$A> <#/>he always wanted
\par <$B> <#/>you see that is a wish <#/>It is his wish
\par <$A> <#/>then again naturally when somebody writes to you a letter for me really this is a contract worker he's away first he has to talk about have news to you
\par <$C> <#/>yeah <-/>yeah
\par <$A> <#/>my but then again that all I tell how what I'm going through yo
u know all that comprises the letter the contract worker wouldn't just address himself to how he loves the person and all that you know there is much more maybe this is what I'm going through love it I'm away from you this is her is where I am but don't f
orget I still love you and all I want is to write to you a letter }{\fs24\lang2057 </X></I>

\par <$C> <#/><-/>aha
\par <$A> <#/>are not with God since you claimed you are with God and God has guided you to move from that point of disaster to a safer point so you want to tell me that those who perish there are not with God

\par <$A> <#/>Uh
\par <$C> <#/>Yeah <#/>God is so discriminating

\par <$B> <#/>Uh
\par <$C> <#/>Yeah somebody can have that concept of God and you can know that God is there

\par <$C> <#/>but to bother to go to church or why go to church there is no need

\par <$B> <#/><-/>aha
\par <$C> <#/>Sometimes I don't }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\fs24\lang2057  know due to personal reasons or what he declined to comment the

\par <$D> <#/>So you decided not to 
\par <$C> <#/>Me I have come to a point whereby I don't think it is important to <O/> first the principle that the first principle that I have based on my rejection for wedding is that maybe people are taking it to be a kind of a show-off
\par <$B> <#/>Uh
\par <$C> <#/>Somebody wants to display how much
\par <$B> <#/>Uh
\par <$C> <#/>how much <O/> used in the wedding
\par <$B> <#/>Uh
\par <$C> <#/>And now you see it is like a competition such that
\par <$B> <#/>Uh
\par <$C> <#/>When you let's say for my case now if I don't have enough <-_fund><+_funds> to uh spend for the wedding

\par <$D> <#/>That you <-/>you are all Christians and you've been going to church together and now somebody you can even hear somebody I mean

\par <$D> <#/>carrying on some rumour that so and so <O/> this is the way he is that he cannot even hold a wedding he cannot and then they claim to be Christians you know is just to <-/>to diminish others I mean relegate others
\par <$B> <#/>Uh
\par <$D> <#/>while you praise yourself you feel prestigious
\par <$B> <#/>It has become a matter of competition
\par <$D> <#/>Yeah and then }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>overlap}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$D> <#/>They are distorting the meaning of the thing all together }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\fs24\lang2057  <#/>And this thing has discouraged many people from doing their weddings in churches because
\par <$B> <#/>Uh }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$D> <#/>So in my case I don't know that is still a question I put to in suspense }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>overlap}{\fs24\lang2057

\par <$D> <#/>I can use the traditional way which is still fine

\par <$C> <#/>Or you <-/>you wed in }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>Kiswahili}{\fs24\lang2057

\par <$C> <#/>in fact during medieval time the argument is that philosophy is a lot of religion

\par <$C> <#/>Now let's take a case where
by maybe your background at home you see marriages and you see directly what is happening in marriages <#/>You see them breaking up going towards divorce and all that <#/>Why should I look forward to marriage after I've seen all that

\par <$C> <#/>Yeah and I'm not going without that price being big

\par <$A> <#/>culturally I think
\par <$B> <#/>so we should do our road
