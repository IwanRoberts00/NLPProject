\par <$A> <#/>We present A New Book of African Verse a collection of poems edited by John Reed and Cliff
 Waite <#/>This programme is for forms three and four <#/>This is the first of eight programmes on a New Book of African Verse <#/>In this introductory programme we shall be discussing poetry generally <#/>We shall also examine two poems by the late Angol
an President poet Augustino <?/>Netu <#/>In the studio with me are the radio teacher and his two students Njeri and Omolo Welcome to the programme
\par <$B> <#/>Hello students in this lesson we shall deal with poetry generally <#/>We shall also examine two poems
 by Augustino <?/>Netu <#/>Now poetry anthologies can be organised in various ways <#/>For instance a whole collection can be organised by theme <#/>You could have an anthology of humorous poetry <#/>For example this would be a collection of verse by diff
e
rent poets but the connecting link between all these poems would be humour <#/>Each of the <-_poem><+_poems> would be humorous or witty in some way <#/>Similarly you can find <-_collection><+_collections> of love poetry war poetry and so on <#/>Yes Omolo 
I can see you have something to say already <#/>Go ahead
\par <$C> <#/>Besides collections of poetry based on subjects like love and war and so on there are other ways in which poems can be collected in one book <#/>For example my elder sister who enjoys reading
 poetry has two collections of poems by Kenyan poets <#/>One is called Tensions and all the poems in this collection are by a single poet Richard Ntiru <#/>The other is a collection of poems by Michere Mugo and is titled Daughter of My People Sing
\par <$B> <#/
>Good point Omolo <#/>Yes that is another way poetry can be collected together between two covers <#/>As you say all the poems in some collections are by a single poet <#/>Now on what general basis are the poems in A New Book of African Verse collected to
gether
\par <$A> <#/>The title of this collection explains that <#/>All the poems in this collection are by African poets
\par <$B> <#/>Correct all the poems in this book are by poets from our continent <#/>Yes Njeri what do you wish to say
\par <$D> <#/>Well I don't unde
rstand why this book is called A New Book of African Verse <#/>After all there are only two poems from East Africa and both these are by Ugandan poets Taban lo Liyong and Okot p'Bitek <#/>I don't see any poems from Kenya Tanzania Zaire or Malawi
\par <$B> <#/>Y
es that's a relevant objection <#/>Njeri I was a bit disappointed myself to see not a single Kenyan poet represented here and we certainly have some very good poets <#/>It seems that most of the poets in this collection are from South or West Africa Our c
o
untry and our region have been neglected <#/>Did you notice that this collection is titled A New Book of African Verse <#/>Well now this is because though it was published in nineteen eighty-four <#/>It is a revised edition of a book originally published 
i
n nineteen sixty-four <#/>The first edition was titled A Book of African Verse and in that book the editors include the poem Karioki by a Kenyan poet Joseph <?/>Gatueria <#/>That first edition also included two poems by the Malawian poet David Rubadiri wh
o
 has spent many many years in Kenya and Uganda but both these poets have been excluded from A New Book of African Verse <#/>Other poets especially those from South Africa have been included instead <#/>Before we actually start examining individual poems l
et me first ask you students what you understand by poetry <#/>Yes Omolo
\par <$C> <#/>To me poetry is written in lines and verses not in paragraphs as in prose
\par <$B> <#/>Yes uh that's one definition of poetry <#/>A poem is written in lines rather than in continuous sentences and paragraphs as is prose <#/>Njeri any other ideas 
\par <$D> <#/>I have noticed that in poetry the writer often compares things <#/>He will say one thing is like another and that it resembles in some way <#/>For example if the poet is writing a
bout a woman he loves he might compare her to a flower or a jewel or something that is lovely and treasured <#/>In this way he tells us both how beautiful she is and also how dearly he loves her
\par <$B> <#/>Very good Njeri and what do we call this kind of comparison of one thing to another in poetry <#/>Yes Omolo
\par <$C> <#/>We call it a simile
\par <$B> <#/>That's correct <#/>We call comparisons between objects or persons similes <#/>In this way the poet makes clear to us the particular thing or person or feeling he is describing <#/>Omolo what other devices does a poet use
\par <$C> <#/>Sometimes the poet uses sound to make real for us the thing or person he's writing about <#/>For example I have read a poem about a thunderstorm and the poem ends like this
\par <}{\b\fs24\lang2057 quote_><X_>}{\fs24\lang2057  }{\v\fs24\lang2057 as jagged blinding flushes 
\par rumble tremble and crack}{\fs24\lang2057  </X>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 <quote/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <#/>Now a word like jagged makes us see the lightening zigzagging across the sky <#/>Well the sound of words like rumble tremble and crack make us hear the thunder of this storm
\par <$B> <#/>Excellent obs
ervation Omolo <#/>So to summarize we can say that the poet uses various techniques or methods to make his poem vivid and memorable <#/>He uses similes and sounds and images <#/>Now all this becomes clearer to you as we actually read and examine the indiv
i
dual poems but there is one last thing I would like to mention before we start on <?/>Netu's poems <#/>I want you to keep firm in mind that in our study of the poems we shall pay equal attention to theme and style theme and style <#/>Well Njeri what do yo
u understand by theme 
\par <$D> <#/>I think the theme of a poem is its subject matter <#/>It is the main idea that the poet wishes to communicate in that particular poem
\par <$B> <#/>Quite right <#/>The theme refers to the subject matter or content of a poem <#/>It refers to what the poet is saying that is to those feelings and experiences he is trying to tell us about in his poem <#/>Omolo what do you understand by the expre
ssion the style of a poem
\par <$C> <#/>The style of a poem refers to the various methods the poet uses to make his poem fine and memorable <#/>Style refers to the kind of words he selects <#/>These will be the most appropriate words in the particular place in t
he poem where they appear <#/>Style also refers to other poetic devices like rhythm that is the beat of a poem or to the image and similes and sound the poet uses
\par <$B> <#/>You have explained the meaning of a poet's style very clearly <#/>So remember in our
 study of poems we shall emphasise the poet's ideas or themes as much as his style <#/>Okay let us now move on to study two poems by the Angolan poet Augustino <?/>Netu <#/>These poems are on pages forty-nine and fifty of your text <#/>Let us first read h
is poem Between <#/>Njeri will you please read the poem for us <#/>You will find it on page forty-nine
\par <$D> <#/>Between by Augustino <?/>Netu
\par <}{\b\fs24\lang2057 quote_><X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  this distress at being human

\par <$B> <#/>Thank you Njeri <#/>Well what is this poem about <#/>What is the poet saying in Between
\par <$D> <#/>He is saying that human life is made up of pain but also of joy
\par <$B> <#/>Yes human life consists of moments of pain and other moments of happiness <#/>Let us see how the poet expresses his idea <#/>The poem is composed of three verses and <?/>Netu uses each verse to e
xpress a particular idea <#/>Omolo would you like to explain the idea contained in each of the poem's three verses
\par <$C> <#/>In the first verse he says that human beings experience unhappiness and sorrow <#/>In the second verse he shows how they also experi
ence joy <#/>In the final verse he says that despite both this joy and sorrow the continent of Africa can plan a better future for itself and its people
\par <$B> <#/>Very good Omolo <#/>That's very brilliant <#/>Now you have briefly explained what the poet's i
dea and theme are about <#/>Now let us go back to those three verses to see how <?/>Netu expresses his ideas that is we shall now be concentrating on his style <#/>In verse one how particularly does the poet convey the idea of human distress
\par <$D> <#/><?/>Netu uses a horrible image to make us feel the human distress he mentions <#/>The image is of reptiles and worms in a mudhole <#/>They are getting ready to destroy a beautiful human child
\par <$B> <#/>Yes and how are these worms preparing to destroy the child
\par <$D> <#/>The poet doesn't say exactly how but I think he hints that the child will die perhaps of hunger or sickness and then it will be consumed of worms
\par <$B> <#/>Yes the poet doesn't actually specify how the child will die but in that horrible ugly image 
he suggests that it will be destroyed by worms and reptiles <#/>These worms will eat the child after he dies but the reptiles refer to the various evils that children of Africa are exposed to today Evils like hunger and disease <#/>So we have seen how the
 
poet uses images to convey ideas <#/>In this case the image of reptiles and worms explains how life is threatened by pain and evil and sorrow <#/>The reptiles stand for evils like hunger and disease <#/>The worms stand for death and the target of these ev
ils is the innocent child who is destroyed even before he has had a chance to live and experience the goodness life has to offer <#/>Now what about the second verse <#/>How does the poet express that other side of human life its joy <#/>Yes Njeri
\par <$D> <#/>Here the poet uses images like dawn and hymn to express the joy and glory of being human and this happiness defeats the enemies of human life the worms and reptiles
\par <$B> <#/>Yes indeed <#/>The poet expresses the beauty and hope of human existence in images 
like dawn and hymn of earth and this joy this hope is clearly seen in the poet's choice of words and phrases <#/>Omolo select those words and phrases that communicate the deep joy in human existence
\par <$C> <#/>Words like delight dawn sweet and strong resounding intoxication hymn <#/>Through these words the poet tries to show the depth and the intensity of happiness human beings can experience
\par <$B> <#/>Good <#/>Finally in the third verse <?/>Netu is saying that between the good and the evil in life the people of our continent can start to create a new world of hope and harmony <#/>How do we know he's referring to Africa
\par <$D> <#/>He refers to Africa poetically as a great track from the Niger to the Cape
\par <$B> <#/>Yes and how can Africa create this harmony and hope
\par <$C> <#/>We are told how Africa can create this harmony and hope in the third and fourth lines where }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <quote_>}{\fs24\lang2057 <ea_>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 <X_> }{\v\fs24\lang2057 
marimbas and hand drums voices and hands raise in harmony the inaugural hymn of Africa to come}{\fs24\lang2057 </X><ea/>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 <quote/>}{\fs24\lang2057  <#/>That is Africa can create this hope with its hands and its culture
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<$B> <#/>Correct <#/>The mention of <ea/>marimbas and drums probably refers to Africa's culture <#/>Notice how the word hands is repeated <#/>This suggests it's
 through human effort and skill that we create the glorious Africa to come The Africa of unity and joy <#/>Well let us end our lesson today by briefly examining another poem by <?/>Netu <#/>This is on pages forty-nine and fifty and is called Night <#/>Nje
ri please read it for us
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \fs20 {\fs24\lang2057 <$D> <#/>Night by Augustino <?/>Netu 
\par }{\b\fs24\lang2057 <quote_><X_>}{\fs24\lang2057  }{\v\fs24\lang2057 I live in the dark townships of the world
\par without light or life I go down the streets
\par feeling my way 
\par propped on my shapeless dreams
\par stumbling in slavery in my longing to be
\par township slaves walls of misery dark townships
\par where their wills are diluted 
\par and men take one another for things 
\par I go tumbling down the unlit unfamiliar streets
\par blocked with mystery and dread on the arms of ghosts
\par and the night is dark }{\fs24\lang2057 </X>}{\b\fs24\lang2057 <quote/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$B> <#/>Thank you Njeri <#/>Now would you agree with me that this poem isn't as hopeful as Between
\par <$C> <#/>Yes I agree <#/>The poem Night describes how it feels to belong to the deprived and miserable slum <-_township><+_townships> of the world
\par <$B> <#/>Yes but how does <?/>Netu express the hopelessness of life in the slums Omolo
\par <$C> <#/>He does this mainly by the words he uses <#/>For example adjectives like dark unlit and unfamiliar tell us that the slum the speaker lives in lacks electricity and street lights <#/>It is w
ithout light or life so he has to find his way through the slum by feeling his way rather than seeing his way
\par <$D> <#/>He also uses verbs like propped feeling tumbling stumbling and blocked <#/>These words tell us that the slum dweller lacks control over h
is own life <#/>Finally nouns like mystery dread and ghost tell us what frustrates the speaker's plans and dreams <#/>The poet makes an important point in verse four <#/>Here he says that in these miserable slums men take one another for things <#/>That i
s individuals are not respected or accorded their human dignity <#/>Instead they are exploited and used as mere objects
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 <$B> <#/>That's an important point Njeri Now one last thing Look at the first verse Why does the speaker say I live in the dark townships
 of the world After all a man can only live in one particular township in one particular country So how can he be said to live in the townships of the world 
\par <$C> <#/>I think in this poem <?/>Netu is talking not just for Africa as he was in the poem Betwee
n Rather he is speaking for all those across our world who live in deprived conditions who suffer misery and want those millions who lack the most basic needs of human life like decent food shelter and hope
\par <$B> <#/>Very good Omolo Let us stop there for th
is lesson I'd like you to prepare for our next lesson by reading three poems by two South African poets These poems are one The Goldminers by Masisi Kunene on pages thirty-six and thirty-seven two Sword Eulogizing Itself After A Massacre by Masisi Kunene 
on pages thirty-seven and thirty-eight and finally The Island by <?/>Sifo Sempala on page eighty-two

\par <$D> <#/>I now understand }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 It means that your crops went hungry }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 You did not feed them properly
\par <$C> <#/>I did put some manure before planting }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 And I weeded the crop twice
\par <$D> <#/>You see Mr <name/> you need to understand this that crops need a balanced diet just like you and me }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 They need certain food in form of mineral salts }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
These mineral salts are sold as fertilisers }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 If you failed }{\b\v\fs24 <+_to>}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 provide proper fertilisers you will continue to have low yields

\par <$D> }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>laughs}{\fs24  <#/>You're right }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 But they show signs when they are lacking certain minerals }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 For example we have a mineral known as nitrogen }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>pause}{\fs24 
 nitrogen }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 It is a must that a plant has nitrogen for proper growth
\par <$C> <#/>How do I tell that my crop is lacking nitrogen
\par <$D> <#/>A crop lacking nitrogen will have for example leaves which change to yellow and these leaves will be poorly formed }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 The crops will also not be able to grow to the
ir full size and they can easily be attacked by diseases 
\par <$C> <#/>What else am I likely to observe in a crop lacking nitrogen

They will start to die from the tip backwards }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 And in grasses the tips of lower leaves may turn brown }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 This yellow colour will spread along the mid-rib until the whole leaf dies 
\par <$C> <#/>I'm beginning to understand }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Tell me officer after strong wind blew over my maize garden a lot of the plants were left lying flat on the ground }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Why do you think this happened
\par <$D> <#/>I must say that was a good observation }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 It showed that your maize plants had weak stems }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 You see when plants lack nitrogen they develop weak stems }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24

 in grasses lower leaves die slowly from the bottom }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 It is also important to note that nitrogen is needed by plants for the following re
asons one nitrogen encourages vegetative growth two nitrogen gives green colour to the plants and three nitrogen is part of protein }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Class let us now go back to the conversation of Mr <name/> and Mr <name/>
\par <$D> <#/>Another mineral salt which crops need in very very large amounts is phosphorus }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 And this phosphorus is also supplied as fertiliser especially at planting time 
\par <$C> <#/>What are its hunger signs in plants
\par <$D> <#/>Firstly the plants will have slow growth }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Secondly crops lacking phosphorus will take a long time to mature }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Thirdly after harvesting the yields are very low }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Fourthly crops such as maize wheat and barley have thin stems }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 The leaves in maize turn purple in colour 
\par <$C> <#/>And what would you say are the uses of phosphorus in plants
\par <$D> <#/>Phosphorus is important for the proper root development and that is why it must be supplied at planting time }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Phosphorus will speed up maturing of crops such as maize }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
And lastly phosphorus is important for the development of reproductive parts of the plants that is flowers and fruits 
\par <$C> <#/>I wish you had come earlier }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 I would have been smiling now over a good harvest }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>music}{\fs24 
\par <$B> <#/>Class you have learnt that phosphorus is another mineral salt that crops require in very large quantities }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 We have been told that lack of phosphorus in crops will result in the following deficiency symptoms }{
\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Please write them down }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 One slow growth }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>pause}{\fs24  slow growth two slender or thin stalks }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>pause}{\fs24  slender or thin stalks three delayed maturity }{\b\v\fs24 
<&/>pause}{\fs24  delayed maturity four low yields }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>pause}{\fs24  low yields and five purple colour in maize leaves }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>pause}{\fs24  purple colour in maize leaves }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
We've also been told that fertiliser containing phosphorus should be applied at planting time }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
This will help in one development of roots two quick maturing of crops and three development of reproductive parts of the plants mainly flowers and fruits }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Let us now hear more from the conversation between M
r <name/> and Mr <name/>
\par <$D> <#/>There is also another mineral salt that plants need in large quantity }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Your crop of maize must have it to give you better yields 
\par <$C> <#/>Which one is it
\par <$D> <#/>It is called potassium }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Potassium like nitrogen and phosphorus also comes as a fertiliser }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 We are lucky that our soils do not have serious shortages of potassium }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{
\fs24 But where symptoms show you must supply it to the crops in form of fertilisers 
\par <$C> <#/>Which are the symptoms of potassium deficiency on crops
\par <$D> <#/>Lack of potassium in crops will be shown in the following ways }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 One leaves will be half burned and spotted }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Two lower leaves will curl }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Three stems and branches will be weak and often will fall off before maturity }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Four roots and tubers develop poorly }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 And five orange trees will look spotted 
\par <$C> <#/>After preparing charcoal on a piece of my <ea/>shamba the maize planted there did very well }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Do ashes have any mineral 
\par <$D> <#/>What a good observation you made }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Ashes and stalks of cereal crops have a high percentage of potassium }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 But remember burning has more harm }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>idiom}{\fs24  than good on soil }{
\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Burning will kill micro-organisms in the soil }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Extensive burning may cause soil erosion }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Why not use manures and fertilisers recommended for better results }{
\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 We're always there to help you remember }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>music}{\fs24

In today's programme we'll discuss methods of soil conservation }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Welcome to the programme }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>music}{\fs24  
\par <$B> <#/>Soil must be prevented from being carried away by wind and water }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 This is what we mean by the term soil conservation }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 We want to retain the good top soil }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
We need this top soil to grow crops and rear livestock }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 There are many methods used in conserving soil }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Today we shall discuss some of these methods }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
The methods of soil conservation that we shall discuss are one contour farming two strip cropping three terracing four grassed waterways and five gabions }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 In the studio we have a pupil called <name/> }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{
\fs24 <Name/> will be visiting a local farmers' training centre near his school }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 We shall hear him talking to the agricultural instructor in the Institute Mr <name/> }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Now let us listen to what they say about soil conservation methods 
\par <$C> <#/>Good morning Sir
\par <$D> <#/>Good morning to you young man }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 What can I do for you
\par <$C> <#/>My name is <name/> }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 I come from Henny Primary School and I am in class seven 
\par <$D> <#/>Yes I know Henny Primary School very well }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 I know most of the teachers }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 What exactly is your problem }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Do not be afraid }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Feel free with me }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 I'm also a teacher of adults }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 I train farmers 
\par <$C> <#/>Sir we are studying the topic soil conservation methods }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 I would like to know more about these methods of soil conservation }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
As a matter of fact we have been given an assignment to find out more on this topic
\par <$D> <#/>Well well now I understand}{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24  But for you to understand better I suggest we move over to our demonstration farm }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Let's go }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>music}{\fs24  }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Here we are }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Let's stop now }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 We have many methods of soil conservation displayed on this farm }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
But for a start let me hear from you what methods you use at home to conserve the soil 
\par <$C> <#/>Where I come from is very hilly }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 So during cultivation such as digging or weeding we cultivate across the slope }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 For this reason there is little or no loss to our top soil 
\par <$D> <#/>Oh that's beautiful }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Cultivating across the slope is a nice way towards soil conservation }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 It is one of several steps towards soil conservation 
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<$C> <#/>But Sir can you tell me the reason behind cultivating across the slope <#/>What really happens that the soil is prevented from being washed away 
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \fs20 {\fs24 <$D> <#/>You see cultivating across the slopes helps to check the direction and speed of the waterflow }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
This means the water flows slowly and in this way most of the water sinks into the soil }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 If you dug up the slope you'll be making }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar/tense}{\fs24  it easier for the water to flow down easily and very fast }
{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 As it does it carries away a lot of soil the top soil you need }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 But I think the best results can even be got through cultivating along the contours }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
It is more or less similar to what you have described 
\par <$C> <#/>Contour
\par <$D> <#/>Yes contour method of soil conservation }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Why do you sound surprised at my mentioning the word contour }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Have you heard it before 
\par <$C> <#/>Our teacher told us that a contour is a line joining points of the same height above sea level }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Contouring is done by surveyors when mapping an area
\par <$D> <#/>You are very correct }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Therefore cultivation by help of the contour line is called contour cultivation }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>pause}{\fs24  contour cultivation
\par <$C> <#/>But how is this done
\par <$D> <#/>This means that you dig following the contour }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 You also plant your maize or beans or potatoes whatever crop following the contours }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 All this will help to check the waterflow after the rain

\par <$C> <#/>Oh I understand }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 But Sir look at that plot }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 I can see you have planted maize }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Then further down you have sweet potatoes }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Then further down again you have grass pasture }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 What kind of soil conservation method is that
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24 <$D> <#/>What you are seeing and have described is called strip cropping }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>pause}{\v\fs24 
 strip cropping Strip is spelled s t r i p strip In strip cropping plants that give light cover to the soil are alternated by plants that give dense cover and are deep-rooted
 This means that you plant crops giving light cover in one portion then in another portion crop that gives dense cover is planted down the slope You keep on alternating crops giving light cover with those giving dense cover You keep on alternating crops g
iving dense cover on the soil all the way down the slope Grass sweet potato vines green peas lucerne all can provide dense cover to the soil 
\par <$C> <#/>What happens how does this conserve the soil
\par <$D> <#/>All it means is that the soil flowing down the slope is checked or slowed down completely Therefore no soil is washed down the slope Strips should follow the contour for better results }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>music}{\v\fs24 
\par <$B> <#/>Now class <name/> and also <-_yourself><+_yourselves> are beginning to know how to conserve the top soil The agricultural instructor has told us the following methods of soil conservation Please write them down if you haven't }{\b\v\fs24 
<&/>pause}{\v\fs24  Ready }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>pause}{\v\fs24  One of the methods of soil conservation is contour cultivation In this method you cultivate along the contou
r lines This helps to check the speed of the flowing rain water Hence no soil is lost Another method of soil conservation is the strip cropping In this method you alternate crops having light cover on the soil with those having dense cover on the soil Exa
mples of strips are grass sweet potato vines lucerne and green peas Have you written all that Now let's listen to more methods of soil conservation being discussed by <name/> and <name/>
\par <$C> <#/>Look at those long structures like steps What are they Sir
\par <$
D> <#/>Terraces yes What you are looking at now are called terraces You imagine you are standing on a table then you drop onto another table and so on until you are right down the riverside or just like the steps people build to enable them to go up a ste
ep place These particular ones are called bench terraces }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>pause}{\v\fs24  bench terraces Let's go closer for you to see better }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>music}{\v\fs24 
 Here we are you see the making of bench terraces involves reshaping the steep land into several steps This gives the hill the look of stair-shaped plots These steps run across the slope as you can see Crops are grown on the terraces 
\par <$C> <#/>Why do you have grass on the edge of the bench terraces 
\par <$D> <#/>The grass on the edge or bank of a terrace prevents the soil being washed down to the next terrace Notice that you plant crops on the terrace 
\par <$C> <#/>Where do you need bench terraces
\par <$D> <#/>Bench terraces are constructed on a very steep slope 
\par <$C> <#/>What of a gentle slope Can't I have terraces
\par <$D> <#/>Yes you can have terraces on a gentle slope but they are different We have what we call broad-based terraces and narrow-based terraces }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>pause}{\v\fs24  broad-based terraces and narrow-based terraces 
\par <$C> <#/>What is the difference between the broad-based terraces and narrow-based terraces 
\par <$D> <#/>Broad-based terraces are constructed with a wide bank or ridge and a channel Cultivation is carried out both on the ridge and on the channel Now with the narrow-based terrace the bank or ridge is narrower than in the broad-based terrace 
Its bank or ridge is on permanent grass plantation that is no cultivation is carried out on the ridge
\par <$C> <#/>But sir why do you have this wide trench running all the way down the slope at the edge of the terrace 
\par <$D> <#/><-/>Ah I almost forgot that This is called grassed waterway }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>pause}{\v\fs24 
 grassed waterway This waterway receives water from all these terraces The grass on the waterway checks the speed of the water and this prevents soil loss One can use this grass to feed livestock
\par <$C> <#/>So because there is grass growing on the waterway that is why it is called grassed waterway waterway with grass growing on it
\par <$D> <#/>There you are You got it right
\par <$C> <#/>I hope I'm not disturbing you a lot Sir
\par <$D> <#/>Not at all I'm here to help the learners As a matter of fact the more people I teach about soil conservation the happier I become 
\par <$C> <#/>All right I'm sorry for that statement
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {\v <$D> <#/>No no young man I like pupils who ask questions Did you have another question on soil conservation ask
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \fs20 {\v\fs24 <$C> <#/>Yes Sir Tell me other than contour methods strip cropping terracing are there other methods of soil conservation
\par <$D> <#/>There are many more I can tell you one more for today that is building of gabions gabions spelled g a b i o n s gabions Have you heard about gabions before 
\par <$C> <#/>I have heard about gabions but I would like to see how they look like }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>idiom}{\v\fs24 
\par <$D> <#/>Come let's go down over there }{\b\v\fs24 <&>music}{\v\fs24  Here we are this is a gully caused by severe soil erosion We are trying to prevent further loss of the soil 
\par <$C> <#/>How do you do that
\par <$D> <#/>First you put a wire box at the gully bottom Secondly you fill the wire box with stones to form a barrier This barrier will limit the movement of the soil carried away by rainwater as it flows down
 the slope Eventually we shall fill this gully with soil and start growing crops So my friend this is what we call gabions 
\par <$C> <#/>But Sir from your description of the term gabions am I right to call them porous dams 
\par <$D> <#/>You're quite right Porous dams are the same as gabions For now and as I promised we'll stop there Next time you come we shall discuss other methods of soil conservation
\par <$C> <#/>I'm very grateful to you Sir
\par <$D> <#/>Thank you and uh you are always welcome }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>music}{\v\fs24 
\par <$B> <#/>From tha
t conversation you have learned some methods of soil conservation These methods are one contour farming This means you cultivate and grow crops following the contours Two strip cropping In this method you alternate crops having a light soil cover with tho
se having dense cover of the soil Three terracing This is reshaping the land that is hilly into several steps running across the slope Four grassed waterways These are waterways with grass growing on them And five gabions }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>music}{\v\fs24

\par <$C> <#/>Uh I can see some people taking tea and <ea/>mandazi in a kiosk 
\par <$B> <#/>Oh yes }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 You are very observant <name/> }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Now selling of bananas and selling tea and <ea/> mandazi are business activities 
\par <$C> <#/><-/>Aha I understand }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Then if selling bananas and selling tea and <ea/>mandazi are business activities then all this market is full of different kinds of business activities 
\par <$B> <#/>You are right <name/> }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 This market is full of different kinds of business activities 
\par <$C> <#/>Then what would you say about that man over there pulling a <ea/>mkokoteni and that other man there repairing shoes
\par <$B> <#/>Well <name/> that man pulling a <ea/>mkokoteni is in a business activity }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 The man repairing shoes is also in a business activity }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Pulling a <ea/>mkokoteni repa

\par <$B> <#/>Very well <name/> listen carefully then }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 A customer is a person who buys things from other people }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 For example when you buy something from a shop you are a customer of that shop }{
\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 If you buy a blanket from that man then you are a customer of that man }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 So the man who is ringing the bell is trying to attract customers to come and buy his blankets 
\par <$C> <#/><-/>Aha I understand now }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Then that shop over there has very many customers buying from it 
\par <$B> <#/>You are right <name/> }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>T}{\fs24 hat shop over there has very many customers buying from it 
\par <$C> <#/>But the owner of the shop is not ringing a bell to attract customers }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Why are there so many customers attracted to that shop
\par <$B> <#/>Well <name/> I think the best thing to do is to go there and find out }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Let\rquote s go to that shop and find out why there are so many customers }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 I know the owner of the shop }{
\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 His name is Mr <name/> }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Let us go }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>noises}{\fs24  }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 How are you Mr <name/> 
\par <$D> <#/>I am quite fine <ea/>mwalimu }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Is there anything I can sell to you and your pupil }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 I have many things in this shop }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
I have sodas biscuits sweets bread and a lot of other things 
\par <$B> <#/>Well Mr <name/> we are not buying anything just now }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 <Name/> and I are trying to see the business activities taking place in this shopping centre }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
<Name/> noticed that your shop has very many customers }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 She wants to know what you do to attract so many customers 
\par <$D> <#/><ea/>Mwalimu I\rquote ll be very happy to explain to your pupil why many customers come to buy in this shop }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Most customers come to this shop to buy because I have kept many of the things they need }{\fs24\lang2057 
<#/>}{\fs24 As you can see my shop is well stocked with different kinds of goods }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 By stock I mean the items that are kept in the shop for selling 
\par <$C> <#/>Yes I can see that your shop is really well stocked with goods }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 What else do you do to attract customers 
\par <$D> <#/>Well <name/> if you look at the things in this shop I have marked out their prices }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 I normally sell my goods at fair prices }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 So many customers find goods a bit cheaper in my shop }{
\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Another thing I do to attract customers is to give them a discount }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 When customers buy goods from my shop I give them a discount }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
That is how I attract my customers and that is why they keep coming 
\par <$C> <#/>Is there anything else that you do to attract customers
\par <$D> <#/><-/>Ah yes of course }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 One thing about customers is that they like honest and friendly shop-keepers }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
If customers discover that a shop-keeper is dishonest and unfriendly then the customers will run away from such a shop-keeper }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 So being kind and friendly is another way of attracting customers 
\par <$C> <#/>You are a very wise business man Mr <name/> }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Where did you learn all these methods of attracting customers 
\par <$D> <#/>All these things I learned them in school }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 I learned them in business education classes }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
You are very lucky <name/> because your teacher is now teaching you business education in your school }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 When you leave school maybe you\rquote ll start a business like mine of keeping a shop 
\par <$C> <#/>Yes and if I start a business like yours I will do just like you are doing sell things at fair prices be honest and friendly to customers and give them discounts 
\par <$B> <#/>Now that you have mentioned something about starting a business Mr <name/> perhaps you could tell <name/> how you started this business of yours 
\par <$D> <#/>Well it is a long story }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 As I have told you I was taught business education in school }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 It is this knowledge which I gained from school that helped me to start the business }{\fs24\lang2057 
<#/>}{\fs24 But for me to start a business money was required }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 You cannot start a business without money 
\par <$C> <#/>How did you get the money Mr <name/> 
\par <$D> <#/>To start my business I got money from different sources }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 I got a loan from the bank }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 I sold some of the property I had and all that I added to my savings }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Al
l that money enabled me start this business of shop-keeping 
\par <$C> <#/>I think it is a big job to keep a big shop like this one with all that stock }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Do you really know how much stock you have in the shop Mr <name/> 
\par <$D> <#/>Yes <name/> a good shop-keeper and in fact a good business man keeps a record of all the things in a business }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 As for me I keep a record of all the things you see in the shop }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
In fact I keep a record of the things which I buy and a record of all the things which I sell }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Everyone should know that it is very important to keep a record for your business }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
Without a written record it would be difficult to remember anything about your business
\par <$B> <#/>Thank you very much Mr <name/> for what you have told us about your business <name/> and I will return to school }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 <Name/> let us return to school }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 
But I want us to pass near that other shop over there which seem to be having only one customer }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>noises}{\fs24 
\par <$E> <#/>You have given me the wrong change }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\fs24 Why I bought goods worth shillings forty-nine <#/>My change should be fifty-one shillings but you have given me forty-five shillings <#/>Give me my correct change
\par <$F> <#/>What\rquote s wrong with you women <#/>Your change is forty-five shillings and that is all 
\par <$E> <#/>You are cheating me <#/>My change is fifty-one shillings <#/>If you are not giving me my change of fifty-one shillings then take back your goods and give me my money back <#/>I\rquote 
m going to buy from another shop <#/>You are a dishonest shop-keeper 
\par <$F> <#/>Listen to me woman <#/>Once goods are sold from this shop they are not returnable <#/>So take your things away and go away before I lose my temper 
\par <$E> <#/>You are a very rude shop-keeper <#/>You are not honest <#/>You overcharge <#/>I will never buy anything from this shop again }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>noise}{\fs24 
\par <$B> <#/><Name/> let us also go away <#/>This shop-keeper is not a good business person <#/>He is very unfriendly to his customers <#/>I am happy we are far away from that man\rquote s shop <#/>He is rude to his customers <#/>Anyway we have le
arned something from him <#/>Let us talk about our day in the shopping centre <#/>We have spent a very busy day in the shopping centre <#/>Let us try to remember what we have learned from the shopping centre <#/>One of the things we have learned is that t
here are many types of business activities <#/>Can you remember some of those business activities 
\par <$C> <#/>Yes I can remember selling bananas and vegetables pulling <ea/>mkokoteni repairing shoes selling tea and <ea/>mandazis in a kiosk are all business activities 
\par <$B> <#/>That is correct selling bananas and vegetables selling tea and <ea/>mandazi pulling <ea/>mkokoteni and repairing shoes are all business activities <#/>Now <name/> if you keep a business of your own what would you do to attract customers 
\par <$C> <#/>I would do like Mr <name/> <#/>I would sell my goods at a fair price and not overcharge like the bad shop-keeper we saw 
\par <$B> <#/><-/>Aha 
\par <$C> <#/>I would be honest and friendly to my customers <#/>I would also keep the things which the customers need and display them well 
\par <$B> <#/>That is correct <name/> <#/>To attract customers goods should be displayed well and prices should be fair <#/>Being friendly and honest giving discounts are all good ways of attracting customers <#/>What do you think 
of the second shop-keeper <name/> 
\par <$C> <#/>I think the second shop-keeper did not learn business education at all <#/>That is perhaps the reason why he did not know how to attract customers 
\par <$B> <#/>That is very good <name/> <#/>Tell me now what would you do to enable you to know about all the things in a business 
\par <$C> <#/>Keep records <#/>I would keep a record of everything I have in my business 
\par <$B> <#/>Correct <name/> <#/>For every business a written record is very important <#/>Without a written rec
ord one cannot know everything about the business <#/>Let me now summarise what we have learned from the visit to the shopping centre <#/>At the market centre we saw different business activities taking place there <#/>Examples are selling of bananas and 
v
egetables pulling of <ea/>mkokoteni and repairing shoes selling tea and <ea/>mandazi in a kiosk keeping a shop <#/>All those are business activities <#/>Secondly we met a shop-keeper who explained to us about how to start a business <#/>We learned that to
 
start a business money is needed <#/>Some sources of money are loans from banks and personal savings <#/>Thirdly after a business has been started one must attract customers <#/>Some ways of attracting customers are keeping what the customers need selling
 
goods at fair prices giving discounts being honest and friendly to the customers and displaying the goods in a good way <#/>For every business a record must be kept <#/>Without a written record it would be difficult to remember everything about a business
 <#/>And finally skills and knowledge learnt through business education will enable us to become good business men and business women }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>music}{\fs24

\par <$B> <#/>Hello standard-six pupils <#/>Today we shall be talking about importance and sources of money <#/>So I want you to listen carefully to our discussion <#/>Now <name/> last time I asked you to go and ask your grandfather to tell you how peop
le traded long time ago <#/>Did you do that
\par <$C> <#/>Yes teacher I did 
\par <$B> <#/>And what did he tell you 
\par <$C> <#/>He told me that people used to exchange goods for other goods 
\par <$B> <#/>Did your grandfather explain to you what is meant by exchanging goods for goods 
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<X_>}{\v 
<$C> <#/>Yes he did My grandfather explained by using examples He told me that if for example a man wanted to buy a cow from another man then the owner of the cow would ask to be given say five goats 
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \fs20 {\v\fs24 
<$B> <#/>Yes that is what is called exchanging goods for goods The owner of the cow would exchange the cow for goods Did your grandfather give any other examples to explain how people exchanged goods for goods 
\par <$C> <#/>Yes my grandfather gave me another example of blacksmiths 
\par <$B> <#/><-/>Aha and did your grandfather tell you who the blacksmiths are 
\par <$C> <#/>Yes he did Blacksmiths are the people who make spears knives and other things out of metal The blacksmiths would exchange what they had made with wh
at they did not have They would exchange their tools for milk or maize honey or skins and hides or even bananas 
\par <$B> <#/>That is good <name/> Your grandfather gave you very useful information People long time ago traded with each other by exchanging goods
 for goods In those days exchanging goods for goods was a good method of trade It made it possible for a person to have what he or she did not have This method of trade is called barter trade Barter trade is the trade where goods are exchanged for other g
oods Now tell me <name/> do you think that the barter method of trade was a good method of trade 
\par <$C> <#/>No teacher I don\rquote t think the barter method of trade was good I think it had problems 
\par <$B> <#/>Can you suggest some of the problems 
\par <$C> <#/>I think it was not possible to divide into smaller units the things which were to be exchanged 
\par <$B> <#/>You are right <name/> The barter trade had difficulties as you have said It was not possible to divide cows or goats into smaller units Therefore barter trade made buying and selling difficult }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>music}{\v\fs24 
 These days barter trade is not common That is to say people do not use the barter trade method very often They use money to buy what they don\rquote t have 
\par <$C> <#/>But excuse me teacher 
\par <$B> <#/>Yes please 
\par <$C> <#/>Is it possible to define what you mean by money What I mean to ask is what is money 
\par <$B> <#/>Very well <name/> money is what we use to buy things we don\rquote t have Money can be in form of notes and coins In Kenya there is the one-hundred-shilling note the fif
ty-shilling note the twenty-shilling note the ten-shilling note and the five-shilling note There is also a five-shilling coin the one-shilling coin the fifty-cent coin the ten-cent coin and the five-cent coin The use of money is more common these days tha
n the use of barter trade Tell me now <name/> which one do you think is better using money to buy goods or exchanging goods for other goods 
\par <$C> <#/>I think money is better and easier to use 
\par <$B> <#/>That is correct It is easier to use money when buying or selling something than by exchanging goods for goods So money is very important because it makes buying and selling easier 
\par <$C> <#/>Then how can one get money What are the sources of money 
\par <$B> <#/>Well <name/> there are many different sources of money We have discussed one source of money earlier on That is the time when we visited our local shopping centre Do you remember what we saw at the shopping centre 
\par <$C> <#/>Yes I remember we saw different business activities taking place 
\par <$B> <#/>That is rig
ht <name/> We saw many different business activities taking place at the shopping centre One source of money is from the profits made in a business A business can be a source of money During our visit to the shopping centre we talked to Mr <name/> the sho
p-keeper Do you remember that <name/> 
\par <$C> <#/>Yes I remember 
\par <$B> <#/>Good during that visit Mr. <name/> explained to us some of the sources where he got money to start his business Can you remember some of the sources of money he mentioned 
\par <$C> <#/>Yes Mr <name/> said that he got some of the money from the bank that is the bank gave him a loan He also said that he had saved some money and that friends also gave him a loan 
\par <$B> <#/><-/>Aha I am glad you are able to remember all that All thos
e things you have said that is loan from banks personal savings and loans from friends are all sources of money Now let us think about the people in the rural areas Most people in the rural areas make money through farming They get the money for their dai
ly needs from selling the things they grow Do you know the kind of people I am talking about <name/> 
\par <$C> <#/>Yes you are talking about the farmers 
\par <$B> <#/>Correct I am talking about farmers Farmers can get money by selling the things they grow If a farm
er grows more maize than he needs then he can sell the surplus For example if a farmer has a surplus of maize then it means that he has more maize than he needs So the farmer can sell the surplus in order to get money Can you think of another source of mo
ney 
\par <$C> <#/>Yes I can People like you are employed employment is a source of money 
\par <$B> <#/>Yes I am a teacher and teachers are employed People who are employed have the employment as their source of money }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>music}{\v\fs24  Let me now go over again over the poin
ts we have discussed on importance and sources of money Do you remember how our discussion started <name/> 
\par <$C> <#/>Yes our discussion started by explaining why money is important 
\par <$B> <#/>Yes we started by talking about the importance of money Money is 
very important in trade It is easier to use money when buying or selling something We compared barter trade which did not use money with trade which uses money That is we compared barter trade with trade using money We found that money makes buying and se
lling convenient Buying and selling becomes easy But we found that barter trade has many difficulties Can you remember some of the difficulties <name/> 
\par <$C> <#/>Yes I can If you are dealing with barter trade you can have difficulties carrying all the thing
s you want to exchange for other things Some of the goods used in barter trade such as milk bananas cannot be kept for a long time But you can keep money for a long time 
\par <$B> <#/>That is correct <name/> I am glad you can remember some of the difficulties with barter trade What did we say was the other problem with barter trade 
\par <$C> <#/>With barter trade it was not possible to say the correct price of the thing being sold 
\par <$B> <#/>Yes When using money it is possible to say the price to be paid for somethi
ng With barter trade it was more difficult to say the price of something That is why money is very important in buying and selling We also said what money was And we also said money can be in coins and notes After talking about importance of money we then
 discussed the sources of money What are some of the sources of money <name/> that we talked about 
\par <$C> <#/>We said that farming can be a source of money A farmer can get money by selling surplus of his farm produce for example maize beans vegetables fruits and even milk 
\par <$B> <#/><-/>Aha farming can be a source of money A person can sell the surplus of his or her farm produce and get money for the daily needs What other source of money did we discuss 
\par <$C> <#/>A business is another source of money If you have a business you can use some of the profits from the business A business man can use some of the money from the profits of his business to buy what he does not have 
\par <$B> <#/>Yes a business can be a source of money A businessman can get money for his daily needs from the profits he makes in his business Do you remember any other sources of money we talked about 
\par <$C> <#/>Yes I do a person can borrow a loan from a bank or friends And for the people who are employed their monthly salaries are their source of money
\par <$B> <#/>Very good <name/> keep remembering that During this lesson we have talked about the importance of money and the sources of money }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>music}{\v\fs24

\par <$A> <#/>We present oral narratives for forms three and four <#/>This is the first of eight programmes on oral narratives <#/>In this introductory programme we shall discuss the stylistic aspects of oral narratives <#/>With me in the stud
io is a panel of oral literature students <#/>Welcome to the programme
\par <$B> <#/><name/> can you start us off by telling the listener what oral literature is
\par <$A> <#/>Oral literature can be defined as those utterances whether the spoken recited or sung but whose composition and performance shows some artistic characteristics
\par <$B> <#/>Why do you describe oral literature as artistic
\par <$A> <#/>Oral literature is artistic in that the performer must show some accurate observation vivid imagination and ingenious expression during performance
\par <$B> <#/>If oral literature means those words that are composed and performed through the spoken word or by word of mouth what is the relationship between oral and written literature <#/>How can literature be oral
\par <$C> <#/>We ca
ll narratives proverbs recitations songs and other forms of oral performance as literature because like the written literature they use language as the medium of communication <#/>Also like written literature oral performances are artistic <#/>They are in
tended to move us by appealing to both our understanding and our feelings <#/>The written literature also does this by presenting us with well observed characters situations or incidents and by using language effectively to communicate to us
\par <$B> <#/>Does that therefore mean that we analyse oral literature in the same way as we analyse written literature
\par <$C> <#/>That's right <#/>There are certain stylistic features that are common in both written and oral literature but in oral literature we must always remember that the basic expression is the spoken word
\par <$B> <#/>What stylistic aspects are common in both written and oral literature
\par <$C> <#/>Structure language and characters are some of the stylistic aspects found in both oral and written literature
\par <$B> <#/>Today we are dealing with oral narratives <#/>What can you say is the basic structure of oral narratives
\par <$A> <#/>Narratives are told in prose <#/>Normally narratives are longer and more elaborate than the other genres of oral literature <#/>A narrative tells a story and a story has a sequence of events
\par <$B> <#/>Is there any technical term to refer to this series of events
\par <$A> <#/>Yes the series of events in a narrative are called plot <#/>In most oral narratives the plot is very simple <#/>The events occur in a straight line one after another <#/>But in other narratives the plot is very complex
\par <$B> <#/>What is a complex plot
\par <$C> <#/>A narrative may have two or more plots running side by side or at the same time <#/>You may also find a narrative that co
mbines a number of stories <#/>A narrator can do this to create suspense in the audience <#/>He may also create suspense by repeating certain events
\par <$B> <#/>Is the repetition you are talking about confined only to the plot of the narrative
\par <$C> <#/>Not at
 all <#/>We also get certain expressions repeated <#/>For example a narrator may say he walked and walked and walked then he sat down to rest and he rested and rested and rested <#/>This repetition shows us the extent of the character's tiredness <#/>It a
lso establishes the amount of time the walking and the resting takes place
\par <$B> <#/>Many oral narratives begin with phrases like once upon a time a long long time ago a certain man or woman once in a certain place once there lived and many others <#/>What do you call such phrases and what's their role in oral narratives
\par <$A> <#/>Phrases that appear in almost all narratives in the same form are called stock phrases Stock phrases are used as stylistic devices in oral narratives <#/>Phrases like once upon a time introduces }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 the narrative <#/>It also draws the audience to the world of fiction or to the remote past <#/>The narrator would convey the events as they occur in the narrative by using phrases such as then after that
\par <$B> <#/>Talking about stock phrases reminds me of those characters who appear in most narratives <#/>For example the hare the hyena and the tortoise are the commonly used animal characters in most communities in Kenya
\par <$A> <#/>Among the Luhya of Western Kenya the girl <name/>Simbi is the most common human character in the narratives and among the Luo it is the boy <name/>Obongo
\par <$B> <#/>What you call such characters
\par <$C> <#/>Characters who dominate narratives are called stock characters <#/>The hare or the hyena who dominate Kenyan narratives are stock characters <#/>Also <name/>Simbi in Luhya narratives and <name/>Obongo in Luo narratives are stock characters
\par <$B> <#/>What are the functions of characters in narratives
\par <$A> <#/>As we have just said characters in oral narratives can be human beings animals monsters rocks plants spirits or gods <#/>They are usually used to reflect certain qualities like generosity or selfishness wit or
 stupidity humility or vanity <#/>Spirits and divine characters represent the supernatural forces <#/>Because the characters in narratives represent certain values we technically refer to that aspect of style as symbolism <#/>We can say for example such a
nd such a character symbolises such and such a thing
\par <$B> <#/>We talk about the interaction of characters in the narratives <#/>How do the characters interact
\par <$C> <#/>Characters in narratives interact through their speeches and actions <#/>In many narratives characters have direct conversation between them <#/>This is also regarded as an aspect of style in oral narratives <#/>It is called the use of dialogue

\par <$A> <#/>But there is something more on this <#/>Sometimes a character is said to be talking loudly 
to himself or he may be debating on what to do in his mind <#/>This aspect of a character talking to himself is called monologue <#/>It is a common stylistic feature in oral narratives
\par <$B> <#/>We have talked about the use of dialogue and monologue in oral narratives <#/>What can you say about the use of song in oral narratives
\par <$A> <#/>Songs are commonly used in oral narratives <#/>Their usage can be said to be another aspect of style in oral narratives
\par <$B> <#/>I believe that songs serve certain purposes in different narratives <#/>What are some of these functions
\par <$C> <#/>Songs have four main functions in oral narratives <#/>Firstly they usually reinforce the themes in the narratives and offer comments on the events and characters <#/>Secondly songs may a
ct as a means of communication between characters in the narratives <#/>Thirdly they create mood in the narratives <#/>The mood will be conveyed or carried in the narrator's voice <#/>For example if the story is sad we expect a depressed mood in the song 
<#/>Finally songs break the monotony of narration
\par <$B> <#/>We can then say that song is a device that helps in sustaining the audience's attention <#/>But is song the only method of sustaining the audience's attention
\par <$A> <#/>No the narrator can also sustain the audience's attention by asking questions or repeating certain sections of the story or repeating the songs during narration <#/>This creates suspense <#/>It is also a stylistic feature of oral narratives

\par <$B> <#/>Let us now discuss the stylistic features which are closely related to performance <#/>How are the narration sessions introduced
\par <$C> <#/>Different communities have different ways of introducing their narration sessions <#/>For example among my people the Luo the session of narration is intr
oduced by the narrator saying <ea/><O/> <#/>This means let the house go gracing let the house go to the end let the house come to the middle let the house be silent
\par <$B> <#/>I'm sure everybody will listen and wait for the narrative after this announcement <#/>What happens next
\par <$C> <#/>The narrator then introduces the narrative by asking <ea/> can I tell you a story and the audience replies <ea/> tell us a story <#/>He then begins the story <#/>Among the Akamba community the general opening formula is alway
s the same <#/>Whenever a narrator is telling a story to many people he or she would begin this way <ea_><O/> <#/>You take a story and the audience would say <ea/><O/> we have taken <#/>But if the narrator is telling a story to an individual he would say 
<ea/><O/> take a story and the listener would respond <ea/><O/> I have taken
\par <$A> <#/>The Agikuyu }{\b\v\fs24 <&_>Kikuyu people<&/>}{\fs24  start their narration in this way <#/>The narrator would say <ea/><O/> I am going to tell you a story and the audience would respond <ea/
><O/> tell us <#/>This is when the narrator is telling the story to many people <#/>When he is telling the story to one person he begins like this <ea/><O/> I am going to tell you a story and the listener would say <ea/><O/> tell me
\par <$B> <#/>In the three e
xamples you have given us we've noticed that the opening formula is simple and straight forward <#/>The narrator uses a stock phrase or formula to alert the audience that he's going to tell them a story <#/>The audience in turn acknowledges their readines
s to listen to the story <#/>How does the Kiswahili speaker start her narration
\par <$C> <#/>The Kiswahili narrator starts the narration session like this <ea/><O/>
\par <$B> <#/>You've given us the opening formulas of oral narratives from four communities <#/>Do these communities also have closing formulas
\par <$C> <#/>Yes among the Luo the closing formula goes like this <ea/> which means the end <#/>May I grow as tall as my uncle's tree <#/>It is important to note that this formula marks the end of just one narrative
\par <$B> <#/>Does that mean that there is another formula to mark the end of the whole narrative session
\par <$A> <#/>Yes
\par <$B> <#/>How does it go
\par <$A> <#/>I got this formula from the anthology Keep My Words by <name/>Oniango <name/>Ogutu and <name/>Rosku <#/>It goes <ea/> which means tale end at bedroom tale end at door tale end at bedroom tale end at ledge
\par <$C> <#/>The Akamba use different closing formulas depending on the theme and the moral of the narrative <#/>Usually the formula is in the form of a proverb or a
 wish <#/>It is important to note that the proverb or the wish is expressed after the narrator has ended her narration by a stock formula like this and that is the end of my story or my story ends there
\par <$B> <#/>Could you tell us some of the wishes the Akamba story teller may express at the end of the narration
\par <$C> <#/>Depending on the mood or nature of the story a narrator may use one of the following wishes <#/>May you become rich in vermin in your provisions shed but I in cows in my cattle kraal or may 
your cattle eat earthen mud but mine the good grass or you'd better swing with the tail of the panther while I swing with that of a sheep
\par <$B> <#/>What is the meaning of the wishes which come at the end of a narration
\par <$A> <#/>They pose a challenge to the audience <#/>The Akamba narrator is to be better off than her listeners <#/>For example a sheep's tail is fat and edible and the audience had better learnt to tell stories themselves so that they can eat a tail of a s
heep
\par <$B> <#/>I'd like to add that some closing formulas can be meant for jokes just like the stories are meant for entertainment <#/>They can also reflect the practices of a given community <#/>Some of the closing formulas are one and that is the end of my
 story two they remained three and to this day it is on record <#/>It is important to note that while not all communities have opening formulas during their narration sessions the formula closing a narrative occurs in most African communities <#/>So far y
ou have not said anything about the role of the narrator in a narration session <#/>What is her role
\par <$C> <#/>The narrator plays a central role in the narration <#/>A good narrator will make the narrative lively by using physical gestures like nodding point
ing a finger or just holding his cheeks <#/>He can also vary his voice and facial expressions show agony or joy anger or happiness
\par <$B> <#/>Why is it necessary for a story teller to use gestures or vary his voice
\par <$C> <#/>It is usually for the purpose of imitating the characters in the narrative <#/>It is part of performance
\par <$A> <#/>In fact I'm reminded of a popular story my grandmother narrated to me some time back <#/>In this story Hare burns Elephant to death by pretending to make him shoes <X_> }{\v\fs24 <#/>When Ele
phant complains Hare scolds him saying <ea/><O/> the narrator will lisp as the hare <ea/><O/> <#/>This means <ea/><O/> so your size is just that of bubbles
\par <$B> <#/>What do we call this aspect of style in the performance
\par <$A> <#/>When a narrator imitates t
he actions and the <-_speeches><+_speech> of characters in a narrative this aspect of performance is called dramatisation <#/>Imitating characters sometimes causes amusement <#/>It creates a comic effect <#/>This comic effect is an aspect of style called 
humour
\par <$C> <#/>I'd like to add that there is usually a close relationship between the narrator and the audience <#/>At times the audience may even remind the narrator of a point he has missed in the narrative <#/>The audience may also join in the singing o
f a song in a familiar narrative}{\fs24 </X>}{\v\fs24

<$B> <#/>You have been listening to a form three and four programme on oral narratives entitled Stylistic Aspects of Oral Narratives <#/>In this introductory programme we said that one narratives are told in prose and are l
onger and more elaborate than the other genres of oral literature <#/>Two most oral narratives have a simple plot <#/>Three in oral narratives suspense is created by repeating certain words or phrases or songs <#/>Four phrases that appear in almost all na
r
ratives in the same form are called stock phrases <#/>We also said some communities had stock characters because these characters are found in nearly every narrative in that community <#/>Examples are the hare the hyena and the tortoise <#/>Five character
s
 in oral narratives are used to reflect certain qualities in real life like generosity selfishness wit stupidity humility or vanity <#/>Six oral narratives use dialogue and monologue to enable communication between characters Seven we said that songs in o
r
al narratives have four main functions <#/>They reinforce the theme of the narrative they are used as a means of communication between characters in the narrative they create mood and finally they break the monotony of narration <#/>We said that different
 
communities have different ways of introducing and closing their narration sessions <#/>Finally we said that successful story telling depends on the performance of the narrator <#/>His or her ability to use artistic skills to involve the audience fully in
 the narration

>With me in the studio are the radio teacher and his two students <#/>Welcome to the programme
\par <$B> <#/>Hello students <#/>Last week we discussed the stylistic aspects of oral narratives <#/>In that programme we mentioned briefly the role of performance in
 oral narratives <#/>Today we are going to discuss in detail the role of performance in oral literature and especially in the areas of oral narratives songs proverbs and riddles <#/>In particular we shall try to answer these questions <#/>One who undertak
e
s these performances <#/>Two when and where are they performed <#/>Three who listens to them and four for what purposes are oral performances undertaken <#/>As we answer these questions we will inevitably discuss the roles of the oral artist and his audie
nce in a live performance <#/>Let us start with the narratives <#/><Name/> would you like to start us off by telling us who tells the stories
\par <$D> <#/>Yes oral narratives are told and retold by anybody in the community men women children and even elders <#/>Anybody who can tell a story is asked to do so
\par <$C> <#/>May I add that some people tell stories more dramatically than others <#/>Such narrators are recognised and appreciated by the community for their art <#/>They can therefore be regarded as professionals
\par <$B> <#/>You are right <#/>In Kenya we have professional story tellers except that they are not paid for telling stories <#/>This is unlike in some parts of Africa especially West Africa where professional narrators travel from village to village telli
ng stories and living off their art <#/>In some cases they are paid handsomely <name/> could you tell us who tells which stories
\par <$D> <#/>The elders and a section of adults usually tell myths and legends <#/>This is because myths and legends contain abstra
ct ideas that are not really for children <#/>On the other hand children usually enjoy telling folk tales especially trickster narratives and even within this class there are narratives that children enjoy telling each other most
\par <$B> <#/>You are right <na
me/> <#/>Narratives are never told at random <#/>There is always selection <#/>Selection on the basis of subject matter and audience <#/>Elders tell narratives of a serious nature while others are left to relate those that are light hearted or humorous <#
/>Let us now look at how narratives are told <#/><Name/> take that
\par <$C> <#/>In some communities people take turns to tell stories <#/>This is true of the Agikuyu }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&_>Kikuyu people<&/>}{\fs24\lang2057  Luhya Luo Meru and Akamba communities <#/>Amongst the Akamba people for e
xample people sit in a circle and each one present tells a story in turns <#/>In such cases there is equal chance for everybody to tell a story
\par <$B> <#/>Thank you <name/> <#/>If in such a situation one is not able to tell a story he or she is not highly regarded or rated <#/>Yes <name/> you have something to add
\par <$D> <#/>In other communities the people just sit together in a group in an open field or ground and one person tells stories to the crowd
\par <$B> <#/>That is true <name/> <#/>Story telling is seen as a communal and public activity <#/>Anyone tells a story at a social occasion <#/>Let us ask <name/> to tell us where the stories are told
\par <$C> <
#/>As we have already implied in the past in some communities stories were told on open grounds in the village where all people were gathered <#/>These open grounds however were not only reserved for story telling <#/>They were communal meeting places whe
re most social activities took place <#/>In other communities these stories were told in houses where the various groups of people were gathered
\par <$B> <#/>Correct <name/> <#/>Some stories are told in the grandmother's hut <#/>Others are told in huts where the boys or girls sleep or places where children are gathered
\par <$C> <#/>We found out that amongst the Luo community the stories are told in <ea/> where the boys sleep or <ea/> where the girls sleep <#/>Here the girls or boys tell each other stories
\par <$B> <#/>Let us now look at when stories are told <#/><Name/> when are stories told and why are they told at that specific time
\par <$D> <#/>As we mentioned earlier on stories are told in the evening <#/>In fact in most communities it is considered bad and even a taboo to tell a story during the day <#/>For example in some sections of the Abaluhya }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 
<&_>Luhya people<&/>}{\fs24\lang2057  it is believed that if you tell stories during the day you will never grow tall <#/>Height is then seen as a mark of beauty
\par <$C> <#/>And there is a reason for these kinds of beliefs myths if you like <#/>The community wants to discourage its members from sitting down and telling stories during the day while the daily chores are left unattended to
\par <$B> <#/>You are right <#/>Stories are told in the evenings ar
ound seven or later and always after supper <#/>And it serves another good purpose <#/>In the evenings the people are idle and since the stories are often captivating they're a form of entertainment <#/>They serve the same purpose as our TVs videos films 
and music halls serve <#/>Now tell us to whom the stories are delivered
\par <$D> <#/>In most communities women and children tell and will be told fictional stories
\par <$B> <#/>And there is perfect logic in it <#/>Fictional oral narratives contain and present human
 affairs the daily exploits of human beings <#/>They also present human values <#/>In the traditional set-up women were the custodians of the community's values and beliefs <#/>So they have the duty to pass this on to their children <#/>No wonder the stor
ies that carry such values have to be told to them <#/>What about the men and the boys <#/>Why do they have to be told legends and myths
\par <$C> <#/>I will take that <#/>They have to be told legends because legends talk of wars migration and the general histor
y of the community <#/>The myths contain religious material <#/>It must be remembered that traditionally the men are the custodians of the religious beliefs of the community <#/>It is also their duty to protect the society by participating in and propagat
ing the history of the community <#/>No wonder they have to be told myths and legends which contain that information
\par <$B> <#/>Correct <name/> <#/>Let us move on <#/>We have so far seen that oral narratives are told to the members of the community and are a 
form of entertainment <#/>I should add that in all communities in Kenya the story telling sessions are often looked forward to <#/>Could you tell us what makes the audience enjoy them <name/>
\par <$D> <#/>Partly it is because of the content <#/>As we said earl
ier the themes and subjects treated are very interesting and relevant to our social life <#/>But perhaps what makes them extremely interesting and appealing is the art of story telling employed by the narrator
\par <$B> <#/>What do you mean by that
\par <$D> <#/>The
 narrator acts out the story <#/>He mimics the voices of the various characters as tradition sets <#/>For example if he's telling the story of a trickster he imitates the trickster <#/>Amongst the Luhya he lisps or stammers as he delivers the trickster's 
words <#/>He also delivers them in a shrill high pitched voice
\par <$C> <#/>Besides this imitative speech the narrator will also act out several movements <#/>He waves his hands shakes or nods his head and mimes the various activities done by the characters in a story
\par <$B> <#/>You are right <#/>The various facial expressions bodily movements tonal changes are used in the telling of the story <#/>Indeed the narrator is a dramatist and this often enhances the story and makes it appealing <#/>Let us now look at the
 oral artist <#/>When is a narrator pronounced an excellent narrator by the audience <#/><Name/> tell us
\par <$C> <#/>A good narrator as we have suggested is one who dramatises the narrative effectively <#/>Secondly he is that one who renders the narrative according to the accepted format
\par <$B> <#/>You are correct <#/>Every community has its own way of starting a story <#/>If you tell a story and you fail to use this formula then the community is not pleased <#/>So besides dramatisation a good narrator is one wh
o can tell a story according to the accepted or known conventions in a given community <#/>Do you have anything else to add <name/>
\par <$D> <#/>Yes a good narrator is one who knows the language well <#/>Such a person can tell a story fluently and display a wealth of vocabulary
\par <$B> <#/>You are right <#/>A good narrator was and is one who has a rich language with a number of idioms proverbs and apt vocabulary <#/>You two have told us the role of the oral artist <#/>Can you tell us about the role the audience pl
ays in an oral performance <#/>Yes <name/>
\par <$C> <#/>The audience is as important as the narrator <#/>Often an audience is very active <#/>They are very attentive and are instrumental in making the performance either good or poor <#/>The audience is either 
an active or a passive audience <#/>The narrator looks at the audience as he narrates the story and if they show delight or interest he is encouraged to continue <#/>If they're passive then the narrator is inclined to cut the story short
\par <$B> <#/>Both of y
ou are correct <#/>The audience often decides on one the type of story to be selected two how it is to be told three when it is to end <#/>An audience can even decide on the length of the story telling session <#/>The audience is an integral part of story
 
telling as their response inspires the oral artist <#/>But we must remember that performance is important not only in oral narratives but also in other forms of oral literature such as songs recitations and riddles and proverbs <#/>Now <name/> can you tel
l us about songs when where and by whom they are performed
\par <$C> <#/>Songs are always performed on specific occasions <#/>Such occasions may be ceremonies feasts celebrations initiation birth marriage victory funerals or even at work <#/>Children also sing as they play
\par <$D> <#/>Songs are sung by a special group or an individual or by anybody gathered in the place where the event is taking place <#/>It all depends on the occasion
\par <$B> <#/>The occasion plays a very important role in the performance of a song <#
/>It decides the kind of song to be sung and it even determines the kind of singing to be done <#/>If for example the occasion is a sad one than the songs with a sad mood would prevail <#/>Or still if the singers are well treated by their host they sing m
a
ny songs with happiness and in <-_the> praise of their host <#/>On the contrary if they are disappointed their songs may be full of abuse or insult <#/>The environment enhances the song <#/>Besides the occasion what other items are used to enhance the son
g
\par <$D> <#/>There are also other things like musical instruments the singers' costumes and even their ululations that enhance the singing
\par <$B> <#/>You are right <#/>The song is often sung with accompaniment <#/>
Usually the song is sung with plenty of dancing <#/>In some cases a song may be dramatised <#/>The beauty of a song therefore does not only depend on the words but also on these other aspects of a song <#/>They play a great part in either making the song 
beautiful or more meaningful <#/><Name/> would you like to tell us something on who performs songs
\par <$C> <#/>Songs can be performed by either a group or an individual <#/>Let me add that like narratives a song is often a communal activity <#/>Songs are sung 
by anybody but there are people that are recognised as good singers <#/>Such people are showered with gifts during the singing although these gifts are never looked at as payment
\par <$B> <#/>Thank you <#/>When is a singer considered a good singer
\par <$D> <#/>Thi
s recognition is often accorded to soloists <#/>A soloist is considered a good singer if his voice is clear and if he sings with confidence <#/>When a singer does this his song becomes interesting and even moves the audience into some activity like dancin
g or ululating
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {
<$B> <#/>Such singers sing the songs so <-/emotively> that the audience is compelled to feel what the soloist says or sings <#/>Let us look at the audience <#/>What is their role in the performance of a song
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \fs20 {\fs24\lang2057 <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 <$C> <#/>Let us first of all clari
fy a point or two We can make three distinctions in the performance of song When a song is performed by an individual that is called solo singing Sometimes a song is performed by a group in unison This is called chorus singing And yet sometimes there is a
n
 alternation between the soloist and the chorus in the performance of a song In this case we say the performance is antiphonal Where there is an audience the singers can be affected by this audience One can find a singing troop singing to please the audie
nce As such the audience controls the singing in that the singers choose their songs as dictated by the likes of the audience and they sing them accordingly Like in a story telling session the audience has an impact on how the song is delivered
\par <$B> <#/>Thank you Now let us look at the performance of riddles and proverbs Who performs them <name/>
\par <$D> <#/>Proverbs are delivered when called for If an individual wants to illustrate a point forcibly or wants to explain or teach through a proverb he will quote the relevant proverb in his speech Proverbs are therefore contextual
\par <$C> <#/>As for the riddles these are posed at specific moments when riddle posing is in session Riddles are often posed by children while proverbs are delivered by mature people
\par <$B> <#/>You have told us how proverbs are presented How are the riddles performed
\par <$D> <#/>In riddling there are often two people a challenger and a respondent The challenger poses the riddle the respondent unravels it
\par <$B> <#/>Before the riddle is posed there is 
always a formula to introduce it In Kiswahili it runs <ea/> here comes a riddle and the answer is <ea/> let it come This formula sets the respondent ready for the riddle and when it comes he can think better and so be able to attempt a solution
\par <$D> <#/>Sometimes when a riddler gives a riddle the respondent is not able to give an answer As such the riddle does not end there
\par <$B> <#/>The riddle is a puzzle and when the respondent fails to work out the puzzle he's helped out by the challenger That is why a ri
ddle format may be extended a little longer You mentioned earlier that riddles are delivered by children Why should that be so
\par <$C> <#/>Riddles are a preoccupation of the children because of their nature Often riddles are brief and are fixed Because of this they do not change So they do not need further learning
\par <$B> <#/>Secondly they make references to the environment and because of their fixed nature it is easier to grasp the content they teach So riddles get memorised and the content becomes well known A
s for grown-ups most answers to the riddles are known So they're no longer puzzles Adults therefore do not practise riddling because in their youth they learnt them and there is nothing new to gain by participating in them Would you also say that riddles 
are dramatised just as songs and narratives are
\par <$D> <#/>Although riddles are not as highly dramatised as songs or narratives they nevertheless are not just said
\par <$B> <#/>You are right The participants may choose to deliver them dramatically They may mimic 
or use gestures or use dramatic facial expressions as they deliver the riddles Riddles are therefore performed And that's all for today In this programme we looked at the role of performance in oral literature We looked at the performance of oral narrativ
e
s songs proverbs and riddles We noted that one different types of oral literature are performed by different performers two most performances are undertaken at specific times and on specific occasions three audiences play an important and vital role in de
termining the quality and mode of performance and four dramatisations through such devices as voice variation gestures body movement facial expression and mimicry play a significant role in performance
\par <$A> <#/>And with that we come to the end of our progra
mme today Next week we shall discuss the ogre character in oral narratives This programme was presented to you by Austin <name/> Okumba Miruka and Sabena Okech The programme was written by Angela <name/> It was recorded by <name/> Kiromo and produced by <

\par <$A
> <#/>Today we are beginning a series of eight discussions about the work of school guidance counsellors <#/>This series has been prepared by the guidance and counselling section of the Ministry of Education Science and Technology for teacher counsellors 
a
nd the general public in the hope that they will understand the sincere interest of the ministry in providing services which will help students make the best possible use of their education opportunities and which will help them find a job that will prove
 both self-fulfilling and of value to Kenya and the world of which we are part
\par <$B> <#/>Our students are making good use of the educational opportunities in so far as they understand what education is all about <#/>Most of them are taking the education that
 will lead to exam success and opportunities for higher education or employment seriously <#/>But education in our rapidly changing world means far more than passing examinations and finding employment
\par <$A> <#/>You are right <#/>In the first place educatio
n means gaining an understanding of the forces at work in a developing society of our dependence on each other of our relationships with other nations of our use of natural resources and so on <#/>For example as we learn the great value of our forested ar
eas in bringing the rainfall that is so essential to the production of food can we justify the continued use of charcoal for fuel
\par <$B> <#/>Surely it is understanding of things such as these rather than the mere accumulation of facts that brings about desire
d changes in a society <#/>Thus education means developing new appreciations <#/>Do we appreciate people and the work they do <#/>From the artist who so sensitively captures in a wood carving the wonder of a child he has observed to the aged mother who st
i
ll tends her <ea/>shamba or her children exploring new patterns of city living <#/>Do we truly value a heritage that has made us dependent on close family ties and traditions for support as we move in a changing society <#/>Are we appreciative of the fact
 
that other cultures around us who are also needing support may find it in other values than our own <#/>Yes it is appreciations of the natural world around us of people of their work of our heritage of the rich and varied cultures that surround us such ap
preciation gives depth and meaning to education
\par <$A> <#/>Education also means changing our attitudes too about work for we must understand that all labour which helps people to live happier and healthier lives is important and no contribution toward that en
d may be regarded as insignificant or unworthy <#/>Do we regard the person who does a conscientious job of keeping our streets and public places clean less important in maintaining a healthy neighbourhood than a doctor or nurse <#/>Perhaps we need to chan
g
e our attitude about people not all of whom are alike but all of whom experience the same emotional desires frustrations and joys <#/>And what about our attitude toward change itself <#/>Can we adapt to a rapidly changing world <#/>Do we hang on to old tr
aditions just because they're old or do we reach out for new patterns just because they're new
\par <$B> <#/>Yes these are the concepts which must make up what we call education <#/>Understanding appreciations and positive attitudes are vital to any constructive
 use of knowledge <#/>We must never allow our concept of education to be limited to acquiring knowledge <#/>Having understood what education means then we can readily see areas in which students need help in sorting out the vast stores of information in f
inding stability in rapidly changing world and in focusing on their places in the stream of life
\par <$A> <#/>Too often students do not know how their educational experiences relate to the work they will be doing later in life <#/>They really do not know themse
lves very well what they want to do or what they're capable of doing <#/>Often they are confronted with learning problems or social or personal problems which may retard or impair their developmental learning and progress <#/>These needs of students have 
n
ot been adequately met in our schools <#/>There have been a few lucky students who have received guidance from their teachers <#/>This was possible especially in missionary and boarding schools <#/>But earlier the proportion of teachers to students was mo
re favourable than it is now <#/>Today our teachers have very heavy teaching loads and hardly any time to deal with students' needs
\par <$B> <#/>And yet this help this guidance must be provided by our schools <#/>The school is the largest child and youth servic
e agency <#/>It is the school that has been entrusted with the responsibility for the intellectual and social development of our children and young people <#/>Moreover there are so many things to know and so many changes in the way we live and work that i
t
 takes many people working together to provide the information and help which these students need before they can make wise decisions about their future <#/>And it is during this period in a young person's life when he is most interested in learning about
 the adult world toward which he is moving <#/>Surely the school has or can obtain more resources than any other institution to facilitate that learning
\par <$A> <#/>This is what the Ministry of Education believes <#/>Several years ago they made some very wise 
observations <#/>They realised that in a modern and rapidly expanding educational system it is natural that primary attention is focused on developing new curricula and new teaching methods on organising new programmes and financing new projects <#/>But w
h
ile all these expansion and development is taking place to provide opportunities for the young people to prepare for and to assume responsible positions in society and to more fully understand and appreciate the world in which we live we may well be defea
ting ourselves by losing sight of the student in the system
\par <$B> <#/>You're so right <#/>We are producing syllabi which are relevant to the further educational needs and the employmental requirements of our students <#/>We are developing teaching formats wh
ich motivate the average student to give his best effort to learning <#/>We're providing modern laboratories and libraries to support the efforts of both students and teachers <#/>These are all worthy achievements and should be encouraged <#/>But what if 
the student is unable to take advantage of all these assets
\par <$A> <#/>That is the point <#/>Consider the student who has personal problems that dominate his attention <#/>For example consider the boy whose concern is for a <O/> and overworked mother who has 
put in several hours of work at home before coming to school and whose only interest during school hours is the responsibilities awaiting him when he returns home <#/>Is he in a position to take advantage of relevant syllabi or modern laboratories or thin
k of the student who has come to think of himself as a failure in whatever he undertakes <#/>Is he in a position to make the best use of the educational resources around him
\par <$B> <#/>Certainly uh first of all we must consider the student learning to handle 
personal problems to understand one's capacities and limitations to arrange priorities to make decisions <#/>These are all important attributes for the student who is to make the best use of his educational opportunities <#/>Besides he needs to know the r
elationship of his current studies to the employment he may later seek and he surely needs to know the variety of work opportunities that may be open to him
\par <$A> <#/>These are all vitally important considerations for secondary school students <#/>And somebo
dy has got to see that they have a chance to explore them <#/>This is where the idea of a guidance and counselling programme comes into the picture <#/>You see guidance as a continuing process one that is concerned with the developmental needs of all stud
e
nts <#/>To be effective it must be a systematically planned programme focused on helping young people to understand themselves and their relationship to the world in which they live and to that adult world toward which they are rapidly moving <#/>Do you t
hink people especially the students recognise the importance of guidance and counselling
\par <$B> <#/>No I'm afraid a lot of folks have never heard of guidance and counselling much less recognised its importance <#/>But the Ministry of Education has recognised 
it and so they have established the guidance and counselling unit <#/>This unit has been charged with the responsibility of keeping the student and his needs in the central position in the educational system in Kenya <#/>We will hear a great deal more abo
u
t the guidance and counselling unit and how it is functioning in this series of broadcasts <#/>But uh let's talk for a few minutes about some very special people in our public schools <#/>There are and always have been some teachers who truly believe that
 their students are the most important part of the school <#/>It is gratifying that they are able to give as much time as some of them do to helping students
\par <$A> <#/>You are right <#/>In most schools teachers are teaching twenty-eight to thirty-two out of 
forty periods per week with thirty-eight to forty students in every class <#/>In addition to their teaching responsibilities many of them are carrying additional loads as subject heads class heads or housemasters and there are also extra-curricular respon
s
ibilities in the form of sports dramatics and club activities <#/>Along with these demanding and important uses of their time some teachers truly concerned about the students' ability to take full advantage of the school programme are willing to assume co
unselling duties and are doing their best to make time in their crowded schedules to do this <#/>Often the busiest teachers are the ones who find some free time to help students
\par <$B> <#/>These teachers would like to meet for a weekly period with form one st
udents to help them adapt to the new school and to become aware of the relationship of the work they do there to their future studies and job opportunities <#/>But there is probably no free period in the timetable for such a meeting <#/>The want meet with
 
form two students either as a group or individually to be sure they have made the psychological and sociological adjustments that will help them derive the greatest benefit from their schooling and be sure they understand the importance of making wise cur
riculum choices in form three
\par <$A> <#/>And in forms three and four they want to help them develop an awareness of the world of work that lies ahead by bringing in visitors who can describe a variety of occupations by listening to career tapes prepared by th
e education media service by making visits to businesses and industries by making available to them written materials describing job and training opportunities and by advising them about opportunities for higher education leading to professional careers <
#/>How can students make intelligent choices if they're denied this kind of assistance
\par <$B> <#/>But how can this kind of assistance be made available to them if concerned teachers are not granted time and space for such a programme <#/>Unfortunately in many
 of our schools the only assistance students receive is at the time they complete their career's forms in form four <#/>And that is a process that needs to be based on a broad understanding of one's interests and capacities and a realistic assessment of o
pportunities but which is too often attempted without this understanding <#/>What is the answer <#/>Is it possible that a teacher be assigned to every school whose only responsibility is guidance and counselling
\par <$A> <#/>No that might be the ideal answer bu
t it is not a practical one at this time <#/>In the first place we still do not have enough teachers for our secondary schools <#/>In the second place Kenya has very few teachers who are prepared to be full-time guidance counsellors <#/>But we have made a
 good start in the right direction <X_>}{\v\fs24 
For several years many of our secondary schools have assigned to one of the teachers the responsibility of serving as career advisor His duties have consisted primarily of making available to students information regarding
 career possibilities advising them about curriculum choices and assisting them in completing their careers' forms during the last term of form four Not all advisors have been able to arrange their time schedules to carry out their assigned functions Unfo
r
tunately not all of them are people who are sensitive to and truly concerned about the student and his needs But those who are assuming their added responsibilities with interest and concern are pointing the way to the time when the student will be recogn
ised as the centre of the educational system}{\fs24 
\par }{\v\fs24 <$B> <#/>The title career advisor is gradually being replaced by the term teacher counsellor An advisor becomes aware that if he is doing a good job of helping students plan for their future careers he must be co
ncerned with whatever problems affect their development and success now as well as later The term counsellor or guidance counsellor suggest his interest is of a broad scope not limited to choosing a career The term teacher counsellor best describes the pe
rson who carries these responsibilities in Kenya schools today He is the teacher who understands and willingly assumes the additional counselling function

\par }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>music}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$A> <#/>Programme two The essentials for good guidance and counselling
\par <$B> <#/>Last week we talked of the meaning of guidance and counselling and of the student's need for this kind of assistance }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
We recognised that the student must be at the centre of our thinking as we plan and operate our educational system }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 For the whole system can be justified only if it is serving the needs of students
\par <$A> <#/>Today we shall consider the essential elements for the establishment of a good guidance and counselling programme in a given school }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 I guess I would list in order of imp
ortance first a concerned and competent headmaster or headmistress second a concerned and competent teacher counsellor third supportive staff relationships and fourth adequate facilities in time and space
\par <$B> <#/>Surely uh the headmaster should be at the top of the list for that person carries the ultimate responsibility for the programme and is directly responsible for finding the right person to assume the counselling concerns }{\fs24 <#/>}{
\fs24\lang2057 Without a headmaster who is committed to placing the student and his needs above all other school considerations it is pretty hard for a teacher to set up a meaningful programme
\par <$A> <#/>Such commitment means facing up to the kinds of situations that will arise once the guidance and counselling programme is started }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 For examp
le will the headmaster agree to support his teacher counsellor in finding three or four periods in the timetable so that more responsible consideration will be given to the completion of the careers' forms than was possible last year or another example in
 
the face of the criticism of the mathematics teacher who disapproves of the teacher counsellor keeping some out of class will the headmaster agree that one or more individual counselling sessions with this frustrated student are important in his adjustmen
t to the new school
\par <$B> <#/>Yes commitment is more than a fine sounding word }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 It is courage to stand for what you believe is most important even when it means changes that some of your colleagues won't understand }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
It is patience in interpreting the values on which your decisions are based
\par <$A> <#/>It is true that the headmaster's influence governs all aspects of the school }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 He may delegate many responsibilities to other members of the staff but he must remain in close touch with their activities an
d if a guidance and counselling programme is to be successful it must have the head's unqualified support
\par <$B> <#/>As the chief administrative officer of the school it is his business to know his staff well enough to be able to pick the right people for special appointments }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
Surely he should have the judgement needed to choose a counsellor and to help him or her establish the required relationships with the rest of the staff
\par <$A> <#/>One other reason why a concerned and competent head is so essential to the programme is because he carries final responsibility for determining the counsellor's teaching and extra-curricular loads }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
For setting up the school timetable and allocating classroom space time and space are among the essential elements and the school head controls at them
\par <$B> <#/>Sometimes a headmaster assumes the role of counsellor himself }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Do you think that is a good idea
\par <$A> <#/>No not if someone else that is a concerned and competent person is available because no matter how concerned and competent the head may be we must remember his first responsibility must be to the administration of the whole school programme }{
\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
He simply cannot give the students the personal attention that they should have but he can so administer the total programme that they do occupy that central place in it and he can give full support to the member of the staff chosen to work as the counse
llor
\par <$B> <#/>The teacher counsellor is the second essential element we've mentioned in our list of requirements for a good guidance and counselling programme }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
Let us consider the kind of a person the head looks for for this special responsibility and it is a special responsibility }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
And the appointment of the teacher counsellor is one of the most important decisions a school head makes }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The foremost qualification of such a person is of course his sincere interest in each student's development as a 
person and his commitment to a programme that will provide the conditions for that development
\par <$A> <#/>Right }{\fs24 <#/>N}{\fs24\lang2057 o teacher should be asked to assume the role of counsellor unless he is so dedicated }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 He or she needs to be a warm outgoing person who can
 inspire the confidence of students and the support of fellow staff members because he will undoubtedly be consulting at times with parents and others in the community }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
He will serve as a public relations <-_persons><+_person> interpreting the true meaning of education and the school's concern for the well-being of each student
\par }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>music}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$B> <#/>And he will need initiative for in most situations the guidance programme has not been developed to serve in all the areas that it should }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 He will need organ
isational ability to establish priorities for there will be many and varied demands on his time and of course he will need to be a person of mature judgement
\par <$A> <#/>It sounds as if the teacher counsellor must be some kind of superperson and of course that is exactly what he or she is }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Fortunately such people do exist }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
They have been teaching in our schools since the very beginning and they are there now }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 They wait to be identified to be recognised for the service they're giving and to be encourag
ed to develop the full scope of guidance and counselling services in our schools
\par <$B> <#/>We should talk a bit about supportive staff relationships }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 One may ask the question If a school has a headmaster or headmistress and a teacher counsellor both of w
hom are dedicated to a viable guidance and counselling programme do the rest of the school staff need to participate in it }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Of course they do }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
Every staff member who comes in contact with the student asserts a positive or negative influence on his life }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
Whether they recognise it or not they are helping or hindering that student's development toward responsible maturity }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Of course it is the purpose of the school that these contacts should be positive
\par <$A> <#/>Yes at the same time these staff members are in positions to make many observations which are denied to the head and the teacher counsellor }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
The class teacher meets his students briefly every day and observes their changing attitudes }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The house master gets to know them in their informal hours }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
The sports master sees them under stress and understands their frustrations and joys }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The subject teacher is aware of their determination to succeed or conversely of their disinterest }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
All these people are needed to support the guidance and counselling programme
\par <$B> <#/>Actually the headmaster and the teacher counsellor are the co-ordinators of the programme }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
Surely they will have personal contact with all students as far as time will allow but they must depend on the support and assistance of all other staff members in helping them know the students and understand their needs
\par <$A> <#/>True the guidance and counselling effort to be successful must be a team effort and this fact adds emphasis to the importance of choosing as the teacher c
ounsellor a person who can inspire the rest of the staff to take an active interest in the programme
\par <$B> <#/>And what about the essential element in a good guidance and counselling programme adequate facilities in time and space }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Generally finding spac
e for the programme does not present the challenge but finding time for it does }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 But uh it must be thought about }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
One essential requirement is for a place where a counsellor and student can talk together without distraction }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 This might be in the c
ounsellor's classroom during periods when it is not in use or in a small office at a time when it is not occupied }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 It might be in a corner of the school library or in the chapel at hours when they're not in use }{\fs24 <#/>}{
\fs24\lang2057 It might be in an area of the school grounds where there is little traffic }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
The actual place is not important as is the sense of security that the student must have in knowing that he is speaking with an advisor who respects his confidence }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 In many instances this means that he will want 
assurance that he's not being observed or overheard by other students or staff members }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 It is most helpful if such meeting place is available at specified hours
\par }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>music}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$A> <#/>A counsellor needs a space to keep reference materials professionally ori
ented materials that will help him grow in his understanding of his new responsibilities educational and vocational reference materials for his own use but especially for the use of students as they learn to search out information they need and books and 
pamphlets which challenge the imagination of students as they think ahead to new roles they will play in society }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Again where this space is is not as important as that there is space }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
It may be on certain marked shelves in the library }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 it may be in a cupboard or on a shelf in the counsellor's classroom }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
Hopefully it will be where a student will have easy access to it and where a reading table and chair will permit him to study it and take notes from it
\par <$B> <#/>Sometimes a greater amount of space is needed }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
For example a speaker comes to talk to form four students about employment in a particular industry or a group of students want to listen to several career tapes from the educational media service or form one students as a group need some he
lp in learning how to adjust to new school situations }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Usually these kinds of group meetings will be scheduled far enough in advance so that a vacant classroom or an empty assembly hall may be utilised
\par <$A> <#/>Very few schools have surplus space to be allocated solely the purposes of the guidance and counselling programme }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
But for the teacher counsellor who is well organised and plans ahead and who has a supporting headmaster the problem of space is not one that seriously hinders the programme }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 But what about the problem of time
\par <$B> <#/>That is the real problem }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 As the shape of the desired programme evolves the head master and the teacher counsellor will need to face the hard facts of allocating time for it within the teacher counsellor's twent
y-four-hour day and within the school timetable }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Every school is hard-pressed to set up a realistic timetable which will allow for a well-balanced education with a minimum number of teachers }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
Making room for a sound counselling programme within this framework will be a true test of the school's commitment to it
\par <$A> <#/>If a teacher is to take on the additional counselling responsibility he or she must have an adjustment in his class and extra-curricular loads to make room for it }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 He needs time to 
decide what phases of the guidance programme are to have priority }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 He needs time to organise his pattern of work }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
He needs time for discussing with the headmaster and for establishing staff relationships
\par <$B> <#/>And that is all in preparation for the actual programme itself }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Meeting with the students in groups and individually is the heart of the guidance and counselling programme }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
And time for it must be recognised in the school timetable }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 This is a very critical point }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The point at which many proposed guidance and counselling programmes fail and eventually die }{\fs24 <#/>}{
\fs24\lang2057 The Ministry of Education the chief inspector of schools the headmaster and the staff may all believe in the guidance and counselli
ng programme but they must believe it is fully as important as the required classes in English science or agriculture }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 They must plan time for it in the school timetable just as they do for the required subjects }{\fs24 <#/>}{
\fs24\lang2057 I repeat }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 The failure of the school system to plan time for guidance and counselling means the failure of this vital programme

\par <$A> <#/>This is the first of the eight programmes on an introduction to East African
 Poetry by Jonathon Karere and <?/>Alan Kitonga <#/>In our first two programmes we shall try to give you a general reference to the terminology used in poetic analysis by giving you a simple guide to prosody <#/>Prosody is the study of the technical and f
o
rmal aspects of poetry such as metre rhyme rhythm verse and so on <#/>This prosody section will give you a sufficient understanding of the nature and variety of poetry <#/>It will also give you some reasonable means for reading poetry with appreciative un
d
erstanding and a few primary ideas of how to evaluate poetry <#/>We shall also try to introduce to you some elements of poetry putting the emphasis always on how and why <#/>For example how does a general understanding of these elements help the reader to
 
appreciate fully the meaning of a particular poem to interpret it correctly and respond to it adequately <#/>Why does the poet use these elements <#/>What values have they for the poet and the reader <#/>It is our assumption therefore that our first two p
rogrammes will give the students beginning poetry something they can understand and use in their poetry lessons }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>music}{\fs24  
\par <$B> <#/>Poetry like any language is used all over the world as a means of communication <#/>As a means of communication poetry has no
 limit <#/>It has been used by both the most primitive and the most advanced and civilised peoples of the world <#/>It is therefore not quite right to think that poetry is only read and studied in schools only <#/>Poetry has appealed to the educated the i
n
telligent and the sensitive people as well as to the uneducated and above all to the children <#/>You may ask yourself why is it that poetry appeals to nearly all sorts of people <#/>The answer is simple <#/>Firstly poetry gives pleasure <#/>People have r
ead it or listened to it or recited it because they liked it and it gave them enjoyment 
\par <$C> <#/>Secondly poetry has been regarded as something central to each man's existence something giving unique value to the fully realised life something that one is b
etter off for having and spiritually impoverished without <#/>Having said that much can you attempt a definition of poetry <#/>What is poetry <#/>Poetry can be defined as a way of using language not only to say more but also to say it more intensely than 
i
n the ordinary way <#/>The difference between ordinary language and poetry is very simple to understand <#/>Ordinary language is used to communicate in the practical sense <#/>For example we can say that it is raining outside because we can see it or hear
 
it or even feel it but the language of literature as found in poems plays and novels tries to communicate human experience in a significant and striking way <#/>This is so because it is carefully and deliberately concentrated and organised <#/>Thus the fu
nction of literature is not to tell us about experience but to allow us imaginatively to participate in it by means of broadening or deepening our experience 
\par <$A> <#/>Suppose the word flywhisk was not familiar to you and that you wanted to find its meaning a good dictionary would give you this definition about a flywhisk 
\par <$B> <#/>A device that consists of a bundle of flexible fibres mounted in a handle that is used primarily to brush away flies and that has often served as a symbol of high position or authority 
\par <$A> <#/>Unless you are only interested in this information for your academic purposes you would miss the real meaning of the word flywhisk <#/>It is true that a flywhisk is used to drive away flies and as a symbol of power <#/>But the definition do
es not give us the significant effects and experience of using a flywhisk <#/>Compare and contrast the above definition about a flywhisk with John Ruganda's poem The Flywhisk on page sixty one 
\par <$B> }{\b\v\fs24 <quote_>}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 <#/>The Flywhisk Fling it sharply and growl <#/>Rebels hide their heads <#/>Wave it gently and smile <#/>Flies flit from pus-drooping eyes <#/>Sling it on the arm finally <#/>Empty stomachs will drum for you }{
\b\v\fs24 <quote/>}{\fs24 
\par <$A> <#/>Notice the three different ways of using a flywhisk giving three different way
s of satisfaction fling it wave it and sling it <#/>Giving the effects of command respect and assurance respectively <#/>In this poem John Ruganda not only tells us what a flywhisk is and its uses but also invites us to experience the significance of usin
g the flywhisk in different ways giving us different effects <#/>By the end of the poem we not only know the meaning of the flywhisk but also our experience on its uses and its effects have been broadened 
\par <$C> <#/>Poetry deals with the whole life and not p
art of it <#/>Its primary concern is not with beauty or philosophical truth or with persuasion but with experience <#/>Beauty and philosophical truth are aspects of experience and the poet is often engaged with them <#/>The experience might be beautiful o
r ugly strange or common noble or ignoble actual or imaginary <#/>What might be painful in real life might be enjoyable in poetry <#/>Therefore the reader of poetry must involve not only his intelligence but also his senses emotions and imagination 

\par <$A> <#
/>Poetry unlike ordinary language achieves its extra dimensions in communication by drawing more fully and more consistently on a number of language resources <#/>Some of these resources include the following connotation connotation imagery imagery metaph
or metaphor rhythm rhythm and pattern pattern <#/>By using these resources and the materials of life the poet is capable of shaping and making his poem 
\par <$B> <#/>This brings us to the art of reading a poem to understand and appreciate it <#/>Here are a few 
hints <#/>Number one Read a poem more than once so as to understand its full meaning <#/>Do not expect to understand or appreciate a poem after a first reading <#/>Number two Keep a good dictionary by you and use it to find out the meaning of words and ex
p
ressions you are not familiar with <#/>But this should be done only after you have read the poem right through carefully <#/>Number three It is often helpful to read poetry aloud <#/>Poetry is written to be heard <#/>Its meanings are conveyed through soun
d
 as well as through print <#/>Every word is therefore important <#/>Poems should be read as slowly as possible <#/>Number four Always pay careful attention to what the poem is saying <#/>One should make the utmost effort to follow the thought continuously
 and to grasp the full implications and suggestions <#/>Lastly be alert to the effects a poet may wish to create by use of repetition of the sound 
\par <$B> <#/>To aid us in the understanding of a poem we may ask ourselves a number of questions about it <#/>One
 Who is the speaker <#/>It is wrong to assume that the speaker is the poet himself <#/>You would be safe to assume that the speaker is someone other than the poet himself <#/>Number two What is the occasion <#/>Number three What is the central purpose of 
t
he poem <#/>The purpose of the poem may be to tell a story to reveal human character to impart a vivid impression of a scene to express a mood or an emotion or to convey to us vividly some idea or attitude <#/>Whatever the purpose is we must determine it 
for ourselves and define it mentally as precisely as possible <#/>And lastly once we have known the central purpose of the poem we next consider the question by what means is the purpose achieved 
\par <$C> <#/>Let us try to apply the above four questions to <?/>Kariara's poem Grass Will Grow on page ninety six 
\par <$B> <#/>Grass will grow }{\b\v\fs24 <quote_>}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 <#/>If you should take my child Lord give my hands strength to dig his grave cover him with earth <#/>Lord send a little rain for grass will grow <#/>If my house should b
urn down so that the ashes sting the nostrils making the eyes weep then lord send a little rain for grass will grow <#/>But Lord do not send me madness <#/>I ask for tears <#/>Do not send me moon-hard madness to lodge snug in my scull <#/>I would you send
 me hordes of horses galloping crushing but do not break the yolk of the moon on me }{\b\v\fs24 <quote/>}{\fs24 
\par <$C> <#/>In this poem the speaker is a father who is also head of his household <#/>The occasion is his moment of prayer to his god <#/>During this occasion he cons
iders the possibility of a number of things happening to him like death of his child his house burning down <#/>Consequently he demands to be given strength to bury his child that the rain may fall to enable a new growth of grass <#/>We know that the spea
ker is talking to God because of his calm and resigned tone 
\par <$A> <#/>The central purpose of the poem is quite clear <#/>The speaker prefers loss and suffering to madness which portrays the speaker's emotions 
\par <$B> }{\b\v\fs24 <quote_>}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 <#/>But Lord do not send me madness <#/>I ask for tears <#/>Do not send me moon-hard madness }{\b\v\fs24 <quote/>}{\fs24 
\par <$A> <#/>The speaker would rather have his child dying or his house burning down because he would sooner or later forget and start afresh for grass will grow than getting madness that would lodge snug in his scull 
\par <$C> <#/>The final question by what means is a purpose of the poem achieved is partially answered by describing the poem's framework <#/>The rest requires an accounting of various resources of communication as seen in <?/>Kariar
a's poem Grass Will Grow <#/>The purpose of the poem is achieved by dramatic possibilities of the speaker's losses at the beginning of the first and the second stanzas <#/>In the final stanza the speaker uses natural images moon-hard madness and the yolk 
of the moon which represents the insanity he doesn't want <#/>Suffering is represented by natural images such as hordes of horses galloping or even crushing 
\par <$A> <#/>Finally we shall give you a list of questions that you may apply to any poem in the course of your study in poetry <#/>We have listed down }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24 
 twelve and I'll start from the first <#/>Number one Who is the speaker <#/>What kind of person is he <#/>Number two To whom is he speaking <#/>What kind of person is he <#/>Number three What is th
e occasion <#/>Number four What is the setting in time and place time and place <#/>Number five What is the central purpose of the poem <#/>Number six What is the tone of the poem tone of the poem and how is it achieved <#/>Number seven Discuss the imager
y
 of the poem <#/>What kind of imagery is used <#/>Number eight Point out examples of a metaphor simile personification and explain their appropriateness metaphor simile personification and explain their appropriateness <#/>Number nine Point out and explai
n
 any symbols symbols <#/>Number ten Point out and explain examples of paradox overstatement understatement and irony <#/>What is their function <#/>Eleven Point out significant examples of sound repetition and explain their function <#/>Lastly with these 
points considered you may be in a position to appreciate and evaluate a poem but above all be able to really enjoy it }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>music}{\fs24

ted }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 In our programme today we are going to examine ideas that have developed over many years on child-centred education
\par <$B> <#/>On this programme we shall learn one what child-centred education is two the role of the teacher in child-centred learning and three the kind of activities you can organise in your class to make it child-centred 
\par <$A> <#/>Child-centred education may be best defined as a realistic response to what we know about children their development interests and characteristics 
\par <$B> <#/>
Child-centred education developed from the ideas put forward by educational philosophers and psychologists who realised that children develop at different rates physically mentally emotionally and socially for example the physical skill and co-ordination 
necessary to write legibly is attained by some children at the age of four but not by others until the age of eight
\par <$A> <#/>You already know that children are not simply little adults and that they progress through various stages of development as they grow up }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
You also know that the characteristics they display change during the process of growing up so do their interests and the forces that motivate them }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
Child-centred education therefore attempts to satisfy these needs and assists children who are undergoing these changes 
\par <$B> <#/>Furthermore child-centred education or learning tries to acknowledge that children's needs should determine what is learnt at school }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 This does not mean however that children control what goes on in the school }{\fs24 <#/>}{
\f0\fs24 It means that you and the children in your class are like partners }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 You the teacher play the role of the class leader }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
You've come to appreciate that every child is an individual developing at his own rate and differing in needs abilities interests cultural influence and behaviour }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
These differences must therefore be taken into account when deciding on teaching methods activities and evaluative techniques
\par <$A> <#/>Child-centred education or child-centred learning tries to recognise and respond to the changing characteristics that distinguish children of different ages }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
This is a reason why we organise activity lessons in the lower primary classes and discovery lessons in the upper primary classes }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 Again teachers think of the different exercise
s that are done in physical education lessons in standard two }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 Are they the same for a standard seven child }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
No they are not and once again the reason is that as children grow and develop their interests and abilities change
\par <$B> <#/>Child-centred education also tries to select what is taught and the methods used so that they are appropriate to the understanding and experiences of the children }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
The entire idea of curriculum development accounts for these }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 For example in mathematics you cannot teach children how to multiply before you have told them how to add }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
Likewise you cannot teach them how to read before they have acquired a working or <?/>sight vocabulary 
\par <$A> <#/>In addition to teaching children what is appropriate to the understanding and experience child-centred education or learning trains children in skills that are within the capabilities of their stage of development }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
For example the basic skills of reading and writing are learnt in contexts which are meaningful to the children
 instead of learning the rules of number by memorisation like the multiplication tables they do so by perhaps having a market in the classroom were prices for goods are displayed quantities are weighed costs are calculated money is paid and change is give
n }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 This is learning by doing 
\par <$B> <#/>In these ways teachers children have plenty of opportunities for creative work and self-expression }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 Moreover each child is actively involved in his own learning }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
Child-centred education fosters a sense of responsibility in each child by enabling the child to learn how to act as a leader and make decisions
\par }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>music
\par }{\f0\fs24 <$A> <#/>Teachers I now want to describe a classroom where child-centred learning or education is taking place }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 First of all the classroom should
 be a relaxed and happy place where there is plenty <./>oc opportunity for learning }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
There are should be many interesting learning areas in the classroom for example projects displays science or nature areas discovery tables book corners or library areas activity areas such as the market or shop and creativity corners
\par <$B> <#/>As you have just heard the classroom is a place where children eagerly look forward to coming to one }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 You need to take the role of leader in the class by providing all of these 
different learning opportunities and two you need to have a large pool of local resources and materials readily available at all times }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
This means that once you have a nature table in your classroom you should maintain it regularly by changing the items on it frequently to reflect what you are teaching 
\par <$A> <#/>In the child-centred classroom you will also notice that there are a lot of playthings for children and that they have a good deal of choice over what they do at any particular time though this does not mean children do as they please }{\fs24 
<#/>}{\f0\fs24 They are free however to move around the classroom if they need too }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 You may find some children are working quietly on their own <-/alternativity> while others are working together in a group on something different }{
\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 No one is bored }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 Everyone is involved in his own learning 
\par <$B> <#/>Some are telling other groups of children about something they have just discovered or explaining a difficult problem in an assignment }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 Some may be writing about things the
y have seen while others are painting pictures or making models }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 Yet others may be taking care of the class or cleaning and changing the nature corner 
\par <$A> <#/>From the description of a child-centred learning classroom you can see teachers that learning is taking place all the time some of it directly from the teacher or through the activities and some of it indirectly from the classrooms surroundings }
{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 Children do not have to wait for you to attend to them nor do they have to sit still if they finish their work before their friends for there are so many other things for them to do 
\par }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>music
\par }{\f0\fs24 <$B> <#/>Let us now think about how you organise a child-centred learning situation and what your role in such a learning situation is }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 First of all teachers y
ou need to be flexible and accept the fact that children learn best and are happy when they are actively involved in their own learning }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
This simple means that you should not expect children to sit at their desks hour after hour being taught }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 You sho
uld expect them to be involved in learning activity in one of the learning areas in the classroom and then move on to another learning activity 
\par <$A> <#/>You will therefore need to arrange your classroom in a way which can accommodate children to move freely without disrupting or disturbing other children 
\par <$B> <#/>In organising a child-centred learning situation or classroom you also need to have a flexible timetable One each child can develop his own interests at his own rate of progress Two you teach ski
ll subjects such as reading number work history science geography and others and three you organise socially stimulating learning experiences such as story telling music drama and physical education 
\par <$A> <#/>One other very important learning experience which you can organise in your class is the activity programme }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 The activity programme is the core of child-centred learning }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
Remember teachers a child learns best by doing and finds interest and enjoyment in activity }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 Therefore a child must be give
n every opportunity to discover explore and find out for himself by touching feeling and handling a variety of objects 
\par <$B> <#/>The activity programme makes use of all the senses }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
The more senses that are used in acquiring learning the deeper the impression that is made on the mind of the learner and the more certain we are that the learning will be retained }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 
Here are some activities you can organise for children at different stages in the primary school }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 Listen carefully to them and decide which ones are appropriate for the children in your class 
\par <$A> <#/>Thinking }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\f0\fs24  listening }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\f0\fs24  touching }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\f0\fs24  watching }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\f0\fs24  discussing }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\f0\fs24  playing }{\b\v\f0\fs24 
<&/>bell}{\f0\fs24  reading }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\f0\fs24  drawing }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\f0\fs24  writing }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\f0\fs24  exploring }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\f0\fs24  experimenting }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\f0\fs24  collecting }
{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\f0\fs24  sorting }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\f0\fs24  and classifying }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\f0\fs24  
\par <$B> <#/>Teachers every one of the activities just mentioned can be used in a child-centred learning situation }{\fs24 <#/>}{\f0\fs24 At the end of this programme you should prepare a list of activities you can use in your classroom 
\par }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>music
\par }{\f0\fs24 <$A> <#/>Let's recall here teachers that activity ensures learning through doing and that a child learns best when he is actively involved in 
his own learning <#/>Furthermore pupil activity does the following one adds interest and enjoyment to a lesson and does away with passivity and boredom two reinforces and revises what is being taught three helps to develop a good pupil teacher relationshi
p four encourages initiative creativity and curiosity and five develops or improves basic skills such as reading writing number work and others
\par <$B> <#/>Teachers there are two very essential points to keep in mind if the activity programme and indeed child-
centred learning is to be successful <#/>These are first class discipline <#/>Child-centred learning does not mean allowing children total freedom <#/>}{\fs24 >}{\f0\fs24 
This would lead to chaos and a breakdown of class discipline<#/>This would result in little or no learni
ng taking place <#/>It is extremely important for you to maintain class control at all times by telling children what is expected of them and how they should behave in the class <#/>This will help the child to become honest to himself polite obedient and 
attentive <#/>It will also help him to be responsible to himself and others as well as teaching him to work on his own or with others 
\par <$A> <#/>The second point you need to keep in mind if child-centred learning is to be successful is the fact that you must
 know every child in your class as an individuum <#/>This means you must know his strengths and weaknesses his likes and dislikes and his abilities and interests <#/>By knowing all this information about each child you can plan and supervise suitable lear
ning experiences for your class 
\par <$B> <#/>Teachers let us summarise the main points of today's programme on child-centred education or child-centred learning Child-centred education is defined as a realistic response to what we know about children their dev
elopment interests and characteristics 
\par <$A> <#/>Secondly teachers we briefly describe a classroom where child-centred learning takes place Such a classroom has a relaxed to friendly atmosphere where there is more pupil activity than teacher activity There
 is also a tremendous variety of activity taking place at any one time 
\par <$B> <#/>Thirdly teachers you heard how you can organise child-centred learning in your classroom This means being flexible both in terms of classroom arrangement and time-tabling This will enable you to develop a strong and varied activity programme 

\par <$A> <#/>Last but not least you heard how a good or successful teacher must know each child in his class as an individual and must be able to be maintain good class discipline if child centred learning is to be successful

 <#/>Our radio lesson today is about child-centred education and some of the most famous educational philosophers who contributed to the ideas of child-centred education <#/>Today we shall discuss ideas of Plato Comenius Roussea
u and Pestalozzi and how these ideas are applicable to our education today 
\par <$B> <#/>Before we introduce you to some of these famous men let us fast recall what you heard in our previous lesson about child-centred education <#/>Child-centred education was 
defined as a realistic response to what we know about children their development interests and characteristics 
\par <$C> <#/>Secondly teachers a classroom where child-centred methods are used was described <#/>You can remember that this meant having many and v
aried activities in the class different learning areas and plenty of locally made materials and resources for children to use 
\par <X_>}{\v\f0\fs24 <$A> <#/>Finally teachers your role in child-centred education was described by pointing out that you serve as the guide and a le
ader of the class You will also need to know the interests and abilities of each learner in your class in order to provide appropriate learning activities }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>music}{\v\f0\fs24 
 Let us begin today's lesson by introducing a very famous early Greek philosopher named Plat
o In his early adult years he became attracted to the study of philosophy He became a student and follower of Socrates but upon the death of Socrates Plato established his own school where he told his famous doctrines and continued with his writing 

\par <$B> <
#/>What then was Plato's significant innovation in education He was the first person to develop a systematic theory of education based upon a comprehensive philosophy Some of his most important ideas are concerned with knowledge According to Plato knowled
g
e can only be what is and what is must be timeless and absolute We have knowledge only of the forms themselves and this said Plato arises somehow from within us We really can't say how we come by our awareness and understanding of deep truth Plato suggest
s that we are born with them Knowing therefore is really becoming aware of or recalling what we already have within us
\par <$C> <#/>Another important idea of Plato concerns his view of learning and teaching with its emphasis on continuing inquiring Essentially 
this is the process of ordered debate discussion and argument by which we can establish the truth On teaching learning process therefore the teacher is there to ask questions to stimulate the learner and to help him recall the knowledge that he has alread
y within him 
\par <$B> <#/>These very early ideas and <?/>parts on education from Plato have remained with us and are useful in teaching today In our classes one of the most commonly used techniques is question and answer We also encourage our learners to debat
e and discuss issues so that they can use their knowledge to the best of their ability 
\par <$C> <#/>He believed individuals contribute to the society in different ways 
\par Hence learners should be prepared to take up different occupations in the society He also believed that children's lessons should take the form of play because the teacher can learn more about their natural abilities that way
\par }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>music
\par }{\v\f0\fs24 <$A> <#/>Now teachers let's discuss the ideas of another famous educational philosopher called Comenius Comeni
us lived in the seventeenth century in Europe All of his life and writings were marked by a striving for unity and brotherhood He sought educational opportunities for people of all classes sexes and levels of intelligence He created a model of the educate
d person as one who seeks knowledge from all sources in order to become like the god in whose image man is made Comenius most widely read and influential book was thought to have been the first children's picture book
\par <$B> <#/>Comenius believed the early years of a child's life are vitally important He further believed that the following moral qualities should be developed in the young child He should be truthful obedient temperate clean generous industrious patient co
urteous and modest
\par <$A> <#/>Comenius further regarded discipline as essential for learning Without discipline one learns nothing or at least nothing correctly He goes further to say that discipline should be efficient in making the learner accomplish a task
 at hand For Comenius discipline was meant to develop human nature and was to be used as a means of enforcing instruction
\par <$B> <#/>Another major contribution Comenius made was his believe that an educated man is one whose senses are attuned to the learning
 possibilities of the world According to Comenius all learning comes through the senses Therefore if we would create understanding we must educate the senses through studying things and words together 
\par <$C> <#/>In classrooms and schools around our country 
today Comenius' ideas still continue to be practised As you well know teachers we are not solely concerned with what a learner knows but we are as well concerned with his personality One of our main roles in teaching therefore is development of the whole 
child 
\par <$A> <#/>You also appreciate that learning cannot take place in the absence of discipline Even where child-centred education and methods are used discipline in both the teacher and the learner is an essential condition As Comenius said a teacher whos
e learning merits as team should possess such authority and command such respect that a pupil would think it's sinful to offend him In other words teachers you need to be self-disciplined in order to gain respect from your learners }{\b\v\f0\fs24 
<&/>music}{\v\f0\fs24  Another well-k
nown educational philosopher of the eighteenth century was Jean-Jacques Rousseau Rousseau was a Frenchman born in the Swiss city of Geneva He received very little formal education and tried a number of occupations non of each led to success It was only wh
en he began writing and publishing his essays that he received attention One of his most famous books "\'c9mile" aroused the hostility of the Catholic church and he fled his homeland to safety in England 
\par <$B> <#/>The most important educational work Rousseau published was a set of books entitled 
\par "\'c9mile" "\'c9mile" is devided into four books each one dealing with a separate stage in a child's development In the first book Rousseau talks about the importance of the child being brought up by his own mother and not h
anded over to a nurse or <O/> as is common in parts of our own society today
\par <$C> <#/>Rousseau also thought it was important to ensure that the child's opportunities for as many different experiences as possible are not restricted What the young child does
 learn he said is based on sensory and practical experience rather than ideas or reasoning He is not ready for purely mental activity yet Learning experiences that are appropriate now are drawing measuring speaking and singing 
\par <$A> <#/>As the child develo
ped Rousseau believed the basic techniques of learning was the problem solving or discovery method by which the child himself finds answers to the questions that interest him Thus or learning should still come from his own observations and experiences not
 only from that of his teachers or from books 
\par <$B> <#/>In the fourth book which covers the period of adolescence Rousseau felt that the child was now ready for the study of subjects such as history literature art languages social studies and politics Once 
again the methods used to learn these subjects are child-centred and stress the child's active involvement in the learning process 
\par <$C> <#/>Teachers let's stop and thing about Rousseau's significant innovations and ideas in educational thought They include the following }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\v\f0\fs24 
 Appreciating the value of discovery learning and problem solving as educational techniques }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\v\f0\fs24  Confining the child's early learning to things that are within his own experience and therefore have meaning for him }{
\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\v\f0\fs24  Stressing the rights of each child to individual consideration freedom and happiness }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\v\f0\fs24 
 Realising the need to understand the child's nature and the way this develops through childhood and adolescence and using these knowledge to determine what he should learn at each stage of his development }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\v\f0\fs24 
 Treating the child as a human being in his own right not just as a miniature adult and therefore stressing the enrichment of his present experience rather than preparing him for some distant future 
\par <$B> <#/>Each of these ideas is appropriate and practicable in our classrooms today
\par Do you cater for each of them Good }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>pause}{\v\f0\fs24  if you do you are applying child-centred methods in your teaching 
\par }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>music
\par }{\v\f0\fs24 <$A> <#/>The next educational philosopher whose ideas we wil
l hear about is Pestalozzi Pestalozzi was born in Switzerland in the middle of the eighteenth century He was a disciple of Rousseau and took great interest in Rousseau's work Pestalozzi spent a great part of his life trying to bring about social and educa
t
ional reform Through his writings Pestalozzi set out his thoughts and general ideas about education He also opened his own school which became a centre for leaders in primary school education all over the world Many of his ideas were to have a profound ef
fect on modern progressive education 
\par <$B> <#/>Pestalozzi's basic principles of education included a concept of child development which sought an education of love rather than a mechanical instruction This is best explained as a personal relation between te
achers and pupils rather than subject-matter relations 
\par <$C> <#/>Pestalozzi demonstrated that by working out a set of ordered sensory experiences a child could by spontaneous activity develop the powers of his mind He also believed the naturalistic method 
of teaching was one moving from the simple to the complex from the concrete to the abstract from the known to the unknown 
\par <$A> <#/>The most important idea Pestalozzi developed was that of object teaching Listen to his set of introductory rules for lessons in object teaching }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\v\f0\fs24 
 Activity is a law of childhood Accustom the child to do educate the hand }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\v\f0\fs24  Cultivate the faculties in their natural order Develop the ability of thinking step by step }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\v\f0\fs24 
 Begin with the senses and never tell a child what he can discover for himself }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\v\f0\fs24  Reduce every subject to its elements one difficulty at a time is enough for a child }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\v\f0\fs24 
 Proceed step by step <O/> The measure of information is not what the teacher can give but what the child can receive }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\v\f0\fs24  Let every lesson have a teaching point either immediate or remote }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{
\v\f0\fs24  Develop the idea then give the <?/>time then develop the language }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\v\f0\fs24  Proceed from the known to the unknown from the particular to the general from the concrete to the ab
stract and from the simple to the more complex }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>bell}{\v\f0\fs24  
\par <$B> <#/>Teachers I hope you listened carefully to those steps They are the same ones you should follow when preparing and presenting a lesson to the children in your class 
\par <$C> <#/>Do the ideas of these famous educational philosophers sound familiar Yes }{\b\v\f0\fs24 <&/>pause}{\v\f0\fs24 
 What you need to remember is that these ideas should be applied and used where child-centred education is practised By doing so you will be providing a firm foundation and grounding for the children in your class 
\par <$A> <#/>In our next lesson we shall listen to more great ideas of other famous educational philosophers

s topic we shall first of all revise what we discussed last week <#/>In our last programme we said One Poetry appeals to all sorts of people because it gives them pleasure and enjoyment Two Poetry differs from ordinary language in that unlike or
dinary language that communicates practical experience poetry communicates significant experience which is concentrated and organised <#/>We also suggested some hints to you that can be applied to any poem so as to help you understand and appreciate the p
oem }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>music}{\fs24\lang2057  <#/>This week we shall d
iscuss the elements of poetry <#/>In this programme we shall try to discuss some primary poetic elements that give problems to some students <#/>I feel these elements include the following One What use in literary setting or denotations and connotations o
f words What use in literary setting or denotations and connotations of words Two Imagery Imagery and three Figurative language Figurative language 
\par <$B> <#/>Let us start our discussion by examining word use in poetry <#/>You should realise that a poet does
 not choose his words aimlessly <#/>A good poet chooses his words with great care and you should be alert to notice their full significance <#/>In poetry the average word has three component parts <#/>These are One Sound Sound Two Denotations Denotations 
Three Connotations Connotations <#/>The literal dictionary meaning of a word is its denotation <#/>The connotation of a word is what the word suggests beyond what it expresses its overtones of meaning 
\par <$C> <#/>For example the word home by denotation means 
a place where one lives but by connotation the word home suggests security love comfort and family <#/>Your first problem in reading poetry is to try to develop a sense of language and a feeling for words <#/>This can only be overcome by extensive use of 
t
he dictionary and extensive reading <#/>In <?/>Kariara's poem Grass Will Grow the speaker asks for tears which by connotation means weeping mourning suffering loss sadness grief and so on instead of being given madness which according to him is a more sev
ere punishment as compared to tears 
\par <$A> <#/>Another important tool of uh poetry is imagery <#/>Imagery may be defined as the representation through language of sense experience <#/>Poetry appeals directly to our senses though of course its music and rhyth
m does the same too and this is what actually what we hear when it is read aloud <#/>But indirectly poetry appeals to our senses through imagery which is the representation to the imagination of sense experience <#/>When we speak of an image we normally t
hink of a mental picture which is in our mind\rquote 
s eye <#/>This visual imagery is common in poetry <#/>You must note that an image may also represent a sound a smell a taste a tactile experience for example like hardness wetness or cold <#/>An image may also r
epresent any internal sensation such as hunger thirst or nausea or movement or tension in the muscles or joints 
\par <$C> <#/>Jonathan <?/>Kariara's poem The Boat is about death <#/>The speaker laments the death of a very important and a powerful member of par
liament <#/>Due to the death of this minister the speaker seems to be quite helpless lonely and very bitter <#/>He has lost his sense of direction because he has no leader <#/>He seems to have no strength for anything else except to mourn his departed min
i
ster <#/>He sees the death of the minister as a bringer of shame and wanton destruction <#/>But the poet does not tell us these things directly <#/>In fact he does not use the word death in his poem <#/>His concern is to communicate experience and not inf
o
rmation <#/>He does this by creating images that represent death and sorrow <#/>The siren of the ambulance creates an image of danger and most likely death in our minds <#/>Cold wind represents death and solitude <#/>Listen to the following conversation o

\par <$D> <#/>Oh come in please <#/>You are a pretty sight <#/>Got slightly wet did you 
\par <$E> <#/><-/>Ah wet I\rquote m drowned <#/>It's raining cats and dogs outside and my raincoat\rquote s just like a sieve 
\par <$C> <#/>It is likely that the two friends understand each other pretty well but if you examine their conversation literally that is to say unimaginatively you will find that they have been speaking nonsense <#/>Actually they have been speaking
 figuratively <#/>They have been saying less than what they mean or more than what they mean or the opposite of what they mean or something else other than what they actually mean <#/>By using figures of speech we can say what we want to say more vividly 
and forcefully than saying it directly <#/>A figure of speech can simply be defined as a way of saying one thing and meaning another 
\par <$A> <#/>The commonly used figures of speech include the following metaphor personification symbol overstatement understate
ment and irony <#/>We shall give you a brief definition and examples of each of the figures of speech mentioned earlier <#/>To begin with metaphor and simile <#/>These are comparisons between things which are unlike <#/>The only distinction is that in sim
ile the comparison is expressed that is stated by the use of some word or phrase such as like as than similar to or resembles <#/>For example <?/>Barak Omondi\rquote 
s poem Luo Dancer on page eleven opens with a comparison of the onlooker to an opium addict <#/>It
 goes Like an opium addict you watch her red-eyed <#/>In the last stanza the poet uses another striking simile to show the onlooker's inability to act by comparing him to a castrated bull <#/>The line goes as follows Like a castrated bull you stare at her
 
and her man <#/>In metaphor the comparison is implied that is the figurative term is substituted for or identified with the literal term <#/>For example when Okoth Ogendo in his poem The Dancing Maniac the fifth stanza on page thirteen writes that I will 
l
et loose this caged spirit upon you he is using a metaphor for he identifies his caged spirit which gives animal-like qualities with his great desire for the woman he is inviting for the dance <#/>This brings us to another element of poetry personificatio
n <#/>Personification consists of giving the attributes of human being to an animal an object or an idea <#/>Personification is a kind of metaphor an implied comparison in which the figurative term of the comparison is always a human being 
\par <$C> <#/>For exa
mple when Charles <?/>Owore in his poem The Bond on page one hundred and twenty writes he shook hands with loneliness he is personifying the idea of loneliness by giving human qualities to an abstract idea <#/>These human qualities <-_includes><+_include>
 the shaking of hands <#/>In the same poem the poet is using fire symbolically <#/>He writes 
\par <$A> <#/>The Bond He shook hands with the loneliness who invited him to sit beside a fire and warm his hands <#/>Together they recounted tales of a love left behind exchanged cups of tears and sadly smiled at each other\rquote 
s faces as the flames linked them each to each 
\par <$C> <#/>Probably he sat beside a fire not only to warm his hands but also to comfort himself or to console himself or to help him forget a love left b
ehind <#/>A symbol may be roughly defined as something that means more than what it is <#/>Symbols vary in the degree of identification and definition that the authors give them <#/>Although the poet may pin down the meaning of his symbol to something fai
rly definite and precise more often the symbol is so general in its meaning that it is able to suggest a great variety of more specific meanings <#/>For example a flag represents a nation a Mercedes Benz is a sign or symbol of power or wealth 
\par <$A> <#/>Othe
r commonly used figures of speech include the following One Overstatement And two Understatement and irony <#/>Overstatement means saying more of what one really means <#/>For example if you say I will die if I don't pass my literature paper in the forthc
oming examination you don't expect the people to believe you <#/>You are merely adding emphasis to what you really mean <#/>When Charles <?/>Owore in his poem Your Cigarette Burnt The Savannah Grass on page one hundred and eighteen writes 
\par <$B> <#/>Come lis
ten to a boiling pot touch its heart and tell me what do you hear <#/>The sun sent down showers of heat that burned to cinder your <?/>edding conscience the earth at the touch of your fingers cracked <#/>Colour melts at your stare <#/>Orange white blue <O
/> and all are the same to you <#/>Your cigarette burned the savannah grass the scorpion bit me and I cried <#/>The earth at the touch of your fingers cracked 
\par <$A> <#/>It is obvious that he does not want us to understand him <-_literary><+_literally> because we would not expect the ground to crack open if someone placed their fingers on it 
\par <$C> <#/>On the other hand understatement or saying less than what one means may exist in what one says or merely in how one says it <#/>For example you commonly hear pe
ople inviting others for a bite when the table is actually is laid with different kinds of foods for example <ea/>matoke <ea/>ugali roastmeat and so on <#/>A bite is used when one is stating less than the truth <#/>Also in <?/>Maragoli Wedding Song on pag
e eleven the poet understates the warning to the bride when he writes 
\par <$B> <#/>To the bride <#/>It is difficult really difficult to leave your home for another place <#/>Refrain to the bridegroom but cultivate cultivate well so that the seeds of our ancestors can continue to bear fruit 
\par <$C> <#/>The real problem of the bride is not actually leaving her home for the man's home but when she tries to adjust and acquaint herself to her new home and bring it up <#/>Therefore the poet stated less than what he mea
nt <#/>When David Rubadiri in his poem Stanley Meets <?/>Mutesa on page twenty eight writes 
\par <$A> <#/><ea/><O/> <ea/>karibu White men you are welcome <#/>The gate of polished reeds closes behind them and the West is let in 
\par <$C> <#/>The poet meant more than what he stated <#/>It wasn't merely letting the West in <#/>The action allowed in all the evils associated with the West for example colonisation exploitation brainwashing just to mention a few 
\par <$A> <#/>Lastly but not the least we shall discuss irony in
 poetry <#/>Irony means saying one thing but meaning another <#/>Irony is useful in poetry because it creates humour <#/>A situation can be said to be ironical when the outcome of an event is contrary to what might have been expected <#/>Do not confuse ir
o
ny which means the opposite of what one means with sarcasm and satire <#/>Sarcasm is a bitter or cutting speech which is intended to wound or hurt the feelings of another while satire is ridicule of human folly or vice in a humorous way <#/>A poet uses sa
tire with the purpose of bringing about reform or at least of keeping other people from falling into similar folly or vice 
\par <$C> <#/>A very good example of satire in poetry is found in Henry Barlow's poem Building The Nation on page seventy one <#/>The poet
 wrote this poem to satirise those people in positions of authority who say all the right things but fail to practise what they preach <#/>In public they appear to be very busy but actually doing nothing <#/>Examples of sarcasm can be found in <name/> poe
