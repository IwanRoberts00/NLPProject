\par <$A> <#/>how would you like one to look at the linguistic competence }{\b\v <&/>pause}{ <#/>Putting aside uh the theory by Noam Chomsky and Dell Hymes\rquote  idea of uh communicative competence according to you what's the idea of competence }{\b\v 
<&/>pause}{ Yes
\par <$B> <#/>I think competence the way I understand competence like the way a kid a child can be able to use the language to understand the language and like apply the language to usage as he's been taught earlier
\par <$A> <#/>So in other words it's more of uh the application part of the language 
\par <$B> <#/>Yeah
\par <$A> <#/>So you differ with uh basically you differ with Chomsky's idea that uh linguistic competence is basically that set of rules that is in the child you know uh
 let alone applying it <#/>Right <#/>Now I want to look at this <#/>I want to have uh this discussion in advanced levels <#/>Of course we're dealing with a cognitive level uh if possible at a phonological level that's about the sounds uh orthographic leve
l
 lexical level roughly and so on <#/>Now cognativism basically has to do with the mind as we all know <#/>And cognativists are <-/>are interested in explaining the <-/>the underlying motivation of a language and speech <#/>Okay <#/>And of course talking a
bout cognativism we are reminded of Jean Piaget the famous psychologist <#/>Now Jean Piaget argues that a <-/>a child\rquote 
s language development uh basically depends on three main factors <#/>The first factor he says is interaction with his environment <#/>The 
second factor he says it is his perceptual and cognitive capacity <#/>And the third factor he says it is his linguistic experiences okay <#/>Now interaction with the environment uh <#/>We want to see how this <./>c are applied can be applied to <-/>to <-/
>to <-/>to uh <-/>to what is this called children\rquote 
s literature or the literary text made for the child so that it can help him to <?/>get that competence in the language <#/>Now if you talk about interaction with his environment as Jean Piaget says like tak
e for example this story of uh the elephant and other animals it is <-/>is found in a book The Source Stories <#/>I've forgotten the <-/>the author <#/>The Source Stories <#/>Now in this kind of <-_>in this in this kind of<-/> story we have uh we got so m
a
ny animals okay and then uh the elephant the hare the lion and so on and so forth <#/>And then they say that uh all of a sudden it became very dry <#/>There was drought all over <#/>It was so dry he says he says uh even the palm tree could not produce liq
u
or <#/>I believe this should have been somewhere in the coast <#/>Now what I'm saying is uh this kind of story explains so many things about the environment <#/>It explains uh the purpose of trees the purpose of animals the animals are all named there and
 that there can be drought in an environment <#/>In other words what I\rquote 
m saying is this kind of story exposes the child to the environment so in a way that child is able to interact with the environment through this story <#/>Okay <#/>And since uh as Jean P
iaget says that uh the a child's interaction with the environment is a basic factor in knowing in a child's developing uh linguistic competence <#/>Then I should think uh the literary text indeed helps a child to develop competence in a child unless you w
ant to object }{\b\v <&/>pause}{ <#/>Mary anything to say
\par <$C> <#/>With the interaction with the environment uh a <-/>a child not only have the written texts but you have the spoken texts for example we have the child\rquote s play and the games that usually have within th
e environments and some of these songs and games can have could be that repetitive part and they can even have some words that the child at the end of the day will question what they are and it is in his <O/> trying to know what these words are the child 
will come to improve his competence <#/>So the child's competence or the child's linguistic competence can improve through the written as well as the spoken text <#/>That's my view
\par <$D> <#/>Okay another addition or rather a question <#/>As far as this <-/>this kind of environment is concerned can we <./>s }{\lang1024 <-_}{
>can we<-/> say that uh this environment must be the that <./>ki that particular environments in which the child finds himself of herself or is this just in <-/>in any other environment <#/>For example u
h applying uh I'm referring to a situation whereby maybe an African child okay he's <-/>he's exposed to that kind of environment in which he finds himself <#/>Or at another level we find that this text is extracted for uh for maybe a <-/>a <./>Eu <-/>a Eu
ropean environment <#/>So at that level which kind of environment have you referred to
\par <$A> <#/>Well I would think uh any type of environment whether immediate environment or other environment <#/>Did you think even if you talk if you wanted to talk about i
f a text is talking about things that are not actually present in the immediate environment of the child it\rquote s talking about snow it\rquote 
s talking about uh well maybe some kind of plants that are not present in the immediate environment <#/>But you see the chil
d still is coming to learn about these things you see <#/>He knows that at least they are present <#/>Maybe in future he want to talk about them <#/>So if he's been exposed to these kind of things this kind of vocabulary at the beginning then it will be e
asy for him to express himself <#/>I mean that's basically what we're interested in the competence of the child 
\par <$D> <#/>Then I think that in the same <-_>in the same<-/> on the same token I could just ask maybe it is better as far as this cognitive level 
is concerned <#/>Imagine the <-/>the book talks about a problem okay learning from known to the unknown <#/>Then I think as far as the environment is concerned it is better to impose or to expose the child to his <./>imme okay to <./>s the stories which c
ome from his immediate environment and then as <./>ti as he continues to learn then you can bring stories from a far off environment 
\par <$A> <#/>Yeah I think that is true <#/>Okay now }{\b\v <&/>coughing}{ we also talked about okay <#/>Jean Piaget also talks about his
 <./>percep uh the child's perception and cognitive capacity and his linguistic experiences <#/>Now here this is where your point comes in Mr <name/> uh that uh sometimes uh the child through the text is also exposed to things that don't appear in his <./
>imme immediate <-/>immediate environment <#/>For example if we talk about the famous <-_>the famous<-/> poem in called the London Bridge <#/>It's found on page sixty-eight in this book}{\b\v <&/>citation of poem}{
 <#/>You know this kind of thing <#/>Now the child m
ay not even have seen uh the gold the silver or this kind of <-/>of this kind of things that are mentioned in the text okay <#/>Because maybe they are not in his <./>envi immediate environment <#/>But we can also note the fact that the child in future mig
h
t want to use that kind of vocabulary to express one thing or another okay <#/>For example he might not have seen gold around but at least he might have seen a golden watch okay <#/>So if he wants to say that this watch is made of gold unless he's exposed
 
he the child will have been exposed at the beginning from this kind of thing it will be difficult for him to express himself <#/>Okay so Jean Piaget also says that uh children learn language by associating it with context <#/>Children learn a language ass
o
ciating with context <#/>They also learn a language by associating it with meaning <#/>Now as far as this context is concerned I wanted to <#/>I was thinking for example in the animal story I told you about the context within that story basically is uh th
e
 animal world okay <#/>So within that context we have some kind of things uh that uh are expected in such a context for example the name those names of animals the hare the animal and so on and so forth okay <#/>So the way in which the literary text this 
k
ind of literary text will expose the child to the world improve the competence of the child is that uh when it comes to such a context the child is aware that he's already aware of the kind of vocabulary that is expected the kind of words that are expecte
d in such a situation and therefore he is able to express himself like that <#/>When we come to uh uh <./>s }{\b\v <&/>coughing}{
 since Jean Piaget also says that a child learns a language by associating it with meaning <#/>Now for example in this story of the eleph
ant and other animals we're told okay in the long run the animal decided to dig a well so that uh they can have access to water }{\b\v <&/>coughing}{\v  }{
<#/>Now all the animals participated in that exercise but the hare as clever as he was did not want to participate 
in this kind of exercise <#/>He said he can survive he can <-_>he can<-/> still survive with or without water okay <#/>And therefore when eventually they had dug the well and the water was now flowing the hare wanted to use that water so uh the uh <-/>the
 
animals decided that they would come they would keep vigil in turn they would guard the well in turns so that the hare could not <-_>the hare could not<-/> uh get access to that water <#/>Now what I want to refer it to is <-/>is the term keep vigil okay k
e
ep vigil <#/>So the child may not be even aware of uh the meaning of such a term in the first place okay but he can associate it with the meaning <#/>The meaning in this context is that uh uh the idea was to prevent the hare from getting the water okay <#
/
>So uh even though the <-/>the <-/>the child might not know the meaning of this word he can still understand that the <./>m uh <-/>the main aim is to keep watch for the child I mean for the hare not to get the water to drink this water <#/>Now there is th
is poem which uh this poem called The Little Fish of }{\b\v <&/>pause}{ The Little Fish That Will Not Do As It Was Bid <#/>I\rquote ll just read it briefly <#/>This poem goes like this }{\b\v <&/>citation of poem}{
 <#/>Now this <-/>this poem basically is about a little fish and his
 mother in the sea and it wanted to uh and it wanted to go and okay but it wanted to go and eat uh a fly <#/>But you know it was it is that hook <./>whe when the fishermen go to the sea they use the <-/>the flies sometimes they use the flies to as a <-_>a
s
 a<-/> bait yeah <#/>So actually that fly was a bait and the little mother and the little fish was asking permission from his mother to go and eat that and eat that fly <#/>But its mother told her that that is not just a fly but it is a bait you know <#/>
B
ut this little fish could not did not want did not take heed of this advice and so it went ahead to eat that fly and then it was stuck and it's <-/>and <-/>and so it died <#/>Now what I'm interested in <-/>in this poem is uh <-/>is the way in which uh as 
a
 text it involves uh a beginning and an ending okay kind of a cause and an effect <#/>It involves rather a sequence of events that uh actually culminated into the death of a little fish <#/>And when it when we relate this to the child's experience it's li
k
e a kind of experience it <./>gi gives to the child is that uh the child through such a kind of a text it learns to it learns to put things sequentially it learns to put things in a sequence that uh things that don't I mean just don't come from nowhere an
d you know there has to be a kind of a <-/>a beginning a middle and an end that kind of thing <#/>Okay }{\b\v <&/>pause}{ I will do the phonological level if you don't have any questions }{\b\v <&/>pause}{ 
\par }\pard\plain \s17\fi-283\li283\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang1031 {<$C> <#/>Let me ask something
\par <$A> <#/>Please
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<$C> <#/>We have some 
stories with a complicated plot whereby we don't have a flow of ideas from one step to another one <O/> we find that there is that mix up of events <#/>How do you react to that now that you have said that the ordering of events like that straight forward 
plot within that poem will enable the child to put things <./>sec <./>sec you know
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang1031 {<$A> <#/>sequentially 
\par <$C> <#/>sequentially <#/>Now what would you react to such a story whereby you have so many plots that some are mixed and some are juggled <#/>How would you help the child to read one 
\par <X_>}{\v <$A> <#/>What do you think cause me I think uh basically the child needs to know that things happen in a sequence <#/>Because uh linguistic competence is about communication right }{<#/>}{\v And communication involves uh arranging 
ideas well so that they relate to one another one after the other you know <#/>Just don't jumble them up you know <#/>Yes 
\par <$E> <#/>Okay I just want to add and support your point that uh when we look at okay when we look at this theory of Jean Piaget }{<#/>}{\v T
his uh uh there is one of those six principles which is called cognitive structures <#/>And cognitive structures says states that you know the <-/>the child's mind is ordered in such a way that it is <-_>it is<-/> created in such a way that he is able to 
g
rasp the simple things and then it grows up to the more complex things <#/>And I think in children's literature therefore that's why we have this thing okay these books like the beginners' series okay <#/>And then we have the <-/>the continuing series and
 
then the pace-setters beginning from the simple or the simple text to a more complex text texts okay <#/>And therefore when <-/>when a child is exposed to this beginners' series in the beginner series we realise that okay the most of the stories begin fro
m
 the cause to the effects and therefore it brings this idea of you know <./>s <./>sequen sequence yeah sequential <#/>So even if the child <./>la now or later reads these uh complex stories by the end of the day he shall have known that things need to be 
put in order from the beginning to the end from the cause to the effects 
\par <$A> <#/>Yes Epher <#/>You have something to say
\par <$B> <#/>Basically I wanted to say what he said that it's just that I believe because uh a writer who is writing for kids it would be 
very unfair for him to jumble up all the information of the plot <#/>It would be fair for him to put it sort of like a series or a sequential theme more than a mixed up plot like she said <#/>We agree there are mixed up plots but I don't think they're bas
i
cally for the children's level <#/>They are more advanced as we go on if someone is able to place things from a jigsaw <#/>Anyway it even helps the <./>s the mixed-up plot could even help <#/>The kids have <./>g games like jigsaws <#/>You know it helps yo
u <#/>Everything is jumbled up and you're supposed to make sense out of it <#/>It could help <#/>I\rquote 
m not saying it's totally not there <#/>If it's there it can help in the child's development to see how he can put things together and make a whole out of it <#/>That\rquote s how I feel about it 
\par <$A> <#/>Yes
\par <$F> <#/>I also don't agree to the fact that all children's literature is structured <#/>For example if you take for example a film <#/>There is a film we watched in high school in high school about a clash of t
itans <#/>And these films can be watched by adults as well as children <#/>It has a flashback <#/>So I don't think <#/>It's about Greeks and the gods <#/>So I don't think children's literature is structured in such a way so it could also be <?/>conflicts

\par <$A> <#/>Now let me ask you a question now <#/>How do you think uh the jumbled structure of such a <-/>a movie a story or a <-/>a movie could help build the competence of a child realistically
\par <$C> <#/>Excuse me
\par <$A> <#/>Yeah
\par <$C> <#/>You see like for example if all the texts for a child would have that straightforward plot in other words be a sequential I think at the end of the day we are going to become stereotyped <#/>Because <O_>}{\b\v several words}{\v 
<O/> a book he or she is expecting that kind of a thing <#/>B
ut if a child at one point or another meets such a challenge <#/>I think it would be a point only to be a point of departure the child can start growing and maturing and actually become more diverse in the way he sees things <#/>You see although the unive
r
se is ordered it is still again a chaos <#/>And I <-/>I think it's at the end of the chaos and again we come into unity <#/>So I think the child should not only be given these books or these texts with straightforward plots but should as well be exposed t
o complex plots so that he can be in a position to compare and at the end of the day he might come with something better but not <O_>}{\b\v several words}{\v <O/>
\par <$A> <#/>Yes
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {\v <$?> <#/>Yeah I <-/>I think uh the issues we are raising are very very crucial <#/>Ideally sp
eaking of course uh for children's literature just like uh our colleagues have been saying we need to have a general logical sequence that the child gets that sense of order <#/>But uh I would have liked to also see just as uh some of my colleagues have s
e
en it but there are will be cases all right where you may find a <-/>a jumbled-up or <-/>mixed <-/>mixed mixed-up plot for instance uh a flashback like the good example he was giving <#/>I was just thinking of other films where I've seen the same kind of 
thing <#/>And sometimes the character is even a child <#/>But uh I <-/>I think uh that helps to answer uh what uh uh maybe he\rquote 
s raising <#/>But in the process of also making the child aware of a logical sequence you also have to keep challenging the child a
s the child becomes more aware of a more complex world and therefore you may create this kind of jigsaw kind of plot or sequence so that you enable the child to <-/>to <-/>to begin to try and put things in order connect things because at the end of the da
y
 we are also going to perhaps argue following Jean Piaget's argument that for us <-/>us or even when there is a mix-up of a plot we still are challenged to bring it connect everything together <#/>It <-/>it works even for children's for <-/>for adults' bo
oks uh <#/>Even if you read A Grain of Wheat }{\b\v <&/>novel by Ngugi wa Thiong\rquote o}{\v 
 for instance is not a book that has what one would call a straightforward plot but you're challenged to bring it into an order <#/>So if that is also part of it the <-_>the the<-/> 
brain is also supposed to uh be able to meet challenges and you know build up on it <#/>So uh I think what ideas are important and the crucial idea you're bringing up is at the end of the day the child has to realise a certain order and the <-/>and the<-/

\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<$B> <#/>Now we briefly look at uh Kiswahili in Tanzania and then we will compare uh the 
Swahili in uh Tanzania and Kenya <#/>Now we know the history of Kiswahili and how it began maybe uh as a lingua franca between the Arab traders and the African traders along the coast and then uh it\rquote 
s diffused in the interior <#/>I think that one we are aware of it <#/>So Kiswahili use has started uh becoming uh elitist in colonial Tanganyika that\rquote 
s what I said in my paper <#/>The German administrators encouraged the African chiefs who were known as <ea/>akidas to use it as a language that will unify the pe
ople in the administration of their policies <#/>This was also adopted after Tanzania or Tanganyika became a British colony after the First World War <#/>Now during Tanganyika\rquote 
s struggle for independence Kiswahili was adopted as a language of the leading A
frican political party known as TANU Tanganyika African National Union <#/>This party was in itself led by elitist Africans among them was Mwalimu Julius Nyerere who are who had uh gone through uh the British I think education system so he was an elitist 
<
#/>But when he was picking on the language for his party he decided to pick on uh Kiswahili which was more uh understood by the masses than English or any other foreign language <#/>Now at independence of Tanganyika in nineteen sixty-one Kiswahili was des
ignated Tanganyika\rquote 
s national language and in nineteen sixty-seven a <-/>a bill of parliament made Kiswahili the official language of Tanzanian Union <#/>So it had now become a union After independence there was the coming in of Zanzibar <#/>So the Tanzania
n Union in nineteen sixty-seven comprised of Tanganyika and Zanzibar and its language official language became Kiswahili <#/>Now Nyerere himself the first president popularised Kiswahili so much as a language of government and administration <#/>He decide
d
 to make all his public speeches at least within Tanzania in the Kiswahili language <#/>And he encouraged all the government officials to use Kiswahili as the language of government activities <#/>So as we're going to see is that uh Nyerere's uh political
 
credentials his political charisma had uh very much been promoted by the use of Kiswahili language I think uh we were able even us we were able to hear Nyerere on the radio every day addressing the nation in Kiswahili language after the news from Tanzania
 
which was something very popular <#/>So Nyerere himself also as an elite decided that books that were used in Tanzanian education system should be translated into the Kiswahili language <#/>I think he even uh translated some Shakespearean works into the K
i
swahili language uh <#/>An example I think is uh The Merchant of Venice and uh Julius Caesar <#/>So he was leading that the books that should be used in the Tanzanian system be it foreign books or books written within the Tanzanian state should all be in 
Kiswahili language <#/>Uh in his uh political philosophy of uh socialism Nyerere also directed that the language to be used in the communes that language that should be used in uh the villages known as <ea/>vijiji }{\b\v <&/>Kiswahili: \rdblquote village
\rdblquote }{\v  }{was to be Kiswahil
i language <#/>So when Kiswahili is now used in the villages it's acted more as a maybe a unifying language <#/>It was going to be uh at the disposal of all the people because the village in Tanzania at that time was actually the base it was acting as the
 
base of the Tanzanian economy <#/>So from nineteen sixty <-/>sixty seven also the Tanzanian parliament became uni-lingual after that uh declaration after the I think Arusha Declaration the Tanzanian parliament became uni-lingual <#/>It started using the K
i
swahili language as the language of parliament <#/>The parliamentary debates in Tanzania are in Kiswahili language and most of them are aired on uh <./>ov over Radio Tanzania unlike the case maybe in Kenya where we hardly hear of uh the parliamentary spee
c
hes or debates or contributions <#/>He also set up translation committees in specialised areas <#/>Of course English continued to be used in courts of law in Tanzania until recently but uh with time now there is this gradual use of the Kiswahili language 
i
n courts of law in Tanzania <#/>And uh right now what is remaining in Tanzania is that English is used formally at the university <#/>So at the primary school level at the secondary school level there is more of uh Kiswahili being used in uh <-/>in Tanzan
i
a <#/>So I want us to maybe look at this as uh a political move <#/>Is it a political move <#/>Is it elitist as we <-/>we saw uh maybe from the title of this paper <#/>Maybe I could ask my colleagues to respond to that <#/>Do you see any elitism in the ch
oice of this uh uh language of Kiswahili in Tanzania <#/>What are the political implications here 
\par <$C> <#/><O/> but I could maybe say that uh actually the way we know Tanzania it has so many languages and that uh the <-/>the <-/>the<-/> the choice of Kiswa
hili I may not <?/>know the reasons why Kiswahili was picked but <./>whe when we consider the people who <-/>who actually picked on Kiswahili that initially uh it was the language of uh a political party a leading political party at that time and therefor
e
 <./>th that actually brings in the <-/>the political affiliation and that uh Mwalimu Julius Nyerere actually was an <-/>a <-/>an elite and that he picked on Kiswahili uh of course with the reasons that it is going to unite the Tanzanians uh<#/>I think up
 
to that there is that political aspect of it and when we consider the people actually who were popularising Kiswahili uh I tend to think it is it has that uh elitists' overtone in it <#/>I actually I do not maybe believe that Kiswahili was accepted uh by 
the people of Tanzania <#/>I\rquote 
ve talks earlier that uh Tanzania was composed of so many languages uh <#/>I <-/>I do not believe that most of them actually came at a consensus to agree that now they <-/>they needed uh a language to unite them <#/>So the fact 
that it was picked and popularised by a certain group of people I think it brings in the idea of imposition the idea of uh politics and policing in it
\par <$D> <#/>I think uh I <-/>I agree with you to a large extent on the idea that the initial the initial ide
a of uh <./>i imposing Kiswahili was the to <-/>to be able to communicate and the <-/>the elitists' attitude came in initially <#/>But uh gradually as you see the development what happens then that once this Kiswahili becomes the only form that used to be
 used even uh the level where it\rquote 
s now being used in primary and secondary school as uh official language <#/>I think we are breaking away from uh from the elitist attitude and spreading the language to the masses <#/>In other words now it ceases to become 
an elitist uh tool of controlling or rather ruling uh the <-/>the minor uh over that the majority <#/>And uh we now look at it in terms of giving information knowledge and power so to say to the entire nation that is the majority <#/>So uh it might have s
t
arted as an elitist attitude but uh if you look at the <-/>the <-/>the <-/>the policies that Nyerere was trying to propagate the ultimate goal is that he was trying to break down from this elitist attitude and uh and <-/>and <-/>and <-/>and enable or rath
e
r give the power to the people <#/>That is where actually this aspect of socialism comes in <#/>The socialist attitude was there where there <-/>there was almost an equal sharing of power and of course uh property within society <#/>So in order for him to
 
achieve that form he has to break this elitist attitude of what was in the case in Kenya where we had that democratic so to say society where we have people uh grouped according to classes but the socialist breaks this down and uh therefore the way he had
 to do it was to use this language official language planning <./>po uh policy which uh enabled even the majority to be able to be uh communicating and also own property uh within uh the nation as such I don't know but that's the way I\rquote 
m looking at it <#/>I\rquote m looking at it from elitist to uh say elevating everybody to the same level 
\par <$B> <#/>I think uh the choice of uh Kiswahili language in Tanzania goes back to the colonial times as I said earlier and uh it's had a firm base even before being chosen as the
 language of Tanzania <#/>It was wide-spread in this country <#/>However the role of the powers that be cannot be downplayed }{\b\v <&/>lexeme}{ <#/>Fasold traces the languages' colonial legacy the languages' colonial history and I quote }{\b\v <&/>quote}
{\v  }{<#/>End of quote <#/>So I think uh we have seen the reason why it was chosen <#/>It's had a long history <#/>It had uh a base <#/>It had already established itself among many people even before it was being chosen I don\rquote 
t know if there is any question again up to there
\par <$C> <#/>I don\rquote 
t know whether the argument was what <-/>what I was trying to reason that what if you look at Nyerere apart from the long history as you were saying Nyerere is actually trying to propagate the aspect of socialism the socialist belief and uh in 
so doing he is giving knowledge or rather he has to get the whole people behind him rally the whole nation behind him So does this bringing in the elitist <./>atti uh concept in 
\par <$B> <#/>I think it is uh the light in which we view Nyerere as a person <#/>
Because however much convincing he could have tried to be maybe he wanted to be a socialist in uniting his people in uh setting up a social maybe a socialist society in Africa or a socialist country <#/>But uh all in all Nyerere remains an elite <#/>He is
 uh <-/>he's <-/>he's <-/>he's even a doctor <#/>So when we just look at his credentials only uh they make him an elite <#/>So whichever thing he\rquote s going to do we\rquote re going to look at him as an elite <#/>We\rquote 
re going to look at him as a politician 
\par <$A> <#/>He\rquote 
s an elite that is <./>gra <./>gra granted nobody is uh disputing that <#/>The question that he is asking is was Kiswahili an elitist language itself <#/>Nyerere <?/>and the English is just as efficient in using English as he is in using Kiswahili <#/>If
 it was the elitist uh uh motivation that he had he would have opted for English <#/>Why did he opt for Kiswahili <#/>Compare that with Kenya <#/>KANU KADU in the fifties during the fight for independence used Kiswahili too didn\rquote 
t they <#/>But why did we o
pt for English as the official language at independence <#/>Why <#/>So compare Tanzania compare Tanzania and Kenya and then see why <#/>Why Kiswahili in Tanzania and English in Kenya <#/>That's the big question <#/>And that's why that is uh uh uh forever 
r
eferring it to the socialist orientation of Tanzania as opposed to <-/>to the capitalist orientation of <-/>of Kenya <#/>And that's why you were also talking about Fasold's reference to Kiswahili having had a base in <./>Kisw in <-/>in Tanzania <#/>So tha
t
 the choice of Kiswahili as a national language in Tanzania was almost uh a foregone <./>con conclusion <#/>And the fact that Nyerere was <-/>was using it an <./>e <-/>an <-/>a <-/>an elite himself gave Kiswahili prestige so that it moved if we use this <

\b\v <&/>pause}{ <#/>Okay }{\b\v <&/>pause}{
 <#/>As a continuation of that point uh despite the torture that is a characteristic of the slave master relationship <name/> exposes dependency of the master on the slave so that Prospero <-/>does dares not uh cannot overstep his bo
unds in dealing with Caliban because murdering Caliban would be an act of pure suicide <#/>We realise that in uh our text there is a <O/> that uh the <-/>the <-/>the there is a stretch uh a place where he says that uh uh killing uh no sorry he says that n

 <#/>And the politics of the island are <./>pres presented as parallel to the state which is <./>ab absolutely run by one man that is Prospero <#/>Therefore Prospero has no need of bureaucrats <./>b because Caliban is his friend which me
ans among other things his physical survival <#/>He and I quote what Prospero says "But it\rquote s <-/>it\rquote s we can\rquote t miss him <#/>He does make our fire thatch in our fire uh our roof and serve in offices <#/>That <O_>}{\b\v several words}{

 <#/>So in a nutshell we can say that <name/> draws attention to the uh to Prospero\rquote s fears of his subjects that is he cannot he is not confiden

 <O/> got them from <#/>You know they were not a people they were just children of nature before he came <#/>So he actually constantly reminds them of their past }{\b\v <&/>pause}{ <#/>Uh we can say that uh as a <./>s }{\b\v <&/>pause}{
 as a continuation that <name/> draws another parallel between survival of Caliban between the survival of Caliban and that of the savage that is the deformed and the

<O/> <#/>You realise that this book is actually referring to is a prophetic word to the colonialism that was to come <#/>So I\rquote m saying that as Caliban in The Tempest the slaves were }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{
 worked and were rebellious and often went wild in the spirits of freedom and were imprisoned and yet they carried on they survived as though they were they had some divinity which made them believe in their capacity to last }{\b\v <&/>pause}{
 <#/>The next points can uh be that <name/> also draws from the uh contrast of attitude between <name/> and Prospero <#/>It is this contrast of attitude towards a common disaster as <name/> puts it 
in which uh which introduces the noble and compassionate nature of <name/> on the one hand and the supernatural power of the father on the other <#/>So we can say that <name/> brings out a similarity between Caliban and <name/> that is Caliban uh <name/> 
and Caliban have a bond which is not easily broken <#/>They are alike in their ignorance and there are parallels in their response to strangers from the world beyond these shores <#/>For example uh <name/> is surprised by the fact that Ferdinand knows }{

s a pioneer of it because the issue of the exile shows that even in Africa we had some kings who were in exile <#/>For example he gives that example of Asantehene and Churchill <#/>So that when Prospero comes it shows that th
at is like the imperial centre or now that the centre is coming to the periphery <#/>So in the periphery there is a form of ignorance so that innocently Caliban shows the secrets of the island <#/>So what Caliban is doing is that he\rquote 
s showing his true feelings <#/>There is no hypocrisy in him <#/>But the centre is portrayed as something hypocrisy because after being shown all the secrets the colonial subject is turned into a servant <#/>And this servant whatever language he\rquote 
s being given is only just enough
 to serve colonist master <#/>So that we see that what <name/> is trying to show is that the centre had nothing to offer the periphery and in fact he shows that all Prospero did was out of cruelty and revenge for what had happened to him in Milan

\par <$C> <#/>Yes yes please
\par <$?> <#/>Uh I think Prospero uh in <-/>in some instances tries to subdue uh Caliban and to this extent we can say that he\rquote 
s a challenge that needs to be overcome Uh The margin has always been uh The <-/>the periphery has always been uh a force to be subdued uh in the building of the centre And uh if for one instance then like Caliban\rquote 
s case it fails to be defined uh it fails to be defined as in Caliban always uses that language that he\rquote s learned from the master to insult him Uh this is something that <-/>that uh Prospero himself cannot uh cannot explain So that\rquote

\par <$C> <#/>Yeah yeah I <-/>I <-/>I think basically that\rquote s how you <-/>you <-/>you can <-/>can go about it Maybe <-/>Maybe he\rquote s centring especially on this e

th But uh you are right when you bring in <O_>}{\b\v several words}{\v 
<O/> And he tries to define it If you <-/>if <-/>you go back to that document uh sorry that uh discussion by <name/> you know the title of that thing is I think A Monster a Child and a Slave And I t

s going to be in the same <-/>in <-/>the <-/>same in the same uh uh uh you know par or something like that So we must find a definition that suits this creature uh a slave because we must appropriate the ser

several words}{\v <O/> trying to <-/>to think of uh the commercial element you know One of them says I think if one can trace this creature and take it back he can send them for uh you know as a gift for a king or something like that So it\rquote

 I say that from the imperial side the younger generations have always been good about with a lie such that the only perspective they have of the periphery is the one they have been given They have no experience of their own So that those younger generati

drug haul <#/>We find that the person who got in all those tons of uh <-/>of drugs is uh <-/>is not really the person who is going to take it uh <#/>So uh what I would say is that uh actually drugs permeate you know all areas of society <#/>The rich take 
it <#/>The <-/>the poor take it you know <./>su uh such that we will not really come up with any tangible uh you know solution to drugs <#/>Drugs are there to stay }{\b\v <&/>laughter}{ 
\par <$B> <#/>Are you suggesting what we are doing we\rquote re looking for solutions is that we basically we are doing nothing
\par <$?> <#/>Uh actually <./>le let\rquote s not cheat ourselves <#/>Uh The best we can do is to try and educate people of <./>o on the bad aspects of <-/>of drugs <#/>But even in education we find that in the universities the <-/
>the <-/>the pinnacle of intellectualism we find drugs are being taken there uh <#/>So okay the solution in <-/>in <-/>in this drug war is actually education you know changing the people\rquote 
s uh frame of mind concerning drugs but not necessarily increasing people\rquote s income <#/>That will only give them more money for drugs }{\b\v <&/>overlap
\par }{<$B> <#/>Okay <#/>Now uh that was one way of bridging the gap between the poor and the rich <#/>And also his point maybe as we have said earlier is that most of the people who end 
up taking drugs have other problems that lead them to taking drugs <#/>That is the person maybe uh doesn\rquote t have a job <#/>He\rquote 
s an idler <#/>Or the person is frustrated <#/>He comes from a broken-up family and he has no hope in anything else <#/>So because 
of that he <-/>he seeks for refuge in drug taking <#/>So maybe among those ones who come from that calibre of those who are pressed to drugs by poverty and frustrations that are money-related they may end up in that <#/>Let\rquote 
s get the last one <#/>Now that we <-/>we go to something else so that we can get something else
\par <$?> <#/>Okay <#/>Me I think that uh the families should play a very important role because one of the causes of drug addiction is that children are influenced by their peer groups <#/>So if 
parents can play a role of being responsible and educating their children making sure they know where they are going and what they are doing I think it can be eradicated 
\par <$?> <#/>Okay that\rquote s <#/>Do you know that many parents do not like even to mention drugs to their parent }{\b\v <&/>lexeme}{
 because it may be out of that curiosity that the child would go to look for those drugs to see like you have no intentions of taking heroin for example but you wouldn\rquote t mind seeing how it looks like <#/>Just the way we don\rquote 
t like dead people <#/>But if you are told somebody is dead somewhere you will all go to see him <#/>And your seeing does not bring that person back <#/>Like in the same <-/>same case when you
 introduce the same the issue of drugs to your children some of them instead of getting <./>rect uh corrected they might say uh <#/>Why is mom or dad so concerned about this <#/>And that one might end up making them try <#/>And that is the same problem we
 have with sex education in Kenya <#/>Churches are arguing that if those issues are mentioned to them some of the people who not have had a chance to hear are now going to have a chance to hear and then try it 
\par <$?> <#/>Sir uh actually I have a <-/>a point to add onto that <#/>You know at times you find that uh taking a drug can be an a necessity <#/>It can actually be dictated by your circumstances <#/>Here I\rquote m talking about uh in the past MUSO }{\b\v

 <#/>Now first <-/>first of all I want to comment about the musicality of this <-_>of this<-/> poem because d
ue to the effect of alliteration and repetition and the rhymes okay <#/>This kind of musicality in the first place makes the child derive pleasure from this kind of poem and therefore the child rather is encouraged is encouraged to keep on reading and rea
d
ing and reading the poem <#/>The child is encouraged to read the poems and in that course of reading the poems the child uh comes across different structures of language different words of language and therefore that builds his linguistic <-_competency><+
_competence> <#/>And that\rquote 
s all we are interested in <#/>Now apart from that the child also learns to distinguish closely related words as we found in the poem for example ears and years round ground mouth south and so on and so forth <#/>Okay <#/>So these 
closely related words uh <#/>The child learns to distinguish these closely related words <#/>And also I\rquote 
m interested in uh in the paradigmatic contrast in these kind of words <#/>The child learns that although these words are so closely related as far as p
ronunciation is concerned they are they are very <./>diff they a they have very different meanings <#/>So that closeness in pronunciation or even the same pronunciation does not necessarily mean that the words mean the same okay <#/>So the child comes to 
u
nderstand this kind of difference through the poem and therefore this also has a way goes into uh improving his linguistic <-_competency><+_competence> <#/>Orthographically these words are as you've seen like in this poem of elephant of elephant uh mouse 
house grass trees as you all realised are very commonplace words they\rquote re <-/>they\rquote 
re things that are just around okay <#/>And I would say are words which the child in one time or more often than not will want to use them either in writing or in <./>s speaki
ng <#/>And especially in writing because uh uh if a child wants to express himself through writing then he has <-_>he has<-/> to know the he has to know the <-/>the <-/>the <-/>the spelling of these words <#/>So what I'm saying is such a text also helps t
h
e child to know the <-/>the <-/>the <-/>the spelling of the words of the common or the words that are very common so that he can use them in his <./>co in his communication <#/>Now if we look at this poem of uh the poem I've just read to you The Little Fi
sh The Little Fish <#/>In this kind of poem we have basically three characters <#/>We have the mother fish the little fish and I will say uh is it they call it the persona or something <#/>In other words there there\rquote 
s a kind of a dialogue in this kind of te
xt okay <#/>And in the dialogue of course the mother fish and the little fish speak different at least as far as the tone is concerned <#/>So uh through <./>rea through reading this poem the child uh uh the child tries to fit into the various characters t
h
at are portrayed in the <-_>in the<-/> text okay <#/>And he speaks he has to assume different roles in order to portray the right kind of emotions and the right kind of message <#/>So through doing this the child uh through doing this the voice modulation
 
and all that the child uh the child builds his emotions <#/>And he's able <./>t and he <-/>he knows that communication is not <-_>is not<-/> just about just words or sentence structures of anything it also has to do something with emotions okay <#/>It has
 to do with emotions <#/>And again role play if you look at this kind of text again role play that it helps a child to get the feel of things okay because as I've said as the child tries to fit into <./>dif the different roles }{\b\v <&/>coughing}{ an
d express different emotions he <-/>he learns how to express himself emotionally okay <#/>He learns how to express himself emotionally <#/>And therefore uh this also I believe goes into uh improving the <./>l the child's <-_competency><+_competence> in la
nguage }{\b\v <&/>pause}{ <#/>Any comment as far as that is concerned }{\b\v <&>pause}{
 <#/>Now of course lexically if <-/>if <-/>if you look at the lexical level of this you'll realise that as you've said the words are very commonplace words the house the mouse the grass th
e mouth the ears and so on <#/>And so the child learns the basic vocabulary okay <#/>And he not only learns them he also learns how to spell them okay <#/>So uh so that when the child wants to use them when the child wants to write he can write them witho
ut making mistakes <#/>And that is all that uh <-_competency><+_competence> in language is all about <#/>I invite questions }{\b\v <&/>pause}{ <#/>Yes Epher
\par <$B> <#/>Maybe if it if I did hear that in order to discuss I have not really seen the meaning part of how th
e child learns meaning from language in most of what you've been saying <#/>Are there any instances whereby the child gets meaning to really get the meaning of the language like through a poem how does he conceptualise meanings of things and all that or i
t doesn't appear in linguistic competence 
\par <$A> <#/>}{\b\v <&/>coughing}{ Okay I talked a bit about meaning especially when I was talking about uh the cognitive level <#/>But my view of meaning was this my view of meaning is that I <-/>I <-/>I first I said that the

y <#/>But uh through or with within that context the child is able to will be able to get the meaning of <-/>of such terms and therefore he builds his competence and I gave an example of keeping vigil although the child did not know what to keep vigil is 
what to keep vigil means yeah but within that context he still can be able to <-/>to understand what it means
\par <$C> <#/>Let me say <#/>Okay that's my I have a different view about how a child can get the meaning of words not only from the context <#/>We have
 like for example the onomatopoeic words <#/>And we know with the onomatopoeic words we get the meaning out of kind of we perceive the sound of the word and now we associate that sound with <-/>with the really with the reality the <-/>the <-/>the <-/>the 
p
hysical reality that we have <#/>For example let's say we have a word like the <-/>the <-/>the rock falling with a thud and that I don't know how <-/>how he knows it because there is an there is no <O/> at the end <#/>And uh the child does not know the me
a
ning of that thud <#/>But I think he can picturise how that rock fell and I think it's through such an onomatopoeic word the child can derive the meaning <#/>So I think that it's not only the context that can help a child to get the meaning but also the n
a
ture of the words themselves like for example onomatopoeic words <#/>Also for example we have these words with sibilants for example with these hissing sounds like buzz and any other sibilant <#/>I would feel also because they also appear like <./>onomato
 onomatopoeic words they can also enable the child to get the <./>co to get the meaning of the word I don't know that's my feeling 
\par <$B> <#/>Yeah okay uh I agree <#/>So far we had the meaning of the words that was concerned <#/>But now I was talking about t
he whole text like that poem of the fish <#/>Does the child now can the child understand like if you go against your mother's orders something bad can happen to you <#/>You know like is that meaning more of linguistic or is it <O_>}{\b\v several words}{
<O/>
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang1031 {<$A> <#/>Now tell us what you think <#/>Do you think this meaning is more linguistic
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<$B> <#/>I think in linguistic competence it counts <#/>Like in the child really gets to know the <-/>the gist of the <-_>of the<-/> poem and all just apart from knowing the mean
ings of the words and the sounds and the whatever you have discussed which is okay 
\par }\pard\plain \s17\fi-283\li283\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang1031 {<$A> <#/>Okay
\par <$B> <#/>You also know the gist of the poem so you understand and that is also linguistic competence
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<$A> <#/>So what the child comes to know that uh it's not
 just uh <./>s linguistic structures it also has to do with the meaning <#/>So actually uh in <-/>in <-/>in <-/>in <-/>in communication the child has to know that he has to communicate I mean 
\par }\pard\plain \s17\fi-283\li283\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang1031 {<$B> <#/>Yeah <#/>I\rquote m asking is it okay 
\par <$A> <#/>Yeah <#/>I think it is unless anyone else <#/>Yes
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<$?> <#/>I think now the discussion we must digress a bit here <#/>There's the problem of a kid who is trying to learn L one and 
one is trying to learn L two <#/>Now the question there seem to be having problem with a kid learning an L two <ea/>sio }{\b\v <&/>Kiswahili: isn\rquote t it}{
 so that he doesn't know the meaning of the words so for the first time he's trying to <O/> from other things <#/>Now what of a kid who is learning L one who already knows the meaning of such words }{\b\v <&/>pause}{ 
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang1031 {<$?> <#/>I\rquote m not sure if I'm getting you the question right
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<$?> <#/>The question is this We have a kid who is learning language <#/>Now language can be learned
 from two perspectives <#/>You it can be a kid who is that one now is English <ea/>sio <#/>What of if it was an English kid who is trying to learn his own language or mother tongue <#/>Then there is one who is an African like you who is a young kid trying
 
to learn English <#/>Now in that case I think context would be more relevant to a kid who is learning L two than the kid who is already learning mother tongue <#/>Now a kid who is learning mother tongue already knows the words <#/>Now there must be someth
ing else he's looking for maybe like sequence or anything 
\par <$?> <#/>Yeah I think I <-/>I get what he's trying to say uh you know the question that she posed was <#/>Is there much more to I mean uh is <-/>is I mean meaning <#/>How does meaning come out of th
at text and uh you have we've tried to get uh an understanding <#/>Now the question he is asking is that suppose there is this child who uses the native tongue and he already knows the meanings of these words and everything uh he knows the meaning apart f
o
rm that is there an aspect or other aspects of language that the child learns out uh uh <-/>out of this text of the poem I just read <#/>And of course I think the answer is yes <#/>There is much more I think language is a very wide thing and there are so 
m
any other things people have to learn all the time <#/>And so I think some of the things we pointed out when we were dealing with the phonological level other aspects such as what uh the sense of what uh spelling and so many other things that you were tal
k
ing about are <./>im uh crucial here uh <#/>The child learns other ways about how to speak the language how to write it down how to you know uh distinguish between certain words that are common and that kind of thing that have certain features but that ar
e
 almost similar <#/>So I think there are <-_>there are there are<-/> so many things that a child can learn even if he already knows the meaning of those words <#/>So that uh of course we are saying at the end of the day we are talking about meaning <#/>Yo
u
 have to communicate <#/>But again we are also talking about the process of tackling of getting to the meaning the structure of the language and learning so many aspects about uh the structure of the language <#/>So I think uh this question is just a way 
o
f asking what other aspects are there apart from uh just doing this for basic meaning <#/>And I think it's part of what you are doing now <#/>What are can a child gain from uh the poem itself <#/>Then I also wanted to point out that there are also other t
hings the child can learn when we're talking about meaning because I think meaning is a very wide thing <X_>}{\v 
uh A child that may already know the meaning of words but there are certain levels of meaning such as I think rhythm <./>crea may create a certain kind o
f meaning For instance if you have those poems where the rhythm is so directly related to the <-/>the meaning of the context that is being created by the poem uh we <-_>we we we<-/> talked about last time about this <-/>this train that is moving up the hi
l
l and the rhythm is slower but when it comes down the rhythm gets faster So meaning can be seen here in terms of perhaps really also in terms of just perhaps just the mood that is created How do we effect a particular mood because I think you talked about
 
the intensity of emotion So I think that also has to do sometimes with meaning So meaning can be a very wide thing Uh it may be the words themselves It may also be other <-/>other <./>abs abstract ways yeah in which we want to look at texts That's my idea
 
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang1031 {\v <$A> <#/>Anything else Yes 
\par <$?> <#/>I think just to add on what the lecturer has said this meaning can only be uh achieved through the <-/>the tone <-_>the tone<-/> at which okay the <-/>the tone with which a person talks For example you can have an Afri
can child and just like we have said that okay most of the African languages are generally agglutinative okay they are <-_>they are<-/> tonal languages Like in <-/>in Dholuo you can have one word which <-/>which has <-/>has got three meanings depending on
 
the <-/>the tone you are using okay So I think another <-/>another aspect of <-/>of meaning another aspect of or another aspect through which you can derive a meaning from a text is through the use of your tone You can use that <-/>that angry <-/>angry to
n
e Okay you can use a tone to <-_>to to<-/> one particular tone which is quite different from a <-/>a <./>an another <-/>another tone you have used to bring out specific meaning And the child can easily read it from your tone to know which kind of meaning 
you're bringing across

 and corpus planning <#/>So you can deliberately make the language a prestige language even when it was just uh a mere vernacular <#/>So Nyerere with his charisma gave Kiswahili status <#/>Not that it was a status uh it was uh uh first a status symbol and

\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang1031 {<$C> <#/>I think maybe we should give him time to talk about the Kenyan case before we
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<$A> <#/>But you know the Kenyan case don't you <#/>Ben is not going to give you that now is he Ben <#/>Okay give then just an overview of what uh the situation is in Kenya 
\par <$B> <#/>Now the situation in Kenya is uh <./>di is slightly different is actually different from the Tan
zanian one <#/>I think when we talk about uh politics we're talking about ideology <#/>So the approach at the Kenyan independence in nineteen sixty-three was kind of uh that capitalist orientation but uh as I said earlier the first president of Kenya had 
always been stressing on the use of Kiswahili language as a national language in Kenya only that uh it\rquote 
s never matured and it has not matured up to now because of some reasons <#/>Now in nineteen sixty-four for example uh I gave that example earlier it is a
fter addressing the first Kenyan parliament when Kenya became a republic uh Kenyatta himself used the English language but at the end of his speech he decided to augment it with uh a few words in Kiswahili <#/>And he said that uh a time has come or a time
 
had come at that time to start using Kiswahili language at the national level <#/>And according to him <./>s uh something has to start somewhere <#/>So according to him the use of Kiswahili language has to start from the Kenyan parliament <#/>He proposed 
u
h the discarding of foreign languages such as English uh to proclaim what he referred to as proper independence <#/>So if Kenya had uh become independent from the British uh forces then it had to look for a language that was more of an African language to
 
use in its government policies <#/>But uh the problem came in that unlike Tanzania Kenya had a <-/>a capitalist's political ideology <#/>It uh had uh a balance uh its balance was more towards the West than uh the case of Tanzania which was more towards th
e
 Eastern bloc maybe if you can remember the <-/>the division of the world at that time in the Eastern bloc and the Western bloc <#/>So the Western bloc uh type of capitalism which was being adopted by the young nation in Kenya was that of using the langua
g
e of the former colonial power <#/>So in Kenya it became inevitable that English occupied that special place of its uh in its political ideology at that time unlike Tanzania which discarded the use of English immediately at independence but Kenya continue
d
 using the English language to promote or to proclaim its political ideology <#/>Kenyatta tried so much to introduce Kiswahili as the president of Kenya <#/>He even uh stage-managed I call it stage-managing the introduction of motions in parliament to dec
l
are the Kiswahili language as the language of parliament such that it becomes the language of uh use mass use in Kenya <#/>This was uh attempted in nineteen sixty-nine when a motion <-_>a motion<-/> in parliament passed by uh one MP at that time to declar
e
 Kiswahili the language of the government debate in parliament or parliamentary debate <#/>So it's never succeeded of course at that time <#/>And later on the ruling party at that time and after this time is KANU so at that time it was the sole ruling par
t
y uh proposed in its governing council of nineteen seventy that nineteen seventy-four was going to be the year for the <-/Swahlanization> of <./>Ken Swahilianisation of Kenya <#/>So they they wanted to introduce Kiswahili as the language of Kenya by ninet
e
en seventy-four that was in nineteen seventy in a three-phase plan according to what they gave <#/>So when nineteen seventy-four reached nothing much had been done about this <#/>So since it was a <-/>a government uh a governing council declaration or pro
p
osition Kenyatta decided to make or to give a presidential decree that uh from now that was in nineteen seventy-four Kiswahili was going to be used in parliament So it was a presidential decree <#/>It was not even something planned <#/>So it was overnight
 that Kiswahili had started to be used in the Kenyan parliament and uh there were so many effects on uh that were brought about by this presidential decree <#/>Because according to the literature I\rquote 
ve come across many of the MPs at this time members of the 
parliament did not have proficiency in Kiswahili <#/>Of course there were a few who had proficiency in Kiswahili and no proficiency in English but the majority of them had proficiency in the English language <#/>And the language that was supposed to be us
e
d uh before somebody is nominated to parliament or nominated to contest a seat was English language <#/>So here the president comes and declares that Kiswahili language is going to be used here and it caused a problem <#/>It also it <-/>it is also seen th
a
t uh in uh the struggle for independence many of the political parties at that time I think we had the main political parties KADU and KANU had used Kiswahili language in uh uh propagating their policies in trying to be the leading political parties <#/>I
 
think this implies that uh the political parties themselves were aware of the fact that uh Kiswahili language was much more understood or was much more spread among the masses than uh the English language was <#/>So it was ironical that at independence th
e
 same <-/>same political parties I think KANU had now merged with KADU in nineteen sixty-four <#/>But it became ironical that instead of adopting the language they were using in propagating their policies in the field that is uh among the electorate they 
n
ow decided to adopt the English language as the official language of Kenya because of the ideology that was capitalist ideology <#/>Now in nineteen seventy-nine I think Kenya had uh entered in its second phase now <#/>Uh Kenyatta was uh already out so he 
h
ad died and we had uh a new president in nineteen seventy-nine <#/>So the government of Daniel arap Moi introduced a new bill in parliament from nineteen seventy-four to nineteen seventy-nine it was only Kiswahili that was used in parliament <#/>So in nin
e
teen seventy-nine the government of uh Daniel arap Moi introduced a bill in parliament which <./>in reintroduced the use of English language in parliamentary debate <#/>But this time it did not drop Kiswahili <#/>So it made the two languages as official l
a
nguages in the debates of Kenyan parliament <#/>So the difference was that when a member asks a question in Kiswahili he should answer he should be answered in Kiswahili <#/>When a question is asked in English the reply should be in English <#/>That was t
h
e only difference <#/>But the two languages uh from nineteen seventy-nine I think up to now are the official languages of the Kenyan parliament <#/>Nevertheless Moi himself has continued using Kiswahili in his political platforms <#/>I think that was from
 Leitham <#/>He has continued using uh Kiswahili in his uh political platforms <#/>And he has always
\par <$A> <#/>That didn\rquote t have to come from Leitham because you are better placed to say that <#/>It didn\rquote t have to come from Leitham because you are better placed to say to tell us that <#/>You listen to him every day on <./>tel TV and radio }{

\par }{<$B> <#/>Yeah but uh the uh of late he has been using other languages hasn\rquote t he }{\b\v <&/>laughter

\par <$B> <#/>Okay but he <-/>he stresses that uh Leitham himself stresses that uh Moi has been against the use of foreign languages in Kenya and uh he has always been sayi

i
en to him but he's very very particular about the use of his own language so he'll better use Kiswahili language the way it is supposed to be in standard form <#/>But if he uses the other language in any other way he's not moved about it so easily <#/>I t

theless been uh not been as well implemented as it has been in Tanzania <#/>English is still used in many official functions in Kenya <#/>It is used in courts of law <#/>It is the one that is used in the school the education system <#/>And uh because of u

\par <$A> <#/>I think I would say in in connection to what uh we have just said about uh this
 uh what <name/> has called is calling an unknown it is an unknown history of future intentions <#/>Uh maybe when you think of that statement and you know that it uh against what we were doing this morning uh The Pantomime <#/>What can you say about it <#

\par <$C> <#/><O_>}{\b\v several words}{<O/> you\rquote re still thinking about that uh <O_>}{\b\v several words}{
<O/> <#/>What about this <-/>this <-/>this issue that <name/> says Caliban contains the seed of revolt <#/>What do you make of that <#/>What <-/>What does he mean that Caliban contains the seed I think of s e e d sorry of revolt of rebellion for that matt
er }{\b\v <&/>pause}{ <#/>Yes
\par <$?> <#/>I think what <name/> was trying to show is that <#/>He was showing he had a reference to the slaves who had been taken to }{\b\v <+_article>}{\v  }{<#/>Caribbean so that after the torture he underwent there was always that spirit of freedom
 <#/>He wanted to be free <#/>So that even when they were working he said some of them became leaders <#/>They led an uprising or something like that <#/>So some are killed but still in their position others arose <#/>So in Caliban there are two times whe
n he tries to organise a revolution so that he once overthrew Prospero <#/>But the way he undergoes this is that he tries to use <name/> to seduce Stephano who is the drunkard <#/>But even the two do not have the purpose <#/>They don\rquote 
t know what this revolution is all about <#/>To them it\rquote s just an adventure so that what <name/> is seeing that the colonial subject in this case because of that need the urge for freedom he\rquote 
s always determined so that he shows it the way Caliban was detained in that <O/> so tha
t that detention in itself gives the colonial subject time to think and reorganise himself so that even in detention that spirit is not killed but <./>in <./>in instead it is strengthened more <#/>So Caliban stands for that seed of revolt and that revolt 
is revolutionary in itself
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang1031 {<$C> <#/>Yeah <#/>Yes please
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<$?> <#/>I also tend to think that that seed of revolt which <O_>}{\b\v several words}{
<O_> to be contained in Caliban <#/>Uh I think it refers to the awakening of this <-/>this subject uh that gradually uh by 
using the language which Prospero gives him we see Caliban uh learning or praying <#/>We see Caliban stand up for his rights <#/>He <-/>He tells Prospero that Prospero has misused uh the <-/>the generosity of Caliban to mislead him <#/>Because we can say 
t
hat initially it was him who <O/> Prospero on the island and showed him the good parts of the island <#/>Then after that it is when Prospero now turns things over and becomes the <-/enslaver> of Caliban <#/>So there is that awareness of disposition on the
 part of Caliban <#/>And then he knows that uh Prospero is oppressing him when he\rquote 
s not supposed to be doing that because the island belongs to him <#/>So gradually you see that uh Caliban begins to seek ways of trying to change this state of events so that
 he can now be the rightful owner of the island <#/>I think that is what refers to uh what is referred to as the that seed of revolt 
\par <$C> <#/>Yeah I guess so I mean throughout the play really the colonial discourse that Caliban knows is that of trying to 
assert uh the rights of <-/>of <-/>of <-/>of <-/>of ownership of the island <#/>I mean he keeps on singing this freedom song <-/>freedom <-/>song even though <O_>}{\b\v several words}{

\par <$A> <#/>When we were coming up with that point we realised that uh uh as we were saying that <name/> is trying t

\rquote t matter whatever he\rquote 
s doing to whatever is going to happen to the people but provided they land in the island in the mission of civilising them <#/>And therefore the analogy was uh with this European shipment of uh with this African shipment of slaves to <-/

but uh their <-/>their colonisers had an intention of civilising them because they had this mentality that Africans are idle so you have to make them busy <#/>So by taking them to Europe they are making them busy but it doesn\rquote

\par <$?> <#/>I can also add on that on the question of a new meaning in this <#/>So he tri
es to show the humanity and the inhumanity <#/>So Caliban in the book has been presented as not human <#/>He just lies in between and Prospero now is the human <#/>And you know that what makes a man human is his conscience so that but so that in this case
 
we are <./>s <name/> subverts the situation showing that Caliban instead is the one who has this conscience because whatever he says he <-/>he portrays his true feelings <#/>But Prospero in trying to discover the secrets of the island <#/>He was somehow u
s
ing tricks so that at the end of it he has no guilt when he says that <-/>that the colonial master or the imperial has no guilty conscience is that when Prospero discovered everything about the island he used that information for his benefit and the rewar
d for knowing this is turning <#/>Caliban into a servant <#/>So that in the long run who is human between the two of them <#/>Who has the conscience 
\par <$C> <#/>Yeah <#/>There There\rquote s this other issue you know uh <#/>They prepare again for another possible te
mpest as they go back to <-/>to Milan uh uh <O/> at least uh optimistic of the language of uh Ferdinand and <-/>and Miranda <#/>But uh Caliban is left behind <#/>I <-/>I don\rquote t know <-_>I don\rquote 
t know<-/> if we can think about it especially with regard to what <name/> is saying <#/>You need not write another text you know by Shakespeare\rquote s <O_>}{\b\v several words}{<O/> <#/>But I think that\rquote

s this issue you <-/>you everybody departs and Caliban is left on the island <#/>Has he then finally taken possession of the island <#/>Uh What\rquote s the <#/>How do you <-_>
do you<-/> read that <name/> says that Caliban is not going to be the same again after this conduct <#/>How do you understand that <#/>Why is he not going to be the same again and yet all these colonialists have <O_>}{\b\v several words}{
<O/> <#/>All these fellows have you know departed <#/>Why is he not going to be the same again <#/>What does he mean by that <#/>Could anybody try it say something about it }{\b\v <&/>pause}{
 <#/>What <.-/>What does he mean <./>th that that conduct was enough uh and Caliban is not going to be the same
\par <$?> <#/>I <-/>I think uh Caliban cannot be the same again because we notice that Prospero has a complete influence over him<#/> He completely changes him uh from a <-/>a savage monster into a human being and that woul

and the other people leave the island and he remains on this island we definitely know that Caliban <O_>}{\b\v several words}{<O/> that island the same way as he did before Prospero came onto the scene <#/>So I think that\rquote

<O/> centred on uh constructing uh what okay the centre you know is okay revolting against uh Prospero You realise he\rquote s doing Whatever trick he\rquote

\par <$C> <#/>Yes please
\par <$?> <#/>I also tend to think that uh initially when Prospero was nwe on the island he\rquote s welcomed by Ferd
inand Now that he has had a very rich experience with uh with uh Prospero uh Caliban is bound to be cautious when dealing with different people He\rquote s not <-/>He\rquote s <-/>not likely to <-/>to treat them as he had treated Prosperus before
\par <$C> <#/>Yeah I mean yeah You <-/>You can take <O_>}{\b\v several words}{\v <O/> there there\rquote s this uh this risk business of trying to <O_>}{\b\v several words}{\v 
<O/> Shakespeare But I think we <-/>we <-/>we are forced to do that you know by the invitation of <name/> himself I mean he\rquote s trying to see
 uh you know the consequences of this conduct in terms of uh the current uh condition of uh post-colonial peoples So I <-/>I think we are trying to <-/>to imagine beyond uh the imagination of at least we are <-/>we <-/>are using language and that\rquote 
s why I <

taking things with <-/>with a lot of consciousness you know in spite of the mess that we keep finding ourselves in But at least it is that history that has conditioned us history of authority of you know cultures of domination and <-/>and all that And so 
that any other projects and designs and plans that we have for <-/>for our future we\rquote 
ll always be backed against you know the contact between Caliban and Prospero us and colonialists and so forth Uh well We normally say that history does not begin with <-/>
with <./>colonial colonialism or with the contact with the west But in a sense there\rquote s a special way in which post-colonialists begins with the contact with the west Everything was never the same and so forth I think whenever you\rquote

it was just too late <#/>By then it was it took only a few minutes or a few days before the boy finally hanged himself <#/>So such like situations are exactly what we\rquote

\par <$B> <#/>All right <#/>That
 would be a good issue or a <-/>a good undertaking <#/>But remember we said in the morning that there are people who commit crimes so that they go to jail <#/>And when they are in prison for one month they ensure they commit another crime when they come o
ut so that they go in <#/>Because in the jail they <-/>they <-/>they don\rquote t fetch for their own food <#/>They don\rquote t pay for shelter <#/>They don\rquote 
t care about clothes <#/>So if they were jailed for ten years they know those are ten trouble-free years <#/>I ju

ou know you can choose not to sleep on a bed and sleep on the floor and be comfortable if it\rquote 
s your own choice <#/>The same case somebody who will go to prison because they want that they will not feel the punishment <#/>And we have people who have problems
 family difficulties what <-/>what <#/>So if they know that they can be admitted into a rehabilitation home if they are known to be taking drugs and therefore they will have escaped from their homes and go to a better situation <#/>Don\rquote

\par <$?> <#/>But sir I suppose that those who\rquote ve been admitted to these homes will be a good example for the rest <#/>We\rquote ve <./>ha seen this in the past <#/>Now the reason why I\rquote m so muc
h against this whole issue of sending somebody to uh let\rquote 
s say jail is that when they go there even criminals they meet better criminals than they are and teach them even new techniques of committing even more serious crimes <#/>So by the time somebody leaves the prison he\rquote s even more harded }{\b\v 
<&/>grammar}{\v  }{criminal than he was when he went in <#/>So I suppose that if you take these people to rehabilitation centres as much as he feels that he should go there he will go there but then there he\rquote s not going to lea
rn the new techniques of taking drugs <#/>But she is going to at least be taught of the new techniques of running away from the drugs <#/>So that would mean that if somebody goes there possibility of him changing there <-/>there is uh uh higher then possi
bility of him changing when he is in prison 
\par <$B> <#/>Okay <#/>Good <#/>I think what we do now we write a few points so that uh then we can start something else <#/>But when it\rquote s discussed this way I\rquote m sure when you face these kind of arguments you\rquote ll be be
tter off <#/>One of the things that I would like to say <#/>Most of these are things we have discussed <#/>The first thing that should be done is that the State Department of Justice and Defence should cover all entry points as it has been said to ensure 
t
hat importation of drugs is stopped or minimised <#/>Entry points should be covered to ensure that uh importation of these drugs is stopped or minimised <#/>Secondly the society should fight against the inhuman situations that lead to drug taking such as 
u
nemployment poverty and uh the <-/>the <-/>the issue of street children because these are the people who are used to experiment on anything <#/>Such that if the society fought such uh inhuman situations then you are sure that many people will be leading b
u
sy lives and they have no chance for drugs <#/>Thirdly I think that citizens should be entitled to clear education on the effects of drugs on themselves and the society <#/>The citizens should be entitled to clear education on the effects of drugs on them
selves and on the society <#/>Like most drug takers think that what they <-/>what <-/>they }{\b\v <&/>stammering}{\v  }{
<#/>They are taking their own drugs <#/>They are not affecting anybody else <#/>They are using their own money <#/>They are using their own bodies <#/>
And therefore it does not affect anybody else <#/>So it <./>d <-/>it <./>d depends on them <#/><-/Fourthly> there should be open reorientation clinics where addicts can be helped out of the problem <#/>This is where most people who are addicts instead of 
putting them into jail as one of uh our colleagues our friends has said here they <-/>they should be given uh they should be given a chance where they will explain what led them to taking drugs so that you see whether it\rquote 
s a problem you can alter or it\rquote s so
mething that you can take care of <#/>Like if somebody <-_end><+_ends> up taking drugs because of being disappointed by a friend that is somebody who is different from somebody who ended up taking drugs because of family frustrations <#/>Because that one 
who ended up to drugs because of a friend he can always get another friend <#/>But that one who ended up taking drugs because of family problems you cannot get another family <#/>If you start another one you have now two families <#/>But if you\rquote 
re a member of a family you are a member forever <#/>So you <-/>you saw that you see how even if it\rquote s a matter of linking the person with the family and see how you\rquote 
re going to take care of the situation <#/>Fifth heavy penalties should be imposed on drug traffickers 
and manufacturers <#/>Heavy penalties should be imposed on drug traffickers and manufacturers For example the seizing of their property <#/>The government if you are a drug trafficker and you are caught so that you can serve as a lesson to the others all 
y
our property <#/>The government should take it that you have <AmE/>gotten your wealth from selling of drugs <#/>Therefore they should just get all your wealth <#/>And when you are poor and you will have no more money to go and import other drugs so if now
 
you end up as a drug addict because of frustrations then now we can take you to a rehabilitation centre <#/>And if you are rehabilitated maybe you will stop taking the drugs <#/>Sixthly the youth should be encouraged to seek higher goals in life than plea
s
ure and comfort <#/>The youth should be encouraged to seek higher goals in life than pleasure and comfort <#/>So that what one is looking for is just feeling nice <#/>And as soon as one has found comfort <#/>You <-/>You come from a family that is wealthy 
you will have a car and you did not work for it <#/>You <-/>You <-/>You have money you did not work for it <#/>You just go to <-/>to either your father\rquote s or your mother\rquote 
s shop you open the cash box and <-/>and get two or three hundred put in your pocket <#/
>And uh the employee cannot stop you because maybe you are the only child <#/>And the only way to correct you is if you change your own goals Such that it is not anybody now changing you so that you see you have your own respectable life to lead <#/>But w
hen you think you are living for other people or all your dreams are ever one day having a car When you find you have that car and a posh house if there are posh houses for that matter If when you find you have them that <-_mean><+_means> you don\rquote 
t need anything else you can go drinking <#/>You can take drugs <#/>And the situation where you\rquote d not know the effects people land up in problems <#/>Unless somebody has a question on that affair I\rquote 
d like that we go to something else so that we start our discussions
 on homosexuality and lesbianism <#/>Our friends might be wondering what we learn in this class <#/>We seem to be dealing with the negative issues that is the morality things that uh affect our society <#/>Yes 
\par <$?> <#/>I think that uh if let\rquote s say drug has to be eradicated then we even have to <-/>to stop let\rquote s say uh uh diplomats you know in the higher hierarchy of uh the government from let\rquote 
s say taking uh you know refreshments like whiskey you know such a liqueur you know <#/>Because actually uh drug <./>y you <-/>you cannot really define a point that uh this is where you know uh uh let\rquote 
s say such innocent liqueur stop and this is where drugs begin yeah <#/>So inasmuch as we may want to educate uh people on drugs but uh we can only reduce the number of drugs but we can\rquote t eliminate it <#/>It\rquote s part and parcel of society 

\par <$B> <#/>There is as you said there is one problem i e that the government gets a lot of taxes from uh such drugs as alcohol <#/>In our context it falls under drugs because its effects are
 almost similar to the other drugs It will cause family <./>break uh <-_breakages><+_breakage> <#/>It will cause character disorientation and all those kind of things <#/>But if you imagine the kind of money the government gets from Kenya Breweries you
\rquote d be joking to tell the Kenyan government to ban Kenya Breweries so that people stop taking beer <#/>And furthermore the policy makers our politicians most of them are drunkards <#/>They need it <./>th <./>th the way he needed it }{\b\v 
<&/>laughter}{\v  }{so <-/>so that they can tell us lies and not feel guilty you see <#/>They <-/>They <-/>They will need that one <#/>And when we talk of diplomats or people let\rquote 
s say representatives of other governments in Kenya <#/><./>Tho Those ones have some sort of immunity <#/>You don\rquote 
t interfere very much with their private affairs <#/>You <#/>We have a case at hand <#/>The Rwandan diplomat who was accused of uh attempting murder <#/>When the government refused to undress him of the immunity so that now the Kenyan government can put h
im into court the best they could is deport him <#/>They couldn\rquote 
t put him in court of law <#/>So that is the kind of security that diplomats have because without that one you cannot be sure of the security of your people whom you have put everywhere <#/>Yo
u have some in America Canada where Saudi Arabia <#/>If you are not sure that nobody will interfere with them you will not have so many diplomats scattered all over the world <#/>But you know even if they\rquote re commit they\rquote 
re committing a crime it will be wai
ted until they have finished their work or the government response will be to withdraw them from those countries <#/>When they have been withdrawn then they are going to be accused <#/>But you cannot be anywhere then you\rquote 
ll be caught and put in <#/>So we a
re saying that such people if they are taking drugs in their place if they come here where they stay is part of their country by the way <#/>The compounds they have been given that is part of their country <#/>Therefore if they are free to be taking drugs
 
in Canada or America or where when they get to that residence of their own they are as free as they were when they were in their country to do what they want to <#/>They have no obligation to change their character because they are in <-/>in Kenya for exa
mple <#/>So they\rquote ll be free to take whiskey <#/>Whatever else hard alcohols }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{\v  }{they want to take or dry gins as they are called <#/>They will be free 
\par <$?> <#/>So in other words <O_>}{\b\v several words}{<O/> uh should not just be <O_>}{\b\v two words}{<O/> but also drugs <#/>We can\rquote t escape it
\par <$B> <#/>Uh It\rquote s difficult all right but what we are saying is it\rquote s something that needs attention <#/>At least especially drugs that get to a limit of spoiling a family an individual is something that should concern }{\b\v <&/>stammering}{
\v  }{should concern us <#/>And for leisure purposes alcohol still remains moral 
\par <$?> <#/>Yeah <#/>I think this point of youth being encouraged to seek higher goals <#/>It\rquote s like these are idealistic views since that how <-/>how can we be able to uh <-/>to help them have a higher uh higher goals of life since especially <O_>}{

in subject and publisher order <#/>And let the type of order you choose for your operation zone that is your main area of the bookshop <#/>Let it match what is in the stock so that a book which is which a customer asks for can easily be located inside the
 stock <#/>To conclude I\rquote d say that the sole purpose for a display is to enable you to sell your goods to customers as quickly and efficiently as possible <#/>It\rquote 
s there solely to tempt the would-be purchasers <#/>All in all what really matters is the approach to display <#/>Unless anybody has questions 
\par <$B> <#/>Yeah I would want us to visit the <-/>the <-/>the <-/>the window where you have titles displayed <#/>I want us maybe to go and brainstorming on uh <#/>How should it exactly look like <#/>What could we include so that we really want to arrest }{
\b\v <&/>lexeme}{ this person who is passing by <#/>What things should we include uh together with books that we want to display <#/>What do we regard as crowd-pullers <#/>Something like what we said the card shops but 
what else could we include in the window 
\par <$?> <#/>}{\b\v <&/>beginning inaudible}{ power should have neon lights uh in order to attract <-/>attract the customers 
\par <$?> <#/>Yeah though for neon lights I think you have to be a bit careful with them because some tend to obscure the real mission of your work }{\b\v <&/>pause
\par }{<$?> <#/>And to add on that it\rquote s very important in fact it\rquote s a <-/>a another point by itself for the prices price tags of your books on the displays <#/>I think they should be very much attractive and rea
dable from a<-/> from afar so that they really entice the customer so that the customer will not be uncertain of what to meet inside there <#/>Not to meet wonders <#/>He just go surely knowing that this book is twenty shillings <#/>And he finds <-_>he fin
ds<-/> that it\rquote s twenty shillings not going there to expect something else
\par <$?> <#/>Won\rquote t you discourage them from coming into the shop <#/>Many <-/>Many of the shops I\rquote ve seen don't tell their customers this book is five hundred shillings <#/>they won\rquote t enter the shop 
\par <$?> <#/>But I think uh <#/>As for that one I think it\rquote s very much and subjective because for the <-_>for the<-/> customer to feel whether this book is just too expensive I tend to think that one will be an in-pass-by <O_>}{\b\v several words}{
<O/> because for somebody uh <#/>Let\rquote s say somebody does medicine <#/>He surely knows that medicine books are very expensive <#/>So the price will not do any harm to him
\par <$?> <#/>I think the uh including the price in the display is a very good idea because not so
 uh okay <#/>You may not have the money when you are going to <-/>to buy a book <#/>You might <-_>You might<-/> have a book in mind but in the process of looking at the display you find a different book <#/>So you are not planned for that <#/>But if you k
now the price and maybe you have a chance you know to scan uh and read maybe the blurb and think the book is good you know whether to bargain <-/>to <-/>bargain for it or not <#/>So I think the price is <./>i important and then again maybe when you
\rquote re buying a book you\rquote re not <-_>you\rquote 
re not<-/> only buying it from one uh maybe bookshop <#/>There are so many bookshops in town <#/>Uh You <-/>You can compare prices <#/>It <-/>It uh <-/>It helps you a lot instead of going to <-/>to maybe shy off }{\b\v <&/>stammering}{ <#/>If it\rquote 
s not included you might shy off uh to ask to the counter because you are not <-_>you are not<-/> even intending to buy it <#/>You don\rquote t have the money so you you\rquote re <-/>you\rquote 
re even afraid <#/>Oh if I ask uh maybe these guys will tell me Oh how much do you have <#/>And you can bargain and strike a deal or something <#/>So I think uh including the price is okay 
\par <$?> <#/>It\rquote s even more convenient for you to see for yourself the price rather than go disturb those people <#/>You see to you how much it
 would be more like disturbing them <#/>And they are very much uh I mean most of them they are very arrogant although that\rquote s the wrong attitude
\par <$?> <#/>Okay there is }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{ two aspects which pricing can discourage <#/>For example uh most books went by <O_>}{\b\v several words}{<O/> <#/>Then you know people get influenced by what they see first isn\rquote t it }{\b\v <&/>grammar/tag
}{\v  }{Say like I see and the first book I see is seven hundred and twenty-eight shilling because this bookshop is very expensive <#/>That might affect me for a very long time <#/>Then what I suggest is we should not do away }{\b\v <&/>prep}{\v  }{
the prices but }{\b\v <&/>grammar/subj}{ should not be so much highlighted <#/>You know like all that we see is price not the books <#/>You just see the books there but you 
have prices and you have got good ones but not so much highlighted so that if I want to know the price on the books as he says I move forward and check the price <#/>But not that I\rquote

c
an we maybe look at uh can we maybe cite other factors other than politics that have uh popularised English because if it was just solely politics that is concerned with language planning then I don't see the reason why Kiswahili has not uh been so much p

<$D> <#/>I think we talked <-_>we talked<-/> about uh ideology <#/>I think that is still going back to politics <#/>But I think uh in Kenya we maybe look at uh the functions that uh English plays as the official language <#/>I think the functions are more
 
and if we look at uh the functions not all of them can be said to be political <#/>Like if we say English is the language of the labour system in Kenya I don't know whether that is political or how we say that English is the one that is being used in the 
educational system though it is <-_>it is<-/> still the the government that implements this 
\par <$C> <#/>So what we are saying is that }{\b\v <&/>clears his throat}{\v  }{I want to although this could be outside of what we are saying but uh what the politicians are trying t
o do like Kenyatta what he was doing was actually cosmetic maybe to <-/>to <-/>to get the support of the people <#/>But in the real sense if he really wanted to implement the use of Kiswahili as a national language he could have succeeded because he was j
u
st maybe going to parliament only when there are so many other arms of the government so many other spheres in <-/>in <-/>in <-/>in the society that could maybe promote Kiswahili for example in education <#/>Even up to recently like in our education syste
m
 we didn't Kiswahili was not examined at what primary school <#/>And yet the <-/>the same politicians actually were uh trying to <-/>to show the people that they were really for the African language that was Kiswahili <#/>So I <-/>I look at it as cosmetic
 <#/>They were really get trying to get the support of the people but they were not serious enough to promote Kiswahili as a national language 
\par <$D> <#/>I mean that comes down to the same thing but uh we have got the <-/>the elitist trying to exercise power over the <-_>the the the<-/> majority <#/>That is actually what it waters down to because if you look at it I\rquote 
m trying to look at it from the point of view of the <-/>the few Kenyans who have been educated at independence and the others that went out after independence those the organised what do you call the flights

\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<$D> <#/>the air-lifts to the US <#/>Most of uh uh those personalities went out they came back and uh very few if any were propagating the aspect of us using Kiswa
hili or indigenous languages apart from the time as you said that they when they wanted to go in to ask for the votes from uh their constituency <#/>So uh ideally uh in Kenya the use or rather language planning or planning as a process has been used uh to
 
exercise a kind of control uh especially in the past where we were not exposed to information and that is exactly what is happening right now that uh you find that uh the mass media particularly the radio is still governed and controlled by the government
 and uh this has not enabled us in fact that might be one of the reason why Kiswahili has not spread out as much because some people are very good in speech that if you gave him time to speak in Kiswahili uh give him air time in Kiswahili he\rquote 
ll talk so much
 and so well that at the end of the day he might end up discrediting the same <-/>same uh uh arm that gave him the uh <-/>the <-/>the <-/>the allowance for the air waves <#/>So I think there has been this control there has been this exercising of power by
 
the elite over the majority <#/>There is uh a status quo that is trying to be maintained by using uh uh language-planning processes <#/>Uh So as much as we are advocating uh that we want everybody to become educated we want everybody to become literate I 
t
hink in Kenya as you put it it's really cosmetic <#/>And uh apart from the fact that <./>Kiswa uh English has several other roles to perform I think we can also pick up like Tanzania we are not any less uh than what Tanzanians are <#/>We can also pick up 
but I think that idea of trying to maintain that uh difference in terms of uh economic uh classes and maybe political groupings and then we have to bring in the aspect of language planning 
\par <$B> <#/>I think we can look at Kenyatta as a man who was uh in two
 linguistic camps maybe for <-/>for his own political gains <#/>First of all here on the other hand on one hand he was uh promoting the use of Kiswahili through decrees but he never <-_>he never<-/> got down to see the implementation of this in the wider 
p
olitical constituency <#/>And on the other hand he oversaw the use of English as the official language in maybe the official circles the <-/>the parliament up to nineteen seventy-four and the education system <#/>So if we look at him he was trying to main
t
ain his political ideology that is of capitalism because he the <-/>the <-/>the <-/>the government had to use English in order to identify with the West <#/>And when it comes now to the masses themselves when it comes to the vote he had to go back to the 
masses everybody had to go back to the masses
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang1031 {<$A> <#/><./>Wa <./>was was the adoption of English merely to identify with the West

\par <$B> <#/>It had been used by the British colonial powers 
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {
<$C> <#/>And it was actually that it had been socialised into the Kenyans especially those ones at that time of independence they believed that anybody who <-_speaked><+_spoke> English was more competent in terms uh it gave them <./>s <
./>s as we said status prestige power and so on and so forth it was associated with that <#/>So that the <-/>the young Kenyans at independence the <-/>the <-/>the <-_elites><+_elite> took up this wholesale and uh did not try to see the <./>ra rational beh

\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<$B> <#/>Yeah The point I\rquote m trying to make here is that uh because 
of the need for economic development Kenya actually saw the need to use a <-/>a <-/>a <-/>a language that is that had an international perspective 
\par }\pard\plain \s17\fi-283\li283\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang1031 {<$A> <#/>Yeah that is the thing yeah
\par <$B> <#/>and English actually came in handy 
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<$A> <#/>That is the thing <#/>So the emphasis in the Kenyan uh political circles was first economic development <#/>That was primary in Tanzania it wasn\rquote t that <#/>That\rquote 
s where the difference in ideology comes in <#/>In Tanzania the primary purpose of the political the ruling poli
tical party was to develop the <-/>the villages in Tanzania egalitarianism you all know what egalitarianism means <#/>We all share the little that we have <#/>We all have access to it <#/>And then spread political power to as many people as possible <#/>A
n
d how fast how <-/>how can you use the language to do that use the language that most of the people already understand <#/>So when you're talking about economic development economic development of the villages it is not economic development emphasising ex
port trade because in Kenya we're talking about export import trade huge volumes <#/>You can look at the statistics very huge <#/>So you see our <-/>our <-/>our gross national product is huger than Tanzanian\rquote 
s <#/>But when you look at what actually trickles
 down to the villages in Kenya it's negligible whereas in Tanzania you find everybody is getting their little bit <#/>So it <./>i now it's a question of ideology <#/>Which language will help Tanzanians achieve their political goals so they opted for Kiswa
h
ili the language of the masses because it is the masses that they were focusing on <#/>In Kenya it was capitalism which actually concentrates power on the hands of a few <#/>And those few are the few that actually knew English already <#/>And that's why t

 what I wanted to <-/>to see from your paper and I wasn't quite seeing it <#/>It is not necessarily true that that happened in Kenya but that is just one way of looking at it <#/>The socialists like <name/> uh Phillipson that you have also read will give

<$?> <#/>And then uh I want to ask another question <#/>Uh Yes You <./>Yo <#/>Uh How long should the display remain <#/>For example how <-/>how <-/>how much should you change your displays and what should be the time period and reason of changing the
 displays
\par <$?> <#/>The change of the display by the currency of the book and the way the books are selling the rate of selling that is for the book which is selling relatively fast I think most people know that what book that is and it\rquote s good qualities <#/
>But for a book which is going slowly that is selling slowly rather should be displayed at least to create that impression <O_>}{\b\v several words}{<O/> there\rquote s a book there 
\par <$?> <#/>I have another question <#/>Uh now because I\rquote m a uh a regular buyer of books it 
will <-_>it will<-/> reach a point where I might not even be interested in the display <#/>How <-/>How do you maintain that I be interested in the display <#/>How <-/>How <-/>How do you suggest that we arrange uh the new arrivals and the old uh the <-/>th
e <-/>the old uh titles which are still in the display <#/>How do you suggest <#/>Is there a pattern that you can <-_>you can<-/> maybe divide the display section that new arrivals and the old titles 
\par <$?> <#/>That\rquote s a very good suggestion <#/>For us to have divided displays sort of just demarcate like uh sections within the window displays <#/>You put new arrivals <O_>}{\b\v several words}{
<O/> such things <#/>So that when somebody sees these are new arrivals you just come and rush in to see what is there that is so new <#/>Then he just go }{\b\v <&/>grammar}{\v  }{
inside to see the new arrivals <#/>I think that one will be <-_>will be<-/> good to maintain your customers because as far as business is concerned you need to maintain your old customers and to attract new customers }{\b\v <&/>pause
\par }{<$?> <#/>Okay I was wondering in case a bookshop manager <#/>There are some occasions whereby you find that uh uh a book is on display but as soon <-_>as soon<-/> as you go inside inquiring you are told that the book is out of stock <#/>Then I was 
wondering whether it\rquote s good <#/>As <-/>As soon as the book has come out of uh the stock maybe due to limits in supply should we remove the book from the display <#/>Because it might make us lose credibility among the customers
\par <$?> <#/>I think that one is rather subjective but it\rquote s advisable still to put it on the display but }{\b\v <&/>overlap
\par }{<$B> <#/>I <-/>I don\rquote t think it\rquote s advisable to retain it on the display if the <-/>the title has run out of stock because uh it may even affect the good-will that customers
 have towards your bookshop because customers want to get what they can see }{\b\v <&/>pause}{ <#/>What about this <-/>this aspect of uh music <#/>Where do you think we can apply music <#/>It is a shop inside a shop }{\b\v <&/>laughter}{
\par <$B> <#/>But do you think that you c
an have a very small speaker maybe some piped <-/>piped music from uh inside the shop <#/>You could have a speaker next to the <-/>the <-/>the window display with some recording maybe instead of having the new arrival uh new arrivals written on a <-/>a <-
/>a <-/>a poster or something like that you could have a recording that tells people <#/>These are the new books that we\rquote ve uh acquired 
\par <$?> <#/>I think on music I think 
it should still be inside and outside the shop <#/>Outside that the piped music on the window display will be enticing the viewer the kind that is telling people Hey in our bookshop there are only competitive prices why don\rquote 
t you step in <#/>There are new arrivals <#/>Then when they get inside there is cool relaxed music so that they are not in a hurry to choose
\par <$?> <#/>I think also music uh despite uh having it in the <-_>in the<-/> bookshop should also <-_>should also<-/> come in the display <#/>Because uh imagine a situation where I am just walking I\rquote 
m in a hurry I <-/>I might not have the time to look <-/>look at the display the new arrivals and all that <#/>Then something obstructs me some music playing next to the wall and then I look <#/>Oh I find th
at very beautiful and attractive display <#/>Then I <-/>I I\rquote ll <-/>I\rquote 
ll be forced maybe to stop for a minute or two and which can lead even to twenty minutes or something and I can even end up buying <#/>I think that music should also fit uh to the display although not so loud but at least <-_>at least<-/> }{\b\v 
<&/>overlap}{ 
\par <$?> <#/>}{\b\v <&/>laughter}{ And especially in big towns and more so is Eldoret whereby most people who live around <-/>around here they are farmers <#/>Did you take into consideration what you are 
going to put in <-/>in the display the kind of display so that you can attract many different groups of a town
\par <$?> <#/>Yes I think that one is very subjective and depends on the town in question <#/>You see for every town <./>th the people of that localit
y has a certain have a certain characteristic that is <#/>And for the type of business you are in that is the bookshop business you know your customers well because before you established your bookshop you had a market research to ascertain the viability 
o
f the what you are going to do the business you are going to do <#/>And you know the readers who are to be coming to your shop <#/>So it serves to explain that for every area there are customer characteristics and there are things which are unique feature
s which are unique to that particular type of customers <#/>Maybe if it\rquote 
s a highly agricultural area you know they <-/>they might be very much looking for agricultural goods <#/>That one you might have considered before opening your bookshop And that one ca
n be reflected in the <-/biasness> of your stock <#/>You can be highly biased on the agricultural information if most of your customers are farmers I think that one can be taken care of that way <#/>If it\rquote 
s an urban area you have all sorts of styles so you can display the great greatest variety of <./>pos of books possible }{\b\v <&/>pause}{
\par <$?> <#/>Uh I <-/>I want to revisit this issue whereby you say that for if it\rquote s possible whoever is looking at the display should see through the shop <#/>Uh There <-/>There are
 cases where that one might not really be uh positive <#/>It might have a negative impact on the <-/>the people who are seen <#/>For example okay uh as a buyer and ordinary buyers for that matter you <-/>you one <-/>one indicator that the shop is good or 
maybe the books are good is to see uh maybe there are so many people in the shop <#/>But now for example if I see through the display and there\rquote 
s nobody in the shop apart from one uh somebody only seated there at the uh <-/>the <./>ca uh <-/>the cashier the
re <#/>So you can you can imagine although the prices might be good but I wonder Are these uh do people buy things from this shop or not I can <-/>can have that hesitance <#/>So I think uh to an extent also that should be relative <#/>Uh It depends <#/>If
 the buyers are <#/>If it\rquote s an enlightened town society where people value books then that one is okay <#/>But for our case and in most uh places or maybe wherever I\rquote 
ve been working I find it is still applicable to block the display from seeing the shop 
\par <$?> <#/>And I think for that one we use <#/>The problem can be traced back to the <O/> of a book-buying culture <#/>It\rquote 
s almost universal because for most cases you find that there are peak seasons and very low seasons such that even <-/>even in the most co
mpetitive bookshops you can enter and find almost nobody only the attendants there <#/>But in the peak season maybe people are uh schools are re-opening you find all the bookshops are stacked even if they don\rquote 
t have see-through window displays is it <#/>That one is relative to time
\par <$?> <#/>Take for example here in the library <#/>You are not sure whether it's open or not and you come here and you see they have opened the door <#/>Then you see <#/>So you are not seeing the door opened <#/>You are not seeing
 anybody <#/>They could be operating but you are <-_>you are<-/> likely just to go ahead and pass <#/>And if the door was open though there was nobody inside you know they are operating <#/>What I\rquote m trying to say is blocking exactly throughout <O_>
}{\b\v several words}{<O/> are not seeing anything can be a problem also because you don\rquote t know whether people are inside there or not and you don\rquote t want to be the first one to get in <#/>You know that kind of thing <#/>But if it\rquote 
s open at least you see the cashier already maybe one person <#/>You may want <-_>you may want<-/> to get in <#/>Or you may see many people which will be much better for you because so many people are getting in <#/>So I think you should also show that 

\par <$?> <#/>I think it can even serve as a control where the idling attendants the seemingly idling attendants inside there can beckon customers }{\b\v <-/>laughter}{ because they can see them 
\par <$?> <#/>}{\b\v <&/>overlap}{ one thing can attract this one and the other attracts the other one <#/>So that e.g. that person who is passing and does not and sees there is nobody inside <#/>It\rquote 
s like even if that person saw a crowd inside <#/>So it\rquote s like whatever you do you may not actually end up attracting anybody but at least you may attract one person if it's only yourself
\par <$?> <#/>Uh now since there are so many display styles and all that do you suggest that you maintain one routine display or you keep on changing display formats and styles 
\par <$?> <#/>It\rquote s good to have various display styles and keep on changing so that any every time a customer comes he may find something different <#/>Even if he\rquote s used to that place he finds Oh it\rquote 
s quite changed so he wants to have a new taste on things <#/>That way he comes inside
\par <$B> <#/>And even the position <#/>It\rquote s actually advisory to
 change positions of the books so that if you put this book at the right-hand corner this uh for the for two days <#/>Next time you remove it from there take it to the centre or maybe to the left-hand corner <#/>In that way people not even come to think u
h of your bookshop as though it\rquote s holding only in stock books that are not being bought }{\b\v <&/>pause}{
\par <$?> <#/>I have something to say against displays outside <#/>First of <-_>First of<-/> all books deteriorate when exposed to strong sunlight <#/>You know the 
quality of paper is rather poor <#/>Secondly that can encourage shoplifting and other extra expenses for somebody security men to be keeping watch over your items <#/>And they\rquote 
ll still be accumulating dust so somebody has to be there dusting all the times and in <-/>in fact he\rquote ll be obscuring the would-be purchasers when he is dusting <#/>So it\rquote s advisable to have them inside <#/>And then there\rquote 
s the window display
\par <$B> <#/>Well but what do you think about that <#/>Don\rquote t you think having them outside could 
even make the would-be customers feel free to look at the books maybe get hold of them feel them read the back uh look at the pages <#/>If <-/>If you have enough security and if you make the surrounding well taken care of for example if you have a cemente
d area where you don\rquote t have a lot of dust and if you have shades whereby you wouldn\rquote t have direct sunlight uh and uh affecting the books <./>do <./>ca don\rquote t you think that could also be a good idea 
\par <$?> <#/>I think that one can work well in peak season when there\rquote 
s so much activity or when the peak season is just coming to an end and then you want to maximise sales <#/>That way you can have a sort of exhibition just outside in the veranda of the shop so that everybody now can see come have a glance and then
 see there are multitudes of people inside then walk right inside and jostle for a place to just have a <-/>a glimpse of what is in stock 
\par <$?> <#/>I <-/>I feel books need to be taken care of <#/>One when you place books outside there there\rquote s a lot of dust <#/>And you got }{\b\v <&/>slang}{\v  }{
to protect them from dust <#/>Secondly sunlight wind and all that can be very bad for the books and also the <-/>the temperatures <#/>And also when people are really browsing through them it\rquote s likely to tear and wear of the book 
<#/>The mutilation of the book can also take place outside there <#/>So I think the display should be within the bookshop at least not <-/>not outside 
\par <X_>}{\v <$?> <#/>Okay <O_>}{\b\v several words}{\v <O/> maybe one <-_>maybe one<-/> copy of each title <#/>And the process m
