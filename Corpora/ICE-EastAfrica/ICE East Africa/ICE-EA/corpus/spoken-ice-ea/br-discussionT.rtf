\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <I> <$E> <#/>On }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  second of August nineteen ninety Iraq invaded Kuwait and announced the merger of 
the two countries a few days later <#/>In our first instalment in two we examined the Gulf Crisis and looked at its historical as well as economic perspectives <#/>In this edition we\rquote 
ll look and examine whether solutions to the Gulf Crisis must come all the way from the United States and other European countries <#/>Aren't Arabs themselves capable of solving their own problems <#/>As well as that we\rquote 
ll discuss the impact of this crisis on the ordinary man in the street <#/>Taking part in this discussion as 
members of the panel are Chempondo Alec Humphrey Senior Lecturer Department of Political Science and Public Administration University of Dar es Salaam Karim Isaack Lawyer and Editor of Liberation and Ugandan Digest Robert Rweyemamu a columnist with Busine
ss Times and Felix Kaiza Editor of Property Digest <#/>Karim Isaack starts us off as to whether solutions to the Gulf Crisis must come all the way from the United States and other European countries
\par <$B> <#/>Yes uh you know it is very interesting to note th
at when Iraq invaded Kuwait <#/>I think you know Iraq did hint to various people that look if this oilfield issue is settled and this question of the <-/>the <-/>the <-/>the <-/>the <-/>the price of oil is settled and that we owe this ten billion debt is 
s
ettled we would withdraw <#/>On the basis of that Arafat came out with a ten point plan which was supposed to have been discussed at the Arab summit in Cairo <#/>Now some forces came in and that was never discussed <#/>Instead you know the Arab League at 
t
his meeting condemned Iraq <#/>Now there has been a procedure all this time that you never pass any resolution unless there is a consensus <#/>For the first time they use the word majority minority to have in favour eight against and so forth <#/>Right <#
/
>Now this is against the Constitution of the Arab League <#/>In other words there were forces that were working to prevent the Arabs coming to a solution amongst themselves <#/>Even now too there is this plan there is the Arafat plan there is the Ghaddafi
 
plan Arafat uh uh uh uh uh involves the replacement of uh uh uh Iraqi troops uh uh with UN troops or Arab League troops <#/>Ghaddafi has the same idea <#/>Namely that in the case of Kuwait UN troops occupy it and <-/>and <-/>and <-/>and Arab League uh occ
u
pies the uh that the <-/>the uh uh <-/>the troops that occupied Dubai now by US may be removed and Arab League now takes over <#/>In other words this is now the Arab League solution promoted by certain Arab countries including the PLO <#/>But if you read 
the latest issues of Newsweek America has made it quite clear whether Saddam <-_Husseins><+_Hussein>withdraws or stays in Kuwait they are staying put in the Gulf <#/>And today BBC announced that Baker has addressed the Congress Committee
\par <$A> <#/>At the tim
e I was in the United States of America myself and uh there had been this Middle East war uh <./>w uh the Arab countries had come together denying oil say to the United States of America because Israel had attacked <./>the there <#/>Now one thing which He
n
ry Kissinger then uh uh <./>S State Department Director or Minister for Foreign Affairs of the United States under President Nixon had said something <#/>He said that uh these Arabs must release the oil with immediate effect otherwise we are coming to tak
e it <#/>And that uh the excuse he made was that uh we cannot accept the economic strangulation from anybody <#/>So this probably means that the United States has had under its sleeves }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>idiom}{\fs24\lang2057 
 a concocted plan to be in the Middle East effectively and uh this Iraq-Kuwait situation provides the panacea for the American presence and since it has also been crowned with the dignity of United Nations resolutions to that effect then uh it\rquote 
s a dignified thing and they are there and if they say they are there to stay uh the United Nations has in a way supported them
\par <$E> <#/>But uh what surprises me is why have the United why has the United States come out so strong uh against Iraq\rquote s invasion of Kuwait because there was this package that was from the United States a
nd yet another from the United Nations <#/>Did this situation really warrant such harsh repercussions Felix
\par <$D> <#/>Well I think uh the whole question is uh <-/>is the question of oil That must be the point at issue because uh uh one uh should remember th
e uh Saudi Oil Minister saying uh we have become an integral part of the oil-market of the US and the return on our investment depends on the health of the market <#/>Now uh there can be no other explanation uh to the present crisis <#/>These people are l
o
oking for the oil <#/>They <-/>they want to take care of their interest <./>ir irrespective of whatever happens to the uh common man in the Arab world or in the other parts of the world <#/>I think what uh they are looking for is their economic interest d
erived from oil
\par <$E> <#/>To me there seems to be lack of foresight on the part of the international community because if you remember in nineteen seventy-five seventy-five seventy-six seventy-eight uh we had this inflation that was caused by uh OPEC uh rais
ing the prices of oil and uh the United States and all other Paris Club members thought }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057 
 time was right to begin looking for alternative sources of energy <#/>Now before we've come up with other sources of energy we\rquote ve been caught up in another 
crisis and it looks like the oil is going to go up and the implications are going to be far and wide in fact as far as uh many other developing countries like Tanzania uh don\rquote 
t you think that there was this lack of foresight <#/>Maybe if we had uh been keen enough in those days to look for alternative sources of energy this crisis maybe wouldn\rquote t have meant so much for most of us Rweyemamu
\par <$C> <#/>I agree with you <#/>There is a problem which we have to face uh but uh I don\rquote t know uh what uh poor people like ourselves can do about it <#/>We <-/>we are bound to be victims of the circumstances and uh as it is uh uh I don\rquote 
t know what foresight could have helped because as far as our interests are concerned we have no <-/>no alternative the uh we have no other s
ource of oil and uh uh really we have to bear the <-/>the consequences <#/>So <./>rea really I cannot imagine what could be a way out <-/excepti> uh uh uh uh a forced rationing of oil and uh as the government has said a <-/stricty> uh uh uh care in the us
e
 of oil <#/>Actually the truth is as far as uh the main players are concerned in the <./>oi uh uh affair they are not worried about the small people they are not worried about our interest they are worried about their own interest <#/>The big powers the i
ncluding the United Nations Security Council they are not worried about our interests <#/>So really we have only uh <-/>only uh our <-/>our own uh fate to control nobody else can help us in this situation
\par <$E> <#/>Yeah I\rquote m trying to have a vision here uh as
 we enter the twenty-first century <#/>What kind of people are we going to enter in that century with AIDS in our midst <#/>Air fares are going to rise definitely <#/>We have this debt crisis to grapple with and then we have uh events in Eastern Europe wh
ich might rob us of the aid that we were used uh to getting from the Western countries or developed countries <#/>With this crisis going on and we don\rquote t even know when it\rquote 
s going to be over chances are we are going to be more in economic quagmires than anything else Karim
\par <$B> <#/>Yes I think it is a challenge to man and woman not only in Tanzania but in all the areas where people are poor <#/>It is a challenge to conquer the forces of nature <#/>It is a challenge to conquer uh the problems of society <#/>No
w take for instance Tanzania <#/>Now we have coal and we have got a burning coal and uh you know it requires of course a certain degree of investment in the coal but I\rquote m quite sure that if it's set about seriously about it }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 
<&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  we could be able to develop our coal industry and then uh not completely destroy our impact on uh the oil prices but we\rquote 
ll be able to soften part of the impact <#/>And as far as the West is concerned and it's not so much what did you say lack of foresight but they realise look
 man if we are going to invest in atomic energy if we are going to be <-/>i <-/>i you know in <-/>in nuclear energy that cost billions and billions <#/>Now why do that when we got uh you know uh uh uh uh Saudi Arabia giving us oil at eighteen dollars a ba
rrel which is very cheap because if we invest so many billions in nuclear look what we get in returns <#/>It'll take years <#/>So that\rquote s one of the reasons why they chose the cheaper option although they went for the nuclear they haven\rquote 
t gone as much because they think in terms of cash <#/>So I\rquote 
m quite sure just like I mean there are countries like you know or I talk about Eastern Europe or even Russia they were backward thirty years ago but because of the creativity because of political organisation because
 of the unity they were able to pull themselves up <#/>And I\rquote 
m quite sure that with correct ideas correct political orientation we in Africa we in Tanzania also must and we will pull uh ourselves up from these problems <#/>All we require is really you know
 first we must have knowledge extensive knowledge of the world around us extensive knowledge of what is taking place uh in our own environment and once that is transmitted to people I\rquote 
m quite sure the people are going to rise and <-/>and <-/>and uh solve these problems
\par <$E> <#/>Mr Chemponda Alec
\par <$A> <#/>Yes uh there is also another aspect I think of your question Edda Sanga and that is uh that as we uh head on toward the twenty-first century uh what is needed I think we need to set our priorities correctly
 uh because uh when you look at one other country uh which is Japan and uh I lived in Japan nineteen eighty four eighty five on my sabbatical leave from the <-_>from the<-/> University Dar es Salaam <#/>I saw a very interesting thing <#/>The Japanese do n
ot have much of raw materials at all natural resources <#/>they don\rquote 
t have much of them at all uh and yet they have uh managed to come out to become a power to be reckoned with uh <#/>We need to <-/>to look at the perspectives of what make Japan what made Japan <-/>Japan and to see why can\rquote t we also make ourselves

\par <$E> <#/>Maybe the difference between Japan and us is that they\rquote ve got the technology which we don\rquote t have
\par <$A> <#/>Yes that\rquote s why I said that uh what we need is the tactics you know to tackle things and to set the priorities properly
\par <$E> <#/>Karim you want to come in
\par <$B> <#/>Yes just come in to say that in 1930 in the thirties Japan also did not have the technology but the Japanese went they told the <slang/>Japs whenever you go to Britain don\rquote t g
o as tourists go and get as much information as possible about everything <#/>Every Japanese went there as a crusader to get knowledge
\par <$A> <#/>And then they were told to come back home and when they came back home you know this is <./>w something which I 
noticed when they came back home they were actually placed properly that if you were an engineer you were given an engineering job if you were if you had this particular expertise you were given the proper possible place where your expertise was being uti
l
ised properly uh <#/>Once you begin to twist people that someone educated in a certain field you put him in another field altogether you confuse them it becomes a problem in their <./>crea creative talents and therefore the <./>curren the country becomes 
retarded a little bit because of misplacement of <./>w the native talents
\par <$E> <#/>Rweyemamu
\par <$C> <#/>Miss Chairperson this is where we have got to take very serious view of our problems <#/>Our problems are not insoluble they can be solved <#/>Dynamic acti
on is required especially in the field of manpower especially in the field of uh talent promoting talented people to use their uh <./>ta talents
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 When we talk of uh calling back Tanzanians who are outside to come back to this country we have talked about it it has been good uh uh national call but very little action has been taken }{\fs24\lang2057 I}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 think this is where we need the uh uh real action not mere rhetoric but real practical action When we call our Tanzanians back we mean if you mean that we should give them th
e proper environment give them the proper attention so they can come back willingly and be able to contribute properly to our development We just can\rquote t talk you know of calling them back when we cannot give them the means even }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/>
}{\v\fs24\lang2057 even the minimum means with which to work So when we talk of technology we can improve our technology by real action not mere words
\par <$A> <#/>And also Edda uh that uh our }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 our country the way I have noticed it in the last fourteen years appears to be a little bit afraid so a little bit shy of it\rquote 
s own uh the <./>in intellectuals in one way or another I don\rquote t understand why I don\rquote t understand really why And in fact uh some at times there have so there have seemed to be uh a concocted well almost like a }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/>}{
\v\fs24\lang2057 a struggle uh the nation
 versus the intellectuals There is no reason for that We need to utilise these intellectuals We need to encourage our people to study as much as possible just like the Constitution of Chama Cha Mapinduzi says that uh in its aims that I will or in its Aims
 
Section seven that I will educate myself to the best of my ability and I will use that knowledge for the benefit of all people and you should believe that these people are going to do that but when we come back and fight these people for reasons unknown t
o me we retard our own progress and there is no reason why Tanzania should be behind at all We }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 we }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 we }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 we have the opportunity and we }{
\fs24\lang2057 <-/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 we can move forward We }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 we really can I know it
\par <$E> <#/>Felix
\par <$D> <#/>Well uh I think uh uh we have now the code of investment uh We can use that code to attract foreign investors but uh what uh has been going on mostly is uh we don\rquote 
t have uh real stock of our experts If you get to fields like engineering myself I had the chance to meet some engineers real p
rofessional engineers uh who have been attached to foreign companies and have done very good jobs the jobs which they were refused when uh <./>th uh <./>w the jobs uh which they were refused uh when foreign companies were not involved uh So uh as my colle
agues were saying uh it is real very important that this country must recognise professions and of course the professionals give them their correct environment and they are able to work
\par <$E> <#/>Okay so as the crisis in the Gulf rages on and as life has to go on what would you suggest a man in the street does 
\par <$B> <#/>Yes 
\par <$E> <#/>Karim
\par <$B> <#/>Before we talk about what the man in the streets does let us now look what the man in the street is seeing And unfortunately we haven't got uh uh all the informati
on that we need from these countries Arab countries But some of the magazines like The Time Newsweek Guardian and others they have now interviewed some of these people and I want to if you like please allow me to quote some of their sayings The Christian 
Science Monitor 
\par <$?> US
\par <$B> <#/>US says The Syrian street is pro-Saddam Hussein Now this is before the outbreaks of demonstrations and support for Saddam Hussein broke out in Harmas in Harma and in}{\fs24\lang2057  }{\v\fs24\lang2057 <-/>in uh}{\fs24\lang2057  }{
\v\fs24\lang2057 <-/>in uh the occupied Golan Heights by the Jew
ish people So this correspondent sensed and came and told the truth and it and what this correspondent said borne out was borne out in practice by demonstrations in Syria for Saddam Hussein and as you know there is no love lost between Assad and Saddam Hu
s
sein So it was a very brave thing on their part to be able to do so Another one New York Times he is saying quoting a person called Mohammed He says Arab leaders who are against Saddam Hussein are worried about their own seats They don't have support of o
n
e percent of the people Saddam is our leader and I would fight for him and remove the Americans and the traitor King Fahd Now I'm surprised he used such a hard word for the word <./>trai describing Fahd as a traitor because this idea I think someone else 
can elaborate on this idea of uh foreigners going to the Holy Land how the Moslems see this But that is one this year 
\par <$A> <#/>Before you continue saying others can elaborate on that, I think Saddam Hussein's point there that has attracted a lot of Arabs is the linkage
\par <$B> <#/>Hmm
\par <$A> <#/>Between his situation and the situation uh of occupation of Arab lands by Israel
\par <$B> <#/>Yes
\par <$A> <#/>Continue
\par <$B> <#/>Right Then Time magazine says some people are saying He says quoting one this he says The oil belon
gs to all Arabs This work is our only chance to develop the Arab world People know that Saddam wants to help the poor Arab nations Now this is from uh uh Time magazine quoting somebody Another man says I will love any Arab leader who will unite the Arabs 
e
ven by force And then somebody said Saddam Hussein made a mistake After Kuwait he should have gone to Saudi Arabia This is uh somebody interviewed says that Other words now I'm <-/>I'm saying I'm not talking about whether it's right or wrong This is now s
ome of the statements the west correspondents have got out from the }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 the }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
the people As far as the Palestinians are concerned you know that in the occupied West Bank and Gaza the Palestinians showed Saddam Hussein\rquote s flag And when they asked look you'r
e spoiling your chances they said We have nothing to lose We have tried everything since nineteen forty-eight and we are in the same So we have nothing to lose in supporting Saddam Hussein
\par <$A> <#/>So to come back to Edda Sanga's you know question What should the man on the street do
\par <$B> <#/>do 
\par <$A> <#/>especially may be in Tanzania probably
\par <$B> <#/>Because what they have done is that they have volunteered They said in Sudan one million have signed on to volunteer to fight In Jordan eighteen thousand hav
e volunteered In one of the demonstrations one tribal leader in Jordan said Thirty thousand members of our tribe are volunteering to fight the invaders He means of course the Americans
\par <$E> <#/>Rweyemamu
\par <$C> <#/>Well I would rather look at this from a leg
al point of view the principle of self determination I think before the people of Tanzania decide really on where they stand in this issue we have to know what is the real feeling of the people of Kuwait I believe there are about my learned brother here w
ill help me two million people in Kuwait
\par <$B> <#/>Oh one point nine
\par  <$C> <#/>One point nine We have not really as far as I know or as far as I am concerned I don't know what is the real local reaction of the people there To be able to decide really what is
 our position in this we must know the people's position that is what they think about the take-over the uh <-/>the nationalisation of their country I'm }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
I'm sure they have their own views and those should matter really and those <-/>those should affect the views of our people here That is my view
\par <$E> <#/>Karim you want
\par <$B> <#/>Yes you mentioned one point nine That's not all Kuwaitis 
\par <$C> <#/>Yah
\par <$B> <#/>one point nine million people in Kuwait are not Kuwaitis As I told you earlier on four hundred th
ousand are Palestinians About seventy thousand are <-/>are Jordanians Then there are hundreds and thousands of you know Thais uh uh Indians Pakistanis and so forth So we could say uh Kuwaiti as Kuwaitis could be about four hundred thousand
\par <$A> <#/>Well then if this is the case you know we are hearing that a lot of these extra people are leaving Kuwait So maybe there might not be uh 
\par <$B> <#/>Have you heard of a Kuwaiti leaving
\par <$E> <#/>No
\par <$C> <#/>Are you saying they are happy with the situation
\par <$B> <#/>But you see everybody else is leaving
\par <$A> <#/>But you see another think to look at I think to answer our }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 our Business Times friend here is that we have not heard any incidents serious incidents of <-_Kuwaits><+_Kuwaitis> real local <-_Kuwaits><+_Kuwait
is> coming up against Iraq\rquote 
s occupation We haven't on the other side we have not heard them demonstrating on the streets in favour of it but we have not heard them saying no to what has happened The only official thing that we have <-_>we have<-/> heard is
 that the new regime has gone to Baghdad and in Baghdad it did declare first the that the Union was a natural thing and that they are one people and they are happy to be together

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <I> <$F> <#/>Food for the Future <#/>But first we must know what is food Dr Bitanye
\par <$A> <#/>I think many people would easily answer this question as anything that one eats in order to nourish his body <#/>But one question arises Do you always get nourishment from
 what we eat or do we always eat what is nourishing uh <#/>From this point of view I think we you all know that food uh can be divided into about four major groups <#/>There are those foods which give us energy and these include things like starch foods c
a
ssava maize uh wheat and the like <#/>And also foods like meat or fat meat which also gives you energy <#/>There are also some types of food that will give you protection from diseases and these foods include uh foods like uh fruits citrus fruits and the 
l
ike and also green vegetables that are said to be good sources of uh vitamins <#/>There are other foods which as we all know are the basic building blocks of our bodies that is proteins <#/>These proteins are essentially the ones which make us grow and re
pair our bodies <#/>From this same point of view we have found that the world at large is having }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 a surplus of food In fact the statistics that we have indicate that we have ten per cent more food than is required in by the population today <#/>B
ut the problem is the distribution <#/>The distribution of food in <-/>in the world even within the same country is not even <#/>As it has been pointed earlier in the discussion those people living in the rural areas are terribly undernourished <#/>And so
m
e of them are in the danger of dying from hunger <#/>From other statistics it is also indicative that generally uh the world consumes on the average uh food that gives them two hundred and thirty sorry two thousand three hundred calories per person per da
y
 of food that give them energy and uh up on the average about sixty-two grams of food that builds their bodies <#/>We in Tanzania are slightly above the average <#/>We have in fact uh two hundred two thousand eight hundred calories per person per day and 
s
ixty-five grams per person per day for protein <#/>This indicates that Tanzanians are generally above average in uh nutrition <#/>But of course generally the distribution of food is not even <#/>So one could find that people living in rural areas or in an
y other areas that are <-/>are poorly supplied with food are terribly undernourished <#/>Some of them may be suffering from of hunger while in other parts of the country other people may be having }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 too much to eat <#/>So here you have the problem
 of undernourishment and of overnourishment <#/>But this is the question that we will be discussed later when we come to look at the major constraints to food production and food uh availability <#/>I should probably end here and leave my colleagues to co
ntinue the discussion before I come in again
\par <$F> <#/>Thank you very much Lothar Bitanye uh for warming up the panel and uh as I can see here uh the faces are shining and showing some sort of a <#/>they have some comments to give uh concerning this first question what is food Uh Mr Manento
\par <$B> <#/>Yeah Thank you Mr Chairman as Dr Bitanye is clearly uh talking about the <-/>the <-/>the <-/>the definition of food I'd rather to like to add that uh uh food is not only uh that one to fill the stomach but food sh
ould contain all essential ingredients in order that it uh may balance the uh the body requirements <#/>Therefore it's is }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 important to note that food should be of should have nutritional balance uh as you can see that uh in some parts of the co
untry you find people suffering from malnutrition while they're surrounded by abundant food uh materials <#/>Therefore it is important to uh note that food should uh be utilized at the level uh which allows the nutritional balance Mr Chairman
\par <$F> <#/>Yeah <#/>Are there any comments uh concerning the first question before we move on to our second stage of the discussion uh Muheto
\par <$C> <#/>Yeah I would like to agree with the Prof Bitanye's Dr Bitanye's definition of food and the elaboration made by my collea
gue Mr Maneto but I should like to add uh on the types of foods which uh conventionally they are not uh thought about whenever people think of sources of food <#/>Uh In the Tanzanian context I should like to remind uh Tanzanians that the <-/>the various s
o
urces of food including include those which are available in the forests uh in the oceans and uh uh in the ocean you would have two types of foods <#/>There are animal foods and plant uh plant foods <#/>Uh I should like to expound on what is available in 
t
he forest <#/>There are plant foods like uh mushrooms uh roots leaves and even fruits uh and also when you look at what the forest contains there are many <-/>many small animals which uh also would contribute much on the availability of food in Tanzania <
#
/>Uh we also have a whole a range of insects which uh are a good source of protein and when you go to the ocean environment you have all sorts of marine organisms the crabs uh <O/> uh oysters squids and what have you <#/>So I should like to expound on thi
s definition of food so that many Tanzanians should not be limited by what is normally obtained on the farm but they should also extend their knowledge about the availability of food in the forests and uh oceans <#/>Thank you Mr Chairman
\par <$F> <#/>Uh Mr Muhe
to you have touched on our second phase of the discussion but before I move on to that uh maybe someone has got a comment on this one <#/>Not at all okay <#/>So I'm just talking of one <#/>We're talking of food uh it means the opposite of which is hunger 
<#/>Now let us look how is hunger related to the quality of environment and uh Muheto you are conversant on this I think since you you're
\par <$C> <#/>Uh Yes I am but I should like to get some comments from uh other discussants if they have something more detailed to tell
\par <$F> <#/>Yeah Kajumula
\par <$D> <#/>Yeah Thank you Mr Chairman <#/>Maybe a point which relates to this is the fact that everybody needs food from the definitions we have got and the common components of food but this food has to be produced or it h
as be tapped from different sources <#/>And the major source being the land <#/>It is the land which is now creating world-wide worries because of the way it is management managed in producing food <#/>I think this is a very important area which has cause
d concern to every government to see if it's possible to sustain food production at the rate the land is being destroyed or at the rate the land is being misused
\par <$F> <#/>Yes Now sometimes
\par <$A> <#/>Yes Mr Chairman I would also like to chip in
\par <$F> <#/>Yes
\par <
$A> <#/>what my colleague has just said that uh really uh the main constraints that uh have uh confronted many developing countries in particular is the way we have been managing our environment uh <#/>Our expert will probably expand more on this but uh y
o
u'll find that uh whenever food production is considered the environment is not uh at the same time considered <#/>Some people would just clear the land plant whatever they can plant and then use as many chemicals as they wish to <-/>to use uh things like
 
herbicides or even insecticides even in fact fertilisers can be quite hazardous to the to the land that produces the food if we are not very careful <#/>Of course my colleague has <./>t talked about the land uh but of course the sea as well <#/>There is t
h
e problem of uh sea pollution which invariably of course uh uh destroys the marine life <#/>There's also the pollution of fresh water rivers and lakes which does the same thing today to the marine uh to the water uh life and the like <#/>Of course uh the 
of question of clearing the forest as well has something to do with it but as I said I'm not the expert on this I'm sure my colleague uh Mr Muheto uh will be able to give us more details
\par <$F> <#/>Yeah the burden has fallen to Mr Muheto but before he chips in but uh Mr Mbonde
\par <$E> <#/>Both my colleagues have been touching this element but perhaps I'll come back a little bit on the crucial question which uh which Mr Chairman you asked in which you said 'what is hunger' <#/>Sometimes it is difficult because thi
s is a psychological feeling or <./>physio feeling which someone experiences due to not having adequate uh food within his body system but the <-/>the crucial part perhaps which we should draw back and try to consider uh why this hunger comes about and uh
 
I think as my colleagues have been touching about the pointed areas where uh the sources of food can be grown or can be obtained <#/>Now the crucial part here we're we are concerned which in one way or another contributes to this uh shortage of food and u
l
timately hunger is of course as it has been explained to be the problem of the environment <#/>This means that we are constraining the environment due to uh either overuse or improper use of the land to sustain various <./>whi I mean various which I mean 
v
egetative growth or any more I mean uh growth within that area and uh these constraints of course <-_is><+_are> attributed due to various factors which some of them are deliberately and some of <-_>some of<-/> them are I mean uh undeliberately due to othe
r constraints which we are having }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 <#/>Since as it has been pointed out that uh in some of our countries there is uh <./>sh I mean a shortage of food though in general terms there is a <-_>there is a<-/> ten per cent surplus but the distribution 
element has been one of <-/>of the <-_problem><+_problems> <#/>Now this one in those areas where the food is not evenly distributed people try to find other means of trying to produce it and unfortunately because these areas are in the rural parts where d
evelopment or technology mean facilities are not available to improve the agricultural or livestock <./>husb husbandry they go into practices which does not sustain though in the >\'b4
<-_>in the<-/> short term they could get benefits from these areas but in the long term they are uh I mean affecting the land adversely to support any future for supplies <#/>Perhaps that is all I would comment for the time being
\par <$F> <#/>Uh thank you very much <ea/>Ndugu Mbonde and I would like to quote uh a sentence from the Wor
ld FAO Journal uh for the Food for the Future which says Environment concerns came to the forefront of international attention at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in nineteen seventy-two which led to the establishment of
 
the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP <#/>Later the same year FAO published its first preliminary backgrounds of the state of natural resources and the human environment for food and agriculture in nineteen seventy-seven <#/>So this shows actually
 uh how important environment is uh to the uh <-_>to the<-/> production of food uh <#/>Let's go back to Muheto
\par <$C> <#/>Uh thank you Mr Chairman Uh before I dwell on this problem of uh uh environmental degradation I should like first to link it up with the 
<-/>the problem of population <#/>As we know uh population is increasing uh in particular in many developing countries if not all uh <#/>In the case of Tanzania we all know that at the time of independence we were around nine million people but now we hav
e
 increased up to around twenty-two point five million people and this is an increase which is still uh uh accommodated in the same area uh <#/>There are some issues which uh I would like to expound also related to environmental <./>degrada degradation par
t
icularly in urban areas <#/>We know that there is a quite a lot of urban rural urban migration and it is estimated by FAO that uh at the turn of the century about forty per cent of the rural population will be in urban areas <#/>So this calls for uh very 
c
areful planning of resource use both in rural areas and in urban areas <#/>Now before I go to the constraints which are environmentally oriented and which uh have a negative contribution to sustainable food production in <-/>in <-/>in our country in parti
cularly I should like to dwell on the <-/>the reason as to why people find themselves to say for example uh adopting bad methods of cultivation
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 We know that one of the reasons for environmental degradation is caused by the need to expend to expand agricultural land and }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
and hence the need to increase food production So if productivity within an area would have increased we would have no problem of uh more expansion of uh agricultural land on virgin forests Uh Secondly most of these uh most of this uh 
encroachment on existing forest is done through clearing of uh expanses of forests and this has got its own dangers If it is done in catchment areas it can easily well lead to flooding or siltation of dams uh destruction of cultivable areas in lowlands uh
 and in certain in certain circumstances it can lead even to drought because uh it changes the uh it brings about an irregular water }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 water flow Therefore I we have to mention this because this is very important Of }
{\fs24\lang2057 <-/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 of course we all know what happened
 recently in Mtwara There were a lot of floods and there are so many theories relating to uh to the causes of this flooding but one of it must be relating to uh uh environmental degradation particularly excessive uh deforestation in the uplands Now I shou
l
d like to say something on uh deforestation in uh semi-arid areas which uh in most cases do <./>i <./>k uh in most cases can lead to desertification We all know that these semi-arid areas are not suitable for agriculture uh uh but apparently some of these
 areas are now uh under agricultural use which we believe from the professional point of view it cannot support viable agriculture unless it is well controlled So we }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 we }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
we extend if we extend this discussion to semi-arid areas the situation of envir
onmental degradation there becomes even worse The other method which I should mention as a major cause of environmental degradation is the failure or the lack of incorporation of uh conservation methods in uh agriculture Here I would like to point out uh 
the long history of what our uh people in rural areas used to }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
to do during the colonial times and even after but now it is no longer there We used to incorporate a lot of soil conservation measures in our cultivation uh things like uh use of <?/>bands u
se of terraces contours, even some intercropping but these are things which are no longer seen now in the <-_>in the<-/> scene in the rural areas scene I think it is a high time that we should address environmental degradation in the rural areas from that
 
point of view Maybe I should also dwell on the environmental aspect of irrigation although irrigation is not popularly adopted in this country but the dangers which are likely to come out of irrigation would be things like salinisation which is an increas
e
 of salt in the ground and also alkalisation and uh we are likely to get many water-borne diseases if we adopt irrigation This is to not to say that irrigation should not be adopted in Tanzania but wherever we do it we should <-_>we should<-/> take into c
onsideration the }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
the likely environmental consequences which are likely to occur with irrigation I've been dwelling on agriculture I should like to talk something about livestock livestock and grazing There is a lot of information on uh livestock grazin
g in arid lands but unfortunately it has not been used very well with our possibly our extension officers But what I should like to say here is that uh livestock grazing in marginal areas in areas receiving say less than six hundred millimetres of rainfal
l
 should really allow migratory movement of animals If we encourage sedentary sort of grazing in these areas we are <-_>we are<-/> definitely going to come up with the serious environmental degradation problems soil erosion sheet erosion deforestation and 
w
hat have you So I should recommend that uh in uh in semi-arid areas we should try to look at land use systems which are ecologically adaptable to the to that environment and here I should like to point out that the use of semi-arid lands for pastoral use 
i
s ecologically recommended uh Mr Chairman I've been dwelling on the agriculture livestock and irrigation possibly I thought I should mention something about environmental problems of uh marine resources because this is also linked up with food availabilit
y
 The main problem we have in the marine areas is the dynamite fishing uh We don't like dynamite fishing It is a very bad practice and this is mainly because it destroys the <-/>the breeding grounds of the <-_>of the<-/> fisheries you know and therefore it
 decreases the catch per }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 per }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 per }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
per fisherman you know catch <-/>catch per fisherman which is very very important And that is why there is a constant reduction in catch the }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 the }{\fs24\lang2057 <-/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
the landed fish per <-/>per fisherman If you <-_>if you<-/>
 try to contact our fishermen and see what they say they will tell you that this is one of the problems and definitely it is arising from dynamite fishing So we think from the environmental point of view dynamite <-/>dynamite fishing should be discouraged
 and if it is impossible all those people involved in dynamite fishing should be arrested and uh given very good punishment for this because it is not a good practice

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <I> <$A> <#/>Hello and welcome to the programme
 <#/>This week in this edition we revisit the University of Dar es Salaam where on twenty-fifth of August nineteen ninety the Prime Minister and First Vice-President <ea/>Ndugu Sinei Warioba held discussions with the University of Dar es Salaam Academic S
taff Assembly
\par <$B> <#/>My name is Alec Chemponda Political Science <#/>Mine is not a question but uh a sort of a proposal following your discussion recently with the uh <ea_>Jumuiya ya Wazazi<ea/> uh concerning what to do with the <-/>the children who finis
h Standard seven <#/>In nineteen from nineteen seventy-six nineteen seventy-eight I was a field supervisor of a political science research uh on evaluation of Norwegian aided projects in Tanzania <#/>And during that time I was able to meet a lot of people
 around the country and one of the things they discussed was this gap between Standard seven and Form one and what to do with the <-/>the children after they finish Standard seven and especially since most of them especially girls are still }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_too>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 young fo
r anything <#/>So parents were very much concerned and since you express this same concern I thought maybe I could bring this proposal which I was very shy of presenting before and I'm only }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>idiom}{\fs24\lang2057 
 presenting it today <#/>My suggestion is that we should 
start uh Standard eight with uh almost immediate effect or it should be started within two years from now <#/>This means that uh the Parliament will have to make a parliamentary act Act of Parliament ah which should uh make this particular change and the 
M
inistry of Education should uh find uh the logistics and the <./>mec the <-/>the <-/>the mechanics for bringing this about <#/>Now the introduction of Standard eight would operate like this in my opinion that uh those students uh who are not selected to g
o
 for Form one from Standard seven should be allowed to continue at the same school into Standard eight and in the year of standard eight they should be allowed to do the Standard seven exam with the <-/>the next uh Standard sevens also <#/>And the selecti
o
n to Form one should be taken from both Standard seven and Standard eight uh <#/>So those who are not selected from Standard seven will go into Standard eight for another chance the <-/>the <-/>the next year <#/>Those who are not of course selected after 
Standard eight they would still have an opportunity uh at least they would be mature enough this time to enter the world <#/>So that uh the parents won't be as fearful as uh they are now <#/>This is uh my proposal
\par <$C> <#/>When I talked to Azazi I was not t
alking about uh Standard Seven leavers <#/>I was talking about the youth <#/>Whether they have completed Standard Seven or Form Four Form Six University we have a problem of employment for the youth <#/>So I was talking generally about employment of the y
o
uth <#/>Right up to now in the minds of many people they think once you are educated to any level you should go into formal employment whether it is in government and the parastatal sector in the private sector get formal employment <#/>I don't know how m
a
ny we get every year out of primary schools secondary schools and uh uh institutions of higher learning <#/>But I know those who are employed in the formal sector in this country it's just a little over seven hundred thousand <#/>We are educating more chi
l
dren more of the youth every year than the seven hundred thousand <#/>So we have a very serious problem of unemployment and this mainly for uh the youth <#/>So I was talking of how we can generate employment for the youth as we should not just look into u
h the formal sector <#/>We should pay more attention to the informal sector and provide the services that are required so that people can use their own initiative especially the youth in gainful employment <#/>That's what I was talking }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>You are 
talking about education uh <#/>Well the acting principal secretary Minister of Education is here <#/>He might take it <#/>I think you can formally follow it up in uh that procedure <#/>I think it's an issue which has been discussed for some time now <#/>W
h
y did we <-_>did we<-/> abandon the Standard Eight System the eight year uh primary school system Why did we did we go into uh the seven four two three or four five or whatever you have but I think that is as you say it is a proposal <#/>Don't expect to m
e to react }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$A> <#/>Members of the University of Dar es Salaam Academic Staff Assembly were not coming out }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24\lang2057  and the Prime Minister had to literally provoke them <#/>Then came this anonymous personality
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \lang2057 {<$D> <#/>It seems to be the <#/>W
e don't seem to be in control <#/>Take this university for example <#/>If you leave out uh the foreign assistance we are getting uh essentially we can't afford the university without the foreign assistance uh <#/>Leaving that aside you go to the other sid
e
 of uh the proper running of a university where you plan you budget <#/>And then you find that the resources which Government gives us cannot allow us to implement our plans <#/>And then we end up with this crisis situation and then when a crisis occurs s
o
mehow resources are available uh <#/>That's what worries me <#/>We <-/>we <-/>we in one way we can we seem not to be able to afford the university in another way we don't seem to want uh <#/>I mean as an uh as an institution of higher learning one would e
xpect it to set an example of proper planning and proper implementation of these plans <#/>And we <-/>we don't seem to be able to do that <#/>Now the environment somehow is not conducive to doing that <#/>That's what is worrying
\par }\pard\plain \qj\nowidctlpar\adjustright \fs20\lang1031 {\fs24\lang2057 <$C> <#/>And I have heard th
e deduction of what you pay as rent which is a large amount as well <#/>It's the use of resources I think when we are in time of crisis sometimes we know how to use the available resources <#/>The vice-chancellor was telling me that the Council has decide
d that staff who are lodged in hotels with effect from next year next academic year 
\par <$?> almost <-/>almost immediately 
\par <$C> <#/>immediately will be given sixty thousand shillings a month to find accommodation and that will serve <#/>I think you are using 
uh for some of them five hundred thousand shillings a month <#/>So instead of using a hundred and fifty-eight million to lodge people in hotels you might save more than a hundred million <#/>You haven't had more resources <#/>It's a reallocation of resour
c
es <#/>Well I don't think that is my really my problem <#/>I cannot sit and think if we think macro-micro <#/>There are macro-issues and micro-issues <#/>Now are we talking globally or specifically <#/>Because it is too general for me to react whether thi
s
 rigidity is a national rigidity or you are saying it is the government <#/>The scarcity of resources that I don't dispute because it is the same argument I could hear from the Minister of Communications that we have so much of roadwork to do the money we
 
are given is not enough <#/>Education is the same <#/>Health is the same <#/>Everywhere <#/>Now scarcity of resources is one <#/>We can talk of how to increase our resources <#/>The use of uh resources is another <#/>Now that's where we might come to rigi
d
ity <#/>Is it at the level of the University because some of the things that you are talking about are at the level of the University <#/>So are we talking about a general attitude of Tanzanians or are we talking of a Department or Government <#/>As I say
 
if you <-/>you I agree with you in times of crisis some money might be found <#/>Fire-fighting <#/>Fire-fighting is used <#/>It's a method everywhere but there are others where within the allocated resources maybe you might have your own rigidity <#/>So c
r
ises sometimes provoke you <#/>I'm sure if things were okay you wouldn't have searched like that <#/>But you have a crisis you try to solve the crisis <#/>So in this case I think what has transpired I think the extra resources as far as I know were eighty
 
million because twenty million <-_was><+_were> the resources of the University <#/>You have had a hundred million <#/>Twenty million came from the resources of the University <#/>The University was closed earlier you had said <#/>So you determined how to 
u
se the twenty million <#/>The eighty million came from the Government <#/>But apart from that you're in that crisis <#/>One of the items that was discovered say I think that a number of them whether you <-_talks><+_talk> about books you discovered that yo
u
 are buying expensive books <#/>So you sit down you say why can't we buy cheaper books <#/>With the same resources we can get more books <#/>You are using a hundred and fifty-eight million for rent <#/>You say why can't we devise another system so that we
 
can save and I'm sure what you are going to save from that rent money you can use it for other resources for other uh works in at the University <#/>So if it is a general criticism of rigidity in our minds or the system then we can <./>a all of us think a
b
out it uh <#/>Really I don't think you can because there are certain things we cannot interfere with you here <#/>And in any case the budget the framework comes from here <#/>You decide your priorities here in the context of the <-/>the little resources w
e
 have <#/>You are the ones who determine <#/>And I'm sure even the vice-chancellor before the budget comes <#/>I think it comes from every faculty <#/>And every faculty will determine its own priorities knowing that the resources are not enough <#/>Now wh
ere is the rigidity <#/>I <-/>I I'm not supposing that I'm trying to answer you <#/>You are provoking <#/>I'm trying to provoke you some more 
\par }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$E> <#/>uh I'm Dr Muraga from the History Department <#/>I think the concept Mr Prime Minister the concept of having closed the University to save I think is wrong <#/>We haven't saved for }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
 closing the University <#/>I think we should get away from this
\par <$C> <#/>No no no <#/>I didn't say that we closed the University in order to save }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>laughter}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 
that one consequence of <./>th closing the University was that you had some money and you wondered how to use that money and used it that way <#/>Now let me come to the point <#/>I think I don't know whether the vice-chancellor uh told you when I said if 
I come here I would like to have to <./>dis uh to discuss a few things with you <#/>The general impression we have and I think I'm gaining it here uh I don't know what that <#/>It's some sort of apathy at the University <#/>We don't know whether it is a c
o
nsequence of the closure of the University but the sort of uh literature that you have uh issued is worrying us <#/>Because whatever has happened when the University reopens you are the people who are going to return it to normality <#/>And I told the vic
e
-chancellor reading through <-/>through this you have a lot of concerns <#/>Now I thought I could come and discuss with you some of these concerns and that you'll be as frank as possible and discuss whatever worries you here <#/>This is your document isn'
t
 it <#/>Well it is a document of the General Assembly of UDASA <#/>You raise a number of concerns here <#/>As was willing and I told the vice-chancellor I was ready to spend three hours here so that we can discuss frankly because it worries us <#/>And I a
s
sume you discussed it in detail <#/>The President read this document <#/>He was worried <#/>He said I think we ought to have a fuller discussion with the members of the Academic Staff <#/>Clear out any misunderstandings any worries so that when the Univer
sity opens we put the crisis behind }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_us>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 and proceed <#/>As usual I'm the front man <#/>Sometimes it is easier that you }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 can talk with me rather than the President <#/>Now this document has made a good background very good background to the cri
sis <#/>Has examined in detail the issues and has set out how each of the actors dealt with the crisis the students the party the Government the University Administration including the Council and UDASA uh uh the mass media and right now we are working on
 whatever is necessary in order to open the University
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 <#/>How do we resolve or what uh assurances do you need <#/>Because there is a lot of concern which has been raised here <#/>This university is our university <#/>And if we have a problem we should 
all work together to resolve <#/>And at least I could <#/>What I had expected <./>i }{\fs24\lang2057 <#/>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
There are a lot of things here you which you expect the Government to do You haven't said how And I thought the immediate problem before us is to do whatever is necessa
ry so that we <./>re reopen the University as soon as possible and in an atmosphere which doesn't encourage a perpetual crisis What do you expect the Government to do so that we when we reopen the University the crisis is behind us
\par <$F> <#/>The Honourable Prime Minister and First Vice President 
\par <$?> Your name
\par <$F> <#/>My name My name is Songoyi from the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences Thanks very much for visiting us and I think this was a question and answer as we read in on the announcements And I th
ink I <-/>I would suggest to change it in one way or another that as I understood it from the talk uh of the honourable guest here is that he came here with very specific documents uh from us The government has read these documents and according to what o
u
r guest says they are worried and so uh it was reasonable and wise to come and discuss with us that is to learn more uh about these documents It's good Personally and I think my fellow members of the academic staff are not very much worried about these do
c
uments I was and I would expect perhaps the other side now to ask us what did you mean by this What did you mean by this Maybe you could keep the dialogue or discussion live because we have said what we had to say in these documents so perhaps the Honoura
b
le the Prime Minister and Vice President can now question us and my worry is that he may not get the response because the notice was very uh short you see and we were not told that he is coming to discuss these things How could we prepare answers So pleas
e
 I would ask then if we get the questions and we get time to sit together as members of UDASA and then we can provide a very comprehensive answer to solve and help create a condition that can make us work well when the University reopens Whatever that soo
n means Thank you very much 
\par <$C> <#/>This is not my first time here It is not my first time here I have been here before and if anything these sort of meetings have lasted for about two and a half three hours and we didn't run out of issues of uh discussio
n and it is always it was always like that I come here for a question and answer session and there were a lot of questions We couldn't exhaust them The attitude now and I would appeal to you the attitude now is revealing We have had a crisis It is not the
 
first time we have had a crisis at the University I think this is the third major crisis since the uh University was established in nineteen sixty-one The first crisis was in nineteen sixty-six The second crisis major crisis was in nineteen seventy-eight

nd the third one this year Now throughout well the <-/>the first uh crisis I was in a way part of it although it occurred after I had left the University in nineteen sixty-six But it had started building up before I left the University I left the Universi
t
y in March nineteen sixty-six It came in October but it had been building up since nineteen sixty-five over the issue of National Service I was in the Student Union It was a subject matter of the Student Union Congress at that time in August nineteen sixt
y
-five and it took a whole year and we know what happened After that it took the University a long time to recover Both the student population and the academic staff The same can be said about the crisis in nineteen seventy-eight I think the University beg
a
n to recover from the effect of the nineteen seventy-eight crisis in nineteen eighty-four Now we have had a crisis this year and throughout the numerous meetings that I had with some of you I said one responsibility that we have a common responsibility bo
t
h the government and the uh <-/>the University community is to make sure we don't repeat what happened in sixty-six and seventy-eight Let's take as a lesson what happened before and try to minimise the damage that has been caused by this crisis I said let
'
s work together and I think I have repeated this several times in the meetings and I think all the meetings that I met I held you were represented All of them were attended by the Vice Chancellor All of them except one The meeting I held with the Deans th
e
 Deans of all the <-_faculty><+_faculties> all of them were attended by representatives of UDASA and we were making these points After the crisis and what we agreed in those meetings that we are going to have two approaches in order to resolve this crisis
 One the University administration and the Ministry of Education to work out the logistics of reopening the University and what needs }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_to>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 be done before the University is opened and I think that is proceeding The second one was how do we deal with what l
ed to the crisis As far as the government was concerned we <-/>we heard the University Council had appointed a commission Do you call it a Commission 
\par <$?> Yes
\par <$C> <#/>A commission to look into it and make recommendations and the government said then we a
re going to depend on what the Council is going to recommend after they have seen the report of the commission and I was told that commission was Part of my timing of this <-/>this visit was that I did not want to come here before the report was discussed
 
and I was told it was going to be discussed on the twenty third So I said I don't want to go and say anything that would have a bearing on the work of the Commission I want the Commission to finish submit its report to the Council then after that I can go
 for a discussion because we will have put behind that The Council will have discussed and made recommendations then we will have we would be free to discuss frankly now

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <I> <$A> <#/>Well today we are discussing the International Village for Science and Technology here in Tanzania <#/>Maybe to begin with uh Dr Shayo can you tell us what this centre is all about
\par <$B> <#/>uh This centre uh actually it's not a centre it is a village It's }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  non-governm
ental uh non-profit-making international organisation uh whose objectives is to promote science and technology in Africa through the organisation and exploitation of uh indigenous scientific capacity <#/>The village will also develop young talents to the 
highest level possible
\par <$A> <#/>And are there any uh special reasons as to why this village <./>ha are there reasons as to why uh which necessitated the establishment of this particular village
\par <$B> <#/>uh There uh Actually there are several <-/>several rea
sons uh <#/>First the idea of creating the village arose out of uh desperate realisation that the traditional systems of education we inherited uh have not actually managed to uh to bring about uh uh the development of scientists and technologists in the 
r
egion <#/>Now we have also been motivated uh through our participation at the uh International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste Italy which was created in nineteen sixty-four precisely to assist uh scientists from developing countries uh to uh de
v
elop themselves and prevent them from running away from their countries <#/>Now we have the experience which uh African scientists participating in the ICTP sponsored activities on several occasions and deliberating on the plight of African scientists and
 
appreciated that the creation of centres of excellence such as the Village is the only answer to the problems facing the <./>de developing countries and African countries in particular <#/>In general therefore the global motivation behind the creation of 
t
he Village is the unquestionable conviction that the Village will <./>revov revolutionise the <-/>the harnessing of the enterprise of science and technology in Africa and this is indispensable if we are to achieve any measurable social-economic developmen
t <#/>Now the Village is designed to promote science and <-/>and technology at all levels
\par <$A> <#/>Dr Shayo has uh told us about the Village and why uh there was need to put up such a village here in Tanzania <#/>Maybe <name/> can you dwell on the objectives of the Village 
\par <$C> <#/>uh Briefly one can say that there are five objectives <#/>The first is to enable scientists and technologists to exploit their ingenuity fully by providing them with the means and the best environment for innovations and a place 
for <-/>for thinking uh <#/>Two to promote uh inter-African and international co-operation in science and technology mainly because science really knows no boundaries <#/>Thirdly and this is particularly true in our situation in Africa today to provide sp
e
cial facilities for the training and development of talented scholars uh to the highest level possible <#/><-_Fourthly><+_Fourth> uh there is since science is so interrelated it is necessary to promote interdisciplinary research and development activities
 
uh not only in an academic milieu but also in collaboration with industries <#/>Finally it is necessary to promote the teaching of science and technology at all levels uh and in particular so as to improve the quality of books laboratory equipment uh as w
ell as to organise promotional activities and very related to this would be to have uh seminars for <-/>for teachers and zonal students to resolve problems
\par <$A> <#/>Dr Mvungi location of such a village in Tanzania uh Prof Msangi location of uh such a village uh in Tanzania is also uh very crucial <#/>Where do you intend to put up the <-/>the Village 
\par <$D> <#/>uh The International Village for Science and Technology will eventually have its headquarters in Arusha <#/>But before the headquarters are built the I
nternational Village for Science and Technology will be temporarily based in Dar es Salaam <#/>At present uh the preparatory activities of the Village are based at the University of Dar es Salaam but there are also possibilities that when the new offices 
u
h the new office block of the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology which is currently under construction gets completed towards the end of this year some of the activities of the International Village for Science and Technology might be based in
 that building
\par <$A> <#/>Are there any specific reasons as to why you decided to uh choose Arusha as the location of the Village 
\par <$D> <#/>Oh yes uh <#/>The Provisional Council of the International Village for Science and Technology considered four possible 
locations for the headquarters of the International Village for Science and Technology on the basis of four well-defined criteria <#/>One criterion was the ease of access by international airlines that is to say uh the availability of uh of a good and mod
e
rn airport with international connections <#/>Secondly there was need <./>f uh for the Centre to be located in a place with a mild and favourable climate for academic work and a climate which is not corrosive to sensitive scientific equipment that is to s
a
y a climate which is characterised by moderate temperatures and humidity levels throughout the year uh <#/>Thirdly the place should be attractive and should have a <-/>a <-/>a an attractive countryside with tourist attraction so as to serve as an induceme
n
t for foreign scientists <#/>And <-_fourthly><+_fourth> there should be availability of a reasonable amount of infrastructure uh in the way of international standard hotel accommodation conference facilities and a <./>reason a reasonable amount of existin
g
 research facilities <#/>Now on the basis of those four criteria uh the four locations that were considered were Dodoma Morogoro Dar es Salaam and Arusha <#/>And on the basis of a point score Arusha obtained the highest score <#/>So it is intended that th
e International Village for Science and Technology shall be located or have its headquarters in Arusha
\par <$A> <#/>Thank you Prof Msangi <#/>Dr Mvungi can you uh <#/>What benefits do you foresee uh as to <#/>What benefits will Tanzania get by hosting the International Village of Science and Technology 
\par <$E> <#/>uh It is very many you know <#/>Many benefits can be enumerated uh <#/>First of all one could consider the possibility of all the scientists in country you know those who have the calibre to interact wit
hin the International Village <#/>They will have easy access to the Village and they will not be compelled to make formal arrangements for travel you know which normally takes a lot of time if you have to leave your own country to go to an international p
l
ace for such activities <#/>The second reason is that the spring-offs from the Village will spread much more easily to the scholars and to the industries in the country by promoting productivity and we also expect that through its international activities
 
the Village will promote scientific revolution uh not only in science but also in the area of technology in Africa in general but we expect that Tanzania will benefit more from this kind of revolution <#/>And the international character of the Village is 
e
xpected to guarantee high standards and therefore provide a model to our local institutions which can <./>imu emulate by seeing what is happening at the International Village so that is also another benefit <#/>And another benefit is that scholars visitin
g
 the Village will be motivated to <./>pr to do more to produce more serious work to become more productive because I think normally when you work with colleagues who have produced results you're also motivated to produce results and we expect the Village 
t
o have that kind of attraction to our scientists <#/>And on the other hand we also expect that Tanzania will become a centre of science and technology and it will be known as a centre of science and technology and that we consider to be an important advan
t
age by hosting this International Village uh <#/>It will also open the country to international scientific community and therefore not only <./>boo boost the tourist industry but also promote the outlook in the way we <./>b <-/>we should best harness the 
e
nterprise of science and technology for social-economic development <#/>And lastly I think that uh Tanzania will benefit by having uh <-_>by having<-/> other people support the Village through its uh <-/>through this <-/>this <./>ap <-/>through the activi
ties of the Village once they know what is happening in the Village we'll get more support from the international community but within the field of science and technology and possibly help the country to industrialise more
\par <$A> <#/>Thank you very much Dr Mvungi for underlining the advantages of the uh Village to Tanzania <#/>Now if I may come back to you again Professor Mascarenhas <#/>Are there any plans for self-reliance in the operational plans of the Village 
\par <$C> <#/>Yes I would like to emphasise that u
h the whole project has started by being self-reliant to the extent that the initiatives are coming from Tanzania itself <#/>Now in the future uh we will have to prevail upon this very good start which we made uh <#/>Let me say that in initial stages the 
V
illage will depend entirely on uh local uh as well as international donations uh <#/>However with the functions which you have already mentioned and those which are envisaged such a village cannot exist uh on its own especially in a poor developing countr
y
 like Tanzania in fact if its goal is not eventually self-reliant but it is an international village and therefore we are not only talking about Tanzania uh <#/>I think we would like to emphasise the self-reliance will also be with other African countries
 
<#/>With this uh realisation therefore the Village will adopt a policy which emphasises uh as we have already stated self-reliance right from the start <#/>Most institutions when they're young have to rely on sources outside for assistance also but I thin
k in this particular case the percentage of the budget of uh the Village uh will increase from year to year until in fact the total amount coming to self-reliance activities will be an appreciable part of the total budget of the Village
\par <$A> <#/>Dr Shayo Ma
ybe now we could uh go a little bit into the role of the Village in the promotion of education uh <#/>How will this particular Village <-/upbring> for instance primary education secondary education university education and <-/>and indeed research in Tanza
nia 
\par <$B> <#/>Well uh very generally the Village will promote primary secondary and university education uh by making its facilities available to scholars from these institutions uh <#/>It will promote research by offering hospitality to researchers <#/>Now
 to be more particular there will be an international uh primary school complex and an international secondary school complex at the Village specifically for talented scholars <#/>Now these schools will have the best available facilities or may let me say
 
that the <-/>the uh we shall try to have the best <./>a available facilities for the training and development of such talents <#/>Now special visits by selected groups of these uh to these complexes will promote excellence in descending institutions <#/>N
o
w the Village will also promote joint activities between primary schools and secondary schools on the one hand and between schools colleges and university teachers on the other hand in order to create required skills uh <#/>As an example uh one could uh y
o
u could envisage uh a joint activity uh in book-writing <#/>For example if you one is to produce a <-/>a book for secondary schools one could do uh use secondary school teachers and university teachers uh uh writing chapters jointly <#/>Now the Village wi
l
l accommodate international research centres for each of the science disciplines that is Biological Sciences Biotechnology Chemical Sciences <O/> Sciences Mathematical Sciences uh Physics uh Technology and also a centre for uh the design and fabrication o
f
 science teaching and research <-_equipments><+_equipment> <#/>Now scientists from all African countries and also from all over the world uh will be able to conduct research and interact in various academic uh <./>act activities which will be organised at
 
the Village <#/>Now the <-/>the of great importance is the Technology Centre which will form a link with industry <#/>It will have a variety of components for visiting innovative technologists who would like to maybe fabricate whatever uh gadgets they may
 
have designed <#/>Moreover talented scholars will attend their uh undergraduate and postgraduate studies in the centres in the research centres with assistance of senior scientists visiting the Village <#/>Now what we are saying here is that the Village w
i
ll have a will offer university education but not in the conventional sense uh of having a university campus and so on uh <#/>That is uh this <./>uni the undergraduates and postgraduates will join the respective uh research centres where uh scientists fro
m
 all over the world will be there to assist them uh <#/>Special organised visits by selected undergraduate and research groups as well as industrialists will promote excellence in descending institutions <#/>For example a person working in an innovative p
erson working in an industry could for example spend three months at the science village uh to complete uh work which could not have completed }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 in the place of work and after that go back to <-/>to <-/>to the industry
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Also during normal unive
rsity vacations some selected undergraduate students could visit the village to acquire extra knowledge by attending advanced lectures and problem session seminars and interact with scientists visiting the village Now a problem session seminar is a semina
r where only problems are discussed and the proceedings of such a seminar will be the compilation of real life problems and also other problems which researchers can go and research into 
\par <$?> Thank you
\par <$A> <#/>What type of problems do you intend to <-/>to discuss in the type of seminars you are talking about 
\par <$B> <#/>Well let me give an example of uh of one problem session seminar which we held in Arusha in nineteen uh in September nineteen eighty-nine This was a problem session where we discussed such pr
oblems as modelling the Aid epidemic and also the <-/>the erosion at the Dar es Salaam beaches and we simply discussed the problems and also another problem we discussed was the problem of flood control and now the country is facing uh flood hazards so we
 have a mathematical way of modelling these problems And what we are saying that in a seminar like that we discuss such problems and then they'll be floated to researchers all over the place
\par <$A> <#/>Thank you very much Maybe we should come back to you agai
n Professor Mascarenhas Running a project like the Science and Technology Village you need resources indeed you need money and as you know Tanzania is currently undergoing difficult economic situation Now what magnitude of financing does the Village need 
initially And how do you expect to raise such funds 
\par <$C> <#/>I think in answering questions of how much funds we need we should put them in context The estimated cost of constructing all the buildings in the village at current Tanzanian prices is roughly uh two billion shillings
\par <$A> <#/>Two billion
\par <$C> <#/>Yes that means there are nine zeros followed by a number or to put it into dollars uh it's ten million dollars Now this is about the price of a <-_>of a<-/> <O_>}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 two words}{\v\fs24\lang2057 <O/> ship and I think a large co
untry like Tanzania can afford to spend this Indeed we have spent similar amounts of money at our Marine <./>Re Research Centre in Zanzibar for example We are talking about roughly uh five million dollars spent on the on the boat itself The estimated recu
r
rent expenditure for the village during the first five years will be approximately two hundred million shillings per year or one million dollars Now we need to put these figures into comparison For example when related to other research institutions in th
e
 world uh these are very tiny figures For example a centre at Trieste which deals mainly with Physics and Mathematics has in fact a recurrent expenditure of over sixteen million dollars So the figures which I have mentioned while they may seem large are i
n
 fact quite modest Now how do we expect to raise these funds What is the climate for it I think the climate is very reasonable Since the Village initiative has received the very crucial political support as well as uh enthusiasm of the scientific communit
y
 to create the village uh it has been decided to in fact raise about six hundred Tanzanian shillings uh locally through voluntary donations uh so far Now I'd like to emphasise that the donations so far are voluntary Uh At a later stage uh we will try to u
h
 solicit international support The crucial thing happening here is voluntary and the fact that right from the start we are being self reliant The first large donation of over a million shillings was made uh by the patron Mwalimu Julius Nyerere on the eigh
t
eenth of October nineteen eighty-nine and this was followed by another donation of five million shillings by CCM seven uh on the seventh of November nineteen eighty-nine Requests also have been made for donations to the Science uh Village uh from all priv
a
te as well as parastatal organisations government ministries uh private and public institutions as well as individuals Therefore to date uh nearly ten million shillings uh has been collected uh and although this may seem small this is the beginning the se
ed money and we hope that substantial donations will now follow
\par <$A> <#/>Well there are plans to run the Village this scientific Village as a non governmental organisation NGO Dr Mvungi why have you preferred an international NGO as compared to a national institution
\par <$E> <#/>Well whereas an international NGO can fulfil all the functions of a government organisation or local institution there are very important functions which an international NGO can fulfil but which cannot be fulfilled by other modalities 
The Village has been conceived from a consideration of serious problems facing the African continent which have their root in the neglect of science and technology The economics of scale the need to pool limited resources and other considerations pointed 
t
o the international modality We thought this was a better way of handling it An international NGO stands a better chance of attracting the interest and support of both governmental and non-governmental organisations Another reason for an international NGO
 
is that a scientific NGO such <-/>such as the International Village for Science and Technology requires the inherent independence and minimal bureaucracy for maximum effectiveness We have been guided by the experience of other NGOs It is precisely due to 
t
he characteristics of being an NGO that the ICPTP has been so successful despite the fact that the Italian government is providing over seventy five percent of the recurrent budget and a hundred percent of the capital expenditure of the International uh I
nstitute for Theoretical Sciences for Theoretical Physics in Italy So we feel this has been the reason really behind our <./>pref preference of an international NGO than any other modality }{\fs24\lang2057 </X></I>}{\v\fs24\lang2057

\par }{\fs24 <I> <$A> <#/>The important questions that were addressed in the paper are basically three which I think will be the focus of our discussion this afternoo
n <#/>The first question is whether women are able to participate in the productive processes and the welfare benefits in the course of economic development <#/>The second question is whether women are primary victims of exploitation <#/>And the third is 
what factors influence alternative <./>out outcomes with regard to women\rquote 
s participation <#/>The fourth question which we will be addressing ourselves to will be to what extent are women aware of technical and financial support from donor agencies as well a
s loan schemes operated by different <-/>ba banks and other organizations in the country <#/>Now maybe we should start with the first question which is to what extent can women participate in the productive processes and the welfare benefits in the course
 of economic development uh Rose
\par <$B> <#/>Uh thank you the question is not whether women can participate <#/>I think it is a well-known fact that women do participate <#/>Statistics show that uh production in this country whether it\rquote s food crop or whatever it\rquote 
s the women who participate <#/>Over seventy-five per cent of the food production is being carried out by women in this country <#/>What is lacking here is that women have not been enabled to participate fully in development <#/>There are constraints th
at make <./>wo <-/>make women's contribution uh hampered <#/>That is uh work heavy load }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>idiom}{\fs24 
 that they have then lack of technologies that will reduce the work load and uh the lack of access to facilities that are being provided by the nation or the d
onors or whoever is providing the facilities <#/>And the other important thing is lack of effective participation in decision-making in the decision-making processes because I want to distinguish here between being represented and participating in decisio
n-making
\par <$A> <#/>Any more comments
\par <$C> <#/>Well I think Rose is quite correct in the answer she gave for }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24  your question <#/>Women are really participating and very much in agriculture <#/>But uh the point she raised about their participation in de
cision-making I think it is the cornerstone of the problem we are having }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  right now that uh in spite of the fact that women do participate but }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 they could do better if they would first be in the decision-making bodies right from the villages and up <#/>Therefore maybe we should not uh dwell in this }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24 
 since the policies of this country favour the development of women maybe now in the execution of it we should see to it that women are involved in the decision-making to affairs }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\b\fs24  }{\fs24 
which can make them more able to participate in their development
\par <$A> <#/><ea/>Mama Busongo do you have any comments about this
\par <$D> <#/>Well there <-_are><+_is> a lot to be desired when you are talking about women in this country <#/>Your <-/>your 
question was are women able to participate in the production productive processes and the welfare benefits in the course of economic development <#/>Participation of the woman as uh Rose has said you can\rquote t deny or there\rquote 
s no limit where a woman is not participating in development of this country <#/>But there are a lot of things which make this woman not participate }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 fully in her capacity <#/>Uh I think one of the <-_factor><+_factors> which is very important for a woman is the health service which a woman is getting in our dispensaries which we are having }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 in our country <#/>Rose has said that in the <./>proc uh in the production we've got this seventy-five per cent of all the women participating in the economic development <#/>But whe
n you go to the records health reports you find that twenty per cent of these women most of the time are pregnant <#/>Another twenty per cent of these women are having children under five years <#/>Now we all know how effective is a woman }{\b\v\fs24 
<&/>grammar}{\fs24  in production when she is pregnant <#/>And we all know how busy is a <-/>a woman }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  when <-_it's><+_she\rquote s> having }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 a child under five years <#/>And when we go to our dispensaries we find that we have got I mean the medicines drugs which we\rquote re having }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  are not sufficient enough to make this woman be treated }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}
{\fs24  when she is in need of treatment or when she brings her child to the dispensary <#/>You find that there is not enough medicine or treatment for this child <#/>As a res
ult this woman is restless is busy with childcare is busy with her health as a pregnant woman <#/>So when you add these twenty per cent of pregnant women and another twenty per cent of <-/>of uh <-_mother><+_mothers> having }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 a child under five year five years you find that <./>twent forty per cent uh out of seventy-five per cent }{\b\v\fs24 <+_of>}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 these women are in health problem }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>idiom}{\fs24 
 <#/>So if we want to <-/>to make these women to participate }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  fully in our production economic development it\rquote s very important for our plans to make sure that }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 health department is very well equipped we have got these medicines in our dispensaries and in our hospitals so that we enable this woman to participate fully in economic development <#/>This is my opinion
\par <$A> <#/>I thank you <#/>One of the <-/>the issues as we discuss the role of the woman in the economic development is normally uh based on the woman as a health provider the woman as a food provider and the woman as the maker of the home in gen
eral <#/>And some of the issues that are normally discussed in these particular lines of arguments }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\b\fs24  }{\fs24 
do centre particularly on key issues that are important in maintaining the family that are important in the general up-keep of the family <#/>Uh in 
the area of health obviously it is important as Honourable Busonga uh said that the health of the woman <-_>of the<-/> of women in general is an important issue it\rquote 
s an important factor in the general up-keep of these very <-_>these very<-/> individuals <#/>Uh what do you think should then be done in improving facilities in the health sector Mary Ruila 
\par <$C> <#/>First of all maybe I should start by saying uh that presently the government has done a lot to that since uh besides having the health services rig
ht there in the <-_>in the<-/> <-_>in the<-/> towns or in the city it has been possible to <-/>to have even dispensaries or health services in the villages <#/>If I give an example of my district here nearly all the fourteen villages have got dispensaries
 
<#/>And they have they are running their MCH clinics for <-/>for <-/>for the mothers <#/>Now maybe to build up to that what I think could be done in order to improve the health services for the women is to carry out health education classes I think this i
s very fundamental <#/>I really think it is still <-_>it is still<-/> lacking <#/>I know it is done in the hospitals <#/>I mean when you go there before <-/>before you are attended then there will be a class going but I don\rquote 
t think it is enough <#/>One that person is sick therefore when one gets there maybe with a baby and if she\rquote s sick I don't think it is the proper time <#/>I don\rquote 
t think she can grasp the matter from there <#/>But there should be deliberate classes or training <./>he <./>heal health traini
ng programmes for <-/>for <-/>for <-/>for the women in order to know some basic health issues <#/>And I think this would alleviate this problem of uh diseases and health care for this home maker
\par <$A> <#/>Any comments Mrs Rugembe
\par <$B> <#/>Uh I agree with <ea/>Mama Ruila that prevention is better than cure <#/>We all are aware that these there aren\rquote 
t enough sufficient funds to equip the hospitals with the required medicine so the approach of prevention should be stressed and then in that way you reduce I gues
s the number of diseases or you reduce the chances of people getting sick <#/>And uh there will only be need to go to the hospital when you know health care prevention care hasn\rquote 
t succeeded instead of besides going to the <-_>to the<-/> curative centres <#
/>And uh when you have a healthy home when you have a healthy mother I believe you are definitely going to have a healthy home because a healthy mother will be able to participate fully in other activities that will benefit the family <#/>Maybe that I lea
ve to your second observation I think it was are women aware of 
\par <$A> <#/>Yeah that\rquote s right <#/>The extent to which women are aware of technical and financial support uh available in the country uh <#/>Apart from health the other key sector which was addres
sed was really the agricultural sector <#/>Now the issue here is really the need to expand women\rquote 
s access to agricultural research and extension services perhaps by training key females who should be able to take up key positions in that particular area and in order to improve uh the women\rquote 
s participation in that particular sector <#/>Uh how do you think this should actually be done uh <name/> Busongo
\par <$D> <#/>Well if we want to improve in agriculture there is a <-/>a lot to be desired on }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24  how a woman should participate fully in knowing what to do so that she can improve the production of
\par <$A> <#/>food
\par <$D> <#/>Well it\rquote s food it\rquote s uh anything which she is growing <-_>she\rquote s growing<-/> in her in her farm should be done properly according to the what t
he agriculture experts are trying to explain to us <#/>But what I think is lacking is how we are trying to make these ladies participate fully when we want to make them reach }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24 
 the knowledge of how to use their talents and knowledge of agriculture
 so that when he farms when she farms she <-_get><+_gets> more production per acre uh before comparing to what she was doing before <#/>Now we need a lot of seminars on how to use uh fertilisers how to plant using uh spacing according to the knowledge of 
t
hese agricultural people <#/>So what I think we need a lot of seminars in our demonstration farms <#/>There is a <-_>there is a<-/> need of having small farms projects <-_to><+_in> the village so that these ladies can see how much they can grow they can g
et from a little space <#/>This is what I think this could be done
\par <$A> <#/>All right yeah to what extent do you think demonstration farms would be important uh <name/> Rugembe
\par <$B> <#/>Uh in the old days I used to hear and see demonstration farms but my approach would be using the farmers\rquote  farms <#/>And the farmers\rquote 
 farms should <./>be become the demonstration farms <#/>So in order to do this first you need to increase the intake of female and of course male agricultural extension officers in schools so tha
t you have more that can reach the <-/>the farmers and farmers meaning men and women <#/>And then when you have these extension officers you could use the extension officers to go to make farm visits in their farms so that you know the demonstrations are 
done in their own farms <#/>When this is not possible then it's to use the existing facilities }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 like the rural training centres the <O/> development colleges and uh all the other institutions that we have <#/>Then you can call the farmers and I insist farmers meaning women because they\rquote 
re the ones who are farming to these <-_>to these<-/> institutions where uh other facilities are available and teach them how to use uh whether it is fertilisers or irrigation pumps or whatever you have <#/>That is 
the only way that you can <-_>you can<-/> increase the knowledge of the women farmers and men farmers so that they can be more productive in the farms <#/>This business of calling seminars for male farmers will not take us very far because when they go ba
ck these guys don\rquote t go back to the farms and farm <#/>They <-/>they explain to the women oh I went to that seminar and I was taught this and this <#/>So it is important that the services and the education should reach the one who is farming
\par <$A> <#/>So you think training females would actually be much more important than the traditional methods where males have been <./>tr trained and they go back to the villages as uh <-/>as uh field assistants and so on
\par <$B> <#/>Male <-/>male training the females is very important and training the female farmers themselves because it is easier I believe for a female extension officer to communicate with a female farmer
\par <$A> <#/><name/> Rulia
\par <$C> <#/>I would only like uh to assure this audience }{\b\v\fs24 <+_of>}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 one thing <#/>The question of training women and not in the <O/> governmental colleges but right in the farms We have <-_>we\rquote 
ve tried<-/> this in Kibaha <X_> }{\v\fs24 We tried to conduct short courses for female farmers right in the villages right in the farms by using the extension wor
kers who are in their wards It was very very successful I mean I have no quarrel about using the <O/> governmental colleges but uh once you call these female farmers there as we've heard maybe one has a child Sometimes it\rquote 
s the husband who says how many weeks two weeks away from this home To him it is just impossible Therefore he won\rquote t let the woman go And if she won\rquote t go there that means she can\rquote t get that knowledge and there won\rquote 
t be any impact There won\rquote t be any changes in the way she is farming Therefor
e I think the <-/>the best solution would be to train them right in their villages right in their <ea/>shambas However I know I think it was in nineteen eighty-five if not eighty-six when the ministry of agriculture said that uh all the <ea/>Bwana}{
\b\v\fs24  <}{\v\fs24 ea}{\b\v\fs24 />}{\v\fs24 sha
mbas in the districts in the wards they should have demonstration farms They should have demonstration farms so that that could be a ground training ground for the farmers in the <-_>in the<-/> villages To implement that in some places where I was working
 we had a two-fold kind of approach one is that of the <ea/>Bwana <ea/>shamba having <-/>having the plot and the other one was the village <ea/>shamba to be the demonstration farm And it worked pretty well I\rquote 
m really insisting on having on having this extension work done right in the farms because it is where people can see and they can start straight away to implement it
\par <$A> <#/>Thank you uh Do you have any further comments <name}{\b\v\fs24 />}{\v\fs24  Busongo
\par <$D> <#/>On agriculture
\par <$A> <#/>On agriculture really
\par <$D> <#/>Well when you see the DANIDA\rquote s plan for action on agriculture uh they've got so many points where they focus on women in small scale farming projects and uh other things For all this what we are trying to do we shouldn\rquote 
t forget men If we <./>exc exclude this completely we are going to be in danger It\rquote s much better for the men also to know what we want to what <-/>what do we want for these women }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24 
 We participate where we have <-_>we have<-/> to integrate with men so that we get the support of the men for this Otherwise we\rquote ll find that the men will say oh it\rquote s your work go and cultivate there }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>laughter}{\v\fs24 
 I think this should be uh we want to <-/>to focus on women so because we know that these women are the ones who are doing the uh job physical job but 
if we exclude completely these men we are going to be in trouble So I think we should be careful on focusing all these things This is what I would add
\par <$A> <#/>Yeah as you will probably have noted the DANIDA\rquote s plan of action considers four main sectors uh for support uh in relation to... }{\fs24 </X>

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <I> <$A> <#/>Who would like to take the first plunge may be to give us the definition of culture }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Who\rquote d like to define culture }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Okay uh Emilian 
\par <$B> <#/>Okay thank you uh }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 culture is a <-_>is a<-/> wide term and it has been defined in uh very many ways and uh we can say that culture means the totality of life of a particular society }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
Culture is a totality of life of a particular society including political social and economic affairs of that particular society }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
Cultural things can <-/>can be exemplified by ways of dressing ways of cooking ways of handling marriage affairs etcetera etcetera
\par <$A> <#/>Thank you very much }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Does anybody want to add in }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  some more Uh Omari 
\par <$C> <#/>Well I think uh in general we can say it's a }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
Culture is the traditional norms and beliefs of a certain society which uh includes the as my colleague here has said dressing the people behave the way the people behave in that society
\par <$A> <#/>Okay and uh gender }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Cuthbert you want to try this 
\par <$D> <#/>Well first of all gender is not the same as sex because we have two things gender and sex }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 So gender is <-_cultural><+_culturally> defined which <-_differentiate><+_differentiates> between females and male thei
r activities and the things of that nature but sex is <-_biological><+_biologically> uh recognizable }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 So when we talk about gender we have to put more emphasis on culture
\par <$A> <#/>Okay would we be right in saying that uh gender is the relationship between males and females perhaps Datus 
\par <SE> }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 To some extent you might be right to say so }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 But when we talk of gender the insistence is on culturally constructed differences between males and females }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
That's where the insistence comes in
\par <$A> <#/>Okay }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 So the next thing that we are supposed to define here in our context is change }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 What do we mean by change here Cuthbert 
\par <$D> <#/>Change in a simple form we can say is just uh transformation }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 That means transform to transform from one stage to another or from a certain situation to another }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 That is change
\par <$A> <#/>Okay Omari You want to add on }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  
\par <$C> <#/>Well uh well I think uh we can say change is uh moving from one position to <-_a><+_the> next or from a certain kind of uh way of uh living to another simply we can say even moving from traditional to maybe modern status
\par <$A> <#/>Okay maybe from backwardness to profuse
\par <$C> <#/>Yes
\par <$A> <#/>and things like that }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 I see uh Datus is raising a hand }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 What do you want to say 
\par <$E> <#/>Yes In fact when we are talking about the <-/>the definition of change in fact it is a broad term }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
If we <-/>if <-_>if we<-/> talk of changing from backward to forward of course that's part of change but in fact we may look}{\b\fs24\lang2057  }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_at>}{\v\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24\lang2057 the word change even in
 normal <-_>in normal<-/> terms }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Sometimes a person may move from one place to another }{\fs24 t}{\fs24\lang2057 hat's change may change }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 A person may change a way of life }{\fs24 <#/>}{
\fs24\lang2057 That's change already }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Now if we relate the question of change in the whole process of culture g
ender and related with change we are I think we are much referring to change from one way of living to another way in the sense that the previous the previous level was to some extent at the lower <-/>lower level of living now to we are moving to the bett
er way of living }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 That's why we are referring to change in relation to culture gender and change itself
\par <$A> <#/>Okay I think this far we have uh managed to give a <-/perspection> or perspective to our listeners as to what uh we perceive to be uh culture gender and change }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Now we are on we are moving on with our discussion }{
\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Who would like to take the first plunge whether we should look at these aspects differently or we should uh address these aspects you know in totality }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 When we are addressing 
culture gender and change should we identify or discuss these in separation or should we take them as an entity one entity Uh Omari 
\par <$C> <#/>Well I think uh we will discuss this in its totality with the aim especially of }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Our aim is to discuss what at 
least from a male's perspective what could be done to enhance uh the women's position uh in relation to uh what men can do men and women together and women as well }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 So this will take the issue uh discussion as a totality
\par <$A> <#/>Okay }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 So before we even address ourselves to what perhaps should be done maybe it would be better to look at the present situation }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
How is the situation of culture gender and change in present day uh Tanzania Cuthbert 
\par <$D> <#/>I think the present situation as far as cultu
re gender and change is concerned we can say that women are very much concerned uh at that time women are trying to emancipate themselves because for a long time it has been said that women are suppressed uh and this is due to the cultural situation }{
\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 So
 all in all in the present situation we can say that woman uh women are still uh suppressed and now they have to find some ways of change and these changes must go hand in hand with men so both genders must participate together in order to create changes 
and uh these changes must start from the grassroot or we can say from the family level up to the national level }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 That is all I can say
\par <$A> <#/>Okay thank you Cuthbert }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 I liked the way you put it but uh I would like <-_>I would like<-/> you to be more personal because you are saying it is said women are oppressed }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 What do you say }{
\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 What do you say as a male 
\par <$D> <#/>Okay as a male and as far as my culture is concerned I can also say that women to some extent are oppressed since they are denied of their right
\par <$A> <#/>Okay thank you very much Datus
\par <$E> <#/>Yes in fact maybe responding to the first part of your question culture gender and change whether to treat them in a holistic manner or to differentiate them my comment is that we cannot differentiate the three because they are intertwined }{
\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Now with reference to Tanzania we have seen that the culture is the way of living and gender is embedded within culture }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 That's why we cannot talk of gender uh in a <-_>in a<-/> universal way }{\fs24 
<#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Now whe
n we are looking at this country of ours Tanzania we look at our country it has its own culture though again this is debatable whether we have got our own culture or what but uh I think that's not uh part of uh the <-_>of the<-/> debate now }{\fs24 <#/>}{
\fs24\lang2057 Now gender of our country is that in fact the difference between men and females or uh let's say females and males is there and it is both I mean it is actually socially constructed }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
Now at this time women are not inherently treated as they are supposed to be and 
in fact the difference comes in when we look at uh <-_>when we look at<-/> the way culture treats women and the way this culture treats men because if you look at <-/>at the whole process of gender it is socially constructed }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
Now at this particular moment we are looking for change and change is inevitable at this particular time }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
But again if <-/>if before we look at change I think the most emphasis the most <./>import important point to insist on is change from where to where }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Where are we now and why are we looking for change }{\fs24 <#/>}{
\fs24\lang2057 I think that's where we must put the more emphasis
\par <$A> <#/>Okay thank you very much }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 From you I got two points that uh uh the whole question of women's oppression and suppression is socially constructed and it is embedded in culture }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
Okay Emilian let\rquote s hear from you }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 You've been quiet for quite some time
\par <$B> <#/>Yes I'm also of the opinion that these three things culture gender and change should be discussed uh <-/>discussed together because they depend on one a
nother because gender as the relationship between men and the women depends on the culture of a particular society }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
That's why we <-/>we <-/>we can see that uh gender relations are different perhaps in the African traditions compared to <-/>to Western or European American traditions }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
That's why I say that culture gender and change should be looked upon together and not in single entities }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Of course according to me at the particular moment uh our culture <-_>our culture<-/> as Tanzanians <-_>our cul
ture as<-/> uh yes <-_>our culture as Tanzanians<-/> has been brought up by history uh to the extent that women <-/>women are enjoying an inferior position compared to men whether you <-/>you look at uh <-_>you look<-/> in several sectors of the economy o
r
 aspects of life that women uh uh occupy an inferior position compared to men and uh at this particular juncture when our country is undergoing social political and economic transformations uh when we are about to undergo change it is appropriate now to a
d
dress ourselves to <-/>to <-/>to realizing and addressing uh those patches where gender imbalances occur that's gender imbalances <-_occurs><+_occur> because in <-/>in when a society changes <-_>when a society changes<-/> a change should involve all parts
 of this society because a change should be total and not partial because partial change would lead the society into an <./>un unpredicted situation which can be bad or harmful to that particular society
\par <$A> <#/>So now as we enter into multiparty politics 
how do you view you know the position of women you know looking at culture historically and at present time looking also at uh the gender imbalances that uh Emilian just talked about and also uh looked at from the point of view that uh for a long time wom
en were not there when uh politics were being discussed Omari 
\par <$C> <#/>Uh thank you }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Well in this uh multi-partyism era we could say that uh up to this moment the women are many of these parties are not really well explicit of <-_women><+_women's> position but uh on my view }{
\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057  is that I think uh at least there should be these parties should at least <./>integr integrate the women's position in their whole system of leadership }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
What I mean here is that in the past even the CCM now I think should 
think of a way of uh not keeping women as a women's wing which is the trunk there we <-/>we can't really define because if this is a political party then all the people should be the whole trunk and no wings I think }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
So what I see now is that also these new parties are taking almost the same stance uh having women's wing uh }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 I don't know which is the trunk but I think the whole party all members are the trunk of the party }{\fs24 <#/>}{
\fs24\lang2057 So my feeling is that uh women's position may be put into a much better situation if uh they are not taken as a separate entity but uh people who uh have the right to be there in the centre and they can contest for any position available

\par <$A> <#/>Okay considering the many uh disadvantages that women have in society due to cultural
 norms due to gender imbalances and due to the change that has actually been imposed on us it is not the kind of change that we wanted in the first place how do you see women being integrated into this change }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
Who wants to Okay Datus 
\par <$E> <#/>Yes maybe to respond in a very viable way let's go back a bit to history }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
There is the question of political culture in the whole process of democracy or uh of course we talk on this as democracy and part of multi-partyism }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Now there is a political culture of
 this country which existed even before independence and now it is repeating itself in the multi-party politics or multi-party era now }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
If you visit our history in the pre-independence period when this country was fighting for its independence women were involved though not in a way that everyone of us could have reasonably now <./>state stated openly that they were involved }{\fs24 <#/>}
{\fs24\lang2057 The political culture I am referring to is that of using women to mobilize party membership and again using few women and placi
ng them in the high profile or in the high political profile only to carry the party organs and make them be and then make them believe and in fact to confuse those who are <-_>who are<-/> below the profile that women are incorporated in the whole process
 of <-/>of politics }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
We saw before independence we have the <./>hist story of Titi and the other one who was the first <-_>the first<-/> uh <-_>the first<-/> CCM the first <-_>the first<-/> TANU General Secretary of <-/>of the women <-/>women wing UWT <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
All these were the signs that women were involved but only few But women were <./>major I mean they comprise the majority but only few were involved Now when come to the < />poli uh to the multi-party politics of this decade now we find that the culture 
and the political culture to be specific is repeating itself Only few women are involved to carry the party organs Now that in fact creates more worries As it happened in the past that after achieving independence women were told and in fact were forced t
o
 retreat to their back places in the kitchen and <-/>and such places of the sort Now the same story and same uh the same error may happen in this process of multi-party politics if we are not careful on the way women are involved and are integrated in the
 multi-party politics
\par <$A> <#/>Thank you very much uh Datus Anybody else want to yuh uh Emilian 
\par <$B> <#/>Yes uh I wanted just to insist that there is every necessity of incorporating women in politics under this situation or under this era of multi-party p
olitics because uh population-wise women <./>con <./>cons consist or uh women form about fifty-one percent of Tanzania politics uh Tanzanian population And of course uh discriminating women out of <-/>of politics is like obscuring very many people towards
 making decisions related to development Therefore <?/>shortly I can say that there is every necessity of incorporating women in <-/>in <-/>in multiparty politics not as wings but as independent participants yes
\par <$A> <#/>Thank you Now as male participants o
f this uh discussion programme why do you think for such a long time you know since even after independence only a few women and I might even add and say only a token of women have participated in politics What are some of the reasons Of course we've cite
d
 culture We have cited the fact that the majority were used in the pre-independence era for mobilization processes but we did not want them to you know remain as such as mobilizers we want them to be actors So why has it taken so long for women to partici
pate in politics as equal members of society uh Cuthbert
\par <$D> <#/>Uh thank you The first thing is about education because it goes without saying that women for a long time were denied of their right }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\v\fs24\lang2057  of being educated}{\b\v\fs24\lang2057  <&/>grammar}{
\v\fs24\lang2057  so if you pass throughout our country you can find that most of the people who were educated by then or up to this very moment are men So this caused uh the women to feel inferior to participate }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{
\v\fs24\lang2057  in political activities since they had uh or they have a poor educat
ion in comparison with uh men So on my side I can say that uh women are backward as far as political issues are concerned first of all because they uh <-/>they had for a long time received poor education in comparison with men and this poor education like
 I said it's due to the culture also If we go back to our culture because most of our culture denies the right of women to go to school
\par <$A> <#/>Thank you Cuthbert I buy your argument for education to be partly to blame you know as a source of women not bei
ng incorporated in uh politics as main actors but again I would like to come back to you and say for how long can we blame history because today we have so many women who are very well educated Why do we continue seeing these gaps women missing from the p
olitical arena Uh Emilian
\par <$B> <#/>Okay thank you uh According to my view women uh have occupied an inferior position as far as politics is concerned because of <-/>of the way they have been socialised by our societies or generally I can say that it <-/>it 
is because of the socialising agencies which have brought up the <-/>the women as <-/>as <-/>as people in our society That's why you find that <./>the <./>the they occupy the inferior position and by socialising agencies I mean those institutions which sh
a
pe one's personality those institutions which shape one's uh personality and there are very many socialising agencies exemplified by the family the school the media the religion traditional customs and also social interaction processes because you find ev
e
n in the family a child a <-/>a <-/>a daughter let's say is <-/>is <-/>is brought up to believe that she can't be compared with her fellow brothers Therefore she adapts or she starts thinking that she is <-_>she is<-/> always to take the inferior position
 Likewise when we come to schools and in schools we find that it is regarded for granted or just taken without uh just taken for granted that uh male students are more brighter than }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 female students Therefore even if a particular lady or daughter is <-/>is <-/>is <-/>is intelligent now she accepts inferiority and <-/>and her ability deteriorates Likewise even in religion Religion also treats women differently as }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 
<&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057  how men are <-/>are treated You find that even in churches or in mosques o
r where whatever place you find that women are not treated the same men are treated Men superiority can also be seen in religion And when you come to traditional customs our traditional customs also give women an inferior position You find that some of th
e
 women of course even fear to join politics because perhaps they can speak contrary to their <-_>to their<-/> men who are perhaps their husbands therefore they feel ashamed and also in the generally social interaction <-_>social interaction<-/> process yo
u find that women have come to <-/>to regard themselves as secondary <-_being><+_beings> when compared to men Generally all these socialising agencies account for women not wishing to participate in politics
\par <$A> <#/>Thank you very much uh Emilian uh Does anybody else want to add something uh Datus 
\par <$E> <#/>Yes in fact I think the whole issue is about <./>access accessibility to state position I think that's where we're referring I mean we are looking for the problem In fact what I see we should not keep to my view }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{
\v\fs24\lang2057 
 I think we should not keep on blaming the question of education that it has been crippling women's position to get accessibility to political positions Maybe our centre of criticism must be centred around the politics of patrilineage that
 been that has been exercised within this country I've previously said that ever since independence the politics of patrilineage has been influencing every aspect every ministry every institution and every aspect of whether political economic or whatever 
T
hat's where the problem comes in the politics of patrilineage is looked upon Let's take an example uh We have women very reputable and respectable are placed in the Ministry of Women Affairs To some extent we can say that this is part of uh integration of
 
women <-/>women in this country in political <-_>in political<-/> and economical accessibility but again let's look at this Ministry Ministry of <./>Wom Women Affairs What influence one what power does it have upon other ministries on the question of <-_w
o
men><+_women's> discrimination and<-_women><+_women's> oppression It's a question of patrilineage We can simply say they are okay they are involved but in fact they are patronized by patriarchal <-_>by patriarchal<-/> system which is dominating this count
ry That's my <-/>my view on that
\par <$A> <#/>Okay thank you very much Now this far we have realized that actually women are underdogs in almost all spheres of their lives Now what's to be done What can we do so that they are uh active participants
\par <$F> <#/>Wel
l that's a very loaded question Edda which will need another half hour programme of this kind However we are constrained with time and there we come to the end of this week's programme of Meeting of the Minds and the issue for discussion today was culture

inable management of the environment <#/>Okay when we talk of environmental management we are talking of preserving the environment from destruction preserving the resources from depletion and from pollution of the same resources for example distinction o
f
 endangered flora and fauna <#/>When we talk of flora and fauna we mean plants and animals <#/>There are several species of animals <#/>For example we have the black rhino which is about to be depleted in our country <#/>So trying to preserve the black rh
i
no is one of the issues in environmental management <#/>Likewise maintaining the air quality <#/>Maintaining the air from pollution <#/><./>We When we have clean air that's when we talk of environmental management of our air and also when we have clean wa
t
er unpolluted water <#/>In certain cases we talk of Zigi river Karanga river <./>we the rivers which are polluted by wastes from industry <#/>So in fact environmental management essentially means preserving our resources namely land water and air from des
truction and at the same time using the resources effectively 
\par <$B> <#/>Thank you Mrs Maembe for your contribution and thank you for giving us the right word that is not environmental conservation but it's not but it's environmental management that is becau
se we are not experts at all <#/>So now we know that uh environmental management is preserving the environment from destruction depletion etcetera <#/>uh Mr Tenende do you have anything to say on what really do we mean when we talk about environmental con
servation or I mean environmental management
\par <$C> <#/>Well I think I agree with uh Mrs Maembe because when we manage I mean using the land in a manner which would ensure that uh the resources are there uh in the future to enable sustainable life to continue
\par <$B> <#/>uh <?/>Erin Jiko do you have anything to add apart from 
\par <$D> <#/>Yes <#/>Having agreed having agreeing with <-_having agreed>-/> with them I <./>s still have wish to add that environmental conservation particularly in agriculture the way I see i
t is conservation of natural resources as they have said but I would like to include the conservation of human resources in this case particularly the woman herself <#/>It is not enough to just talk about <./>n uh natural resources like land and water the
n we should talk about the human resource in that case then we would touch the issues concerning her health and energy depletion when performing her tasks 
\par <$B> <#/>Now we understand uh uh when we talk uh about environmental conservation or environmental ma
nagement we mean preserving natural resources and human resources <#/>Now how do you do we view the state of environmental problems in our country Mr Tenyende
\par <$C> <#/>Well of course there are a lot of examples showing the destruction of environment uh <#/
>For example there are statistics which show that uh uh the forest land which was there in nineteen twenty has been destroyed to the extent that only forty per cent remains and uh we are told that uh deforestation is continuing at a rate of zero point fiv
e <./>perc per cent per year and this is something to be concerned <-_with><+_about> because the impact is quite great both on land and climate and therefore there are <-_>there are<-/> examples of destruction of our environment in this country
\par <$B> <#/>Mrs Maembe
\par <$A> <#/>The <-/>the state of environmental problems in this country range from environmental degradation and when we talk on of environmental degradation we <-_real><+_really> mean soil erosion deforestation depletion of woodlands or pollution of 
our land for example those gold miners in <name/> <#/>These people are using mercury in the extraction of gold <#/>At the same time that this mercury is finding its way <-_in><+_into> the streams and polluting the waters which are used for domestic use an
d
 other <.>por purposes <#/>Likewise we have depletion of our <ea/><?/>nyumbo lands <#/>Of course in Tanzania we know that we have very big parts covered by <ea/><?/>nyumbo woodlands and these parts are <-_real><+_really> being <./>ut utilised for making c
harcoal for cutting poles to build the houses and so on <#/>As a result a lot of areas have been depleted of their trees <#/>Likewise we have bush fires which are so rampant in our country especially during this dry season <#/>So these are just some of }{
\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24  environmental problems in our country <#/>Just to to add to that we have also these farmers who are clearing a lot of woodlands for agriculture and in fact we sometimes put a pointing finger to agricultural people }{
\b\v\fs24 <&/>idiom}{\fs24  that these are the culpr
its of our environmental destruction because we think they go with one package of agriculture rather than sustainable agriculture for conserving our whatever resources are there <#/>Rather than cutting trees we think it would have been advisable for them 
to try to talk of agro-forestry rather than agriculture alone
\par <$B> <#/>We have heard from Mrs Maembe that the state of environmental problems in our country is mainly caused by bush fires uh soil erosion etcetera <#/><?/>Erin <name/> Jiko you are from the m
inistry of agriculture you might have something more to tell us <#/>What is the state of the environmental problems in our country
\par <$D> <#/>Well concerning the woman in agriculture I see her environment you know in relation to the health problems that she'
s encountering <#/>You know the undesirable consequences such as backaches headaches you know lethargy and general malaise that is obtained from you know walking long distances you know trekking distances to look for firewood to look for uh uh fodder for 
t
heir animals to look for uh to fetch farm produce to and from the farms and to look for fertile land as a result of environmental destruction that Mrs Maembe talked about <#/>So really that's how I view the environmental uh problem in <-/>in our country a
s relation to the woman herself
\par <$B> <#/>uh According to what you talked about he it seems that the state of environmental problems in our country is threatening because still women have to walk long distances to fetch water to look for firewood or to look 
for fertile land <#/>So uh can we ask ourselves why is it so <#/>Is there any reason that contributed to this state Mrs Maembe
\par <$A> <#/>There are a lot of factors which have contributed to environmental problems in our country <#/>I would rather say <-/>say the first thing that environmental awareness in our country is very low <#/>Sometimes people are doing }{\b\v\fs24 
<&/>grammar}{\fs24  things unknowingly <#/>For example in cases whereby you have people cutting a lot of uh trees for charcoal making sometimes they know that 
they uh <-/>they are destroying the environment but circumstances force them to do so because of social economic problems and in certain cases you have no alternative sources of energy so you will be resolved to go to cutting }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{
\fs24  trees rather than 
starve yourself <#/>So one of the factors is that of social economic status of the country <#/>It's contributing a lot to our environmental problems and two in certain cases for example in catchment areas in catchment forests people just go there and cut 
t
heir trees <-_unknowingly><+_not knowing> that those are the sources of rivers those are the sources of water and after some time you find that the rivers the water streams dry up because of destruction of catchment areas though those are just a few cases
 
whereby you have people unknowingly destroy their own environment and another issue again is that we have sometimes inappropriate agricultural practices <#/>People are farming in the marginal lands and on the hill slopes sometimes not practising environme
ntal conservation or environmental management terracing of the hills making water furrows and so on <#/>Those two also contribute very much to environmental problems in our country
\par <$B> <#/>The main reason that contributed to this state of environmental problems in our country which has been said }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24 
 by Mrs Maembe is the economic status of the country <#/>Any Mr Tenyende do you agree that population growth can uh increase can be one of the <-_reason><+_reasons> that contributed to this state 
\par <$C> <#/
>Yeah exactly because uh the destruction the degradation of environment is due to human activity Now this the output outcome of the human <./>ac activity depends on two things uh technological practices and the quantity of activity and uh population comes
 in because as population increases even }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24 
 human activity increases <#/>More and more people for example our country depends on agriculture <#/>Now when the population increases it means more and more land is put under agriculture <#/>As Mrs Maembe
 has mentioned because of population increase the good fertile land is scarce that}{\b\fs24  }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 the additional population moves into marginal land and given the level of technology we have the outcome is soil erosion uh and other degradations of the land an
d therefore population is quite key because even the system of farming changes <#/>When there was small population }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\b\fs24  }{\fs24 
in the country uh shifting cultivation was very useful because you cultivate this plot this year and you leave it to recover and you're coming back }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 when it is also again fertile <#/>Today it's not <./>pess possible any more because of the concentration of people due to population growth 
\par <$B> <#/>So Mr Tenyende you really agree that population growth <./>incr uh <-_increase><+_increases> the state of environmental problems in our country and <?/>Erin <name/> Jiko what do you say about it
\par <$D> <#/>Well on the better methods of farming uh like the advocating of the use of chemical fertilisers there I see uh another problem 
emerging really in trying to solve uh the problem of conserving the land of fertilising the soil <#/>I'm still on the conservation of the human resources actually or when they apply chemical fertilisers and pesticides and all other agrochemicals most of t
he farmers and uh including women they }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  do not have uh protective clothing <#/>The issue of protective clothing or protective gear you know things like gloves and gum boots so these ones }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 really have got a lot of uh uh negative health 
impact <#/>I look at it is as a very big uh contributing factor to environmental degradation particularly in their health <#/>We advocate in our training sessions that okay gloves should be used and whatnot but then the limitation comes to the availabilit
y of these uh protective <-/>protective gear }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 I rarely see <-_>I rarely see<-/> so sometimes when we are trying to conserve in the environment when trying to we're trying to conserve the natural <./>re resources and then on the other hand we dest
roy the human resources so the application of chemical fertilisers is one of the contributions to the detriment of environment
\par <$B> <#/>uh We have got different opinions on to why uh the state of environment problems in our country is threatening <#/>And u
h we found that the awareness is very low so people don't know the alternative sources of energy to use uh <#/>We heard that <./>popul when population increases the human activity is increasing and so <./>mo more land is used <#/>And uh in that case the f
ertile land is not enough for all people to uh take part }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24 
 in it And uh <?/>Erin <name/> Jiko has reminded us something about protective clothing when using agrochemicals <#/>All these are factors that contribute to environmental problems in our co
untry <#/>But on the other hand women have the <-/>have a big role to play in conserving this environment <#/>What measures women take }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  in conserving the environment in Tanzania Mr Tenyende
\par <$C> <#/>Well it is sometimes <-_difficulty><+-diffivul
t> to outline exactly what women take to conserve uh environment because they are working or their activities are within the social context uh where they are not working alone uh <#/>One of the main <-_area><+_areas> which I think is appropriate for women
 
to take is first of all to move themselves from the social status they <-/>they have today where they don't have uh the freedom to make decisions <#/>It appears most of the crucial critical uh decisions in relation to the use of resources is undertaken by
 men and therefore either way I feel it is that women have very limited <-_opportunity><+_opportunities> uh to undertake conservation uh uh natural resource conservation because of their <-/>their status in the social <-_>in the social<-/> field 
\par <$B> <#/>Yes women have uh limited opportunity to conserve the environment <./>i in Tanzania but they have their measures uh in which they take part in conserving the environment and that's what we want to know <X_>}{\v\fs24  <?/>Erin <name/> Jiko
\par <$D> <#/>Yes I tend to agree to s
ome extent uh with Mr Tenyende uh When we advocate <-_of> agro-forestry as a measure of <./>con conservation of natural resources it's a very uh important uh way of <./>protect protecting the land particularly it's a form of you know using one form of nat
u
ral resources in <-/>in the form of one's domesticated trees to <?/>manage other resources like uh land <-/>land and water within the farming system But the issue at stake as you know Mr Tenyende has said one would be you know what kind of trees to be pla
n
ted and then what is their purpose And then the big issue that Mr Tenyende is really or was talking about is uh where they are planted that is on whose plot Is it on the <-_>on the<-/> family plot on the husband's plot or on the wife's herself So there th
e
 question of really decision making I mean is it possible or is it easy for a woman to plant perennial trees for example those you know trees that stay for a long time on the soil on a plot which is you know is not wholly theirs So I think you know that o
ne really <-_need><+_needs> to be addressed before they can be able }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24  to effectively perform you know conserve the soil using agro-forestry 
\par <$B> <#/>Mrs Maembe do you support it 
\par <$A> <#/>I support the idea partially but in my opinion I still thi
nk that women have a very big role to play in environmental management bearing in mind that women are the principal sufferers of environment problems They are the people who are mostly affected by firewood fetching water fetching walking long distances in
 
<./>dr <-/>in search of firewood and water and so on So as environmental victims they are in a better position to understand what conservation measures they should take For example we have women groups like the Morogoro women tree-planting group They are 
really busy trying to plant trees and as a group they can their voice much better than on }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\v\fs24 
 individual basis so <-_in><+_from> this one example we can say that women are doing something but one big problem is that women at the moment are less unit
ed in groups They don't have enough time to sit together <-/>together as groups and try to do something for environmental conservation for today and for their children in the future So in this case women have ample time to contribute <-_in><+_to> environm
e
ntal management but <-_real><+_really> they need to be given time and resource ownership in that case There are cases whereby women are really interested in planting trees but in certain <./>cu traditions women are not allowed to own land As a result you 
have <./>tr <-_>you have<-/> your tree seedlings but you can't plant them without your husband's or your brother's or your uncle's consent so in that case you are limited by natural resources ownership legislation
\par <$B> <#/><?/>Erin has something to add
\par <$D>
 <#/>Yes they've got uh women have got other practices that they can use you know in conserving environments and those ones are really not dependent on you know whether the land is theirs or it's not theirs There are other practices that are <./>perf perf
o
rmed in agriculture such as mulching and crop rotation which are used to control weeds so uh those practices will minimise the use of agrochemicals uh will minimise the use of herbicides and these practices are practical although you know admittedly not a
ll crops respond to these}{\fs24  </X></I>

\par }{\fs24 <I> <$E> Meeting of the Minds <#/>Hello and welcome to our discussion programme known as Meeting of the
 Minds <#/>Population is a sensitive issue which is now a major topic of discussion in various international fora because of the rapid population growth especially in developing countries <#/>In this first instalment in Two we'll look at among other thing
s
 the implication of population increase <-_to><+_for> the development process <#/>Taking part in this discussion are Dr Flavian Magari National Programme Officer United Nations Population Fund Mrs Christine Nsekella Executive Director of Tanzania Family P
lanning Commission and Mr Ulinyelusura Tenyende Assistant Director Human Resource Planning <#/>Leonard Mtawa is the moderator <#/>The programme sets the scene with Dr Flavian Magari 
\par <$B> <#/>Our population according to the nineteen eighty-eight census is a
bout twenty-three million and uh the growth rate is put at around two point eight per cent <#/>With this growth uh our population is expected to double uh in the next twenty-five years <#/>That means our population will be over forty-five million uh in th
e next within uh our lifetime 
\par <$A> <#/>For a layman when you mention something like population problem please can you explain it in a language whereby somebody can understand <#/>What do you mean by population problem
\par <$B> <#/>Well what we mean by populati
on problem can be explained in the in various contexts <#/>We can look at the population problem from the point of view of our economy our social services <#/>We can look at the <./>pr uh the problem of population from the point of view of environment and
 also from the point <-/>point of view of the health of the mothers and the family in general <#/>So these are the major areas uh of the population problem I think which we should discuss in our discussion today 
\par <$A> <#/>Since the question of economy has been raised as uh one of the major contributing <-_factor><+-factors> to the uh <-_>to the<-/> magnitude of population problem now <#/>Mr Ulinyselusura Tenyende what do you have to say on that area
\par <$C> <#/>uh Mr Moderator I would firstly say that here we a
re talking of population by which we mean the number of people in a country and uh that is this number which makes up the nation of that country and uh it is the concern of that < />co uh of <-/>of that nation that this population enjoys a certain type of
 
life and therefore it is the government's task and it has been a task to find ways of raising the standard of living of Tanzanians who make the population of Tanzania and give them the capacity to further develop themselves uh <#/>Now it becomes a problem
 
in today's world mainly for two reasons <#/>First we are looking in the future we are looking at the rate of growth of the population <#/>From the nineteen eighty-eight census we saw that the intercensal growth rate that is the rate from nineteen seventy-
eight to nineteen eighty-eight was two point eight per cent and that by historical standards and by world standards is a very big rate of growth <#/>As Dr Magari was saying it is this rate of growth which makes the population to double}{\b\fs24  }{
\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  in a very
 short time <#/>Secondly is the fact that we relate this population growth and economic performance because we <-_wants><+_want> this population to be composed of well uh well-fed individuals <#/>Now we look that if the economy is growing at this rate and
 
that population is growing at this rate you can see whether the economy can sustain you see the population which is growing like this <#/>Now given the short period of independence and particularly the crisis we have had since nineteen eighty statistics <
-_shows><+_show> that if the economy is not going to increase to grow }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  given this rate of growth of the population of course it indicates }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24  problem
\par <$A> <#/><ea/>Mama Christine Nsekella it's now your turn and since you are from the Tanz
ania Family Planning Association you are dealing with the planning of <-_>the uh planning of<-/> the family <#/>Maybe uh you have something to tell us why uh I mean the nature of the problem how it appears that we have }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 population problem
\par <$D> <#/>Well it appears that we have uh family or population problems is }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 that maybe over the years quite a number of people have not been conscious of planning their own families uh compared to the resources that they have within their home first of
 all uh which adds up to a problem <-_to><+_for> the < />nat nation <#/>As a nation uh one really depends on how < />m how many people increase in a family in a given number of years <#/>So the nation tends to gain more people if uh the individual familie
s
 are not planned uh <#/>This is why the Family Planning Association has been engaged in educating the people the Tanzanians on why it is important for them to plan their families and how they can plan because we think it is a human right for each Tanzania
n to be able first of all to know why it is important to plan their families and how to plan <#/>And for those who have reached the age of uh bearing children to be able to get the services so that they can be able }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 to plan their own families <#/>It is important because if you look at the family of today uh the family that requires all the necessary amenities in the home uh <#/>With that }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 
I mean proper clothing proper shelter uh proper education and proper love motherly and fatherly love <
#/>The love that is needed for each individual child uh <#/>I think it is important that Tanzanians should be able to know all this and to relate their uh ability to take care of their children as well as to see the resources that are made available to ea
ch member of the family <#/>It can be a problem as Mr uh Tenyende has just pointed }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24 
 that if numbers are not planned according to the social economic development of the country then at individual level as well as at national level our population is u
h going to be continuously under-developed and therefore will have to suffer in many ways both socially and economically
\par <$A> <#/>As to what extent is the public is I mean the public awareness is on the population problems }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  and the issues of family planning
\par <$D> <#/>Well currently I would say that uh we think we have managed to reach to }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\b\fs24  }{\fs24 quite a large portion of the population but that is that is not enough because there is always some new peoples }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar
}{\b\fs24  }{\fs24 there's always some people th
at need more information and need articulated information and services at the same time <#/>We think uh quite a number of people are aware of why it is important for them to plan their families and how dangerous }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 unplanned population can be to a
 nation uh but this kind of awareness has to be related to the provisions of the services that are available in the country because it's no good just educating people making them aware without matching the information with the services that are aware are 
<-/>are available uh for them to use in the country and this is where uh the service provision comes in by uh }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 private sector by the government particularly and by the uh association itself uh <#/>The services are there but probably we need to intensify more and that is not the only intervention to help the population problem issue <#/>There are many more others 

\par <$A> <#/>Dr Flavian Magari hopefully after discussing uh briefly on }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24  the <-/>the problem of population in our situation uh our listeners are at least aware of how the situation is <#/>Now what is currently done }{\b\v\fs24 
<&/>grammar}{\fs24  to uh whether to control or to overcome such a <-/>a situation
\par <$B> <#/>Well thank you very much Mr Mtawa <#/>I think I would like to <-/>to take a point of the 
problems a little further problems associated with the rapid population growth <#/>I think there are two major areas which we have to bring to light <#/>One of them is the environment uh <#/>Our environment is very much uh }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 vulnerable uh althoug
h we do not have deserts now but we have some areas in this country which are threatened uh by the desert and we you uh we have some clear examples in Shinyanga Region and there's there are other regions which are threatened like Iringa Mbeya uh and other
s
 <#/>So as long as you have a rapid population uh their demands for fuel their demands for areas to cultivate they increase the people increase uh the number of cattle they have and the other <-/>other animals and all these have got a bearing on our envir
o
nment uh and this is not to mention urban areas where uh the population problem is being felt <#/>In areas like Dar es Salaam and <-/>and and other towns uh and <-/>and particularly in some regions like uh <-/>like <-/>like Kilimanjaro they really feel th
e
 pinch of the problem of population growth <#/>Another area which I think we should mention uh is the from the health point of view <#/>From this point of view we have one of the questions is malnutrition <#/>We have a big problem of malnutrition in this 
c
ountry <#/>Almost fifty per cent of our children under five have uh malnutrition <#/>Most of it is moderate but uh five to eight per cent is severe malnutrition uh <#/>This is because they don't get enough to eat uh <#/>Although we can say that there are 
s
ome areas in this region where food is growing is in plenty but still we find that we have this problem in quite a number of areas and uh malnutrition is generally a problem <#/>But uh I would like to uh to concentrate mainly on the health of the mothers 
w
hich is very much affected by uh too early pregnancies close too close pregnancies and also too late pregnancies <#/>When I say too early I mean where women or young mothers decide to have children before they are physiologically or they are their bodies 
a
re able to have children and they and therefore uh well let's say not only physiological but also socially and mentally uh ready to have children to rear them in <-/>in the <-_>in the<-/> way that <ea/>Mama Nsekella has explained <#/>And also uh there are
 
a lot of dangers that uh that mothers face when they < />ha when they have their children too close uh between if they have their children uh within a year or two it may be very dangerous for the health of the mother so we so it is uh being uh we try to <
-
/>to <-/>to <-/>to <-/>to promote this idea of spacing the children <#/>And also getting the children too late over thirty-five over thirty-five years of age it is often dangerous for the mother <#/>Now the major problem that we see is maternal mortality 
t
hat is death in uh in women that <-_occur><+_occurs> during the process of childbirth or during pregnancy <#/>And in Tanzania about four thousand uh mothers die every year uh from childbirth or also during pregnancy <#/>This is a very high rate compared t
o
 our uh colleagues in the developing <./>count countries in the developed countries and it appears uh that this is almost forty-six times the level that is seen in the developed countries <#/>Apart from that you we get the problems of maternal <O/> that i
s
 uh the illness that is associated if <-/>if they don't die <#/>Sometimes they get some severe damage to the soft tissues some become infertile uh others become uh immobilized for quite a long time in hospital <#/>So all this is associated with uh <-/>wit
h
 <-/>with childbirth <#/>Another area which I think is very important to <-/>to look at is a question of the effect of uh the death of the mother on surviving children <#/>It has been found that in <./>s <-/>in quite a number of studies that uh if a mothe
r dies the chances that uh her child if the child is under one the <./>s the chances that that child will survive beyond the first year are very low almost uh eighty to ninety-five percent of these children die if their mothers die at birth }{\b\v\fs24 
<&/>grammar}{\fs24  uh <
#/>But coming back to your <-_>to your<-/> question I think when you look at uh at these problems which have been raised uh one of the interventions which uh we're promoting is family planning <#/>As <ea/>Mama Nsekella <-/>Nsekella said we provide family 
p
lanning and we promote uh family planning because it allows the families to plan their next child <#/>Uh And planning means the mother I mean the couple husband and wife should come should discuss as to when they would like to have their next child and we
 have the means to <-/>to for to help them postpone the next pregnancy until such time that they feel they're ready to have the next one
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24 Maybe I should stop there before and let my colleagues uh take their points further
\par <$A> <#/>Uh yah I think Tenyende you <-/>you have something to enlighten us on that area as far as your position is concerned
\par <$C> <#/>Yes Mr Mtawa Let me make it clear that uh we are not so worried by the size of the population We are worried by the rate because sometimes size means power f
or the nation but it becomes power only when that population is composed of healthy and strong uh individuals and by health I'm not uh only talking of uh the individuals not feeling sick and weak but I'm also thinking of health mentally and to have appeti
te to change Now having said that we are saying that }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\v\fs24  population in Tanzania }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\v\fs24 
 population growth rate is in Tanzania is high because of the experience we have had in the past three decades We all we are saying is that if things continue
 this way unchanged of course that is calling trouble but we are not saying that we shall continue this and the hope and purpose of these discussions is to try to enlighten people and see problems and make them ready to change Now as far as that concerned
 }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24  and actually the planning commission aims beyond mere health uh aims beyond just seeing that there is <O/> What we want is to find ways to educate people see }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24 
 problems and find ways of solving problems Now population growth is brough
t about by what happens at the family level Now it is the childbirth at the family level which increases the population It is the person who dies at the family level who reduces uh the <-/>the population and that is where family planning comes in We are s
a
ying that family planning has a contribution to health because spacing allows children to grow smoothly allows the mother to gain health before <-_he><+-she> gets another child Having a planned size you see allows a person even to plan his whole developme
nt and therefore some of us say that family planning taking family planning to every household is taking development to the household We are saying that because it is the healthy family which will be able to develop fast and since the nation is composed}{
\b\v\fs24  <+_of>}{\v\fs24 
 the totality of families if these families are healthy and they are able to develop themselves it means the nation too will be able to develop itself and uh therefore family planning has about three roles First taking development planning to the family
 level and secondly assisting in producing }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article}{\v\fs24 
> <-_health><+-health> <-/>health population because family planning contributes to health and <./>second uh thirdly family planning because childbearing is increases population that when you plan childb
earing it means you're also planning population growth You see that is how I see the interaction between population growth and family planning A lot of people are suspicious and in many cases this discussion is very controversial because people look at on
e side only that somebody is trying to incite us uh to <-/>to reduce population size uh and that is not true uh Family planning when looked it }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\v\fs24  }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24  positively it's a very constructive exercise

\par <$A> <#/>But uh I'm worried <ea/>Mama Nsekella on }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\v\fs24 
 this question of spacing whether it's easily handled because there are pregnancies through married couples and there is an increasing rate of pregnancies from the pre-marriages I don't know how what kind of <./>ex expertise do you do }{\b\v\fs24 
<&/>lexeme}{\v\fs24  to <-/>to handle such a situation
\par <$D> <#/>Yeah This uh question that is commonly asked by quite a number of people You may recall maybe you 're too young to recall but I can recall some cases during my own young <-/>young age that such cases of uh pre-mar
riage pregnancies were very few when I was a young girl and this may have been because some traditions that were taught back at home were observed by the young people and therefore there were not so many pregnancies at that time for girls who were in scho
o
l or before marriage uh One of our roles in family planning and in population uh activities we think it is important for those who are interested in population and development to talk about family life education to talk about the need for the young people
 
to know why it is important to plan their families until such time they are ready to have children and to take care of them when as Doctor Magari has said uh when they're they are physically developed and mentally ready and economically able to look after
 
their children We think uh such education should be introduced both at home as well as in schools as party or as part and parcel of the uh normal uh lessons that young people are taught at school But uh I think it should be a subject that is discussed als
o
 in the communities as well as in adult education classes because once it is a subject that is commonly known and commonly appreciated by the community it will be easier for such young people to receive such education that is approved by their parents by 
t
heir relatives uh in the community to be easily introduced into schools' curricula as a necessary uh uh aspect of education Uh We think that kind of education <./>shou should include uh environmental uh uh education because it is these people that are goi
ng to be using the natural resources that have been inherited by us Now they are being destroyed by the population today just because there have been no preparation }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24 
 for such a <./>pop population to use up the natural resources that we have

\par }{\fs24 <I> <$E> <#/>Meeting of the Minds <#/>Hello and welcome to our discussion programme known as Meeting of the Minds the second
 and last instalment to discuss population and family planning <#/>Last week we finished off with <ea/>Mama Christine Nsekella talking about how in the olden days both boys and girls were adequately prepared to take up their parental roles <#/>She was cri
t
ically examining the problem of experimenting in sex very early in life with little or no preparation <#/>Members of the panel include Dr Flavian Magari National Programme Officer with United Nations Population Fund Dr Ali Mzige Senior Medical Officer in 
the Ministry of Health Mrs Christine Nsekella Executive Director of Tanzania Family Planning Association and Mr Ulinyeluswa Tenyende Assistant Director Human Resource Planning <#/>The Moderator is Leonard Mtawa and Dr Magari picks }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{
\fs24  where <ea/>Mama Nsekella left off 
\par <$B> <#/>I would like to take uh <ea/>Mama Nsekella's uh point a little further uh <#/>It is a fact today that uh the norms that uh were prevalent during her times when she was young are no longer uh prevailing <#/>During those times uh t
raditionally we had <ea_>}{\b\v\fs24 two words}{\fs24 
<ea/> which was a way uh to teach the young people young men and young women uh on changes during <-/>during adolescent changes during when they grow up become adults they were taught about uh what to expect when they get 
married or when they marry <#/>They were also taught about how to take care of their families <#/>But due to the developments uh and children have got to stay in school for a long time and uh you know families have moved into towns and so on these norms a
r
e no longer being practised in the majority of cultures <#/>So we have to find alternative ways of imparting that education to the young generation and as she said one way is to introduce uh what we call family life education in schools and in fact I woul
d
 like to point out here that uh there is a project which is being <./>supp assisted by UNFPA in the Ministry of Education that is family life education project with the aims uh which have been stated i e to improve or to uh bring awareness among the schoo
l
children uh about uh their <./>b the biology and uh issues related to environment issues related to growing up and so on <#/>So we hope that when this project becomes operational in the country we should be able to have our children at least to <-/>to get
 }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 some information about growing up and uh family life education <#/><./>Anoth another project uh which is being sponsored by uh the United Nations Population Fund is uh family life education with the with <ea/>wazazi which a part-time Masai orga
nisation uh whereby we are also trying to see how uh the parents can play their role to educate their sons and daughters in order for them to understand what it means to grow up uh in a way to improve communication between parents and children in the whol
e question of family life uh <#/>There\rquote 
s another big project under the prime minister's office that is uh population and family life education uh based in Arusha but also operating in about six regions and again uh it is trying in a way to impart knowledge 
of about population and economic development through extension workers and also trying to reach the grass-roots through the extension workers
\par <$A> <#/><ea/>Mama Nsekella I have a small question here <#/>Now uh don't you think that it is possible to revive the old norms
\par <$C> <#/>Well uh this is why I brought it up uh because I knew it is possible <#/>We still have some very good norms within our society whereby uh we can be uh of help to those that are engaged in <./>t teaching and training young people so t
hat it can be integrated within the society especially in adult education classes so that when the kids from school or they are on leave or holiday they can be looked after by the older generation and be taught some good behaviour as to how they should re
late themselves to}{\b\fs24  }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 opposite sex uh not only on matters relating to sex but to general good behaviour in society so that our children can continue to be responsible and growing to a responsible society later on uh <#/>We still think that uh such 
people that have been able to pass on uh good norms to }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24  younger generation could be usefully uh be utilised by the school systems in the parents' committees in the parents\rquote 
 association by passing on the good behaviour and good way of living in a community especially in the rural areas and in the urban areas
\par <$A> <#/><ea/>Ndugu Ulinyeluswa <./>Ten Tenyende there is uh this question of economic crisis uh among the young people be uh women or men }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  <#/>I How can you relate with the <-/>the current population problem 
\par <$D> <#/>Yeah these problems you have stated particularly youth unemployment problems uh are very much related to the population situation <#/>As you know we practise we have achieved universal primary education in Tanzania and
 as you're also aware that it\rquote 
s a very small proportion which continues to go beyond uh primary school education about less than six per cent <#/>Now it means that among say five hundred thousand youths who complete class seven every year go into the labou
r market seeking jobs <#/>A labour market which is not capable to absorb them <#/>That by itself is a problem uh and that is why the government now <-_realise><+_realises> that it has to have some policy a population policy to tackle these problems uh <#/
>
A policy which also aims to streamline the existing population programmes like family planning uh programmes family life education programmes so that they are united together to solve this population problem <#/>You know most of these problems can't be so
l
ved by saying that uh you what you have to do is to family plan you see or take people back to the <-_>to the<-/> <-_>to the<-/> <-_>to the<-/> rural areas <#/>Actually these are most of them socio-economic problems and therefore sometimes solutions are i
n
 the social field <#/>And what we are saying that to make the whole thing complete to uh to <-/>to make development planning complete we have uh to consider all the problems together you see <#/>The numbers of people it's like water you know <#/>When you 
have too much water it's a problem <#/>We are always working on average <#/>Even fire itself it\rquote 
s very useful you see <#/>If you don't make use it <./>o <./>o of it properly It's the same with numbers of people <#/>We are saying that we have to be growing in a manner which it helps }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 the nation's and individual's development in Tanzania and that is why the government also decided to come up with a population policy which we hope soon it will be adopted }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
\par <$A> <#/>Dr Flavian Magari you as 
the national programme officer in the United Nations Population Fund uh maybe <./>w we would like to know uh what actually what is specifically is being done by your organisation on this question of interelations of population and family planning problems
 
\par <$B> <#/>Most parents <./>esp particularly in the rural areas favour to have }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 large families <#/>One for one for one reason that uh they aren't quite sure whether all of them will survive <#/>That's one problem <#/>Of course the others uh anoth
er <-/>another reason people may have is security and maybe there could be others In any case when it comes to ensuring survival of the children uh our role is to ensure that we have good uh maternal and child health services mother and child health servi
c
es uh <#/>A lot has been done in this country to expand primary health care services to the country in such a way that uh more than seventy per cent of the population is within walking distance from the near from the nearest health unit <#/>And therefore 
u
h these clinics these dispensaries which provide uh maternal and child health care have a big role to play in order to ensure that first the mothers uh get good care while they're pregnant and when they deliver and <-/>and also the children that are born 
a
re immunised they're given uh all the care that is needed in order to make them survive <#/>Now if we can make these children survive then that reason for having a larger family uh becomes not uh a non-issue and therefore our organisation uh is working ha
n
d in hand with the Ministry of Health to <./>e <-/>to strengthen as well as to expand uh <./>mo mother and child health services and family planning services in the country in order to meet uh the demand for these services <#/>So that is one area where we
 
are <-_>we are<-/> very much uh uh active in <#/>The other area of course as I say is this whole area of raising awareness about uh uh population issues about uh uh health issues uh family planning issues among the general population among leaders uh what
 
government party and religious <-/>religious leaders <#/>So we have got to tackle the problem not just from uh one angle but from various <-_angle><+-angles> <#/>Raising awareness uh improving <./>info information to the people improving the services and 
w
e hope through all this people will be in a position to make uh uh rational decisions to have the families that they need the size of the families that they need that they can afford to keep healthy economically stable socially stable spiritually stable a
lso 
\par <$A> <#/>Can you mention the problem of work in executing your functions on this particular area of population and family planning <#/>I mean how do you <./>g <-_>do you<-/> go about executing your uh your functions 
\par <$B> <#/>uh In fact our role really
 is to support the government <#/>Our projects are executed by the <-_>by the<-/> government <#/>So the <-/>the government comes up with a <-_>with a<-/> programme or a project which aims at improving let's say uh services in the clinics <./>mo mother and
 
child health services and family planning services in the clinic and then we <-/>we look at the project we come to agreement as to uh the rationale of this <-_>of this<-/> uh of the proposal and our <-/>our organisation uh goes ahead if it if <-/>if <-/>i
f the project is approved go ahead to uh <-/>to get funds to the government uh to get the <-/>the activities done <#/>So that is the way we operate <#/>So <-/>so our projects are <./>mai <./>rea really operated by the government but we are partners
\par <$A> <#/><ea/>Ndugu Tenyende maybe for the benefit of our listeners I <-/>I propose that you give them you give us the national stand on that <./>iss that is you explain the population policy <#/>How is it 
\par <$D> <#/>A population policy aims at solving problems which come from }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24  population growth rate and population characteristics <#/>One area is health for example <#/>We are talking }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24 
 that mortality in Tanzania is very high compared to other countries <#/>Mortality is an aspect of population <#/>it's a component of population change and mortality we don\rquote t <#/>it\rquote 
s something which everybody uh fights and it is one of the enemies the nation has declared war }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  that is disease <#/>Now a population policy will emphasise and put more energy e
ffort towards eradicating disease and reducing death in the nation <#/>We have already mentioned that uh the population growth rate is high both by historical standards in Tanzania itself and by world standards 
\par <$A> <#/>Maybe before going further
\par <$D> <#/>Yeah
\par <$A> <#/>I would like to know is there are any policy of that kind 
\par <$D> <#/>No there is no policy of that kind <#/>I think I made it clear right from the beginning that the government is now aware of these problems and therefore it is trying to come up with a policy which I think it may be adopted soon }{\b\v\fs24 
<&/>grammar}{\fs24  <#/>We don't have a population <./>po right now <#/>I am only saying what a population policy can be doing 
\par <$A> <#/>Yeah so we should also say that the delay for having }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  such }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24  policy is also one of the reasons of the problems now facing the areas of population
\par <$D> <#/>No I <./>wou I <-/>I wouldn't say so }{\b\v\fs24 <&/><$A> <#/>laughs }{\fs24 <#/>I wouldn't say so because population is a very sensitive area <#/>It is not only related to
 the number of the population <#/>It is also related to the quality of the population <#/>There are some population policies which aim for example to further certain characteristics of the population uh <#/>You would you wouldn't like to see in your popul
a
tion a certain type of people and therefore your population policy would be geared towards the removing those characteristics in the population that is also population and therefore we want to be sure that the population that we shall be coming with comin
g up with is really constructive population uh a policy 
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24 I wouldn\rquote t say that the delaying it after all the impact of population is not in terms of ten years It\rquote s a long it\rquote s a <?/>person to feel the employment impact of a person born today it is up to fifte
en years That is when he goes into the labour and therefore when you talk in terms of one year two years five years you can\rquote t say that act is really bringing up population policy
\par <$A> <#/>Yah Thank you for your enlightenment Maybe <ea/>Mama Nsekella you have something to add
\par <$C> <#/>Well as he just said population policy although it <-/>it is not ready now but the thought of it is a very big forward uh a very big step forward for <-/>for Tanzania and because the government is being very careful to involve 
all those that are going to take part in the implementation of the policy it is a good thing So when it comes into operation then we it will be made sure that uh we are <-/>are going into the right direction Well earlier on you asked on }{\b\v\fs24 
<&/>prep}{\v\fs24  the interv
entions that uh some of the people that are involved in uh trying to implement or to give family planning or population activities I would like uh to spell out a few things that is doing with some kind of success and these are the community based uh distr
i
bution of services by lay people young people that have been trained in providing such a service without uh wanting a medical prescription And we have been able to start this kind of project in uh a number of villages surrounding Dar es Salaam in almost t
w
enty-five villages in Dar es Salaam We also have a project in Kilimanjaro which now has expanded to Morogoro which is an integrated project that looks at health problems of the people in the local area And with the people we work out together as to what t
y
pe of health problem that they have With that uh we introduce family planning after having helped solve the problem the health problem of the people And in Kilimanjaro where we started uh when we started going back in nineteen eighty-four the uh acceptanc
e
 rate of family planning services was quite low It was lower than ten per cent and that area now the <-/>the <-/>the acceptance rate has increased to forty-six point five per cent which is uh something that we think can work out in other areas We have jus
t introduced some other uh aspect to family planning which is voluntary sterilisation People come they say I have five kids and I don\rquote t think I can manage a sixth one or a seventh one }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24 
 Although the national average of uh family size is about seven children some people are now opting to having }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24 
 six or five so why should this woman continue having children without choosing to have six children So when they come with their partners they say we have now completed our family can we get steri
lised And so the sterilisation service is provided to one of the partners uh We are of the opinion that if the services are provided uh in a comprehensive way If they go together with the education and information and motivation <-_to><+_of> the people we
 could get somewhere
\par <$A> <#/>I see Now Doctor Magari the ball is now on your court I hope you will want to make some more points on that
\par <$B> <#/>Yes I would like to come back to the question you raised about population policy uh We have been uh very much 
involved in uh assisting the planning commission to try and come up with a population policy and we are and we're quite pleased about the development so far The <-/>The draft is uh in its final stages and we hope that as Mr Tenyende said we should expect 
i
t soon We think we need it uh the country needs a population policy needs a population policy mainly to give a sense of direction to <-/>to <-/>to outline clearly what our goals the country goals of our population Where do we want to go and also to allow 
t
o <-/>to enable the ministries to try and focus their efforts towards uh achieving those goals Not only the <-/>the <-/>the government but also the donor agencies they also would wish to see the policy because then uh it may help them to see how they can 
a
ssist the government to in order to achieve the various programmes aimed at achieving the various uh population goals However we are very grateful that uh even without a written population policy the government has allowed a population programme to be imp
lemented in this country That is a great thing indeed
\par <$A> <#/>I see Well we still have some few minutes then hopefully <ea/>Mama Nsekella you have something to sum up
\par <$C> <#/>Well what I can say just now uh is that uh I would like us as Tanzanians to look
 at the population policy as something to help us guide our way of life because that's something that is going to help us uh go uh the direction of social and economic development Without <-/>without a population policy uh most of the people most of the y
o
ung people that come up now uh that are uh being educated that are in the societies we know the population of young people is about fifty per cent and those are the leaders of today and tomorrow If we don't give them a guideline surely they are going to e
n
d up even poorer than uh we are They are not going to get the uh <-/>the proper social services They are not going to get the education they require and deserve and therefore we should look at population policy as a blessing in our community and society W
e need to support the government so that this is implemented as it should be 
\par <$A> <#/><ea/>Ndugu Tenyende 
\par <$D> <#/>Thank you <ea/>Ndugu Mtawa Maybe to finish <-_>to finish<-/> up I should emphasise that uh the family planning will be part of the populatio
n policy but let it not be understood that it is the government's intention to impose on the people how to have children and the number of children to have These will be the options to be taken decisions to be taken by the family itself
\par <$A> <#/>Doctor Magari
\par <$B> <#/>This panel discussion has enabled us to try and examine the population problems in this country and we should not kid ourselves we have a population problem at hand although we have a large country and well we have a large country and the popu
lation does not appear to be big now but sooner or later we are going to have a big problem and the sooner we take action now the better and that's uh that is why at this point in time we really need the population policy 
\par <$E> <#/>Thank you Doctor Magari 
You just listened to the second and final instalment on the question of population and family planning Taking part in the discussion were Doctor Flavian Magari National Programme Officer with United Nations Population Fund Mrs Christine Nsekella Executive

\par }{\v\fs24\lang2057 <&_><$A> Mr Chiza, m.
\par <$B>Mr Willy, m.</&>
\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <I> <$A> <#/>Yuh and Mr Willy I am really thinking of uh a certain issue which is about faith and peace }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 I think that these two issues are a bit related }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 How do you find it 
\par <$B> <#/>What terms what did you say 
\par <$A> <#/>I <-/>I <-/>I <-/>I am introducing uh something about faith and peace
\par <$B> <#/>Yeah
\par <$A> <#/>The way I see it I think that faith has an influence on one's peace uh peace uh peace in <-/>in terms of uh calmness for example spiritually and all calmness maybe uh uh intellectually or calmness even uh the outlook of a person }{\fs24 <#/>}{
\fs24\lang2057 All these symbolise a <-/>a peaceful attitude of a person }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 And I think that faith has }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <+_article>}{\fs24\lang2057  contribution to influence one's peace
\par <$B> <#/>To me I find it uh something that cannot be really }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 You cannot conclude that this <-/>this and that uh have got any contribution to <-/>to <-/>to one's }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Well I don't know I don't know }{
\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Maybe you explain this in deeply }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>idiom}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$A> <#/>Yah uh in fact what I'm saying is uh that when one has faith in God }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
Of course to be specific I I'm referring to religious faith that uh when one believes that indeed there is God and tries his best or tries her best to live according to uh God's uh <-/>God's wish }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 In this way one fin
ds himself or herself uh satisfactory because he <-/>he knows that uh he's living according to God's wishes
\par <$B> <#/>Maybe because you have to find something which will motivate somebody in order to believe that there is a God }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 We for example there are some people who'd never <-/>never< />a agree whether there is a God or not }{
\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 So unless you motivate you <-/>you introduce somebody that this is God there is this there is something like that }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 But it is not easy really to accept there is God because where is He }{\fs24 <#/>}{
\fs24\lang2057 People some people tend to ask you these things }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
There is no God people are I mean people <-/>people always tend to think there is no God so when you say when you somebody believes in God then have peace <-/>peace in <-/>in <-/>in Him then there is this and there is I don't think that is 
\par <$A> <#/>Well yes what you are saying is true and it is very very unfortunate that part some people don't believe that there is God }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 That is really true }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 And I know <-_>I know<-/> some who uh really 
say that uh those who believe in God are conservative and they also say that going to pray is a waste of time uh but
\par <$B> <#/>You believe that is that God is <-/>is <-/>is around
\par <$A> <#/>Of course }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Yes I believe
\par <$B> <#/>What makes you
\par <$A> <#/>so and <-/>and
\par <$B> <#/>But what makes you believe that there is God even around
\par <$A> <#/>Well don't worry }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 I'll just tell you }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 I'll tell you about that I'm trying to go on you see uh }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
It is it needs an experience because the starting point is a true belief that indeed there must be a source of everything and that source we }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Who can say uh it is the origin of everything is God }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
God who said that everything should be there and that is a starting point }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Once you believe that there is God then you c
an see you can try to find out what does God want me to do and from that uh you can try to live according to the standard that God wants you to live for you see }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
And when you achieve maybe a certain standard you become happy and you encounter a peaceful experience you see
\par <$B> <#/>I just want the initial what you say the initial the initial start which will make somebody believe that there's God }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
So if we introduce that we introduce the initial what you call the initial stage towards God's will maybe that's fun }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Maybe you can make me understand what you mean by <-/>by initial }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
Because I don't so far understand what do you mean when somebody gets an initial the initial stage that okay you have to tell somebody that God is like this God is like tha
t then so <-/>so that somebody can understand that the initial stage and then from there then you start maybe it's preaching or whatever or what }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 But so far that is the initial }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
What power what <-/>what kind of power do one get }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  just from the initial start }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Because uh to get that power I think you need to you a kind of a training really
\par <$A> <#/>You see uh as I said before that the <-/>the starting point or the initial point is to believe that there is God
\par <$B> <#/>Right }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Now
\par <$A> <#/>Once you believe that there is God then you <-/>you pray to God
\par <$B> <#/>all right
\par <$A> <#/>asking God uh to enlighten you to know him more
\par <$B> <#/>So what will make me because I can't just <-/>just start to <-/>to pray unless somebody maybe have come }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 and tell me that you see you try to ask God for this and that so you'll <-/>you'll and then you'll get what you <-/>you have been asking }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
But the initial position the initial what about I mean the initial uh which will make somebody I think you need to elaborate some kind of elaboration a bit 
\par <$A> <#/>Yes maybe it was 
\par <$B> <#/>because you see these things of faith when you talk of faith something I think is internal some it's <-/>it's a kind of power maybe which we don't know <-_>we don't know<-/> where really it <./>ori originates }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
Where's the source of this power I think }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 So when you talk <-/>talk of the initial I think that is just people's manipulation of language }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 So that's what 
\par <$A> <#/><./>May <./>may maybe to enlighten you about that it is good to <-/>to take two approaches the scientific approach and the religious approach }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Uh on the scientific point of view }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{
\fs24\lang2057  normally uh the knowledge obtained from that uh <-/>that uh <-/>that view depends on experiments but uh religiously we depend on faith }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 And uh what does this word faith mean }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
It means uh when I have <-_>when I <-/>I have<-/> faith in you it means that what you say I take it as truth }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Now here uh when we <-/>we naturally encounter uh problems uh uh espe
cially critical problems it is there we realise that uh maybe God has deserted me even those who do not believe in God they can even say uh God help me }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
It happens uh that is a <-/>a <-/>a natural a <-/>a <-/>a < />nat there is a natural uh experience which <-_enable<>+_enables> people sometimes to feel that they need God }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
Now the only problem is how to strengthen this so that their faith becomes stronger }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 And maybe I should <-_>I should<-/> introduce you to uh two forces which operate uh uh the within a person
\par <$B> <#/>Maybe just tell me 
\par <$A> <#/>there is Satan <-_>there is Satan<-/> }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 there is God 
\par <$B> <#/>Yes of course
\par <$A> <#/>And normally Satan <-/>Satan does not want us to believe in God and <-/>and that's why we <-/>we tend to ignore on the side of God }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
 because uh we <-/>we <-/>we are easily misled by those who uh believe otherwise
\par <$B> <#/>So you are telling me that when people have got some problems and then they pray and then they are answered their problems so it's when they realise that God is there }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
And therefore if you don't have any problem you don't pray then God is not there }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 That's what you do that's what you mean 
\par <$A> <#/>No no not really
\par <$B> <#/>Yah because you have said if <-/>if you have some problems then you pray }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 You get it }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
Yes you tell somebody you go and pray and that's why people with problems when it when they mean when they prefer saying Oh God help me God do this for me Now }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
So you mean that if you live without problems in this world you live without the problems then God is not there because you haven't you haven't got an opportunity to call God to help you because you don't have problems }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
So if you don't have problems there's no God }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 If you have got if you've ever got some problems then you have to call God to assist you }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 That's what you mean
\par <$A> <#/>Uh in fact there is a relationship in <-/>in that because uh there are people because they are rich they tend to ignore on the religious side }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <$B> <#/>No I know
\par <$A> <#/>There are people 
\par <$B> <#/>know I know a lot 
\par <$A> <#/>There are people 
\par <$B> <#/>I know a lot of people 
\par <$A> <#/>Yes I agree with you there are people who are rich and they believe in God and they pray hard but there are people who are rich also and they ignore }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 because uh I know one person who uh who despised people who were talking about God and uh trying to lament the way people are behaving nowadays and when they sympathised with the way he <-/>he told them he just neglected them and < />sai and 
said that his God is his computer you see }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 And because he was well-off he thought that they are conservative and they are outdated you see }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
And there are people who <-/>who say they will <-_>they will<-/> find God when they have problems but people who have a <-_>who have<-/> problems normally they try to find solutions for them }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
If they said then they say maybe God can help me }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 And there are people indeed who uh <-/>who encounter for example health problems and they go in different places uh to
 uh <-/>to get cure and yet uh <./>the <./>the they are not cured and when they uh <-/>they <-/>they <-/>they go to uh the believers they pray for them and even without medicine they get cured 
\par <$B> <#/>But you see 
\par <$A> <#/>and that that symbolises that uh God's power has uh helped them to become well
\par <$B> <#/>But you see there are people }{\fs24 l}{\fs24\lang2057 et me tell you there are people several <-/>several of them I know that that they have been sick for quite a number <-_>for quite a number<-/> of years }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
They've been suffering }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 They ve gone to the hospital }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 They've gone to <-/>to the medicineman }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 They have gone everywhere to the witchdoctors you see }{\fs24 <#/>}{
\fs24\lang2057 They haven't been cured their diseases }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 So you see what they say }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 They say you see There is no God }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
If God were there he could have helped me }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 He's not here }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 So I just wondering }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 when you say all these things to the question of God is there the question of faith the question of what }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>idiom}{\fs24\lang2057  because there are those people w
ith problems who have not been assisted even <-/>even if < />G you say if we say that God is there and can help people }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
So many that I think you might have this experience too that we've got people for quite a number of years sick for quite a number pra
ying with I mean with well their faith I don't know whether <-/>whether it's what you are talking about faith is whether one needs to pray hard or not but with their faith and then they are dying with their problems then they <-/>they ignore they tend to 
ignore that there is no God because if God was there if God or if Gods are there they could have helped us }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 But you see if God is there and let me suffer with this for how for all these years }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
How can I believe that there is God }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 And if you say yes God is our Father he helps us }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Then he doesn't help you when you have some problems }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
You suffer from <-/>from the < />u day you are born until the day the <-/>the <-/>the day you die }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 So I don't know
\par <$A> <#/>You see we <-/>we can uh cite some people who uh <-/>who had problems and yet they were not uh their problems were not solved }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 They uh prayed hard yet their problems were not solved }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 
And we can also cite some people who had problems and they were solved because they prayed hard uh It is not enough to pray hard }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 One can pray hard and yet not believing }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  }{
\fs24 y}{\fs24\lang2057 ou see }{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 Uh you remember if we take an example one person who had a skin disease and he was told to go to wash himself in the River Jordan and he saw no reason why he should go into that particular river 
}{\fs24 <#/>}{\fs24\lang2057 He saw that in his place <-_/>in his place<-/> there are many rivers and he can he always goes to wash himself in <-/>in those rivers and so he saw no reason of going to wash himself in the River Jordan }{\fs24 <#/>}{
\fs24\lang2057 But uh his advisers said well you have come to this person to seek help and the advice he has given you is to just to go to wash yourself into that river }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 Just go there with faith and when he did after coming out of the river he was completely cured Now uh so here what I'm trying to tell you is that 
\par <$C> <#/>Now well now <-/>now listen
\par <$A> <#/>he had a strong faith
\par <$C> <#/>Just listen D'you believe all these stories because I <-/>I find those suggestive stories that people are narrating these stories about this Jordan and what not
\par <$A> <#/>Yes I believe I do believe Yes yes I do
\par <$C> <#/>So it means that these things are I mean the question of science the <-/>the question of science is not operating in this world Because you mean if somebody we if you are s
ick you <-/>you have to be operated in KIMSI or Muhimbili whatever any hospital because for example they'll just tell you you go and pray then everything <-/>everything will be okay So you don't have to go to the hospital
\par <$A> <#/>You see when God created 
man he gave him two uh <-/>two things which are very important He gave him intelligence and he gave him freedom Now intelligence enables man and as God said that man was to control the world Now controlling the world means using uh uh scientific approach 
that means using the intelligence that God gave him

 week is revisited and hence we join panellists who discussed Does pegging wildlife to the dollar enhance conservation <#/>Taking part are Mrs V D Mtefu from the Board of External Trade Mr B N Samaira from the Export Promotion Depa
rtment Directorate of Economic Research and Policy Bank of Tanzania Mr John Boshe from World Wildlife Fund for Nature Dar es Salaam branch and Dr Kriske of Seluu Conservation Programme <#/>Mr B N Samaira starts the ball rolling
\par <$C> <#/>The subject of cons
ervation is widely known to everybody and for Tanzania the question <-/>o of foreign exchange is also an open game <#/>So in approaching conservation strategies in Tanzania which sometimes to a great <./>ex to a great extent touches some areas of forest g
eneration uh it is very difficult indeed uh <#/>Someone has discussed values of conservation vis-\'e0
-vis forex generation <#/>Now what I can say in this particular subject is conservation this is uh something to be maintained as for heritage for the coming ge
neration and foreign exchange is also a crucial issue because this is the one which uh can put our current and coming generation to order}{\b\fs24  }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>idiom}{\fs24 
 <#/>In this respect I would like to say that conservation should be done uh <-_>should be done<-/> but at th
e same time uh foreign exchange uh generation should be given its due uh <-_>its due<-/> say its due treatment <#/>What I mean in this area is the government or the Tanzanian society being in a very serious <-_economically><+_economic> uh position may ove
r
look some issues which might erode our conservation because of hunting dollars <#/>It is here when we can overlook say the issue of say exporting uh timber or exporting some vital uh government <?/>trophies because of hunting dollars <#/>We can concentrat
e
 on these issues but at the same time actually we are we are eroding our national heritage we are eroding our <-/>our uh forests which in the future might pose a very good uh <-_>a very good<-/> uh reserve for our generation <#/>In this aspect therefore u
h whenever we are <-_>we are<-/> approaching these two issues one should be cautious as not to take the advantage of the other to swallow the other one <#/>As the discussion goes I might be in a better position to address myself }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>idiom}{
\fs24  <#/>Thank you very much
\par <$A> <#/>I think the most important message here passed by Mr Samaira to the audience is that we need foreign currency and we need to conserve our <-_resource><+_resources> but in order to do both we have to try <-_>to try<-/> to the best of our abil
ity to strike uh a balance uh <#/>May I now call upon Mrs Mtefu from the Board of External Trade uh to highlight his idea her ideas on the Does pegging wildlife to the dollar enhance conservation
\par <$B> <#/>Thank you Mr Chairman <#/>With me }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>idiom}{\fs24  I could
 say that pegging <-/>pegging wildlife to the dollar sometimes maybe to some extent it <-/>it can also enhance < />con conservation <#/>It only depends on <-/>on the policies of the nation on that maybe if you are going to <-/>to earn the foreign exchange
 and then utilising it }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  to buy other things instead of concentrating on conserving the wildlife itself so on my part I could say that the government or the policy makers should have }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>lexeme}{\fs24 
 a deliberate and co-ordinated <-_efforts><+-effort> to make sure that what is earned from the wildlife is utilised to conserve wildlife itself <#/>There's no need of <-/>of saying }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 that we are conserving wildlife to the to the extent that the country is going to lose foreign exchange because as fa
r as wildlife is concerned it's not the heritage of Tanzanians only <#/>It's for the whole world <#/>And if it's for the whole world it means some countries are all countries have the right to come and maybe have a look at the at what we have in Tanzania 
<
#/>And by doing so they are paying a fee and if we are earning a fee I would <-_>I would<-/> think that this type of earnings should be used to conserve wildlife <#/>Although the nation might be needing let's say dollars badly but conserving wildlife to m
y
 on my side I think it's a very important aspect otherwise there will come a time that it will only be in the books that Tanzania used <-_>Tanzania used<-/> to have such and such kind of things <#/>It will only be history and to some extent it will be for
gotten <#/>So in order to let's say to make the world enjoy what we have we should conserve and if we have to conserve we have to use money to conserve and the money must come from the sector itself or from other government from other sources but to me }{
\b\v\fs24 <&/>idiom}{\fs24 
 I think that we can we <-/>we <-/>we should have a < />co co-ordinated and deliberate <-_efforts><+_effort> <#/>And the second point is that we should also have proper training because those people who are dealing with let's say from the Bank of Tanz
ania or from the Board of External Trade People are only looking at the dollar aspect of it <#/>Nobody is aware of the conservation part of <-/>of the whole thing <#/>So there should be proper training to all those who are concerned in the sector maybe fr
o
m not only from the wildlife sector but from those let's say all sectors which are inter-related in one way or another <#/>It's to such an extent that policies which are <-/>are being passed by the government are <-/>are well co-ordinated because you'll f
i
nd the Department of Wildlife talking something about <./>con conversation conservation and then you'll find the Board of External Trade maybe promoting trade saying we have to export so we have to export <./>non non-traditional products and wildlife is o
ne of them so you'll find that in some aspects there we have some contradictions one part is conserving and one part is trying to break the rule <#/>So proper training and education and maybe this co-ordination will enable us }{\b\fs24 <+_to>}{\fs24 
 conserve our wildlife <#/>That's all Mr Chairman <#/>Maybe I'll be able to contribute more
\par <$A> <#/>Thank you very much Mrs Mtefu <#/>In addition to uh emphasising the same uh concept of striking a compromise between the dollar and conservation Mrs Mtefu has brought in an additio
nal idea and that is sometimes quite a lot of the problems arise in the industry and which give the impression that maybe the dollar has been over-emphasised <#/>These problems arise because of some form of communication breakdown so she's suggesting in t
h
e industry that there should be some form of education or training or a mechanism of two-way communication between the <./>cons conservationist on one side and the bankers and the people from the external trade uh <#/>Having said that I would like to than
k Mrs Mtefu and then call upon uh Mr Boshe <#/>Mr Boshe is a professional teacher and he has indicated to want }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 to stop to uh to deliver what he has to us while standing up and I have no objection to his uh delivering his talk while he is standing up
\par <$D> <#/>The subject matter we are talking about is very interesting and very very important but I consider that it has been presented in a rather provoking way uh pegging wildlife to the dollar does pegging wildlife to the dollar enhance conservation
 <#/>This may be rather provoking to conservationists but I think this has been done purposely in order to uh to stimulate discussion <#/>Now my interpretation of the subject really is commercial versus subsistence use of wildlife <#/>That's the way I loo
k
 at it and I think that's what we are trying to address here uh <#/>Before I start maybe I should try to define what wildlife is <#/>To me a simple and clear definition of wildlife really would be uh its definition in its <-/>ist broadest sense to be all 
living entity in a natural area and this <-_include><+_includes> plants animals and micro-organisms <#/>Now if we all agree to this definition we will see then there are several values of wildlife and this include }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 commercial value recreational e
ducational aesthetic catchment value and also source of food <#/>These are the main values of wildlife if <-/>if we agree in this definition to start with <#/>Now we can see that most of these cannot have a dollar value attached to them <#/>It is very dif
f
icult to have monetary value attached to something like aesthetic value of wildlife or the catchment or the recreational or the<-/> educational <#/>Now coming back to the question of use of wildlife I believe that wildlife just like any other resource mus
t
 contribute to the national economy and also to the well-being of the people <#/>Therefore commercial use of the resource is essential <#/>Such commercial use can either be consumptive or non-consumptive <#/>Turning to the question of subsistence hunting 
o
r <-/>or use of the wildlife it is now indisputable as I'm sure we will see during the afternoon session that all conservation efforts are likely to fail unless they have active and positive support of the local people <#/>I therefore believe that we cons
ervationists and the responsible authorities have an obligation to demonstrate to the local people that conservation is for their interest }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24 
 by providing direct and tangible benefits of conservation to the local people <#/>Truly we can add and say th
at commercial utilisation of wildlife will eventually provide the needed benefit to the people <#/>We get tourists in the country we collect a lot of forex and the money goes to the government and uh we assume that this money will filter down to the local
 
people but in reality when it comes to wildlife issues and the money generated by the wildlife the trickle-down theory does not work <#/>It does not apply <#/>The money goes to the government <#/>the government uses the money for development projects but 
t
he people living next door to the wildlife do not really see the contribution of wildlife to their well-being <#/>As you will agree with me I'm sure wildlife <-_occur><+_occurs> in land which <-_belong><+_belongs> to people <#/>Let us take the northern pa
rt of the country for example uh <#/>We have some of the most outstanding wildlife areas in the Arusha region and in Masai land}{\v\fs24  }{\fs24 
This land<-_belong><+_belongs> to the Masais traditionally and they have been there from time immemorial <#/>Now this wildlife is there because the form of land use <./>practise practised by the Masai is compatible}{\b\fs24  }{\b\v\fs24 <+_with>}{\v\fs24 
 }{\fs24 conservation <#/>Now things are changing <#/>Human population is increasing <#/>Human needs are increasing <#/>}{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24  Lifestyle of the Masai is changing as 
well from pastoralists to start producing < />ag uh uh agricultural goods <#/>Now cultivating the land I am sure some of you would agree with me is not a compatible form of land use with wildlife conservation <#/>Now if we try to prevent the Masais for ex
ample from cultivating the land so that wildlife can survive then we have an obligation to make sure that the Masais get their basic needs <#/>If you look at uh the Chagga people for example in }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 northern part of the country they have pieces of land which they have inherited from their forefathers <#/>This piece of land }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 they grow banana as their food crop and coffee as a cash crop and they depend entirely on this small piece of land <#/>Now the Masais on the other hand have this land wh
ich <-_belong><+_belongs> to them <#/>There is wildlife there <#/>They cannot cultivate the land and grow food crop or cash crop }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 <#/>So their cash crop really would be the wildlife on their land but then there isn't a mechanism which can provid
e direct income from wildlife to the Masai people <#/>So what I'm trying to drive at here is in addition to commercial utilisation of wildlife where we get some money forex for example here is also in need to uh support subsistence utilisation of wildlife
 
for the purpose of providing the needed uh uh the basic needs for these people living next door to wildlife <#/>Now in conclusion Mr Chairman I would like to say that wildlife resource has a major role to play in both the national economy and in serving a
s
 a source of food to people especially to those communities living in and around conservation areas <#/>This therefore calls for both commercial and subsistence use of the resource <#/>Our main concern here though is the magnitude and extent of the use of
 this resource whether commercial or subsistence
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24 Using the resource on a sustained basis for the long term benefits of the nation as a whole is the key issue This question of sustainability causes a great challenge to the responsible authorities and as we h
eard yesterday from the <O/> desk officer the department of wildlife is in the process of strengthening its planning and assessment unit to facilitate allocation of sustainable quotas and to enhance more rational use of the resource Thank you
\par <$A> <#/>Thank you very much Mr Boshe uh Mr Boshe started by expressing his satisfaction on the presentations of his two predecessors and then he went out }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\v\fs24 
 to outline the value of wildlife He pointed out the economic values and he also did point out }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24 
 that there are other values of wildlife which cannot be quantified using money or the dollar and therefore when you value wildlife exclusively on the dollar you might be doing uh wildlife injustice and I think if I heard him properly he mentioned the con
s
ervation values of uh communities such as forestry say the Ngorongoro forest in conservation <./>wa of <-/>of water That water is being used by Mto wa Mbo Karatu and so on which are some of the main granaries of this area so he pointed that out and the ot
h
er thing which he did point out is okay the economic component of the value of wildlife the money is obtained it goes to treasury and Treasury disperses that money to the various authorities which need it The very person who is living with the wildlife an
d
 suffering from it doesn't get anything and he drew our attention to this afternoon's discussion of the local people benefiting from wildlife and uh he pointed out that currently there is no mechanism for transferring the benefits which are accrued from w
i
ldlife to the local people and indirectly he suggested that there should be a mechanism of ensuring that the money which is generated from wildlife does finally reach the gentleman in Masailand who suffers from wildlife and uh in conclusion he said that w
ildlife as a resource has a role to serve and uh the main issue is to what magnitude it is exploited and he emphasised the need for sustainable utilisation of the resource Thank you Mr Bosche May I now welcome Dr Kriske from the Seluu Conservation Project

\par <$E> <X_><#/>}{\b\v\fs24 <&/>non-African speaker <X/>
\par }{\v\fs24 <$A> <#/>Thank you very much Dr Kriske uh The points which he emphasised is }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24  that although Tanzania is a large country but every square of every part of Tanzania is needed by some person in this country a
nd uh <-/>and uh conservation is a form of land use and there are many forms of land use and in his opinion form of land use is laterally competing with other forms of land use and towards the end he said that there are two forms of land utilisation one i
n
 which the person uses the resource without investing something like the robber industry and the other one is uh sustainable utilisation Now having said that I would like now to call upon the floor to make their contributions and maybe ask questions Thank
 you very much

\par <$C> <#/>Thank you Edda <#/>Maybe one point which uh I would like <-/>like to say how }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 Tanzania has participated is that the Ministry of Labour and Youth Development in collaboration with the DDS programme uh we have an exchange programme whereby we do receive }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 DDS field workers from member countries in Africa and when
 they come here in Tanzania we post them into uh groups in rural areas where the young people are working together So these field workers are supposed to work with the youth groups in trying to raise their standard of living in the form of <-_organise><+_
o
rganising> some various projects uh related to agricultural <-_project><+_projects> uh animal husbandry and so on <#/>And these field workers are supposed to stay for two years working with the group whereby after two years they can either uh extend their
 <-/>their contract and stay for another two years or they can terminate and then go back and receive others And in this way actually we have seen quite a lot of the contribution made by this volunteer programme through the DDS programme
\par <$B> <#/>Thank you Mazuki before you leave the chair maybe you could tell us the full name of DDS
\par <$C> <#/>Uh DDS uh in full name means Domestic Development Service uh which really connotes that uh the volunteers have got to work at the grassroot level giving service to the communities at the village level
\par <$B> <#/>Thank you Mr Mazuki <#/>Uh Mr Bwatei said that the day was inaugurated in nineteen eighty-five but it was not until nineteen eighty-eight that it <./>wa was celebrated in a big way in Tanzania <#/>Now non-governmen
tal organisations being what they are in working with the grassroot level men and women uh would you think Mr Halid Mika there is a way that we could involve the rural women and men and perhaps even the youth to participate in volunteering services
\par <$D> <#/>Yeah uh thank you Edda <#/>I think I've something to add more }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  about the IVD itself As far as I know that it creates the <-/>the awareness to the people }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 uh so that they could understand well the importance of the IVD uh also to understand what are the objects <./>o objectives of IVD uh in }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 case of Tanzania and uh thirdly to understand how the people are they going to be involved }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  in the voluntary services and whom are they <./>expect uh expected to volunteer <#/>To my opinion }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24 
 uh awareness uh should accompany with }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24  the importance of using uh mass media uh both in printing and the electronic mass media is important too in helping to draw the awareness of the people to understand what is the IVD <#
/>This can be implemented by arranging features articles interviews in radio services as we are doing now uh in TV programmes distribution of handouts and leaflets as well as uh erecting posters educating the people to understand what IVD is and what are 
t
hey supposed to do <#/>Therefore uh proper communication between mass media and uh national committee need to <-/>to be maintained <#/>Uh maybe even to <-/>to co-opt one member from mass media to the IVD national committee <#/>Secondly IVD <-_help><+_help
s> also to <-/>to stimulate the people to involve uh <-/themself> themselves in voluntary work <#/>Such this day }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 can bring together different categories of people as you asked me that women involving women and youth uh to <-/>to engage in volunt
ary work service such as environmental uh cleaning especially in the urban areas uh tree planting in <-/deforestated> areas <#/>In another way the IVD <-_help><+_helps> to <-/>to <-/>to mobilise the people in self-reliance activities <#/>Uh this will be d
i
scussed later I think so with my colleagues here <#/>But what I want to say here is IVD has helped to maintain the spirit of volunteerism in the country <#/>For example in Dar es Salaam alone uh the CCN youth organisation <?/>VIJANA uh have come up with t
heir traditional style that every month they mobilize themselves and uh take part in }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 city cleaning campaign which was launched by themselves last year <#/>This is an example which <-_show><+_shows> that youth are in the forefront taking part on }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24 
 volunteer work without waiting until the IVD celebrations <#/>So you see uh they have already been stimulated and they <-/>they are continuing these such this spirit }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  of volunteering
\par <$B> <#/>Thank you uh <#/>In as far as uh your explan
ation goes you talk about mass media and you mentioned some of the conventional media <#/>But maybe we should draw some experience from our colleague here Mr Bwatei as to how other forms of media have been used successfully to arouse interest and awarenes
s amongst grassroot uh level people
\par <$A> <#/>Well for specifically here in Tanzania what we've been doing for the past two years or so is that as far as media is concerned we begin with the press release which is usually published a day before the media eve
nt itself <#/>That is the day before fifth December and then on the fifth of December itself we come out with a feature article a big article supported with uh one or two pictures really field level activity and we have tried also to get radio discussion 
for }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\fs24  what we are doing now which last year for one reason or the other it could not come on <#/>But I\rquote m extremely happy that this year we\rquote 
ve been able to come out with this radio discussion <#/>So we believe many people will get to know about the IV
D either through the newspaper or through this radio discussion <#/>And of course this will be supported by some other field activities which will be undertaken which we have planned <#/>And the publicity aspect of these activities will also help a lot of
 
people you know to understand and even just get to know that there is a day called IVD and to us this is very significant <#/>If I may add experience has shown that any time we celebrate the IVD many many Tanzanians flood the office of UNDP trying to offe
r
 their services as volunteers in some other countries <#/>And we try to recruit people of all professions accountants doctors nurses uh economists metalworkers woodworkers and so on <#/>And to me it is significant because by then we try to promote that pu
blic awareness to see what Tanzanians could also contribute by way of volunteerism
\par <$B> <#/>Anything to add Mr Mazuki
\par <$C> <#/>Maybe Edda what I need to add here is uh maybe the celebrations which took part last year that uh <#/>Actually what we did uh duri
ng the first week of December <#/>We organised quite a few programmes which were undertaken around Dar es Salaam <#/>For instance we had uh clean-up at the Magomeni market and also we had some clean-up for around Muhambili uh hospital and also we had some
 clean-up along the <-/>the shores <#/>And the climax of this celebration uh we had some seminar whereby some speeches were given and discussions which }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
 uh all the volunteers in Tanzania from all over the <-/>the country came to Dar es Salaam and
 discussed the importance of this uh International Volunteer Day <#/>And right now what we are planning to do is that maybe instead of organising these celebrations in Dar es Salaam we are planning to decentralize so that within the regions they can organ
ise themselves and plan what activities can be undertaken through uh the Volunteer Day <#/>And I think this is what we planning in the future uh to do
\par <$B> <#/>Thank you Mr Mazuki uh <#/>Halid what do you think non-governmental organisations could do to make this spirit of volunteerism linger on throughout the year and not remain just as a day of the fifth of December from uh one year to another
\par <$D> <#/>Briefly I could say that we <./>we have an action programme of which }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24  we are going to involve all uh NGOs in the country so that they could do take part }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
\par <$B> <#/>Thank you Mika <#/>Uh Mr Bwatei is there a way that UA uh UNDP will make a follow-up of all the projects and plans that will have been uh drafted so that they are ongoing from 
year to year and also to keep the interest of those who like volunteering to go on and on }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\fs24 
\par <$A> <#/>Okay well uh UNDP has some contribution to make but then I would like to take the opportunity to correct <-_some><+_the> impression that the day 
or the IVD is not for UNDP <#/>It is a day set aside for all volunteers both international and national <#/>Of course UNDP comes in as a catalyst you know to set certain things in motion <#/>But here in Tanzania the national focal point for IVD celebratio
n is the Ministry of Labour and Youth uh <-/>Youth Development \lquote 
cause now they are working hand in hand with the with TANGO so very soon TANGO will also be taking an active role in the celebration <#/>The reason why UNDP does not want to give that impressio
n is that people would begin to say that Oh the day is for UN you know which is not the case <#/>It is for the Boy Scouts the Red Cross the Girl Guides YMCA and what have you <#/>It so it also includes the bilateral volunteers like the US Peace Corps the 
G
erman volunteers the Swedish volunteers the Finnish and so on <#/>So that has a global perspective and that is why UNDP plays a role but the day itself is not for UNDP <#/>But as you mentioned we try to work in conjunction with the ministry and with all t
he parties <#/>You know it\rquote s a united effort <#/>It\rquote s a united effort so that by that we could sustain the spirit of volunteerism in all <-_aspect><+_aspects> of our development
\par <$B> <#/><-/>Mhm Perhaps an argument would come about like in the case of Tanzania where there is }{\b\v\fs24 <+_article>}{\fs24 
 development levy out of every Tanzanian be he a worker or peasant <#/>And there <-/>there is this spirit of volunteerism then someone could say what is my money doing if there are youth every fifth of December coming to clean
 up the uh <./>the streets or the hospitals or whatever uh <#/>Can you give an explanation to this uh argument Mr Mazuki
\par <$C> <#/>Thank you Edda <#/>I think what we need to draw here is the meaning of volunteerism <#/>I think this is uh very important <#/>
It is important in the sense that uh development is actually brought about by the people themselves and that is when uh people understand I think what is now required is to raise the awareness <#/>I think that uh Mr 
\par <$A> <#/>Halid
\par <$C> <#/>Halid had alrea
dy mentioned about raising the awareness that if people understand that development comes by themselves that they need to contribute they need to put in effort <#/>Then when people pay development levy is to me what I understand is just a token because fo
r instance if you take the amount which is paid as development levy it\rquote 
s really very little if you can put it or you translate it in the form of the kind of uh work which it can produce <#/>But if people understand that on top of the development levy still 
they are required to commit themselves to such activities which can bring about social and economic development that\rquote s where voluntarism comes in <#/>That here is someone who understand that it is my <./>refson responsibility and it\rquote 
s my call it\rquote s my commitment to put my service to the development of the <-/>the country to the development of the society
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24 I think this is very important and I can add what Eric said that uh what we are doing is for instance in the programme of DDS that after the DDS field worke
rs have completed their contract what we expect that the groups after they have learned what uh when they were working with the DDS field workers then they should continue uh developing their programmes which they were involved with the DDS Field Workers 
That\rquote 
s when we can sustain this spirit of voluntarism we can sustain this spirit of giving service for the development of the welfare of everybody in the country I think this is very important uh All people should understand That's when we can maintain this
 spirit of voluntarism Thank you Edda
\par <$B> <#/>Uh okay now uh it did come out very well here that the major beneficiaries of the IVD that is the International Volunteer Day celebrations in Tanzania have been people mainly from Dar es Salaam uh How do we co
rrect this in future and uh by this I mean what practical strategies are you going to employ to make sure that the goal is reached that is bringing this volunteerism spirit down to the grassroot level people
\par <$A> <#/>Yeah it is true that uh in the past IVD
 celebrations have been confined to the national capital i e Dar es Salaam which is really not good enough So because of this we have taken steps to correct the anomaly So for the first time this year we are going to have regional celebrations We were not
 able to cover all the regions but we've been able to cover regions Dodoma Iringa Shinyanga and uh 
\par <$?> Singida
\par <$A> <#/>Singida The reason why this was possible is that uh we've been able to make use of the DDS field workers who are assigned to these regi
ons so they are going to be the animators for their respective regions They are going to mobilize all the volunteers in that particular region and celebrate the occasion in any way they would think feasible So they are going to liaise with other bilateral
 
volunteers like the Peace Corps the VSO and so on and also make use of the national NGOs the Boy Scouts YMCA and so on so that they can also embark upon some field activities in their respective regions And this is I <-/>I think or I believe one major act
ivity that we are really undertaking And as the years go by we intend to spread it over to cover if not all the regions at least as many as possible And really we are working towards that
\par <$B> <#/><ea/>Ndugu Mika
\par <$D> <#/>To allow <-_>to allow<-/> IVD be marked }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24  on rotation basis we'll also make regions to }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24  uh compete <-_>to compete<-/> }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>prep}{\v\fs24 
 each other uh In one region for example if one region has been earmarked to be the host for IVD I'm optimistic that it would try <-/>at <./>it 
at its best level to show how IVD has been welcomed by the community of that particular region So they will <-_>they will<-/> mobilize uh whatever is there just to show how voluntarism is taking part in that region uh To <-/>to conclude I said with my <-_
>
with my<-/> argument that uh we needed to <-/>to revive the <-/>the <-/>the rotation of uh IVD uh Let me also talk on <-/>on TANGO position As far as I know in many countries such as Bangladesh and <-/>and <name/> IVD is organised by respective NGOs as I 
s
aid earlier Now for the <-_>for the<-/> case of Tanzania this time the <-/>the government through the Minister of Labour and the Youth Development has decided that TANGO should take the <-/>the floor in collaboration with the National IVD Committee uh We 
are grateful to the government decision }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24  in respect to that }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24  TANGO is a unifying umbrella organisation of all local NGOs in grassroots uh Maybe uh let me explain that uh one of TANGO
\rquote s objectives is to <-/>to influence the policy that impact }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24  the <-/>the people\rquote 
s participation and uh sustainable development though strong NGOs involvement in the planning and the policy making process Therefore whatever the case is TANGO is represented at uh <-/>at all levels in the country uh 
through its members I mean local NGOs and the grassroots in the regions So I think if IVD committees are set up at regional district and village level a local NGO or grassroot uh can be invited and incorporated with the <-_>with the<-/> <./>com committee 
r
esponsible What TANGO can do is to identify those <./>NGO NGOs or grassroots to participate in that and in fact to take the lead in making IVD successful at <-/>at that <./>pat particular area Maybe the question will be on <./>h how to organise IV the IVD
 itself uh how to get <-_fund><+_funds/funding> etcetera I think this will also be discussing by my <-/>my <-/>my colleagues }{\b\v\fs24 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24 
\par <$B> <#/>Thank you Mika for giving TANGO\rquote s position As you heard from Mika TANGO is the umbrella organisation of the local NGOs and grassroot level organisations
\par Uh Mr Mazuki have you something to add in that direction
\par <$C> <#/>Maybe
\par <$B> <#/>Yeah okay Mr Bwatei
\par <$A> <#/>What I will add is that uh I <-/>I believe that at least most of the regions should be given the opportu
nity to celebrate the occasion By then there could be a major activity which you could decide which particular region is going to do the major activity You know as I said earlier on in the past everything had been concentrated in Dar es Salaam So just con
s
idering the logistic problems we may still have to think and come to the conclusion that this year the major activity would take place in Dodoma or in Shinyanga or somewhere By then the regions or even the districts could also have their own uh limited ac
t
ivity and the major activity perhaps will involve maybe the ministers or the even possibly the Prime Minister and the UNDP residential representative and uh maybe the donor uh representatives and so on So that it is going to be a big occasion just to crow
n all the activities to crown all the activities And to me this is the way that I envisage that the celebration is going to be despite the fact that it has its own logistics problems I think something like that could really be done

\par }{\fs24\lang2057 <I> <$A> <#/>Nizar Visram Institute of Finance Management Lecturer in Development Studies had this question 
\par <$B> <#/>Uh I was uh a bit surprised when uh <-_sometimes><+_some time> back your chairman Yasser Arafat announced that uh you Palestinians now recognise Israel 
\par <$C> <#/><-/>mhm
\par <$B> <#/>And I was even <-/>even more surprised that uh Yasser Arafat even said that uh the Palestinians are suspending arms struggle that the arms struggle now is <foreign/>kaduuk is finished <#/>Maybe you hoped <-_>maybe you hoped<
-/> that by doing that you are really you know uh you wanted support from America maybe America would support the International Peace Conference <#/>Maybe Israel also would be prepared to sit at the table and talk to PLO about peace <#/>But that didn't ha
ppen
\par <$C> <#/><-/>mhm
\par <$B> <#/>So far after all that time has gone after you recognised PL uh Israel <O/> suspended arms to America has not really recognized PLO and they are not prepared to talk to PLO <#/>Neither is Israel <#/>What do you think has been a
chieved by the overtures of the PLO <#/>And if you think that it has failed if it was a wrong step that you took now what are you intending to do after that 
\par <$C> <#/>Yah 
\par <$B> <#/>About that <#/>Thank you 
\par <$C> <#/>Thank you very much brother <#/>Actually
 this is a very tough question <#/>We ourselves Palestinians are trying to uh to answer it by our own our way <#/>Why <#/>Because as you said exactly we were or some of us or even in the Arab countries some of the Arab regimes are sometimes were telling u
s
 that well because of your policy because you want to liberate all Palestine and this is not realistic <#/>Our friends even in Soviet Union they say well this is not the policy <#/>You should be uh you know seeing the facts <#/>There is a new generation n
ow in Israel <#/>And it is a de facto country since forty-five years }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 <#/>And the old policies are not serving <#/>Actually our policies are very clear right from the very beginning <#/>Nineteen sixty eight is the date when we decided to build a 
secular democratic state of Palestine <#/>What do we mean by that <#/>Both Jews Moslems Christians regardless of religion would establish }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 and there is enough room for everybody <#/>The Israelis consider this policy as very destructive to Israel
 <#/>In nineteen seventy-four we had endorsed in our resolution of the PNC to have two states <#/>And to have our independent state over any territory which is going to be released by Israel after the convening of the International Peace Conference which 
was supposed to be held in nineteen seventy-four by the way <#/>And still it's not convened <#/>So regarding our policy it came <-_>it came<-/> up to the corner }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>idiom}{\fs24\lang2057 
 <#/>What we had been asked for had been fulfilled from our part <#/>And we are doing i
t really not because we want to satisfy the international public opinion <#/>No because we like really to achieve peace <#/>We are people who are striving for peace <#/>Don't think that war is <-/>is a good thing <#/>I mean to <-/>to be in war it means to
 die <#/>And I don't think that there is something valuable than }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  the life itself <#/>How about the life of the people themselves and their destiny <#/>How much you can live }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar
}{\fs24\lang2057  without knowing where to build a house and settle <#/>This i
s the tragedy of the Palestinian people <#/>It is not the matter of food and <-/>and <-/>and <-/>and uh and to survive only <#/>There is what is called belonging <#/>Where you belong to }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
 <#/>And each time when you go and write an <-/>an an any pass
port card all the time it is difficult for the Palestinian to say where is his residence <#/>Sometimes I write Tanzania <#/>Sometimes I don't know I write although I have a place where I belong to }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
 I want to be back to it <#/>Even if I don't go and
 reside there <#/>But still I belong to that place <#/>So you see because of this dream we are giving so much time for the peace <#/>So much room for the peace <#/>But at the same time we are not dreaming because we know the enemy what's also doing <#/>Ma
y
be it is undiscovered for the international public opinion <#/>But those Palestinians who are there whom you have seen now in the video they know exactly what is Israel and what Israel is planning for them Israel is planning to replace them all by the new
 
Jews coming from abroad <#/>They know it <#/>This is why they are resisting on the struggle <#/>But the struggle is not only armed <#/>What do you call these stones <#/>Isn't it an armed struggle <#/>Or it should be only with guns <#/>This is only a means
 
<#/>This is an armed struggle when you have the kid the woman and everybody is involved <#/>Do you want a struggle which is much better than this one a peaceful one very innocent one which <O/> enough to be <O/>with terrorism <#/>This is the terrorism the
 
organised terrorism which <-_use><+_uses> all means of terrorism <#/>The well organised terrorism which is backed by a well organised state called the United States <#/>So we have to struggle in both politics diplomacy and also in the land <#/>This is exa
c
tly what we are doing and we don't have any dreams and we know that this conflict is going to be resolved in our right but it needs a lot of factors also to play its role <#/>The regional role is not playing yet <#/>It has its own difficulties economic di
f
ficulties <#/>There are so many shortages around us and our <-/>our brothers <#/>So many conflicts here and there also are disabling the balance of forces in the area which is not bringing peace <#/>But from our part I think our duty is to continue and no
t
 to wait for these factors and we have to keep the blood bleeding all the time so that the issue would remain alive in the minds and in the hearts of our Arab nation as well as around the world as a whole <#/>I think it is an international commitment and 
i
t is an international responsibility after all <#/>Those who had voted to create such a state have now to check what kind of resolution they had adopted in nineteen forty <./>se seven <#/>They aimed to secure a little bit of Jews who had been I mean succe
e
ded to survive from the <-_>from the<-/> Second World War but the cost was another trouble for an all entire people and <-/uninstability> in an area which is very rich of interest for everybody <#/>They have now to check and see whether this is just or no
t
 and they have also to play their role <#/>I think it is not only our duty as the Palestinian people <#/>It is a duty of so many forces around the world <#/>And it is an international uh uh uh responsibility after all <#/>So we are going to continue my br
other
\par <$B> <#/>In your response to my earlier question you said that the United Nations headquarters has got copies of the nineteen forty-seven agreement 
\par <$C> <#/>yah
\par <$B> <#/>which demarcated how the Palestine state should be and what borders the state sh
ould have I have two questions <#/>One How do the western countries like <-/>like or the United States you know Britain and France how do they want to solve the <-/>the Palestinian problem Will they have a plan of solving the <-/>the problem because I hav
e
 not heard <-/>heard about it I know that there is they do send the foreign ministers to Damascus to Baghdad to other Arab countries to Cairo but I have not <-_>I have not<-/> seen a comprehensive plan for solving the Palestinian problem from the western 
p
oint of view <#/>Secondly the presence of the western troops in <-/>in the Middle East now is it so much to <-_>is it so much<-/> a question of oil or the interest for oil or <-/>or is there a plan to say to <-/>to dislodge the Palestinian problem from wo
rld prominence 
\par <$C> <#/>Uh I have the opinion that the opinion inside the West generally what is called the West had developed rapidly <#/>It is true that uh since nineteen forty-eight the positions in so many western countries European United States and s
o on <-_was><+_were> uh let's say uh very <?/>alignated with Israel stands where there is no Palestinian state uh where I do not know what I mean so many approaches which do not meet even with a minimum of the Palestinian rights <#/>But now it is not so <
#
/>This had developed and I have to tell you frankly as you can see I mean the whole European community almost all are recognising the rights of self-determination of the Palestinian people <#/>This had been declared in Venice in Madrid France almost all E
u
ropean I mean and even from the Parliament and on the official level I should tell you although we are not recognised in so many European states as embassies but de facto we are embassies there and they deal with us so uh <#/>Well in some of these countri
e
s especially the Mediterranean ones say the I mean the French position the Italian position the Greek position as well as the Spanish <#/>Go to Scandinavia where the Swedish position is so much advancing the Austrian one <#/>I don't want to name the whole
 
list but I can tell you that these positions are so much clearer nowadays <#/>And they are in support for a resolution of the conflict on the basis of realising our national rights and mainly the right for self-determination which could lead to an indepen
d
ent state as a matter of fact <#/>And they recognise also PLO as the sole legitimate representative of our people which means that it is a full party <#/>Now who is left as a matter of fact if we have to be sincere to the truth it is the American position
 
which is still delaying the train to move to its station <#/>Because as you have seen also the idea and the resolution to convene the International Peace Conference had been agreed upon almost from all countries around the world <#/>The United States also
 
had shown some interest in the idea <#/>But they have different approaches actually towards solution of regional conflicts <#/>That you know yourself <#/>That they want to be the god-father of any solution themselves not the international legality <#/>So 
this is the way they had done it in various regions and they want to be the sponsor for the peace as if that }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057 
 the peace has got a father <#/>The father of peace should be the United Nation which everybody now wants it }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\fs24\lang2057  to play its role
 <#/>But when it goes to the Palestinian problem the United States no <#/>They don't want to involve the United Nations <#/>They veto a resolution to send a fact-finding mission on behalf of the Security Council while they can get thin resolutions from th
e
 Security Council in one month <#/>So they are very selective in using the international legality because they want also their interests to be served by themselves <#/>And I tell you the oil the barrel of <./>oi of oil which they like now to sit on later 
i
f they succeeded to do so they are going to bargain both Japan the European Community and so many powers how much they should pay for that barrel <#/>This is why they don't like to involve the United Nation that much in our issue because also they want to
 
have a different approach in solving these issues the way it goes in their interest not the ways where the just lies <#/>This is why we are pushing to that direction <#/>We don't say that we want peace which could be done by the United States <#/>No <#/>W
e stress upon}{\b\fs24\lang2057  }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\fs24\lang2057 
 the need to have the security council members along with all parties <./>incl including the PLO because we are a full party where the United Nation is the sponsor <#/>Not the United States is the sponsor <#/>This is how we see the app
roach towards a solution of our uh issue <#/>That is what the Americans do not like to see <#/>They had proposed the self-rule and sometimes they talk about well <#/>Baker should come and see what are the possibilities <#/>Schulz should do so and so and t
he and sometimes they had even within the opening of dialogue with the PLO
\par <X_>}{\v\fs24\lang2057 The role they had played is just the voice of Israel I mean even in the few meetings which took place in Tunis with the American ambassador there was all the time what the Israeli sa
ys not what he thinks So they are a defender even in the term of dialogue So they are not neutral in this issue So they cannot be really the <./>fath godfather of the peace in <-/>in solving our issue But we are working hard to bring them to this neutral 
p
osition And I think there are different approaches to persuade <./y> <-_>to persuade<-/> them And also the whole Arab countries are asking also for the convening of this International Peace Conference And I think if we push towards this and press more we 
c
an succeed And you see I mean what happened in South Africa Great Nelson Mandela had succeeded on behalf of the people of South Africa to be respected there in the White House and to be received by Mrs Thatcher who is now no more Prime Minister So this is
 
how the struggle is going to continue And sooner or later the United States would find itself that it should listen and listen carefully because we in the Arab area It's not a simple area This is a trap This is a trap and if the <*/war> were disturbed I'm
 
afraid that they will not be able to come out from there safely at all They will not face only Iraq but they will face a very complicated situation around There is <-/injust><+_injustice> in the area There are the poor and the rich There <-_><+_is> the Mi
ddle East issue which is bleeding }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 since more than forty years and all this file if it is going to be opened by war it is not going to be closed easily by the United States This is why the choice of war should not be invited at all It's very dang
erous for everybody including the United States itself 
\par <$D> <#/>My name is <*/Meka> Maybe I'm far away from my colleagues here uh regarding to }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\v\fs24\lang2057  my question uh My question is that you the Palestinians have formed their state and now we the Palestin
ian Chief Mr Yasser Arafat is being referred }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>prep}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 as the Head of State And also there was a question of forming the governing the government in exile Uh now where is this government Has it been formed or not And if not why Because now as far as I know 
that this is a part of an executive arm which will be looking for the interests of the Palestinians 
\par <$?> Yah 
\par <$D> <#/>For example the <-/>the NPC which is existing It has been formed in exile and it has been meeting for several times to talk issues regar
ding the Palestinians themselves So where is this the government of in <-/>in exile Has it been formed or not If not why I'm very interested to know about this the <-/>the <-/>the existence of the government in exile 
\par <$C> <#/>Thank you very much for the q
uestion As a matter of fact this is so much procedural question I mean because the <-/>the formation of the government or not formation of the government is not really the issue I mean the PLO with its executive committee is playing the role of the govern
m
ent This is not only practical one but even a legislative one because they had been assigned from the PNC to act as a government in exile To act not to be a government Because even from our experience through the so many experiences in the past in history
 
you can form the government in exile if you are just in the transitional period to go and direct to <-/>to your state directly Now even this prospect is not seen practically seen So now to call it a government in exile or to call it the executive committe
e
 of the PLO What's important is to do this the role of being responsible towards the people And this is exactly what the PLO is doing since nineteen sixty-four And I want to tell you something maybe it could be <./>inform informative for some people who d
o
 not know it That the PLO executive committee is actually a government when we have got a Ministry of Education which involve six universities only inside the occupied territories and more than one thirty thousand university standard students abroad We ha
v
e a Ministry of Health which runs something like more than twenty hospitals and more than one hundred clinics around the world not only inside Palestine We have the Ministry of Social Affairs which takes and looks after more than seventy thousand families
 
of <?/>martyrs and other social services We have a department or political department which is now running more than one oh five embassies or PLO representatives offices which is more than really the capacity of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a matter
 
of fact And we have various departments which actually act as ministries of our government But to call it government or not to call it government I think this has something to do with the timing when to do it We will not do it unless we are sure that the 
day next we are going these government offices are going to be in Jerusalem But the executive committee is doing actually the role of this government }{\b\v\fs24\lang2057 <&/>grammar}{\v\fs24\lang2057 
 since quite long time ago not now But the official actually uh resolution that we had taken in 
the PNC in its last meeting which had declared and proclaimed the uh state of uh Palestine as independent state had mandated the executive committee of the PLO to act as the government of Palestine So officially they are called ministers and the Head of S
t
ate Mr Arafat is received and dealt with even on protocol from almost all countries who recognise us as he is really the President And he is as a matter of fact because the PLO is doing the <-/>the <-/>the role of the government of all Palestinian people 
p
ractically But I mean when to do it or not I think this is left for the central council of the PLO to check when the suitable time to do it And this has something to do with the prospects of the peaceful solution and the prospects to realise the independe
nt state It has nothing to do with the performance of the PLO
\par <$D> <#/>Do you think you will be able to accommodate all refugees living in exile in a new state if you succeed in your struggle 
\par <$C> <#/>Yes this is also a practical question not a political o
ne I mean uh uh the politics is that we want the state whether it's going to accommodate us all or whether not But I can tell you some examples A country like Singapore has got a lot of population and they are doing very good in the term of economy I mean
 
this is not uh I mean an argument for those who are putting this question to <-/unjustify> our proclamation of the independence You are not of course uh But telling you practically we are in an era and in a period where the borders usually haven't got tha
t
 big meaning See Europe for example you don't feel any kind of borders when you cross from Holland to Belgium to Luxembourg even to France So borders are meaningless when we talk about moving of <-/personnels> ideas economy And if our independent state of
 
course it is going to be realised very soon I can tell you this is not going to be a real problem because in <-/>in the Middle East the peace of the zone of peace we are going to complete each other rather in the area The Palestines are doing already well
 
in the term of the development of the area and they will remain also so and they are apart from their Arab nation But this should not mean to prevent them of having their own state We are refugees We are lacking the identity and belonging not practically 
w
hat we are going to do Practically we are going to invest as much as possible in this independent state And when we go to the tables to negotiate these practical issues I don't think that this is going to be a real problem for the refugees what to do and 
w
here to go especially if we are talking about real peace in the Middle East all these practical questions are going to be resolved practically And then it is going to be a matter of economy and it is the people who are going to decide whether it is going 
f
or them okay to go back or not I mean it is the chance which is going to decide where to settle where to invest and where to work Now you can find so many Tanzanians who are not living in Tanzania But still they are Tanzanians and they should be Tanzanian
s
 wherever they could stay And you could find uh uh uh so many people who are going according to their own business I mean to say the right for return is to be guaranteed for all Palestinians because they belong to Palestine and the principle of the state 
a
nd we will not argue too much about the borders because it is already endorsed within the United Nation and there are enough maps to see where it is exactly And then it is going to be our headache how we are going to manage ourselves within this and to ac
commodate ourselves within this area Along with the co-operation with all the states around especially if they are going to live in the peace and co-operation and they have to develop themselves I don't think that this is going to be a real problem
