<$A> Welcome to Breastfeeding Corner In today's edition of the programme we are going to discuss the support that the breastfeeding mothers expect from the community Welcome Breast milk is the ideal food for the baby Its composition meets all the baby's nutritional needs and helps to protect him or her against many of the infections common in infancy No other food can do this For the mother to breastfeed successively she should be given moral support by all those close to her This includes the relatives neighbours and friends Mrs Betty Mturi from the Breastfeeding Information Group.
<$B> She needs somebody to help her to support her to tell her how <-/>how nice she is to have had this baby The husband should be able to come a bit earlier from <-/>from work if he can to come and give this mother a little bit of support Maybe sometimes she needs something from kiosk she needs milk she needs maybe food and she has been all alone whole day when the husband was away at work I emphasise here in Nairobi where we stay in the city uh mother-in-law is at home your sisters are at home in <O/> Maybe the husband's <-_sister><+_sisters> are also in <O/> and it happens that it's only the <-/>the mother and <-/>and the father who are living in Nairobi And it becomes a bit difficult when the mother has just delivered and she's alone in the house She feels she's left alone to cope with everything and <-_sometime><+_sometimes> it becomes too difficult for the mother She's overloaded She has a baby to breastfeed a baby who is crying all the time and the baby who is supposed to be demand-fed as we said earlier The baby should be fed as the baby cries When the baby needs the mother the milk is already ready in the breast the baby should be just put there to breastfeed And for this reason that the baby is demand-fed the mother is quite busy She will have no time to <-/>to go in the kiosk to buy some milk or to buy some food As you know in Nairobi you have to buy everything She has nobody to leave the baby She can't move around so sometimes she becomes a little bit upset We should be with our mothers after delivery to support them to be with her let her know that she has done good job to have delivered this baby Fathers sometimes feel a little bit of jealousy when the mother is just looking after the baby She the father <-_want><+_wants> <-/>want a lot of attention and the father thinks now the attention has been now drawn from him to the baby fully and I want to emphasise to fathers that this baby it's you It's your baby so it's you When the mother is loving this baby the mother is loving you as well It's your baby so you should not feel that the mother is only attending to the baby and she has forgotten uh to attend to you What you should do is to support her try to be with her try to show her that what she's doing is very noble Let her breastfeed this baby Buy her things if you are you've found she's in the house with nothing You go for shopping Bring her what she needs and be with near her Hold this baby for her for a while you know Smile to the baby Talk to the baby They always say A new-born baby is a human being If he hears a voice of a person she or he will never forget that voice throughout his life and that's how kids know their father by the voice and their mother by the voice the way they speak If you don't speak to this baby there is no way this baby will know who you are The baby will learn to know the father through the father talking to the baby And it's always very good I want also to emphasise to our <-/>our dear fathers that the mother needs to be really comfortable If this mother is a little bit upset the as I said the milk will just dry up You know mothers people have forgotten mothers are also they're mammals they're like a cow If you use that milking a cow and you come with a stick you slap the cow from the back the cow will not produce any milk It's exactly the same with mothers If the father comes so much annoyed start quarrelling the mother <-_start><+_starts> making her upset the milk will just disappear It will dry up She'll have no milk And this is the trend we have had with many <-/>many people who have not known the management of breastfeeding that the father comes or somebody else comes and starts upsetting this mother Maybe she's had a baby girl and somebody wanted a baby boy You know a baby is a baby and somebody comes and <-_start><+_starts> comment that uh you had another you had another girl oh it's a baby girl you know the mother becomes upset and immediately the mother is disturbed the milk just disappears So we beg you friends father anybody who is a friend to this mother immediately she has a baby please support her try to be friendly to her You can see some mothers after delivery they become easily upset You have seen mothers who <-/>who start crying and they cry <-_>they cry<-/> a lot they cry <-_>they cry<-/> You don't know why they are crying Because the hormones after delivery <-_becomes><+_become> a little bit disturbed and she needs this support When you see her crying don't think that uh now what's wrong with her she has become a nut No This is just normal It's completely normal Let her cry off and then she'll be happy that you just pass over It is just for a period then it should disappear What she needs is support from <-/>from her husband A husband who dearly <-_love><+_loves> her is the only one who will have few words of loving to make her feel she's comfortable and she is cheered up 
<$A> So fathers you have heard all from Mrs Mturi The breastfeeding mother needs your support She needs your soothing words to breastfeed successfully Give her ideal food and encourage her to eat and take enough drinks.
<$B> The mother should drink <-/>drink porridge We have millet We have uh sorghum We have our own local food which is very good in producing uh milk If she drinks a lot of uh porridge uh which is made from uh millet <ea/>ujii they have said any mother who drinks <ea/>ujii of <O/> produce more milk It has something which increases the mother's uh lactation and the milk-production becomes more When this mother goes back maybe she's want to go somewhere uh to visit maybe to visit and she has to leave the baby let the mother know who to express this milk leave uh milk in the cup and somebody else you know help her to feed the baby by cup Because a mother has when they go back from their maternity leave you find out the first week the second week the milk <-_start><+_starts> drying up because they are not expressing as you a mother express the milk the more milk is made so you the mother should know how to express empty the breast so that lactation can continue even when she's away Breastfeed this baby What we say <-/>we <-/>say the mother should breastfeed the baby at least for two years Now that we know we can't manage to we <-/>we are now in family-planning We need to have few kids not the way people used to have We have the number of children you want you discuss with your husband This baby because you are not now intending to have more uh kids we have at least a few number of kids you are supposed to breastfeed this baby as much as you can Maybe you can go on for three years according to how you feel The more you breastfeed your child the more healthy a child you get and the more clever child you get Breast milk has got a component which helps to make uh a baby's uh brain grow properly to a human brain and make them even genius they have done research Breast milk is not only breast - it's only for food it's not only food alone it has a lot It's food and it has so many nutrients it has antibodies it has so many components So when the mother gives this breast milk to the baby she should know that she's doing a noble job to make a human being proper a human being who will live as a human being That's why you see the mothers who <-/>who don't have enough support the milk dries up very fast And then they start using other feed buying this uh milk from tinned milk And this formula as we know they are not supposed to be given to babies because it's not healthy to give them to children We should breastfeed because we don't know where this milk were you know made what it was made up of They have so many uh they have so many extras uh components which we don't understand give children a lot of skin diseases chest or chest diseases coughs and really we have seen that we made a mistake and we don't want to use these formulas anymore We rather use mother because mother is here and she has got easy food straight from mother to the baby and nice food is food and is all prepared by God What we should now do is to really know that breast milk is the best and we should do and encourage every mother after delivery to breastfeed the baby and feed the babies for at least two years if you can't imagine more But if you can continue the better for your child

<$A> When Wanajukwa Players made their debut in July with Abraham Hussein's play Mashetani at the French Cultural Centre I thought they had a long way to go and said as much The group displayed lack of finesse in the use of techniques such as mime and had plotted the movement rather poorly Three months later Wanajukwa have been on stage again this time with <O/> a translation of Wole Soyinka's The Trials of Brother Jero This play staged by Wanajukwa at the Kenya National Theatre last week where the group was officially launched is a satire on a Christian preacher Brother Jero Jero is the epitome of hypocrisy and symbolises all that is unchristian His greatest weakness is that every time he sees a woman he's simply overwhelmed It is not out of the way to imagine that he actually engages in some sexual activities that are against Christian ethics But Jero is also a <-/debter> who is not too keen on repaying what he owes others In fact in the play the wife of one of his flock <?/>Chume comes outside his house so that he can repay her In one of the most comical scenes we see Jero dashing out of a window to escape this woman All this time <?/>Chume has been asking Jero to let him beat up the wife But Jero has been dissuading him citing their Christianity as the reason but when the woman insists so much <-/>much on camping at Jero's the preacher willingly tells <?/>Chume to give her a thorough beating <?/>Chume does this but eventually realises that Jero gives the permission to get even with the stubborn woman rather than to gratify his follower In fact <?/>Chume is the one who gives us the hint that Jero might have been up to some tricks even with his wife <?/>Chume therefore becomes a symbol of ignorance and later one of enlightenment He's the blind <-/congregant> who so staunchly believes in his pastor that he loses his own independence Here's a character to be sympathised with rather than condemned Wanajukwa's presentation of <O/> was quite entertaining with the actors and actresses showing clear trace of differentiation This differentiation was particularly pointed in crowd-scenes where the congregation sings and dances such typical trouble-scenes where we usually see people behave the same way as if they were uniform Wanajukwa made a clear effort to have each character come out in his or her own way The best example of this was that of William Ugonde doing the part of a member of the congregation <ea/>Mzee Mgusi Ogonda was noticeable for his <-/caricatural> dance which reminded us of the various prayer rallies we see in estates and streets Pharoah Ochichi also came out very well as <?/>Chume the loyal follower as did Tingo Nyamatiko as Jero Perhaps one character which should have been given more punch was that of <?/>Chume's wife played by Anne Karuiki who was a bit too mild in the trouble-scenes But the most serious problems with the production concerned positioning of artists on stage In positioning characters it is necessary to be aware of what effect is needed We talk of positioning for establishing focal points and for creating dominating positions thus a character who is meant to stand out can be made to do so by being positioned separately from the others or in such a position that he appears to be in control of the others It is clear that Wanajukwa did not give much thought to this and therefore ended up with some rather clumsy positions Closely related to this is the problem of masking Masking simply refers to the problem of actors and actresses standing in the way of other characters This is something that must be avoided as much as possible unless the character being masked is technically out of action or if the masking is part of the action directed Otherwise masking reveals a lack of awareness among artists and denies the audience the benefit of observing all that goes on Wanajukwa is a group that is dedicated to the promotion of the national language Kiswahili Talking during the launch the group's chairman T Nyamatiko said that the group had decided to do Swahili because that is what they are most comfortable with Secondly he said that they had been criticised for targeting the school-audience where there is ready market But he observed that there was nothing wrong with that approach because after all the group has to establish a financial base for its take-off But much as Tingo was right it would be most absurd for Wanajukwa to only do school-plays and not venture out That would make it more like the University of Nairobi Chakina Group which has notoriously done the same plays over and over This kind of thing happening does no good to the artist By choosing to concentrate on Swahili plays Wanajukwa is taking on a very daunting task because the theatre world will want to look up the group for the writing and development of scripts in Swahili It will be the group's duty to seek out playwrights writing in Swahili if no member of the group is himself a playwright But another way in which Wanajukwa would be useful is to engage in the translation of theatre masterpieces into Swahili for Kenyan audiences When this happens then the group will surely be giving an invaluable service 
Ezekiel Olembi of Kenyata University tells Preview that plans for the National Young Playwrights' meeting are complete This meeting is to be held at Kenyatta University from October thirtieth to November second It will be officially opened by the Vice Chancellor of Kenyatta University Professor George Eshiwani who has kindly agreed to be the patron of the meeting Already this group have already selected the playwrights to attend this meeting The playwrights are as follows Amina Ali from Laikipia Campus Naivasha Sister Arbebinu from Thika Road Primary School Nairobi Ruben Alembi from Mukumo Boys High School Kayega Caroline Otieno from Kenyatta University Nairobi Mwaura Bantu from Kenyatta University Nairobi Matasio Kagua from Nairobi Wairimu Karani from Kenyatta University Nairobi David Karanja of University of Nairobi Victor Kazengwa from Chevakali Maragoli Okoth Kobonyo from Nairobi Philip Waweru Mbugu from Kenyatta University Maende from Egerton University Muchiri from Kenyatta University Joseph Nderi from Egerton University Betty Ndomo from Rageni Siaya L.K Njagi Ham Ngaruyia from Kenyatta University Nairobi Rita Nyamato from Loretto Convent Valley Road Morris Ombok from Our Lady of Visitation Church Nairobi Waimukoya Odanyiro from Laikipia Campus Naivasha Lucy Maguta from Kenyatta University and Olunga Wanjala from Lower Kabeth Campus Nairobi It is hoped that all these playwrights will receive their invitation letters in time to attend this particular meeting Arrangements have been made for different papers to be presented at this meeting The papers will be presented during the morning hours from nine to two p m when the sessions will be open to the public The papers lined up include The Development of Theatre in Kenya by Dr Kisa Amateshe of Kenyatta University Politics and the Playwright by Egara Kabaji The Critic and Kenyan Drama by Okengo Matiani The Language Question in Drama by Okumba Miruka Drama and Science Education by Dr Enubeyua and a forum session Why Theatre to be shared by Ruth Kamau and in which speakers will be Zen Oubeka Okumba Miruka Andrew Amutata Okengi Matiani and Sally Mwangola Meanwhile there are a number of things still happening in different places in the art of <?/>world and theatre The Soyinka play The Lion and the Jewel is continuing at Miujisa Players The play features Erastus Owuor as Chief Baroka and Caroline Ndungo as Sidi It is directed by Peter Ngunga Nelin and Hake Artists are opening with their play Born of a Lesser God at the Kenya National Theatre on Tuesday October twenty-second That is the same day when Friends Theatre directed by Jacob Otieno open with Bonde Swande's Flamingo at the French Cultural Centre to run till October twenty-fifth.

<$A> Our environment 
In this edition Shelter for sustainable development combating poverty and standards of living conditions while protecting the environment
UNCHS United Nation's Centre for Human Settlement Habitat is the United Nation's focal point for facilitating human settlement solutions as an integral component of sustainable development processes not only for individual countries but also the world community In this challenge the centre is particularly conscious of the <O/> to bring more direct benefits to the millions of inadequately sheltered and homeless people throughout the world In Nairobi Kenya UNCHS Habitat was established in nineteen seventy-eight by the United Nations General Assembly two years after Habitat United Nations' Conference on Human Settlements held in Vancouver Canada UNCHS Habitat was instrumental in growing up the global strategy for shelter for the year two thousand to co-ordinate global efforts to facilitate the provision of adequate shelter for all by the end of the century This strategy was formally adopted by the General Assembly in nineteen eighty-eight and now provides the focus for the centre's work The term sustainable development brings together two basic principles underpinning the management of human activities one concentrating on development goals the other on limiting the harmful impacts of human activities on natural environment The first the development component is about meeting the needs of the present generation The second the sustainable component is about human activity not compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs The film for this year's World Habitat Day Shelter for Sustainable Development has been chosen to highlight the central role that Shelter Delivery in the context of human settlement can play in <-/salvating> our planet's life support system and in meeting the needs for all The United Nations' Centre for Human settlement Habitat believes that the way to reconcile economic and ecological imperatives is through alleviating poverty in human settlements The creation of adequate and appropriate shelter for all can generate economic opportunity for vast numbers of the poor It can improve environmental conditions in rural and urban areas and it can act as a vehicle to harnessing active commitment of all people everywhere to the tasks of preventing careless waste of non-renewable resources for a sustainable future
<$A> How can we help to achieve shelter for sustainable development An environmentally friendly house should be situated in such a way that it uses the minimum amount of productive land and is constructed with materials that have no toxic effects and takes maximum advantage of the prevailing climate conditions for sunlight and ventilation thereby cutting down on the use of energy The household would energy-efficient appliances and be careful in their use of water If all this were done on the individual level the accumulative effect on the global environment would be tremendous Similarly our settlements will have to evolve in new environmentally conscious directions Recycling managing and disposing of waste materials in environmentally conscious ways that become a habit a social cultural attitude ingrained in our thinking.
<$A> Every year UNCHS Habitat celebrates World Habitat Day every first Monday of October During this day governments and non-governmental organisations throughout the world mark the day with different activities The Secretary General of the United Nations Dr Butros Butros Ghali issued a statement for the commemoration of the day In his statement he said 
<$B> I quote End of quote
<$A> On this World Habitat Day the Secretary General says we should recommit ourselves to build a world devoid of homelessness poverty and destitution a world in which all can share in the earth's resources and all have access to basic necessities such as food and shelter Only thus he says shall we have laid the proper moral economic and social foundation for sustainable development in the spirit of one earth and one humanity

<$A> Hello and welcome to this week's edition of road safety from KBC Nairobi Our guest is Chief Inspector David Kariuki of Traffic Nairobi uh Traffic Branch Nairobi Area He starts with last week's accident figures
<$B> Thank you Wanjira Kago and the following is the last week's accident figures In Coast Province six people died Twenty-six were seriously injured and twenty-five were slightly injured There occurred a total of forty-three accidents in Coast Province In Central Province eight people died Thirty-three were seriously injured and thirty-four were slightly injured There occurred a total of thirty-three accidents in Central Province In Eastern Province one person died Eight were seriously injured and three were slightly injured There occurred a total of ten accidents in Eastern Province In Njanga Province four people died Six were seriously injured and <./>s another six were slightly injured There occurred a total of fifteen accidents in Njanga Province In Western Province two people died Twelve were <./>ser were seriously injured and eight were slightly injured There occurred a total of fourteen accidents in Western Province In Rift Valley Province no one died but fifteen people were seriously injured and another six were slightly injured There occurred a total of twelve accidents in Rift Valley Province In Nairobi Province nine people died Twenty-two were seriously injured and eighty-three were slightly injured There occurred a <./>numb a total of eighty-three accidents in Nairobi Province In North-Eastern Province there was no accident at all and we commend the residents of the Province for uh maintaining uh safety on their roads In total uh thirty people died uh in the Republic One hundred and twenty-two were seriously injured and another one hundred and sixty-five were slightly injured And the total number of the uh of the accidents in Kenya was two hundred and ten Compared with the previous week we <-/>we see that there was a <./>de <-/>a decrease of thirteen people uh also died They decreased by thirteen because the previous week we had forty-three Those who were seriously injured increased by eleven because we had a hundred and eleven the previous week And those who were seriously uh slightly injured decreased by four because we had one hundred and sixty-nine compared to this uh to the previous uh last week's one sixty-five The total number of accidents in the Republic also increased by fifteen because uh the previous uh the last <-/>last week we had one hundred and ninety-five compared to last week's two hundred and ten
<$A> Now the number of people who died has come down by thirteen and that's a good sign and it looks like operation <?/>Usalama is effective Remember it's still on and you're being watched So be extremely careful when using the road The Nairobi International Show is back with us Time for Chief Inspector David Kariuki who tells me he will be commanding traffic in the Nairobi International Show to educate us more on what to do during the Show Chief Inspector Kariuki
<$B> Thank you uh I'll not actually be commanding the traffic but I'll be participating in the <-_>in the<-/> Show uh at Yamhuri Park and as you all know that all roads now lead to Yamhuri Park for the uh Nairobi International Show nineteen ninety-four uh the traffic policemen are going to be extremely very very busy uh all over the <-/>the place particularly in Nairobi and I'm sure even other adjacent <-_province><+_provinces> is like uh Eastern uh Rift Central where a lot of people will be coming to the Show uh <-_>to the Show<-/> to the Nairobi Show we will be quite busy and we expect a lot of vehicles to come from uh from outside Nairobi and the Nairobi City is going to be full of vehicles Uh in fact it's also going to be full of human traffic uh and this calls for uh an <./>exert <-/>an exerted effort and we are prepared for this and we anticipate that uh the Show will go well as the previous years
<$A> Now Chief Inspector Kariuki has just talked about up-country people who come to participate in the Show I'm just wondering how necessary it is for someone to drive <./>i with his own personal vehicle to come into Nairobi <./>whe when we already have problems with the traffic Is it necessary
<$B> Well uh it is <-_>it is<-/> necessary because not all people uh uh want to come to the Nairobi International Show in groups In fact we shall have groups coming to the Show We shall have individuals driving themselves into the Show or let's say into the City and this one is going to increase the number of vehicles that are usually in Nairobi and this is the time uh we actually ask people to be more uh to be extra careful uh not to <-/>to cause accidents uh We also urge other road users like uh the Public Service vehicles like the <ea/>matatus buses and uh other road users uh not to commit these petty offences like uh obstruction uh and these other uh offences like uh blocking the road uh because when you do that you cause a lot of jam because vehicles will have increased and as you go to the Show you have to obey the directives of the police <./>offi given by the police officers There're also signs placed on the roads leading to the showground and you have to obey There will be cars using stickers and policemen are all over uh to direct you uh If you are told please go and park to this parking place please obey because if you don't then you cause a jam uh As you all know you have seen Nairobi International Show has got I mean there're a lot of people vehicular <./>traff I mean vehicular traffic and human traffic is quite big and if you start arguing with a policeman that I want to park here I want to drop this one uh inside when you don't have the necessary sticker then you cause a lot of <-_problem><+_problems> and in fact uh you may even cause an accident because when you cause a long queue of vehicles following each other uh because of arguing with a policeman uh then this is just too bad and you may find yourself ending up being taken to a police station your vehicle being towed away because we do not want uh these people who come there to argue uh they want to park where they want They don't want to follow directives This is too bad There are stickers as I said there earlier and if you want them buy the uh <-_>buy the<-/> sticker for the parking that you want If you do not buy a sticker there're car uh public car parks where you go and pay and again we have the members' car park We have the trade car park We have <./>par uh uh uh free car park We have got uh uh parking places inside the showground that is uh D car park uh This is where people with the D uh <-/>D stickers stickers marked D are going to park and they're directed by the traffic policemen and those with the uh members' car <./>pa uh members' stickers will have to park at the members' car park and you have to be very very very careful because there is a lot of theft of motor vehicles If you park and you are given a receipt by the National Youth Service people make sure that you retain that receipt because if you lose <-_>if you lose<-/> that receipt when you come to take your vehicle you'll not be allowed to take the vehicle because you must produce that receipt that you got when you parked your vehicle Failure to do that it will force you to go home uh by other means to bring the log book and other necessary documents to prove that the car belongs to you
<$A> Now transport is in high demand during the Show Now two things happened to the Public Service Vehicles First they overload then they overcharge How are you going to curb this problem
<$B> Well as you know as you know Wanjira Kago when there is such a big thing uh such a big event uh going on in our country the traders uh tend to take or to hijack the members of the public and overcharge and also overload but uh we try to minimise this by placing our people uh on all routes but sometimes you may uh you may find that some of these things may go unnoticed because the policemen are far too much busy and we try to control traffic uh as much I mean uh uh as much as we can but then you find us that there is very little time left uh to check on these trivial offences or other traffic offences uh All we would like to ask the members of the public is try to <./>vi <-/>to avoid as much as possible do not to cause accidents Drive carefully uh and you <-_>you you<-/> be sure that you are <-_>you are<-/> on the right route where you want to go If you want to go to the showground particularly those people who come from the rural areas some of them do not know uh where to go or where to park please ask a policeman Ask any policeman who before you get to the showground so that you don't get confused when you get to the showground and then you start uh going round round and around and then perhaps you find that your fuel is running out and you may <./>s <-_>you may<-/> think that policemen are harassing you which is not the case They are just trying to uh be orderly or to park the vehicle in an orderly manner So please try and enquire before you get into the showground There are police There are policemen traffic policemen all the way through to the showground If you come from the Kabira side if you come from Gong side all the way through you'll <./>ha <-/>you'll find policemen uh uh all along the uh uh <-/>the route and you may stop and enquire from a policeman Now I have this type of a sticker where do I go Which route do I follow Enquire before you come to the showground because at the showground you'll find the area is congested with vehicles and human traffic and then you uh if you start roaming wondering about uh what to do Then you cause problems to other people because we want here vehicles to run smoothly to their respective parking places
<$A> Now there is also the issue of uh human traffic in the showground There are several people who work in groups and cause obstruction I would like you to give them a word of caution
<$B> Yes I would like to advise everyone The human traffic of anybody who will be in at the showground There're people who drive into the showground because they have the allowed and the <-/>the prescribed sticker Please drive carefully Do not run over people because people are too many and some of them are many of them are children Many of them are old people Many others are disabled and you should be extra careful and you who is in the showground walking uh you should be extra careful and watch and be careful See that see to it that you <-/>you do not obstruct the vehicles Walk I know people walk on the roads <./>in <./>in inside the showground but then you have to be very very careful and listen to any vehicle coming behind you or in front of you or in uh uh from the side so <-/>so that we <-/>we <-/>we see to it that no accident occurs and all of us are safe
<$A> And that's road safety for this week Our guest was Chief Inspector David Kariuki of Traffic Branch Nairobi Area Until next week this is Wanjira Kago

<$A> We present Kenyatta Day 
<$A> In this pre-Kenyatta Day programme briefly we look at what triggered Kenya's independence struggle European settlers started arriving in Kenya since eighteen ninety-six but in early nineteen hundred the settlers set a goal to establish in East Africa a new loyal white dominion securely in the principles of British tradition and western civilisation Later on a colonist association was formed by the settlers which pressurised the British government to introduce a legislative council They introduced a taxation so as to force Africans to work in their farms By nineteen twenties missionaries' activities especially education had produced some elite among the Africans who accepted European values and for some time acted as agents of western style civilisation But as from nineteen twenty-one they became the great critics of the colonisers and the western values In western Kenya the CMS Mission Station at Maseno produced the first group of African political leaders including the Reverend Simion Njende Reverend Ezeke Opende Ruben Omulo Jonathan Okwiri and Mathai Otieno among others In central Kenya also the first political leaders were mission boys Harry Thuku James Obuta Jesse Kariuki Joe Machuchu and Jomo Kenyatta This generation of educated Africans spearheaded the struggle for independence in Kenya But during the Second World War period all political associations were banned and several political leaders were detained at <O/> In nineteen forty-four an African was nominated to the legislative council to represent African interests Later Kenya African Union was founded and when Kenyatta came back from Britain he became its first president in nineteen forty-seven Kenya African Union demands became more and more radical They insisted on full political independence The Mau-Mau broke out in nineteen fifty-two leaving many Africans dead and others detained in hostile atmosphere All political parties were banned until nineteen sixty when the ban was lifted The main grievances by Africans which triggered the independence struggle included high taxes forced unpaid labour in position of registration ordinance the <ea/>Kiponde system loss of African land poor standards of education provided by missionaries and apartheid among others Eventually Kenyatta was released from detention in nineteen sixty-one and later nineteen sixty-three Kenya achieved independence On his release <ea/>Mzee Jomo Kenyatta was interviewed at a press conference at the Maralal detention camp.
<$B> With all sincerity I can assure you that in my disadvantaged position and as a restricted person I shall try my best to answer your questions in the best way I can I hope that one day I shall be able to meet you as a free man And I think this will not be very long I trust that in asking me your questions you'll bear in mind that for over eight years I have been bottled up in the <O/> away from public life and world affairs During that time I have been greatly misrepresented by some of you but today I hope that you will stick to the truth and that you refrain from writing sensational stories about me Ladies and gentlemen through the medium of your newspapers I want to take this opportunity to thank millions of men and women of various races and nations who have and still are fighting gallantly for my release as well as for the release of my comrades who are suffering greatly great hardships in various detention and restriction camps I wish also to thank my brothers and sisters who have kept up this

<$A> What was your weekend like I hope maybe you visited a theatre and watched a play maybe you went to a cinema hall and watched a movie and maybe you just decided to stay at home and listen to some music and maybe you watched uh an art exhibition somewhere in the city And I tell you welcome to this programme or this evening's edition of this program Preview a programme that gives you the <-/>the latest highlights in both uh performing and creative arts Hello and welcome Amongst what we've lined up for you tonight is the formal launching of <-_a><+_the> Wanija Players and also a critic and not uh forgetting our latest highlights of the weekend That is what is coming to follow after This Weekend
<$B> This weekend the Kenya National Theatre was full to the brim When that kind of <-_things><+_thing> happens it is news since it is the exception rather than the rule although it would have been desirable if the reverse were true Because we want it to be the rule we've got to ask why the auditorium was full On that evening a musical group Black Voices from Britain was performing in the country for the first time Black Voices is an a-capella group consisting of six members namely Andrea Green Sandra Frances Ann-Mary Bonnett Beverly Robinson Carol Pemberton who is the artistic director and Bob Ramdani who is the administrative director The fact that this was the group's first performance in the country was reason enough for enthusiasts to turn up in large numbers But I don't know whether not to suspect that it had something to do with our fascination with that which is foreign Under normal circumstances you will hear the excuses for people not attending shows at the Kenya National Theatre to revolve around the charge that the theatre is placed far from transport termini if it is not blamed too that ticket prices are too high If these charges were true then nobody would have watched to the Black Voices First the location of the theatre has not changed and then the show started at eight in the evening Secondly the tickets were priced at two hundred shillings per person take it or leave it But you should have seen the jostling at the door Watching the group perform one inevitably appreciated the fact that the members have great voices and they are putting those voices to good use Given that they perform without instrumental accompaniment their voices have to compensate and they do But as I kept looking at them one thing kept crossing my mind and that is Do we have singers of that calibre in this country I came to the conclusion that we do In fact I kept thinking of the tall vocalist with Musically Speaking <name/> Then I wondered whether we turn up in such large numbers to watch such our artists when they put up their shows I thought we don't and came to the conclusion that we had better support our artists with our presence the way we supported the Black Voices One thing you will almost always hear is the lack of financing among performing groups whether they are musical or theatre groups One thing that you will also hear is that it is very difficult to get sponsorship even if it is in the form of advertisement in the performance programmes You would notice however that Black Voices benefited immensely from just these very things that local groups hardly ever seem to get The advertisement in the programme was simply heavy If advertisers were as generous with local groups then performing art as an industry in this country would have taken off But again I feel that the advertisers have the same fascination with that which is foreign If not then maybe we do not approach the right sources or are not aggressive enough Leaving Black Voices alone let us come back to the school text Romeo and Juliet which has been touring the country for about three weeks When this play was touring Western Kenya three of the artists in the group Tony <?/>Jiguna <name/> <?/>Jeroge and <?/>Delano <?/>Longui abandoned the programme and returned to Nairobi ahead of the rest of the group which was still showing They named disagreement with the administration of the programme as reason for their act Despite the act the group went ahead and finished the programme having replaced them with other artists Elsewhere <name/> Players were staging <ea/><O/> the Kikuyu translation of Robert <?/>Silmaga's <?/>Mechangua and a similar thing happened The lead role Mwangi Kimani abandoned the group and hence put the group into the problem of getting another artist to do the part This is not the first time such things are happening but I wish it was the last time Why Agreeing to take a part in a production is a major decision which an artist cannot take lightly When such a decision is made the artists should be having the intention to last the whole production unless heavy personal constraints dictate against doing so This is because artistic engagement should be seen as a mission and therefore handled with religious view In the case of Romeo and Juliet it was a commitment for the whole nation considering that this is a play being studied and it is not the easiest to the schools The group doing the play has not tried but to strive to give the schools the best Now the best is not co-opting artists into major parts because those who are <O/> for those parts have chickened out What this leads to is embarrassment for the group and some sadistic heroism for the defecting artist It gives a poor impression of a group and that's very bad public relations for any other group that might want to embark on a similar problem It kills the moral of the other artists but more than anything else it forms a rather ugly entry in the curriculum vitae of the defecting artist This is simply because one of the greatest characteristics of an artist is reliability It is so much ingrained in some artists that they will crawl onto stage even when they are ill but just to ensure that they fulfil their contract with the group Even if they may not be the best stage artists their commitment earns them the confidence of directors It is this kind of artist that we need not the best actors who have no discipline Am I in any way exonerating the administration of the groups that have been hit by defection Not at all I am in fact saying that every time an artistic programme is being undertaken the terms must be understood very well in advance and the artists told what constraints to expect Furthermore the administrators must also respect their agreements with the artists It all boils down to the question of diplomacy As artists we are human beings and should be able to talk out our differences without resorting to measures that harm our art It should be advisable that every time a producer is recruiting artists he knows what artist he's dealing with It is advisable that every time an artist is getting into a production he or she knows exactly what the rules of the game are Otherwise the side breaching the agreement should be asked through court action to compensate the agreement party When this starts happening then our seriousness as artists will be recognised

<$A> <name/> Gatheru an education officer of the National Museums of Kenya talking about the Olulula forest nature reserve In this week's edition of our programme we travel all the way to Nyanza province Mr Owen Zumbo is the acting curator of Kisumu museums and is going to tell us more about the Kisumu museum
<$B> Nyanza province has many pre-historic and archaeological sites in which research has been done for many years Since the nineteen thirties Dr Louis Leakey and many others have excavated many sites in this region Thus it is a result of this site that the idea of a central museum in Kisumu came into being but the minister decides effectively In the nineteen seventies UNESCO came up with the idea of taking museums to the people thus creating regional museums Kisumu museum had thus a humble beginning when phase one in which was turned into the main gallery was constructed between nineteen seventy-six and nineteen eighty It was opened to the public on seventh April nineteen eighty Since then it has systematically grown and now encompasses phase two used now as education hall and multipurpose hall Snake park crocodile pond fresh water aquarium and traditional Luo home state they're all of Kisumu museum Like any other <O/> museum Kisumu museum is charged with the responsibility of collecting preserving and cataloguing natural and cultural history material for exhibition education and research Thus regional museums can be seen as an extension of the many <-_museum><+_museums> in Nairobi <./>speciali specialising in topics of interest to the region in which they occur The local community has thus to identify itself with the museum and the museum has to be seen to serve their interest The local community has a duty to actively participate in the development of the regional museum And that is why our museum has adviser committee appointed from the local community to advise and monitor development Exhibits our main gallery exhibits cultural history material from Nyanza province Western province and parts of Rift Valley There are a few cases on natural history at our museum The starved lion attacking a <?/>Volta beast and the <O/> on primates leopard and birds create curiosity among the many visitors who visit our museum The monkey on a beautiful old <O/> is admired by all our visitors Two cases are under construction One will house origins of man casts which are on very high demand by standard seven and eight and the other will house a gigantic <O/> which was caught in Siaya district nineteen seventy-eight by local fishermen It was given to the museum by fisheries department in Kisumu Kisumu museum has a modern snake house featuring a variety of venomous snakes from Kenya Since most of these snakes are poisonous they are securely kept in cages with glass windows Conspicuous snakes in this house are horned viper path adder forest cobra red spitting cobra Madagascar bore black spitting cobra green mamba and fifteen-foot python Plans are under way to put <O/> on display in the near future The horned viper was brought from the Kamega forest recently In the snake pit we keep non-poisonous snakes These include thunder snakes <?/>linkmarks black tree snakes juvenile pythons and <O/> which is <O/> There are three adult crocodiles in the pond and a juvenile in a small secluded pond otherwise if the large ones <-/>ones catch it they'll eat it At <O/> there are several species including fresh water turtles There is a giant tortoise which we understand was brought into Kenya in the nineteen thirties Surprisingly it is still going strong Such giant tortoises are known to live for about two hundred years There is a traditional rural homestead of a man with three wives and two sons An old man lives there who advises the community on matters concerning customs and family affairs Kisumu museum also has the best fresh water aquarium in Kenya featuring Lake Victoria fish Mr <?/>Njamenia who had both the snake park and the aquarium works in liaison with Mr Jumba a research scientist at Kenya Marine Research Institute at Kisumu It is possible to see over ten species of Lake Victoria fish at our Aquarium Activities of Kisumu museum Education is a very important function of all our museums in Kenya and National Museums of Kenya has been accepted as a supplementary educational institution At our museum we have a full-fledged education officer Naturally we employ trained graduate teachers with at least three years teaching experience The education officer is charged with the responsibility of making programmes for school parties which visit the museum The programmes are an interpretation of our exhibits which he simplifies for school parties to understand There are two kinds of programmes One <O/> programmes where he conducts museum tours explaining exhibits to school parties and colleagues Two - specific programmes where he gives a lecture on a specific topic followed by relevant film For school parties each individual now pays three shillings to enter the museum and college students pay five shillings To reach more people we also organise extensive services for schools and colleges Since it is very expensive to go out and visit one school we ask a number of schools to come together We go and give a lecture and film shows Occasionally we may have public film shows at market places Most our films are on conservation and specific scientific topics On first June this year we introduced culture activities at our museum on Sundays which include traditional dances drama mimes poetry reciting <O/> music at <O/> For listening or dancing we pay the artists an honorarium which is negotiable We therefore request the people within Kisumu to visit us and enjoy themselves For the Sunday programmes we just take the usual gate fee of ten shillings per person You'll be able to see the museum and enjoy yourself Outside stations As I said in the beginning we have several archaeological and pre-historic sites which fall under the jurisdiction of Kisumu museum Fort <O/> in the Kericho District where Doctor Louis Leakey found the remains of <O/> At Sonjo in <?/>Xhumo District there are two sites A pre-historic site of miocene period where homonoids similar to proconsul africanus lived An archaeological site and of <O/> stone age similar to that one at <name-/> <name/> and <name/> where Dr Louis Leakey found the remains of homo sapiens <-/>sapiens At Rusinga in Homa Bay District Miss Mary Leakey found the remains of proconsul africanus in nineteen forty-eight Kakamega Kakamega is a new development The district development committee has already approved our proposal from museum in Kakamega and we have been given a go-ahead to look for a suitable site Since we would like to set up a natural history museum to exhibit the natural diversity of Kakamega forest in particular and Western Province in general the land we want should be on periphery of the forest or in the forest itself Kakamega forest is of interest for us because it is the furthest extension of the Great Equatorial Forest which covered Africa many years ago It has unique fauna and flora The rare <O/> has been sighted at Kisere which is just a section of Kakamega Forest Jameson's Mamba whose bite cannot be treated is endemic here Mount Elgon peak can still be seen Thus a museum in this forest will form a wonderful research centre Thimlich Okinga I am going to dwell briefly on one archaeological site which the public is not aware of but once opened to the public it is going to be a very interesting and exciting site museum just like <name/> This is Thimlich Okinga Thimlich Okinga plural Okingin in Luo means a scaring bush will be stone enclosures Thimlich Okinga is situated in north <name/> location of <name/> division of Ngori district South Nyanza The site was declared a national monument nineteen eighty-three under the antiquities and monument act but no efforts were made to publicise the site It's about fifty acres and consists of large stone enclosures builded by a people whose origin we do not know about five centuries ago Distribution of these enclosures in South Nyanza The enclosures are not confined to <name/> only but distributed in <-/>in the two districts of South Nyanza and Homa Bay The general size of these stone wall enclosures was fifty metres in diameter At Sindo the enclosures are about half a kilometre from the shores of the lake overlooking sheltered beaches to there before <./>ha uh for uh handling canoes At Muru Bay one <O/> shelters are caved which is on a cliff on the shores of Lake Victoria The local people call it <ea/><O/> which means in Luo the end of the journey Their oral history however says this cave was used for protection There's pottery in the cave which needs an archaeologist to interpret its marvels The local oral history also has it that the general movement of this people was from north to south At <name/> modern law family live inside the Okingin The climax of this evolution was at village <name/>

<$A> Hello and welcome to another edition of the programme Do You Know In this week's edition we are going to look at the greatest officially recorded number of children born to one mother some of the fastest animals in terms of speed like the cheetah the fastest planes and motorcars in the world the first <?/>forces to be found and the longest canal in the world Do you know that the greatest officially recorded number of children born to one mother is sixty-nine These sixty-nine children were conceived by the first wife of <?/>Fjordon <?/>Wasselejew He was a peasant from Shuya which is two hundred and forty-one kilometres that is one hundred and fifty miles east of Moscow in the former USSR She was born in seventeen oh seven and died in seventeen eighty-two In twenty-seven confinements she gave birth to sixteen pairs of twins seven sets of triplets and four sets of quadruplets 
<$B> This case was reported to the Moscow by the monastery of <?/>Nikovsky on twenty-seventh of February seventeen eighty-two At least sixty-seven children who were born in the period seventeen twenty-five to seventeen sixty-five survived infancy On thirty-first of January nineteen eighty-nine Mrs <?/>Marei <?/>Olivera who was born in nineteen thirty-nine in San Juan Argentina gave birth to her thirty-second child It is believed that all her thirty-two children are alive In another happening Elisabeth who was the wife of John <?/>Mot from the United Kingdom gave birth to forty-two children She married John <?/>Mot in sixteen seventy-six She died in seventeen twenty forty-four years after her marriage
<$A> According to an inscription on a gravestone in Conway church cemetery Gwyned North Wales Nicolas <?/>Hooks was the forty-first child of his mother Alice <?/>Hooks He died on the twenty-seventh of March sixteen thirty-seven However further details are lacking for it has not been possible to collaborate or refute this report Mrs Elisabeth <?/>Greenwhile of <name/> is alleged to have given birth to thirty-nine children that is thirty-two daughters and seven sons Her son whose name was Thomas was the author of a book known as The art of embalming which was published in seventeen oh five 
<$A> Mrs <?/>Ada Watson who was born on twenty-third of June eighteen eighty-six gave birth to twenty-five children These included three sets of twins She died in hometown London on fifth of February nineteen thirty-four but who are the champion mothers of today
<$B> Today's champion mothers are believed to be Mrs Margaret M C North who was born in nineteen twenty-three and Mrs Mirabel Constable who was born in nineteen twenty Mrs Margaret M C North comes from <name/> Heath Birmingham She has twelve boys and ten girls All these are single births but two boys died in infancy The second champion mother whose name is Mirabel Constable comes from Long <name/>Warwicks She has also twenty-two children This includes a set of triplets and two sets of twins
<$A> Let us now turn our attention to the oldest mother to conceive
<$B> Medical literature contains extreme cases of mothers such as Mrs Ellen Alice age seventy-two She allegedly gave birth to a stillborn which was her thirteenth child on fifteenth of May seventeen seventy-six This was in her forty-sixth year of marriage However the oldest recorded mother for whom the evidence satisfied medical certification was Mrs Ruth Alice <?/>Kissler who was formerly Mrs Sheppard She was born in eighteen ninety-nine and died in nineteen eighty-two She came from Portland Oregon USA A birth certificate indicated that she gave birth to a daughter whose name was Susan at Glendal in California USA This occurred on eighteenth of October nineteen fifty-six when she was aged fifty-seven years old
<$A> In another happening Dr E Gras reported the case of one of his patients who gave birth to a healthy baby at the age of fifty-nine years and five months The woman had already a married daughter aged forty years Lastly according to a report in the Lancet of eighteen sixty-seven a woman reputedly aged sixty-two years gave birth to triplets She had previously born ten children However with the current trend of living it is very difficult to raise up many children 
<$A> Speed is relative Tortoises can only stand and look all in amazement as they are overtaken by the fastest of all their kind which is a giant tortoise It can travel just one and a half kilometres which is an equivalent of one mile in six hours In nineteen fifty-six the world was astonished when Dr Roger Bannister ran a mile in under four minutes Today such a time is common place for this distance In nineteen oh three Wilbur and Orville Wright piloted the first engine powered aircraft successfully Nowadays planes can fly at twice the speed of sound The Apollo spacecraft can reach a speed of nearly forty thousand kilometres per hour that is twenty-five thousand miles per hour When motorcars were first introduced an act of parliament was passed in Britain stating that every motorcar had to be preceded by a possum carrying a red flag as people were so scared of the speed at which the vehicles could travel Today's cars can travel at well over two hundred kilometres that is one hundred and twenty miles per hour What about animals Which is the fastest
<$B> Animals have to move quickly to survive Some such as the cheetah chase their prey with lightning speed Over distances of a few metres the cheetah is the fastest land animal with a top speed of eighty-nine kilometres per hour which is equivalent to fifty-five miles per hour However it can be outrun by the strong horn antelope over short distances Some horses and dogs can also run fast Race horses have been trained at more than sixty-five kilometres per hour that is forty miles per hour What of plants which plants grow fast
In nineteen seventy-four a plant known as <name/> was planted in Malaysia Within thirteen months it had reached a height of ten point seven four metres that is thirty-five feet No other plant has been recorded as having grown so tall very quickly like this plant known as <name/> Another plant known as <name/> which is a microscopic protozoa has been recorded as having travelled a distance of forty times its own length in one second
<$A> Leaving aside the fastest animals in the world and also plants which grow very fast let us now come down to the fastest motorcars and planes in the world
<$B> A man known as Richard Melbourne felt a jolt as if he had hit a brickwall and heard a sound like thunder behind him as he drove his car Believe it or not he was travelling at over one thousand and eighteen kilometres per hour That is six hundred and thirty-three miles per hour At that time he broke the world land speed record This speed is many times faster than the fastest ships and racing cars but pales into insignificance when we think of the USA space shuttle which operates at a speed of over twenty-eight thousand kilometres per hour that is seventeen thousand miles per hour
<$A> The fastest operational bomber planes are the Freeborn Mirage four which fly at a speed of two thousand three hundred and thirty-three kilometres per hour that is one thousand five hundred miles per hour

<$A> And every year we normally have about three or four students carrying out their project at the Centre of Nuclear Disaster And the thing that we do to them is to teach them the technique and how to use equipment And as you can imagine if we're going to produce a full MA thesis every year and for the last four five years that's what we've done that's quite a good production Initially we were about two of us then another group two and that They were the early years it wasn't that productive but now we <-/>we're quite productive we are <-_>we are<-/> producing four three four theses every year In addition people who are not really doing masters <./>stu master theses or you know research of that kind And they <./>real they really just want to know what is in their samples They make use of our facilities And those ones have also benefited in the sense that our technique is not that expensive compared to others
<$B> Yes how do you compare to others and how would somebody reach you and what kind of analysis do you do that probably will be beneficial to people in the rural areas for example
<$A> Yeah let me start here by soil Somebody may be interested say in agriculture He wants to know uh how the soil uh what the soil contains in terms of micro-nutrients And that person would bring that sample to us and we only charge about five hundred shillings per sample and maybe twenty-five shillings per element extra element what he wants And once we've done the analysis that person is in a better position to know this soil of mine contains ABCD And uh if I go to now to say an agricultural officer he'll advise me what to apply to the soil That particular person will benefit from that If uh <-/>if you consider say somebody who is dealing with effluents like uh Mr <name/> said he'd now want to know whether those effluents are uh toxic And you bring the sample and we analyse and we find say it has high levels of say uh lead and we would advise that company to do something about these effluents Instead of discharging it into the river they do a bit of re-treatment where it goes into the river You may be say uh somebody interested in environmental pollution like Mr <name/> was with a uh another student and you want to know what is being produced by cars uh the emission You want find the lead levels in the emission And once the analysis has been done and you look at the data you can tell whether we <-/>we are actually polluting our <-/>our environment or not
<$B> Yes now Mr Menaris on the basis of what you are saying and your other colleague says enormous amount of knowledge already existing in your centre uh Now how does this knowledge reach the ordinary person apart from exchange of ideas at seminar level forums of your peers How about the Kenyan population How do you reach them
<$A> We try to participate in the factory workshop which is related to uh and <-/>and where we can be able to express or give our uh <-/>our findings to people both locally and internationally And in fact starting from this Sunday one of our colleagues has gone to Nigeria to present a paper on our findings And we've uh participated I think in all <O/> workshops since I think nineteen eighty-eight We also publish uh in established journals and I think uh once in a while you've read in the one of the few papers like mention of our findings And we try to use all the <-/>the channels that are available including the one we are on right now
<$B> Okay and what kind of Yes
<$C> <O_><O/> some more on publicity 
<$A> We have also trying to participate in the <-/>the ASK show Nairobi main one because it's nearer to us and always anybody visiting the university booth always sees something on the Centre of Nuclear Science Techniques We have been showing people how we can utilise it We also have been uh uh selling our centre through the mass medias on a <O/> We have a journal which is an international journal And uh scientists from all over the world and various laboratories are subscribing to it And uh this is one way where people can <O/> to it
<$B> Yes how about the rural areas Do you think they would be fully understood always understood How do you reach them 
<$C> For the rural area for example one project we are doing with the faculty of agriculture it's getting to the farmers on preservation of their food post-harvest and harvest losses
<$B> Through famine demonstration exposures or what
<$A> Exposures and also trying to see whether we can also utilise nuclear technique in trying to alleviate uh this anomaly in the <-_>in the<-/> whole farming system 
<$B> Yes
<$A> So this is something I think uh within the last three years we have really come to be known by quite a lot of people although there is still a lot more to be done anyway
<$B> Okay
<$A> But
<$B> Fine 
<$A> <O_><O/>
<$B> Yes Mr <name> I tender to ask you to comment briefly on the existing institutional collaborations nationally maybe the centre or the University of Nairobi
<$C> We've uh <./>beg The nature of nuclear science is such that it's very unlikely to only be working on an island of your own You tend to <-/>to interact with other scientists And in <-/>in Kenya what is being used mostly <-/>mostly is isotopes And the areas where it's being used it's like <O_><O/> And by virtue of the fact that we we've got a centre for nuclear science which most people know about

<$C> Next is Breastfeeding Corner a programme that will come to you at a quarter to nine With you in the studio from now up to closedown is Tabitha <?/>Motemi It's now a quarter to nine Breastfeeding corner
<$A> Breastfeeding Corner Babies need appropriate nutrition affection stimulation and protection against infection Breastfeeding meets these needs and gives them the best start in life It is natural and a basic part of the life process For breastfeeding to be successfully started and continued the mother needs the active support of her family the community and health workers All have a contribution to make Mrs Betty <?/>Multuri an officer with a breastfeeding information group compares an expectant mother to a host who is eagerly waiting for a very important visitor Such a host she says spends a lot of time doing everything possible so as to accord his visitor a grand reception An expectant mother starts preparing a few days before delivery
<$B> The preparation starts with the mother and all mothers I suppose in Kenya today know that immediately the mother know that she's expecting she should go and see the doctor in the clinic Those who have got clinics in the city commission or in government <-/>government hospitals we know that there are health workers waiting to help us and to start clinic to start being examined being uh guided on how to live with this pregnancy what to do so that we can be <-_health><+_healthy> when carrying this baby and how to deliver is very very important for a mother to start antenatal clinic as soon as she knows that she's pregnant What we should do is to go to the clinic and you are seen by the doctor The important of being seen is to be guided on some <-/>some of the difficulties and some of the uh uh illnesses minor illnesses which mothers encounter when she's expecting Not all mothers are <-_health><+_healthy> Some mothers are very <-_health><+_healthy> indeed when they are carrying babies but some mothers have complications Because you know the mother expecting a baby her body changes very much and these changes bring a bit of interruption in the body system and in the health of the <-/>of <-/>the mother Uh first of all you have to be checked if it's first baby to know whether the baby is uh you are healthy enough to carry the baby what you need what you need to eat and how you should prepare yourself Mothers should prepare themselves even before they know that they are pregnant They should be <-_health><+_healthy> before pregnancy comes And this is to eat balanced diet so that the mother is healthy enough to carry a baby because this baby is going to use a lot of uh mother's energy and the mother should eat properly before she is pregnant Because the first three months of pregnancy many mothers have no appetite Some tend to vomit in the morning within one month to three months Some uh don't like even eating They eat very little and so it's good when a mother is well-nourished before pregnancy
<$A> It is through your breasts that the baby receives all that she or he needs for a healthy growth and development Needless to say an expectant mother knows this Such a mother prepares her nipples during pregnancy by pulling them out gently After bath she rubs her nipples with a towel to make the skin stronger Some mothers express a few drops of milk every day during the last few weeks of pregnancy Mrs <-/>Multuri goes on to advise the mother what to do as she waits for her baby
<$B> Mothers always have good breasts but we have different nipples And this difference in nipples we have to know earlier before the baby comes Some mothers have got very small breasts Others have got big breasts but the difference of sizes of the breasts does not matter at all Breasts which are big large small all of them have milk enough for a baby So we should not worry If you have small breast please <ea/>mama don't think that you'd you are not going to have enough milk If you have large breast also know that you have enough milk for your baby Sizes doesn't matter When you expect the body changes I want to tell mothers who uh experience to be mothers for the first time to know that your bra which you wear before you are <-/>you <-/>are pregnant you'll not be able to wear it because it will be you'll start enlarging Your bust you enlarge and then also your tummy will start enlarging That should not worry you You start having a very dark area on your breast which is called the aureola and becomes more darker when you are expecting and it starts even looking as though you have smeared a bit of <-/>of <-/>of <-/>of <-/>of uh uh <-/>of fat or <-/>or about uh something like lanolin because the body starts producing fat to prepare that nipple around so that it's ready for the baby to come and you know nature is very good God <-_prepare><+_prepares> us before this baby comes Also milk starts coming in the breast and you start feeling inside your breast a bit of ticklish sometime That is the milk being prepared in your breast So you should not worry 
<$A> Breasts should be taken care of to avoid engorgement or the condition of being hard and even if a mother has flat or inverted nipples it's no excuse for not breastfeeding 
<$B> Some nipples are flat that you see very little of a nipple Others are very nice They're they look protruded outside and they are they look very nice You just breastfeed the baby without any problem I'm trying now to talk to these mothers who have got uh flat nipples The nipple is there but it's very short sometime you can't even see it <ea/>Mama you have to prepare yourself if you have got this flat nipple and how are you going to manage it The healthworkers in the clinic will help you They have something we call nipple-shield You just have to tell them about your nipples yourself Maybe the doctor will find out by himself when examining you If they don't find <-/>find out how your nipples are please tell them Say my nipples are flat I don't know what to do Then they'll tell you what to do You you'll have something called nipple-shield as I have told you and they'll give you that nipple-shield and they'll show you how to put it on you fix it on <-/>on your <-/>on <-/>your both nipples and you put a <-/>a brown top so that the nipple is pressed inside It has a hole so the nipple will be pushed in that hole and will be always will be pulled out and by the time you deliver a baby your nipples will be out ready to breastfeed So if you do that you'll be ready for your breastfeeding If you don't have that nipple-shield you can use a jerry-can top Is very useful You just put two jerry-can tops on each one on each uh breast and you put your bra and it will keep on pulling the nipple and for the period you are pregnant by the time you deliver the nipple will be ready Another thing I want to tell mothers It's very important to try to express a little bit of a milk every day After you have a bath pull the nipples out and you roll them a little bit with your forefingers between your forefingers and express a little bit of milk That helps the mother to open the ducts These ducts are always blocked If you don't express the milk a little bit of milk they'll remain blocked and as soon as you have a baby as you <-/>you experience some mothers soon after delivery they complain that the milk is not coming because the ducts are still blocked so the time for us to prepare yourselves is this time when we are expecting Every day after you have your shower express a few drops of milk from your from each breast to open these ducts to get ready for the milk to flow easily when you start breastfeeding 
<$A> After delivering a few problems might come up some of which arise in the first three days 
<$B> One of them is uh engorged breasts The second one is cracked nipples The other one is painful breasts and the other one is mother's thinking that the milk is not coming out I have solved that milk not coming out because when you express I told you the ducts will be open but about engorgement most of the time it occurs because we mothers don't put the baby on the breast on demand Any time the baby cries you put that baby on the breast so that the milk doesn't accumulate in your breast The milk is made each time the baby suckles She he suckles the milk which is made and after that the milk goes and then it get finished and then another one is made when the baby is breastfeeding again So if you don't empty that breast by breastfeeding on demand the milk will be remaining in your breast and that way that accumulation will make the breast engorged

Kenyan music just like coffee tea and other cashcrops can be exported and fetch foreign exchange The failure in the task of popularizing our music to foreign audiences could be blamed wholly on the negative attitude of those who should be in the forefront But one point to ponder a popular Kenyan musician wants to go on an overseas tour to promote Kenyan music He approaches the United Nations Environmental Scientific and Cultural Organisation UNESCO Commission for Education with his proposals and objectives All the required arrangements including the funding is taken care of But the musician cancels the tour at the eleventh hour Or another musician equally popular approaches the same organisation for the same purpose and everything for the tour is approved and only await an itinerary from the musician He promises to bring the programme and that is the last that is heard of him It could be true that most of those who have been approached have exhibited a cold shoulder on or outrightly expressed open disinterest and dismissed the proposals presented to them by the artists At the same time when a promoter brings in a popular musician there is a hue cry by the local musicians that they have been given a raw deal and are being ignored Some outspoken musicians are not against the idea of flying in a foreign musician but are bitter when the same organisations who had been approached for sponsorship without success by local musician lavishly sponsor the foreign musician But have the <-_musician><+_musicians> exhausted all the avenues to better their lot Is there hope that one day they'll be able to share a common stage with internationally acclaimed musicians and receive foreign audiences Are they organized enough to lobby for such goals or is it their ill equipment and organizations that is their greatest undoing Are they themselves partly to blame Although most of them may not agree the avenues are there The hopes too are there But it is the committment of some of the musicians that has hampered the development and promotion of Kenyan's music abroad The UNESCO Commission for Education which is at Commerce House Nairobi has a scheme which if fully exploited could raise the standards of music The Commision Secretary General Chacha Ogwe told Kenyan Beat that the scheme is more or less a promotion of artists' programme and depending on the availability of funds from the UNESCO headquarters it should sponsor artists' projects annually He added that he has always been ready to assist musicians in their endeavours to promote our music and culture But year in year out the funds earmarked for the scheme end up unused due to the indifference of the musicians 
There are about three programmes in which funding is done according to proposal and priority But in all of them the musicians have a big chance of putting their cases across for their own benefit The dialect in which a song is sung is secondary A good composition couple coupled with good arrangement and quality production will sell anywhere Our musicians should therefore stop bickering about who is not doing what but exploit all the possible avenues to improve their quality of music Benga music certainly appears to many people Today Kenyan Beat News and Views takes you to Migori where we meet one of the Benga maestros John Ouma Johnny the band leader of Omore Kings Some of you had written to us the request to feature this musician Omore Kings was started six years ago and has released some chart busters like Vicky Jaber <-_>cham duonda<ea/> and many others Omore Kings which is based in Migori Suna was started in nineteen eighty-six Some of the founder members who are vocalists are Oguda Otis Omondi Sinai bassist Samual Okidi and Idede Chips Some of them have left the band Ouma who has many other nicknames like Waka Waka told Kenya Beat that the group has modernized Benga making it easier to dance The band has a large following in South Nyanza and Nyanza Their current line-up is bass Samual Okidi drummer Peter Odur vocalist Owuor Jamapera and Thomas Ogutu rhythm Aguambo Jim and dancer Grace Akoth the solo guitarists Omindi Sinio and the band leader John Ouma Johnny 
Germany based Kenyan musician Gordon Simon is back in the country to catch up with the possible matters and spread his gospels of rock music according to a report appearing in one of the local dailies 
Known years for his days with a Black Savage band Simon intends to spend four weeks here spreading a Jimmy Hendriks revival which shows in Mombasa and Nairobi He said the band will be called Wanasavage adding that he has brought a range of guitar effects for his musical preference Once playing with one of the very few rock bands here Simon went to the Germany in the early eighties finally settling at Hamburg He admits life is not a bed of roses out there and lack of a recording deal widely seen as a ticket to any other artist door to success kept him out of playing Before arriving here for a month long break he worked on tours with Maxi Priest and a jazz group called Inkognito His involvement with Germs a sound light company in Germany he said gives him additional skills as a sound and light man For two years he tried African music playing a lot of this and that and a lot of Benga which he said was a new dimension for him and for hundreds of fans who caught his band in action After playing rock with Savage in city schools here and producing an album with EMI Simon teamed up with Madagazkar's Rasaka Mawi who shared his Hendriks' learning and together awakened the city rock crowd He changed to Afro Music and stirred the scene with Koth Biro Europe is not easy he repeats and everything is determined by a good recording deal and that is not easy to come by The idea he said is to keep one afloat and work tot the music which is how he got to work as a sound and light technician 
Simon will be looking for new musical influences mostly on the lines of blending traditional African drum patters and lace them with synthesizer roughs And now looking forward to December Musicly Speaking fans in Mombasa got very good news The group will be in Mombasa From twenty-third to twenty-fifth they'll be performing at Safari Beach Hotel On twenty-sixth which is Boxing Day they'll be at Mamba Village and on twenty-seventh they they'll be at Serena Beach Hotel and from twenty-eighth to thirty-first they'll be at Nyali Beach Hotel Black Voices an acapella group from Britain were in the country last week and we caught up with them at the Kenya National Theatre Their choices of songs was historical tracing The History of Black Music Journeying through America Caribbean and with a hint of African roots 
The musicians Carol Pemberton also the group leader Beverly Robinson and Ma-Mary Bonnett Rossalie Sinclair and Sandra Frances kept the audience entertained singing Nobody knows the troubles I have seen By the rivers of Babylon Lean on me Let my little light shine and Sense Sina a South African tune during their two-hour show at the City Hall last Saturday and added glamour was given by Muungano National Choir internationally acclaimed through the chartbreaking Misaluba recording 
With a brief but high voltage performance the Boniface Magannga Outfit proved again that it is still one of the best around and the clever choice of material a testimony to the riches of Kenya's music heritage With Black Voices and Muungano Nairobi residents have had a fine instance of what good talents can achieve and that both know no prejudice Musicians and producers have devised a way of sustaining the industry taking music to the people Many of them told Kenya Beat that the only way to introduce their works to their fans is to go to them directly 
Musician cum <./>e producer Albert Gashero said musicians have realized that many cases of dubbing of their works is not intentional rather it is aggrevated by lack of original works Upcountry he said remains the greatest market for vernacular music The idea of going to the people was started with vigour by popular gospel singer Fostin Munishi who told Kenyan Beat the initiative has helped him boost his sales Next week in News and Views <./>re- we revisit Network Africa and until then I am Eric Odangy Good bye

<$A> Welcome to the program In this edition we shall talk on the belief-systems of the Turkana who live in Turkana District Rift-Valley-Province 
<$A> Turkana region has a hostile climate For this reason the Turkanas' philosophy of life is shaped by his environment It doesn't allow material or spiritual luxuries A Turkana is so aware of his hostile environment that he does not resort to the supernatural and mystic sides of life Instead he follows a common-sense point of view and moves where the opportunity is available and exploitable An individual is therefore not bound to stick to a group if better conditions exist and are available elsewhere As a matter of fact the Turkana generally has a very independent cast of mind At the age of four to five years he's capable of thinking of and finding ways and means for surviving on his own There are many cases of children splitting from their parents as early as the age of five for better opportunities elsewhere The philosophy of self-sufficiency is deeply entrenched in their psyche In the Turkana religious beliefs they believed in the existence of a high god that they referred to as <?/>Acujo It was believed that <?/>Acujo lived in the sky He was said to be omnipotent and could kill people who committed wrong things <?/>Acujo controlled rain and rainmaking In Turkana community there were professional rainmakers who executed their trade in consultation with god However god never intervened in rainmaking unless he was actively induced to do so Communal prayers could be held for rain and in the case of healing a sick person Occasionally such prayers were led by a diviner 
In Turkana community a <-/divinal> prophet is called <?/>Emron Any man could become a diviner but not women The powers and qualities of divination were not hereditary Diviners were initiated at two places <name/> and <name/> Turkana diviners appear perfectly normal with nothing in particular to distinguish them from ordinary beings They do not fuss over specific paraphernalia for treatment or divination Neither do they care for psychological mechanisms for diagnosis and treatment Some diviners acquire wealth as a result of fees paid for services rendered The payment could be a goat or some herd of cattle In Turkana community anyone could foretell the future by throwing down sandals and reading them Diviners however foretold the future by reading and interpreting the entrails of a goat or an ox He could also tell by directly soliciting and obtaining the required information from the high god In Turkana community there were magical diviners who are in a class of their own They could diagnose cure and advise the physically and mentally afflicted Their paraphernalia included pieces of skin which they used to ward off evils and to give the afflicted special strength and stamina from the high god A woman's barrenness could be cured through a diviner Likewise a diviner could magically protect one from danger and any other calamity It was usual for the diviner to communicate with the high god in a dream in his sleep During the dream god provided the prescription The principal treatment consists of smearing satin-coloured ocker grey blue green or yellow on a specified spot on the body Other treatment consists of strips of goat's skin or cow's hide to be used as general protective charms or in case of serious illness Divination was also practised prior to raiding and going out to war A diviner could sanction or advise against a military or cattle rustling adventure In most cases the diviner would order for the performance of a specific ritual These rituals involved the slaughtering of animals either a bull or a goat Specific parts of the slaughtered animal were then used in the ritual It was believed that the diviner acted through the powers of god It was important for people participating in the ritual to share the sacrificial meat The eating of sacrificial meat was some kind of bond where the participants express their willingness to share the consequences of the ceremony In southern Turkana <name/> and <name/> are places with permanent standing water These two posts are believed to be the residences of <?/>Adeti who resembles a man wearing a suit of baboon hair Periodically people disappeared from these places for two days and sometimes up to two months When they reappeared they were well fed and looked healthy It is said that the water <?/>Adeti took them to a place of abundant stock water grazing and food Invalids saved by the <?/>Adeti returned in perfect health Some of the diviners where initiated into their crafts through such disappearances The Turkana also had a vague belief in spirits Spirits were said to live in hills and mountains The spirits were generally said to be quiet However when they intervened in human affairs they were said to be very malevolent and came at night to mend people in their sleep In Turkana community certain animals and birds were associated with good and bad <-_omen><+_omens> It was believed that the spotted morning warbler warned of enemy attack by its chirping When the hawk eagle flew to the <ea/><O/> that is homestead it warned of the approaching murderer The appearance of the grey warren warbler announced the coming of a good visitor The death of a black kite in the <ea/><O/> was considered as a warning to the owner of the homestead He had to sacrifice a goat or else bad luck could befall him The grand hornbill green wood <?/>hobo spotted eagle or night <O/> and frogs were considered as prophets of rain In Turkana community evil is associated with stealing adultery and wild animals such as snakes Anything connected with pain and destruction is evil The Turkana was known to bury the dead particularly if the person died where they had settled for a long time The dead person was buried in a grave with gifts particularly from the closest relatives And now let us look at the history of the Turkana The Turkana have a verifiable myth of origin It says that a long time ago an old woman called <?/>Ngithigee came to eastern Turkana from Ngithigerr to gather wild fruits She went to the hill now called Murua Ngithigerr near Tarach river where she settled It is said that later on a bull got lost in Ngithigerr and came eastwards following Tarach until it reached <?/>Ngithigee's residence At night the bull slept in <?/>Ngithigee's compound From Ngithigerr eight young men who were <?/>Ngithigee relatives were sent to search for <?/>Ngithigee and the bull They travelled eastwards They found the bull and <?/>Ngithigee drying wild fruits They remained there with her for a few days and saw the place had good pastures and many kinds of wild fruits They returned to Ngithigerr and told the people about the wonderful place Hence a large group of young men and girls took cattle and went back to the east as though they were going to <ea/><O/> that is dry season cattle camps Therefore this group formed the first Turkana Most other Turkana oral traditions more or less concur with this myth They claim that after a generation of peace the Turkana begun to move eastwards When they left Tarach valley going eastwards they encountered the Samburu groups living in the higher areas of Central Turkana from as far north as Lokwanamoru Range near the Sudan border It is said that the Turkana stretched south to <name/> <name/> <name/> and <name/> and the hills called <name/> southwest of <name/> The traditions further claim that at first the Turkana only raided the neighbouring ethnic groups for livestock and thereby acquired camels for the first time However as time went by they took to waging sporadic wars against their neighbours According to another group of traditions the migrations which carried the Turkana from the land of <name/> in eastern Uganda started with a split that is a separation of the Turkana from the <?/>GiTheir ancestry and historical memories are shared with the <?/>Gi Thereafter the grazing and water needs of the stock dictated their settlement patterns and movements This trend more or less persists up to the present The Turkana are constantly on the move from the plains to the riverbank to the mountains and then back again and so on the whole time they build no permanent homes and settlements but live in temporary flimsy shelters Due to the tendency to move wherever grass and water is available the Turkana are understandably in endless competition and conflict with the <name/> <name/> <name/> <name/> <name/> <name/> and others Linguistic studies and the historical traditions of their western neighbours confirm that the Turkana <?/>Gi <name/> and <name/> have a common origin In the past land disputes over water and grazing land continued for a long time against their neighbours The Turkana had great military success Some historians attribute the numerous military successes of the Turkana to their military alliances with the <?/>Gi against whom it is said they never fought In pre-colonial and colonial times and despite the recurring violent conflicts the Turkana traded with their neighbours They traded cattle sheep and goats In return they received millet maize and maize meal tobacco spears iron cooking pots beads and ostrich eggs and feathers

<$A> and our cherished wildlife demands that we plant more trees and protect our natural resources for survival That is why Kenyans from all walks of life are being encouraged year in and year out to plant as many trees as possible Kenyans led by the country's leading environmentalist and conservator of resources His Excellency President Daniel Arap Moi have through sheer hard work and determination turned some dry parts of this country into green beautiful areas <Name/> in Kitui district of eastern province is one such place More areas can become as beautiful as <name/> if <ea/>wananchi plant trees at the right time They have been continuously reminded that our prospects and future problems are linked to the way we protect and exploit our natural resources The trees which are planted in agricultural and pastoral areas are important in that they after maturing provide <ea/>wananchi with firewood coal and other tree products Some trees are also used for making furniture while others are used for construction Another use to which we put our trees can be reflected in our desire to get poles and posts for fencing and supporting electricity or telephone transmission wires His Excellency President Daniel Arap Moi and other environmentalists have on several occasions decried the destruction of indigenous trees In some areas of our country indiscriminate felling of trees and burning of forestry areas have caused untold damage to fertile soil which we as a nation badly need for food production Realising that his people need to conserve the environment for use by future generations His Excellency President Daniel Arap Moi has been instrumental in the construction of <O/> for conservation purposes The President is a strong believer in conserving soil and the environment because it is our means of survival The emphasis in Kenya has been on indigenous trees Some government institutions private organisations schools and non-governmental organisations have come up with experimental tree nurseries with a view to discovering which trees are best suited for arid and semi-arid areas The Kenya Energy and Environmental Organisation KENGO is one body which has established an indigenous tree nursery at <name/> At Kanali on the main Nairobi national road a tree demonstration plot for indigenous trees has been established This project was started by His Excellency the President in nineteen eighty-eight <Name/> a creation of His Excellency the President have been established all over the country They support among other things the <O/> of the <-/encatchment> areas for our forests In most tree nurseries all over the country there are a variety of tree seedlings to pick from Nurseries have been established in every district with a view to making it easier for <ea/>wananchi to get trees to plant The cocoa planting area this year is expected to cover one thousand two hundred and forty-five scattered all over Kenya As you plant trees this year let us remember that it is a continuous exercise For every tree we cut down we should at least plant two to replace it In this way we shall be ensuring the future of our children
<$B> We are uh actually having uh enough trees for everybody in this country to plant so uh we're asking everybody to turn out uh to the nearest nursery uh <ea/>wananchi will be given free of <-/>free <-/>of <-/>free <-/>of charge about five seedlings to plant and please when the <ea/>wananchi plant they should take care of those seedlings because that means everybody plants one tree and we are about twenty-five million You <-/>you can uh realise that the country the whole country will be green within a very short time
<$A> As we move into the future we should as Kenyans continue to get involved in environmental and conservation initiatives for the sake of our own survival and the survival of our own children In that way we shall be making the world a better place to live in

<$A> Do you know what our critic has for us this weekend Over to Okumba Miruka
<$B> Kenya is supposed to be a multiracial country consisting of a populace of Blacks Europeans and Asians This is a fact that is reflected especially in the economic face of the country but it is a fact which should be reflected even more in the world of art Well is it The answer could be either way depending on who is answering the question but to a large extent it would be in the negative What am I talking about Last Saturday and Sunday Madam <?/>Umadevi <?/>Haslos Corps de Ballett Groupe put up a show at the Kenya Cultural Centre The Indian classical musical drama titled Devi the temple dancer concerns the plight of a princess who was cast to a life time of temple dancing by a Gypsy queen Actually it is the princess that offers to take up the dancing career after the queen has sentenced the whole village of children to dancing and would only release them if a choice maid would be committed to the career The princess Devi who takes up the career goes on to become the finest dancer ever known Rather than the fact that it was an Indian dancer the story rendered in mime with voice-overs in English is based on a familiar motive that exists even in African if not also European mythology That motive is that of a precious member of the community having to be sacrificed for the benefit of the larger society In this is couched the whole question of selflessness the individual versus the society and the fact that an adversity can be turned into something positive In African mythology this motive is very heavy in stories about girls who are sacrificed so that rain may come to the community In other words Devi's story could be understood by anyone regardless of race This was further enhanced by the voice-overs in English but the audience was predominantly Indian and European perhaps the African audience believing that being an Indian dance it would be performed in Hindi and they would not be able to follow Whatever the case might be it is noticed that audiences impose on themselves some kind of segregation even when this is not called for This is a rather sad state of affairs which we would gladly see come to an end if we are to broaden our precision of culture and art In fact watching performances from other cultures other than our own also brings us face to face with the new art forms and styles of producing that we could integrate into our own In <ea/>Uma Devi's show for example one first appreciates the fact that as small a stage as that of the Kenya Cultural Centre could be transformed into a whole world of beauty and elegance to take a whole dance group in creating what is essentially an epic For the time of the show it was simply a transposition into a new world Secondly and what I thought was more important was the use of mime and the excellent choreography that went into the production A certain drama critic James Birihanse once wrote that the future of Kenyan drama lies in the use of mime as the language He wrote that mime theater knows no boundaries of language and if well used is capable of a higher level of communication than words could ever achieve One might not agree with him entirely but one could concede that mime is one way of getting all races together to appreciate art from diverse backgrounds Coming to <ea/>Uma Devi's choreography the stage was a limiting factor due to its small size but <ea/>Uma Devi got round this by creating successive rather than simultaneous routines making sure in the process that the most important parts of the story were not overshadowed by overlapping action This was particularly obvious in the last scenes where Devi the temple dancer stars with breathtaking dances at one time involving an acrobatic routine where the dancer steps on a pan and performs on it Taking the lead role in this drama was a fourteen-year-old student of Wisa Oshell Girls High School Davia Vengra Ashiskall is now in form three but she started dancing when she was three years old at the behest of her mother herself a painter She has been with Madame <ea/>Uma Devi for the last eight years during which she has learned Bagatab Baratkatien and Kutjibuti Steps Davia says she would eventually want to be a medical doctor but she does not think this should take her away from dancing which is not only a pastime for her but also a means of learning about people's mythology and spirituality Saying that she loves Barat Katien most because she enjoys heavy footwork Davia has also tasted a bit of African dance That was when she was in Aga Khan Primary School Although she likes African dance because of its heavy footwork she found out that it has more sound than she desires Her favourite combination is a dance with heavy footwork but calm lyrics But watching her perform it becomes clear that she is a natural dancer who could be equal to any dance The performance also featured Bini Batell Samna Batell Sheka Gupta At Chen Atchana Janda Nehal Scha and Nilesch Scha One of the shows was done to aid the Council of Human Ecology of Kenya <ea/>Uma Devi puts up only one production in a year Having come to the country some forty years ago she has successfully grounded Indian classical dance in the country and has trained a core of young dancers who will obviously perpetuate that tradition 
Meanwhile ending at Bakenyal National Theatre tonight is the play Born of a lesser God being staged by Nelin and Daikey artists This is a play based on the realisation that Africans are not necessarily inferior and that they should rise and assert themselves This play features Robert Kioko as Despair James Mongi as Dignity Irene Jo as Civilisation Kari Karia as Money Charles Morunga as Uncle Amay Angela Mangu as Principal and Jaki Kiliria as Pamela Assinum Another play Flamingo directed by Jacob Butino ends at the French Cultural Centre tonight This is a play critical of the misuse of power by a military regime The play features Rono Sanija Polin Jeru Otera Gan and Tasim Mina among other artists Dan Nronja informs Preview that the United Freelands artists are rehearsing the play The Valiant by Holwa Bihol and Robert Middlemas This play will be staged at the French Cultural Centre from Thursday November fifth to Sunday November eighth It is a play about a man committed to death for a murder he actually committed The action takes place in the warden's office in the state prison at Wathersfield Connecticut at about half past eleven on a rainy night The play features Josef Omari Dan Ronja himself Damien White Bettina Shanta Dixon Okumu and Michael Lejodi

<$B> musician Julius <?/>Kanewe otherwise known as <?/>Bilo as he cruised along Nairobi's busy <O/> Road The song details the laws a woman should obey in the house if she does not want to risk divorce or worse Half of the passengers in the <ea/>matatu were women and most of them were not amused by the song and they wondered why the driver kept playing it as if it were the only one in the cassette Some of them alighted in protest and accused those who were left behind for being half-women who enjoy hearing and seeing their lot being ridiculed by male chauvinists I would like you to listen to this song titled or <ea/>Baba Kune and then we shall discuss it and see why it generated such a reaction from the women 
<$B> In this song the artist says where can they get an older woman who can cultivate the whole of the <ea/>shamba properly I keep on cultivating but it never stays for a day before weeds come back I seem to be blinded I feel like I can go mad when I know how much I have done The <ea/>shamba here refers to the woman The man has tried to train her and shape her but it has not worked So he says after cross-examination I have found out that all she needs is a set of regulations and the woman and her son Kune need to know that this is the year of discipline So he gives the following set of regulations One if I ever cough outside and you do not open the door you will stay out for twenty-four hours like a watchman Two if I ever come late and you ask me why I am late I shall stay for one month without eating food that you have cooked Three if I ever ask you anything and you become stubborn you will drink me and sneeze me out like one does with tobacco Four if I ever hear that you have gone to a neighbour to gossip to plait your hair or ask for salt and many other things that day you'll know why men eat bread that have been dipped in tea From this song you can easily see the artist's attitude towards women If a wife is like a <ea/>shamba what is implied by such an image It could mean that you can buy it and in this case you can work on it until it takes shape and colour that you want You notice also that <ea/>Baba Kune threatens a wife with not eating her food for one month What does this say about the role of women in the society that the artist comes from We do agree that the artist is saying that it is not only a duty for the woman to cook for her husband but it is also a privilege There is something very important in the article that I read at the beginning of this programme that refers to this song Let me now bring out some of the issues it raises These are that the people has demonstrated by the women's boycott of the <ea/>matatu not only enjoy the music they hear but also listen and respond to the messages that are communicated through oral literature that there are those who want to use oral literature to <./>mo communicate their views This includes the artists themselves <?/>Kanewe in this case who says I did not mean to annoy women All I'm doing is advising them not to be rude to their husbands if they want their marriages to last There is also the driver who keeps repeating the record for the women to hear All these people understand the value of oral literature and what a powerful tool for communication it is This is something that we cannot underestimate As teachers however as we said in our programme on fieldwork we cannot make students aware of contemporary oral literature without ourselves being aware I suggest that we listen to for instance the radio programmes particularly in vernacular programmes where artists are in various voices talking to majority of the people in this country We have to remember that the singers who create in their mother tongues are communicating with the young the old the literate and the illiterate and they are saying something to them as <?/>Bilo quoted above does There is also a sense in which these artists have been heavily influenced by their people's traditions and as you know language is a vehicle through which culture is transmitted and therefore original languages are closer to the people's culture From a song like the one we have heard there are very many issues that one can discuss This could be the artist's message the artist's attitude towards women the artist's attitude towards marriage the artist's use of traditions and the artist's use of language In yet another song by the same artist <ea/>Mama Kune the woman is given a chance to present her case So she says in a song I'm always too busy I have even forgotten to joke I don't want you to drop me like you do like a gourd of water or hot <ea/>ugali <?/>Kanewe bring elders to send me back home When you have enjoyed long enough you'll come back and find me and <ea/>Baba Kune replies What have I done <ea/>Mama Kune Let me tell you this is not <ea/><O/> or <ea/><O/> that you're asking me to dance I don't even know the first step One needs to be guided <ea/>Mama Kune then replies you know very well my dear that when you leave the house you never come back I don't know where you sleep If you come home and I give you food you never take it If I ever make the mistake of asking you where you have been you hit me with that food you beat me like the drum so that the <O/> people ask if there is a service going on <ea/>Baba Kune says you know very well that no newcomer brings warmth If I ever come later or not come at all I have been looking for property so if you talk badly even a slap you will get <ea/>Mama Kune says one who doesn't know my darling knows when she is told but you if I ask where you have been you will say you don't sleep on your ears you have been on business I ask what kind of business is this and I know it is not overtime How come it is always at night At the end of the song <ea/>Baba and <ea/>Mama Kune agree that there should be dialogue and that a separation will be as difficult as changing the title deed of the land You can see how well this artist presents the misunderstanding of wives and husbands in this song and the influence the song could have on the audience In order to fully appreciate this song you could ask your students the following questions Why has the woman forgotten to joke Why does the woman want to be given to elders that would send her home What does it say of the woman when she tells her husband that he will find her at home when he is through with enjoying life What is <ea/>Baba Kune's attitude towards the wife Do you consider the decision that their parting should be as difficult as a changing of the title deed justifiable What do you consider to be the status of women in this society These kinds of questions should help a student to understand and appreciate a piece of work even more At this juncture I would like to reiterate that it is not enough to tell the students to listen to the programmes on the radio It is important to take a piece of work a song for instance or <ea/><O/> and analyse it as we have done here discuss the themes and the language Let the students discuss with others songs from their various communities and the students will be richer Let them discuss their favourite musicians local artists or even foreign artists And in this way you will help them to have an appreciative mind and a critical one too Finally I would like you to listen to a record by <name/>The song is titled <ea/>Kwaheri <ea/>Bwana Like <?/>Kanewe's song that we have discussed it deals with the misunderstanding of a husband and wife As you listen to it I would like you to think about the following questions What is the woman's attitude towards her marriage What does <name/> say about the status of women in this community Who in your view is to blame for the breaking up of this marriage What precautions had the woman taken to maintain that marriage What do you think about the appropriateness of the tune of this song What do you think is the artist's attitude towards the husband of this woman

<$A> Its memories kept alive by the tourist industry <ea/>Bwana and <ea/>Memsahib tourist are encouraged to believe they have stumbled back in time into settlers' Nairobi Regiments of African servants early morning tea safaris in safari suits and journeys on the lunatic express are important elements in this adventure Today the inhabitants of the city see a very different Nairobi We see the settler-heart of Nairobi reduced to a few quaint buildings glossed by towering modern skyscrapers The Lamia Avenue now Kenyatta Avenue is crowded with confident Kenyans where once only white settlers shopped and gossiped Princess Elizabeth Way remained at independence and no longer sees the sedate passage of Austins Morris Minors and Series One Landrovers but as Uhuru Highway it is a racetrack for Toyotas Nissans and horror of horrors mobile discotheques called <ea/>matatus We occasionally see glimpses of the expensive suburbs of western Nairobi Langata Loratio Lavington Muthaiga and Roslin where luxurious houses sit in vast more or less fortified gardens and where even now most of the occupants are non-African
<$B> We regularly pass through the older denser and less expensive housing areas such as Parklands Pangani Giromo and Kariako where the concentrations of Nairobi's Asians live in cultural isolation in the dwellings they built sixty or seventy years ago
<$A> We hurry passed the chaotic and simmering mini-Mogadishu of Eastleigh expecting at any moment to see <?/>myriad maddened millions of Somali warlords and helicopter-borne United States marines in a bloody and vengeful shootout Even if we live there we shudder at the sight of the shanty slums of Vim Matari Valley Kauwamkwari and Kibera where the desperately poor live in crude shelters facing levels of hunger disease crime and violence which would make refugee camp life seem like paradise We see the expanding modern housing estates close to the City Centre such as Nairobi West South B and South C Woodly Bellevue Moi Oziende Madaraka Plain's View and Golden Gate built to house the new middle classes the upwardly mobile some of whom eventually move out into the richer suburbs
<$B> We see the sprawling unlovely and unloved satellite estates of East Nairobi Uhuru Buruburu Umoga Karibangi Pandora Bahati Donhom Kayole Kaloleni Makadara Ofafadorico Harambe Kimathi and Bahati where Nairobi's workers live through nightmares about their struggle to pay the rent for an apartment or just a room on their way to nightmare journeys to work on dangerous and overloaded buses and <ea/>matatus
<$A> But a city is much more than its houses A city is its people and their activities Even those visitors who break out of the tourist time world will see little beyond the structures the shell of the city It is what goes on inside the shell that turns a city into a cultural pinnacle and powerhouse the flagship of civilisation the most concentrated and accurate expression of that society's values and level of development
<$B> So what has gone on recently in Nairobi and what goes on today What are or what have been the most important social gossiping the things about which we can be justly proud secretly ashamed desperately worried or deeply perplexed
<$A> By far the most important recent and continuing event has been the growth of the city and its population The statistics which have little human impact tell a story of growth from about three million in nineteen forty-eight to about twenty-five million people in Kenya today
<$C> Nairobi's population has grown from a hundred and fifty thousand people to two million -
<$A> This growth <-_>this growth this growth<-/> has been the result of several reasons
<$B> Demographic increase women having babies faster than old people dying refugee increase movement of people from neighbouring states now or recently experiencing civil disorder such as Somalia Uganda Sudan Rwanda Zaire and Ethiopia other official and unofficial refugees Refugees' movements in developing regions of the world usually result in rural refugees becoming urbanised The country areas are too conservative and offer too few social and economic opportunities for refugees Mobile educated town refugees naturally gravitate to the centre of economic activities
<$A> Economic increase which assumes that as the country develops the concentration and expansion of economic activity in the capital city will continue and thereby attract traders and workers from the rural areas
<$B> Opportunistic increase The perception that the streets of Nairobi are paved with gold and belief that the big city is somehow more exciting that the village will attract young men and women looking for work riches and excitement
<$A> Destitution increase then arises from the belief that it will be impossible not to find some relief in such a concentration of affluence that comes most surely <./>for from such an overloaded table This attracts more people from villages and the rural areas who have somehow slipped through the mutual support network which characterises rural subsistent tribal life into genuine insupportable destitution
<$B> We experience this growth in a variety of ways In the pressure on public services and public <O/> Public transport can be a nightmare of bruising pinching elbowing and near suffocation There are too many passengers facing too few seats
<$A> Public hospitals can't cope with the normal demands needed by a population which is much too large for the facilities and funding levels assigned to it Too many of the people swelling Nairobi's population are dependants or <-/destitutes> whose major characteristic is the inability to contribute economically
<$B> We experience city growth in the form of rising crime rate <O/> theft and violence epidemic Just as young girls are forced into subsistence prostitution so do young men tend to a life of subsistence crime Just as our health services are becoming swamped by a combination of too many patients and too few tax contributors so too are police forces being swamped by too many crimes and too little resources
<$A> Those with many tend to evade taxes and invest directly in their own private security Platoons of private guards packs of dangerous dogs steel gates barbed wire radio alarms electric fences and bodyguards
<$B> The poor are resigned to be robbed from time to time Ordinary Nairobi residents don't carry large amounts of money hide their jewellery and keep a low profile Taxi-drivers hide a heavy spanner or similar weapon under their seats and often carry a friend at night for protection Respectable women disappear from public places by eight p m Only very desperate ladies and hardened delinquent girls walk with great risks on the Nairobi streets at night We see the expansion of the City in the <./>nu number of beggars and particularly children on the streets The few regular cripples who had their well-known static positions on Government Road or Saddler Street have been replaced by fast-moving packs of children and equally mobile young men and mothers with babies Motorists frequently jump red traffic lights at night to avoid stopping in the town In the daytime motorists at junctions keep their windows up and their doors locked It's a good time to be selling car air-conditioners It's a bad time to be an Aids orphan
<$A> Those which children experience Nairobi's phenomenal growth in the decline of the quality of the overcrowded poorly funded state schools and the shortage of places available in mission and other subsidised schools The rapid expansion of private schools reflects the public's dissatisfaction with the state education system
<$B> In secondary and tertiary education the situation is even more acute The universities in Nairobi are now so overcrowded that teaching standards are falling Hostels no longer provide conditions to which students can study efficiently
<$A> Other city services are creaking badly or have more or less failed as a result of the rapid and unregulated expansion of the city Garbage collection and disposal for example is not keeping pace with garbage production
<$B> Many of the recent peripheral housing developments are not yet connected to piped water supplies and water pressures are now regularly too low to deliver water to all householders
<$A> Roads are gradually becoming potholes to the stage of being dangerous to users Drains are incapable of handling the normal rainfall patterns and less than one third of the streetlights actually work
<$B> Housing is in short supply and is too expensive for many residents Much of the housing stock appears to be controlled by profiteering landlords who show no restraint in hiking rents and evicting families self-help houses construction groups have been set up with the assistance of NGOs to build affordable houses but too many residents still live in shanties in the open or have to share very overcrowded rooms
<$A> We see the expansion of a city in the growth of what is called the informal sector and the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> artisans Open spaces are filled with kiosks and petty trading activities Kiosks in the suburbs sell anything small at more or less any time They are both a convenience and a problem It's convenient to get milk and bread outside the gate but it's a problem if your property value goes down because there is a street of kiosks lined up along your garden fence It's a problem if the kiosks are noisy at night if waste paper litters your entrance if kiosk operators carry out off-duty thefts Kiosks are unplanned and lack water electricity and sanitation but they do provide a living for poor unskilled and unemployed people The kiosk problem is one which requires an intelligent and humane solution Rigid enforcement of planning and zoning regulations which may have been suitable for a town like Oxford in England but which have little relevance for the rapidly-growing capital city of Kenya is not certainly the answer
<$B> The informal sector expansion has turned road junctions into paper-shops Magazines and framed pictures key-rings and toys are now available as you wait for the light to turn red As the traffic gets heavier and the informal sector grows we can anticipate the ultimate one-stop mobile shopping experience Nigeria-style There will be tea and cakes manicure and hairdressing household goods and car-washing
<$A> The informal sector has already more or less replaced the city counsellors as collectors of parking revenue in many parts of Nairobi Motorists have regular parking attendants who protect the car clean and wash it move it to empty bays and their service actually equals the car's valeting services of Beverly Hills
<$B> Informal sector snacks and meal services provide affordable food for city workers and residents of estates With no rates no rents no living no VAT and no taxes it's not surprising that the kiosk snack has become a critical part of the poor man's life support system In many cities in the Third World these meat restaurants provide by far the best food at a <-/>a fraction of the cost of a restaurant meal Nairobi is fast catching up and kiosk night-out with a distinctive Nairobi cuisine is probably just round the corner
<$A> Your <ea/>Kali car repairs and servicing are now a familiar sight in Nairobi Everyone knows where he can go and get a bit of quick welding to that failing exhaust system That tail of motorists buying back their own stolen wing-mirrors or wheel-hubs from <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> mechanics are common
<$B> Any shade tree can become an informal sector barber's shop and on a sunny day who wants to sit inside and pay through the nose
<$A> The alleys and lanes of Nairobi City Centre and some of the wider pavements are clogged with traders selling curios cheap jewellery ties shoes handkerchiefs cosmetics pens matches cigarettes and almost anything small which could have fallen off the back of a lorry or pilfered through the factory fence Their prices are as keen as their eyesight which enables them to keep ahead of the city <O/>
<$B> Traders with vehicles or barrows have set up informal vegetable and fruit market at strategic points to catch commuters The <ea/>Mamamboga appears to be waging a winner war against the Council Their vegetables are fresh and cheap And the benefits for local farmers in cutting out middlemen and avoiding regular market overheads and taxes seem to be irresistible These informal vegetable-sellers are following the honourable traditions of London's thieves and barrel boys and Bangkok's floating wet markets A novel and menacing informal sector activity is road repair

<$A> This cover essentially introduces the idea of the book that women and environment are partners which affect each other differently in which case they have to coexist How this interaction is to take place is covered in the nine essays by Kenyan academic women namely Tabitha Kanogo Wanjiku <?/>Jiuri Akinyi Nzioki Janien Sakkasiani Wanjiku Kabira Mary Omosa Grace Sani Lucia Omondi Janet Kabeberi Macharia and Maria Nsomo
They write about women as they relate to the environment physically artistically historically linguistically and legally
Tabitha Kanogo sets the ball rolling in the very first essay titled Women and Environment in History She looks at the land use patterns in Africa in the pre-colonial and the colonial periods Writing about the pre-colonial period Kanogo contents that shifting cultivation was neither <-/hyposite> nor unscientific because there was an intimate knowledge of soil types and their sustainability for different crops This type of knowledge was mainly held by women who were the family cultivators of the land She writes and I quote <quote_><quote/> Tabitha's train of argument is that shifting cultivation afforded women a larger say in the management of land This say she states was taken away by the colonial structure which redefined land tenure dispossessed the women and set the stage for environmental degradation This was particularly so with the onset of cash crop farming On this Kanogo writes and I quote <quote_><quote/> end of quote She concludes that land shortage led to cultivation of marginal areas such as slopes which portrayed women as land miners insensitive to or unwilling to adopt improved methods of agriculture
Wanjiku <?/>Jiuri and Akinyi Nzioki take a similar stand that women cannot avoid being seen as the perpetrators of environmental degradation In the essay Invisible Managers of Natural Resources the two argue that women are the traditional providers of food water and firewood All from the natural resources of the God-given environment But they are severely inhibited in the proper management of this environment by legal structural and cultural constraints Moreover imagined problems like pollution make it more difficult for women to supply clean water and vegetables which suffer from both atmospheric and soil pollution They capture the helplessness of the woman when they write and I quote <quote_><quote/> End of quote
That looks like a pretty hopeless situation What is there to be done There are three essays in the collection which give us an inkling as to what needs to be done now that we have lost the past and its regulatory practices One of these is Story-tellers and Environment by Wanjiku Mukabi Kabira Using specific narratives Wanjiku illustrates the fact that the society's oral literature plays a very important role in the understanding of the environment and points to means and ways of its preservation The stories introduce us to the fauna and flora in our surroundings enlighten us on the harm done to these by natural calamities such as drought and by man and asks several questions to sensitise us to environmental matters If we come across certain names of animals and plants in the stories for example can policy workers determine whether these animals and plants still exist Can they be rehabilitated Can they be protected Kabera concludes in the essay that artists are sensitive needles in the society What they say observe and record can be used to reconstruct rehabilitate and preserve the environment she writes
The second essay about what can be done is Kabeberi Macharia's Women and Environmental Law in Kenya Kabeberi starts by discussing the various acts dealing with environment She therefore talks about acts on water forests settlement urbanisation and agriculture Then she turns to the crucial question as to whether the pieces of legislation address themselves to gender as a factor in environmental management Her conclusion is to the negative and she explains <quote_><quote/> She writes <quote_><quote/> End of quote Her suggestion is that the laws be amended to recognise the role of women in environmental management In doing this women must be actively involved she argues
Then comes Maria Nsomo who has been known to be quite strident about issues affecting women in the recent past Nsomo looks at policy impacts on women and environment She <?/>cites that until recently women have been the forgotten factor in environmental policies in Kenya as they have been in many other areas Apart from the fact that women feel the brunt of environmental degradation and are likely to be its greatest perpetrators Nsomo also sees that they are also the most affected by any economic austerity measures like the structural adjustment programme She therefore talks of a policy restructuring to address the imbalances in the allocation of recognition and responsibility to women with regard to the environment First she suggests that women be involved in decision-making processes at all levels Second she feels that policy makers should consider the plight of poor women whose depravity will reflect badly on the state of the environment Third she suggests that all women's groups involved in conservation work should be aided by the government both materially and morally She also pleads that affirmative action be directed to the food sector and that environmental awareness be promoted at all costs
The other three essays in the book are based on case studies of women in soil and water conservation in Kitui energy in Bura irrigation scheme and the role of language in agriculture in Siaya District Factually speaking this collection of essays comes in at the right time and addresses a very relevant issue It is the first attempt to consolidate scholarly work on the role of women in environmental management in Kenya and is directed at policy makers researchers and students Although that relevance cannot be gainsaid a number of the essays included seem like they were written for other forums but have now been adopted to fit environmental concerns and women But the majority read well and carry statistics which augment the arguments advanced <Name/> <?/>Sakkasani the editor of the book is a senior lecturer and acting director of the population studies and research institute at the University of Nairobi She is widely published in matters of migration including refugee movement in Africa fertility family planning and gender issues She specialises in social demography and has done commissioned research for leading international as well as national organisations In compiling this book she joins Anna P Obura the author of Changing Images and Wanjiku Kabira Muthoni Karega and Elizabeth Nsioki of Our Secret Lives in articulating the needs of women in modern times
And on that note listener we come to the end of Books and Bookmen today In today's programme we looked at Groundrock - African Women as Environmental Managers edited by <name/> <?/>Sakkasani and published by Acts Press in nineteen ninety-two On behalf of the producer George Okore this is Okumba Miruka saying good-bye

<$A> This is culture talk A programme that focuses on modern trends in all cultural and ethical development In today's programme we focus on the population crisis in our society today There are very many people in our society who are in deep trouble with their extended families This trouble has a reason out of the fact that they not want to <O/> tradition and get as many children as their extended family wishes Indeed in some cultures in our society one needs to get many children in order to name all his or her relatives who might be dead or alive If one lives in an urban area and has only two children he's looked at by his less affluent brothers and sisters uncles mother and father as lost To these people who encourage large families the point is children provide security at old age Secondly they are a form of wealth You will hear them boasting in rural bus that they have large families and that they are tougher than the educated who fear to get children A large family is therefore a source of pride so to speak Even if the children won't make it or are malnourished this is not a serious point to consider The question that one <O/> one to us is how shall we provide jobs for all these people who need to work How shall we insure provision of adequate basic needs for instance housing education and food For a pure <O/> cause how shall we initiate and carry out media-economic development projects when the gains are offset often before we can even prepare by having to be divided among an ever larger number of people Indeed the social and ecological impacts of overpopulation are serious wherever they occur I am aware of the fact that there exists a heated debate among experts about whether or not the world can produce an adequate amount of food to feed its population What is not debatable however is that large numbers of people are not now being adequately fed Most of the world's hungry live in the non-industrialised countries such as ours Incidentally many of the African countries cannot produce enough food to feed its people In a sense increasing numbers of people in such countries are being kept at the same inadequate level of nutrition The relationship between population and food supply is brought into focus when we realise that a little of one acre of farm land is required to produce the minimal amount of food each person requires Increasing the crop yield of each acre requires expensive tools and methods beyond the rich of most poor people And a <O/> like ours cannot simply afford the agricultural equipment and <O/> desperately needed As a result most of the ever increasing population must live with the pain of hunger on a daily business and enormously high rates of disease and death because of malnourishment In addition according to accepted economic thinking to raise the economic standard of its people a nation with a stable population must be able to invest between three and five per cent of its annual in new income producing development The whole population is growing at a rate of three per cent a year like ours An investment of up to twenty per cent of the national income is necessary before any raise in the nation's economic standard can take place It is important to realise that a population with a growth rate of three per cent a year doubles in only twenty-four years And it would acquire near miraculous import on the part of a nation for its economic development to even <O_><O/> with such population growth 
It should be understood that for an underdeveloped nation like ours we are simply struggling to achieve a bare subsistence level for most of our people Thus where as the industrialised nations are attempting to distribute more equitably their considerable national wealth and are <O/> to a substantial degree of population growth the underdeveloped nations such as Kenya are struggling simply to achieve a mere subsistence level for its people So when will our people understand family planning is necessary not only for individual development but also for national development Again one notices that women bear over eighty per cent of the burden of raising the children In many rural homes the women are malnourished and overworked because of successive pregnancies without proper medical care and food What is happening in our society is that the bread winner is struggling to support expanding families In most cases they are unskilled labourers who work at dawn to dark at low paying jobs in order to provide even their subsistence for themselves and their dependants And when drawn by rumours or bridges they move their families to the city where they find the pay more better and the cost of living is far higher than in the village they left In addition there are vast consequences of these production of more children than the society needs or can use carries over into the next generation To <O_><O/> property requires among other things education But a nation most of whose people have barely enough food to live can seldom build many schools or 
S2B034K
<$A> In this you know and because they know that society disapproves of the which of them some of them just <./>ex exclude themselves They don't even wait to be expelled from school It is you know inappropriate policies like these that we would wish to really get rid of and you know there it is on issues like these in the issues like legal uh status of women in various countries you find some in some countries there are still provisions within the law that discriminate against women When women know what other women in other countries have done to overcome such legal barriers then they are encouraged to tackle issues like that in their own countries
<$B> It is in such areas therefore that FEMNET assists non-government organisations to work together to focus on the overall need to insure the promotion of equal opportunities for women in society and their equal representation as both participants and beneficiaries in the development process However actions must be left at the national level
<$A> FEMNET would depend very very much on national women's organisations which are <-/interfiliate> in any one country What we try to affiliate are the uh umbrella organisations in any one country and it is these organisations with whom we share information about successful strategies that are being used the world over Africa in particular to overcome some of these problems So as I say as a regional organisation we provide information That is the most important thing We are very very much interested in keeping up-to-date with the latest research in any one field in the health of women for example to know how women you know really suffer <O/> have a backache The other woman has a backache but she has no time to go to any health institution to be attended That woman would take her child to the clinic but she'll not tell the doctor or the health personnel that she has a backache or she her knees are aching and so forth We're trying to activate women's organisations to really impress upon women that their health is very very important and that kind of information is best communicated by women's organisations because you know it's only the wearer of the shoe who knows where it pinches
<$B> There is a need for networking activities which promote focus on women's development as an issue which cuts across different areas of endeavour FEMNET therefore has the important role of assisting NGOs in collaborating and networking to improve the impact of their efforts in these different aspects of women's development
<$A> First of all because there's a lot that is happening the world over The one thing you will find women here in Kenya and in other African countries lack is awareness is information Women seem to have difficulty getting information about what is happening not only in their own countries but around the world also And their idea is that you know the women's decade will have lost its meaning completely if we allow that situation to continue As you know the women's decade came and went and many rural women even in the urban area did not know there was a women's decade and therefore their efforts to uplift their <O/> you know uh were undertaken in a kind of vacuum without that background of you know goals that had to be reached targets that had to be achieved and you know in <-/>in the absence of goals and targets you really don't perform well It's really keeping women in touch with you know where we are going like in a process of democratisation The women's organisations have really come up for the first time since independence and try to impress upon women and men that it is important for women for to begin to participate not merely as voters which they've always done but as participants in the democratisation process That freedom to express their views to express their priorities this is what we are really looking for And I'm delighted to tell you that it's happening everywhere not just here in Kenya in Zambia you know and in Tanzania everywhere Women are beginning to see that their vote is power and that they can use it to their own advantage We are saying elect women okay elect men that are gender sensitive and then when you bring issues let's say the priorities that you have these are the people that will be attending to them These are the people you are putting in the in decision-making process in Parliament
<$B> Dr <?/>Chachukia feels that the motivating factor for this awakening is the democratisation process
<$A> For once you have a situation where people are free to express their feelings I'm sure this <./>feel this thing was there even before okay but the <-/>the <-/>the <-/>the fact that you know women have gained awareness women have gained education in Kenya this is not a group that we are dealing with at independence The women at independence felt you know they had performed their role in freedom movement okay but they did not feel that they had a capacity to stand for election they did not feel that they had the capability of going to Parliament There were barriers that still exist for the ordinary woman like the language barrier for example you need to pass in <./>Ki Kiswahili and so forth but you know thirty years later they have educated their daughters and this is what they expect of them They expect them now to take up the mantle and express their needs and priorities better than any male parliamentarian has ever done We are not just talking about Parliament We are talking about the local authorities We are talking about the school committees the church committees Women have to become visible and it is you know that process of development then you know and a stage where they feel they are important that is where we have reached in nineteen ninety-two Women in Kenya need to aspire towards full and effective participation in the development of our country It is true that women in the rural areas participate effectively in agriculture They participate too much in fact because they are the farmers of this country They are the leaders in <-/>in the process of food production and cash crop production What we are saying is that <./>the they do need to be represented where decisions are made in a <-/corporative> movement at you know the co-operatives that are marketing what women are producing women's role should be effectively heard and as I say in all other sectors of life this is really what women should be aspiring towards Secondly women aspire for the best for their children and what women in Kenya must realise is that children mean all children both boys and girls and that women in Kenya really need to encourage and support their daughters so that you know they can reach the highest levels
<$B> The various NGOs under FEMNET have a focus of interest in terms of concern with different areas of social life Also the target group always includes women often a majority of women
<$A> Some NGOs are in education The church organisations for example have been very involved in education uh They identify areas that have been left behind like the remote areas of Kenya in Turkana in <name/> You'll find many of our churches are involved in the education in those areas They're involved in health in primary health care Again many non-government organisations which <O/> uh Kenya Medical Women Association and you'll find equivalents of these in other countries Some are specialised others are you know dealing in general programmes So being they <-/>they <-/>they look at what the issues are and they you know try and support women in those areas
<$B> One of FEMNET's themes is to create an infrastructure and channel through which NGOs will reach one another and share crucial information knowledge experiences and thereby sharpening and improving their inputs into Africa's development As the evaluation of the women's decade reviewed efforts in that separate development of women would not succeed
<$A> This was a result of you know scientific analyses evaluation research you know where you felt that you could not separate women from their communities from their households that any development had to take place within that context As a result many efforts that had been undertaken were really you know wasted in terms of for example income generation Many of the projects did not generate income The effort now is one of mainstreaming women's concerns in other words insuring that the mainstream addresses gender concerns in development The mainstream is government The mainstream is NGO So rather than looking at women's problems piecemeal what we would like to see is for each government sector whether it's information is that you tackle the needs of women in information It's not for NGO NGOs can only reinforce what the ministry does but the ministry has to sit down and really brainstorm on how to reach women So you got to find alternative ways of reaching out to those women So what we recommend for example to the Ministry of Information is to adopt a multi-strategy for reaching women within <O/> communication and so forth Otherwise they'll be missing out and they'll continue to miss out on important things that are happening in our country The same challenge goes to the Minister of Agriculture Let us not confine women's participation in agriculture to the home science division home economics division in the Ministry because women are involved in all aspects of agriculture and food production and that when an extension officer goes out in the rural areas this is the farmer that he or she is looking for
<$B> One of the ongoing activities of FEMNET is gender sensitisation This is done through seminars where various gender roles are analysed in order to integrate them fully in future development
<$A> We have worked with planning officers We have worked with researchers We have worked with the <-/>the development uh uh extension officers and you know having gone through this system of analysing gender roles what men do what women do and trying to strengthen them within these roles and trying to help them to change some of the social attitudes towards certain roles and so forth you certainly create a more just society You know gender sensitisation is all about rewrite democratisation is all about social justice you know really making sure that everybody has opportunities and that you know there is co-operation <./>with within the society Information dissemination is our one of our crucial uh roles that as an organisation we try to share information that may not be available to the ordinary woman and we ask NGOs to take this information and use it in the way they want it and translate it into local languages They can rewrite those articles that are more relevant to you know groups and women in their own countries uh uh and so and so forth This is the kind of thing we have been trying to do We have tried in this process We've also tried to establish a documentation centre because women you know information on women is scattered all over the place You find more publications on women in Europe and America you know rather than in Africa So what we are trying to do is put together packages of information that's important on women's health on women's education women in decision-making and so on and so forth

<$A> This is Point of Interest a <ea_>Biblia Husema<ea/> programme for Kenya Broadcasting Corporation Nairobi This is your Christian magazine programme that brings you issues views and interviews I am Pastor Simon Mohota Welcome Our point of interest today is about why man needs salvation why man needs salvation But before we get to that good point we have music here by the Urbanines from Nairobi In The Fullness of Time That is our own The Urbanines from Nairobi with their number In the Fullness of Time Yes our people are coming up We praise the Lord for them that they're singing for the Lord with such good voices May God bless you The Urbanines from Nairobi Let's ask ourselves this question why do man need salvation Why do man need salvation Have you ever thought why you are or what you are by nature You know that there are people who look very innocent don't you I agree that probably you out there you're very innocent You never steal You never kill You never lie and before people when people judge you they give you eighty-five per cent or ninety-five per cent because after all no-one is perfect only Christ as man was perfect But have you ever thought what you are before God or what you are by nature Our point of interest today is about why man needs salvation Man needs salvation simply because man is a sinner Salvation simply means to accept the Lord Jesus Christ as our personal saviour And maybe you are saying Come off it Pastor I am not so bad But you know to me you look good because I cannot see you beyond your face or body But God has x-rayed the human heart and has given us the picture He shows us what he finds in us all The findings are so terrible they cannot be read in a mixed audience But remember this is a picture of us that God sees I know your picture is there because it says There is none that does good no not one Have you heard of someone who has been to hospital He had pains probably in the stomach or chest pains Then the doctor orders an x-ray to be taken And when it's taken the doctor reads the x-ray and finds that you have a stomach cancer or biopsy shows surely you have it You see the patient may say I don't have it or maybe it is a different disease But his doubts will not change the fact that he or she has cancer There was an old man who was told that he has Aids after the blood-test When he was told he said Does Aids come with wind His objection did not change anything He still remained an Aids-patient When you read the Book of Romans you find in the first three chapters the picture of man without God In Romans chapter three you will believe then that the natural heart is desperately wicked Let me ask you a question Have you asked the Holy Spirit to throw <-/>a such light on your own heart If you have you know today that you will need a saviour God in the Book of Romans presents a court-room scene God the judge of all the earth summons Jews and Gentiles before the Bar of Justice Prisoner after prisoner is brought up The general charge is stated All under is sin Both the Gentiles and Jews are given the opportunity for hearing Their special pleas of not-guilty are carefully considered and answered clearing the way for the final verdict from the judge Finally the judge pronounces the verdict All the world guilty before God If this were today newspapers every word would blaze this headline all the television newsmen would be announcing it Can't you hear them All the world found guilty Against all this there is no defence The judge says Is there anyone to plea the cause of the prisoner and there is no answering voice Every mouth is stopped There is no room for excuse The condemnation of the world is settled But praise the Lord that is not the end of the matter The same God reveals the plan of salvation to save a lost world At this juncture just because God is revealing his plan to save the lost world don't say After all God is love he will not condemn me Listen to God's word The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness Remember he has already passed sentence on everyone All guilty There is no chance of appeal It is a decision of the Supreme Court of the universe because sin is universal all have sinned Hence we need a world's saviour And because God is good and he's a God of love he has provided just this one the saviour of the world Read with me John Chapter three verse sixteen 
The judge on the bench says Is there anyone to appear for the prisoners Then the son of man the son of God says Yes I'm here to represent these men and women It is true they have committed these sins It is true that they are guilty But I bore their guilt on the cross I died in their place that they might go free I'm their righteousness and the judge sets them free
Praise the Lord brothers and sisters Christ not only saves us from the penalty of sin but he is able to free us from the consciousness of guilt and the power of sin Next week we'll talk about how to become a Christian or how to be born again Till then God bless you

<$A> This is Point of Interest a <ea_>Biblia Husema<ea/> studio's programme for Kenya Broadcasting Corporation Nairobi This is your Christian magazine programme that brings you issues views and interviews I am Pastor Simon Mohota your presenter welcome Today in point of interest we are discussing how to become a Christian or in other words how to be born again but before that let's get good music Yes that was Randy Stonehill with the number Even the Best of Friends Last week we talked about what we are by nature and the conclusion was that man and of course woman is a sinner who has been proven guilty and has pleaded guilty We saw that what awaits man is death because the wages of sin is death The judge on the bench says Is there anyone to appear for these prisoners Then the Son of God says Yes I'm here to represent these men and women It is true that they committed these sins It is true that they are guilty but I bore their guilt on the cross I died in their place that they might go free So how does God save sinners or how can one become a believer or a Christian born again The answer is through redemption in Christ Jesus When God looks at us he sees no righteousness but when he looks at us in Christ he does not see any <-/inprovent> but perfection He does not see an improvement but perfection For God sees only his own righteousness Jesus Christ Praise the Lord that a sinful man like me a sinner by nature who cannot have his own righteousness is made righteous I can't help but say Praise be to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who made this possible How to be a Christian or to be born again is to realise that first though you don't do many terrible things that men can term a sin like adultery bribery murdering cheating or any other form of corruption you are a sinner by nature Your heart mind and soul without Christ is always hostile to the things of God Man is always in rebellion against God Because of that man has been alienated from God and no matter what man does he cannot fellowship with God his maker And that is without Christ Secondly you have to know or realise that you cannot bridge or bridge the gap and you cannot save yourself You need Christ When Christ died on the cross he said It is finished That means through Christ by faith we can now talk to God our Father unlike in the Old Testament when men had to go through a priest Today we are privileged to have a great high priest who did not take a lamb from us but he himself was the lamb for us Remember the word of John or the words of John the Baptist when he saw Jesus coming He said in John Chapter one verse twenty-nine <quote_><quote/> In First John chapter one verse nine the Bible says <quote_><quote/> And in Relevation Chapter three verse twenty Jesus says <quote_><quote/> Remember brother and sister the handle to open the door is on your side It all depends on you whether you'll open the door or not Jesus will not bulldoze you to accept him Jesus is a gentleman He wants you to decide by your own He cannot force you or he cannot face force his way in or use force He's able to do that and he can use any means to bring you to your knees but Jesus is humble and patient He is waiting for you patiently to open the door for him so that he will come into your hut and be your friend and helper He also wants you to know that through him because of your faith in him you are regarded as if you never sinned That is in theological terms you are justified Everything that Christ has done has been credited to your account His righteousness is <./>you is yours When Christ's righteousness is reckoned as ours this is called justification A man made just righteous before God The just shall live by faith the Bible says A man is not made just by his works but by believing on Christ Today we have what I may term traditional Christianity Somebody thinks because my parents are Christians or they're church elders deacons or Mothers Union or Guild or many other positions in the church or maybe you sing in the choir you teach Sunday school or any other work you say then surely I'm a Christian My friend these are all good works but unfortunately they will not take you anywhere you'll be told by the <./>lo

<$A> Besides the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> artisan can even go further and use recycled material like making the wheelbarrow base with a metal sheet from a huge drum Precision products like weighing-machines have always been the domain of high-tech industries Not any more The <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> entrepreneurs have mastered the art Just like they can <O/> by <O/> as Mr <name/> explained to us 
The <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> enjoy another advantage They are able to cut a lot of unnecessary overheads BET Chairman Dr <name/> took a moment to explain why they deserve to be supported 
<$B> We believe that <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> are promoting the informal sector through this exhibition They do not only <-/>only make their own noble contribution but also complement and supplement its efforts in achieving the prime objective for industrialisation by localisation and with creating a climate of security in this country
<$A> High quality shiny and strong <?/>kareems from a <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> foundry There are the high level technology that was also exhibited by a welding machine which has been completely manufactured by a <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> artisan The abilities of the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> could be seen in these two lorries of the same age one of which has been reconditioned by a <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> garage with great results Apart from repairs which is their home task the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> can be very inventive Big trailers some of which you see on our roads are not from the big multi-national trailer-makers only Some have completely been manufactured by the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> artisans This is a living example These bicycles and tricycles work even though the frames are square and maybe too heavy But a bicycle like this one has some advantages The tyres are definitely puncture proof With some adaptation and borrowing of technology some of the bicycles are quite acceptable and definitely attractive to buy because the price tag was half of what it would cost if it originated from one of the big industries
<$C> I find that a <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> clock <O/> my clock are equivalent to one minute of the normal watches or the normal clocks
<$A> A clock which works by using a drop-of-water technique and its carried water container some tin and some little <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> magic and presso you have the clock
Then there was the home-made organ instrument With some improvement this could definitely help those children studying music in the eight-four-four system 
<$D> ... this particular tool here is a <-/>a home-made piano as I call it I designed and created it all myself I programmed it in a way that's then it can be used like any other uh key-board instrument 
<$A> The works of <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> <name/> looks a bit crude but it can work It was made by a standard A pupil who could not demonstrate it to us because he had gone to sit his standard A examinations Obviously these innovations need some improvement and there would be wider issues like marketability and standardisation to be dealt with Those are some of the matters being discussed at the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> symposium which brought together the artisans and specialists from various disciplines to deliberate the matters affecting this important sector All over the world at the Ivory Towers like the World Bank Offices in New York and other capitals of the world there are volumes of books research papers and recommendations for improving the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> sector or the informal sector But all the intellectual material has on most occasions been simply overtaken by the spontaneous vitality of this sector The <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> sector vibrates in harmony with its atmosphere It quickly adjusts to new situations in a given market place In Kenya it is fast taking its place in our industrial sector Look at this wood quality furniture Good enough to furnish the office of a minister And indeed Minister Professor <name/>'s office is <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> furnished So when Professor <name/> says he supports the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> sector he is practical about it too He had some good remarks on <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> sector 
We also talked to a <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> practitioner This time a lady Margaret <name/> the former secretary who now welds and makes this type of furniture and she spoke for other <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> people on the value of this exhibition
<$E> Especially for this exhibition I find it works It is also giving us courage uh and it has also given us contact because since I came I've been contacted by several people They've also placed some orders especially for desk repairs for schools and some offices I find it a benefit if there was more exhibition of the kind to be held
<$A> Margaret proudly displays to us her version of a sofa bed This sofa bed worked so well and effectively that the only bad thing about it was that it is not copy-righted Does she have any regrets for having left the secretarial desk and stepped out into the span of the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> sector Not at all
<$E> I prefer now the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> because I control myself and then if I don't get anything for the day I don't mind I call it a day But when I can I get a lot more 
<$A> You think you get more money of the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> than you can get as a secretary 
<$E> I suppose so Although it comes at times not all but it is better than being a secretary 
<$A> What is the main problem in this business
<$E> The main problem is market Marketing your uh items 
<$A> The excellence of the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> sector in making bags and shoes was another impressive feature The bags and the ladies' shoes were as cute as those imported from Taiwan and probably stronger than the versions from those far-Eastern countries As for the shoes there was no doubt that they are strong and practical for those who wish to buy shoes only once in a while and that is the majority of us When one realises that even a multi-national shoe company like Bata does it all from one small family shop in a village in Europe for this keen old man the sky could also be the limit for his shoe enterprise President Moi had compliments for the organisers of the exhibition which helped in efforts to put to the core the importance of this informal sector 
<$F> Exhibitions of this measure require a substantial amount of resources both financial and human I am therefore glad that like the previous events <O/> BET has once again offered to meet a substantial extent of the costs of this exhibition This is a practical demonstration of the spirit of <ea/>harambee and a good example of the willingness of the private sector to join hands with government in developing our economy What we are witnessing today would not have been possible without your moral technical and financial support Thank you very much 
<$A> The exhibition was also a tribute to these hard-working men and women those who often literally sweat under the heat of the sun to make an honest living and yet even as they make high-quality items like this bed there still face the problem of marketing Piles and piles of their products not getting sold All the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> entrepreneurs we talked to have the problem of marketing For instance they display the clothes out in the open where there is a problem of sun and dust probably discolouring the fabrics Then they compete with products that come from the big industries However the victory of the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> all the carpenters tailors metal fabricators and the rest is that they are still competing surviving and slowly but steadily winning Hundreds of women win their livelihood by tailoring <Name/>'s dressmaking shop is one of them Many Kenyans in several fields of life have had some good education thanks to school fees paid by parents whose only trade is tailoring The head of the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> section in the Ministry of Technical Training and Applied Technology Mr <name/> was certainly encouraged by the exhibition
<$G> I'd say I'm quite satisfied with uh the show Firstly because no doubt we achieved our objectives 
<$A> What were your objectives 
<$G> We had set some objectives for this show One is to uh market these <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> products who are in want of marketing and also need some promotion of their products We also intended to bring <ea_>Jua Kalis<ea/> from different areas of the country so that they can exchange their experiences and ideas and learn from each other From what we have already observed we are satisfied that it was a <-/>a worthwhile exercise 
<$A> The creativity of the sector was displayed in such peculiar trades like this one of making rings bracelets and hairpieces from cow horns This foreign exchange earnings from this cow horn enterprise 
<$H> This is uh a hairclip This is made of uh from cow horn Now we have <-/>we <-/>have them in different kind of designs We have that shape and then we have another shape which is uh we call it uh heart shape uh that one where you just pull it up and put up the hair knot it up some and then put it up there and then all you have to do is knot it up with a pin 
<$A> There is also foreign exchange earnings and a lot of livelihoods dependent on thisindustry The women's craft is really a <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> sector even though they often work under the shelter of their homes

<$A> In this case the preparation can be done financially by saving and keeping aside a little money every month to make it easy to buy whatever will be necessary when the baby comes
<$B> The essential items can be divided into four groups namely the layette or baby's cloth and articles bathing items and toilet accessories sleeping place or cot and feeding equipment It is worthwhile remembering that these essential items must be suitable for a young baby and should be selected carefully Let us now discuss each group at a time
<$A> The layette means articles of clothing needed by the baby These should be made or bought by the mother When selecting articles of clothing these points should be observed One the material used should be soft warm washable long lasting absorbent and light in weight Two the style used for garments should be simple and should allow for easy putting on and taking off of the garment Choose attractive styles Three the garments should have suitable opening for easy wearing They should be loosely fitting with wide hems to allow for growth Four the fasteners selected should not be hard such as zips and big buttons use tapes press-studs elastic and tiny buttons which do not press hard on baby's skin Five the material should have small design and should be of good fast colour to suit the small baby and six the articles made or bought should be adequate because the baby has to be changed to clean clothes often during the day Can you tell us what is included in the layette
<$B> Yes these articles include napkins These can be made of muslin towelling or disposable materials You should have at least twenty-four of these napkins or more for cold weather The baby should be changed as soon as he is wet to prevent skin rashes and bad smell You also need three to four vests both cross-over style or ordinary but suitable in size and petticoats for girls Sweaters three to four including cardigans Three to four matinee coats to be worn on top of vests or dresses Three to four pairs of booties These are used to keep baby's feet warm Outer garments dresses shirts rompers tunics suits and others This should be adequate for daily wear and changing when necessary Bibs to be used when feeding the baby Buy two to three of these Plastic pants Cap or bonnet to cover the head when it is cold Mittens or gloves two pairs to be used when it is cold Two to three baby shawls and safety pins for fastening of napkins about half a dozen
<$A> Let's now consider the bathing items and toilet accessories As you know the baby must be given a bath daily to keep her or him cool and clean You need to buy the following items in advance A basin or <ea/><O/> a plastic basin is better than <ea/><O/> because it is easy to keep clean and does not rust It is used to hold water for the bath You should also buy a bucket or large <ea/>sufuria for putting in water A bucket with a lid for putting in soiled clothes These should be soaked and washed well immediately Soft towel for drying the body of the baby A baby soap and buy one which can be afforded Baby oil lotion or jelly to apply on the skin As for the baby powder buy one of good quality and use it on the under-arm and between legs to dry off the moisture after bath Cotton wool and buds Use these when cleaning baby's ears nose and eyes A small bowl or cup of warm or cold boiled water for bathing the face of the young baby especially the eyes Dettol to use in the washing water to guard against infection A hairbrush and a comb Baby's potty or chamber to train the baby in the good habit of emptying his bowels in a clean manner This can be made of plastic enamel or aluminium and lastly a nail cutter or small scissors to trim the baby's nails 
<$B> Let us now discuss the sleeping place for the baby It is important that the baby has enough sleep in a quiet warm and well ventilated room At early stages the baby will sleep most of the time He must have a comfortable place to sleep in Some mothers prefer sleeping with the baby but if possible the baby should have his or her own cot which is comfortable and safe to sleep in without the danger of falling There are different types of cots in the market and one should buy what one can afford The cot should be firm comfortable durable and of the correct size Examples of cots are basket wooden canvas metal and pram cots What are the items needed for the cot
<$A> You need to have a firm soft mattress to fit the cot Cot blankets and sheets should also be made available A mackintosh should be bought to prevent the baby wetting the sheets and the blankets This can be made of rubber or plastic The cot should have a mosquito net to cover the baby so that the insects do not disturb him or her when asleep A bed-cover can also be made available to make the cot look neat and attractive
<$B> Finally let us discuss feeding equipment For a young baby one needs few items because one should breastfeed the baby as much as possible However there are times when you have to feed the baby with soup porridge fruit juice water and other suitable foods for his or her age The following items should be made available A cup and a spoon Buy suitable size A small bowl or a plate thermoflask to keep water hot a large plastic bowl or <ea/>sufuria with a lid for storing and sterilising items in A measuring cup or jug a small <ea/>sufuria for boiling water or milk All these items should be selected carefully Buy good quality items which are easy to keep clean Clean them well and sterilise them by using Milton solution or boiling those ones which are made of unbreakable materials Is there any special point to remember on the items I've just mentioned
<$A> Yes I'd like to add that all baby's items should be kept clean and fresh all the time Clothes sheets and towels must be washed often dried in the sun and ironed Towels and vests can be boiled occasionally to kill germs or parasites Napkins should be bleached to keep them white
<$B> Let us now summarise our lesson We have discussed the necessary preparation an expectant mother needs to do before the baby is born Remember these points One make or buy baby's garment and articles early enough to avoid rush at the last minute Two make sure that bathing and feeding items are also bought Three if the baby is to be born at the hospital make sure that you have hospital fees Four make sure that you know who will look after the family when you are at the hospital Five prepare the members of the family for the new baby and six if you have to give birth at home make sure that you have all the necessary items and a qualified person to help you when delivering

<$A> The English service presents Viewpoint a programme that focuses on issues and contradictions arising from sciences experiences ideas and matters of particular or general interest Our speaker today is Professor Joseph Njasani Principal of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences and Professor of Philosophy University of Nairobi
<$B> Today I would like to speak to you about a very very perennial and living issue in philosophy known as the problem of mind and body And when we speak of mind a lot of philosophers have devoted a lot of time trying to see to understand to discern the meaning of mind A philosopher like H D Lewis has written a book known as the elusive mind and is trying to elaborate to expose the intricate problem of the relationship between mind and body History of philosophy I can say that no issue has been debated so uncompromisingly as the question of mind and therefore by implication consciousness There does seem to be justifiable grounds for this uncompromising debate One the mind is such an elusive thing in that we are completely unable to say with certainty where precisely it is located in the human body All the classical theories on mind like those of Plato and Aristotle that locate the soul either in the heart or in the brain and even the Cartesian or Descartes' theory of the pineal gland as the seat of the mind have been accepted with a lot of scepticism in modern contemporary philosophical speculations For the human soul is probably neither located in the pineal gland nor in the heart as Aristotle thought It is probably everywhere in the human organism in the same intensity and in the same assertiveness on the level of consciousness Of course some parts of the body may appear to be more vulnerable or less vulnerable in the preservation or loss of consciousness That not with the standing it should not mean that the soul is at least or more distributed in those parts or shall I say it should not mean that the soul is less or more distributed in those parts For vulnerability or even the organ that seemingly contains the vulnerable substance are two separate things The container of the substance only happens to be crucial to the maintenance or disturbance of the equilibrium but it cannot be the equilibrium itself We know that upon a total damage of the brain or a total shattering of the heart the soul departs or vanishes It does so not in bits and pieces but as a total principal life now withdrawn This in itself seems to suggest that the soul as a substance is indivisible and evenly distributed throughout the body Were that not to be the case then it should at least be the case that death would be a very gradual and unending process that stretches out in the life span of the physical disintegration of the millions of atoms in the human body Indeed death would be in piecemeal It would probably mean that once the head is fatally ruptured the rest of the body would continue to live Instead that is not the case For once the fatal blow has been delivered the soul departs at once and as a totality However it may be asked and this is the question I'm going to address myself in our coming uh episode Why does man and the soul by implication continue to subsist or to survive even after dismembering a person

<$A> Hello and welcome to yet another edition of Your Security in Old Age brought to you by National Social Security Fund in conjunction with the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation Last week in Your Security in Old Age we answered some of the questions we have been receiving from members of the Fund Tonight we shall start off by reminding members and the public in general about the historical development of the fund its objectives policies and operations among its members But before that here is a message from the sponsors 
<$B> Do you know that it's against the law to have employees who are not registered as members of the National Social Security Fund Do you also know that it's against the law not to remit or delay members' contributions Make sure that you remit your employees' contributions in time National Social Security Fund Your security in old age <$A> It did not take long after independence for Kenyans in various spheres of leadership including the government parliament and trade union movements to realise that the majority of Kenyan workers did not have anything to look forward to on retirement Workers employed by the private sector had not formally recognised social schemes to cater for their social protection Therefore necessary steps were taken and the NSSF was established in nineteen sixty-five by an Act of Parliament Initially the NSSF operated as a department of the Ministry of Labour However by the nineteen eighties it had become a fairly complex organisation and in nineteen eighty-eight was transformed into a state corporation The fund's policy is formulated by the Board of Trustees The Board of Trustees comprises of workers' representatives from Kotu employers' representatives from the Federation of Kenyan Employers that is FKE and government representatives In formulating the fund's policies the Board of Trustees acts strictly in accordance with the NSSF Act The Board delegates the day-to-day management of the fund to the managing trustee who also serves as the chief executive of the NSSF In managing the affairs of the fund the managing trustee places the best interest of the members above all other considerations Membership to the fund is compulsory through your employer Every employer is required to register himself and his employees Employers with at least five employees on their payroll are required to submit monthly contributions to the fund Any employer who fails to register with the fund or fails to register their workers within twenty-one days after employment is guilty of an offence and liable for prosecution in a court of law The fund has a team of inspectors stationed in different parts of the country who ensure that employers comply with the provisions of the NSSF Act But before we continue the programme let us take a short break with the number I need you by BVSMP A number of you have written to us wondering what happens to your membership when you change employment You can only be registered once as a member of the fund during your working life Your membership number is your account number which you must quote in all correspondence or inquiries regarding your statement of account Your membership number remains the same even when you change employers In case you lose your job or become self-employed you remain a member of the fund even when no contributions are forthcoming to your account What's more your early savings continue to earn interests until you qualify to withdraw your benefits An employee is automatically exempted from the fund membership if he or she is working for either the government or the local authorities and is under pensionable terms or if he or she is working for an employer like a parastatal offering pension benefits under any scheme approved by the Minister for Labour in writing Others who are exempted from the fund membership are the armed forces the prison service administration police or national aid service Also an employer who qualifies for exemption under international conventions the public universities where your pension is covered by the super-annuation scheme or if you're undergoing full-time instruction in school college university and so on and you happen to be on vacation employment any payment in the form of allowances shall not be construed to be a wage Before we wind up tonight's programme we have a letter from <name/> Abulala of PO Box four one six <name/> He tells us that he is a keen listener of both our English and Swahili radio programmes Abulala says he was working with a certain employer between nineteen eighty-four to nineteen ninety During this period he was receiving dockets but since then he has not received anything to that effect He is therefore asking for a statement showing his contributions Well Mr Abulala we're pleased to know that you are a keen listener of our radio programmes We urge other members to tune in on Tuesdays at eight forty-five p m for the Swahili programme <name/> NSSF and Friday at eight forty-five p m for the English programme Your Security in Old Age We assure you that you'll find both programmes very educative We would also like to inform our dear listeners that NSSF stopped issuing dockets What we issue now are statements and on request Mr Abulala your statement of account will soon be dispatched to you In case of any errors or omissions we'll be glad to offer further assistance <$B> Do you know that it's against the law to have employees who are not registered as members of the National Social Security Fund Do you also know that it's against the law not to remit or delay members' contributions Make sure that you remit your employees' contributions in time National Social Security Fund Your security in Old Age <$A> And with that listeners we've come to the end of this week's edition of Your Security in Old Age In case of any questions please write to us on PO Box seven zero four six zero Nairobi PO Box seven zero four six zero Nairobi This programme is brought to you by the National Social Security Fund in conjunction with the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation And until next week and on behalf of our producer <name/> this is your presenter <name/> saying goodbye

<$A> that it could be that research has shown that seventy per cent of migraine sufferers do not currently consult their doctors The survey also showed that among these fifty-three per cent of them are zero <-/consulters> that is they have given up hope on consulting doctors so these are quiet sufferers A possible <./>conse consequence of this is that doctors may be unaware of the full extent of the problem Another difficulty could be sufferers seldom or rarely consult their doctors when a migraine is actually in progress Doctors therefore have to interview sufferers about past events which they may not recall completely or accurately The other one could be or is there is no laboratory test for migraine and few effective diagnostic tools apart from <O/> taking are currently available And again migraine is not always easy to distinguish from other forms of headache With all those problems or difficulties facing the doctors notwithstanding therefore there have been a number of treatments that have been used for long time for many years and currently they are divided into two types The first class is only to treat the acute phase of the <-_>of the<-/> migraine attack and these drugs are given specifically to abort an attack or reduce the symptoms of the attack And the other class of drugs is a prophylactic or the preventive medication which is given specifically to prevent or to reduce the frequency of the attack We would like all listeners or those people who have this problem to consult their doctors on the specific medication they may be given because the medication as we've already said in this programme will depend or will vary according to the severity of the condition the condition itself and the type of patient or the patient himself So we won't mention the drugs that are given here suffice it to say that these drugs are given for two main reasons One is to abort an impending attack or reduce the symptoms of attack which is existing and the other type of drug is to prevent an attack or to reduce the frequency of attacks A vast area of different approaches not all pharmacological are used for the treatment of migraine However as none-drug therapies are unlikely to provide sufficient relief for many patients most are compelled to seek pharmacological or medical solutions As preventive drug treatment is reserved for those suffering frequent or severe migraine attacks and the risk of breakthrough attacks is quite high optimisation of acute treatment is of paramount importance However the wide variation in the approach of acute migraine treatment the differing modes of action of <-/>of the drugs used and the problem of side effects reflect the lack of a completely satisfactory therapy This highlights the need for an effective acute migraine treatment that has as a good side effect profile and a well-defined mechanism of action of migraine Now what are the causative factors of migraine No one knows why some individuals have migraines and others do not Certain factors are implicated in the answer to migraine however First group of factors are the predisposing ones or the predisposing factors Research has shown migraine to be a commoner or to be commoner in women than in men by a factor of about three to one The role of female productive hormones may explain this difference Secondly individuals with a family history of migraine are more likely to have migraines than those without So there could be <-/genetical> components in this aspect The other factors are ones we call the <-/precepitory> factors Evidence from both patients and doctors suggest that a wide variety of stresses can trigger migraine These could include strong emotions physical exertion changes in temperature for example when taking a hot bath intense sensual stimulation or <-/>or <-/stimulizers> such as bright or flickering light loud noises and unpleasant smells food and drink This could vary from cheese chocolates some fruits and some wines They have frequently been implicated and female productive hormone fluctuations such as those associated with menstruation or taking of contraceptives and changes in the weather especially from dry to humid conditions Little clinical evidence has been obtained to establish firmly any of the above <./>aspli <O/> factors but this may reflect difficulties in research rather than in <-/>in validity in the claims made There is also difficulty in distinguishing causes from effects For example we try to ascertain whether consumption of certain foods or drinks before migraine is responsible for triggering the migraine or there's a sort of a craving which is the onset Now how is or how can migraine be prevented The limited knowledge about the causes of migraine makes prevention a fairly difficult subject Nevertheless there're three main avenues that could be used or have been used with some success One is lifestyle changes that even though little is certain about precipitating factors most headache specialists work with their patients to try to identify and then if possible eliminate factors that can trigger attacks Successes are reported for example through eliminating particular foods or drinks from the diet and by reducing stress at home and at work Other complimentary techniques that may be used in prevention of migraine could be some taking some form of foods other conditions <O/> like homeopathy Others could be acupuncture which has claimed to be effective in some cases and some techniques that seek relaxation such as yoga massage meditation and bare feet bath can also be effective by reducing neck and other tension which could be a precipitating factor for migraine Again there is little scientific evidence to support the efficacy of these techniques It is important therefore that headache and migraine sufferers consult their doctors as medical research is now offering effective new medicines now currently available to combat this affliction <-/Migrainers> now need not suffer quietly as there is hope for the future Do consult your doctor

<$A> This is your weekly programme that takes a critical look at the world of books and their authors In this week's edition of the programme we focus on the late Eugene Ionesco of the Theatre of the Absurd Many Kenyans especially those who never studied literature at university level might never have heard of Eugene Ionesco Indeed ours is a society that has no reading culture and therefore very few writers are well known But <-_for> those who studied drama at university level and got interested in the Theatre of the Absurd do know Eugene Ionesco This is one writer whose ideas and dramatic experiments have continued to influence many writers and critics alive Eugene Ionesco who died early April at the age of eighty-five is perhaps one of the greatest writers within the absurd tradition This school of thought is associated with among others Samuel Beckett Arthur Adamov Jean Genet and Eugene Ionesco himself Whereas many people believe that the Theatre of the Absurd is elitist and confined to the narrow circle of intellectuals it however provides new ideas new approaches and a new vitalised philosophy which is aimed at transforming our modes of thought It is therefore necessary to see the Theatre of the Absurd as one genre that has eluded both the critics and readers alike While looking at the Theatre of the Absurd which Eugene Ionesco subscribed to it is notable that the presentation of the drama in this tradition is to some degree technically isolating in terms of language and style Isolating in the sense that very few people especially those schooled in the art of appreciating drama in its finest form do appreciate it By saying so we are not implying that traditional drama is by any chance inferior However good art communicates in images and symbols and that is what absurd drama does Incidentally only those well-schooled in the art of appreciating good drama respond positively to the Theatre of the Absurd We stand to be challenged Nevertheless with absurd drama the audience is presented with unconventional approach a complete departure from the norms It is common knowledge that people rarely welcome new ideas with both hands and this is what happened to the Theatre of the Absurd In nineteen-fifty for instance when Eugene Ionesco's play entitled The Bald Soprano opened in Paris there was no kind word for it Eugene's other play entitled The Lessons concluded after one night with the late actor bolting out ahead of spectators who were demanding for their money This was how serious it was for an audience to be presented with something extraordinary and incomprehensible However the audience slowly began to appreciate the Theatre of the Absurd and by nineteen-seventy the Roman-born Ionesco was elected to the pantheon of tradition in his society In fact his death early in April was announced by the Ministry of Culture in France and not by his wife Rodeka whom he stayed with for fifty-eight years Eugene Ionesco's drama presented the audience with completely different dramatic experiences Critics criticised them for lack of plot development characterisation suspense or plain common sense The absurd plays are normally dismissed as nonsense or mystifications Even in Kenya today absurd drama has really not been appreciated A good example of a play written in this tradition which is perhaps one of the greatest plays to have come from Kenya is Francis Mbuga's Game of Silence Despite being technically richer than other plays by the same author critics have not given it critical attention One fact that is true however is that plays written in this new convention when judged by the standards and criteria of traditional drama may be regarded as impertinent and outrageous That is if a good play should be judged by <O/> of characterisation and motivation These plays are however without recognisable characters and present the audience with almost mechanical puppets In the same vein they do not have fully explained theme which is neatly exposed and finally solved The absurd plays neither have a beginning nor an end traditionally speaking The absurd plays do not hold the mirror up to nature and portray manners and behaviour of the age in finely observed sketches Rather one finds reflections or dreams and nightmares In the absurd plays one does not find witty repertoire and pointed dialogue but more often one will encounter incoherent babblings Eugene Ionesco was therefore a representative of this school of thought He even described himself as part of the Paris School that included Samuel Beckett and Jean Genet However Ionesco's plays tended to be funnier and more viable than Beckett's He also used ritual and repetition for joking rather than the psychological revelations sought by Genet Theatre of the Absurd however deviates from conventional theatre because it uses different methods Its standards can only be judged by the standards of the Theatre of the Absurd It is however necessary to note that each writer of the absurd has his own personal approach to both the subject matter and form his own routes sources and background For Eugene Ionesco whose family was shuttled between his mother's France and his father's Rumania his drama is informed by this situation While a college student the young Ionesco broke with his father who was successively a Fascist and a Stalinist on political grounds Long afterwards he wondered whether he had been harsh to his father The adult Ionesco often described himself as an anarchist and objected to dissenters as much as those in power terming the opposition merely a state in the making Among the ironies in his career was that Americans who gave his play entitled Rhinoceros its warmest reception misunderstood it as a light comedy To Ionesco a city where everyone but the hero turns into a rhinoceros was a brutal metaphor In a journal note dated around nineteen-forty two decades before the play he wrote and we quote <quote_><quote/> End of quote While the above was purely Ionesco's view of the world in the absurd tradition the Theatre of the Absurd can be seen as the reflection of what seems to be a genuine representation of our time Other writers in the tradition like Albert Camus were basically concerned with the question why In his book entitled Myth of Sisyphus Camus tried to <?/>diagonalise the human situation in a world of shattered beliefs Camus wrote and we quote <quote_><quote/> End of quote But for Eugene Ionesco absurd is that which is devoid of pathos He observed and we quote <quote_><quote/> end of quote Definitely the passing away of Eugene Ionesco is a loss for those in the literary profession and especially for the lovers of absurd dramaAnd on that note listener we come to the end of this week's edition of the programme Books and Bookmen in which we focused on the works and life of the late Eugene Ionesco of the Theatre of the Absurd who died early this year in April And on behalf of the programme producer George Okore this is your presenter as usual <name/> saying good bye

<$A> however the cases and complications do occur which make the birth process risky and unsafe for both mother and child Every day more than one thousand women die from problems related to childbearing A Healthy Nation this week looks at various methods of reducing this death and prevent related illnesses Welcome
<$B> The birth of a new child to a family brings untold joy which often calls for celebration For many couples a child cements an otherwise complex relationship In the child is seen the chance to gain immortality to be remembered long after one has died To prepare for a safe delivery an expectant mother should make regular visits to maternal health clinic The first visit should be made immediately he realises she is pregnant She should also go for medical check-up if she finds she is bleeding gets premature labour or urinary infection A Healthy Nation visited some hospitals and health centres in South Nyanza and recorded activities at maternal clinics Health workers in MCH clinics are trained to carry out their commissions and give appropriate counsel to mothers Here a community nurse trainer takes the mother's blood pressure High blood pressure would be a danger to both mother and child Next to be taken is her haemoglobin level One of the most common problems during pregnancy is anaemia which can be corrected easily if detected early enough An expectant mother should also be tested for sugar and protein levels in her blood Health Workers will then establish if she has a history of diabetes The weight and height of the mother are also recorded This service is provided free in maternal and child health clinics all over the country A physical examination is carried out to establish her ability to carry the pregnancy to full term and manage a safe delivery For this to be done she has to lie on the examination couch where palpitation of the abdomen is conducted This helps establish if the foetus is lying in a safe and normal position A pregnant mother undergoes changes which make it crucial for her to have regular check-ups Doctor <name/> in <name/> hospital outlined some of the changes
<$C> First before she becomes pregnant the body has to be prepared for that uh pregnancy The uterus the inlines inside lining of the uterus thickens and evokes more glands more blood vessels more lymphatics These will be ready to receive the fertilised ovum and nourish it for the nine month that it will take <./>in inside the uterus During this time the blood circulation in the lady has to increase The heart has to increase its work The food that is eaten has to be for the two That's the mother as well as the uh expected baby For this reason we have to be very careful what we food we eat uh and how we treat this pregnant mother The body has also to be prepared to carry this pregnancy through the nine months For this reason you find that in some cases if there are some diseases which are hidden they tend to come out because that is stress to the body and uh for this reason we have to take care and be sure that should there be any of these diseases we should take care of them and control them as the mother goes through pregnancy Uh psychologically the mother will also be affected because she is expecting the baby perhaps the first baby She has never gone through all the stages particularly the stage of bearing the baby that labour pains So these changes have to be prepared for
<$B> Before leaving the clinic the mother is advised on what to do to be ready for the delivery She should rest enough beside getting enough sleep Strenuous work should be avoided especially over the last three months She should eat a balanced diet She should also avoid smoking Drug should only be taken with a doctor's prescription Alcohol would be detrimental to the foetus' growth and is often the cause of low birth-weight Mothers with a history of difficult deliveries need special care So do mothers with <name/> disease or heart conditions A look at a typical delivery room shows some of the facilities that would be used for such mothers especially in case of complication
<$D> This one we use for listening to the foetal hearts before the mothers delivers A mother might deliver a baby which has what we call foetal distress and unable to breathe soon after birth so that <O/> is allowed to assist him or her so that it breathes as fast as possible by what we call mouth-to-mouth breathing We suck we use this one for we put one inside the mouth the nose there and the other one we put into our mouth using <O/> then you suck the mucus which might hinder the baby's breathing Here as well we also have our scissors for cutting the cord of the baby after birth Here again where we have sucker also for sucking the nose of the baby As soon as the baby has come we try as much help we can You squeeze it before you put it on the baby's nose Then you let it expand like that to suck the mucus which are in the baby's nose or throat Then the baby becomes able to breathe This one is also a container for our transport <O/> When you want to take something in a sterile region you come and take one take it like this then go with it and take what you need to <?/>strengthen a solution where also people free from infection <$E> Comments on the impact of traditional birth attendance
<$F> TBAs are also very useful because they motivate mothers to bring their children to the to the clinic for immunisation They live within the community and they know the community very well They know in such and such a home there is a child who is under five who should be brought to the clinic We also use them to motivate the community on family planning They know that the <-/>the families within their areas very well They know some of their taboos and beliefs So we find them very useful to motivate the community on family planning They are also useful because now they know the cases to refer to the hospital the ones they should deal with and in case there is a deformed baby they know what to do They will always refer them to the hospital where the deformity can be corrected or parents can be advised on how to use on how to take care of these children 
<$A> Giving birth is a natural process Ninety per cent of all births are normal and end up without complication However the risks that affect the remaining ten per cent can be drastically reduced by attending regular check-ups during pregnancy It is recommended that expectant mothers with previous difficulties those under eighteen and those above thirty-five years should deliver in hospitals under the assistance of qualified health workers This should go a long way towards saving the lives of both mother and child Have a healthy week

<$A> A programme that focuses on modern trends in our cultural and ethical development
In this week's edition of the programme we focus on the <-/indiscipline> of <ea/>matatu drivers and totes Chinua Achebe in his book entitled Troubled Nigeria defines <-/indiscipline> as the failure or refusal to submit one's desires and actions to the restraints of orderly social contact in recognition of the rights and desires of others He asserts then the goal of <-/indiscipline> is self-interest Its action the abandonment of self-restraint in pursuit of the goal but the action may sometimes defeat the goal Sometimes when one reflects seriously about the problems of this nation the temptation to agree with Achebe on this matter is great Indeed <-/indiscipline> is by definition distinct from lawlessness The line between the two is often tenuous indeed But the problem we have in our society is that <-/indiscipline> in some sector has escalated into lawlessness What we have is therefore mass <-/indiscipline> This is not an exaggeration Any rational Kenyan knows that we have a serious problem in the transport sector There is indeed no better place to observe <-/indiscipline> at its best in Kenya than on the roads The <ea/>matatu drivers and totes have actually become a nuisance They seem not to have any sense of order and fair play Rarely do they apply themselves intelligently to things that call for this It appears that the <ea/>matatu drivers have decided the traffic rules do not apply to them They break traffic regulations by causing unnecessary traffic jams in the city Sometimes they overtake on the sidewalk recklessly endangering the lives of innocent pedestrians It is this lack of common sense that makes some Kenyans to wonder why mature adults should be proud of breaking rules that govern social order Sometimes it beats all logic It makes some of us wonder whether we are sinking into savagery or we are building a civilised society The irony is that some of these people who have no sense of order they have criticised others especially in the political sphere for mistakes they themselves are masters of Let us face it if the <ea/>matatu and bus drivers cannot respect traffic rules and if they cannot be made to then we shall continue to lose a large number of able-bodied Kenyans through accidents The senseless murder of fellow Kenyans through what is referred to as accidents is the most revolting thing of this decade For sure speed limit does not exist to this driver The needless horror and death intelligent people bring to others is quite shameful When will our people learn to do things without being supervised Why should policemen be dotted all over to remind the drivers that they need to obey traffic rules If one is disciplined he or she does not invite supervision by an external force Discipline is imposed by the individual from within Indeed discipline is either self-discipline or it is nothing at all If one has received adequate social education then he or she should know that it is in his or her interest to follow rules but the <ea/>matatu drivers are not alone in this mad chase for money They are assisted heavily by their <O/> men Otherwise referred to as totes or in street language <ea/>manamba The <ea/>manamba are perhaps the most <-/indisciplined> lot in the country They first and foremost specialised in making noise Approach any bus stop and you will hear them howling like wild animals The reason why they howl is really not clear because every Kenyan who has been say to Nairobi knows the number of the bus or <ea/>matatu that goes to his or her destination Why should these people howl and force you into a <ea/>matatu even before you make up your mind to enter the <ea/>matatu Intelligent people need silence to think about what is expected of them The kind of noise we encounter in some places in our towns really inconveniences many people The <-/indiscipline> of the <ea/>manamba manifests itself just when you approach the door of the <ea/>matatu If you are a woman then your tribulations will be more One for instance will run and hold your waist as if you are a lover If you get offended and complain what follows sometimes are abuses But if you are patient enough and enter the <ea/>matatu then another nightmare begins You are pushed and packed as if you are a sacks of <O/> If you resist abuses follow Some passengers interviewed confessed that they have been at times threatened by <ea/><?/>rungos Then the music is played at full volume Why these totes and drivers imagine that music played at full volume makes sense defeats reason In fact what people listen to is not music but noise Some time back playing of loud music was prohibited but again <ea/>matatu drivers and totes do not respect rules Of course passengers feel bad but Kenyans being what they are peace-loving people they do not complain aloud but for sure they hate this madness Let us however remember that as <ea/>matatu drivers and totes flout traffic rules there are many Kenyans especially those who drive who are quite organised They follow traffic rules and just wonder why their fellow Kenyans fail to employ their common sense But the fear is soon or later they might be infected by this madness which appears contagious The big question however is why this <-/indiscipline> What went wrong Of course the answer is simple Greed for money has simply turned our brothers into monsters Sometimes they can charge any amount of money they want to They do not even respect the old people This is something that really worries rational people We know that in our culture there is insistence on respect for elders There are several reasons First in the traditional system of education the elders taught younger ones all there was to be learnt Now in every teacher student relationship the student has to respect the teacher That respect generates the humility that is needed if we have to continue learning Young people therefore have to respect elders In <ea/>matatus you will hear them shouting at elders as if they are age-mates Sometimes when some of us think about the future we wonder how the country shall be like when these confused people will be elder If these people continue to nurture this rampaging selfishness will they have time to build a disciplined society The truth of the matter is that we must recognise the emergence status of this situation and treat it accordingly This nation can do better only if we eradicate <-/indiscipline> over few people before it spreads 
And on that note listener we come to the end of this week's edition of the programme Culture Talk This programme was produced by George Okode and I am Igara Kabaji saying goodbye

<$A> The philosophy behind the whole exercise was that traditional oral literature is replete with sex type trawls that are redundant The narratives for example perpetrate certain stereotypes of men and women where such characteristics may no longer be valid due to the social economic and political changes taking place the world over
from different people <name/> convened a seminar where the entries were read evaluated and recommended or not recommended for publication The seminar was held at the <?/>Salvud Hotel <?/>Milimani from August twentieth to twenty-second and was opened by the director of African Women's Communication Network FEMNET Dr Edda <?/>Chachukia In her keynote address Dr <?/>Chachukia gave a very precise background to the whole question of gender naturally leading to the point of how <O/> and oral literature come into the whole spectrum The whole question of gender gained momentum when the United Nations declared the decade from nineteen seventy-six to nineteen eighty-six the UN Decade for Women It had been realised that women who constitute half the world's population remained marginalized and unaccounted for in development terms This marginalization resulted largely from the ignorance of development planners in the nineteen fifties and nineteen sixties The crucial role of women as producers was ignored and a picture of man as the family bread winner was and still is being perpetrated <name/> observed that technology has not necessarily improved the lot of women In fact it has added to their load of work For example the introduction of the ox plough meant that more land came under cultivation This essentially increased the amount of weeding and planting to be done mainly by women The increased enrolment of children in schools in itself has deprived women of domestic helpers hence increasing their work-load and creating a lot of strain on their time resources Because of the differentiated roles women continue to play in society there was need to examine their participation in this context This necessitated a shift from the women in development strategy to the gender and development approach which concerns itself with the gender roles and relationships and tries to influence them for the greatest benefits to individual communities and society as a whole In other words the gender and development strategy takes stock of the status quo the factors that have determined that status quo and how they can be changed for the better This obviously cannot be done without creating a new cultural ethic and one tool creating this ethic is literature whether oral or written Oral literature as we know it plays a very important role in socialising the child into the beliefs attitudes traditions and history of his or her society The gender images the child receives persist in the mind and are near impossible to change in later life If the society's oral literature or all other art is influenced to depict both men and women in desirable light then this is what the child carries into adulthood It may be felt among conservatives that going to the extent of deliberately creating stories with a particular ideology in mind is prostituting literature But one must also realise that oral literature is not static In fact there are already so many narratives and songs that have been recreated by artists to suit different ideological purposes The process might be said to have been slow with regard to gender But that only makes it more urgent to go out of the way and infuse gender into the material that we have The conservatives will argue that creativity is inspired and that the artist should not be given a blueprint not to deviate from in his or her creation But the fact also is that artists do not get inspired in a vacuum They basically have the society's experiences to talk about in the society's language They're therefore subject to the dictations of these factors even before they start creating in which case it may not be valid to regard the <O/> exercise as propaganda Indeed this reminds us of the old debate about what is good literature and what is not On one side there are those who have always viewed literature as an instrument of social action They contend that literature cannot be divorced from the social concerns of the society and that it must articulate the needs of the majority of that society When it does not do this then it is regarded as escapist literature On the other hand there are those who contend that literature is a purely creative venture which may or may not be dictated by social issues To them what literature must achieve is a beauty of form Critics of this approach will point out that our society cannot afford such literature that is only aesthetic when all around us there is turmoil poverty and inequality The <O/> emphasis therefore falls under the socially committed approach to literature that which realises that there are gross balances in the society and go out of the way to correct them As it were we cannot at this moment in history have writers for the sake of writing not as far as the gender question is concerned Dr <?/>Chachukia summarised it effectively when she said that Kenya needs writers who are knowledgeable about who we are where we have come from and where we're headed to She said such writers will be able to create literature that recognises changes in the society and works towards liberation from negative conservatism If we can start with oral literature why not

<$A> You are listening to KBC Nairobi The time is now a quarter to eight 
<$B><Coming up we're playing Ties that Bind Meet experts <?/>overall for practical tools some understanding where love and tenderness can be nurtured back to <?/>both So let us hold our eyes and say amen 
<$C> After listening to your programme I felt that I've <AmE/>gotten the answer to my long-time problems which started back in nineten eighty-six I'm thirty-three years of age and a mother of three aged between thirteen and nine years legally married for thirteen years My problem started after my father-in-law's death At least he was able to control his son when I went to him with various complaints Since his death I have never known what peace is And this has made me hate my husband My ignorance initially made me live with him without noticing his immoral immorality But after he turned violent I started seeing through him I was an innocent girl when he married me Nowadays I wonder if I ever loved him though Well may be it was but the character changed me into a totally different woman I've tried to bear with him but I'm seeing disaster in the near future if something is not done What do I do Please help me He has subjected me to a lot of humiliations and brain torture that I feel I am worth nothing though he claims to love me I don't love him anymore I moved to stay up-country to see if I could work but all in vain When he comes my God his breath alone makes me want to throw up when he wants to kiss me 
<$C> Thank you very much Elisabeth for this emotional letter and thank you <name/> for reading it out for us With us in the studio once again is our expert in counselling Joan <?/>Kohenange And she is going to highlight us on this problem
<$D> Thank you Tabita I thank you very much Elisabeth It takes courage and strength of character to be able to write about problems you've experienced in thirteen years of your marital life married life You mentioned in your letter that your father-in-law was able to control your husband and since his death you feel helpless and unable to continue living with him It seems as if you are trying to avoid a confrontation with your husband by moving up-country However you mentioned that when he visits you expect to act like his wife If you suspected he is immoral that he is engaging in sexual intercourse with other women it is important that you consider ways in which you can protect yourself from sexually transmitted and fatal infections such as HIV or AIDS You have also written that your husband is a violent man Maybe before I talk about the violence I just want to emphasise on these uh sexually transmitted diseases a little HIV or AIDS is very real In our counselling offices we are getting many many people coming in people who are already infected with the virus and people who are hurting because their relatives are infected with the virus So we are getting in our centres the infected and the affected people and it is a serious situation The disease is not sparing anyone from the executives incorporations corporate circles in hotel industries two messengers and cleaners in government offices AIDS is not sparing anyone Homes are in a <O/> For you all dear listeners and also for you Elisabeth I just want to let people know that this is a serious disease and people should take precaution because many people are already infected and many people are already dying Now to get back to Elisabeth and the area of <./>vio <-/>of <-/>of violence You spoke about your husband being a violent man who has subjected you to physical and emotional abuse It means in one way or the other Elisabeth that your husband has lost respect for you Violence is not good And I want to add here that violence is a learned behaviour Your husband chooses He has a choice He chooses to subject you to that humiliation No way Elisabeth but no way can you cause your husband to beat you senseless like a little child You are not a child and neither is he He has chosen to use force on you Therefore he is solely responsible for the behaviour Even if he has decided to how come Elisabeth that he doesn't go and beat his boss You see he's specifically used to beat He could just as well have chosen to go and beat his mother or even his brothers and sisters or even his children but he doesn't He is very selective about his beating habits and he has chosen you as the person who is going to meet out his vengeance on So really it is a learned behaviour He has chosen to beat you He can just as well un-choose to beat you He can unlearn the behaviour and it is wrong for society to continue to ignore these insults on women No man has a right to beat his wife Women are not property They are just like men human beings We know men <-/>men of character don't beat their wives It is when men are threatened and they are feeling insecure that they have to lush out at something weaker than themselves And I just want to repeat this violence physical violence especially or any other form of abuse of a women is learned behaviour and it can be unlearned just uh just the same way as it was learned and it's no excuse and it's not right for man to say oh my wife made me do it How does she make him do it She didn't hold your hand to her face to her eye for you to beat her
<$D> They say they are provoked
<$E> How come women are not provoked to beat him their husbands It's unfair for someone who is stronger to go and mete out such vengeance on a weaker person Listeners there are alternative ways of trying to communicate on a basis to your spouse It doesn't have to be by beating One can communicate by talking by arranging a <O/> a little <O/> personal home <O/> or something like that There are other alternatives Beating is not the answer That is physical abuse of women Elisabeth you need to make the decision as to whether you wish to remain in such a traumatising and <./>dista dissatisfying marriage It becomes very confusing when a man makes you feel worthless and unhappy But he claims that he loves you on one hand bashes you around and really kills you On the other he says with his you know with his mouth he speaks and says he loves you Somehow they don't the two don't seem chained together When in doubt always look to the behaviour not to the words that are coming up from the mouth When you consider the options available Elisabeth you may decide that to be best to continue the marriage may be so as not to hurt the children or you may decide that may be living alone may be better in order to try and make the situation better for yourself However if your husband no longer respects you and uses every opportunity to humiliate you maybe he's putting forth a message He wants you to leave and as such then you are better off gone Your husband is not likely to change his attitude towards you no matter what you do right now whether it <-/>it involves moving away or trying to do things to please him or agreeing to find arrangements that may result in peace to you or your children in the future But on the other hand Elisabeth I don't want you to totally give up on him I would suggest that you pray for him that perhaps God may touch him In other results total conversion may take place a total roundabout change It takes God to make a marriage successful not luck or chance
<$D> Joan at times you advise uh a couple to separate 
<$E> Yes There are times I would suggest okay the choice is always left to the spouse that has come in with a problem but there are times I would suggest that may be wise at a point in time for the couple to separate 
<$D> Why
<$E> and with this young man who was so used to beating up his wife physically abusing her hitting her with anything crockery anything just anything in the household he gets hold of he just throws it and when he gets off her he doesn't care where he gets hold of her whether it's her hair her arm whatever he would just grab her round and really give her a thorough bashing and then it went on and it continued from bad to worse One point he would chase her with rocks in his hands He'd go out and get the biggest stone come round and throw the stone on her sometimes the stones <?/>connect sometimes they didn't The last time was when he chased her around with a axe I mean he was ready to hack her <-_>hack her<-/> to death and he was that angry and burst with such violence So at that point uh uh we <-/>we <-/>we decided it's better to separate than one spouse kill the other one and then after that we start talking And sure enough they separated but uh it was the case was able to <-_>able to<-/> resolve the issues uh and we got support from the family and uh we walked through it
<$D> Thank you very much listener We continue from there

<$A> The current affairs programme
<$A> In the programme tonight former US President Jimmy Carter arrives in Nairobi The <O/> alliance in the Balkans between Croats and Muslims And call for Egypt's fuel industry My name is Ann <?/>McKer
Former United States' President Jimmy Carter arrived in Kenya today on a four nation tour of Africa Edward <?/>Mushey has more
<$B> A report from the US embassy in Nairobi said Carter and his wife Rosalyn are scheduled to leave for Ethiopia tomorrow where they are expected to meet with Prime Minister <name/> Well on Thursday they travel to Uganda where they'll meet President Museveni While in Kenya Rosalyn Carter is scheduled to speak before a group of Sudanese women attending a conference in Nairobi organised by the UN development fund for women Carter has made two previous trips to Africa this year to prepare the unveiling of Global two thousand and health programme developed by the Carter Centre of Atlanta Georgia Global two thousand aims to eradicate two diseases plaguing Africa One involves the guinea-worm a parasite that lives under human and animal skin and the other disease is river blindness
<$A> Ministers from Zaire and Rwanda met today with UN refugee agency officials to discuss how to speed up the repatriation of more than a million Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire The delegations came together for the day long talks on the repatriation issue of mostly Hutu refugees who fled to Zaire during last years civil war in Rwanda Zaire wants all the refugees repatriated by the end of this year under the current UN high commissioner for refugees' programme It has also threatened to resume force because patience in the repatriation process doesn't <?/>need the year end deadline Zaire had started forcibly repatriating refugees last month but stopped under international pressure The three delegations to the talks are being lead by Zairian Deputy PrimeMminister Gerard Comanda Rwandan Rehabilitation Minister Patrick Massim Haka and UN High Commissioner for Refugees Sakado Ogata
Two United States envoys arrived in Sarajevo today to try and persuade the Bosnian government to abandon its boycott of key Bosnian peace talks scheduled to take place in New York this week Edward <?/>Mushey
<$B> Christopher Hayle and Robert Owen arrived in the Bosnian capitol even as Sarajevo repeated its demands that it wanted guarantees that any possible peace settlement for the former Yugoslavian Republic would not involve its partition The United States diplomats were sent to Sarajevo yesterday following Sarajevo's announcement that it will not take part in tomorrow's talks with the Croatian and <O/> Yugoslav foreign ministers to discuss a peace plan for Bosnia-Herzegovina The Bosnian information ministry has said that Hayle a specialist in central European territory claims and Owen a lawyer will start talks at the Bosnian presidency at ten thirty a m The talks between the United States envoys and Bosnian government officials today are expected to open up Bosnian idea of a draft peace plan which Sarajevo fears sanctions the fact of partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina Bosnian misgivings prompted President Alija Izetbegovic to announce yesterday night that Sarajevo would boycott the New York talks which were scheduled to bring Bosnian Foreign Minister Mohammed <name/> together with his counterparts from Croatia and <?/>rest Yugoslavia
<$A> <O/> talks between the major players by the American States Department envoy Richard Holbrooke the Foreign Ministers of Bosnia Croatia and Serbia agreed to sit down together in Geneva Switzerland for preliminary peace talks Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim led government made clear what they want out of any peace settlements The Serbs want to remain in control of as much of the territory they have seized on the battle field as possible The government is still intending rebuilding a unitary state What about the Croatian government Zagreb has encouraged Bosnian Croats to build their own de facto state and they have shown novel misgivings although there has been no fighting between Croats and Muslims for some time As Richard <?/>Korathes reports from Croatian capitol Zagreb the goals cannot meet the hidden ambitions 
<$C> In March nineteen ninety-four more than a year of vicious fighting between Croats and Muslims in Bosnia ended when they agreed with some American arm twisting to form a federation President Clinton watched over the signing of the accord in Washington while Croatian president Franjo Tudjman heralded it as a new era in relations between his state and neighbouring Bosnia 
<$D> The historic step which has been taken today will be of immense mutual benefit for Croats and Bosnian Muslims laying a strong foundation for lasting peace and the stable future in this region and assuring for both peoples full national sovereignty and full parity in state affairs 
<$C> When the war broke out in Bosnia-Herzegovina in nineteen ninety-two the Croats and Muslims were initially allied against the Serbs who quickly seized two thirds of the country Tension built up between Croats and Muslims as refugees flooded what was left of government held territory Extreme nationalist Croats seized south western Herzegovina and brutally expelled Muslims as they carved out a break away republic they called Herzeg Bosnia Commentator from broadcast from the Balkans Nana <?/>Cebec argues that it was inevitable relations between the two communities would break down 
<$E> It was never an alliance it was only a marriage of convenience The heartland of Croatian nationalism lies not in Croatia proper but lies in western Herzegovina the south uh western corner of Bosnia-Herzegovina That is where you will find the most fierce Croat nationalists and they are the ones who started the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina against uh Bosnian Muslims It was a very vicious war That fighting was stopped under heavy pressure by Washington and we had early in nineteen ninety-four the shot gun wedding between Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims
<$C> A year and a half later an uneasy alliance between the Croats and Muslims is still holding The Washington agreement not only created a federation between the Muslims and Croats in Bosnia but also a confederation between Bosnia and neighbouring Croatia That allowed the Muslims to have access to the sea via Croatia's coastline while Bosnian Croats were given some political links with Croatia proper in the hope they would abandon attempts to unify with the motherland But has the deal eased suspicions between Muslims and Croats led to no co-operation on the ground Nana <?/>Cebec again
<$E> None whatsoever apart from some tactical uh fighting against the Serbs In Mostar uh where I been just a month ago which is uh supposed to be a unified city once again not a single step has been made towards a proper alliance between Croats and Muslims On the contrary what I have seen on the ground is just as much hatred uh and the desire to live separately as one saw may be a year and a half ago when the fighting was at its fiercest
