<$A> You find that uh we have got this uh scramble Yes
<$B> Scramble means fighting for something
<$A> Scramble means fighting for something Yes Any idea different from that Anyone with a different idea or do you want to add something from that
<$B> Scramble is competition against somebody
<$A> Yes, you are some of you not far from the really <O/> At least there are ideas in there that is Maybe to put it clear Scramble is <O/> or a competition or a struggle for something Now when you come to the term scramble for East Africa This means the struggle for acquisition of territories in East Africa by the European powers And what about 
<$A> Come in And what about partition Yes
<$B> Partition means dividing the <O/> parts
<$A> Partition means dividing the 
<$B> <O/> parts
<$A> <O/> <O/> Okay by definition or partition it's also clear that to <?/>straight Do you have any idea
<$B> <O/> division
<$A> Okay
<$B> Partition is a process of dividing an area according to the given or <O/>
<$A> Okay you have advanced more than the previous one Okay maybe to put it clearly It's more or less the aim that is partition is the division when we refer to East Africa partition is the division of territories by the said given powers Now the partition I mean the scramble and partition of East Africa took place as I told you before that it took place different from that of Africa So it took place for only about sixteen years It took place from eighteen eighty-four to ninteen hundred This is eighteen Now let us <-_>let us<-/> now see the causes or the major reasons for the scramble and partition Because we have seen that scramble and partition The European powers they are just scrambling for something for acquisition of something Now what we have to mention is the reason for this scramble and partition We can have some of your views before I add mine
<$B> They <-_was><+_were> finding area for for investment and raw material
<$A> Yes
<$B> for their industry 
<$A> okay Yes What do you say <name/>
<$B> They were struggling for markets
<$A> For markets My colleague here has said areas for investment and raw materials Come in Another reason Yes
<$B> Cheap labour
<$A> Cheap labour Can you find the other one Yes
<$B> Markets for manufactured goods
<$A> Markets <-/>Markets for their manufactured goods Now you have mentioned these reasons They are obvious but they all fall under the major reason which is titled the industrial revolution Now these are the demands which are created by the industrial revolution That means as you read from the previous topic that there was the rise of the industrial revolution and this industrial revolution in Europe created a lot of demands and these are some of the demands which they wanted That is the European countries wanted to acquire these demands in Africa and in East Africa So this is one of the <-_reason><+_reasons> as to why the European countries came to East Africa to acquire colonies or territories Another reason is the rise of monopolies That means the European countries wanted very much as The European countries wanted to acquire colonies in Africa and other parts of the world due to their ambition By then there was an ambition of European countries Most European countries <./>want wanted to acquire colonies It was just as as we can say a prestige <O/> If some a certain country will be having a colony then it will be called a big nation So this can we we can put <-_>we can put<-/> it here that the rise of monopolies as one of the major reasons <-_German><+_Germany> Britain I mean Italy by then and other European countries were struggling very much to acquire colonies together with Portugal as you read from the previous topic about the agents which were sent to Africa and the other parts of East Africa the explorers All these were agents They went there to see the potentiality or the potential of the land which will be explored in Africa As we have can we have another reason so far If at all you can see or you can think about it Yes
<$B> The increase in population in their countries
<$A> The increase in population Somebody said that but to defend it needs a lot of explanation I may explain it just to put it clear That is by eighteen eighty-four or by the century seventeen the seventeenth century it was there was a rise of population in Europe And the <-/>the population was much to the extent that these areas for investment let's say to establish plantations was very difficult <-_>was very difficult<-/> because the areas were all populated So the rise of population in Europe caused <-/>caused the European countries to send some of the <-/>the <-/>the population to come to Africa and other parts of East Africa so that they can reduce but this reason is always taken as a minor not major essential But it is one of the reasons due to the fact that once people were running bankrupt that means they didn't have money and they decided to <-/>to <-/>to come to East Africa so that they can be employed You know if a country is having a lot of population then definitely there will be no employment But the employment by then were only available in East Africa to run the administration administration activities and other uh employment or occupation So this population can be one but mind you if you put it as one of your reasons you must defend it thoroughly It needs a lot of explanation Even now by the moment I have explained it in a short way But I think these are some of the reasons for the scramble for and the partition East Africa The other reason which I may put it is that Britain by <./>eigh <-/>by eighteen eighty-four was already having the territories of Egypt and the Suez Canal So as you know Egypt is using a lot of Let's say the population of Egypt is only centred along the river Nile So definitely the river Nile is essential to the lives of the population of Egypt Since then Egypt was using efficiently that river Nile and you know definitely that the river the source of the river Nile is East Africa and some parts in Somalia around Ethopia but a lot of water comes from East Africa When Egypt I mean Britain controlled was running or <O/> Egypt then Britain is so essential or was responsible Actually it was just pretending as if that She was just <-_>she was just<-/> pretending as if that since we have taken Egypt we must also take parts of East Africa which the source of the river Nile comes from So we can put it that Britain wanted monopoly in East Africa since it had already occupied Egypt Britain wanted monopoly in East Africa because she has already occupied Egypt which use the source of the <-/>the river Nile which of which the source of the river Nile is where In East Africa So that is these are among the reasons which you find but these are the major ones These are some books which are trying to explain some other reasons but they tend to <-/>to mix up For instance the industrial revolution has got these reasons as independent but we can put them together as or we can arrange them adjacent Now we have seen the reasons for the scramble for and the partition <O/> I want to go to the partition process As I told you that the partition process in Africa was somehow different from the partition of Africa Now the partition of East Africa went through the mainly we can say two processes through the agreements of three countries namely Britain Germany and the Sultan of Zanzibar But for the agreements which we can consider now is We can consider two agreements that made for the partition of East Africa The first one is <./>Anglo Anglo-Germany Agreement of eighteen eighty-six and the second one is Anglo-German Agreement of nineteen hundred Now let me show you how the partition was by using a map which I drew The reasons for their agreement was of course that to settle their problems so that they cannot they can no longer go on scrambling or struggling for acquisitionof <-_colony><+_colonies> or territories They decided now the following British <-/>British took the Kenya mainland except some parts that are indicated on the map This is Kenya but Uganda by then was not colonised or taken by any country It was free You remember the kingdoms were still dominating there For instance Presidents <name/> <name/> I mean <name/> etcera And <name/> together with <name/> was taken by Germany This is what they agreed The coastal strip this is ten-mile coastal strip together with Zanzibar and in the following towns <nmae/> <name/> Mogadischu and <name/> <-_was><+_were> taken by the Sultan of Zanzibar This is what they agreed for the first Anglo-German Agreement of eighteen eighty-six For the first for the second Anglo-German agreement of eighteen I mean of nineteen hundred they agreed the following This is the map which was obtained by eighteen I mean nineteen It is by eighteen nineteen nineteen <./>hund nineteen ninety-four I'm sorry <O/> This is nineteen hundred by nineteen I mean nineteen nought four So they agreed the following but for this agreement the second agreement the Sultan of Zanzibar was no longer considered That means Britain took the whole part of Kenya Uganda together with the previous part which was obtained by the Sultan of Zanzibar That is Zanzibar Zanzibar was now always given a certain part as is shown it is shown on the map here but this part was also under control under the control of though the capital of Zanzibar was given this part it was also under control of the Sultan I mean the <-/>the British <-_German><+_Germany> was now given the whole mainland of Tanzania today So I say <-_German><+_Germany> was given Tanzania How do you take this all this I'm now waiting for your questions about the logic as a whole but I have a few comments on the <O/> agreement which was <-/>was <?/>settled I was discussing with the previous uh class when they introduced another topic I mean another point they showed Helgoland This you may have read this Helgoland or you have you may have read this Helgoland Treaty This Helgoland is just an island in the North Sea Do you know the North Sea where it is Where is it Anyway the North Sea is just near the Greenland in <-/>in near It's near Greenland So it just an island in the North Sea Helgoland was by then not taken by either Italy or other parts I mean other countries except it was being scrambled by British by the British and the <-_German><+_Germans> So during the Anglo-German Agreement of nineteen hundred they decided that this part of I mean this island should be taken by the <-_German><+_Germans> That's why in other literature or in other books you find the Anglo-German Agreement of nineteen hundred is known as Helgoland Treaty or Helgoland Agreement Now I allow you to ask questions
<$B> So you have said the second agreement the Sultan he was she was not <-_>she was not<-/> involved 
<$A> Yes
<$B> Why with the first agreement he was very involved 
<$A> Yes
<$B> while the first agreement he involved Sultan I don't know why
<$A> I have said that for the first time he was very much involved just because when <-_German><+_Germans> came as I showed you on the map here he was <?/>apported a big actually a vast land So when the British and the <-_German><+_Germans> came they were supposed to consider also the area to be taken by the Sultan of Zanzibar Remember the Sultan of Zanzibar Said Said shifted the capital from Mecca or Muscat 
<$B> Yes
<$A> Muscat
<$B> Yes
<$A> Okay Muscat to Zanzibar in the eighteen forties So it was this was very somehow very very very near or it shows when this scramble for and partition by of East Africa by eighteen eighty-four by the European <./>count by the European powers then it shows this is far away from eighteen forties when the Said Said shifted his capital
S1B002T
<$B> I don't think my colleague has told something about the factors of the collapse
<$A> He didn't tell about the factors which led factors which led to the collapse of feudal mode of production <-/>mhm Yes 
<$B> I think they haven't <./>talk talked about the characteristics of feudal mode of production
<$A> They didn't tell anything about the characteristics of feudal mode of production Completely that the group hasn't telled anything completely <-/>mhm 
<$?> No
<$A> Yes I heard something
<$B> Yes
<$A> <-/>mhm
<$B> <Name/> feudalism consists of two classes landlords and the serfs The serfs were not slaves because they had land to build their homes Also they owned their instruments of labour Exploitation of serfs rested on the <./>land landlords controlling the major means of production So this paragraph shows how the characteristics of what feudalism was
<$A> Characteristics
<$B> Yes
<$?> Yes sir
<$B> in this book they have written one in this <O/>
<$A> which book
<$B> I think it is written by <name/>
<$A> <name/>
<$B> Yes
<$A> Which one There are many books written by <name/>
<$B>
<$A> No centralised state in feudal mode of production How do you perceive it Our friend is saying that he referred to a certain book written by <name/>and he got the point that in feudal mode of production no exploitation of serfs
<$B>could you please explain us more widely or openly so that we can <-_>we can<-/> know what <-/>what is it what is he talking about when he said centralised state 
<$A> Who can help you Who can answer <name/>
<$B> I didn't understand the question Who has asked the question Maybe you can tell us
<$A> Yes
<$B> What
<$B> <O_><O/> I mean there is no situation of power
<$B> What
<$B> There is no situation of power
<$B> How
<$B> How I think because when you have a feudal mode of production one of the men should be the one who has got the power so the kings has no power
<$B> The kings were having power because
<$B> No you serfs you were <-_>you were<-/> supposed to pay something in return of the use of what of land 
<$B> land Yes 
<$B> Why can you say there was no power 
<$A> Just don't quarrel We are not quarrelling
<$B> Yes
<$B> So I think there was <O/> model there was a <O/> power For the feudal lord it meant that they put power upon the serfs So the serfs were responsible to do <-_>to do<-/> what to do work for the lords so it means that all the powers were upon the lords <-/>mhm 
<$A> <-/>mhm
<$B> Yes sir 
<$B> Yes <O_><O/> because you have a good point Another feature of feudalism mode of production is that there is no strong centralised power political power industrialised or <./>centralis centralising such that the King is just one among the lords The feudal lords had their own private funds and the tenants
<$A> <-/>mhm Okay the way you said they had no centralised power and in the reference you'll find it in your book you are saying that there was no strong centralised power power
<$B> Yes
<$A> Therefore there was weak centralised power isn't it 
<$B> Yes
<$A> Okay what I will tell you is that Anyway do you have examples of feudal modes of production in some parts of Africa
<$B> Yes
<$A> Like where
<$B> Nigeria
<$A> Where
<$B> Nigeria
<$A> Nigeria 
<$B> <-/>mhm in East Africa
<$A> Nigeria At what time <-/>mhm
<$B> Imperial time
<$B> Nineteenth century
<$A> In the nineteenth
<$B> Nineteenth century
<$A> Eighteenth
<$B> Century 
<$A> Good
<$B> In the <O/> region specifically in <name/> isn't it 
<$?> Yes 
<$A> That is where you can trace the <O/>
<$A> So then we can also cite our example to Egypt 
<$B> during Pharaoh
<$A> Egypt during Pharaoh Egypt during Pharaoh there was a kind of feudalism there So in the in terms of the expressions of our friend that there was no strong centralised power Do you get the point that Ghana has a weak centralised power Can you take the point that <O/> kingdom was or was not a centralised kingdom <-/>mhm
<$B> Centralised kingdom
<$A> It was
<$?> A centralised kingdom 
<$A> What about Egypt during Pharaoh
<$B> A centralised
<$A> It was centralised
<$?> Yes 
<$A> So in the case of Africa one can take a point that these kingdoms which we can refer giving examples were highly centralised but even our friends in Europe the <-/>the mode of production didn't encourage the centralisation the strong centralisation of state Because if this was the land owned by one feudal lord This is the land You may take an example that this land is There are routes somewhere <-_towni><+_towns> and the other portion nearby this is taken by another feudal lord so those people were leaders of these particular places Okay 
<$?> Yes
<$A> And once you cross this particular place you will find that some rules guiding that particular place And once you go to the left you'll find another different kind of rules guiding that particular place If it is just paying tax or tributes you will pay tribute in this place or be <O/> a feudal lord or you'll also go on paying at <-/>at least in <./>ei <-/>in each <-_>in each<-/> feudal lord you give a tribute until you reach the place you'll stay So that's how our friend can substantiate his point that there was no strong centralised state There was no one who was at the <O/> Okay there was no one who was at the <O/> like the kings of <O/> So that's how we can deal with that one Anything which you may think that our friends' presentation is lacking or you make corrections Anything Okay another thing I think our friends did not discuss
<$A> Louder please
<$B> They defined the term feudalism but they haven't explained the cause of this feudalism
<$A> The cause of feudalism What our friend is trying to say is that that group which presented didn't show what was the mode of production just above or just before feudalism so those of you that presentation started without introducing us what was the former mode of production What was the former mode of production before feudalism 
<$?> slavery
<$A> So those guys didn't show us that feudalism took place after slavery Okay Starting from the beginning what do you think were the reasons for the salient reasons for the collapse of feudalism <-_>of feudalism<-/> the salient reasons leaving those minor reasons What were the salient reasons which led to the collapse of feudal mode of production <-/>mhm Who can try Yes
<$B> Increase of population and the growth of society
<$A> There was an increase of population <-/>mhm Yes Once you refer to Uganda you find that it was highly populated and there are some reasons why it was highly populated <-/>mhm Another reason That's one
<$B> Increase in size in wealth 
<$A> Accumulation of wealth That is another point that people started to accumulate wealth and to privatise some kind of property <-/>mhm Another reason Another thing you <-/>you may think was the major reason for the collapse 
<$B> There was no <./>surp surplus
<$A> Yes
<$B> There was no surplus
<$A> It was
<$B> There was no surplus
<$A> <./>Sup
<$B> surplus
<$A> Give me spelling here
<$B> S U 
<$A> S
<$B> S U R P 
<$A> Oh this one
<$B> Yes
<$A> What is this Okay there was no surplus There was no surplus Okay There was no surplus How could the lack of surplus facilitate the collapse Can you tell How did absence of surplus facilitate the collapse 
<$B> Since there was no surplus between the mass population the increase of population so it led it <-/leds> to famine
<$A> So what was the outcomes <-/>mhm
<$B> Let me <-_>let me<-/> finish When the hunger happened there were some people who were owning the surplus and so people who were <O/> they came to them
<$A> Any other thing to contribute Yes
<$B> Specialisation
<$A> <-/>mhm You tell me this is a reason for collapse
<$B> Yes
<$A> No there was no specialisation How did you tell this
<$B> Specialisation is the a what a communal mode of production 
<$A> A communal mode of production
<$B> Actually uh there was specialisation but after that specialisation came into the into another stage whereby other specialisation didn't it didn't benefit some group of people For example there were some groups who were only uh <-_>who were only<-/> gatherers while others were toolmakers so we can see that the toolmakers became somehow somewhat They had wealth so the groups started
<$A> Do you get the point of what our friend is saying 
<$?> Yes
<$A> So this specialisation created an ample room for some people to own means of production and others not for those for instance those <O/> who gathered <O_><O/> because they didn't settle after all they were just moving here and there looking for what they can consume While these ones who settled uh involved themselves in some activities such as those ones our friend have mentioned so there was now creation of surplus Any other thing you can see that that can be the reason Now let me give you a question We still have some tribes in Tanzania such as Masai and we have another group that <name/> they are more or less the same because they are farming the same region 
<$B> Sandawe 
<$A> Sandawe more or less the same people I know Sandawe is Kiswahili
<$B> <O/>
<$A> <-/>mhm
<$B> <O/>
<$A> Give me the spelling
<$B>A R B A 
<$A> A
<$B> <-/>uhu
<$B> N
<$A> N That one
<$B> I
<$A> That one
<$B> I
<$A> This One
<$B> G G 
<$A> Instead of this one
<$B> Yes
<$A> From where
<$B> From <name/>
<$A> But now the southern part of Africa Which one
<$B> Bushmen
<$A> <-/>Uhu bushmen Okay in the explanations about specialisation you said that some people specialised in gathering and hunting uh while others settled and started to do some activities Hence it resulted into the acquisition of wealth What about these people What about these people in Tanzania and in the southern part of Africa We know that these people are just nearby societies which are civilised Okay
<$?> Yes
<$A> What is the problem of these people I think it's induced with knowledge of gathering and hunting or depending on nature <O_><O/> What is the reason behind anyway Who can try to find out what can be the reason why these people are still relying on nature while they have some societies which are advanced and are civilised just nearby them Why are they going on procuring They are going on procuring They depend <./>so <-_>they depend<-/> solely on nature Why Is there any reason We bring them schools in order to be civilised they run away towards the bushes You build them houses still they can't live in our houses our modern houses What do you think can be the reason They are still in communal mode of production <-/>mhm I remember one year the government built a school for those people to get educated and built houses for those people to live but no one from those responded and they were taken by force to live in those houses but sometimes later nobody was found there They ran away Can you tell me the reason Yes
<$B> Maybe I'll just try 
<$A> Yes
<$B> Maybe they because they come from local place
<$A> What
<$B> Local <-/>local community
<$A> Our friend thinks they are going to make local <O/>
<$B> I think these people will just fight such a system mode of production so once they <O/> let's say you bring them for example here at school they can't live here because this place differs from where they are living in their forests
<$A> But we are still scrutinising their satisfaction Why are they satisfied with that situation
<$B> I hope they lean so much on their tradition
<$A> Our friend hopes that they lean very much on their tradition
<$B> Probably they are hunters 
<$A> They
<$B> Hunters They hunt so they prefer hunting 
<$A> Yes but why are they going on hunting They can't stop hunting uh Why We brought them school and modern buildings in order to <-/>to separate them from that situation of going on hunting but they still absconded our buildings and went into the bushes <name/>
<$B> Maybe they are primitive
<$A> They are primitive Yes Okay conclusively the reason as to why these people are satisfied with this situation is that Had it been that these people liked the complexity of life <O_><O/> Everything is available for these people Animals are were there Fruits are there and roots Everything is there In case animals finished these people could shift Okay Yes
<$B> Why did they not stop when they had a chance
<$A> Why did they not stop when they had a chance
<$B> Yes
<$A> I have said that the complexity of life For instance in other places people went on hunting
S1B003T
<$A> Okay I hope you are all fine and some of you I have met already And uh as I can remember we last time were able to cover the book and the theme not the themes but character I mean the plot as well as uh the setting I think you remember that So uh can you remind me uh anything that we said on the setting the setting because today we shall be able to discuss uh Yes we were able to cover with you the setting as well as the plot What did we say was the setting of the dilemma of a ghost the dilemma of a ghost Can you remind me of that Yes The dilemma of a ghost what did we say What did we say was the setting of this play
<$B> It is in a very broad form
<$A> Yes
<$B> The setting is in a very broad form
<$A> uh in a very broad form uh So what is it about What is the setting I mean where are we told this play was uh constructed How uh was it prepared and so on Where was it acted uh Yes
<$B> In Ghana
<$A> Yes we are told that play is uh about Ghana a Ghanaian you remember who that Ghanaian is okay and then uh where is it being acted yes yes
<$B> Somewhere in the continent of America
<$A> Yeah it starts right uh somewhere in the continent of <-/>of America where two graduates are discussing 
<$B> <O/>
<$A> <O/> two graduates are discussing some affairs about how they will be looking like when they go back to Ghana Okay And then it is acted outside the the traditional house Okay uh in the courtyard Okay You remember that And then what did we say is the plot uh What did you say is the plot of this play the plot You remember what a plot is uh the time span covered throughout the whole play uh
<$B> It took place for about one year and two weeks 
<$A> Sure it is uh it took place for about it is acted uh in a period of one year and two weeks about and it is stated in the book I think we were able to cite uh where the writer tries to <-/>to tell us the time it takes uh to act this play Now today we are going to look at themes Themes as well as characterisation Yes I asked you to go and prepare some answers but then before you start presenting your answer I mean presenting I would want to explain to you what themes are When you read any work of art be it a novel a play uh or even poems uh when we talk of themes we mean the main ideas of the work of art the main ideas What are the main ideas found in any work of art uh What do does the uh uh <-/>the author or the writer want uh <-/>want to say want to convey to us So those are known as themes in just simple terms Okay Then when we talk of characterisation we actually mean uh what uh everything that is said by the characters how they have been used by the author to convey the <./>me message he wants to put across Okay So here we come out with the idea of main character minor characters and so on Are we together
<$B> Yes
<$A> Now <-/>now that you know what themes are and what <./>character uh characterisation is I think you are able to in your groups to come and present uh or even no you can do it where you are but it could be a good idea if you sit in your groups Okay Now who were assigned to present uh on themes who were assigned to present on themes uh yes Who else Nobody else Yes you Okay you were three four One is missing it seems Where is Pauline Moses sick uh She is at home Okay Now uh can you come closer and maybe have a common seat somewhere so that you can present it and you'll be asked questions and I think you can be in a position to answer uh Okay But you shouldn't feel afraid One of you who is the chairperson Who is the chairperson of the group uh So can you please present where you are Just stay where you are to avoid some inconveniences
<$B>
<$A> Are you through Get seated Yes Any question to what he has just presented How many themes have you mentioned 
<$B> Two themes
<$A> Two themes The first one The first theme Yes his good mates I think you can try to assist him You can assist him because he is not supposed to speak alone You have to work as a team Yes uh The first theme yes What has he mentioned as the first theme 
<$B> Dilemma
<$A> The theme of dilemma good What <-/>what is there Very good What is there in the theme of dilemma uh What makes it a dilemma What is a dilemma Actually I think you know what a dilemma is Yes Who can tell me Who can tell us what a dilemma is yes
<$B> Traditional education
<$A> Traditional education That is something that causes a dilemma part of the <./>mai character uh traditional education What does it do What does traditional education do to cause a dilemma uh <O/> Can you tell us what the tradition does I mean what traditional education does to Ato in such a way that he's found a dilemma
<$B> It makes him argue with his wife 
<$A> uh yeah So dilemma you know what it is When Once a person is pulled on both sides When a person is pulled on both sides uh Say he has got to achieve this and he has got to achieve this one here so he is standing here inbetween uh He can't go in that way in the other way and that way He <-/>he wants to go to this direction at the same time he wants to even maintain this direction So this is you are saying western culture isn't it Western education education and then here you have what else here You have traditional customs isn't it So actually this is Ato He doesn't want to offend his parents Okay and at the same time he doesn't want to do away with western education This actually keeps him in dilemma uh So you see and uh what makes it that I mean who can try to justify this dilemma uh Where is it said like this uh Where do we see ever expression indicating dilemma of that sort uh I think you mentioned it You mentioned somewhere if I was fully aware You mentioned uh something like when uh Ato's mother brought the snails uh uh as a reward to her uh <-_>to her<-/> <-/>her children uh and what did Yurani say uh uh regarding those rewards What did Yurani say <-/>say uh
<$B> She <-/>she was disgusted
<$A> She was disgusted and she <-/>she rejected those snails and they said after all seeing snails and eating snails are two different things I may have seen snails at home in <-/>in United States but it doesn't mean I have eaten them So she threw them away isn't it So uh but when Ato is asked about this incident what does he say He tries to defend the United States After all he doesn't know how to cope with them you see So that means trying to defend what western culture because uh Ato's mother thought that all those rewards could be accepted without any question But you see uh they are rejected altogether And then here again he tries to defend western culture And now again on the other example what does uh You mentioned it also that Yurani is married She hasn't <-_>she hasn't<-/> given birth to any child Okay And now what does uh uh what do the <./>par I mean Ato's uh relatives say about this What do they say Yes the group neighbours
<$B> They want to wash the womb
<$A> They want to wash Yurani's womb isn't it And what does he <-/>does <./>Yur Is Yurani ready I mean ready to be washed
<$B> No
<$A> She is not ready Okay But then what does Ato say about Yurani's barrenness Is he happy about the situation uh What does he say
<$B> <O/>
<$A> He might have said Oh what's wrong with my wife So he doesn't agree with the concept of washing you know the idea of washing uh Yurani's stomach and what not After all uh both Yurani and Ato don't find it barrenness anyway They say they haven't yet decided to get the kid isn't it 
<$B> Yes
<$A> That's what they said So again we find even in a certain instance where Ato I mean Yurani insults uh Ato's relatives What does she say about Ato's uh relatives brothers and uncles uh Yes
<$B> They are uncivilised
<$A> They yeah She says they are uncivilised And what does Ato do uh responding to such kind of a thing 
<$B> He slaps her 
<$A> He slaps her So you see this is another <O/> you know Despite the fact that there is love between Ato and uh Yurani they <./>th <-/>they reach a point where Ato defends Yurani and at the same time uh Ato uh tries to even grow negative against Yurani For example when he <-_>when he<-/> slaps her uh <-_>when he slaps her<-/> This indicates that he is angered with what he was saying okay she was saying So this is a dilemma he doesn't know where to go He wants to go this way but he fails He wants to go that way he fails So he is somewhere inbetween Can you tell me another another theme That was one theme Another theme Yes
<$B> the theme of conflict
<$A> Yes very good The theme of conflict How does uh <-_>how does<-/> the author uh explain uh this theme How does he explain the theme Can you tell me uh Can you explain Yes we know there is a theme of conflict but uh how is it being explained So there is a theme here of dilemma Then there is a theme of conflict What is said on this theme of conflict Yes I think you have read this uh and I told you to go and prepare this Yes What uh does the author say uh to show the conflict that is found in the in the book Think if you got uh yes
<$B> It started from the time they returned to the village
<$A> Yes uh Just as Ato visits I mean Ato and his wife decided to go back to their village is when we see uh the conflicts But what do this uh what is the conflict all about uh I think you remember that there is This Ato is a Ghanaian who has uh got a European I mean Western education Okay And then his wife also is a graduate also <-_>He<+_She> completed his her <-/>her uh degree course there in America isn't it and now uh Yurani is he's an Afro-American isn't it and then Ato is a Ghanaian person So once they come back from their workplace they come to pay visit to their village Ato's village we find that from the beginning that the ways that the ways of life that are there in Ato's village are different from the ways of life that are in America you see And this is what makes Ato uh fail to even cope with the lifestyles of the village there and it also makes Yurani very uh difficult to understand these things So he throws away those snails Okay it's one sign of conflict And then uh what else do we see She insults <-_>she insults<-/> uh Ato's parents So we see the conflict between traditional again it is traditional ways of life ways against <-/>against western ways <-/>ways of life But then if I asked you uh if I were to ask you can you tell me uh what are those traditional ways of life found in Ghana for example can you mention them uh as far as your understanding is concerned Can you try What are the traditional ways of life there in Ghana uh What are those traditional ways of life Yes
<$B> Barrenness is treated there
<$A> Yes barrenness is treated as a case Actually it's treated as a case and it's not even well taken in that society So they believe that once people are married they should bare children They don't have any idea of you know family planning and so on Any other things Thank you Any other
S1B004T
<$A> some historical aspects which have to deal first with because it's all history So with concepts of history we're definitely going to discuss about class production relation and modes of production Class production relation and modes of production So we shall start directly to define some concepts in this topic The first concept we should define is production
<$A> Yes
<$A> Yes come in
<$B> Good morning Sir
<$A> Good morning So this topic is very important because any human being any human <./>bei <-/>human being needs in order to survive he needs three main things or in order to survive he needs three essential things What are they who can mention one Yes <name/> 
<$B> Food shelter
<$A> I said who can mention one Okay Food The other <-/>mhm
<$B> Shelter
<$A> Shelter <-/>mhm The last
<$B> Clothes
<$A> Clothes Good So all these will basically come as a result of work or as a result of labour So human being in the first time of his existence he found that he was <-/subjecteded> to the work and he was therefore in an attempt to struggle against two things In the first place the first human being struggled against two things Who can try to mention one thing things maybe the first human struggled against mmh
<$B> Struggled to get food
<$A> Struggled to get food Struggled to get food
<$B> Good morning Sir
<$A> Good morning <-/>mhm Another thing Yes try
<$B> He struggled to change his environment
<$A> struggled to change his environment struggled to change his environment <-/>mhm Now what can we do with these things is that the first man struggled in the first place against nature Okay He struggled against nature and struggling against nature is where the results of <O/> today That human being had to survive and surviving needed him to <-/>to possess food and to possess food needed him to involve himself in labour to produce so that he can gain some food So that was in the first place In the second place man was subjected in a position to struggle against his fellow man his fellow colleague So you find that man was subjected to nature and to his fellow man So after that is when after finishing that then we can proceed with giving some divisions to our terminologies or concepts
<$B> Please Sir
<$A> Yes
<$B> You have said that the man struggled against nature and then secondly his fellow man 
<$A> Yes
<$B> his fellow man how
<$A> Okay this man Anyway secondly before going back to answering the question of our fellow explained who can try to think about how man can struggle against man Who can try to find something how man can struggle against another man <-/>mhm Anyone who can try Okay this man has to struggle to get relations Okay Relations between man or between man to man or relations among men <-/>mhm Who can tell me that all the members of the class are his friends Is there anybody who exists who can tell me that all of <-/>of these members of class are his friends is it 
<$B> Yes
<$A> They are your friends
<$B> Yes
<$A> But you definitely must have a friend of yours who is closer than others isn't it That is one kind of relation <-/>mhm That's one kind of relation Am I wrong
<$?> No
<$A> That is one kind of relation But in the other way you will have some members of your class who not like you or not love you Not necessarily that they can show you that they don't love you but they are there and they don't love you So that is still a relationship isn't it 
<$?> Yes
<$A> So you have all kinds of relationship So in the first place there was the human being had to struggle to get harmonious or friendly relationship uh to his fellow man In the second place these people as they went on producing they found themselves that some were having new products others were not having products And I don't think if there is a good relationship or friendly relationship between the one who is rich and the one who is poor Is that not true Do we have harmonious or friendly relationship between those two <./>pe kind of people
<$?> No
<$A> We don't have So these people were struggling against harmonious relationship which later has resulted into the formation of disharmonious or unfriendly relationship I think I have answered the question
<$B> Yes Sir
<$A> Any addition any addition because I might have left some <-/>some points and people who feel that I have left some points they can add Is there anything else I have forgotten So we said that two productive forces I think and probably it is definitely true that this is not the first place or the first time you see this terminology isn't it I presume that this is not the first time you see this terminology Who can try to define what are the productive forces Who can try to define what are the productive forces <-/>mhm Who can try Anybody Yes Try
<$B> Productive forces in my consideration I consider that they are those facilities used in production
<$A> Good try Anybody who can try Anybody else who can try What are the productive forces What are the productive forces Yes 
<$B> I hope productive forces are those factors which are concerned in the creation of material
<$A> Yes It's very good <-/>mhm
<$B> Productive forces are the forces which are used in production of materials
<$A> Very good Okay I think through or by observing those three views we can simply say that man has necessarily to live basically depending on producing food uh preparing shelter for his uh protection and clothes So because he wants these things he has to involve himselves to find the productive forces things that can facilitate him to obtain these things Okay So productive forces are the things which can facilitate the activity of man to achieve these uh three essentials Any other view concerning the productive forces Who can mention any way Who can try to give the examples of the what can be productive forces <-/>mhm I'm not interested in the one hand <-/>mhm Yes try
<$B> Land
<$A> Land <-/>mhm
<$B> Human labour
<$A> Human labour <-/>mhm Try
<$B> Capital
<$A> Capital <-/>mhm Any other example Yes
<$B> Enterpreneurship
<$A> Enterpreneurship Any other example <-/>mhm Any other example apart from those given those on the blackboard <-/>mhm Yes
<$B> Specialization
<$A> Specialization <-/>mhm I <-/>I <-/>I saw another hand just behind you <-/>mhm Somebody was raising his hand <-/>mhm So 
<$B> Yes Sir
<$A> Yes
<$B> I think you do have <O/> which are which is the productive process but I think some of us have given a lot of definitions but we're coming to this <O/> where you <-/>you have been saying that yes we could try try try but we don't know which is new 
<$A> about productive <./>for forces
<$B> Yes because I don't know which because there were great divisions so I don't know which is which 
<$A> I think in the after the definitions of from your colleagues I said that productive forces are things which facilitate the <O/> Okay So I said isn't it Only that you say you were busy so that you I said that productive forces are the things which facilitate a human being to acquire or obtain his basic needs You remember So it is for <-_>it is<-/> not for the benefit of our friend but even those that are <O/> here So after having seen what we can say about productive forces let's try to find some other possible concepts within the major concept of productive process There is one concept under productive process which is human labour Human labour <-_>Human labour<-/> I think human labour is supposed to be the component of the productive process It is the component or it is just one one among many which compose the productive process as in the definition some of our colleagues where I said that enterpreneurship specialization all those kinds will be found in the course of our discussion on human labour So who can try to tell what can be uh what you can say about human labour or in terms of defining or giving some sort of expressions what you can say What can you say about human labour Giving expressions or descriptions or even if possible to tell the definition <-/>mhm
<$B> Human labour we can say is refered to as the form of work in production
<$A> The form of work in order to produce <-/>mhm Okay He has given such a definition Who can try Another one who can try <-/>mhm Another else Try
<$B> Human labour is energy or ability 
<$A> Energy or 
<$B> ability
<$A> ability <-/>mhm 
<$B> <O/>
<$A> <-/>mhm Yes Okay human labour includes or in the first place human labour Yes labour is a purposeful or is a <./>purpos a purposeful or intended activity done by human being which depends on a skill or man experience scientific and technical knowledge So human labour is as I have said is an intended activity done by human being and it is basically depending on skill experience <./>experi experience uh and scientific and technical knowledge For all those ones who might not have heard it properly it is an intended activity directed at the production it is an intended activity directed at the production of the necessary product and it is solely dependent on these factors skill experience scientific and technical knowledge Anybody who has a different concept or a different idea uh <-/>different idea from those ones which are given on the blackboard Anybody else who has something to add or something to express in addition to the subject Anybody So this one is clear It is clear
<$?>Yes
<$A> So after that let's go to another concept Objects of labour <-_>Objects of labour<-/> Who can try to think about what is what can object of labour mean Who can try to tell us what he feels this can be <-/>mhm Anyone who can try Yes
<$B> Uh Instruments which can be used to simplify a certain human activity 
<$A> Yes any other Any other Any other Try You can try Who else can try <-/>mhm Are you satisfied with the <-/>the expressions of our colleague Are you satisfied 
<$B> Yes
<$A> So you want to say that what your colleague was thinking you as well were thinking it isn't it uh Who was seriously thinking another way different from <-_>different from<-/> our fellow's expressions <-/>mhm So you were thinking the same thing all of you Is it 
<$B> Yes
<$A> uh Who was thinking the other way round Tell what you were thinking or what you think Tell what you think Yes
<$B> Object of labour are facilities to which the human skill and experience are directed
<$A> <-/>mhm This is another fair definition <-/>mhm Someone was raising his hand We contribute various views
<$B> Object of labour includes man and his <O/>
<$A> Yes and still other views are here mh Any other contribution Yes
<$B> I think object of labour is any human activity to maximize production
<$A> To maximize production Okay Objects of labour are the things which are subjected to man's labour Objects of labour are the things which are subjected to man's labour <-/>mhm An example of a thing which can be subjected to man's labour Who can tell us what is that Yes
<$B> Land is one of those
<$A> Land good land is something which is subjected to man's labour Good So land is the most important object of labour which is subjected to man <-/>mhm Who has some other views different from these ones <-/>mhm Is this clear 
<$?> Yes
<$A> It's important to note that these objects of labour are the things which are subjected to man's labour A good example is land Okay
<$?> Yes
<$A> Let us shift to another <-/>another concept This is means of labour I hope you can see what I write You can see
<$?> Yes
<$A> Means of labour If we have discussed about human labour objects of labour what can be an appropriate expressions for means of labour What can be an appropriate expression for means of labour <-/>mhm Means of labour <-_>Means of labour<-/> <name/> Yes
<$B> Means of labour are the things which human being having a human labour and object of labour can produce
<$A> Yes it is fairly good Yes
<$B> Are the way from which he can obtain labour force
<$A> The ways from which he can obtain labour force Any other different view from those two views given by our colleagues 
S1B005T
<$?> This was the first general workshop among five workshops to be held throughout the island The purpose of this workshop is to train the science and maths teachers on how to use enquiry method in teaching science and maths in Zanzibar However the science and maths books on enquiry method produced in June workshop nineteen ninety-three were also on <O/>
<$A> So when we go to the workshop room or working room we see so many materials in front of us in our rooms and the problem will be posed there on that particular topic that you will be required to investigate After posing the problem then we go to another stage which is formation of questions After being supplied with materials you will have to look to the material and form as many questions as possible on those particular materials that you have been provided So those questions which you will look at have to investigate on them So after posing the questions then you will have to do activities which include investigations You will do observation while doing the activities From there you will be <-_>you will be<-/> required to record whatever you see Record the observation whatever you see while you are doing whatever is happening A lot of things might happen while you are interacting with materials After recording then we come to report You will have to report whatever is happening in that 
<$B> In fact now Group A B and C will remain in this room D E and F
<$C> Seeds and other materials were provided
<$D> You will be provided with a variety of and we them 
<$E> Varieties of seeds and the answer we observe thirteen varieties of <-/>of seeds
<$F> Some seeds have got two cotyledons and some seeds have got uh one cotyledon
<$E> The external structure of seed consisted three parts and the first one micropyle responsible for the <O/> of water and scar uh for example in <-_bean><+_beans> there are various sizes of seeds Some show small sizes second one shows <./>media <./>media medium sizes and some the large size
<$F> uh On measuring we found that the size of a coconut uh a groundnut it has uh it is one point eight <-_centimetre><+_centimetres> long We found that some uh crushed <-/>crushed the seeds in some solutions and see what happens when uh uh what result we get
<$E> The seeds they take to germinate 
<$?> Reporting time The groups reported what they have seen and observed
<$D> Generally we found that all the seeds all seeds have xylem they have micropyle Some are easily seen and some are not until you are going to use uh I mean a scientific uh uh instrument to <O/> and they all have seed coats Then we tried to look at the internal structure of some seeds We <-/>we look on uh maize and at beans Maize has monocot and beans has <./>di dicot So in <-/>in maize we found that the seed after remaining the seed coat or after <-/>after dissecting it <-_>dissecting it<-/> <-_>dissecting it<-/> we found that maize has one cotyledon Plumule and radicle are not easily seen They are present but they are not easily seen and cotyledons are hard to split I mean that if you want that if you want to split cotyledons you can see that it is hard but on the side of uh beans <O/> we found that it contains two cotyledons Plumule and radicle are easily seen so that they are easily to split uh Here the coconut and the groundnut uh If I want to split you can see it is easily to be split Then into the background to show the external and internal structures of the bean splits Here bean's uh xylem micropyle and seed coats then dissect uh dissect it and find the <O/> plumule and cotyledons External structure this is internal structure then we tried to do maize by iodine We tried to <O/> We found that the external uh <O/> xylem position of embryo and the position of cotyledon and also of scar and internal <O/> there is endosperms <O/> scar <O/> radicle plumule and <O/>
<$G> uh If am right <-_>If I am right<-/> on what I hear from you uh you said that uh coconuts store water
<$D> Yah
<$G> Did you test for that How did you test
<$D>uh I ground them Then <-/>then I found there is water
<$G> Really
<$D> Really
<$G> Is water
<$D> Yes
<$G> Did you boil it
<$D> I didn't but <-/>but I saw water
<$G> That is not water
<$D> I saw
<$G> uh The last question Did you said that you said that you removed air
<$D> <-/>Uha
<$G> in the test tube by using caustic soda Is that right
<$D> <-/>Uha
<$G> What I know is that you can remove carbon dioxide by using caustic soda and not air
<$D> This may indeed be true
<$G> Is that the external structure of seeds consist three parts and the first one micropyle responsible for <?/>interraise of water uh scar uh for example in beans appears as a white <O/> and the uh surrounding coat known as dicot
<$C> One among the methods in which is used to preserve food from to preserve uh seeds is by smoking How smoke help to preserve food 
<$E> A crop for example maize uh anything 
<$A> Other questions are too far from where we are going
<$?> Okay
<$B> and actually we are 
<$A> in the sense that what he has presented is from their own experience They never did it practically during the activity So we cannot ask too far in the background in its information 
<$C> What happens when light falls uh on the <-/>the breaking surface Well there <-/>there is a tension somewhere in the
<$H> tested us was when we are dealing with these we have seen some interesting things Those we have seen that when we look at them <-_>we look at them<-/> we saw some silvery colour instead of being colourless like this or greenish like this we can see some as silvery part here For example at the base at their bases so we <-_wonders><+_wonder> where does this come from and also we tried to take them when I put them on the words given we put the words here and the words here there and <-_sudden><+_suddenly> we saw some strange things Instead of seeing UN we saw that the thing like this and so that image was very interesting to us We ask ourselves where does this come from but the answer could not come into our minds and we get the same thing on the word BE but reflected in other way like this and the picture came this way But we want our teachers to help us This is from my observations I hope it is a sort of various types or various reflections and one of these comments was that here there was a sort of <O/> and this <-/>this one the second one and the third one I understand as the first the second the third in the other side That is what I observed and what uh have <./>gi <-/>have given me a sort of idea it is caused by combination of reflections
<$I> There is a real position of the objects inside the vessel here as we used it uh If someone can't see the diagram I think you can see this uh This is the real position at the bottom of the container or at the bottom of this beaker but if someone tries to observe where it is where is it inside by looking above the liquid he probably will see that the object is <-_near><+_nearer> than the real position 
<$A> This direction please so that everybody can see you 
<$I> Please point it Where is it like that Once please Oh good very good Oh no
<$A> This is where I see him
<$I> Okay Now please look it please this way Is it there
<$H> No it isn't
<$I> It is here we have pictures of <-_>we have pictures of<-/> concave convex thick glass block and prism Formation of image on lens If rays come and fall <-_>and fall<-/> on concave the image <-_come><+_comes> up down like this on picture uh while on concave no image form In glass block some of rays few weak <-_ray><+_rays> reflect strong rays passing through The uh prisms <-/>prisms they are <-_>they are<-/> <./>passi they are penetrate and the uh colour are <./>see <-_>colour are<-/> seen
<$J> When uh <-/>when we have a point source of light and uh from that point we can to have want to If we have a bulb we can find that the <-/>the light rays are coming from the bulb and they find uh some direction Now at that direction we say they diverge from the point uh The rays are diverging They are coming from the point and find various uh directions so we say they diverge Now coming to the point of conversion We reverse the <-/>the rays let us say for example the rays which are coming from certain <-_>from certain<-/> point or source and coming to the to the concave lens let us say concave mirror they reflect back Now the reflected rays seem to come at a point after the reflection so the coming at a point we say they converge
<$K> is with all these liquids dissolve all materials provided that is I mean salt sugar salt liquids are used
<$L> There are visible liquids and invisible liquids
<$J> In fact what we did we tried to find uh what <-/>what liquid is denser than the other so we took the liquids randomly uh First of all we took uh some water we put it and then we took some milk we put it we found that uh milk go down then the water was lighter Then we took honey we put on top we found that honey go down pushes up milk and water and so we continued until we found we <-/>we <-/>we finished all liquids Then we found that the residues are as follows At the bottom there's honey then follows milk then after milk there is a mixture of tap water distilled water and I think that there was another liquid which was uh coconut juice uh We took this position
<$M> I have two questions First what do you mean by the pungent smell B you said that alcohol is bitter Did you test it or did you give the answer from your uh your experience
<$J> We tested by means of uh ordinary test organs that is tongue and Daudu tested
<$N> From my experience that we are playing with them we are working with them and we have never seen hurt some hurt or any dangerous things that has happened before so we take it for granted that they are not dangerous In case of testing and not drinking 
<$B> For this particular exercise we are all learners and we think with them all we have identified so we know which is which and we know that we can taste them safely But if you are to perform this same activity with children you have to be more careful The choice of materials will matter a lot when you are working with different groups of people For example if you are working with children you wouldn't have uh acid as acid or alkali things like sodium hydroxide or nitric oxide things like that because kids are liable to taste anything placed in front of them So maybe you could choose things like uh lemon juice uh orange juice milk things which are safe Thank you Mr Chairman 
<$L> When you meet the materials you come to notice that there are certain materials which are magnetic and some of the materials are not magnetic
<$L> In this experiment magnets separate iron filing from the mixture
<$L> We took a battery wire and a nail We coiled a nail by <./>u
<$L> that electricity can be used to make a magnet and the paper 
<$L> A magnet had brought close to the nail and it was attracted After that the nail become induced and attract razor blade and the razor blade also were induced and then attract before <O/> After suspending the magnet we observed that they formed a very long chain and from this conclusion from that we observed that magnetic materials magnetic material uh <-_>magnetic material<-/> the source of magnet passed through magnetic material
<$E> We bring a magnet that is a side of a magnet to a side of another magnet First we see uh we saw that one magnet attracted to another magnet and diagram two as it's shown in on the paper the magnet shows to repel that is this side uh turn to the opposite and the uh the side here turn into this way We conclude that friend side attract and then enemy repel here 
S1B006T
<$A> Now in this session we are going to have something different from presentation from working with materials and from all what we did within the last few or three or four days So in this session we are going to uh summarize look at what we did try to discuss some few issues you are we together and then may be concretise our four days uh stand and working here at Utaani So to start with I'm welcoming the co-ordinator of the uh Science camp and also the director the second director of the uh science and technology department to give us all what he has Welcome Mr Hussein 
<$B> Thank you very much indeed to them they are uh all teachers all of them together All of us here are participants Well before going actually what into what I'm expected to <-/>to present here first of all I'll have I must say thank you to all participants <-/>participants for good work that we have come out after four or five days of interruptions here between people and people between people and material They have been very active interactions and I'm sure the <-_unit><+_units> that have been written now will come out as uh documents that will help us in our work later in the classrooms when we go back into our schools and I'm sure that these documents uh The office will work uh extremely hard to have them out as soon as possible so that uh we can use them as uh reference materials to our work in the schools So with that I must say thank you to all participants uh It is actually all of us here who are facilitators it was beyond our expectation that uh <-/>that uh people would be able to work so hard so intelligently as we have been doing You deserve congratulations all of you
It might also that <-_>It might also<-/> be that some of us have applied this approach in our day-to-day teaching and also it is possible that some of us have never used this approach in our teaching in the classroom So we tried to give a questionnaire We gave a questionnaire yesterday and uh thirty-three people responded to that questionnaire or in other words evaluation form and I tried to go through the questionnaire and tried to summarize what you yourself commented on what you did in five days So the most interesting question to me and probably to my colleagues also were Do we have a specimen of that questionnaire What did you like about this workshop and what you didn't like about this workshop These were very very important questions to us here as facilitators and they were also very important questions to you yourself participants but unfortunately uh most people didn't respond much in this uh Some people just put dash in that Some people say what you did like about this yes and what you didn't like about this workshop no That doesn't tell us anything or we have to investigate into that We have to do more inquiries into those answers Actually they couldn't help us much in getting a feedback from you actually Those were very important very crucial questions to you that we were expecting you to respond But however some gave their responses and I'm quite happy to read them before you and the first question what did you like about the workshop I translated <-_>I translated<-/> that question into another form why we need inquiry Why we need inquiry approach It is almost synonymous to that why what did you like about this workshop Definitely you will point out a number of issues a number of things that interested you while you were in this workshop beside those of meals tea break and other things jokes that were highlighted during the presentations during the discussions during the workshop So the first they are the main source of inquiry approach All those that said you liked them definitely they are the good side of the inquiry approach And in other words we can say those are the merits of the inquiry approach So listen to your response on the inquiry approach What did you say about it What are <-_>What are<-/> the good sides of the inquiry approach You say one it facilitates exchange of materials ideas This is what you have said It facilitates exchange of ideas and materials and that is very true We have been exchanging ideas in the groups while doing activities and also during presentations we have been all the time we have been most of the time exchanging ideas and material between ourselves as learners because we are all learners You said that learners become creative <O_><O/> and actually you were very very creative You were designing You were devising all sorts of methods ways and means to solve problems For instance today here this morning these people demonstrated to us how they could measure the size of the image to the size of the object That is creativity Maybe some of us we didn't know before how actually to measure that but there is just a simple method using ruler and pencil to measure the size of the image and the size of the object That is clear Then they said students <O_><O/> Of course as you have said that syllabus has to be consider they are very long and I think they have been So actually of course when you go back to your schools you won't teach you won't select topics from nowhere You will be selecting topics from your syllabus So at least we are happy that you know this that you will have to consider your syllabus so we are in a very good position Another thing is arrange participants on subject-based groups but very few commented on this I think only one or two Arrange participants on subject-based groups Well actually one of the tricks of the inquiry approach is to facilitate learning between the learners You as a facilitator the teacher you have to facilitate learning between the groups so for instance here in this workshop we say okay you sit as biology teachers you this group as physics teacher this group as maths teacher So the biology teacher has given light the topic light I think it won't have been appropriate actually in giving <O_><O/> But the way you were you were sharing experiences One who knows gives his experience or her experience or that is shared to those who maybe didn't have that idea You discuss round that idea So the sharing of experience is very vital in the inquiry method and <O_><O/> I just want <-_>I just want<-/> good readers from Pemba We have more time and less time 
<$C> Okay thank you for the <?/>conversation I at the same time disagree I agree that much time has been consumed as I said before at the initial stage the stage when you are prepared the stage when you are learning how to use the inquiry approach but once you are familiar with the approach and you already know what you want to do then time consumption becomes very much excess That is one side of this <-_>of this<-/> point The other side of this point I'm sure we as teachers we have an examination and syllabus uh disease I call it <-_>I call it<-/> a syndrome The syllabus syndrome it is an examination syndrome and therefore our languages will cover the syllabus to meet the examination requirement demands And with that syndrome in mind that is why we are rushing We are rushing We are running after the topics the topic without bearing in mind whether our kids understand or not whether you are imparting a true and an appropriate knowledge or not whether what you are doing is has any kind of application to the future <-/>future life of your students You don't bear in mind You are You say in your mind that  it's none of my business whether they understand or not I'm just starting to finish the syllabus There is one saying and I got this when I was in Nigeria first year first time One of the professors said he was trying to demonstrate and I'm standing up to demonstrate if I can help He was trying to demonstrate Do you know what you mean by covering the syllabus and we said this is covering the syllabus When you cover the syllabus what do you mean You close it and so no one can see what is the syllabus You are covering the syllabus and so that nobody can see and he said and I quote that let us keep the syllabus open so that everybody can see what is in the syllabus What do you mean by seeing what is in the syllabus Teaching <-/>Teaching with the aim of making our students understand what we are teaching what you are teaching and if I can quote professor He also gave a very good example of holding a young child the two arms getting him to stand on his feet and once you leave the arms of the child what will happen He will fall down That is what we are doing We are rushing for having the examination our students cram whatever you give them They reproduce during the examinations 
<$D> Dear teacher have you attended any science workshop before
<$E> On my part I have attended <-_>I have attended two times<-/> in eighteen eighty-nine as well as in nineteen ninety-two 
<$F> This is my first time to attend this science workshop 
<$G> On my part this is the second time to attend this science workshop At one time it was in eighteen eighty-nine and now it is nineteen ninety-two ninety-three
<$D> Do you think that this workshop is useful to you and the society in general
<$E> On my own behalf I think that this workshop is very useful to the student as well as to the society because it makes the student or one who <-_>take<+_takes> this method learns by observing the specimen given learn how to raise <-_question><+_questions> as well as planning how to experiment the experiment then experimenting In doing so he learns by creating direct experience and skill from the specimen provided 
<$D> How
<$E> By doing such experiments by himself He learns by creating direct experience from the experiment he is performing or he is experimenting 
<$D> Do you have any suggestions on the improvement of the science workshop in the future
<$F> uh yes I have suggestions First of all science workshop should be carried at least twice a year and instead of having one zone in one region we should sub-divide one region into areas For example in this North Pemba region we should have at least two zones whereby the workshop to be conducted Second instead of just assembling secondary schoolteachers we also try to also <-/>to include primary schoolteachers because also science begins at the primary level
<$D> Is the approach applicable to <./>you <-/>to your students
<$F> Yes this approach is very applicable to students Though it has some defects on it but by learning the learner gets a permanent learning Since he is doing the experiment by himself he is learning how to observe he is trying to formulate or to frame out the question how to frame a good question so he is learning and he is getting a very permanent uh learning and what he <-_do><+_does> or what he does or what she does stays for long time in his mind Though it has some difficulties For example the teacher or the conductor of the experiment sometimes who <./>ha he has to have a good financial strength or financial constraint though the method is taking a longer time as well as in our class we have a dense population so in order to do <./>su such the teacher has to look forward on these three problems Then he can do it but it's very applicable and it is a very good approach 
<$D> What do you comment on the inquiry approach
<$E> Science is a process and science is also a progress meaning we have to leave out the old traditional method and try to follow the modern method One of the modern <-_method><+_methods> the discovery of better right the inquiry method This should be conducted in schools first of all as Mr Khamis said it's makes learning permanent and also the modern way of teaching is to make pupils or students participate in the lesson So inquiry method welcomes students to take part in the lesson So they do things by themselves uh When doing things by themselves it takes longer time to forget than just traditional  method of just chalk and talk on the blackboard Students or pupils can cram the facts and they can take them to the examination and pass but the examination is over and the facts are also over The inquiry method can substitute the old method
<$D> What other approach do you know to science teaching
<$G> Okay well in science teaching the other methods in science teaching are lecture methods and project methods 
<$D> Do you have any other comments
<$G> Okay to contribute more comments I request the facilitators to organise visits to different schools that have attended this sort of <./>cour this short course to see how far this inquiry approach is being applied by the science teachers and where they come across any problem or difficulties they <-/>they deserve to give a helping hands to motivate and encourage the science teachers This will make room for more science teacher to adopt this modern approach of science teaching in both primary as well as in secondary schools

<$E> This side and this side when you bring near them each other they attract That means they are friend side but you turn other magnet the other side of magnet and bring near the past side of other magnet it turn so that it say this is enemy side
<$A> The congratulation that I want to give them is they noted that uh the magnet have got side that attract each other and they called these sides friends and they noted that they have sides that do not attract each other they repel and they call these enemy That is a very nice observation That is a very nice report
<$A> grouping leaves according to samples
<$O> We took a thin leaf of cognate and keep under the microscope and looked carefully We crushed
<$D> to put the piece of leaf in the test tube quarter filling with water then heat and observe
<$B> The colour of benedict solution change 
<$G> Let us start our presentation
<$J> All our leaves which were observed each one and the result we have got three groups Group one we have seen that there are some leaves that have smooth margin type Group two we have noticed that there are some leaves have margin like this We have given a name zigzag margin and the last one or the last group or the third group has no margin So here we have drawn a diagram to show groups and activity number there we need again all leaves and observe from their stalks and the result was we have seen the leaves divided into two <-/>two groups There are some leaves have leaves stalks and others have not For example a diagram shown these are the leaves having leaves stalk and one among those was not bear leaf stalk like this one and we also do more observation from leaf stalk and we have seen that some of the stalk are slender and look like sponge However uh another part leaf base and parts were having some holes inside That is hole When you say leaf with no margin There is no margin Also if you observe <ea/>Mvinja have no edge like others 
<$E> Only one drawing is what you have labelled a leaf stalk What you have labelled are those leaf stalks
<$J> Yes leaf stalk and leaf base
<$E> Yes this is a leaf base and this is a leaf stalk
<$B> And uh some papers and some other materials are back there so the problem is to find out all you can about the features that are there
<<$O> questions were what the materials are provided Number two What are the properties of materials provided Number three What are the dimension of the different shape Number four What are the sizes of angle of different shape Five What are the lengths of different shape and six I'm sorry here there was a slip of pen It should read What other shapes can be obtained from the given shape Number seven Can we make congruent figure from the given shape Number eight Can we make similar shape from the given shapes So we were supposed to answer question number six What other shapes can be obtained from the given shape Here was the question number six We have <O/> and pentagon by using a triangle and a square That is one shape which we form
<$?> Okay we can confirm
<$O> It is known a pentagon because it has got five sides Another shape which we <-/>we could have obtained from other shapes is we have use we have make a partial structure From this we use one <./>hex <./>hex hexagonal shape structure with six triangles One hexagon with six triangles shape and a star Another shape was we use four square four squares such as this one this one one two three four and then we use four rhombus two rhombus and two triangles and two trapezium We obtain a twelve-sided figure which the name of it which we couldn't get it only the name of a twelve-sided figure
<$?> make further investigation
<$O> Further investigation okay Another figure which we have obtain or another shape which we have obtain is a pentagon using a square between two triangles one square between two triangle This is one triangle and this is one triangle and this is a square Another figure which we obtain is an octagon We arrange four trapezium These are trapeziums and four triangle and a square We end up with an octagon an eight-sided shape Another one was a decagon or a ten-sided figure by using four parallelograms two square two rhombus and one trapezium and one triangle we remain up with a <?/>decagon The last one we do was a <?/>hectagon an eight-sided figure by arranging three triangle 
<$?> Seven
<$O> How many Seven-sided figure by arranging three triangles two parallelograms and a square We get a seven-sided figure which is known as <?/>hectagon and that is all
<$A> materials provided is pawpaw baobao fruits orange grapes tomatoes uh the given fruits eaten by man
<$D> By using litmus paper blue and red identify the this is an activity identify the acidity and the alkalinity of a fruit We get many fruits are acidic
<$E> pawpaw baobaob fruits orange grapes tomatoes We squeeze the juice of each fruit and the juice of each fruit is added to the benedict solution in a test tube and then heated
<$O> Time for presentation uh I hope uh What we understand is that each group has given some part of the presentation in order to overcome the repetition
<$P> Our topic is fruit uh material provided pawpaw tomato orange coconut peas lime banana leech grapes baobaob fruit are the fruits provided in each group Number three All fruits provided have some the same internal structure Number four Do all fruits have the same taste Number five What will be what will happen when given fruit solution tested with A litmus paper B universal indicator C <?/>milo reagent D will answer question number three and question number four Question number three is do all fruits provided have the same internal structure Now we are talking about internal structure of fruits which must be first of all a cutting and observing the internal structure of the fruit provided Now in our observation we know uh we see fruits have the same internal structure e g orange and lime tomato and <ea/>tunguja uh These fruit have the same internal structure like this This is orange and this is lime Inside contains seed <eh> and softer uh like this They divided into layers like that and <ea/>tunguja uh and lime also Now tomato and <ea/>tunguja also the same We get seed many seeds internal and <ea/>tunguja also and some fruits are different in their internal structure e g pawpaw The internal structure is if you cut the pawpaw we can see like this This is internal structure very soft This is uh part This is external part Now the internal structures of peas <-_>the internal structure<-/> of peas <eh> like that There is seeds internal like this and then the internal structure of banana There is some seeds inside and baobaob fruits like this There is a seed
<$B> Now we are inviting questions additions or comments uh anything
<$A> While describing something for instance the position when we mean when we say the seeds are at the centre What do we mean by the seeds are at the centre and how are how they are arranged at that centre at that particular centre Are they arranged longitudinally or things of that sort The way they observe to cut they cut the orange across section it definitely shows they are at the centre but only at a point and actually they are located longitudinally along the axis so this is a sort of observation that we have to make while observing the materials We have to be specific in describing how the thing is rather than at the centre
<$Q> Right and I emphasize that if you want to see the arrangement of a seed you must specify which ways of cutting so you can see the arrangement of seeds cutting longitudinally Also you can see another arrangement of seeds when you cut vertically So you <-/>you <-/>you don't keep it as you say just arrangement of seeds In what position of cutting is important
<$R> My colleague <-_say><+_says> the <-_seed><+_seeds> are concentrated more at the centre. Actually he means that the seeds are not found at the centre because when we say concentrated we mean that the seeds they may be at the centre and others will be a little bit away from the centre That is why he refer concentrated because most of the seeds they are found at that region They are not at the centre They are found in that region meaning that region and if you want to prove that we can cut an orange in any direction you will notice that most of the seeds are very near at the centre They are concentrated very near to the centre That is my point 
<$S> Okay introduction first The materials are selected to be given the participant or say the students The type of material given will depend upon the level of the students or participants or however So the reagents the food test reagents were given to the teachers because we assume that teachers know about the food tests and the litmus papers were given because we guess that was to be given <-_in><+_to> Form One students Form Two students Form Four students different available materials will be given For example if the material is to be conducted in Form One we shall <O/> these for Form One students first there should be another one activity beforehand for the use of the reagents for example <./>differ different food substances will be given to students and they were allowed to play with reagents in each food reagent As a result the teacher then will tell or the if you read on the reagent on to this type of food It <-_mean><+_means> this type of food is starch or this is protein and something like this So you have to consider about the materials given to the students The level of the <-_>of the<_/> students of the learners will lead to the choice of material to be presented during their activities So we should not quarrel
<$F> underestimate the students because they can do something which you don't know So then we decide to give the things to the student we should understand uh I say this they want to they can do the wonderful things so let them do it And you are the teacher You have to live after this <O/> over but under inquiry approach we have to think very carefully on actually what we want to see and that can be facilitated by the question When you frame good questions then it is much easier for you to do investigations and when you frame bad questions then it is very difficult for you to make investigations What I mean here we have good questions and we have bad questions you see So we have to be very conscious on the questions that we have to frame so as to lead us into observation WE have to be very careful uh And that also will be the same <-_to><+_for> the students whom you are going to teach They will be framing questions It is better that when they are framing their questions you go around the groups and help them to modify those questions Definitely they must have an idea that they want to observe but it might be very difficult for them to frame a good question a good observable question so you have to go round them and <-/>and help them reframe their questions so that they will be given to investigation
