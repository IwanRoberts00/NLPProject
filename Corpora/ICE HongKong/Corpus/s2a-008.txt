Good evening ATV viewers and welcome to Trackside Wednesday
evening at Happy Valley <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#2:1:A>
the runners are already at the start for race three let  ' s go and
pick up the live action <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#3:1:B>
So the next one in the paddock parade is uh going to be the
five horse here Lucky King <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#4:1:B>
his first up this season <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#5:1:B>
looks a big long three year old by rhythm <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#6:1:B>
Gary Ng prepares big price one hundred and seventy to one <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#7:1:B>
suppose it  ' s uh simply a matter of watching him and hopefully he
does something nice <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#8:1:A>
Yeah I think uh he showed on his barrier trial that he was
probably going to need a little bit longer yet <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#9:1:A>
and uh he doesn't look as though uh he  ' s completely finished
growing or should we say growing up at uh any rate <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#10:1:A>
he  ' s uh just showing all the signs of a bit of a baby uh here in
the paddock at the moment <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#11:1:A>
he  ' s having a good look at the crowd he  ' s taking it all in around
him <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#12:1:A>
he he looks to be in pretty good order <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#13:1:A>
looks very healthy but uh also looks a bit soft I think he  ' s going
to need the run <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#14:1:C>
Well fair enough <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#15:1:C>
two trials latest behind Legend Away drawn high in gate eight
stepping up now to the 1650 metres <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#16:1:C>
that first run was on a soft track when he was well and truly
beaten <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#17:1:C>
so seventeen hundred and seventy five dollars about him at the
moment <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#18:1:C>
Now horse number <,> one <,> being Wonderful Life <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#19:1:C>
can this the interesting runner of the race <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#20:1:C>
he  ' s come uh back heavier than he was last season when he went out
a winner beating We know When and uh I note when he had his very first race
start he was heavy like he is tonight and he was well beaten <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#21:1:A>
Yes and amazing to think he  ' s heavy because he certainly
doesn't look heavy in any way <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#22:1:A>
uh I was actually thinking he looked as though uh he was a little
bit on the light side <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#23:1:A>
uh not really taken by him Wonderful Light <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#24:1:A>
but he hasn't made his way uh past our position by the side of the
paddock here at the moment he  ' s uh just going to come past us now <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#25:1:A>
and uh not overly taken Darren quite frankly uh definitely prefer
others

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#26:1:B>
Yes and the ones not getting a rap first time out here <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#27:1:B>
first up this season and uh sixty four dollars fifty for Wonderful
Life <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#28:1:B>
I thought you  ' d have to include him but <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#29:1:B>
I dunno <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#30:1:B>
first up I  ' m quite concerned about and the point Darren made is
quite solid <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#31:1:B>
he  ' s a Well Ender too I  ' m I  ' m still struggling to sort them out
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#32:1:B>
They always seem a bit big and raw and seem as though they take a
little bit to really get rolling <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#33:1:B>
Indy  ' s Gem number two he fired up really keenly last time maybe he  ' s
going to travel a bit better <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#34:1:B>
he  ' s got a good barrier draw <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#35:1:B>
the race plan says that he  ' s going to have every chance to night
and he  ' s only sixty six fifty

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#36:1:A>
yes he should get into an ideal position drawn two just get a
little bit of cover and uh well he  ' s certainly one of the uh main serious
chances in this <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#37:1:A>
Douglas White aboard uh for David Oughton <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#38:1:A>
he looks to be okay uh again uh he  ' s just getting a fraction warm
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#39:1:A>
he  ' s a horse that uh can seat up quite badly but uh he looks fit
and he looks as if he  ' s ready to do a job here again tonight Darren

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#40:1:C>
And let  ' s hope he gets a bit more luck uh in the early part
of the race <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#41:1:C>
he  ' s got that nice draw again <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#42:1:C>
beaten four lengths at the end after getting rather fired up and
Douglas White goes on him here tonight <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#43:1:C>
that  ' s a positive aspect <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#44:1:C>
six point six in the betting <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#45:1:C>
number three me and you got a nice run to win here two starts back
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#46:1:C>
the Sha Tin race was beyond him over the eighteen hundred but he
now returns to the venue and the distance where he tends to do his best
racing <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#47:1:A>
Yes he certainly seems to be at his best or reserves his best
for the mile here at Happy Valley <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#48:1:A>
he always takes the eye he  ' s a nice type of horse <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#49:1:A>
he  ' s a big rangy galloper <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#50:1:A>
he does have problems that he has to overcome but uh he  ' s done
pretty well and raced fairly consistently uh I don't I don't think he  ' s ever
a particularly good win bet but as regards a price proposition <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#51:1:A>
again here tonight I think I  ' d want to keep him safe <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#52:1:B>
Yeah I  ' d agree with that he  ' s not the sort of horse I  ' d
ever be saying go out and win bet on <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#53:1:B>
won two of thirty one and for a long time looked as if he was going
to be a nice horse <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#54:1:B>
he wasn't a cheapy <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#55:1:B>
definitely not a cheapy <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#56:1:B>
the American came here at a big price tag <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#57:1:B>
and uh unfortunately hasn't lived up to the expectations <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#58:1:B>


<ICE-HK:S2A-008#59:1:B>
The seven horse Fortune Tycoon wasn't beaten a hopeless margin
first time out but he  ' s got an awkward barrier draw here and he  ' s one
hundred and eighty three dollars fifty <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#60:1:A>
Not overly struck by him either Fortune Tycoon just getting a
little bit warm uh <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#61:1:A>
the trips okay but this is really a horse that seems to show his
best fresh and first up and the fact that he threw in <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#62:1:A>
what I would have said was just an average run first time out uh he  ' s
yet to really prove it second time out normally <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#63:1:A>
I  ' m not going to be with here tonight Darren <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#64:1:C>
Yeah I was expecting a little more from him first up in a race
that looked uh quite suitable he went out at five to one <,> but <,> if he
won I wouldn't be totally surprised <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#65:1:B>
Could we read anything into it that they  ' ve left for so long
to back him up <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#66:1:B>
in the past they  ' re quite happy to back him up fairly quickly <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#67:1:B>
is there anything from the paddock that says that Mark <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#68:1:A>
Which Fortune <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#69:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#70:1:A>
No <,> uh <,> to be honest he  ' s a he  ' s such a long he  ' s a
bit of a long backed horse <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#71:1:A>
he he doesn't he normally trains up a bit light <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#72:1:A>
uhm <,> I  ' m actually very happy with him here tonight but ah <,>
uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#73:1:B>
Now we  ' ve been looking at eight for a bit now how is he
parading at forty four fifty <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#74:1:B>
<A>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#75:1:B>
I thought that  ' s just what we were just talking about

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#76:1:B>
No no seven Fortune Tycoon <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#77:1:B>
I  ' m just saying that they  ' ve left it so long to back him up is
there anything from the paddock to say why <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#78:1:B>
you know his first race was race twenty I would have thought he
would have backed up a lot sooner <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#79:1:A>
Yeah but he doesn't back up does he <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#80:1:A>
that  ' s what we were saying he doesn't <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#81:1:A>
his second runs up are normally very bad so uh I wouldn't be if he  ' s
not fresh today I wouldn't have been interested in him anyway <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#82:1:A>
uh Fortune Glory on the other hand I think <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#83:1:A>
as I say he  ' s a bit of a long backed horse <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#84:1:A>
uh he does look fit <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#85:1:A>
he looks well <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#86:1:A>
it doesn't always impress me with the way he carries his head but
uh I also feel that uh he  ' s run fairly decently in his last two outings
Darren <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#87:1:C>
yeah ran home really well particularly first up behind Mascot
and this is now the race that uh looks suitable <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#88:1:C>
sixteen fifty here <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#89:1:C>
he  ' s run into the placings on a few occasions <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#90:1:C>
nine Applied Supreme I thought ran the best race of his life last
time <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#91:1:C>
and I thought the key was it <,> the key to it <,> was the fact
that that he didn't try and lead <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#92:1:C>
he took the sit behind the speed and he had a had a kick there at
the end <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#93:1:A>
I suppose he could do the same here again he needs to work his
way across from gate seven <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#94:1:A>
uhm he doesn't look great in his coat at the moment but as you say
he probably did put up the best performance of his life last time out <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#95:1:A>
so uh I don't suppose I should be taking a too blunt an attitude
over it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#96:1:A>
uhm I  ' m not really taken by him but as I say that was a good
effort last time <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#97:1:B>
yeah I think you  ' d have to find a place for him because of
that last run <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#98:1:B>
he  ' s got an awkward barrier draw but uh that might set a few
people off <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#99:1:B>
uh Martial Hero <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#100:1:B>
he  ' s got some quick track work gallops down to his name in the
uhm write ups <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#101:1:B>
a few runs he  ' s dashed home in twenty three and a half and twenty
two seven <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#102:1:B>
is going round at nine hundred and fifty dollars though

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#103:1:A>
He  ' s weak <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#104:1:A>
he  ' s weak behind the saddle <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#105:1:A>
he  ' s got no depth behind the saddle at the moment uh I don't like
the way he walks either he tends to just stumble along behind he doesn't get
his hocks underneath him <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#106:1:A>
uhm not for me not at the moment just <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#107:1:A>
not fully matured and not strong enough <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#108:1:C>
Beaten a dozen first up on the soft going uh behind
Refreshingly blinkers applied to him for the first time <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#109:1:C>
Stephen Baster riding for Wong Siu tang is nine hundred and forty
three dollars <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#110:1:C>
number eleven Millennium Legend has had the benefit of three runs
this season he  ' s got a bit of pace but he just doesn't seem to be going as
well as he was last year <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#111:1:A>
Is that Millennium Legend <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#112:1:C>
Millennium <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#113:1:A>
Ha ha uh I don't like him he  ' s got very very warm here
tonight <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#114:1:A>
again he can do this from time to time I just thought <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#115:1:A>
early on this season he had really settled down and uh he was
remarkably cool but uh <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#116:1:A>
tonight he  ' s getting back to normal and he  ' s absolutely black
with sweat uh not taken by him uh I didn't think he had the easiest of runs
last time though

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#117:1:B>
Okay that  ' s the eleven horse uh he  ' s one hundred and twenty
dollars <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#118:1:B>
as you can see twelve on screen at the moment Telecom Twin one o
five and twelve dollars fifty <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#119:1:B>
uh he sat forward in midfield first time out and uh he got a bump
at the three hundred metres he was angling out and uh I I had sorted had
questioned how <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#120:1:B>
well he was going to finish off that time and then last time out I
think he did his best running fifth here over the eighteen hundred metres <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#121:1:B>
comes back in trip tonight <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#122:1:B>
think he  ' s got a slim chance but I don't know if you could run
out and win bet him <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-008#123:1:A>
I think this is a good jockey booking actually <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#124:1:A>
Shane Dye I think will suit Telecom Twin ideally <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#125:1:A>
I think he needs to be ridden cold he  ' s quite an excitable type
of horse <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#126:1:A>
he  ' s just uh getting into a bit of a sweat now <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#127:1:A>
but again he  ' s looking far stronger than he has done for quite
some time he  ' s keeping the condition on him <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#128:1:A>
ahh I  ' d be more than happy that he could uh run well here Telecom
Twin <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-008#129:1:A>
uh I do say I don't think he  ' s a win bet but I do think he  ' s one
of those horses that could finish in the frame and uh I think he  ' s a horse
that Shane Dye will suit </I>
